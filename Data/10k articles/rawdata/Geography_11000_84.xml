'''A9.com''' is a [[subsidiary]] of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] that develops [[search engine technology|search engine]] and [[search advertising]] technology. A9 is based in [[Palo Alto, California]], with teams in [[Bangalore]], [[Beijing]], [[Dublin]], [[Iași]], [[Munich]] and [[Tokyo]]. A9 has development efforts in areas of product search, cloud search, visual search, augmented reality, advertising technology and community question answering.

==History==

A9 was created by Amazon.com in 2003 as an independent company aimed at producing technology for search and advertising. They moved into the building previously used by the [[DEC Systems Research Center]] in [[Palo Alto, California]]. 
One purpose of A9.com was to leverage [[algorithm]]s, and the name was chosen as a [[numeronym]] to represent that word (i.e. 'A' + 9 other letters).
The office was in [[Silicon Valley]], near [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="udi04"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Can Amazon Unplug Google? |work=Business 2.0 |author=John Battelle |date=April 15, 2004 |url=http://www.business2.com/b2/web/articles/0,17863,611251,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040416090804/http://www.business2.com/b2/web/articles/0%2C17863%2C611251%2C00.html |archivedate=April 16, 2004 |accessdate=November 15, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the direction of its first president, [[Udi Manber]], A9 focused on several areas, including the A9.com destination website,
product search, and a search advertising platform.  Some early A9 services such as "search inside the book" continued, while others have been discontinued.  
The A9 search engine powers product search for Amazon.com and several other eCommerce retailers.

In February 2006, Manber was replaced by [[David L. Tennenhouse]] as president.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/08/AR2006020802243.html |title= Google Hires Amazon Executive |date= February 9, 2006 |work= [[The Washington Post]] |accessdate= November 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In September 2006, William Stasior, one of A9's founders and a former [[AltaVista]] and Amazon.com executive, was named president.
In June 2009, A9 acquired SnapTell, which developed smartphone-based visual search applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Image Recognition Startup SnapTell Acquired by Amazon Subsidiary A9.com |author= Leena Rao |date= June 16, 2009 |work= Tech Crunch |url= https://techcrunch.com/2009/06/16/image-recognition-startup-snaptell-acquired-by-amazon-subsidiary-a9com/ |accessdate= November 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stasior left in October 2012 to join [[Apple Inc.]] and work on [[Siri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Apple Nabs Amazon A9 Exec Stasior to Run Siri — But Does Hire Signal a Bigger Move Into Search? |date= October 15, 2012 |author= Kara Swisher |work= All Things D |url= http://allthingsd.com/20121015/exclusive-apple-hires-amazon-a9s-stasior-to-run-siri-does-hire-signal-a-bigger-move-into-search/ |accessdate= November 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brian Pinkerton, who had developed [[WebCrawler]] in the 1990s,  became general manager of A9 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Leading Leaders |work= A9 Management web page |url= https://www.a9.com/about-us/management/ |archivedate= November 14, 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161114072240/https://www.a9.com/about-us/management/ |accessdate= November 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Search engines we have known ... before Google crushed them |author= Brid-Aine Parnell |date= December 18, 2012 |work= The Register |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/12/18/search_engines_we_have_known/?page=3 |accessdate= November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Past projects==

===A9.com search portal===

A9.com originally operated a [[web portal|search portal]], along with an A9 [[toolbar]], which was first demonstrated on April 14, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Amazon's Much Discussed a9 Goes Live |date= April 14, 2004 |author= Gary Price |work= Resource Shelf |url= http://www.resourceshelf.com/archives/2004_04_01_resourceshelf_archive.html#108196836452740143 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040416222616/http://www.resourceshelf.com/archives/2004_04_01_resourceshelf_archive.html#10819683645274014 |archivedate= April 16, 2004 |accessdate= November 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The service featured some innovative design elements, allowing users to choose from over 400 sources to search and view results in separate columns grouped by source. In addition to web search results, users could get product search results from Amazon, encyclopedia results from [[Wikipedia]], movie information from [[IMDb]], and others, starting in September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Amazon to Take Searches On Web to a New Depth |author= [[John Markoff]] |work= New York Times |date= September 15, 2004 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/business/technology/technology-amazon-to-take-searches-on-web-to-a-new.html |accessdate= November 17, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Web search results were provided by different search engines over time.  The search portal functionality was discontinued in 2008.

===Open Search===

A9 developed a protocol called [[OpenSearch]] that enabled the "plug-in" search source functionality from the A9.com portal.  The original specification, OpenSearch 1.0, was released in March 2005.  A9 made the protocol freely available through a [[Creative Commons]] license. OpenSearch is now{{When|date=November 2016}} maintained by the OpenSearch.org community.

===BlockView===

A9 developed the first service that allowed users of maps and "[[yellow pages]]" (a [[telephone directory]]) to view buildings at street level.  Called BlockView, the service was announced in January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author= Kurt Peters |title= Yellow Pages Go Visual with Block View at Amazon's A9.com |work= Internet Retailer |date= January 27, 2005 |url= http://www.internetretailer.com/2005/01/27/yellow-pages-go-visual-with-block-view-at-amazon-s-a9-com |accessdate= November 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a year, the service included images for 24 US cities.  Both BlockView and maps (as well as support for the A9 tool bar) were discontinued in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= So Long to A9's Block Level Imagery, Yellow Pages, Tollbar and Amazon.com Discount |work= Resource Shelf |date= October 1, 2006 |url= http://www.resourceshelf.com/2006/10/01/search-briefs-a9-discontinues-many-features-yahoo-to-open-yahoo-mail-api/ |archivedate= October 5, 2006 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061005033120/http://www.resourceshelf.com/2006/10/01/search-briefs-a9-discontinues-many-features-yahoo-to-open-yahoo-mail-api/ |accessdate= November 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clickriver===

In November 2006, A9 announced Clickriver, an advertising program that let third parties place advertisements on Amazon.com pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Amazon.com's Clickriver Pay-Per-Click Search Advertising |author= Loren Baker |work= Search Engine Journal |date= November 3, 2006 |url= https://www.searchenginejournal.com/amazoncoms-clickriver-ppc-to-bypass-google-adwords/3972/ |accessdate= November 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Clickriver focused primarily on products and services that complemented Amazon's own offerings.  For example, if a customer viewed a television on Amazon, a Clickriver ad might offer installation services in his or her local area.  Clickriver was discontinued in 2010, replaced by other Amazon advertising programs.

=== Community question answering ===
A9 operated [[Askville]], a community-based [[question-and-answer site]] first tested in December 2006. Service began in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Aarthi Sivaraman |date= November 29, 2007 |publisher= Reuters |title= Amazon Launches Askville.com |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/11/29/us-amazon-askville-idUSWNAS341420071129 |accessdate= November 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Compared with other question-and-answer sites, Askville focused more on social interaction, allowing users to follow other users as well as track specific topics.
On October 25, 2013, Askville was shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Dear Askville Community |work= Final web site |url= http://www.askville.com/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140110015731/http://www.askville.com/ |archivedate= January 10, 2014 |accessdate= November 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloud search===
CloudSearch is a managed [[Amazon Web Services]] service that makes client data searchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Timothy Prickett Morgan |title= Amazon Turns A9 Search Engine into a Cloud Service |work= The Register |date=  April 12, 2012 |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/04/12/amazon_aws_cloudsearch |accessdate= November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a business that wanted to allow customers to search their catalog could upload the catalog entries to CloudSearch and then route search requests from their application or web site to the service.  CloudSearch instances could be brought online as data or traffic volume demanded.  Sites using CloudSearch included [[SmugMug]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://news.smugmug.com/2012/04/12/smugmugs-sexy-new-search/ |title= SmugMug's Sexy New Search |work= SmugMug Blog |date= April 12, 2012 |accessdate= November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sage Bionetworks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On the Shoulders of Giants |date=April 12, 2012 |author=Michael Kellen |work=Science, Reengineered blog |url=http://sciencereengineered.com/2012/04/14/on-the-shoulders-of-giants/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427153704/http://sciencereengineered.com/2012/04/14/on-the-shoulders-of-giants/ |archivedate=April 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Amazon moved away from using A9 for CloudSearch to technology based on [[Apache Solr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Amazon CloudSearch - Even Better Searching for Less Than $100/Month |work= Amazon Web Service blog |author= Jeff Barr |date= March 24, 2014  |url= http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2014/03/amazon-cloudsearch-even-better-searching-for-less-than-100month.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Amazon’s CloudSearch gets Solr Powered! |work= Lucidworks blog |date= March 25, 2014 |url= https://lucidworks.com/blog/2014/03/25/amazons-cloudsearch-gets-solr-powered/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent projects==

===Product search===
A9 continued to develop and operate the service that provides search on all nine Amazon.com sites, as well as other retail sites owned by Amazon such as [[Endless.com]], Javari.de, and [[Audible.com]].  In addition, A9 search is also used by other retailers, such as [[Marks &amp; Spencer]],&lt;ref&gt;"Marks &amp; Spencer Launches Website in Collaboration with Amazon," ''Computer Weekly,'' March 23, 2007. [http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240080492/Marks-Spencer-launches-website-in-collaboration-with-Amazon]&lt;/ref&gt; that license the Amazon retail platform for their online presence.

A9 provided the "search inside the book" capability for Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Price, "Amazon Debuts New Book Search Tool," ''Search Engine Watch,'' October 26, 2003 [http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2064555/Amazon-Debuts-New-Book-Search-Tool]&lt;/ref&gt; Announced in 2003, this service allows customers to search through the full text of hundreds of thousands of books.  This feature is available both for searching individual books and for the entire book catalog. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Welcome to History 2.0 |work= Newsweek by the Daily Beast |author= Steven Levy |date= November 9, 2003 |url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2003/11/09/welcome-to-history-2-0.html |deadurl= yes |archivedate= May 6, 2012 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120506145828/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2003/11/09/welcome-to-history-2-0.html |accessdate= November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual search===

The visual search group at A9 created  mobile applications that recognize objects and allow users to find these products on Amazon.com.  Their first augmented reality app, Flow, provided both object and barcode recognition. It was released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author= Will Shanklin |title= Flow for iPhone is the product ID App We Have Been Waiting For |work= Geek.com |date= November 3, 2011 |url= http://www.geek.com/articles/mobile/flow-for-iphone-is-the-product-id-app-we-have-been-waiting-for-2011113 |accessdate= November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Flow iPhone app |work= iTunes |url= https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flow-powered-by-amazon/id474664425 |accessdate= November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A9 visual search technology powers features to let customers search for certain products (such as shoes) by shape, and find visually similar items on Amazon.com, [[Zappos.com]], Endless.com, and other retail sites.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Advertising technology===

A9's advertising technology group began delivering sponsored link advertisements on the Amazon.com retail Web site in 2003 and continued to manage this program for Amazon properties. A9 also invests in display advertising technology, including technology for Amazon's ad-supported e-reader, the [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] with special offers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8949">In 1991, [[Azerbaijan]] joined the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] and started to build relations with the organization. As a result, the ambassador of Azerbaijan to [[Saudi Arabia]] was given a mandate of permanent representative of Azerbaijan to the General Secretariat of the OIC in May 1994.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.az/en/content/550|title=AZERBAIJAN AND OIC|last=FS|website=www.mfa.gov.az|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cooperation ==
A former Azerbaijani President [[Heydar Aliyev]] met with the OIC Secretary General in [[Baku]] in 1994. Furthermore, Heydar Aliyev attended the 7th Summit of Heads of States and Governments of the OIC member countries in Casablanca and made a speech in that year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2005, current Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev attended the 3rd Extraordinary Summit of the OIC in Mecca. In 2015, President Aliyev met with the Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), [[Iyad bin Amin Madani|Iyad Ameen Madan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oic-oci.org/topic/?t_id=9953&amp;ref=3944&amp;lan=en|title=OIC Secretary General receives the President of Azerba...|website=www.oic-oci.org|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baku hosted the 33rd OIC Foreign Ministers Conference in 19–21 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww1.oic-oci.org/baku2006/english/documents.htm|title=The Thirty-Third Session of The Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers|website=ww1.oic-oci.org|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Mehriban Aliyeva]], the President of [[Heydar Aliyev Foundation]] initiated to organize International Forum on “Expanding the Role of Women in Cross-Cultural Dialogue” in Baku on June 10–11, 2008.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oic-oci.org/topic/?t_id=13550&amp;ref=5905&amp;lan=en|title=The 4th Islamic Solidarity Games Officially Opens in B...|website=www.oic-oci.org|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The delegation led by [[Elmar Mammadyarov]], Azerbaijani FM regularly participates at the OIC Foreign Ministers conferences.

On 22–23 November 2011, the Islamic Conference Youth Forum for Dialogue and Cooperation (ICYF-DC), Heydar Aliyev Foundation and Azerbaijani Government organized the Founding Convention of the OIC Countries Young Entrepreneurs Network in Baku. ICYEN is a collaborative initiative to create a platform for young Muslim entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.icyf-dc.org/icyen-was-established-in-baku-2/|title=ICYEN WAS ESTABLISHED IN BAKU|date=2011-11-25|work=Islamic Conference Youth Forum for Dialogue and Cooperation|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the 4th [[Islamic Solidarity Games]] was held in Azerbaijan. An official opening ceremony was organized in Baku on May 12, 2017.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Furthermore, Azerbaijan has achieved cooperation with other bodies of the OIC. In this regard, Azerbaijan’s First Lady and also head of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation Mehriban Aliyeva’s activities must be noted which contributed to the development of ties between Azerbaijan and the OIC. Therefore, Aliyeva was awarded with the diploma on [[Goodwill ambassador|Goodwill Ambassador]] of the [[Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|ISESCO]] by the Director General of the ISESCO Dr. Abdulaziz Othman Altwaijri for her deeds to bring civilizations closer in 26 November 2006 .

On 3 May 2017, a delegation led by Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) [[Yousef Al-Othaimeen]] met with Azerbaijani President [[Ilham Aliyev]]. The meeting involved the discussions over the solidarity and cooperation between [[Muslim]] countries, Azerbaijan’s successful membership to the OIC and tourism potentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.president.az/mobile/articles/23501|title=President.Az -|website=en.president.az|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The OIC and Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict ==
[[Armenia]]-Azerbaijan, [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]] became one of the topic for discussions since Azerbaijan had been admitted to the membership of the OIC . The OIC adopted a number of resolutions regarding the conflict condemning the occupation of the Azerbaijani territories by Armenia:

Documents and resolutions on Armenia-Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh conflict were approved at the OIC Foreign Ministers conferences, too. For instance, resolution No. 10/42-POL “On the Aggression of the Republic of Armenia against the Republic of Azerbaijan” adopted in the framework of the Forty Second Session of the Council of Foreign Ministers, held in [[Kuwait]], State of Kuwait on 27–28 May 2015. The resolution strongly condemns Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan, considers the actions committed by the Armenian Armed Forces against the Azerbaijani civilians and other protected persons as crimes against humanity and calls the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] to recognize the existence of aggression against Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oic-oci.org/subweb/cfm/42/en/42cfm_res_pol_r2_en.pdf|title=Resolutions On Political Affairs Adopted by the 42nd Session of the Council of Foreign Ministers Session of Joint Vision to Strengthen Tolerance and Reject Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World.jpg|thumb|''Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World'']]
The '''''Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World''''' is a large-format English language atlas of ancient [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and North [[Africa]], edited by [[Richard Talbert|Richard J. A. Talbert]]. The time period depicted is roughly from [[Archaic Greece|archaic Greek]] civilization (pre-550 BC) through [[Late Antiquity]] (640 AD). The atlas was published by [[Princeton University Press]] in 2000. The book was the winner of the 2000 [[Association of American Publishers]] [[PROSE Awards|Award for Best Professional/Scholarly Multivolume Reference Work in the Humanities]].

==Overview==
The main (atlas) volume contains 102 color topographic maps, covering territory from the [[British Isles]] and the [[Azores]] and eastward to [[Afghanistan]] and western [[China]]. The size of the volume is 33 x 48&amp;nbsp;cm. A 45-page [[gazetteer]] is also included in the atlas volume. The atlas is accompanied by a map-by-map directory on CD-ROM, in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format, including a search index. The map-by-map directory is also available in print as a two-volume, 1,500 page edition.

According to the editor, the purpose of each map is to offer an up-to-date presentation of the important physical and covered features of the area, using all available literal, epigraphic, and archaeological data.

Most of the maps are of the scale 1:1,000,000 or 1:500,000. However, the environs of the three greater centers ([[Athens]], [[Rome]], [[Byzantium]]-[[Constantinople]]) are presented in 1:150,000. Some remote regions, where Greeks and Romans mostly explored and traded rather than settled (i.e. [[Baltic region|Baltic]], [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]]), are of the scale 1:5,000,000. Due to the nature of the base maps used for the background and time–cost restrictions, elevation lines (contours) were left in feet except for the 1:150,000 maps where they are in meters. The [[Map projection|projection]] of the maps is [[Lambert conformal conic projection|Lambert Conformal Conic]]. Again due to time and cost restrictions, [[Georeference|geo-referencing]] of the maps was left as a future separate project.

Effort was spent to show the physical landscape in its ancient rather than modern aspect. As expected, this task often met insurmountable difficulties, due to the lack of data. In those cases, at least an effort was made to eliminate known modern features and to restore the affected landscapes.

The atlas' production began in 1988 at the [[University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill]], and involved a team of 221 classicists and 22 map makers.&lt;ref name=NYTBR&gt;{{cite news|author=[[D. J. R. Bruckner]]|date=March 4, 2001|title=Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/04/books/books-in-brief-nonfiction-052841.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times Book Review]]|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was funded by $4.5 million—"an unusually large sum for a project in the humanities"&lt;ref name=NYT-Wilford&gt;{{cite news|author=[[John Noble Wilford]]|date=December 12, 2000|title=An Atlas Unveils the Intricacies of Ancient Worlds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/12/science/an-atlas-unveils-the-intricacies-of-ancient-worlds.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=D5}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in federal and private donations. The largest individual contributor was Robert B. Strassler's family philanthropy ''The Barrington Foundation'' which supported the project with over $1 million and for which, in accordance with the donor's wishes, the atlas is named. (The foundation, in turn, is named after the Strassler family's place of residence, [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]].)&lt;ref name=APAN&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Talbert|date=October 1999|title=Classical Atlas Project|url=https://classicalstudies.org/sites/default/files/documents/newsletters/October_1999.pdf#page=4|newspaper=[[American Philological Association]] [[Newsletter]]|pages=2–4|volume=22|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richard J. A. Talbert|title= Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World: the Cartographic Fundamentals in Retrospect|url=http://www.cartographicperspectives.org/index.php/journal/article/view/cp46-talbert/539|journal=[[Cartographic Perspectives]]|issue=46|pages=4–27|doi=10.14714/CP46.484|year=Fall 2003|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}}

The atlas provides an up-to-date reference for ancient geography, superseding [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]'s ''An Atlas of Ancient Geography, Biblical and Classical'' (London: John Murray, 1872–1874), the last successfully completed attempt to comprehensively map the [[Greco-Roman world]] and reflect the state of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite journal|author=Richard J. A. Talbert|title=Mapping the classical world: major atlases and map series 1872-1990|url=http://www.journalofromanarch.com/v5_thum_page.html|journal=[[Journal of Roman Archaeology]]|volume=5|pages=5–38|doi=10.1017/S1047759400011922|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ongoing wiki-like on-line large scale collaboration for maintaining and diversifying the ''Barrington Atlas'' data-set is carried on by the Pleiades Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pleiades.stoa.org |title=pleiades.stoa.org |website=Pleiades.stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Period coverage==
The time period covered is roughly from 1000 BC up to c. AD 640, categorized as following:
*[[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic period]] (pre-550 BC]
*[[Classical antiquity|Classical period]] (550–330 BC)
*[[Hellenistic period]] / [[Roman Republic#Mid-Republic (264–133 BC)|Middle to Late Republican period]] at Rome (330 BC–30 BC)
*[[Principate|Early Roman Empire]] (30 BC–AD 300)
*[[Late Antiquity]] (300–640)
All eras are covered in every map (i.e. there are not separate maps for different periods of the same region).

==Naming conventions==
The Latin titles given to the regional categories and to the individual maps (see below) are no more than generalized identifications. E.g. Internum Mare (literally, "Internal Sea") is the region around Mediterranean Sea.

Inside maps, ancient names are underlined with specific colors, when they are applicable only to a specific era. Where modern names are used, they are printed in different (sans-serif) font. For the physical features, standard Latin descriptive terms are usually used (e.g. Lacus for Lake, Mons for Mountain). Explanations for these terms are given in the Map Key. When there is doubt whether the name correctly applies to a feature or area, it is followed by a question mark. When only the approximate location is known, the name is italicized.

==Atlas volume contents==
*Contributors, Reviewers, Cartographers
*Preface, Introduction, Guidelines for Reference
*[[MapQuest]] Production Data, Map Bases
*Six small-scale overview maps at 1:5,000,000:
**Map Key, Internum Mare ([[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean Sea]])
**[[Hibernia]]-[[Scandinavia]]
**Asia Occidentalis ([[Southwest Asia]])
**[[South Arabia|Arabia]]-[[Azania]]
**[[India]]
**Asia Orientalis ([[Bactria]], [[Sogdiana]], [[Arachosia]], [[Indus]] valley)
*Then 93 maps are divided into six regional categories :
**Part 1: Europa Septentrionalis ([[Northern Europe]])
**Part 2: [[Hispania]]-[[Ancient Libya|Libya]]
**Part 3: [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]]
**Part 4: [[Greece|Graecia]]-[[Asia Minor]]
**Part 5: [[Greater Syria|Syria]]-[[Meroe]]
**Part 6: [[Pontus Euxinus]]-[[Persian Gulf|Persicus Sinus]]-Bactria
*Then the provinces of the Roman Empire are presented in three 1:10,000,000 maps:
**Provinces at the death of [[Trajan]] (117)
**Dioceses and provinces according to the [[Verona List]] (c. 303-324)
**Dioceses and provinces according to [[Synecdemus]] of [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]] (late 5th - early 6th century)
*Gazetteer

==Map-by-map directory contents==
The two volumes&lt;ref name="Talbert2000"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Richard J. A. Talbert|title=Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World: Map-by-Map Directory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_FHmc_E2uQC|year=2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-04945-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and the CD-ROM) contain:
* Guidelines
* Abbreviations
* A separate directory for each map whose main components are:
** an introductory text
** a listing of names and features (with period, modern name and literature reference information)
** a bibliography

The CD-ROM also contains the gazetteer in PDF format and an installer of the version 4 of [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] [[Acrobat Reader]] with Search for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]]. However, on Windows systems with the latest version of the Adobe Acrobat Reader already installed, installation of the version 4 might lead to incompatibility problems.

The supplied PDF index file BATLINDX.PDX is readable for Acrobat Reader versions up to and including version 9.
For version X and later, using the "Use Advanced Search Options" item in the "Edit" menu may be a workaround.
However, searching the complete index directory will take a while and with each new search the scanning of PDF files starts again from scratch. In general it will be faster to look for a name in the index. So, though the atlas claims to be "a reference work of permanent value",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Elliott |url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/cl_atlas/ |title=Classical Atlas Project |website=Unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a simple Acrobat Reader update will cripple its usability even for users who have the printed version of the map-by-map directory available, because the index shows only the main entries for each object.

The map-by-map directory and the gazetteer are also available in PDF format at the Princeton University Press website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://press.princeton.edu/B_ATLAS/B_ATLAS.PDF |format=PDF |title=Map-By-Map Directory |website=Press.princeton.edu |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2013, a free download of the CD-ROM as a [[ZIP file]] was offered as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/B_ATLAS.ZIP |format=ZIP |title=Atlas |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2017-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507083500/http://press.princeton.edu/B_ATLAS.ZIP |archivedate=2013-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==iPad version==
In November 2013, PUP released an iPad 2+ App version of the Atlas which retailed at a 95% discount from the hardcover edition making it more accessible to the average reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awmc.unc.edu/wordpress/blog/2013/10/31/barrington-atlas-of-the-greek-and-roman-world-for-ipad-2/|title=''Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World'' for iPad 2+|work=Ancient World Mapping Center|publisher=University of North Carolina|date=October 31, 2013|accessdate=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT-Biersdorfer&gt;{{cite news|author=J.

==Sub-disciplines==

The various subbranches of climatic geomorhpology focus on specific climatic environments. 

===Desert geomorphology===
Desert geomorphology or the geomorphology of arid and semi-arid lands shares many landsforms and processes with more humid regions. One distinctive feature is the sparse or lacking [[vegetation]] cover, which influences fluvial and slope processes, related to [[aeolian processes|wind]] and [[Weathering#Salt_weathering|salt activity]].&lt;ref&gt;Goudie 2013, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Early work on desert geomorphology was done by Western explorers of the colonies of their respective countries in Africa ([[French West Africa]], [[German South West Africa]], [[Libyan Desert|Western Egypt]]), in frontier regions of their own countries ([[Western United States|American West]], [[Outback|Australian Outback]]) or in the deserts of foreign countries such as the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Russian Empire]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;Goudie 2013, pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s desert geomorphology in Earth has served to find analogues to [[Geology of Mars|Martian landscapes]].&lt;ref&gt;Goudie 2013, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Periglacial geomorphology===
{{further|Periglaciation}}
As a discipline periglacial geomorphology is close but different to [[Quaternary science]] and [[geocryology]]. Periglacial geomorphology is concerned with non-glacial cold-climate landforms in areas with and without [[permafrost]].&lt;ref name=French2007-8&gt;French 2007, p.  8&lt;/ref&gt;
Albeit the definition of what a periglacial zone is not clear-cut a conservative estimate is that a quarter of Earth's land surface has periglacial conditions. Beyond this quarter an additional quarter or fifth or Earth's land surface had periglacial conditions at some time during the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name=French2007-11-13&gt;French 2007, pp.  11–13&lt;/ref&gt; In periglacial geomorphology noted researchers include [[Johan Gunnar Andersson]], [[Walery Łoziński]], [[Anders Rapp]] and [[Jean Tricart]].&lt;ref name=Gutix2/&gt;

===Tropical geomorphology===
If the tropics is defined as the area between 35° N and 35° S, then about 60% of Earth's surface lies within this zone.&lt;ref name=GuptaIntro2011&gt;Gupta 2011, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; During most of the 20th century tropical geomorphology was neglected due to a bias towards [[temperate climate]]s, and when dealt with it was highlighted as "[[Exoticism|exotic]]".&lt;ref name=Thomas2004/&gt; Tropical geomorphology do mainly differ from other areas in the intensities and rates at which surface processes operate, and not by the type of processes.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta 2011, "Foreword"&lt;/ref&gt; The tropics are characterized by particular climates, that may be dry or humid. Relative to [[temperate zone]]s the tropics contain areas of high temperatures, high [[rainfall intensity|rainfall intensities]] and high [[evapotranspiration]] all of which are climatic features relevant for surface processes.&lt;ref name=GuptaIntro2011/&gt; Another characteristic, that is not related to present-day climate per see, is that a large portion of the tropics have a [[planation surface|low relief]] which was inherited from the continent of [[Gondwana]].&lt;ref&gt;Gupta 2011, pp. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|See for example the extensive [[African Surface]].}} Julius Büdel, Pierre Birot and Jean Tricart have suggested that tropical rivers are dominated by fine-grained suspended load derived from advanced [[chemical weathering]], and this would make them less erosive than rivers elsewhere. Some landforms previously thought as typically tropical like [[bornhardt]]s are more related to [[lithology]] and [[structural geology|rock structure]] than climate.&lt;ref name=Thomas2004&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Thomas|first=Michael F.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Tropical geomorphology|year=2004|pages=1063–1069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphoclimatic zones==
[[File:Lut Desert Yardangs by Hadi Karimi.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Yardang]]s in [[Lut Desert]], [[Kerman Province]], [[Iran]]. Deserts constitute undisputed morphoclimatic zones.]]
Climatic geomorphologists have devised various schemes that divide Earth's surface into various [[morphoclimatic zones]]; that is, zones where landforms are associated to present or past climates.&lt;ref name=Gutix2/&gt; However, only some processes and landforms can be associated with particular climates, meaning that they are ''zonal;'' processes and landforms not associated with particular climates are labelled ''[[azonal]]''.&lt;ref name=Gutix2/&gt; Despite this, azonal processes and landforms might still take on particular characteristics when developing under the influence of particular climates.&lt;ref&gt;French 2007, pp. 248–268&lt;/ref&gt; When identified, morphoclimatic zones do usually lack sharp boundaries and tend to grade from one type to another resulting in that only the core of the zone has all expected attributes. Influential morphoclimatic zoning schemes are those of [[Julius Büdel]] (1948, 1963, 1977) and of [[Jean Tricart]] and [[André Cailleux]] (1965).&lt;ref name=Gutix2/&gt; Büdel's schemes stresses [[planation surface|planation]] and [[river incision|valley-cutting]] in relation to climate, arguing the valley-cutting is dominant in subpolar regions while planation is so in the tropics. As such this scheme is concerned not only with processes but also with end-products of geomorphic activity. The scheme of Tricart and Cailleux emphasizes the relationship between geomorphology, climate and vegetation.&lt;ref name=Sarre1993&gt;{{cite book |last=Sarre |first=R.D. |date=1993 |chapter=Climatic geomorphology |url=https://books.google.fi/books?id=6uchDIKQV0UC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22Peritropical+zone+of+excessive+planation%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n4rwR-esfY&amp;sig=eJyN50pe41wIm6SUP8Wqy0Sck0Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Peritropical%20zone%20of%20excessive%20planation%22&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of the Solid Earth Sciences|editor-last=Kearey|editor-first=Philip |location= |publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd. |page=112–114 |isbn=0-632-03699-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An early attempt at morphoclimatic zoning is that of [[Albrecht Penck]] in 1910, who divided Earth in three zones depending on the [[evaporation]]-[[precipitation]] ratios.&lt;ref name=Sarre1993/&gt; 

A 1994 review argues that only the concepts of [[desert]], [[glaciation|glacial]], [[periglaciation|periglacial]] and a few coastal{{efn-ua|[[Coral reef]]s occur only in tropical waters.}} morphoclimatic zones are justified. These zones amounts to about half of Earth's land surface, the remaining half cannot be explained in simple terms by climate-landform interactions.&lt;ref name=TwidaleLageat1994&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Twidale |first1=C.R. |author-link=Charles Rowland Twidale|last2=Lageat |first2=Y. |date=1994 |title=Climatic geomorphology: a critique |url= |journal=[[Progress in Physical Geography]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=319–334 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The limitations of morphoclimatic zoning were already discussed by [[Siegfried Passarge]] in 1926 who considered vegetation and the extent of [[regolith|weathered material]] as having more direct impact than climate in many parts of the World.&lt;ref name=Sarre1993/&gt; According to M.A. Summerfield large-scale zoning of the [[Terrain|relief]] of Earth's surface is better explained on the basis of [[plate tectonics]] than on climate.&lt;ref name=Migon2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield, M.A. (ed.). (2000), Geomorphology and global tectonics, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this are the [[Scandinavian Mountains#Geology|Scandinavian Mountains]] whose [[paleic surface|plateau areas]] and valleys relate to the history of uplift and not to climate.&lt;ref name=Migon2006/&gt;

[[Piotr Migoń]] has questioned the validity of certain morphoclimatic zonation schemes since they are named after processes, like [[planation surface|planation]], that might not occurring at all in large swathes of the zone. Referring to the 1977 scheme of Büdel Migoń states:&lt;ref name=Migon2006/&gt;  
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it really helpful to have the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt|Volcanic Cordillera of Mexico]], coastal ranges of southeast Brazil, plains of [[East Africa]], the escarpments  of  [[Western  Ghats]]  and  the mountains  of  [[Taiwan]]  in  the  same  zone, labelled as the ‘peritropical zone of excessive planation’?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Historical development==
During the age of [[New Imperialism]] in the late 19th century European explorers and scientists traveled across the globe bringing descriptions of landscapes and landforms. As geographical knowledge increased over time these observations were systematized in a search for regional patterns. Climate emerged thus as prime factor for explaining landform distribution at a grand scale. The rise of climatic geomorphology was foreshadowed by the work of [[Wladimir Köppen]], [[Vasily Dokuchaev]] and [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|Andreas Schimper]]. [[William Morris Davis]], the leading geomorphologist of his time, recognized the role of climate by complementing his "normal" temperate climate [[cycle of erosion]] with arid and glacial ones.&lt;ref name=TwidaleLageat1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goudie2004&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Goudie|first=A.S.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|author-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Climatic geomorphology|year=2004|pages=162–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, interest in climatic geomorphology was also a reaction ''against'' [[Cycle of erosion|Davisian geomorphology]] that was by the mid-20th century considered both un-innovative and dubious.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Attack&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flemal |first=Ronald C. |last2= |first2= |date=1971 |title=The Attack on the Davisian System Of Geomorphology: A Synopsis |url= |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages=3–13 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early climatic geomorphology developed primarily in [[continental Europe]] while in the English-speaking world the tendency was not explicit until L.C. Peltier's 1950 publication on a [[periglaciation|periglacial]] cycle of erosion.&lt;ref name=TwidaleLageat1994/&gt;

Climatic geomorphology was criticized in a 1969 [[review article]] by [[Geomorphology#Quantitative_and_process_geomorphology|process geomorphologist]] [[David Stoddart (geographer)|D.R. Stoddart]].&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2004/&gt; The criticism by Stoddart proved "devastating" sparking a decline in the popularity of climatic geomorphology in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2004/&gt; Stoddart criticized climatic geomorphology for applying supposedly "trivial" methodologies in establishing landform differences between morphoclimatic zones, being linked to [[Cycle of erosion|Davisian geomorphology]] and by allegedly neglecting the fact that physical laws governing processes are the same across the globe.&lt;ref name=Thomas2004/&gt; In addition some conceptions of climatic geomorphology, like that which holds that chemical weathering is more rapid in tropical climates than in cold climates proved to not be straightforwardly true.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;

Despite having diminished in importance, climatic geomorphology continues to exist as a field of study producing relevant research. More recently, concerns over [[global warming]] have led to a renewed interest in the field.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;

The '''[[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]–[[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] [[association football|football]] rivalry''' is a highly competitive [[sports rivalry]] exists between the national football teams of the two countries, as well as their respective sets of [[Fan (person)|fans]]. Games between the two teams, even those that are only [[friendly match]]es, are often marked by notable and sometimes controversial incidents. These matches are also called "Federal derby."

==Czechoslovakia national football team==
The [[Czechoslovakia national football team]] was the national [[association football]] team of [[Czechoslovakia]] from 1922 to 1993. At the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] at the end of 1992, the team was participating in [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 4|UEFA qualifying Group 4]] for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]]; it completed this campaign under the name '''Representation of Czechs and Slovaks (RCS)'''. The [[Czech Republic national football team]] is recognised by FIFA and UEFA as the successor of the Czechoslovakia team.

The Czechoslovakia team was controlled by the [[Czechoslovak Football Association]]. The team had two runner-up finishes in [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s ([[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]], [[Football World Cup 1962|1962]]) and a [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]] win in [[1976 European Football Championship|1976]]. Czechoslovakia qualified for the final stages of the [[Football World Cup 1990|1990 World Cup]] and shortly afterwards their national coach [[Jozef Venglos]] moved to [[England]] to become [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] manager.

{{BLP sources|date=August 2014}}'''Derek Gregory''' [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D. (Cantab)]] [[British Academy|FBA]], [[Royal Society of Canada|FRSC]] (born 1 March 1951) is a British academic and world-renowned [[geography|geographer]] who is currently Peter Wall Distinguished Professor and Professor of Geography at the [[University of British Columbia]] in [[Vancouver]]. He formerly held positions at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwias.ubc.ca/people/distinguished-professor/derek-gregory.php |title=Derek Gregory - Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies |first= |last= |work=pwias.ubc.ca |year=2013 |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory is best known for his book ''[[The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq]]'', published in 2004. This book discusses the actions of Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom in the [[Middle East]] after [[9/11]]. It reflects how the popular [[discourse]]s found in the [[Mass media|media]] and in political circles indicate a continued [[Orientalism]] and [[colonialism]]. It also draws on the work of political theorist [[Giorgio Agamben]] and in particular his theory of the '[[State of Exception (2005)|state of exception]]'.

Earlier works by Gregory have concentrated on [[political geography|political]], [[cultural geography|cultural]] and [[historical geography]]. He has also contributed to theoretical writing on [[Imagined geographies]] and [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]].  A book published in 1994, ''[[Geographical Imaginations]]'', explores the relations between social theory and place, space and landscape.

He graduated from the University of Cambridge with a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1981. He has honorary doctorates from the University of Heidelberg and Roskilde University, and he was awarded the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 2006.  His current research is on late modern war and on the cultural/political histories and geographies of bombing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4442">'''Detachment''' ([[Old French]] ''de'', from, and ''[at]tach'', joining with a stake) under [[international law]] is the ''formal'', permanent separation of and loss of [[sovereignty]] over some territory to another geo-political entity (either adjacent or non-contiguous). After World War I [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] were a formal detachment from Germany. More often detachment occurs as a process within a country, for example the creation of the Federal [[District of Columbia]] resulted from a detachment of territory from the State of Maryland. The removal of territory from a city or special district is a detachment.&lt;ref name="Alaska"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Detachment from a City Government|publisher=Alaska Division of Community and Regional Affairs|url=http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/logon/muni/muni-citydetach.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624224251/http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/LOGON/muni/muni-citydetach.htm|archivedate=24 June 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Detachment of Territory|publisher=U.S. Legal, Inc.|url=http://municipal.uslegal.com/change-of-status-and-change-of-boundaries/detachment-of-territory/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a country detachment is governed by the laws of the supervening entity.&lt;ref name="Alaska" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Towne, George |year=2003 |title=State Notes: Topics of Legislative Interest: Annexation and Detachment In Michigan |publisher=Senate Fiscal Agency, Michigan State Senate |url=http://www.senate.michigan.gov/sfa/publications%5Cnotes%5C2003notes%5Cnotesmayjun03gt.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HLrma9Pi?url=http://www.senate.michigan.gov/sfa/publications%5Cnotes%5C2003notes%5Cnotesmayjun03gt.pdf |archivedate=13 June 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Detachment can be considered the opposite or reverse of [[annexation]].

The formal detachment of Egypt from the Turkish Empire was a condition for British investment in the Suez Canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lawrence, Thomas Joseph|year=1884|title=The Suez Canal in International Law|journal=The Law Magazine and Review (5th series)|volume=9|pages=117&amp;ndash;143, [https://books.google.com/books?id=b_QwAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA137 page 137]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==League of Nations mandates==
{{Main|League of Nations mandate}}
Following World War I, a number of colonial territories and border territories were detached from Germany, as well as portions of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire and Ottoman Empire being detached. Some of these detachments were incorporated directly into new countries, such as Yugoslavia, or annexed by existing countries such as [[Northern Schleswig]] into Denmark.  But some, particularly in the [[Middle East]] and those of the [[List of former German colonies|German colonies]], were placed under the "protection" of one or another of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied countries]] who won the war, including Germany's concessions in China, [[Kiautschou Bay concession|Kiautschou]] and [[Chefoo#History|Chefoo]]. From a [[rule of law]] standpoint these [[protectorate]]s were not war [[Looting|''booty'']], but "mandates" from a legally constituted international body, so detachment occurred without annexation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Korman, Sharon|year=1996|title=The Right of Conquest: The Acquisition of Territory by Force in International Law and Practice|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ueDO1dJyjrUC&amp;pg=PA142 142]|isbn=978-0-19-828007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Djurgårdsbrunnsviken''' is a [[bay]] in central [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], together with the canal [[Djurgårdsbrunnskanalen]] forming the northern shore line of the island [[Djurgården]] (or more correctly between [[Northern Djurgården|Northern]] and [[Southern Djurgården]]).  The bridge [[Djurgårdsbron]] stretches over the bay.

Historically known as a good fishing ground, Djurgårdsbrunnsviken, also known as the Bay of Sweden, is today popular for bathing in summer.  The bay was used for the [[Diving at the 1912 Summer Olympics|diving]], [[Swimming at the 1912 Summer Olympics|swimming]] (including the part for the [[Modern pentathlon at the 1912 Summer Olympics|modern pentathlon]] event), [[Water polo at the 1912 Summer Olympics|water polo]] and [[Rowing at the 1912 Summer Olympics|rowing]] competitions during the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], and during the Swedish championship 1930.&lt;ref name="Hasselbald" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080410231505/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1912/1912.pdf 1912 Summer Olympics official report.] pp. 211-7, 221-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the north shore of the bay are a great number of embassies and several museums, including The [[Maritime Museum (Stockholm)|National Maritime Museum]] (''[[Sjöhistoriska museet]]''), the [[Museum of Ethnography, Sweden|Ethnographical Museum]] (''[[Museum of Ethnography, Sweden|Etnografiska museet]]''), and the [[Technical Museum]] (''[[Tekniska museet]]'').  On the south shore are the [[open-air museum]] [[Skansen]], the [[Rosendal Palace]] (''[[Rosendals slott]]'').

The '''[[geography]] of [[Kenya]]''' is diverse, varying amongst Kenya's [[Counties of Kenya|47 Counties]]. [[Kenya]] has a coastline on the Indian Ocean, which contains swamps of [[East African mangroves]]. Inland are broad plains and numerous hills.

Central and Western Kenya is characterised by the [[Kenyan Rift Valley]] and central province home to the highest mountain, [[Mount Kenya]] and [[Mount Elgon]] on the border between Kenya and Uganda. The [[Kakamega Forest]] in western Kenya is a relic of an East African rainforest. Much bigger is [[Mau Forest]], the largest forest complex in East Africa.

==Climate==
[[File:Kenya map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Kenya map of Köppen climate classification]]
The climate of Kenya varies by location, from mostly cool every day, to always warm/hot.&lt;ref name=CCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=CCK/&gt;&lt;ref name=CCM/&gt; The climate along the coast is tropical. This means rainfall and temperatures are higher throughout the year. At the coastal cities, Mombasa, Lamu and Malindi, the air changes from cool to hot, almost every day. (''See chart below'').&lt;ref name=CCM/&gt;

The further inside Kenya, the more arid the climate becomes. An arid climate is nearly devoid of rainfall, and temperature swings widely according to the general time of the day/night. For many areas of Kenya, the daytime temperature rises about 12&amp;nbsp;°C (corresponding to a rise of about 22&amp;nbsp;°F), almost every day.&lt;ref name=CCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=CCK/&gt;&lt;ref name=CCM/&gt;

Elevation is the major factor in temperature levels, with the higher areas, on average, as 11&amp;nbsp;°C (20&amp;nbsp;°F) cooler, day or night.&lt;ref name="CCN"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CCM/&gt; The many cities over a kilometre in elevation have temperature swings from roughly {{convert|50|-|79|F|C|order=flip}}. Nairobi, at {{convert|1798|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, ranges from {{convert|49|-|80|F|C|order=flip}},&lt;ref name=CCN/&gt; and [[Kitale]], at {{convert|1825|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, ranges from {{convert|51|-|82|F|C|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name=CCK/&gt; At night, heavy clothes or blankets are needed, in the highlands, when the temperature drops to about {{convert|50|-|54|F|C|order=flip}} every night.

At lower altitudes, the increased temperature is like day and night, literally: like starting the morning at the highland daytime high, and then adding the heat of the day, again. Hence, the overnight low temperatures near sea level are nearly the same as the high temperatures of the elevated Kenyan highlands. However, locations along the Indian Ocean have more moderate temperatures, as a few degrees cooler in the daytime, such as at [[Mombasa]] (''see chart below'').

There are slight seasonal variations in temperature, of {{convert|4|C-change|disp=or}},&lt;ref name=CCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=CCK/&gt;&lt;ref name=CCM/&gt; cooler in the winter months. Although Kenya is centred at the [[equator]], it shares the seasons of the [[southern hemisphere]]: with the warmest summer months in December–March and the coolest winter months in June–August, again with differences in temperature varying by location within the country.&lt;ref name=CCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=CCK/&gt;&lt;ref name=CCM/&gt;

On the high mountains, such as [[Mount Kenya]], [[Mount Elgon]] and [[Kilimanjaro]], the weather can become bitterly cold for most of the year. Some snowfall occurs on the highest mountains.

==Terrain==
[[Image:Kenya Topography.png|thumb|350px|The topography of Kenya.]]
Kenya's terrain is composed of low plains that rise into central highlands that are, in turn, bisected by the [[Great Rift Valley]]. There is also a fertile plateau in the west of the country.

===Elevation extremes===
The lowest point on Kenya is at sea level on the Indian Ocean. The highest point on Kenya is 5,197 meters above sea level at [[Mount Kenya]].

===Rivers===
The three main rivers are the [[Athi-Galana-Sabaki River|Galana]] and the [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana]] and The [[Nzoia River|Nzoia]] River which is a {{convert|257|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} Kenyan river, rising from [[Mount Elgon]]. It flows south and then west, eventually flowing into [[Lake Victoria]] near the town of Port Victoria. However, the [[Ewaso Ng'iro]] is an important river, supplying water from [[Mt. Kenya]] to the eastern and north-eastern part of [[Kenya]].

===Natural resources===
Natural resources that are found in Kenya include: limestone, soda ash, salt, gemstones, fluorspar, zinc, diatomite, oil, gas, gypsum, wildlife and hydropower.

===Land use===
9.8% of the land is arable; permanent crops occupy 0.9% of the land, permanent pasture occupy 37.4% of the land; forest occupies 6.1% of the land. Other uses make up the rest of Kenya's land. This is as of 2011.

1032&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of Kenyan land was irrigated in 2003.

===Total renewable water resources===
30.7&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (2011)

===Freshwater withdrawal===
* Total: 2.74&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/yr (17%/4%/79%)
* Per capita: 72.96 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/yr (2003)

==Natural hazards==
Natural hazards include recurring drought and flooding during the rainy seasons.

There is limited volcanic activity in the country. [[Barrier Volcano]] (elev. 1,032 m) last erupted in 1921. Several others have been historically active (see [[List of volcanoes in Kenya]]).

===Environmental issues===
{{main|Environmental issues in Kenya}}

====Current issues====

Current issues that threaten the environment at the moment include water pollution from urban and industrial wastes; degradation of water quality from the increased use of pesticides and fertilisers; [[deforestation]]; [[water hyacinth]] infestation in [[Lake Victoria]]; [[soil erosion]]; [[desertification]]; and poaching.

====International agreements====
* Party to: [[Biodiversity]], [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Kyoto Protocol|Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol]], [[Desertification]], [[Endangered Species]], [[Hazardous Wastes]], [[Law of the Sea]], [[Marine Dumping]], [[Marine Life Conservation]], [[Ozone Layer Protection]], Ship Pollution ([[MARPOL 73/78]]), [[Wetlands]], [[Whaling]].

== Extreme points ==

This is a list of the extreme points of [[Kenya]], the points that are further north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northernmost point – [[Kalukwakerith]] Mountain, [[Turkana County]]
* Easternmost point – the [[tripoint]] with [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]], [[Mandera County]]
* Southernmost point – the point where the border with [[Tanzania]] enters the Indian Ocean, [[Kwale County]]
* Westernmost point – unnamed land west of [[Port Victoria, Kenya|Port Victoria]], [[Busia County]]
** ''Note: Kalukwakerith Mountain is in the disputed [[Ilemi Triangle]] region. If this area is excluded then Kenya does not have a northernmost point, the northern border being a straight line.''

[[North America]] is the third largest [[continent]], and is also a portion of the second largest [[supercontinent]] if North and [[South America]] are combined into the [[Americas]] and [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]] are considered to be part of one supercontinent called [[Afro-Eurasia]].

With an estimated population of 460 million and an area of 24,346,000&amp;nbsp;km² (9,400,000&amp;nbsp;mi²), the northernmost of the two continents of the [[Western Hemisphere]]&lt;ref name="def"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geographicguide.com/north-america.htm|title=Geographic Guide - Images of North America|accessdate=2006-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is bounded by the [[Pacific Ocean]] on the west; the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on the east; the [[Caribbean Sea]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific ocean]]s, and [[South America]] on the south; and the [[Arctic Ocean]] on the north.

The northern half of [[North America]] is sparsely populated and covered mostly by [[Canada]], except for the northeastern portion, which is occupied by [[Greenland]], and the northwestern portion, which is occupied by [[Alaska]], the largest [[U.S. state|state of the U.S.]] The central and southern portions of the continent are represented by the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], and numerous smaller states primarily in [[Central America]] and in the [[Caribbean]].

The continent is delimited on the southeast by most geographers at the [[Darién Gap|Darién watershed]] along the [[Colombia]]-[[Panama]] border, placing all of Panama within North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#americas "Americas"] ''Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49)'', United Nations Statistics Division&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/international/north_america/referencemap_image_view "North America"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021000000/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/international/north_america/referencemap_image_view |date=October 21, 2006 }} ''Atlas of Canada''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="North America Atlas"&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=nameri&amp;Rootmap=&amp;Mode=d&amp;SubMode=w North America Atlas] National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, a less common view would end North America at the man-made [[Panama Canal]].  Islands generally associated with North America include [[Greenland]], the world's largest island, and [[archipelago]]s and islands in the Caribbean. The [[Americas (terminology)|terminology of the Americas]] is complex, but  "[[Anglo-America]]" can describe Canada and the U.S., while "[[Latin America]]" comprises Mexico and the countries of [[Central America]] and the Caribbean, as well as the entire continent of South America.

Natural features of North America include the northern portion of the [[American Cordillera]], represented by the [[geology|geologically]] new [[Rocky Mountains]] in the west; and the considerably older [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the east. The north hosts an abundance of [[glacial lake]]s formed during the [[last glacial period]], including the [[Great Lakes]]. North America's major [[continental divide]] is the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Great Divide]], which runs north and south down through Rocky Mountains. The major [[drainage basin|watershed]]s all drain to the east: The [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]/[[Missouri River|Missouri]] and [[Rio Grande]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] into the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

[[Climate]] is determined to a large extent by the [[latitude]], ranging from [[Arctic]] cold in the north to tropical heat in the south. The western half of North America tends to have milder and wetter climate than other areas with equivalent latitude, although there are [[steppe]]s (known as "[[prairies]]") in the central and western portions, and [[desert]]s in the [[Southwestern United States]] of [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Utah]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Texas]]; along with the Mexican states of [[Baja California]], [[Baja California Sur]], [[Sonora]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo Leon]] and [[Tamaulipas]].

The [[continental crust]] started to form 4 billion years ago ([[Gigaannum|Ga]]), and six of the [[microcontinent]]s collided to form the craton about 2 Ga. This core has been enlarged by [[plate tectonics]], most notably between 1.8 and 1.65 Ga when a piece currently stretching from [[Arizona]] to [[Missouri]] fused with the south and west portion of the craton. The craton started to [[rift]] about 1.1 Ga, and the fissure (now the [[Midcontinent Rift System]]) ran between [[Kansas]] and [[Lake Superior]] before stopping, perhaps due to the [[Grenville orogeny|Grenville collision]] in the east.

Roughly 3 million years ago ([[Megaannum|Ma]]), the [[volcano|volcanic]] [[Isthmus of Panama]] formed between the North and [[South American]] continents creating a bridge over what was the [[Central American Seaway]] and allowing the migration of flora and fauna between the two landmasses in the [[Great American Interchange]]. Starting 2.58 Ma, the [[Quaternary glaciation]] covered much of the continent with ice, centered west of Hudson Bay, the floor of which is slowly rebounding after being depressed by the great weight of the ice. Glaciers descended the slopes of the Rocky Mountains and those of the [[Pacific Margin]]. Extensive glacial lakes, such as [[Glacial Lake Missoula]], [[Bonneville Salt Flats|Bonneville]], [[Lake Lahontan|Lahontan]], [[Lake Agassiz|Agassiz]], and [[Glacial Lake Algonquin|Algonquin]], formed by glacial melt water.

==Physiography==
North America may be divided into at least five major [[physiographic regions of the world|physiographic regions]]:{{Citation needed|reason=WHO SUBDIVIDES THE CONTINENT IN THIS MANNER?  ALSO, A MAP IS NEEDED FOR THIS TAXONOMY.|date=April 2009}}
;[[Canadian Shield]]: This is a geologically stable area of rock dating between 2.5 and 4 [[Gya]] that occupies most of the northeastern quadrant, including [[Greenland]].

;[[Appalachian Mountains]]: The Appalachians are an old and eroded system that formed about 300 Ma and extends from the [[Gaspé Peninsula]] to [[Alabama]].

;[[Atlantic Coastal Plain]]: The plain is a belt of lowlands widening to the south that extends from south [[New England]] to Mexico.

;Interior Lowlands: The lowlands extend down the middle of the continent from the [[Mackenzie Valley]] to the Atlantic Coastal Plain, and include the [[Great Plains]] on the west and the agriculturally productive [[Interior Plains]] on the east.

;North [[American Cordillera]]: The cordillera is a complex belt of mountains and associated [[plateau]]s and [[Depression (geology)|basins]] some of which were formed as recently as 100&amp;ndash;65 Ma, during the Cretaceous. The cordillera extend from Alaska into Mexico and includes two [[orogeny|orogenic belts]] — the Pacific Margin on the west and the Rocky Mountains on the east — separated by a system of intermontane plateaus and basins.&lt;ref name="ghi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0860021.html |title=North America's Geology and Geography |accessdate=2006-08-19 |last=Jones |first=Steve |publisher=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coastal Plain and the main belts of the North American Cordillera continue in the south in Mexico (where the [[Mexican Plateau]], bordered by the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] and the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]], is considered a continuation of the intermontane system) to connect the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt|Transverse Volcanic Range]], a zone of high and active volcanic peaks south of Mexico City.

The vast majority of North America is located on the [[North American Plate]], centered on the [[Laurentia]] craton. Parts of California and western Mexico form the partial edge of the [[Pacific Plate]]; the two plates meet along the [[San Andreas Fault]]. The southern portion of the Caribbean and parts of Central America compose the much smaller [[Caribbean Plate]].

The western mountains have split in the middle, into the main range of the Rockies and the Coast Ranges in California, [[Oregon]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and [[British Columbia]] with the [[Great Basin]] (a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts) in between. The highest peak is [[Mount McKinley|Mount McKinley/Denali]] in Alaska.  The geographic center of North America is approximately "''6 miles west of [[Balta, North Dakota|Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota]]''" at 48⁰ 10′north, 100⁰ 10′west,&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html |title=Elevations and Distances in the United States |format=Online Edition |year=1995 |accessdate=2009-02-05 |quote=''No marked or monumented point has been established by any government agency as the geographic center of the 50 States, the [[contiguous United States|conterminous United States]], or the North American continent.'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722022527/http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html |archivedate=July 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 15-foot (4.5 m) field stone obelisk in [[Rugby, North Dakota]] (~15&amp;nbsp;miles or 25&amp;nbsp;km away) claims to mark the center.{{Citation needed|reason=A QUOTATION FROM THE MARKER IS NEEDED|date=February 2009}}

Three countries (Canada, the United States, and Mexico) make up most of North America's land mass; they share the continent with 34 other island countries in the Caribbean and [[Central America|south of Mexico]].

==Surface and climate==
[[File:Map of Great Plains.svg|thumb|The Great Plains]]

The [[Great Plains]] is the broad expanse of [[prairie]] and [[steppe]] which lies east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The narrow plains in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] coast and the [[savannas]] of the Mississippi are analogous to, respectively, the [[Patagonian steppes]] and the pampas of the Piranha, Paraguay, and Rio de la Plata. Thus the Appalachians and the mountain chains of Brazil are regarded as creating similar interruptions to the plains community.&lt;ref name="jkl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0860022.html|title=North America climate|accessdate=2006-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North America extends to within 10° of [[latitude]] of both the [[equator]] and the [[North Pole]]. It embraces every climatic zone, from tropical rain forest and savanna on the lowlands of Central America to areas of permanent ice cap in central Greenland.&lt;ref name="jkl"/&gt; [[Subarctic]] and [[tundra]] climates prevail in north Canada and north Alaska, and desert and semiarid conditions are found in interior regions cut off by high mountains from rain-bearing westerly winds.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; However, most of the continent has temperate climates very favorable to settlement and agriculture. Prairies, or vast grasslands cover a huge amount in mountain ranges.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

== Deserts==
[[File:North America map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|North America map of Köppen climate classification.]]
The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run along the entire [[Pacific Coast]], acting as a barrier to the humid winds that sweep in from the ocean. The rising topography forces this air upwards, causing moisture to condense and fall in the form of [[rain]] on the western slopes of the [[mountain]]s, with some areas receiving more than {{convert|70|in|m}} of rainfall per year. As a result, the [[air]] has lost much of its moisture and becomes hot and dry when it reaches the areas east of the coastal mountain ranges.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; These arid conditions are, in some instances, exacerbated in regions of extremely low altitude (some near or below sea level) by higher air pressure, resulting in drier conditions and '''adiabatic''' heating effects, some of these pocket deserts exist in valleys well north of the Canada–US border in interior British Columbia.  What precipitation does fall generally does not last long, lost primarily to evaporation, as well as rapid runoff and efficient water uptake and storage by native vegetation.

===Climate and vegetation===

There are various plant life distributions in North America. Plant life in the Arctic includes grasses, mosses, and Arctic willows. Coniferous trees, including [[spruce]]s, [[pine]]s, [[Tsuga|hemlock]]s, and [[fir]]s, are indigenous to the [[Canada|Canadian]] and Western U.S. mountain ranges as far south as [[San Francisco]]. Among these are giant [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|sequoias]], [[Cupressaceae|redwood]]s, great [[fir]]s, and [[sugar pine]]s. Sugar pines are generally confined to the [[Pacific Northwest|northwestern]] area of the [[United States]].
The central region of the country has [[hardwoods]]. Southern [[U.S. state|states]] grow extensive yellow pines. In addition, mahogany, logwood, and lignumvitae - all tropical in nature - are grown. The southwest has desert plants, including [[yucca|yucci]] and [[cacti]]. The cultivated native plants of North America are [[tobacco]], [[maize]], [[potato]], [[vanilla]], [[melon]]s, [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[gourd]]s, [[indigo plant]], and [[bean]].

==Zoology==
North America is home to many native mammal species.  Several species of [[deer]], including elk, caribou, moose, mule deer, and the abundant white-tailed deer are found throughout various regions, along with the [[bison]] and [[musk ox]] in the central and northern plains, respectively.  Three species of bear, several subspecies of [[wolf]], and various other carnivores such as raccoons, skunks, and [[cat]]s including cougars and lynxes are widely distributed.  The family [[Mustelidae]] is well represented, including badgers, otters, ferrets, and wolverines.  Numerous species of squirrels and other [[rodents]], such as beavers and muskrats, can be found in virtually every region of the continent.   Central America has adapted [[sloth]]s, [[anteater]]s, and [[armadillo]]s. Other animals includes the [[condor]], among the heights of the Andes, the [[parrots]] and the [[monkeys]] of Tropical forests, the [[humming bird]], [[rattlesnake]], [[alligator]], and Cayman of the banks of the streams, and swarms of mosquitoes on the wide plains.

==Mining and petroleum==
The [[mining]] and [[petroleum]] industries are important in [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]]. These [[natural resource]]s make the region one of the richest on the earth.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt;&lt;ref name="def" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pqr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/world/A0860024.html|title=Fact Monster - North America: Resources and Economy |accessdate=2006-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rocky Mountains===
[[File:Colorado rocky mtns.JPG|thumb|right|Picture of Rocky Mountains]]
The Rocky Mountain region is known for vast resources and rich mineral deposits including [[copper]], [[lead]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[tungsten]], [[uranium]], and [[zinc]]. [[Coal]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] are mineral fuels found.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pqr"/&gt; Old mine tailings are present in the Rocky Mountain landscape.

==Agriculture and forestry==
Agriculture and forestry are two major industries. Agriculture includes arid land and irrigated farming and livestock grazing.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt;  Livestock are often moved between high-elevation summer pastures and low-elevation and winter pastures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8848">The '''geology of [[Saudi Arabia]]''' includes Precambrian igneous and metamorphic basement rocks exposed across much of the country. Thick sedimentary sequences from the [[Phanerozoic]] including sandstone, anhydrite, dolomite, limestone, chert and marl dominate much of the country's surface and host oil. 

==Geologic History, Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics==
Saudi Arabia is underlain by the [[Precambrian]] igneous and metamorphic rocks of the [[Proterozoic]] Arabian Craton. Up to 5.5 kilometers of sedimentary rocks from the [[Cambrian]] through the [[Pliocene]] accumulated on the shield, including many oil bearing units. 

Within these younger rocks, a large western facing escarpment formed in central Saudi Arabia, capped with limestone. Basement rock dips away from the escarpment with thicker sediments in the Rub al Khali and the Persian Gulf region. {&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Powers et. al.|year=1963|title=Geology of the Arabian Peninsula: Sedimentary Geology of Saudi Arabia|publisher=USGS|p=D1-D2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{sfn| Powers et. al.|1963|p=D1-D2}}

===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
Two kilometers of [[Paleozoic]] rocks are exposed in the northwest, with lowest 600 meters of correlated with the [[Cambrian]] in Jordan. The top 300 meters is limestone although most units from the [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]] are terrestrial sandstone or shale. 

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
The [[Triassic]] begins with the Khuff Formation shallow water limestone and ascends through 500 meters of Jurassic shelf limestone and marine shale, overlain by fossil-rich rocks from the late Jurassic and early [[Cretaceous]]. Jurassic rocks form much of the escarpment in central Saudi Arabia, although discontinuous sedimentation led to the deposition of [[calcarenite]] and [[anhydrite]]. The alternating layers of the Arab Formation took shape during the time and holds extensive oil and gas resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.searchanddiscovery.com/pdfz/documents/cantrell/images/Cantrell.pdf.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104170143/http://www.searchanddiscovery.com/pdfz/documents/cantrell/images/Cantrell.pdf.html# |archive-date=2018-11-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0037073805003854 | doi=10.1016/j.sedgeo.2005.11.015| title=Cortical fabrics of Upper Jurassic ooids, Arab Formation, Saudi Arabia: Implications for original carbonate mineralogy| journal=Sedimentary Geology| volume=186| issue=3–4| pages=157–170| year=2006| last1=Cantrell| first1=Dave L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://miami.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/genesis-and-characterization-of-dolomite-arab-d-reservoir-ghawar- | title=Genesis and characterization of dolomite, Arab-D reservoir, Ghawar field, Saudi Arabia| journal=Geoarabia| volume=9| issue=2| pages=11–36| year=2004| last1=Hagerty| first1=Royal| last2=Swart| first2=Peter| last3=Cantrell| first3=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kimmeridgian]] age Jubaila Limestone contains the high productivity Arab-D member in the Ghawar oil field and a 1.1 kilometer sequence of aphanitic and calcarenite  limestone.

For the most part, Middle Cretaceous rocks include thick sandstone, although some marine rocks are present to the north and Jordan. A combined sequence of 500 meters of limestone and dolomite spans the Cretaceous into the Paleogene. {{sfn| Powers et. al.|1963|p=D1-D2}}

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
The Umm er Rhaduma Formation, named by S.B. Henry and C.W. Brown in 1935 is the oldest [[Cenozoic]] sedimentary unit in Saudi Arabia, from the [[Paleocene]] to the early [[Eocene]]. It is visible in the walls of Wadi al Batin and overlies the dolomite and limestone of the Aruma Formation. The formation spans 1200 kilometers from Wadi Jabaliyah to the Iraq-Saudi Arabia border. [[Karst]] commonly forms in the uplands along with river channels. Northwest of Al Batin, the rock has very poor internal drainage. Drilling revealed two monocline structures were related to the dissolution and collapse of anhydrite layers. Dolomite, limestone and chert with some fossiliferous units are particularly common. Dissolved hydrogen gas renders water from the unit poor quality near Ras Tenura, Abqaiq and Nariya. [[Saudi Aramco]] developed the unit to supply water to its outlying operations. {{sfn| Powers et. al.|1963|p=D84-D86}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://qjegh.lyellcollection.org/content/15/2/105|title=Hydrogeology of the Umm Er Radhuma aquifer, Saudi Arabia, with reference to fossil gradients|first1=W.|last1=Bakiewicz|first2=D. M.|last2=Milne|first3=M.|last3=Noori|date=1 May 1982|publisher=|journal=Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology|volume=15|issue=2|pages=105–126|accessdate=4 November 2018|via=qjegh.lyellcollection.org|doi=10.1144/GSL.QJEG.1982.015.02.03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit formation is overlain by the early Eocene Rus Formation, named for Umm ar Ru'us. Originally known as the Chalky Zone, it was renamed in 1946. It occurs only a few places, extending 180 kilometers north of Wadi as Sahba and occupying the breached center of the Dammam Dome. Chalk and limestone ascend to gypsum-bearing and calcareous shale. Coastal Saudi Arabia was only submerged briefly in the Cenozoic, limiting marine deposition, although the few Miocene and Pliocene marine rock are divided into the Dam, Hofuf and Hadrukh formations. {{sfn| Powers et. al.|1963|p=D87-D92}}

The early and middle Eocene Damman Formation is named for the Dammam Dome and includes basal marl, limestone and dolomite as well as the Saila Shale Member. It is exposed above the Umm er Rhaduma but largely overlapped by [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] sediments and occurs in larger areas near the border with Qatar and in a five kilometer wide, 180 kilometer long belt from Wadi as Sahba. The marl, limestone and shale units taken together do store groundwater and communities in the Eastern Province often draw on the Alat aquifer in the Khobar Member. 

Groundwater conditions vary widely within Cenozoic units. Al Hasa and Al Qatif are examples of oases, fed by artesian wells. Al Fufuf has a well-developed Miocene-Pliocene aquifer, likely fed in part by an underlying Eocene aquifer. Neogene groundwater supplies other scattered locations in the Eastern Province. [[Paleogene]] gravels form patches in the Wadi Nayyal and Wadi as Sahba. The round quartz pebbles can reach 10 centimeters in diameter, often accompanied by limestone pebbles. In the past, a river may have crossed the Al Aramah escarpment via the Wadi as Sahba structural trench. At the northwest edge of Harrat Hutaym are marl, sandstone and basal conglomerate deposits with [[ostracode]] fossils from a freshwater environment, inferred to be from the Pliocene. Small, similar deposits are scattered across the Rub al Khali. 

The Al Harrah volcanic complex is the only eruptive feature in the sediment-covered areas of Saudi Arabia. Its olivine basalt and [[aplite]] dikes formed during the Miocene, Pliocene and early Quaternary, spanning 250 kilometers to the northwest from Ath Thayat into Jordan. In the northwest, duricrust carapace is particularly common on Paleozoic and Mesozoic units due to greater moisture. {{sfn| Powers et. al.|1963|p=D98-D99}}

In the last 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]], limestone-quartz terrace gravel deposited in Wadi al Batin, , occurring 60 to 90 kilometers north of the Trans-Arabian Pipeline. Sheet gravel blankets the Ad Dibdibah Plain, with quartz, carbonate and metamorphic rock grains spanning into Iraq and Kuwait. Al Harrah lava field basalt pebbles make up most of the gravel in the As Sahn Plain. Deltaic sheet gravels are also common in Wadi as Sahba-Wadi and Dawasir-Wadi Najran. In the Al Aramah and Hit escarpment are dissected, older limestone gravels. An Nafud and Ar Rub al Khali have silt, gravel, sabkha, unconsolidated sands and coral limestone from the geologically recent past. Half of Saudi Arabia with sedimentary cover is blanketed in eolian sands, covering an area of 600,000 square kilometers. Lake beds outcrop in the Rub al Khali while marine terraces are common along the Persian Gulf. {{sfn| Powers et. al.|1963|p=D99-D100}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6594">The '''Global Scenario Group''' (GSG) was an international, interdisciplinary body convened in 1995 by the [[Tellus Institute]] and the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] (SEI) to develop scenarios for world development in the twenty-first century. Further development of the Great Transition scenarios has been carried on by the [[Great Transition Initiative]] (GTI). 

The GSG's underlying scenario development work was rooted in the long-range integrated [[scenario analysis]] that Tellus Institute and Stockholm Environment Institute had undertaken through the [[PoleStar Project]] and its PoleStar System.  Initially conceived in 1991 as a tool for integrated sustainability planning and long-range scenario analysis, the PoleStar System was inspired by the 1987 [[Brundtland Commission]] report ''[[Our Common Future]]'', which first put the concept of [[sustainable development]] on the international agenda.

The work of the Global Scenario Group was widely adopted in high-level intergovernmental settings.  The scenarios informed numerous international assessments, including the [[World Water Council]]'s World Water Vision report in 1999–2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Water Council - Vision Report Chapter 3|url=http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/fileadmin/world_water_council/documents_old/Library/WWVision/Chapter3.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2013|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; the OECD Environmental Outlook in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Highlights of the OECD Environmental Outlook|url=http://www.oecd.org/environment/indicators-modelling-outlooks/1863523.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2013|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s greenhouse gas emission mitigation assessment in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Third Assessment Report - Climate Change 2001 - Working Group III: Mitigation|url=http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]'s Third GEO Report in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Environment Outlook Scenario Framework: Background Paper for UNEP's Third Global Environment Outlook Report|url=http://www.unep.org/geo/GEO3/pdfs/GEO_ScenarioFramework.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: A Framework for Assessment - Chapter 7|url=http://www.unep.org/maweb/documents/document.305.aspx.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2013|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Several of the GSG participants who actively participated in the IPCC assessments have been recognized for contributing to the 2007 award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the IPCC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/contents.html Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenarios==
In 2002, the GSG formally summarized their scenario approach in an essay called ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Raskin, Tariq Banuri, Gilberto Gallopín, Pablo Gutman, Al Hammond, Robert Kates, and Rob Swart, ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead'' (Boston: Stockholm Environment Institute, 2002), http://www.greattransition.org/gt-essay. See also its sequel: Paul Raskin, ''Journey to Earthland: The Great Transition to Planetary Civilization''. Boston: Tellus Institute, 2016, http://www.greattransition.org/publication/journey-to-earthland.&lt;/ref&gt; The essay argues that history has entered a qualitatively new era of high global interdependence, which they refer to as the [[planetary phase of civilization]]. Some kind of global society will take shape in this century, but its form remains deeply uncertain and highly contested. Three classes of scenarios are discussed – Conventional Worlds, Barbarization, and Great Transitions.

===Conventional Worlds===

Conventional Worlds scenarios envision a future which unfolds without major surprises and with essential continuity with current trends, driving forces, and dominant values.  ''Market Forces'' versions rely heavily on free markets that generate sufficient and timely technological evolution to address emerging environmental and social challenges. ''Policy Reform'' versions assume instead that governments mobilize to mount a coordinated, sustained, and effective regime of policy adjustments to mitigate environmental disasters and social destabilization.

===Barbarization===

Barbarization scenarios depict futures in which the market and policy adjustments of Conventional Worlds are inadequate to address such problems as climate change and social polarization, leading to a devolution of civilized norms. In ''Fortress World'' variants, powerful global actors respond to impending collapse by mounting an authoritarian intervention to stem environmental degradation and social conflict. International elites retreat to protected enclaves, where they manage remaining natural resources and protect their interests. Outside these enclaves, the remainder of civilization endures poverty and degradation. ''Breakdown'' variants would ensue if the elite are unable to form a coherent, adequate response to the mounting crisis. The world descends into conflict and degradation, as institutions collapse.

===The Great Transition===

[[Great Transition]] scenarios go beyond the market and policy adjustments of Conventional Worlds to envision a fundamental shift in institutions and values. The growth imperative of Conventional Worlds economies give way to [[steady state]] economies, the tendency toward inequality is countered by egalitarian social policies, and human values turn toward solidarity, well-being, and ecology, rather than individualism, consumerism, and domination of nature. The potential of a Great Transition is linked to the emergence of a [[global citizens movement]] to advocate for new values to underpin global society.

''[[Eco-communalism]]'' variants are characterized by extreme localism, while the ''New Sustainability Paradigm'' alternative welcomes cosmopolitanism and global governance in a plural world.  In all versions, civilization has a far smaller [[ecological footprint]], societies are more equitable, and citizens have more leisure time to pursue fulfilling activities.

'''gpsd''' is a [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]] that receives data from a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receiver, and provides the data back to multiple applications such as [[Kismet (software)|Kismet]] or [[GPS navigation software]]. 
It thus provides a unified [[Interface (computing)|interface]] to receivers of different types, and allows concurrent access by multiple applications.

It is commonly used on [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=gpsd Debian packages of gpsd]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/gpsd Fedora package of gpsd] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002061218/https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/gpsd |date=2011-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebsdsoftware.org/astro/gpsd.html gpsd FreeBSD] from the [[FreeBSD]] ports archive&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed under the [[BSD licenses#3-clause|3-clause BSD license]], gpsd is [[free software]].

== Design ==
gpsd provides a [[TCP/IP]] service by binding to port 2947.&lt;ref name="gpsd_man"&gt;[http://gpsd.berlios.de/gpsd.html gpsd manual page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718125612/http://gpsd.berlios.de/gpsd.html |date=2011-07-18 }} gpsd project, retrieved 2011-07-11&lt;/ref&gt; It accepts commands from that socket, and returns results back to it. These commands use a [[JSON]]-based syntax and return JSON responses&lt;ref name="gpsd_man"/&gt; (older, now obsolete versions used single-letter commands). Multiple clients can use gpsd's service in parallel, thus allowing multiple applications to use the data in parallel.

Most GPS receivers are supported, whether [[Serial communications|serial]], [[USB]], or [[Bluetooth]]. Starting in 2009, GPSD supports [[Automatic Identification System|AIS]] receivers as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gpsd.berlios.de/history.html A Brief History of GPSD, "In July and August 2009 ESR redesigned the GPSD command protocol and gave gpsd the ability to read data from marine AIS receivers and pass it to clients."; retrieved 2011-05-01] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014054342/http://gpsd.berlios.de/history.html |date=2006-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally gpsd supports interfacing with the UNIX network time protocol daemon [[ntpd]] via [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]] to enable setting the host platform's time via the GPS clock.

== Authors ==
gpsd was originally written by Remco Treffkorn with Derrick Brashear, then maintained by [[Russ Nelson|Russell Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pygps.org/gpsd/CHANGELOG GPSD CHANGELOG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928120501/http://pygps.org/gpsd/CHANGELOG |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now maintained by [[Eric S. Raymond]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gpsd.berlios.de/history.html GPSD History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014054342/http://gpsd.berlios.de/history.html |date=2006-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Bad-Code-Offsets-Open-Web-Innovation.aspx Bad Code Offsets: Open Web Innovation]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flora OR - aerial.jpg|thumb|right|The small town of [[Flora, Oregon]] in the United States is unincorporated, but is considered a populated place.]]
[[File:Taos Pueblo2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.13|[[Taos Pueblo]], an ancient [[pueblo]] belonging to a [[Taos language|Taos]]-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe of [[Pueblo people]]. It is approximately 1000 years old and lies about 1 mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) north of the modern city of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], [[New Mexico]].]]
In [[geography]], [[statistics]] and [[archaeology]], a '''settlement''', '''locality''' or '''populated place''' is a [[community]] in which people live. The complexity of a settlement can range from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding [[Urban area|urbanized areas]]. Settlements may include [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s, [[village]]s, [[town]]s and [[city|cities]].  A settlement may have known historical properties such as the date or era in which it was first settled, or first settled by  particular people.

In the field of [[geospatial predictive modeling]], settlements are "a city, town, village or other agglomeration of buildings where people live and work".&lt;ref name=Semantics&gt;{{cite book |title= GeoSpatial Semantics: 4th International Conference, GeoS 2011, Brest, France |url= http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00001928/01/062.pdf |chapter= A Facet-Based Methodology for Geo-Spatial Modeling |last= Dutta |first= Biswanath |author2=Fausto Giunchiglia |author3=Vincenzo Maltese |year= 2010 |page= 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A settlement conventionally includes its constructed facilities such as [[road]]s, [[enclosure]]s, [[field systems]], [[Boundaries in landscape history|boundary]] banks and [[ditch]]es, [[pond]]s, [[park]]s and [[wood]]s, [[windmill|wind]] and [[water mill]]s, [[manor house]]s, [[moat]]s and [[church (building)|church]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/msrg/msrgpolicy.htm  Medieval Settlement Research Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest remains that have been found of constructed dwellings are remains of huts that were made of mud and branches around 17,000&amp;nbsp;BC at the [[Ohalo]] site (now underwater) near the edge of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. The [[Natufian]]s built houses, also in the [[Levant]], around 10,000&amp;nbsp;BC. Remains of settlements such as [[village]]s become much more common after the invention of agriculture.

== In landscape history ==
[[File:Eoste Keldrimägi.JPG|thumb|Some settlement sites may go out of use. This location in [[Estonia]] was used for human settlement in 2nd half of first millennium and it is considered an [[archaeological record]], that may provide information on how people lived back then.]]
[[Landscape history]] studies the form (morphology) of settlements – for example whether they are [[dispersed settlement|dispersed]] or [[nucleated village|nucleated]]. [[Urban morphology]] can thus be considered a special type of cultural-historical landscape studies. Settlements can be ordered by size, centrality or other factors to define a [[settlement hierarchy]].

== Statistics ==

=== Australia ===
[[Geoscience Australia]] defines a populated place as "a named settlement with a population of 200 or more persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ga.gov.au/mapspecs/250k100k/appendixA_files/Habitation.jsp#Habitation%20Populated%20Place%20Point |title= NTMS Specifications (250K &amp; 100K): Populated place |publisher= [[Australian Government]] |accessdate= July 26, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110603115645/http://www.ga.gov.au/mapspecs/250k100k/appendixA_files/Habitation.jsp#Habitation%20Populated%20Place%20Point |archive-date= June 3, 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee for Geographical Names in Australasia]] used the term [[Suburbs and localities (Australia)|localities]] for rural areas, while the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] uses the term "urban centres/localities" for urban areas.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The [[Agency for Statistics in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] uses the term "populated place" for rural, and "municipality" and  "town" for urban areas.

=== Bulgaria ===
The Bulgarian Government publishes a National Register of Populated places (NRPP).

=== Canada ===
The Canadian government uses the term "populated place" in the ''[[Atlas of Canada]]'', but does not define it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/glossary/results.html?term= |title=Glossary Search Results |work=[[Atlas of Canada]] |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006185826/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/glossary/results.html?term= |archivedate=October 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Statistics Canada]] uses the term [[Census geographic units of Canada#Localities|localities]] for historical named locations.

=== Croatia ===
The [[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]] records population in units called [[settlement (Croatia)|settlements (''naselja'')]].

=== India ===
The Census Commission of [[India]] has a special definition of [[census town]]s.

=== Ireland ===
The  [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]] has a special definition of [[census town]]s.

=== Russia ===
There are various [[types of inhabited localities in Russia]].

=== Sweden ===
[[Statistics Sweden]] uses the term [[Urban areas in Sweden|localities (''tätort'')]] for various densely populated places. The common English-language translation is ''urban areas''.

=== United Kingdom ===
The UK [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] uses the term "urban settlement" to denote an [[urban area]] when analysing census information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/urbansettlement2001 Urban Settlement 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Registrar General for Scotland]] defines settlements as groups of one or more contiguous localities, which are determined according to [[population density]] and [[postcode]] areas. The Scottish settlements are used as one of several factors defining urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/the-census/key-stats-setloc-txt.pdf Scottish census information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218162030/http://gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/the-census/key-stats-setloc-txt.pdf |date=2010-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) has a [[Geographic Names Information System]] that defines three classes of human settlement:
# '''Populated place''' − [[Location (geography)|place]] or [[Area (country subdivision)|area]] with clustered or scattered [[building]]s and a permanent human [[population]] (city, settlement, town, village).  A populated place is usually not [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] and by definition has no legal boundaries. However, a populated place may have a corresponding "civil" record, the legal boundaries of which may or may not coincide with the perceived populated place.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:8:3692675055014428 |title= Feature Class Definitions |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate= July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Census''' − a statistical area delineated locally specifically for the tabulation of Census Bureau data (census designated place, census county division, unorganized territory, various types of American Indian/Alaska Native statistical areas).&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;
# '''Civil''' − a political division formed for administrative purposes ([[borough]], [[county]], [[Place (United States Census Bureau)|incorporated place]], [[municipio]], [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parish]], [[town]], [[township]])."&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

Populated places may be specifically defined in the context of [[census]]es and be different from general-purpose administrative entities, such as [[Place (United States Census Bureau)|"place" as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau]] or [[census-designated place]]s.

== Geospatial modeling ==
In the field of [[geospatial predictive modeling]], settlements are "a city, town, village, or other agglomeration of buildings where people live and work".&lt;ref name=Semantics&gt;{{cite book |title= GeoSpatial Semantics: 4th International Conference, GeoS 2011, Brest, France |url= http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00001928/01/062.pdf |chapter= A Facet-Based Methodology for Geo-Spatial Modeling |last= Dutta |first= Biswanath |author2=Fausto Giunchiglia |author3=Vincenzo Maltese |year= 2010 |page= 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Human Settlement Layer ([http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ GHSL]) framework produces global spatial information about the human presence on the planet over time. This in the form of built up maps, population density maps and settlement maps. This information is generated with evidence-based analytics and knowledge using new spatial data mining technologies. The framework uses heterogeneous data including global archives of fine-scale satellite imagery, census data, and volunteered geographic information. The data is processed fully automatically and generates analytics and knowledge reporting objectively and systematically about the presence of population and built-up infrastructures. The [http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ GHSL] operates in an open and free data and methods access policy (open input, open method, open output).

== Abandoned populated places ==
{{Main|Abandoned village|Ghost town}}
[[File:Namibie Kolmanskop 05.JPG|thumb|right|Abandoned buildings in [[Kolmanskop]], [[Namibia]]&lt;ref name="MapAtlas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mapatlas.org/Namibia/Abandoned_Populated_Place/Kolmanskop/3794/road_and_satellite_map |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415082058/http://en.mapatlas.org/Namibia/Abandoned_Populated_Place/Kolmanskop/3794/road_and_satellite_map |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 15, 2013 |title=Maps of Kolmanskop – Namibia 2012 |year=2012 |work=Map Atlas – Google Maps based atlas of the world |publisher=MapAtlas.org |accessdate=February 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The term "Abandoned populated places" is a ''Feature Designation Name'' in databases sourced by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]&lt;ref name="NGA Geonames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geonames.nga.mil/ggmagaz/feadesgsearchhtml.asp |title=Feature Designation Code Lookup |work=NGA: Geonames Search – OGC Viewer |publisher=[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] |location=Springfield, VA, USA |accessdate=February 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102121347/http://geonames.nga.mil/ggmagaz/feadesgsearchhtml.asp |archivedate=January 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GeoNames]].&lt;ref name="GeoNames"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geonames.org/export/codes.html#P.PPLQ |title=GeoNames Feature Codes |date=February 10, 2012 |work=GeoNames |publisher=[[GeoNames]]|accessdate=February 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Populated places can be abandoned.  Sometimes the structures are still easily accessible, such as in a [[ghost town]], and these may become tourist attractions. Some places that have the appearance of a ghost town, however, may still be defined as populated places by government entities.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

A town may become a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it has failed, because of a government action, such as the building of a dam that floods the town, or because of natural or human-caused disasters such as floods, uncontrolled lawlessness, or war. The term is sometimes used to refer to cities, towns, and neighborhoods that are still populated, but significantly less so than in years past.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

For smoothing to compensate for [[stochastic]] (unpredictable) errors there must be a sound method for reducing the error budget significantly. The system might include information from other systems to cope for physical ambiguity and to enable error compensation.

Detecting the device's orientation (often referred to as the '''compass direction''' in order to disambiguate it from smartphone vertical orientation) can be achieved either by detecting landmarks inside images taken in real time, or by using trilateration with beacons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse590u/08wi/hilecgasubmit.pdf Positioning and orientation using image processing] a 2007 research from the [[University of Washington]]. Several similar approaches have been developed and there are currently (2017) smartphone applications implementing  this technology.&lt;/ref&gt; There also exist technologies for detecting magnetometric information inside buildings or locations with steel structures or in iron ore mines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.technologyreview.com/s/428494/startup-uses-a-smartphone-compass-to-track-people-indoors/ Startup uses a smartphone to track people indoors],  - About Indoor Atlass (MIT Technology Review website)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applicability and precision ==

Due to the signal [[attenuation]] caused by construction materials, the satellite based [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) loses significant power indoors affecting the required coverage for receivers by at least four satellites. In addition, the multiple reflections at surfaces cause multi-path propagation serving for uncontrollable errors. These very same effects are degrading all known solutions for indoor locating which uses electromagnetic waves from indoor transmitters to indoor receivers. A bundle of physical and mathematical methods are applied to compensate for these problems. Promising direction radiofrequency positioning error correction opened by the use of alternative sources of navigational information, such as [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU), monocular camera [[Simultaneous localization and mapping]] (SLAM) and WiFi SLAM. Integration of data from various navigation systems with different physical principles can increase the accuracy and robustness of the overall solution.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Maximov and Oleg Tabarovsky, LLC RTLS, Moscow, Russia (2013).

== Relation to GPS ==

[[Global navigation satellite system]]s ([[Global Positioning System|GPS]] or [[GNSS]]) are generally not suitable to establish indoor locations, since microwaves will be attenuated and scattered by roofs, walls and other objects. However, in order to make positioning signals ubiquitous, integration between GPS and indoor positioning can be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wan | first1 =  | last2 = Yaakob Wan Bejuri | first2 = Mohd | last3 = Murtadha Mohamad | first3 = Mohd | last4 = Sapri | first4 = Maimunah | year = 2011 | title = Ubiquitous Positioning: A Taxonomy for Location Determination on Mobile Navigation System | url = http://airccse.org/journal/sipij/papers/2111sipij03.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Signal &amp; Image Processing: An International Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 24–34 | doi = 10.5121/sipij.2011.2103 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110322054932/http://airccse.org/journal/sipij/papers/2111sipij03.pdf | archivedate = 2011-03-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wan Mohd Yaakob Wan Bejuri, Mohd Murtadha Mohamad and Raja Zahilah (2015).

Currently, [[GNSS]] receivers are becoming more and more sensitive due to increasing microchip processing power. [[High Sensitivity GPS|High Sensitivity GNSS]] receivers are able to receive satellite signals in most indoor environments and attempts to determine the 3D position indoors have been successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/590|title=GNSS Indoors — Fighting The Fading, Part 1 - Inside GNSS|website=www.insidegnss.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides increasing the sensitivity of the receivers, the technique of [[Assisted GPS|A-GPS]] is used, where the almanac and other information are transferred through a mobile phone.

However, proper coverage for the required four satellites to locate a receiver is not achieved with all current designs (2008–11) for indoor operations. Beyond, the average error budget for GNSS systems normally is much larger than the confinements, in which the locating shall be performed.

== Locating and positioning ==

While most current IPS are able to detect the location of an object, they are so coarse that they cannot be used to detect the ''[[orientation (geometry)|orientation]]'' or ''[[Relative direction|direction]]'' of an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furey | first1 = Eoghan | last2 = Curran | first2 = Kevin | last3 = McKevitt | first3 = Paul | year = 2012 | title = Probabilistic Indoor Human Movement Modeling to Aid First Responders | url = | journal = Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing Vol | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 559–569| doi = 10.1007/s12652-012-0112-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locating and tracking ==
{{See also|Waypoint|point of interest}}
One of the methods to thrive for sufficient operational suitability is "[[Match moving|tracking]]".  Whether a sequence of locations determined form a trajectory from the first to the most actual location. Statistical methods then serve for smoothing the locations determined in a track resembling the physical capabilities of the object to move. This smoothing must be applied, when a target moves and also for a resident target, to compensate erratic measures. Otherwise the single resident location or even the followed trajectory would compose of an itinerant sequence of jumps.

== Identification and segregation ==

In most applications the population of targets is larger than just one. Hence the IPS must serve a proper specific identification for each observed target and must be capable to segregate and separate the targets individually within the group.  An IPS must be able to identify the entities being tracked, despite the "non-interesting" neighbors. Depending on the design, either a sensor network must know from which tag it has received information, or a locating device must be able to identify the targets directly.

== Non-radio technologies ==

Non-radio technologies can be used for positioning without using the existing wireless infrastructure. This can provide increased accuracy at the expense of costly equipment and installations.

=== Magnetic positioning ===
{{main|Magnetic positioning}}
[[Magnetic positioning]] can offer pedestrians with smartphones an indoor accuracy of 1–2 meters with 90% confidence level, without using the additional wireless infrastructure for positioning. Magnetic positioning is based on the iron inside buildings that create local variations in the Earth's magnetic field. Un-optimized compass chips inside smartphones can sense and record these magnetic variations to map indoor locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.geospatialworld.net/wp-content/uploads/magazine/Geospatial-World-August-2014.pdf|title=Geospatial World August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inertial measurements ===

Pedestrian [[dead reckoning]] and other approaches for positioning of pedestrians propose an [[inertial measurement unit]] carried by the pedestrian either by measuring steps indirectly (step counting) or in a foot mounted approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/MCG.2005.140|title=Pedestrian Tracking with Shoe-Mounted Inertial Sensors|first=Eric|last=Foxlin|date=1 November 2005|publisher=|journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|issue=6|pages=38–46|via=www.computer.org|doi=10.1109/MCG.2005.140}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referring to maps or other additional sensors to constrain the inherent sensor drift encountered with inertial navigation. The MEMS inertial sensors suffer from internal noises which result in cubically growing position error with time. To reduce the error growth in such devices a [[Kalman filtering|Kalman Filtering]] based approach is often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8115944/|title=On the noise and power performance of a shoe-mounted multi-IMU inertial positioning system - IEEE Conference Publication|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=A.

=== Positioning based on visual markers ===

A visual positioning system can determine the location of a camera-enabled mobile device by decoding location coordinates from visual markers.  In such a system, markers are placed at specific locations throughout a venue, each marker encoding that location's coordinates: latitude, longitude and height off the floor.  Measuring the visual angle from the device to the marker enables the device to estimate its own location coordinates in reference to the marker. Coordinates include latitude, longitude, level and altitude off the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Michel, (2016) Information Management: Wearables come in for a refit, Modern Materials Handling, Retrieved Dec 28, 2016. [http://www.mmh.com/article/information_management_wearables_come_in_for_a_refit]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Location based on known visual features ===

A collection of successive snapshots from a mobile device's camera can build a database of images that is suitable for estimating location in a venue.  Once the database is built, a mobile device moving through the venue can take snapshots that can be interpolated into the venue's database, yielding location coordinates. These coordinates can be used in conjunction with other location techniques for higher accuracy. Note that this can be a special case of sensor fusion where a camera plays the role of yet another sensor.

== Wireless technologies ==

Any wireless technology can be used for locating. Many different systems take advantage of existing wireless infrastructure for indoor positioning. There are three primary system topology options for hardware and software configuration, network-based, terminal-based, and terminal-assisted. Positioning accuracy can be increased at the expense of wireless infrastructure equipment and installations.

=== Wi-Fi-based positioning system (WPS) ===
{{See also|LiFi}}
[[Wi-Fi positioning system]] (WPS) is used where [[GPS]] is inadequate. The localization technique used for positioning with wireless access points is based on measuring the intensity of the received signal (''[[Received signal strength indication|received signal strength]]'' in English RSS) and the method of "fingerprinting". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Violettas|first=G.

Simple concept of location indexing and presence reporting for tagged objects, uses known sensor identification only.&lt;ref name="reza"/&gt; This is usually the case with passive [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) / [[Near Field Communication|NFC]] systems, which do not report the signal strengths and various distances of single tags or of a bulk of tags and do not renew any before known location coordinates of the sensor or current location of any tags. Operability of such approaches requires some narrow passage to prevent from passing by out of range.

=== Grid concepts ===

Instead of long range measurement, a dense network of low-range receivers may be arranged, e.g. in a grid pattern for economy, throughout the space being observed. Due to the low range, a tagged entity will be identified by only a few close, networked receivers. An identified tag must be within range of the identifying reader, allowing a rough approximation of the tag location. Advanced systems combine visual coverage with a camera grid with the wireless coverage for the rough location.

=== Long range sensor concepts ===

Most systems use a continuous physical measurement (such as angle and distance or distance only) along with the identification data in one combined signal. Reach by these sensors mostly covers an entire floor, or an aisle or just a single room. Short reach solutions get applied with multiple sensors and overlapping reach.

=== Angle of arrival ===

[[Angle of arrival]] (AoA) is the angle from which a signal arrives at a receiver. AoA is usually determined by measuring the [[time difference of arrival]] (TDOA) between multiple antennas in a sensor array. In other receivers, it is determined by an array of highly directional sensors—the angle can be determined by which sensor received the signal. AoA is usually used with [[triangulation]] and a known base line to find the location relative to two anchor transmitters.

=== Time of arrival ===

[[Time of arrival]] (ToA, also time of flight) is the amount of time a signal takes to propagate from transmitter to receiver. Because the signal propagation rate is constant and known (ignoring differences in mediums) the travel time of a signal can be used to directly calculate distance. Multiple measurements can be combined with [[trilateration]] and [[multilateration]] to find a location. This is the technique used by [[GPS]]. Systems which use ToA, generally require a complicated synchronization mechanism to maintain a reliable source of time for sensors (though this can be avoided in carefully designed systems by using repeaters to establish coupling&lt;ref name="zhou" /&gt;).

The accuracy of the TOA based methods often suffers from massive multipath conditions in indoor localization, which is caused by the reflection and diffraction of the RF signal from objects (e.g., interior wall, doors or furniture) in the environment. However, it is possible to reduce the effect of multipath by applying temporal or spatial sparsity based techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Received signal strength indication ===

[[Received signal strength indication]] (RSSI) is a measurement of the power level received by sensor. Because radio waves propagate according to the [[inverse-square law]], distance can be approximated based on the relationship between transmitted and received signal strength (the transmission strength is a constant based on the equipment being used), as long as no other errors contribute to faulty results. The inside of buildings is not [[free space]], so accuracy is significantly impacted by reflection and absorption from walls. Non-stationary objects such as doors, furniture, and people can pose an even greater problem, as they can affect the signal strength in dynamic, unpredictable ways.

A lot of systems use enhanced [[Wi-Fi]] infrastructure to provide location information.&lt;ref name="chang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chiou" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lim" /&gt; None of these systems serves for proper operation with any infrastructure as is. Unfortunately, Wi-Fi signal strength measurements are extremely [[noise|noisy]], so there is ongoing research focused on making more accurate systems by using statistics to filter out the inaccurate input data. [[Wi-Fi Positioning System]]s are sometimes used outdoors as a supplement to GPS on mobile devices, where only few erratic reflections disturb the results.

=== Others ===

* [[Radio frequency identification]]&lt;ref name="reza"/&gt; (RFID): passive tags are very cost-effective, but do not support any metrics
* [[Ultrawide band]]&lt;ref name="zhou" /&gt; (UWB): reduced interference with other devices
* [[Infrared]] (IR): previously included in most mobile devices
* [[Gen2IR (second generation infrared)]] 
* [[Visible light communication]]&lt;ref name="liu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Yong Up; Kavehrad, Mohsen;, "Long-range indoor hybrid localization system design with visible light communications and wireless network," Photonics Society Summer Topical Meeting Series, 2012 IEEE, vol., no., pp.82-83, 9–11 July 2012 [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6280712 See publication here]&lt;/ref&gt; (VLC), as [[LiFi]]: can use existing lighting systems
* [[Ultrasound]]:&lt;ref name="schweinzer"/&gt; waves move very slowly, which results in much higher accuracy

== Mathematics ==

Once sensor data has been collected, an IPS tries to determine the location from which the received transmission was most likely collected. The data from a single sensor is generally ambiguous and must be resolved by a series of statistical procedures to combine several sensor input streams.

=== Empirical method ===

One way to determine position is to match the data from the unknown location with a large set of known locations using an algorithm such as [[k-nearest neighbor algorithm|k-nearest neighbor]]. This technique requires a comprehensive on-site survey and will be inaccurate with any significant change in the environment (due to moving persons or moved objects).

=== Mathematical modeling  ===

Location will be calculated mathematically by approximating signal propagation and finding angles and / or distance. Inverse trigonometry will then be used to determine location:
* [[Trilateration]] (distance from anchors)
* [[Triangulation]] (angle to anchors)
Advanced systems combine more accurate physical models with statistical procedures:
* [[Bayesian statistical analysis]] (probabilistic model)
* [[Kalman filter]]ing&lt;ref name="chiou" /&gt; (for estimating proper value streams under noise conditions).

==Uses==

The major consumer benefit of indoor positioning is the expansion of location-aware mobile computing indoors. As mobile devices become ubiquitous, contextual awareness for applications has become a priority for developers. Most applications currently rely on GPS, however, and function poorly indoors. Applications benefiting from indoor location include:

'''Korean nationalism''' refers to [[nationalism]] among the [[Korean people]]. In the Korean context, this encompasses various movements throughout history to maintain the Korean cultural identity, history, and ethnicity. Korean nationalism tends to be [[Korean ethnic nationalism|ethnic]] and racial in nature, rather than [[Civic nationalism|civic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shin|first=Gi-Wook|title=Ethnic Nationalism in Korea|year=2006|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=California|isbn=0-8047-5407-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KoreaShrug&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/opinion/28myers.html |title=South Korea's Collective Shrug |date=27 May 2010 |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |first=Brian Reynolds |last=Myers |authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers |accessdate=April 19, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419024409/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/opinion/28myers.html |archivedate=April 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UnlovedRepublic&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/korea/south-korea-unloved-republic |first=Brian Reynolds |last=Myers |authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers |title=South Korea: The Unloved Republic? |date=14 September 2010 |accessdate=19 May 2013|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519065927/http://asiasociety.org/korea/south-korea-unloved-republic |archivedate=May 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OathChosunIlbo&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/04/18/2011041801112.html |title=New Pledge of Allegiance to Reflect Growing Multiculturalism |quote=The military has decided to omit the word 'minjok,' which refers to the Korean race, from the oath of enlistment for officers and soldiers, and replace it with 'the citizen.'

==History==
Historically, the central objectives of Korea's nationalist movement were the advancement and protection of Korea's ancient culture and national identity from foreign influence, and the fostering of the independence movement during [[Colonial Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ryu-1999|Ryu Tongshik (1999)]] - ''While Japanese scholars were pursuing colonialist aims in research on Korea culture, Korean scholars on the other hand began their own research in order to discover in the traditional culture the spiritual basis for the independence movement against Japan.''&lt;/ref&gt; In order to obtain political and cultural autonomy, it first had to promote Korea's cultural dependency. For this reason, the nationalist movement demanded the restoration and preservation of Korea's traditional culture. The [[Donghak]] (Eastern Learning) peasant movement, also known as the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]], that began in the 1870s, could be seen as an early form of what would become the Korean nationalist resistance movement against foreign influences. It was succeeded by the [[Righteous Army]] movement and later a series of Korean resistance movements that led, in part, to the current status of the two Korean nations.

===National resistance movements===
{{Main|Korean independence movement}}

Nationalism in late 19th century Korea was a form of resistance movements, but with significant differences between the north and south. Since the intrusion by foreign powers in the late 19th century, Koreans have had to construct their identity in ways that pitted them against foreigners. They have witnessed and participated in a wide range of nationalist actions over the past century, but all of them have been some form of resistance against foreign influences. During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|colonial period]], the Korean nationalists carried on the struggle for independence, fighting against [[Imperial Japan]] in Korea, China particularly Manchuria and China Proper and Far East Russia. They formed 'governments in exile', armies, and secret groups to fight the imperial Japanese wherever they are.

===Partition of Korea===
{{Main|Division of Korea|North Korea–South Korea relations}}

Korea was divided at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] between north and south by the Allied powers in 1945 as part of the disarmament of [[Imperial Japan]], and the division persists to this day. The split is perpetuated by rival regimes, opposing [[ideologies]], and global [[politics]]; it is further deepened by a differing sense of national identity derived from the unique histories, polities, class systems, and gender roles experienced by Koreans on different sides of the border. As a result, Korean nationalism in the late 20th century has been permeated by the split between North and South. Each regime espouses its own distinctive form of nationalism, different from the opposing side's, that nonetheless seeks to encompass the entire [[Korean Peninsula]] in its scope.

===Korean reunification===
{{Main|Korean reunification}}

With regard to Korean nationalism, the reunification of the two Koreas is a highly related issue. Ethnic nationalism that is prevalent in Korean society is likely to play a significant role in the unification process, if it does occur. As Gi-Wook Shin claims, “Ethnic consciousness would not only legitimize the drive for unification but also could be common ground, especially in the early stage of the unification process, that is needed to facilitate a smooth integration of the two systems.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shin|first=Gi-Wook|title=Ethnic Nationalism in Korea|year=2006|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=California|isbn=0-8047-5407-1|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korean reunification ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 남북통일) refers to the hypothetical future reunification of [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] under a single government. South Korea had adopted a [[sunshine policy]] towards the North that was based on the hope that one day, the two countries would be re-united in the 1990s. The process towards this was started by the historic [[June 15th North–South Joint Declaration]] in August&amp;nbsp;2000, where the two countries agreed to work towards a peaceful reunification in the future. However, there are a number of hurdles in this process due to the large political and economic differences between the two countries and other state actors such as China, Russia, and the United States. Short-term problems such as a large number of [[refugee]]s from the North migrating into the South and initial economic and political instability would need to be overcome.

==State-aligned nationalism==
===North Korea===
{{Further|Juche}}

In [[North Korea]], nationalism is incorporated as part of the state-sponsored ideology of ''[[Juche]]''. The ''Juche'' Idea teaches that "man is the master of everything and decides everything",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Lee |first1 = Kyo Duk |authorlink= |year= 2004 |title = The successor theory of North Korea |publisher=Korean Institute for National Reunification |url = http://www.kinu.or.kr/eng/pub/pub_02_01.jsp?page=8&amp;field=&amp;text=&amp;order=&amp;dir=&amp;mode=list&amp;bid=DATA05&amp;ses=&amp;category= |isbn = 898479225X |page=4 |chapter = 'Peaceful Utilization of the DMZ' as a National Strategy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Korean people are the masters of Korea's revolution. ''Juche'' is a component of North Korea's political system. The word literally means "main body" or "subject"; it has also been translated in North Korean sources as "independent stand" and the "spirit of self-reliance".

The ''Juche'' Idea gradually emerged as a systematic ideological doctrine in the 1960s. [[Kim Il-sung]] outlined the three fundamental principles of ''Juche'' as being:
#"independence in politics" (''chaju'').
#"self-sustenance in the economy" (''charip'').
#"self-defense in national defense" (''chawi'').

Unlike in South Korea, North Koreans tend to see the North Korean state and the "Korean race" (Korean: ''Minjok'') as being analogous.&lt;ref name=KoreaShrug/&gt;&lt;ref name=UnlovedRepublic/&gt;

===South Korea===
While nationalistic theory and practice during the colonial era and the [[First Republic of South Korea]] were class-based and movement specific forces, in the [[South Korea]] of recent times (1990s onward) a more broad-based (including middle-income classes) sentiment has developed in the national ethos, the so-called "New Nationalism." Two ideologies drive the new nationalism: the old national liberation movement logic of anti-imperialism on the one hand, and a [[state-worshipping ideology]] introduced by the [[Park Jung-Hee]] regime and embodied in its pledge of National Allegiance (국민교육헌장), on the other hand.

The "New" South Korean nationalism drives public policy and has been a powerful controlling force upon the South Korean [[polity]] since 2004. It has had a coercive power to raise national consensus on such divisive issues as the South Korea's participation in the [[War on Iraq]], strengthened gestures for sovereignty in the face of a unilateral military alliance with the [[United States]], modern confrontations with [[China]] and [[Japan]] over territorial issues, and so forth.

State-based nationalism in South Korea is weak, compared with the more salient racial nationalism.&lt;ref name=KoreaShrug/&gt;&lt;ref name=UnlovedRepublic/&gt; Most South Koreans tend to see the "Korean race" and the South Korean state as being separate subjects, whereas in North Korea, its citizens see the North Korean state and the "Korean race" as being coterminous.&lt;ref name=KoreaShrug/&gt;&lt;ref name=UnlovedRepublic/&gt; Due to the tradition and state support for race nationalism, South Koreans tend to see positive achievements as being a result of inherent racial characteristics, whereas negative events are attributed to the incompetence and inherent inferiority of the state.&lt;ref name=KoreaShrug/&gt;&lt;ref name=UnlovedRepublic/&gt;{{verification failed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isis.org.my/files/IF_2013/IF8/IF8_I2.pdf|title=Pride of the People: South Korea and Korean Nationalism|last=Jing Yin|first=Seow|date=2013|website=ISIS Malaysia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons of South Koreans' lack of support for the South Korean state is due to the popular misconception that only North Korea purged its regime of pro-Japanese collaborators of the colonial period.&lt;ref name=KoreaShrug/&gt; According to [[Brian Reynolds Myers]], a professor at [[Dongseo University]]:

This weak state nationalism was reflected in the former South Korean military oath and former pledge of allegiance, which pledged allegiance to the "Korean race" over the state.&lt;ref name=OathChosunIlbo/&gt;&lt;ref name=YuriWDoolan2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=REKelly2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=UnlovedRepublic/&gt;&lt;ref name=REKelly2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hankyoreh2006&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.li/ymvn0/2d6f348b51de2d6952d65edd223d1f5a3202c141/scr.png |title=A pledge to a nation, or a gang oath? |last=Jeong |first=Jeong-hun |date=2006 |work=The Hankyoreh |publisher=The Hankyoreh Media Company |location=South Korea |accessdate=March 15, 2016 |df= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315142703/https://archive.li/ymvn0/2d6f348b51de2d6952d65edd223d1f5a3202c141/scr.png |archivedate=March 15, 2016 |deadurl=no}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular issues==
===Anti-Japanese sentiment===
{{Main|Japan–Korea disputes}}

The legacy of the colonial period of Korean history continues to fuel recriminations and demands for restitution in both Koreas. North and South Korea have both lodged severe protests against visits by Japanese officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which is seen as glorifying the Class A [[war criminals]] whose remains are held there. Koreans claim that a number of Korean women who worked near Japanese military bases as [[comfort women]] were forced to serve as sex slaves against their will for Japanese soldiers during [[World War II]] which is a persistent thorn in the side of Japan-Korea relations since the 1990s. Disagreements over demands for reparations and a formal apology still remain unresolved despite the previous agreement and compensation in 1965, Koreans started peaceful vigils in 1992 held by survivors on a weekly basis. Recent [[Japanese history textbook controversies]] have emerged as a result of what some see as an attempt at historical revisionism with the aim of whitewashing or ignoring Japan's war crimes during [[World War II]]. These issues continue to separate the two countries diplomatically, and provide fuel for nationalism in both Koreas as well as [[anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea|anti-Japanese sentiment]].

According to [[Robert E. Kelly]], a professor at [[Pusan National University]], anti-Japanese racism in South Korea stems not just from Imperial Japanese atrocities during the colonial era, but from the Korean Peninsula's division.&lt;ref name=REKelly2015/&gt; As a result, Kelly says, South Koreans take out the anger rising from Korean division against Japan.&lt;ref name=REKelly2015/&gt; This view is supported by another professor, [[Brian Reynolds Myers]] of [[Dongseo University]].&lt;ref name=KoreaShrug/&gt;&lt;ref name=UnlovedRepublic/&gt;{{verify source|date=January 2017}}

====Liancourt Rocks dispute====
{{Main|Liancourt Rocks dispute}}

The [[Liancourt Rocks]] dispute has been ongoing since the end of [[World War II]] after the United States rejected Korea's claim to give sovereignty of the Liancourt Rocks islands, known as Dokdo or Tokto (독도/獨島, literally "solitary island") in Korean and Takeshima in Japanese, to Korea in the 1951.
Since 1954, the South Koreans have administered the islands but bickering on both sides involving nationalism and lingering historical acrimony has led to the current impasse. Adding to this problem is political pressure from conservative politicians and nationalist groups in both [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] to have more assertive territorial policies.

With the introduction of the 1994 [[UN Law of the Sea Convention]], South Korea and Japan began to set their new [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]], particularly in overlapping terrain in the [[Sea of Japan]] (East Sea), where some [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) borders was less than {{convert|400|nmi|km|-2}} apart.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MinGyoKoo|Min Gyo Koo]]. ''Following the introduction of the UN Law of the Sea in 1994, South Korea and Japan both began proceeding to set their new maritime boundaries, particularly in overlapping terrain in the East Sea/Sea of Japan, where the distance between some EEZ baselines was less than 400nm.''&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions escalated in 1996 when both governments declared a {{convert|200|nmi|km|-2|sing=on}} EEZ that encompassed the island, which brought Japan-South Korean relations to an all-time low.

This has not only complicated bilateral relations but heightened nationalist sentiments on both sides. In spite of generational change and the passage of time, the institutionalization of Korean collective memory is causing young Koreans to be as anti-Japanese, if not more so, than the older generation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Berger-2005|Berger (2005 paper)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=November 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4108&amp;context=capstones|title=Anti-Japanese Sentiment among Graduates of South Korean Public Schools|last=Barbari|first=Jamal|date=December 2017|website=SIT {{!}} Digital Collections|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Koreans, "historical memory and feelings of ''han'' (resentment) run deeply and can influence Korea's relations with its neighbors, allies, and enemies in ways not easily predicted by models of policy-making predicated on realpolitik or other geo-strategic or economic concerns."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Larsen-2006|Larsen, Kirk (2006 talk)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=November 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2012/08/272_41770.html|title=Psychology of Korean Han|last=Huer|first=Jon|date=|website=The Korea Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Korea’s colonial past, safeguarding the island has become equivalent to safeguarding the nation-state and its national identity. A territory’s value and importance is not limited to its physical dimensions but also the psychological value it holds as a source of sovereignty and identity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wang-2003|Wang (2003)]], page 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Triggered by strong feelings of injustice and humiliation, Korean nationalistic sentiment has become involved in the dispute. The island itself has become to symbolize Korean national identity and pride, making it an issue even more difficult to resolve.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MinGyoKoo|Min Gyo Koo]]. ''In addition, the symbolic attachment of territory to national identity and pride has made the island dispute all the more intractable and difficult to resolve.''&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea’s claim to the island holds emotional content that goes beyond material significance, and giving way on the island issue to Japan would be seen as compromising the sovereignty of the entire peninsula.

The South Korean government has also played a role in fanning nationalism in this dispute. President Roh Moo-hyun began a speech on Korea-Japan relations in April 2006 by bluntly stating, “The island is our land” and “for Koreans, the island is a symbol of the complete recovery of sovereignty.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Roh-2006|Speech by Roh Moo-hyun]] (April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of the island is clearly tied to the protection of the nation-state that was once taken away by Japan. President Roh emphasizes this point again by saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Dokdo for us is not merely a matter pertaining to territorial rights over tiny islets but is emblematic of bringing closure to an unjust chapter in our history with Japan and of the full consolidation of Korea’s sovereignty.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later on in his speech Roh also mentions the Yasukuni Shrine and Japanese history textbook controversy, saying that they will be dealt with together.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roh-2006|Speech by Roh Moo-hyun]] (April 2006) - ''The government will revisit the entirety of our response with regard to the matter of Dokdo. Together with the distortion of Japanese history textbooks and visits to the Yasukuni shrine, the matter of Dokdo will be dealt with head on. It will be reviewed in the context of rectifying the historical record between Korea and Japan and historical awareness building, our history of self-reliance and independence, and the safeguarding of our sovereignty.''&lt;/ref&gt; Having placed the Liancourt Rocks issue "in the context of rectifying the historical record between Korea and Japan" and "the safeguarding of [Korea's] sovereignty", compromise becomes impossible.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roh-2006|Speech by Roh Moo-hyun]] (April 2006) ''For this is a matter where no compromise or surrender is possible, whatever the costs and sacrifices may be.''&lt;/ref&gt; As the French theorist [[Ernest Renan]] said, "Where national memories are concerned, griefs are of more value than triumphs, for they impose duties, and require a common effort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalismproject.org/what/renan.htm|author=Ernest Renan|origyear=1882|date=October 17, 2010&lt;!--|orig_title="What is a Nation?"--&gt;|title=The Nationalism Project - Ernest Renan Defining the Nation}} - Delivered as a lecture at the Sorbonne in 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liancourt Rocks dispute has affected the Korean and Japanese perceptions of each other. According to a 2008 survey by Gallup Korea and the Japan Research Center, 20% of Koreans had friendly feelings towards Japan and 36% of Japanese the same towards Korea. When asked for the reason of their antipathy, most Koreans mentioned the territorial dispute over the island, and the Japanese the anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea. This is in contrast to a 2002 survey (post [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]) conducted by the Chosun Ilbo and Mainichi Shimbun, where 35% of Koreans and 69% of Japanese had friendly views of the other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Friendliness Between Japan and Korea Withering.|newspaper=Chosun Ilbo.|date=May 17, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331170202/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200705/200705170007.html|archivedate=March 31, 2008|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200705/200705170007.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-American sentiment===
{{Main|Anti-American sentiment in Korea}}

Anti-Americanism in Korea began with the earliest contact between the two nations and continued after the [[division of Korea]]. In both [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]], anti-Americanism after the [[Korean War]] has focused on the presence and behavior of American military personnel ([[USFK]]), aggravated especially by high-profile accidents or crimes by U.S. servicemembers, with various crimes including [[rape]] and [[assault]], among others.

The 2002 [[Yangju highway incident]] especially ignited Anti-American passions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kirk-2002|Don Kirk (2002)]] for the International Herald Tribune. ''"Basically, the entire country is galvanized behind this incident," said a U.S. official in Seoul, speaking anonymously. "It will be forever brought up in news articles that we callously ran over these two girls. I don't think we are going to recover from this."
.''&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing U.S. military presence in South Korea, especially at the [[Yongsan Garrison]] (on a base previously used by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during [[Korea under Japanese rule|Colonial Korea]]) in central [[Seoul]], remains a contentious issue. While protests have arisen over specific incidents, they are often reflective of deeper historical resentments. Robert Hathaway, director of the Wilson Center's Asia program, suggests: "the growth of anti-American sentiment in both Japan and South Korea must be seen not simply as a response to American policies and actions, but as reflective of deeper domestic trends and developments within these Asian countries."&lt;ref&gt;[[#WilsonCenter|Wilson Center]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Korean anti-Americanism after the war was fueled by American occupation of USFK troops and support for the authoritarian rule of [[Park Chung-hee]], and what was perceived as an American endorsement of the brutal tactics used in the [[Gwangju massacre#The Gwangju Movement and the United States|Gwangju massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kristof-1987|Kristof (1987)]], for the ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to the Wilson Center, Katherine Moon was noted by Hathaway as suggesting that "anti-Americanism also represents the collective venting of accumulated grievances that in many instances have lain hidden for decades", but that despite the "very public demonstrations of anger toward the United States [...] the majority of Koreans of all age groups supports the continuation of the American alliance."&lt;ref&gt;[[#WilsonCenter|Wilson Center]]. This is Hathaway's summary; it does not appear to be a direct quote from Moon&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchuria and Gando disputes===
Korean nationalist historians have claimed that [[Manchuria]] ([[Northeast China]]), in particular [[Jiandao|Gando]] (known in China as Jiandao), a region bordering China, North Korea, and Russia, and home to the [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]] should be part of Korea, based on prior [[Goguryeo]] control of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lankov-2006|Lankov, Andrei (2006)]] for the Asia Times Online. ''Since long ago, the more radical Korean nationalist historians have paid much attention to the "Manchurian question", insisting that the vast lands of China's northeast, which once were realms of the Koguryo rulers, should be returned to the "lawful owner" - that is, to the present-day Korean state.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apjjf.org/-Andrei-Lankov/2509/article.html|title=China's Korean Autonomous Prefecture and China-Korea Border Politics {{!}} The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|date=2007-07-01|website=apjjf.org|publisher=The Asia Pacific Journal|access-date=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Greater Korea, sometimes used in nationalist works, usually enompasses those regions located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yun|first=Peter|date=2016-02-28|title=Guest Editor’s Introduction: Manchuria and Korea in East Asian History|url=http://ijkh.khistory.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.22372/ijkh.2016.21.1.1|journal=International Journal of Korean History|language=English|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.22372/ijkh.2016.21.1.1|issn=1598-2041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The claim for Gando is said to be stronger than the claim for the whole of Manchuria, due to later [[Balhae]] presence in Gando after the fall of the Koguryo kingdom, the current area population's consisting of 1/3 ethnic Koreans,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lankov-2006|Lankov, Andrei (2006)]] for the Asia Times Online. ''It does not help that the claimed territory already has a large Korean presence, with ethnic Koreans constituting about a third of all Kando residents. At this stage it seems that their loyalties overwhelmingly remain with Beijing, but the Korean activity in the area is unnerving for Chinese policy planners.''&lt;/ref&gt; and the circumstances of the [[Gando Convention|1909 Gando Convention]] that relegated the area to Chinese control.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lankov-2006|Lankov, Andrei (2006)]] for the Asia Times Online. ''In 1909, the Japanese, acting "on behalf" of the Koreans, agreed to complete Chinese sovereignty over the area. In recent years it became clear that a large number of Koreans were demanding the revision of the 1909 treaty.''&lt;/ref&gt; While the Manchurian claims have not received official attention in South Korea, claims for Gando were the subject of a bill introduced in 2004, at a time when China had been claiming that Balhae and Koguryo had been "minority states" within China and the resulting controversy was at its height.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lankov-2006|Lankov, Andrei (2006)]] for the Asia Times Online. ''in 2004, the Koreans discovered that both Koguryo and its quasi-successor state of Parhae are presented in the new Chinese-language books as parts of China, as "minority states" that existed within the supposedly single Chinese nation. Statements to this effect even appeared on the Chinese Foreign Ministry website.''&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation proposed by 59 South Korean lawmakers would have declared the Gando Convention signed under Japanese rule to be "null and void".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lankov-2006|Lankov, Andrei (2006)]] for the Asia Times Online. ''In late 2004, when the first round of the "history war" reached its height, a group of 59 South Korean lawmakers even introduced a bill that declared the 1909 Sino-Japanese treaty "null and void" and demanded recognition of Korean territorial rights over Kando.''&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the two countries reached an understanding that their governments would refrain from further involvement in the historical controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lankov-2006|Lankov, Andrei (2006)]] for the Asia Times Online. ''Finally, in August 2004, the sides reached an agreement: the bureaucracies promised to refrain from waging "history wars", leaving arguments to the historians.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic nationalism==
{{undue|section|date=July 2016}}
{{Main|Korean ethnic nationalism}}
Ethnic nationalism emphasizes descent and race. Among some Koreans, ethnicity is interpreted with blood being the key determinant in defining "Koreanness".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{verify source|date=October 2010}}

===Importance of blood===
The term "pure blood" refers to the belief that Korean people are a pure race descended from a single ancestor. First invoked during the period of resistance to colonial rule, the idea of having pure blood gave Koreans an impetus for developing a sense of ethnic homogeneity and national pride, as well as a potential catalyst for racial discrimination and prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shin-2006-op-ed|Gi-wook Shin (2006 op-ed)]]. ''The principle of bloodline or "jus sanguinis" still defines the notion of Korean nationhood and citizenship, which are often inseparable in the mind of Koreans. In its formative years Koreans developed the ethnic base of nation without a corresponding attention to the political notion of citizenship.'' also see ''The Korean nationality law is still based on jus sanguinis and legitimizes, consciously or unconsciously, ethnic discrimination against foreign migrant workers.''&lt;/ref&gt; As a way of resisting colonial rule, [[Shin Chaeho]] published his book ''[[Joseon Sanggosa]]'' in the 1920s, proclaiming that Korean descent is based on the [[Goguryeo]] kingdom, formed from the intermingling of the descendants of [[Dangun Joseon]] with the [[Buyeo kingdom]]. This raised a sense of ethnic homogeneity which persists as a major element in Korea's politics and foreign relations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shin-2006-op-ed|Gi-wook Shin (2006 op-ed)]]. ''According to him, the Korean people were descendants of Dangun Joseon, who merged with Buyo of Manchuria to form the Goguryeo people. This original blend, Shin contended, remained the ethnic or racial core of the Korean nation'' and also see ''Even today, Koreans maintain a strong sense of ethnic homogeneity based on shared blood and ancestry, and nationalism continues to function as a key resource in Korean politics and foreign relations.''&lt;/ref&gt; A survey in 2006 showed that 68.2% of respondents considered "blood" the most important criterion of defining the Korean nation, and 74.9% agreed that "Koreans are all brothers and sisters regardless of residence and ideology."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{verify source|date=October 2010}}

Brian Myers argues in his book ''[[The Cleanest Race|The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves and Why It Matters]]'' (2010) that the North Korean ideology of &lt;!--[[Juche]]?--&gt; purest race arose from [[Japanese fascism]]. Japanese collaborators are said to have introduced the notion of racial unity in an effort to assert that Japanese and Koreans came from the same racial stock. After Japan left, Myers argues, the theory was adjusted to promote the idea of a pure Korean race.&lt;ref name=ucb&gt;[[#Cockrell-2010|Cockrell]] (2010). ''But in the early 20th century the Japanese annexed Korea and launched a campaign to persuade the peninsula's people that they were of the same pure racial stock as the Japanese themselves, said Myers. Then, when Japan left Korea at the end of WWII, pro-Japanese collaborators Koreanized the notion of a pure blood line, promoting pride in a morally superior Korean race.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreigners may be subject to questions regarding the purity of their blood line, with potential employers "wanting to know what "percentage" of their bloodline was mixed"

===Nationalist historiography===
{{Main|Korean nationalist historiography}}
[[File:단재신채호.jpg|thumb|[[Shin Chaeho]] (1880–1936), founder of Korea's nationalist historiography]]

[[Shin Chaeho]] was the first historian to focus on the Korean ''minjok'' (or ethnicity), and narrated Korean history in terms of its ''minjok'' history. For Shin, ''minjok'' and history were mutually defining and as he says in the preface of the'' [[Doksa Sillon]]'', “if one dismisses the ''minjok'', there is no history.” Shin emphasized the ancientness of the Korean ''minjok'' history, elevated the status of the semi-legendary figure, [[Dangun]], as the primordial ancestor of the Korean people and located the host ''minjok'', [[Buyeo Kingdom|Puyo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schmid-1997|Schmid (1997)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Shin launched a vision of the Korean nation as a historically defined ''minjok'' or ethnicity entity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chang-1986|Chang (1986)]]&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to counter China's controversial [[Northeast Project]] and [[Goguryeo controversies]] that ensued, the South Korean government in 2007 incorporated the founding of [[Gojoseon]] of the year 2333 BCE into its textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kim-2007|Kim (2007)]]. ''The move is apparently a response to recent efforts by Chinese scholars to strengthen their claim over the heritage of Kojoson and other kingdoms such as Koguryo (37 B.C. - A.D. 668), which Korea states are part of its national history.''; see also ''The new history books write that Kojoson was set up in 2333 B.C. and adds that "it is recorded by Samgukyusa and Tongguktonggam that Kojoson was established by Tangun."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although large Muslim communities have existed on the continent since Ottoman conquests in the late [[Middle Ages]], especially in the [[Balkans]], this was the first major wave of immigration of Muslims to [[northwestern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrett|first=Darcy M.|title=Concepts of Identity and the Islamitization of Europe: The Components of Growth and Radicalization of the Global Salafi Islamic Movement in Europe and Its Implications for the West|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9780549970705|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam in Europe|Muslims in Europe]] are not a homogeneous group. They are of various national, ethnic and racial identities. The top regions of origin of Muslims in Western Europe are [[Turkey]], the [[Maghreb]] (including [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]]), and [[South Asia]] (including [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]).&lt;ref name="Nydell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nydell|first=Margaret K.|title=Understanding Arabs: a contemporary guide to Arab society|publisher=Intercultural Press|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9780983955801|page=132|quote=In 2011 they constituted 25 percent of Rotterdam andMarseilles; 20% of Malmo; 15 percent of Amsterdam, Brussels and Birmingham; 90% of Sarajevo; and 10 percent of London, Paris, Copenhagen, and Vienna. &lt;br/&gt; Muslims in Western Europe originate from both Arab and non-Arab countries. Those in the United Kingdom are primarily from South Asia, in France from North and West Africa, in Germany from Turkey, in Belgium from Morocco, and in the Netherlands from Morocco and Turkey.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western Europe, Muslims generally live in major urban areas, often concentrated in poor neighborhoods of large cities.&lt;ref name="Farmer 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farmer|first=Brian R.|title=Radical Islam in the West: ideology and challenge|year=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=9780786459537|page=8|quote=Muslims living in the West are also concentrated in urban area. Muslims are currently estimated to compose almost one-fifth of the population of Marseilles, and 15 percent of Paris, Brussels, and Birmingham. Muslims are currently make up approximately 10 percent of the populations in London and Copenhagen.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Pew Forum]], the total number of Muslims in Europe in 2010 was about 44 million (6%).&lt;ref name="pewforum2011"&gt;[[Pew Forum]], The Future of the Global Muslim Population, January 2011, {{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/The-Future-of-the-Global-Muslim-Population.aspx?print%3Dtrue |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323024339/http://www.pewforum.org/The-Future-of-the-Global-Muslim-Population.aspx?print=true |archivedate=23 March 2012 |df= }}, {{cite web|url=http://features.pewforum.org/muslim-population/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209094904/http://www.pewforum.org/The-Future-of-the-Global-Muslim-Population.aspx |archivedate=9 February 2011 |df= }}, {{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-regional-europe.aspx?print%3Dtrue |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209094904/http://www.pewforum.org/The-Future-of-the-Global-Muslim-Population.aspx |archivedate=9 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of Muslims in the [[European Union]] in 2010 was about 19 million (3.8%).&lt;ref name="pewforum2011"/&gt; The French capital of [[Paris]] and [[Île-de-France|its metropolitan area]] has the largest number (up to 1.7 million according to ''[[The Economist]]'')&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=When islam claims to be the victim|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12724966?story_id=12724966|accessdate=28 January 2013|date=4 December 2008|agency=''[[The Economist]]''|quote=see the chart [http://media.economist.com/images/20081206/CIR556.gif]}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Muslims out of any city in the [[European Union]]. [[London]] also has a substantial community of Muslim origin, numbering about 1 million within the limits of [[Greater London]] and exceeding this figure when the entire metropolitan area is taken into account.

By 2030, people of Muslim faith or origin are predicted to form about 10% of the population of France&lt;ref name="pewforum2011"/&gt; and 8% of the population of Europe. &lt;ref name="pewforum2011"/&gt;

The table below lists large cities of the European Union with significant Muslim populations, some estimating the percentage of Muslims by using the percentage of Asians in those cities.

This is a '''list of diplomatic missions in [[Afghanistan]]'''.  At present, the capital city of [[Kabul]] hosts 37 embassies.  With the presence of [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] troops, many of the organization's members have opened embassies in the country.  This listing excludes honorary consulates.

A '''[[Kennel Club]]''' (known as a Kennel Council or Canine Council in some countries) is an organization for [[dog|canine]] affairs that concerns itself with the breeding, showing and promotion of more than one breed of [[dog]]. All-encompassing kennel clubs are also referred to as 'all-breed clubs', although "all" means only those breeds that they have decided to recognize, and "breed" means [[Purebred (dog)|purebred]] dogs, not including dog hybrids and crossbreeds or [[mixed-breed dogs]]. A club that handles only one breed is known as a [[breed club]].

[[File:Harare Central Station.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Harare]] railway station, in Zimbabwe's capital city. Harare was called Salisbury until 1982.]]
Place names in Zimbabwe, including the name of the country itself, have been [[Geographical renaming|altered]] at various points in history. The name [[Zimbabwe]] was officially adopted concurrently with Britain's grant of independence in April 1980. Prior to that point, the country had been called [[Southern Rhodesia]] from 1898 to 1964 (or 1980, according to British law), [[Rhodesia]] from 1964 to 1979, and [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] between June and December 1979. Since Zimbabwean independence in 1980, the names of cities, towns, streets and other places have been changed by the government, most prominently in a burst of renaming in 1982.

The Zimbabwean government began renaming cities, towns, streets and other places in 1982, hoping to remove vestiges of British and Rhodesian rule. The capital city, Salisbury, was renamed [[Harare]]. Many other place names merely had their spellings altered to better reflect local pronunciation in [[Shona language|Shona]] or [[Kalanga language|Kalanga]], as under white rule the spellings officially adopted often coincided with pronunciation in [[Northern Ndebele language|Sindebele]]. Most major cities and towns were renamed, but some places with an [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] majority—such as [[Bulawayo]], the country's second city—were not. Some smaller towns retain their colonial-era names, such as [[Beitbridge]], [[West Nicholson]] and [[Fort Rixon]]. Street names were changed wholesale, with British-style names, particularly those of colonial figures, being phased out in favour of those of black nationalist leaders, prominently [[Robert Mugabe]], [[Joshua Nkomo]] and [[Jason Moyo]].

==Name of the country==
[[File:Rhodesia map EB1911.png|thumb|A 1911 map of Rhodesia, with present-day Zimbabwe labelled as [[Southern Rhodesia]]]]
The name of the country has changed several times since it was originally demarcated in the late-nineteenth century by [[Cecil Rhodes]]' [[British South Africa Company]]. The company initially referred to each territory it acquired by its respective name—[[Mashonaland]], [[Matabeleland]] and so on—and collectively called its lands "Zambesia" (Rhodes' personal preference) or "Charterland" ([[Leander Starr Jameson]]'s), but neither of these caught on. Most of the first settlers instead called their new home [[Rhodesia (name)|Rhodesia]], after Rhodes; this was common enough usage by 1891 to be used by journalists.&lt;ref name=blake114/&gt; In 1892, the ''Rhodesia Chronicle'' and ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Rhodesia Herald]]'' newspapers were first published, respectively at Tuli and Salisbury. The company officially applied the name Rhodesia in 1895.&lt;ref name=brelsford&gt;{{cite journal

The name "Zimbabwe", based on a [[Shona language|Shona]] term for [[Great Zimbabwe]], an ancient ruined city in the country's south-east, was first recorded as a term of national reference in 1960, when it was coined by the black nationalist Michael Mawema,&lt;ref name=fontein119120/&gt; whose Zimbabwe National Party became the first to officially use the name in 1961.&lt;ref name=ndlovugatsheni113114/&gt;  The term Rhodesia, derived from Rhodes' surname, was perceived as inappropriate because of its colonial origin and connotations.&lt;ref name=fontein119120&gt;{{cite book

It was initially not clear how the chosen term was to be used—a letter written by Mawema in 1961 refers to "Zimbabweland"&lt;ref name=ndlovugatsheni113114/&gt;—but "Zimbabwe" was sufficiently established by 1962 to become the generally preferred term of the black nationalist movement.&lt;ref name=fontein119120/&gt; In a 2001 interview, black nationalist [[Edson Zvobgo]] recalled that the name was mentioned by Mawema during a political rally, "and it caught hold, and that was that".&lt;ref name=fontein119120/&gt; The name was subsequently used by the black nationalist factions during the Second ''Chimurenga'' campaigns against the Rhodesian government during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]]. The most major of these were the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (led by [[Robert Mugabe]] from 1975), and the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]], led by [[Joshua Nkomo]] from its founding in the early-1960s.

When Northern Rhodesia achieved independence as Zambia in 1964, the Southern Rhodesian government introduced a bill to allow the country to be known simply as [[Rhodesia]], which passed its third reading on 9 December 1964. Although no assent was given to the bill, the revised name was widely adopted, and following the [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] in 1965, it was the name of the unrecognised government.&lt;ref name="palleycountryname"&gt;{{cite book

The country adopted the name [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]]. Following the terms of the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] of December 1979 that the United Kingdom should preside over fresh elections before granting independence, direct British control started that month with reversion to the former name of Southern Rhodesia. The UK granted independence under the name Zimbabwe on 18 April 1980.&lt;ref name="wessels273"&gt;{{cite book

==Geographical renaming since 1980==

Starting in 1982, on the second anniversary of the country's independence as Zimbabwe, the government began renaming cities, towns and streets in an attempt to eradicate symbols of British colonialism and white minority rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Names (Alteration) Act |url=http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/attachments/article/96/NAMES_ALTERATION_ACT_10_14.pdf |work=parlzim.gov.zw |publisher=[[Parliament of Zimbabwe]] |year=1982 |location=Harare |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203041146/http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/attachments/article/96/NAMES_ALTERATION_ACT_10_14.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital Salisbury, which had been named after the British Prime Minister, the [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], was renamed [[Harare]], after the Shona chief Neharawa. Other place names were simply new [[transliteration]]s, to reflect the correct pronunciation in the relevant local language—many places had been denoted with the [[Northern Ndebele language|Sindebele language]] pronunciation during the colonial period. This generally included the letter "[[l]]", which does not exist in Shona, being used instead of "r".

While most larger cities and towns were renamed, the European spelling of Zimbabwe's second-largest city, [[Bulawayo]], remains unchanged. Other towns which have retained names of European origin include mostly smaller communities such as [[Beitbridge]], [[Colleen Bawn]], [[West Nicholson]], [[Fort Rixon]], [[Craigmore, Zimbabwe|Craigmore]], [[Cashel, Zimbabwe|Cashel]], [[Juliasdale]], [[Glendale, Zimbabwe|Glendale]], and [[Birchenough Bridge]]. The colonial-era names of [[Harare#Suburbs|suburbs of Harare]], such as Borrowdale, Highlands, Rietfontein, Tynwald, and Mount Pleasant also remained unchanged. An exception was Harari, which was renamed [[Mbare]].

[[Street name]]s were also changed, with names of British colonists such as [[Cecil Rhodes]] being replaced with those of Zimbabwean nationalist leaders, such as [[Jason Moyo]], [[Josiah Tongogara]], [[Simon Muzenda]], and [[Leopold Takawira]]. [[Robert Mugabe]]'s name eventually became attached to the main street or town centre of every sizeable town as a result of a spate of changes in 1990.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=42xPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gpADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4203%2C1842747 Colonial street names abolished], [[Reuters]], ''[[New Straits Times]]'', March 8, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Other streets have been named after leaders of neighbouring countries, such as [[Samora Machel]] of [[Mozambique]], [[Julius Nyerere]] of [[Tanzania]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]] of [[Zambia]] and [[Nelson Mandela]] of South Africa. Others have a general pan-African nationalist theme, such as Africa Unity Square in Harare, formerly Cecil Square.

This is a '''list of sites and peoples visited by the [[Hernando de Soto]] Expedition''' in the years 1539–1543. In May 1539, de Soto left [[Havana, Cuba]], with nine ships, over 620 men and 220 surviving horses and landed at [[Port Charlotte, Florida|Charlotte Harbor, Florida]]. This began his three-year odyssey through the Southeastern North American continent, from which de Soto and a large portion of his men would not return. They met many varied [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] groups, most of them bands and chiefdoms related to the widespread [[Mississippian culture]]. Only a few of these cultures survived into the seventeenth century. Others have been recorded only in the written historical accounts of de Soto's expedition.

[[File:LBL Acoustic Positioning System Aquamap Diver.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 1: Method of the operation of a long baseline (LBL) acoustic positioning system]]

A '''long baseline (LBL) acoustic positioning system'''&lt;ref&gt;Underwater Acoustic Positioning Systems, Chapter 4, P.H. Milne, 1983, {{ISBN|0-87201-012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of three broad classes of [[Underwater Acoustic Positioning System|underwater acoustic positioning systems]] that are used to track underwater vehicles and divers. The other two classes are [[Ultra-short baseline|ultra short baseline systems]] (USBL) and [[Short baseline acoustic positioning system|short baseline systems]] (SBL). LBL systems are unique in that they use networks of sea-floor mounted baseline transponders as reference points for navigation. These are generally deployed around the perimeter of a work site. The LBL technique results in very high positioning accuracy and position stability that is independent of water depth.  It is generally better than 1-meter and can reach a few centimeters accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;NOAA Diving Manual, Edition 4, Underwater Navigation, Section 10.2., {{ISBN|0-941332-70-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-941332-70-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; LBL systems are generally employed for precision underwater survey work where the accuracy or position stability of ship-based (SBL, USBL) positioning systems does not suffice.

== Operation and performance ==
[[File:AquaMap Diver LBL Acoustic Positioning Equipment.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Figure 2: A dive team (Envirotech Diving) with their AquaMap LBL acoustic underwater positioning system including three baseline transponders (B) and diver stations (A) mounted on scooters. The baseline stations are first deployed in the corners of a work site. Their relative position is then precisely measured using the AquaMap system's automatic acoustic self-survey capability. For geo-referenced operations, the baseline positions are surveyed by differential GPS or a laser positioning equipment (total station). During a dive, the diver station interrogates the baseline stations to measure the distances, which are then converted to positions.]]

Long baseline systems determine the position of a vehicle or diver by acoustically measuring the distance from a vehicle or diver interrogator to three or more seafloor deployed baseline transponders. These range measurements, which are often supplemented by depth data from pressure sensors on the devices, are then used to triangulate the position of the vehicle or diver.  In figure 1, a diver mounted interrogator (A) sends a signal, which is received by the baseline transponders (B, C, D).  The transponders reply, and the replies are received again by the diver station (A).  Signal run time measurements now yield the distances A-B, A-C and A-D, which are used to compute the diver position by triangulation or position search algorithms.  The resulting positions are relative to the location of the baseline transducers. These can be readily converted to a geo-referenced coordinate system such as latitude/longitude or UTM if the geo-positions of the baseline stations are first established.

Long baseline systems get their name from the fact that the spacing of the baseline transponders is long or similar to the distance between the diver or vehicle and the transponders.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Acoustics, Malcolm J. Crocker 1998, {{ISBN|0-471-25293-X}}, 9780471252931, page 462&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, the baseline transponders are typically mounted in the corners of an underwater work site within which the vehicle or diver operates. This method yields an ideal geometry for positioning, in which any given error in acoustic range measurements produce only about an equivalent position error.&lt;ref&gt;The ROV Manual, Robert D. Christ and Robert L. Wernli Sr, Section 4.2.8. Capabilities and Limitations of Acoustic Positioning, {{ISBN|978-0-7506-8148-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This compares to SBL and USBL systems with shorter baselines where ranging disturbances of a given amount can result in much larger position errors. Further, the mounting of the baseline transponders on the sea floor eliminates the need for converting between reference frames, as is the case for USBL or SBL positioning systems mounted on moving vessels.&lt;ref&gt;The ROV Manual, Section 4.2.6.4 Long Baseline (LBL)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, sea floor mounting makes the positioning accuracy independent of water depth.&lt;ref&gt;LBL Underwater Positioning, Hydro International Magazine, Jan/Feb 2008, Volume 12, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt;  For these reasons LBL systems are generally applied to tasks where the required standard of positioning accuracy or reliability exceeds the capabilities of USBL and SBL systems.

== History ==
The search and inspection of the lost nuclear submarine [[USS Thresher (SSN-593)|USS Thresher]] by the U.S. Navy oceanographic vessel [[USNS Mizar (T-AGOR-11)|USNS Mizar]] in 1963 is frequently credited as the origin of modern underwater acoustic navigation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Milne, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Mizar primarily used a short baseline (SBL) system to track the bathyscaphe [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste 1]].  However, its capability also included seafloor transponders, which in conjunction with early navigation satellites supported station-keeping with a precision of about 300 feet, considered remarkable at the time.&lt;ref&gt;The Universe Below, Page 77, William J. Broad &amp; Dimitry Schidlovski 1998, {{ISBN|0-684-83852-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-684-83852-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Ohio-class submarine launches Tomahawk Cruise missiles (artist concept).jpg|thumb|right|Figure 3: Precisely establishing the position of nuclear submarines prior to missile launches was an early application of long baseline acoustic positioning systems. Covert networks of sea floor transponders could survive and provide a precision navigation capability even after GPS satellites had been knocked out.]]

By the mid-1960s and possibly earlier, the Soviets were developing underwater navigation systems including seafloor transponders to allow nuclear submarines to operate precisely while staying submerged.&lt;ref&gt;History of Russian Underwater Acoustics, page 722. Oleg A. Godin, David R. Palmer, 2008, {{ISBN|981-256-825-5}}, {{ISBN|978-981-256-825-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides navigating through canyons and other difficult underwater terrain, there was also a need to establish the position of the submarine prior to the launch of a nuclear missile (ICBM).  In 1981, acoustic positioning was proposed as part of the U.S. military's [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX missile]] system.&lt;ref&gt;MX Missile Basing, pages 173-175, 1981, {{ISBN|1-4289-2450-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4289-2450-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A network of 150 covert transponder fields was envisioned.  Submarines typically are guided by inertial navigation systems, but these dead reckoning systems develop position drift which must be corrected by occasional position fixes from a GNSS system.  If the enemy were to knock out the GNSS satellites, the submarine could rely on the covert transponder network to establish its position and program the missile's own inertial navigation system for launch.

'''Loxodromic navigation''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''λοξóς'', oblique, and ''δρóμος'', path) is a method of navigation by following a [[rhumb line]], a curve on the surface of the [[Earth (planet)|Earth]] that follows the same angle at the intersection with each [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]]. This serves to maintain a steady course in sailing.&lt;ref name="WeintritNeumann2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adam Weintrit|author2=Tomasz Neumann|title=Methods and Algorithms in Navigation: Marine Navigation and Safety of Sea Transportation|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=buMsPGyE7boC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=loxodromic+navigation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GIZeu8DBp5&amp;sig=1UcvzLLnZjKTSpaS9ECPnMmpidU&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBWoVChMIq9ztmPzSyAIViXEUCh03eAKe#v=onepage&amp;q=loxodromic%20navigation&amp;f=false|date=7 June 2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-415-69114-7|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Navigating on a spherical surface with a fixed [[course (navigation)|course]] (&lt;math&gt;\beta &lt;/math&gt; in the figure) results in a spiral path that approaches the [[North Pole]] for courses ranging from 270º to 090º and the [[South Pole]] for courses from 090º to 270º. On a [[nautical chart]] plotted according to the [[Mercator projection]], a loxodromic course appears as a straight line.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5158">Whereas originally the term [[Navigation]] applies to the process of directing a ship to a destination, '''Navigation research''' deals with fundamental aspects of navigation in general. It can be defined as "The process of determining and maintaining a course or trajectory to a goal location" (Franz, Mallot, 2000).
It concerns basically all moving [[Agent (grammar)|agents]], [[biology|biological]] or artificial, [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] or remote-controlled.

Franz and Mallot proposed a navigation hierarchy in ''Robotics and Autonomous Systems 30'' (2006):&lt;ref name=FM1&gt;{{cite book|author=Franz|author2=Mallot|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V16-3YHG97R-K&amp;_user=946230&amp;_coverDate=01%2F31%2F2000&amp;_rdoc=9&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=%23toc%235666%232000%23999699998%23159597!&amp;_cdi=5666&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_acct=C000049009&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=946230&amp;md5=8c30c4f00f8e97c08651032b4d118e90|title=Robotics and Autonomous Systems 30|year=2000|pages=133–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic methods for navigation:

* [[Egocentric navigation]] also known as Idiothetic navigation
* [[Allocentric navigation]] also known as Allothetic navigation

== Human navigation==
In human navigation people visualize different routes in their minds to plan how to get from one place to another. The things which they rely on to plan these routes vary from person to person and are the basis of the differing navigational strategies.
  
Some people use measures of distance and absolute directional terms (north, south, east, and west) in order to visualize the best pathway from point to point. The use of these more general, external cues as directions is considered part of an allocentric navigation strategy. [[Allocentric navigation]] is typically seen in males and is beneficial primarily in large and/or unfamiliar environments.&lt;ref name= "one"&gt;Andreano &amp; Cahill (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; This likely has some basis in evolution when males would have to navigate through large and unfamiliar environments while hunting.&lt;ref name= "two"&gt;Geary (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of allocentric strategies when navigating primarily activates the hippocampus and parahippocampus in the brain. This navigation strategy relies more on a mental, spatial map than visible cues, giving it an advantage in unknown areas but a flexibility to be used in smaller environments as well. The fact that it is mainly males that favor this strategy is likely related to the generalization that males are better navigators than females as it is better able to be applied in a greater variety of settings.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

[[Egocentric navigation]] relies on more local landmarks and personal directions (left/right) to navigate and visualize a pathway. This reliance on more local and well-known stimuli for finding their way makes it difficult to apply in new locations, but is instead most effective in smaller, familiar environments.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Evolutionarily, egocentric navigation likely comes from our ancestors who would forage for their food and need to be able to return to the same places daily to find edible plants. This foraging usually occurred in relatively nearby areas and was most commonly done by the females in hunter-gatherer societies.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Females, today, are typically better at knowing where various landmarks are and often rely on them when giving directions. Egocentric navigation causes high levels of activation in the right parietal lobe and prefrontal regions of the brain that are involved in visuospatial processing.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

== Robotic navigation ==
{{Main|Robotic navigation}}
[[Outdoor]] robots can use GPS in a similar way to [[automotive navigation system]]s.
Alternative systems can be used with [[floor plan]] instead of [[map]]s for [[indoor]] robots, combined with localization wireless hardware.

Located about {{convert|3|km}} east of the central business district, '''Osu''' is a neighborhood in central [[Accra]], [[Ghana]], known for its busy commercial, restaurant and nightlife activity. It is locally known as the "West End" of Accra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travel-to-discover-ghana.com/osu-oxford-street.html Osu Oxford Street] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205173118/http://www.travel-to-discover-ghana.com/osu-oxford-street.html |date=2015-02-05 }}. traveltodiscoverghana.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Bounded to the south by the Gulf of Guinea, Osu's western boundary is the Independence Avenue. Ring Road separates Osu from the northern district of [[Labone, Accra|Labone]].

Owing to its establishment as a settlement around the Danish fort of [[Osu Castle|Christiansborg]] in the 17th century, Osu offers a mix of houses dating from the early 20th century (both low-rise apartment blocks and detached houses) to modern office towers. Ringway Estates, a [[gated community|gated residential community]] between Gamel Abdul Nasser Avenue and Cantonments Road is located in the western section of Osu.

The main thoroughfare, Cantonments Road (colloquially known as Oxford Street) features large supermarkets and appliance shops, and is renowned for its food joints and lively nightlife. At its southern end is the site of the 17th-century [[Osu Castle|Fort Christiansborg]], a former [[Danish Gold Coast|Danish colonial]] fort, which formerly housed the seat of government, and relocated to [[The Flagstaff House]] near the 37 Military Hospital after it was reconstructed by Former President, [[John Kufuor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://accra.wantedinafrica.com/area_description.php?id_area=354 Accra Medium Area: Labone/Osu (Christianborg)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811025541/http://accra.wantedinafrica.com/area_description.php?id_area=354 |date=2011-08-11 }}. accra.wantedinafrica.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Osu-RE==
Osu-RE located on "Oxford Street" is arguably the liveliest part of Accra and Ghana as a whole, the most preferred hang-out spot for tourists visiting the city. With most of the country's entertaining places located in the Osu-Re, the town hosts people with diverse cultures and entertainment from different countries.

The [[Shackleton–Rowett Expedition]], 1921–22, was the last Antarctic expedition led by Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]. Proposed as an ambitious two-year programme of Antarctic exploration it was curtailed by the death of Shackleton and the inadequacies of the expedition's ship, ''[[Quest (ship)|Quest]]''. Under the command of [[Frank Wild]] several attempts were made to break through the Antarctic pack ice, but the expedition was never able to proceed further than [[longitude]] 20°E. On the crew's return to [[Cape Town]] to refit in preparation for the second term they were ordered home. The crew of the ''Quest'' comprised 24 members in all, but only 19 were on board for the start of the Antarctic portion (Hussey accompanied Shackleton's body when it was put on board a ship for England, and Eriksen, Mooney and Bee-Mason had left before the ship reached [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]). Gerald Lysaght, a yachtsman, accompanied the crew from [[Plymouth]] to [[Cape Verde]].

[[Administrative division|Administratively]], '''[[Cuba]]''' is divided into 15 '''provinces''' and a special [[municipality]] that's not included in any province. The last modification was approved in August 2010 (by the Cuban National Assembly), splitting Havana province into two new provinces: [[Artemisa Province|Artemisa]] (which incorporates the three eastern municipalities of the neighbour [[Pinar del Río]]) and [[Mayabeque Province|Mayabeque]]. The new provinces started functioning from January 1, 2011. Havana City Province ([[Ciudad de La Habana]]) recovered its original name: [[La Habana]] (Havana in [[English language|English]]).

== List of provinces ==

From west to east, Cuba's provinces are:
# [[Pinar del Río Province|Pinar del Río]]
# [[Artemisa Province|Artemisa]]
# [[Havana]]
# [[Mayabeque Province|Mayabeque]]
# [[Matanzas Province|Matanzas]]
# [[Cienfuegos Province|Cienfuegos]]
# [[Villa Clara Province|Villa Clara]]
# [[Sancti Spíritus Province|Sancti Spíritus]]
# [[Ciego de Ávila Province|Ciego de Ávila]]
# [[Camagüey Province|Camagüey]]
# [[Las Tunas Province|Las Tunas]]
# [[Granma Province|Granma]]
# [[Holguín Province|Holguín]]
# [[Santiago de Cuba Province|Santiago de Cuba]]
# [[Guantánamo Province|Guantánamo]]
# [[Isla de la Juventud]] is a "special municipality".  Isla de la Juventud ("Island of Youth") was known until the 1970s as the ''Isla de Pinos'' ("Isle of Pines").

== History ==
[[File:Cuba_Map_Colors_ProvinciasRev_wNumbs.jpg|thumb|Cuban Provinces 1879 to 1976]]

The provinces were created in 1879 by the Spanish colonial government. From 1879 to 1976, Cuba was divided into 6 provinces, which maintained with little changes the same boundaries and capital cities, although with modifications in official names. These "historical" provinces are the following (from west to east):
# Pinar del Río
# La Habana, included the city of [[Havana]], current [[Mayabeque Province|Mayabeque]], some municipalities of current [[Artemisa Province]] (prior to 1970: 5 municipalities; from 1970 to 2011, 8 municipalities, including [[Artemisa]] city itself). &lt;br /&gt;The Isle of Pines (currently named "Isle of Youth") was considered a "special municipality" in The Province of La Habana.
# Matanzas
# Las Villas (before 1940 named "[[Santa Clara Province|Santa Clara]]"), contained the present-day provinces of [[Cienfuegos Province|Cienfuegos]], [[Villa Clara Province|Villa Clara]], [[Sancti Spíritus Province|Sancti Spíritus]], and Southern [[Matanzas]] Province.
# Camagüey (before 1899 named "Puerto Príncipe"), contained the present-day provinces of [[Camagüey Province|Camagüey]] and [[Ciego de Ávila Province|Ciego de Ávila]], as well as two municipalities of current [[Las Tunas Province]] (prior to 1970).
# [[Oriente Province|Oriente]] (before 1905 named "Santiago de Cuba"), contained the present-day provinces of [[Las Tunas Province|Las Tunas]], [[Granma Province|Granma]], [[Holguín Province|Holguín]], [[Santiago de Cuba Province|Santiago de Cuba]] and [[Guantánamo Province|Guantánamo]]

The federal law requires states to have a minimum age of 18 years for sale/purchase of tobacco products (21 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;387f. (3)(a)(ii)). State and local laws may extend this ban and also prohibit supply, possession and consumption to/by person underage, or increase the age beyond 18. However, most states do not directly ban the consumption of tobacco by a minor. The federal law requiring states to have a minimum purchasing age at 18 is enforced by withholding [[FEMA]] disaster and non-disaster grants from states that have purchasing ages under 18, and currently no state falls under that category.

In addition, the store involved will have the tobacco license suspended for 6 months at the first offense, and permanently revoked for the second offense. However, if the store involved is caught selling to minors in school uniform, or to minors below the age of 12, the tobacco license will be permanently revoked even at its first offense.

'''Stac an Armin''' ([[Scottish Gaelic Language|Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Stac an Àrmainn''), based on the proper [[Scottish Gaelic]] spelling (formerly ''àrmuinn''), is a [[sea stack]] in the [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]] [[archipelago]].

The name Stac an Armin means stack of the soldier/warrior, and evidence remains showing it was used by people living nearby as a hunting grounds. It is not believed to have been inhabited year round, but has hosted some (involuntary) extended stays. Climbing the rocks was once done to collect eggs and has continued in the form of recreational sport. The island was once home to the now extinct [[great auk]], and rules exist to protect the bird habitats and breeding grounds.

Stac an Armin is 400 metres (¼&amp;nbsp;mi) north of [[Boreray, St Kilda|Boreray]] and near the 172-metre-high (564&amp;nbsp;ft) [[Stac Lee]]. Stac an Armin is separated from Boreray by a channel "so littered with rocks" that it should not be sailed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Haswell-Smith| first = Hamish| title = An Island Odyssey: Among the Scottish Isles in the Wake of Martin Martin| publisher = Canongate U.S.| date = 2000| location = | page = 87| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ShLgV4xwBEEC| isbn = 978-1-84195-082-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though sailors write passionately about the views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Nicolson| first = Adam| title = Seamanship: A Voyage Along the Wild Coasts of the British Isles| publisher = HarperCollins| date = 2005| location = | page = 134| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wbw1UN6EiSgC| isbn = 978-0-06-075342-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and people==
The first written account of the island was [[Martin Martin]]'s description in the early 18th century. Martin wrote about the island after the Scottish writer had visited St Kilda in 1697 and included a few anecdotes about the stack in his ''A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland'' published in 1703. It was the first comprehensive book on the [[archipelago]], to which was appended "A Late Voyage to St Kilda". Martin calls the island "Stack-Narmin."&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;"A Late Voyage to St. Kilda," chapter 2, in {{cite book| last = Martin| first = Martin| editor = Donald J. Macleod| title = A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland (circa 1695)| publisher = | location = | pages = | url = http://www.appins.org/martin.htm| isbn = | deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070313003106/http://www.appins.org/martin.htm| archivedate = 2007-03-13| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was never inhabited full-time, but hunting its bird population helped sustain the way of life of the population of St Kilda, as evidenced by the buildings they left behind. There are no fewer than 78 storage [[St Kilda, Scotland#Prehistoric buildings|cleitean]] on Stac an Armin and a small [[bothy]], built by the St Kildans. Martin describes these cleitean as "pyramids" and wrote they were used to "preserve and dry" birds, especially the "solan goose" ([[northern gannet]]). Martin observed one harvest that brought in 800 birds.&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; In addition to the geese, the islanders used Stac an Armin for harvesting [[great auk]]s, [[gannet]]s, and [[puffin]]s, as well as their eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The longest recorded period anyone ever spent on the island was about nine months. Three men and eight boys from [[Hirta]] were marooned here from about 15 August 1727 until 13 May 1728. As luck would have it, Hirta suffered a [[smallpox]] outbreak while the eleven were on the stack, and thus the islanders were unable to man a boat and retrieve them until the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

They survived by fishing, and communicated to their wives that they were alive and well by lighting "as many fires on the top of an eminence as there were men in number." Martin adds, curiously, that the wives were so overjoyed that they managed to produce a record harvest of corn that year.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt;

The archipelago as a whole was [[St Kilda, Scotland#Evacuation|evacuated in 1930]], and bequeathed to the [[National Trust for Scotland]] in 1957. Hunting birds is no longer allowed, and the stack is visited only occasionally by scientists, journalists and climbers.

==The last great auk in Britain==
[[File:greatauk-london.jpg|thumb|right|Mounted great auk, [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London]]

On Stac an Armin, in July, 1840, the last [[great auk]] (''Pinguinus impennis'') seen in Britain&lt;ref&gt;Rackwitz, ''Travels to Terra Incognito'', 347.&lt;/ref&gt; was caught and killed. A then 75-yr. old inhabitant of St Kilda told Henry Evans, a frequent visitor to the archipelago, that he and his father-in-law with another man had caught a "garefowl," noticing its little wings and the large white spot on its head. They tied it up and kept it alive for three days, and then killed it by beating it with a stick, apparently because they believed it to be a witch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Climbing the stack==
Native St Kildans have climbed Stac an Armin and other cliffs in St Kilda for centuries in order to harvest birds and eggs; they climbed [[Alpine style|alpine-style]], barefoot or in thick socks, using ropes pleated of horse hair.&lt;ref name="plan102"&gt;{{cite book

Climbing Stac an Armin (and [[Stac Lee]]), though attractive ("St Kilda presents some of the most challenging climbing in Britain"&lt;ref name="mcos"/&gt;) is complicated by a number of factors. The climb of Stac an Armin itself is described as "little easier than Stac Lee," but the topography makes it a "major expedition" and "the weather can make nonsense of any landing plans."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dawson, "St Kilda (25)"&lt;/ref&gt; The stack is accessible only with difficulty;&lt;ref&gt;"Landing on Stac an Armin is the difficulty, in this case, as the climb itself is reported to be straightforward." ''St Kilda Management Plan 2003–2008'', 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"I doubt if many in the Marhofn 1000-up club will ever climb Stac an Armin or Stac Lee, unless helicopter-assisted." {{cite journal| last =Brown| first =Hamish| authorlink =| title =Letter to the Editor| journal =The Angry Corrie: Scotland's Heritage Hillzine| volume =55| issue =| pages =| publisher =| location =| date =Oct–Nov 2002| url =http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tac/tac55/letteryo.htm| issn =| doi =| id =| accessdate =2009-02-06| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120204075117/http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tac/tac55/letteryo.htm| archivedate =2012-02-04| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; more importantly, since the entire archipelago is both a [[National Nature Reserves in Scotland|National Nature Reserve]] and a [[World Heritage Site]] (principally for the cliffs and seabird colonies&lt;ref&gt;''St Kilda Management Plan 2003–2008'', 10. See also p. 66, "It was placed on the World Heritage List in 1986 for its natural characteristics only."&lt;/ref&gt;) managed by [[Scottish Natural Heritage]] (SNH), climbing is strictly regulated since it potentially disturbs the natural and cultural heritage and particularly the rich birdlife; according to the 2003 Management Plan, "For natural heritage interests, natural processes will normally be allowed to continue without intervention."&lt;ref&gt;''St Kilda Management Plan 2003–2008'', 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Kilda map.png|thumb|left|The St Kilda archipelago]]
The 2003 Management Plan is quite specific about the dangers of climbing in St Kilda: the object of prescription 21.5 is to "Ensure that breeding seabirds are not disturbed by climbing on the cliffs,"&lt;ref&gt;''St Kilda Management Plan 2003–2008'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt; though the Plan suggests the allowance of climbing the cliffs under strictly monitored circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;"St Kilda’s sea cliffs are the highest in the UK and thus offer an attractive challenge to modern day climbers. However, climbing on the sea stacs and cliffs causes disturbance to nesting seabirds and for that reason special permission is required from the Trust and SNH under the terms of the St Kilda bylaws." ''St Kilda Management Plan 2003–2008'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Prescription 26.4 states that a policy that satisfies climbers and does not violate the Trust's mission is to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;"Develop a policy on climbing on St Kilda that ensures rock climbing does not in any way interfere with breeding seabirds, vegetated sea cliffs or wild land quality." ''St Kilda Management Plan 2003–2008'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust's strict but preliminary position on climbing was formalized quite explicitly: {{quote|Given the difficulty of the climbs, the lack of any rescue or medical facilities on St Kilda and the risk of disturbance to nesting bird on the cliffs, climbing on St Kilda is not permitted without the express permission of the Trust. This is stated formally under the St Kilda Bylaws (No 10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''TanSat''', also known as '''CarbonSat''', is a Chinese [[Earth observation satellite]] dedicated to monitoring [[carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere]]. It is generally classified as a [[Small satellite#Small satellites|minisatellite]], and is the first dedicated carbon mission of the [[Chinese space program]].&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt; The mission was formally proposed in 2010, and work began in January 2011.&lt;ref name="nasasf20161221" /&gt; It is funded by the [[Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Science and Technology]] (MOST) and was built by the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences|Shanghai Institute of Microsystem And Information Technology]] (SIMIT).&lt;ref name="nasasf20161221" /&gt;

TanSat carries two instruments: the Carbon Dioxide Spectrometer and the Cloud and Aerosol Polarimetry Imager. The Carbon Dioxide Spectrometer (CDS), also called CarbonSpec, is a high-resolution [[diffraction grating|grating]] [[spectrometer]] which measures {{chem2|CO2}} [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] at 1.61&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] and 2.06&amp;nbsp;µm, and {{chem2|O2}} absorption in reflected sunlight at 0.76&amp;nbsp;µm. The Cloud and Aerosol Polarimetry Imager (CAPI) is a wide-field, moderate-resolution, [[imaging spectrometer]] which works in concert with CDS by compensating for measurement errors caused by clouds and [[aerosol]]s. It makes observations in ultraviolet (0.38&amp;nbsp;µm), visible (0.67&amp;nbsp;µm), and near infrared (0.87&amp;nbsp;µm, 1.375&amp;nbsp;µm, and 1.64&amp;nbsp;µm).&lt;ref name="sfinsider20161221"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/china-national-space-administration/long-march-2d-launches-china-tansat-carbon-monitoring-satellite/ |title=Long March 2D launches China’s TanSat carbon-monitoring satellite |work=Spaceflight Insider |first=Tomasz |last=Nowakowski |date=21 December 2016 |accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2001">'''Valley of [[Rephaite|Rephaim]]''' ({{lang-he|עמק רפאים}}, ''Emeq Rephaim'')- ({{bibleverse||Joshua|15:8|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Joshua|18:16|NIV}}, R.V.). A valley descending southwest from [[Emek Refaim|Jerusalem]] to the [[Valley of Elah]] below, it is an ancient route from the coastal plain to the [[Judean Hills]], probably named after the legendary race of giants.

==Biblical story==
When [[David]] became king over all [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Israel]], the [[Philistines]], judging that he would now become their uncompromising enemy, made a sudden attack upon [[Hebron]], compelling David to retire from it. He sought refuge in "the hold" at [[Adullam]] ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|5:17-22|NIV}}), and the [[Philistines]] took up their position in the valley of [[Rephaim]], on the west and south-west of [[Jerusalem]]. Thus all communication between [[Bethlehem]] and Jerusalem was intercepted. While David and his army were encamped here, there occurred that incident narrated in {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|5:17-25|NIV}}. Having obtained divine direction, David led his army against the Philistines, and gained a complete victory over them. The scene of this victory was afterwards called [[Baal-perazim]].

A second time, however, the Philistines rallied their forces in this valley ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|5:22|NIV}}). Again, warned by a divine saying about hearing a marching sound in the tops of the baka trees (הבכאים, KJV "mulberry trees", most modern versions "balsam"), David led his army to [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]], and attacked the Philistines from the south, inflicting on them another severe defeat, and chasing
them with great slaughter to [[Gezer]] (q.v.). There David kept in check these enemies of Israel.
