== Early life ==
Abdullah was born in the second district of [[Kabul]] in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="khaama"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dr. Abdullah Abdullah |date=26 Sep 2010 |publisher=www.khaama.com |quote=Fifty years ago I was born in the second district of Karte Parwan in Kabul in the same house where I reside today.

I have seven sisters and two brother.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early years were split between living in [[Panjshir Province]], and Kabul, where his father was serving as an administrator in the land survey, and subsequently the audit section of the Prime Minister's office. He is the son of a [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] father from the [[Kandahar]] area, Clan Noorzai, and a [[Tajik people|Tajik]] mother from the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6018945/Afghan-election-Hamid-Karzais-rival-Abdullah-Abdullah-crosses-ethnic-divide.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Afghan election: Hamid Karzai's rival Abdullah Abdullah crosses ethnic divide |first=Ben |last=Farmer |date=August 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Poll shows Afghan vote headed for second round |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE57D0SE20090814 |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has seven sisters and two brothers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nca.af/Dr-Abdullah-Abdullah-In-His-Own-Words-f2013124829.html|title = Dr. Abdullah Abdullah: In His Own Words|date = |accessdate = October 20, 2014|website = National Coalition of Afghanistan|publisher = |last = Abdullah|first = Abdullah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until he became a government minister, Abdullah had [[mononymous person|only a first name]]; demands from Western newspaper editors for a [[family name]] led him to adopt the full name "Abdullah Abdullah".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Filkins|first=Dexter|title=The Forever War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0rAXFBk8MCoC|year=2008|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-27034-4}}, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Abdullah is married, and has three daughters and a son.

== Education and medical career==
Abdullah graduated from Naderia High School in 1976. Then he went on to study ophthalmology at Kabul's University Department of Medicine where he received an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]] in 1983. From '84 to '85 he served as a resident ophthalmologist at N'oor Institute in Kabul. During the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[Communism|communist]] [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] government from 1985 to 1986 he worked in the [[ophthalmology|veterinary]]  hospital for Animals  in Peshawar.&lt;ref name="The Transition to Democracy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/5105/transition_to_democracy_in_afghanistan_and_the_challenges_ahead.html?breadcrumb=%2Feducators%2Fmultimedia%3Fgroupby%3D3%26filter%3D2002%26page%3D2 |title=The Transition to Democracy in Afghanistan and the Challenges Ahead |date=October 17, 2002 |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |accessdate=2009-05-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517050256/http://www.cfr.org/publication/5105/transition_to_democracy_in_afghanistan_and_the_challenges_ahead.html?breadcrumb=%2Feducators%2Fmultimedia%3Fgroupby%3D3&amp;filter=2002&amp;page=2 |archivedate=2009-05-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==

===Soviet war in Afghanistan===
{{main article|Soviet–Afghan War}}

In September 1985, Abdullah became the head of the Health Department for the Panjshir Resistance Front, coordinating treatments and health care for the resistance fighters and the civilian population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He became a close associate and adviser to [[mujahideen]] commander [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] in the [[Soviet–Afghan War]].&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1672882.stm|title=Profile: Abdullah Abdullah|date=22 March 2006|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-05-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090512185350/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1672882.stm| archivedate= 12 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic State of Afghanistan===
{{main article|Islamic State of Afghanistan|3=Peshawar Accord}}

After the fall of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|communist government]] in 1992, the [[Peshawar Accord]] established the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] with a [[provisional government]] led by [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]]. Abdullah was appointed [[chief of staff]] and spokesperson of the [[Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Defense]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===United Islamic Front===
{{main article|Northern Alliance|3 = Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan}}On September 27, 1996, the [[Taliban]] seized power in Kabul and 90% of the country with military training support by [[Pakistan]] and established the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Coll, ''Ghost Wars'' (New York: Penguin, 2005), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Following the capture of Kabul by the [[Taliban]], the [[Northern Alliance]] was created under the leadership of Ahmad Shah Massoud, The NA was supported by Russia, Iran and India. Dr. Abdullah became the United Front's Minister of Foreign Affairs. [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] elements of the United Front, including the Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah, remained Afghanistan's internationally recognized government. The Taliban government was recognized by only three countries - Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.

In early 2001 Abdullah traveled with Ahmad Shah Massoud to Brussels where Massoud addressed the [[European Parliament]] asking the [[international community]] to provide humanitarian help to the people of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="EU Parliament (2)"&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t78N6Q5VD60|title = Massoud in the European Parliament 2001| publisher = EU media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Abdullah translated when Massoud stated that the Taliban and [[al-Qaeda]] had introduced "a very wrong perception of Islam" and that without the support of Pakistan and [[Osama bin Laden|Bin Laden]], the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.&lt;ref name="EU Parliament (2)"/&gt;

===Foreign ministry===
[[File:Ghani-Ahady-Abdullah-2009.jpg|thumb|From left to right: [[Ashraf Ghani]], [[Anwar ul-Haq Ahady]], and Abdullah. (April 2009)]]

In October 2001 the Taliban regime was overthrown by [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] including American and [[Northern Alliance|United Front]] forces. As a result of the [[International Conference on Afghanistan, Bonn (2001)|International Conference on Afghanistan]] in Bonn in 2001, Abdullah was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Interim Administration in December 2001.

Following the [[Afghan presidential election, 2004]], Abdullah was one of the few people who kept their position from the Transitional Government and was re-appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs for another year. In 2005 he resigned his position.&lt;ref name="new cabinet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pakistantimes.net/2004/12/24/top5.htm |title=Afghan President Karzai appoints new cabinet |date=24 December 2004 |work=Pakistan Times |accessdate=2009-05-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517044236/http://pakistantimes.net/2004/12/24/top5.htm |archivedate=17 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 presidential election ===
On May 6, 2009, Abdullah registered as an Independent candidate for the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|2009 Afghan presidential election]], running against incumbent president [[Hamid Karzai]]. Abdullah selected as his running mates Humayun Shah Asefi as his First Vice President and Dr. Cheragh Ali Cheragh (a surgeon from Kabul who is a practicing [[Shia Islam|Shi'i Muslim]]) as Second Vice President. Afghanistan has an [[Executive (government)|executive structure]] featuring two [[vice president]]s, a First VP and a Second VP, to help ensure a stable government by attempting to provide ethnic and religious balance to senior government leadership positions. Unofficial and non-certified electoral results were announced during the day on September 16, 2009, showing that Abdullah was in second position with 27.8% of the total votes cast. President Karzai did not achieve the 50.01% vote majority required to avoid a runoff election. A large number of fraudulent ballots, mostly belonging to Karzai's camp, were disallowed by the Independent Afghan Electoral Commission. Karzai came under intense international political and diplomatic pressure from  international leaders because of allegations of large-scale fraud. Hamid Karzai eventually agreed to participate in a designated head-to-head runoff election (held between the contenders with the two largest numbers of total votes in the first election) which was scheduled nationwide for November 7, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1925090,00.html?xid=rss-topstories  | title=Why Karzai's Rival Abdullah Won't Budge on Runoff  | accessdate=2009-09-21  | publisher=Time | date=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2009, Abdullah announced that he had decided to withdraw from the runoff election, citing his lack of faith in the President Karzai government's ability to hold a "fair and transparent" second election process. Subsequently, Hamid Karzai was declared the winner by the Afghan Electoral Commission (essentially winning by default).

===National Coalition of Afghanistan===

After the 2009 Afghan Presidential Elections, Abdullah created the Coalition for Change and Hope (CCH). The NCA presented the leading democratic opposition movement against the government of Hamid Karzai.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khaama Press"/&gt;

In the September 18, 2010 parliamentary election, the Coalition for Change and Hope won more than 90 seats out of 249 seats, becoming the main opposition party.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khaama Press"/&gt; As a result, it is assumed that the new Parliament will introduce some checks and balances on the Presidential power.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khaama Press"/&gt;

Regarding the [[Taliban]] insurgency and Karzai's strategy of negotiations Dr. Abdullah stated:
{{quote|I should say that Taliban are not fighting in order to be accommodated. They are fighting in order to bring the state down. So it's a futile exercise, and it's just misleading. ... There are groups that will fight to the death. Whether we like to talk to them or we don't like to talk to them, they will continue to fight. So, for them, I don't think that we have a way forward with talks or negotiations or contacts or anything as such. Then we have to be prepared to tackle and deal with them militarily. In terms of the Taliban on the ground, there are lots of possibilities and opportunities that with the help of the people in different parts of the country, we can attract them to the peace process; provided, we create a favorable environment on this side of the line.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio (NPR)"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130757482| work=National Public Radio (NPR)| accessdate= | title=Abdullah Abdullah: Talks With Taliban Futile | first=| last=| date=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In December 2011, the [[National Coalition of Afghanistan]], supported by dozens of Afghan political parties and led by Abdullah, was formed to challenge the government of President Hamid Karzai. Major figures associated with the coalition include [[Yunus Qanuni]] (the former head of the Afghan Parliament), Homayoon Shah-asefi (a former presidential candidate and leader of the monarchist party with ties to the family of former king Mohammed Zahir, Noorolhagh Oloumi (a senior political figure in the former Afghan communist government), [[Ahmad Wali Massoud]] (a younger brother of [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]]) and several current Members of Parliament.&lt;ref name="Eurasia Review"/&gt;

===Massoud Foundation===
Abdullah has been the Secretary General of the Massoud Foundation since June 2006. The Massoud Foundation is an independent, non-aligned, non-profitable and non-political organization established by people who have been affected by the life of Massoud. It provides humanitarian assistance to Afghans especially in the fields of health care and education. It also runs programs in the fields of culture, construction, agriculture and welfare.

===2014 presidential candidacy===
[[File:2017 Halifax International Security Forum (37618951885).jpg|thumb|Abdullah at the [[Halifax International Security Forum]] 2017 ]]
{{Further information|Afghan presidential election, 2014}}
On 1 October 2013, Abdullah officially announced his nomination for the [[Afghan presidential election, 2014|presidential election]] held on 5 April 2014. On 13 April, BBC News reported that the counting indicated that Abdullah had thus far received 44.65% of the vote, with [[Ashraf Ghani]] following behind with 33.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-27009936| title=Afghan poll: Abdullah slightly ahead as count continues| date=April 13, 2014| accessdate=April 23, 2014| publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdullah and Ghani were then bound to compete in a [[run-off election]] in June 2014.&lt;ref name=Nordland&gt;{{cite news|last=Nordland|first=Rod|title=Afghan Voters Signaling a Turn|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/world/asia/afghanistan-elections.html|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of that election remained in dispute through until September 2014, with Abdullah claiming the government and the national electoral institutions manipulated the results. Pressure from the United States on the two candidates to resolve their differences, and to negotiate a power-sharing deal were initially agreed to, but Abdullah later remained defiant. A UN-led audit failed to sway Abdullah as he insisted the audit team could not explain a million extra votes counted in the run-off. Ghani supporters insisted they wanted to do a deal with Abdullah, and said they were leaving the door open to negotiations.&lt;ref name="AbdullahDefiant"&gt;{{cite news|title=Abdullah insists he has won and refuses to accept vote audit|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/afghanistan-presidential-vote/26572385.html|date=8 September 2014|accessdate=9 September 2014|publisher=''Radio Free Europe''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, the [[Independent Election Commission]] announced Ghani the winner.&lt;ref name=RNordland&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nordland|first1=Rod|title=Ashraf Ghani Is Named President of Afghanistan by Elections Panel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/world/asia/afghan-presidential-election.html?_r=0|accessdate=21 September 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five hours later, Abdullah and Ghani signed a power-sharing agreement, with Ghani being named president and Abdullah taking on an important position in the government; the deal was signed in front of the presidential palace, with incumbent president Hamid Karzai in attendance.&lt;ref name=RNordland/&gt; Part of the deal stipulated that the Independent Election Commission would not release the exact vote totals of the second round of voting.&lt;ref name=RNordland/&gt;

Paroled in 1999, Fisher became a writer and a [[pornographic film actor|pornographic actress]].

==Early life==
Fisher was born in [[Merrick, New York|Merrick]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on [[Long Island]],&lt;ref name=biography.com /&gt; to Elliot and Roseann Fisher;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/12/nyregion/hidden-haunted-behind-headlines-parents-accused-long-island-teen-ager-are.html?pagewanted=all|title=Hidden and Haunted Behind the Headlines; Parents of an Accused Long Island Teen-Ager Are Prisoners of Sensation-Seekers| first=Diana Jean|last= Schemo|work=[[The New York Times]]| date=June 12, 1992|accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; her father was [[Jews|Jewish]] while her mother's family, Fisher said, was "a mixture of a lot of different things, including English."&lt;ref&gt;In ''My Story'', Fisher says her maternal grandfather "wasn't Italian, he was a mixture of a lot of different things, including English."&lt;/ref&gt; As a 16-year-old student at [[John F. Kennedy High School (Bellmore, New York)|Kennedy High School]] in [[Bellmore, New York|Bellmore]], New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcbstv.com/classic/Amy.Fisher.Joey.2.235230.html "Classics: 'Long Island Lolita' May 19, 1992"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510021021/http://wcbstv.com/classic/Amy.Fisher.Joey.2.235230.html |date=May 10, 2010 }}, CBSTV.com, May 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher began an allegedly sexual relationship with 35-year-old Joey Buttafuoco, who denied her claim, after damaging the car her parents had given her for her 16th birthday and appealing to Buttafuoco, owner of the body shop to which she took it, to make the repairs without her family knowing of the damage.&lt;ref name="nytimes-admit2"&gt;{{cite news

==Crime and prison==
Fisher gradually fell in love with Joey Buttafuoco and became increasingly jealous of his wife. Eventually the then 17-year-old Fisher shared with Buttafuoco her idea of murdering her.  According to Fisher, Buttafuoco helped her plan the shooting and told her about his wife's habits and when she was usually home.

With the aid of Peter Guagenti, Fisher obtained a .25 caliber pistol and then went out to steal a set of license plates off a neighborhood car. On May 19, 1992, Guagenti helped Fisher put the license plates on his Pontiac Firebird and then drove her to the Buttafuoco home in [[Massapequa, New York|Massapequa]], New York. Fisher later explained to the police that she had expected Guagenti to carry out the shooting, but he refused. When Mary Jo Buttafuoco answered the door, Fisher told her that Joey Buttafuoco was having an affair with Fisher's (imaginary) younger sister, providing a T-shirt advertising Buttafuoco's auto body shop for her "proof." The conversation lasted about 15 minutes, but Buttafuoco became increasingly angry with Fisher's claims. She finally told her to leave and then turned her back to return into the house. Fisher then produced the gun, struck Buttafuoco in the head with it, and then aimed at her temple and fired. Buttafuoco fell to the ground, severely wounded. Fisher dropped the shirt and the gun and ran towards the car, but Guagenti told her to take the evidence with her, so she ran back to retrieve both items and then they both fled the scene. Neighbors called 911 and came to Buttafuoco's aid. She was operated on all night, and although unable to remove the bullet, the doctors were able to save her life.&lt;ref name="trutv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/amy_fisher/index.html|title=Amy Fisher|last=Bell|first=Rachel|publisher=truTV|accessdate=2009-02-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125221246/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/amy_fisher/index.html|archivedate=2009-01-25|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewed by police, Joey Buttafuoco told them that Fisher could be the shooter. Police Detective Martin Alger obtained a photo of Fisher, and when Mary Jo Buttafuoco regained consciousness the next day, she was able to recognize Fisher from the photo. Fisher was arrested and charged with attempted murder, and on September 23, 1992, she pleaded guilty to first-degree assault.

===Paul Makely tape/prostitution===
In September 1992, the tabloid television show ''[[Hard Copy]]'' broadcast a snapped videotaped conversation between Fisher and Paul Makely, the owner of a gym in Massapequa. In the tape, recorded hours before she agreed to the plea in court, Fisher could be seen talking about her future, saying that she wanted to get married to Makely so he could visit her in prison. Fisher explained that her lawyer believed requiring people to be married for such visits was unconstitutional, and that she intended to challenge the law on this matter. Fisher could be seen on the tape saying: "That will keep my name in the press. I want my name in the press. Why? Because I can make a lot of money. I figure if I'm going through all this pain and suffering, I'm getting a Ferrari." Prior to the Paul Makely Tape, Peter de Rosa, 29, secretly recorded Fisher in an act of prostitution with him in March 1992, Fisher was 17 at the time.&lt;ref name="makely-ap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1992/Amy-Fisher-Taped-Saying-She-Deserves-a-Ferrari-for-Pain/id-286c5671b2c5ad992726b84ccdc960b4|title=Amy Fisher Taped Saying She Deserves A Ferrari For Pain|publisher=Associated Press|date=1992-09-25|accessdate=2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="makely-buffalo-sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-09-25/news/1992269122_1_long-island-teen-fisher-buttafuoco|title=Trial of Long Island teen takes strange twists Tape shows Fisher bragging about her notoriety|last= |first= |work=The Baltimore Sun|date=1992-09-25|accessdate=2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="makely-upi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/09/25/Secret-video-tape-Amy-wants-sex-in-prison/8417717393600/ |title=Secret video tape: Amy wants sex in prison|last= |first= |publisher=UPI|date=1992-09-25|accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprisonment===
On December 2, 1992, Fisher was sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison. She served seven years and was granted parole in May 1999 after Supreme Court Judge Ira Wexner vacated her guilty plea and shortened her sentence.&lt;ref name=nyt120292&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/02/nyregion/amy-fisher-gets-a-maximum-of-15-years.html |  title= Amy Fisher Gets a Maximum of 15 Years | first= John T. | last = McQuiston | work = The New York Times | date = December 2, 1992 | accessdate = June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-parole"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9905/06/amy.fisher.02/index.html|title=Amy Fisher, 'Long Island Lolita,' granted parole|date=1999-05-06|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joey Buttafuoco denied having an affair with Fisher. In October 1992, the Nassau County District Attorney stated that Buttafuoco would not be prosecuted. However, in February 1993, the case against him was reopened due to rape charges made by Fisher. She testified against him in court and based on this testimony and hotel receipts (dated before Fisher's 17th birthday) with Buttafuoco's signature on them, Buttafuoco was charged with [[statutory rape]]. Buttafuoco pleaded guilty in October 1993. He served six months in prison.&lt;ref name="cnn-sextape"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/01/04/fisher.tape/index.html?iref=mpstoryview|title=Amy Fisher to promote sex tape with husband|last=Davis|first=Richard|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-02-21 | date=2008-01-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221130225/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/01/04/fisher.tape/index.html?iref=mpstoryview| archivedate= 21 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life after prison==
After her release from prison, Fisher became a [[columnist]] for the ''[[Long Island Press]].'' She dictated a book about her experiences, ''If I Knew Then...,'' to Russell Wolliver, whose transcription of her dictations was published in 2004. In 2003, Fisher married Louis Bellera. The couple had three children before divorcing in 2015.&lt;ref name="theinsider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cm1.theinsider.com/screen/42032_Celebrity_Rehab_Star_Amy_Fisher_I_Need_to_Drink/index.html|title=Amy Fisher: 'I Need to Drink'|last= |first= |work=[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]|accessdate=June 25, 2011|archivedate= July 9, 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110709205414/http://cm1.theinsider.com/screen/42032_Celebrity_Rehab_Star_Amy_Fisher_I_Need_to_Drink/index.html| deadurl=yes|quote='In my private life I'm married...

===Fisher and Buttafuoco revisited===
In 2006, Fisher reunited with Mary Jo Buttafuoco in sessions televised for ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and its spinoff, ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]].'' Fisher said she wanted to heal and move on with her life. However, two years later, she said she felt "no sympathy for Mary Jo",&lt;ref name="fox-sympathy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,330322,00.html |title=Amy Fisher: 'I Feel No Sympathy' for Mary Jo Buttafuoco |date=2008-02-11 |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=2009-02-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125204020/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C330322%2C00.html |archivedate=25 January 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; without giving an explanation. Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco eventually reunited for the first time at the 2006 [[Legends Cup (LFL)|Lingerie Bowl]] for the coin toss.

In May 2007, Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco met for dinner in [[Port Jefferson, New York|Port Jefferson]], [[Long Island]], in what TV producer David Krieff said was an attempt to develop a [[reality-television]] show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://nypost.com/2007/05/17/swingin-in-the-rain-2/ |title=Swingin' in the Rain | first= Ed |last=Robinson|date= May 17, 2007|accessdate= September 13, 2017|work=[[New York Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2007/05/13/amy-joey-set-date-for-love/|title=Amy &amp; Joey Set Date for Love|first=James |last=Fanelli |date=May 13, 2007|accessdate= September 13, 2017|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June and July 2011 Fisher appeared as a cast member in the fifth season of the [[reality-television]] series ''[[Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew]]'', which aired on [[VH1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ward|first= Kate|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/03/03/celebrity-rehab-michael-lohan-amy-fisher-bai-ling/|title='Celebrity Rehab': Michael Lohan, Amy Fisher, Bai Ling join season 5|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date= March 3, 2011|accessdate=September 14, 2017|archivedate= October 23, 2016| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023075122/http://www.ew.com/article/2011/03/03/celebrity-rehab-michael-lohan-amy-fisher-bai-ling|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex tape and adult entertainment career==
[[File:2010 Amy Fisher.jpg|thumb|Fisher in 2010]]
In October 2007, the ''New York Post'' published allegations that Fisher's husband, Lou Bellera, had sold a [[sex tape]] of the couple to [[Red Light District Video]] of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="nypost-sexyvideo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/10292007/news/nationalnews/amys_sexxy_video.htm?CMP=EMC-email_edition&amp;DATE=10292007|title=Amy Fisher's Sexy Video|last=K. Li|first=David|date=2007-10-29|publisher=New York Post|accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red Light District Video published a press release stating that it intended to release a sex video of the couple.&lt;ref name="prnewswire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/10-31-2007/0004694105&amp;EDATE=|title=Red Light District to Distribute Amy Fisher Sex Video|date=2007-10-31|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=2009-02-21|archivedate=2012-12-11|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121211063534/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/red-light-district-to-distribute-amy-fisher-sex-video-58977737.html|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, nude pictures of Fisher from the video were posted at various internet sites, and on November 1, 2007, a teaser clip was released by Red Light District Video that showed a nude Fisher showering and sunbathing. Of note were a tattoo surrounding her navel and a breast augmentation. On November 6, 2007, Fisher sued Red Light District and its owner David Joseph, claiming [[copyright infringement]] and other damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Warren|first=Peter|title=Amy Fisher Files Complaint Against Red Light|work=Adult Video News|date=2007-11-06|url=http://www.avn.com/index.cfm?objectid=1774C5FE-EA1B-906D-E91041E70B2BD3CD|accessdate=2007-11-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071109110327/http://www.avn.com/index.cfm?objectID=1774C5FE-EA1B-906D-E91041E70B2BD3CD| archivedate= November 9, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; But by November 8, 2007, amyfisher.com, a website of whose ownership Fisher had previously fought to win, had begun pointing directly to the Red Light District website.&lt;ref name="lalate-domain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.lalate.com/2007/11/09/amy-fishercom-lalate-news-exclusive-about-amyfisher-domain-name/|title=Amy Fisher.com - lalate news exclusive about AmyFisher domain name|date=2007-11-09|publisher=lalate|accessdate=2009-02-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090107114354/http://news.lalate.com/2007/11/09/amy-fishercom-lalate-news-exclusive-about-amyfisher-domain-name/| archivedate= January 7, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early January 2008, Fisher announced that she had settled with Red Light and agreed to do a related promotional appearance. The same announcement indicated that she and Bellera had reconciled.&lt;ref name="cnn-sextape" /&gt; The promotional appearance took place at Retox in New York City on January 4, 2008.&lt;ref name="nydailynews-ppvspecial"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/01/21/2009-01-21_amy_fisher_stars_in_a_payperview_porn_sp.html|title=Amy Fisher stars in a pay-per-view porn special|last=Boyka|first=Olga|date=2009-01-21|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York City|accessdate=2009-02-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090226092513/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/01/21/2009-01-21_amy_fisher_stars_in_a_payperview_porn_sp.html| archivedate= 26 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clips of the video were played on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]].'' On March 6, 2008, Fisher was a guest on the ''Stern'' show, and one topic of discussion was meant to be her video. But after the first phone call, which was from Mary Jo Buttafuoco's daughter Jessica, Fisher left the show six minutes into her interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2008/03/06/Amy-Fisher-storms-out-of-Howard-Stern-chat/UPI-16351204836978/|title=Amy Fisher storms out of Howard Stern chat|publisher=[[United Press International]]|date=March 6, 2008|archivedate=2012-09-15|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120915051350/http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2008/03/06/Amy-Fisher-storms-out-of-Howard-Stern-chat/UPI-16351204836978/|deadurl=no|access-date=2009-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2647">The '''Ait Atta''' ([[Berber languages|Tamazight]]: ⴰⵢⵜ ⵄⵟⵟⴰ, Ayt Ɛṭṭa) are a large [[Berbers|Berber]] tribal confederation of South eastern [[Morocco]], estimated to number about 130,000 as of 1960.&lt;ref&gt;David Hart, ''The Ait Atta of Southern Morocco'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  They are divided into "five fifths" (''khams khmas''), all said to descend from the forty sons of their common ancestor Dadda Atta: these "fifths" are the Ayt Wallal, Ayt Wahlim, Ayt Isful, Ayt Yazza and Ayt Unbgi.  They speak [[Central Atlas Tamazight]]. ("Aït" has the meaning of "people of" in the [[Tamazight language]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ilahiane, Hsain (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0E8qp_k515oC&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Historical Dictionary of the Berbers (Imazighen)]. Lanham, Md.: Scarecrow Press. page 12. {{ISBN|9780810854529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ait Atta originated as a political entity in the [[Jbel Saghro]] region in the 16th century with the founding of their traditional capital [[Iɣerm Amazdar]].  They subsequently expanded first northwards, becoming rivals of the [[Ait Yafelman]], then southwards, taking control of oases in [[Tafilalt]] and the [[Draa River]].  By the 19th century their raids went as far as [[Touat]] (in modern-day [[Algeria]], then belonging to the Moroccan Empire). They resisted the French entry into Morocco until 1933.

At each tribal level, the head was traditionally elected according to the principles of rotation and complementarity: each lineage took turns to occupy the position, but when it was a particular lineage's turn to hold the office, only members of other lineages could choose the candidate.  In ordinary circumstances, power traditionally rested mainly with local councils of family heads, the ''ajmuɛ'', who decided cases according to customary law, ''izerf''.&lt;ref&gt;see Boum, Aomar (2013) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wcM6AAAAQBAJ&amp;q=izerf#v&amp;q=izerf&amp;f=false ''Memories of Absence: How Muslims Remember Jews in Morocco'']. Palo Alto: Stanford University Press. page 39. {{ISBN|9780804788519}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the oases they conquered, the Ait Atta originally dominated a stratified society, where the ''[[haratin]]'' who worked the land were often forbidden from owning it, and needed a protection agreement with an Ait Atta patron; this stratification has considerably receded since Moroccan independence with the establishment of legal equality.

The '''Batin''' are a sub-group of [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] people that inhabits the interior parts of [[Jambi province]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elsbeth Locher-Scholten|title=Sumatran Sultanate and Colonial State: Jambi and the Rise of Dutch Imperialism, 1830-1907|year=2004|publisher=SEAP Publications|isbn=0-8772-7736-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are approximately 72,000 Batin living in the interior of south-central Sumatra. They speak a dialect of the [[Jambi Malay|Jambi]] variant of [[Malay (language)|Malay]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=jax Ethnologue report for "Malay, Jambi"]&lt;/ref&gt; but the accent is similar to [[Minangkabau language]].&lt;ref&gt;http://kebudayaanindonesia.net/id/culture/1248/suku-batin#.Un-uZVQW2BM&lt;/ref&gt;

The Batin are predominantly [[Muslim]], but have a [[matrilineal]] kinship system, which is similar to Minangkabau than to Jambi Malays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elsbeth Locher-Scholten|contribution=Proyek Penelitian dan Pencatatan Kebudayaan Daerah|title=Adat istiadat daerah Jambi|year=1977|publisher=Pusat Penelitian Sejarah dan Budaya, Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan|oclc=506883187|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Dubbo''', sometime called as '''The Battle of Hyderabad'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khuhro|first=Hamida|title=Mohammed Ayub Khuhro: A Life Of Courage In Politics|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=969-0-01424-2 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was fought on 24 March 1843 between the forces of British [[East India Company]] and the [[Talpur]] [[Emir]]s of [[Sindh]] near [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. A small British force, led by Captain [[Sir James Outram, 1st Baronet|James Outram]], were attacked by the Talpurs and forced to make a fort of the British residence, which they successfully defended until they finally escaped to a waiting river steamer. After the British victory at [[Battle of Miani|Meeanee]] (also spelt Miani), [[Sir Charles James Napier|Charles Napier]] continued his advance to the [[Indus River]] and attacked the Sindh capital of Hyderabad. Hyderabad was defended by 20,000 troops and baloch tribes under the command of [http://www.talpur.org/Home/mankani-talpurs/the-lion-of-sindh His Highness Mir Sher Muhammad Khan Talpur "Sher-i-Sindh"] and [[Hoshu Sheedi|Hosh Mohammad]] sheedi. Charles Napier with a force of only 3,000 men but with artillery support stormed the city.  During the battle Hosh Mohammad sheedi was killed and his forces routed; Talpurs resistance collapsed and Sindh came under British rule.

==Prelude==
The British East India company became involved in the region of Sindh in Pakistan (at that time [[India]]), under the authority of [[Baron Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]]. In 1809, The Amirs of Sindh signed a treaty of "friendship" with the British, who established a local representative in the city of Hyderabad. With this arrival of British influence within the region, the Amirs of the Sindh lessened their internal struggles and turned instead to face this foreign presence.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, ''A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838 to 1849,'' p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, the British representative had the Amirs sign a political residency treaty, allowing a British residency in the city of Hyderabad, which paved the way for further British involvement in the area. This same treaty also stipulated that the British would assist in negotiating the differences held between the rulers of the Sindh and those of the [[Punjab]].&lt;ref name=Wallis113&gt;Wallis, ''A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838 to 1849,'' p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, this would be taken a step further in the signing of a treaty pushed by the British that if needed British troops would be stationed permanently in the Sindh region for ‘the protection of the Amirs’. The Amirs however would have to pay for a British resident in Hyderabad, who would negotiate all relations between the British and the Amirs.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, ''A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838 to 1849,'' p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British maintained various policies among the different Amirs, so as to please each individual and divide them by dealing with them separately.&lt;ref name=Wallis113/&gt; Captain James Outram was initially in charge of these dealings, and he made significant progress with the Amirs, who began confiding in him. As a result, Outram was able to attain power over the Amirs’ foreign policy as well as to station his troops in the province.&lt;ref name=Wallis113/&gt; Tensions began to rise when the British, who were involved in the politics in [[Afghanistan]] at the time, started interfering in the internal affairs of the Amirs as well as asking them for land which the British desired. The British were supporting Shah Shujah Durrani to take the throne in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=Wallis114&gt;Wallis, ''A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838 to 1849,'' p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The Amirs, however, resented this proposal, which added to their discontentment with the British occupations. The Amirs refused to aid Shah Shujah in Afghanistan and, siding more with the Shah of Persia, angered the British.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, ''A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838 to 1849,'' p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

These relations took a turn for the worse when allegations were made of the Amirs communicating with the Shah of Persia, a rival of Shah Shujah and the British. It was after this incident that the British made it clear to the Amirs of the Sindh that any further cooperation with any people other than the British would lead to their destruction and their loss of rule in the Sindh.&lt;ref name=Wallis114/&gt; The distrust between the British and the Amirs of the Sindh continued to worsen, as both sides grew more and more suspicious of each other. Both sides continued on, feigning normality while both were aware of the other’s mistrust.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, ''A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838 to 1849,'' p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of their distrust, the British began to keep a close eye on Noor Mohammed Khan, one of the most prominent Amirs, at his residence in Hyderabad.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, ''A History of the British Conquest of Afghanistan and Western India, 1838 to 1849,'' p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, the British appointed Charles Napier for service in India at the age of 59. The following year Napier arrived in Bombay on 26 August. Upon his arrival he was told of the situation that existed between the British and the Amirs, and that the Amirs were making trouble for the British. On 10 September 1842 Napier arrived in the Sindh.&lt;ref&gt;Duarte, ''A History of British Relations with Sind, 1613–1843,'' p. 403–404.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Napier, British control saw some charity on their occupation of Sindh and the territory of the Amirs. There was a belief that the British were, in fact, improving life for many in the area, as they saw the Amirs as overly wealthy rulers over a poor people.&lt;ref&gt;Duarte,''A History of British Relations with Sind, 1613–1843,'' p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; Napier was also very much of a mind to expand and tighten British control. Previously Outram had been in charge of negotiations between the British and the Amirs and had been very lenient towards the Amirs, which they appreciated greatly. Napier, on the other hand, not only longed for campaign, but was also very authoritarian with regard to the British rule in the area, and wanted to see full control by the British.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, ''The British Conquest and Dominion of India,'' p. 567.&lt;/ref&gt; Napier himself was charged by Ellenborough to look into the matter of the Amirs’ duplicity, to find evidence of their suspicious behaviour, and to compile it into a report which he would submit to Ellenborough.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, ''The British Conquest and Dominion of India,'' p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the fact that Napier was fresh to the Sindh and knew none of the language which would allow him to understand the pieces of alleged evidence against the Amirs, he was left with a difficult task.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, ''The British Conquest and Dominion of India,'' p. 565-566.&lt;/ref&gt;

Napier’s 200-page report was submitted to Ellenborough, who received the it on November 3. The report was fairly inaccurate in its information about the Amirs, and Ellenborough sent his reply the day after as well as draft of a new treaty to be made with the Amirs.&lt;ref&gt;Duarte, ''A History of British Relations with Sind, 1613–1843,'' p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of the reply, as well as the fact that it was accompanied by a drafted treaty, would indicate that Ellenborough had made his decision and the draft even before receiving Napier’s report.&lt;ref&gt;Duarte, ''A History of British Relations with Sind, 1613–1843,'' p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellenborough’s reply urged Napier to find convicting evidence of the actions of the Amirs - of which he had fairly little. His most incriminating piece of evidence was a letter supposedly written by the Amir, but which might easily have been a forgery, of which Napier was aware. As a result, Napier wrote to Ellenborough again, telling him of the small pieces of evidence that he had and asked for Ellenborough’s help in the situation. However, Ellenborough replied saying that he agreed with the verdict made by Napier - though he had not concretely stated one.&lt;ref&gt;Duarte, ''A History of British Relations with Sind, 1613–1843,'' p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict==
In February 1843, Amir Sodbar resided at Hyderabad Fort. While Sodbar was cooperative with the British, Napier was wary of him, and felt Sodbar was too much of a liability for the British, though the Amir was unaware of these feelings.&lt;ref name=Lambrick150&gt;Lambrick, ''Sir Charles Napier and Sind'', p. 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when Napier asked Sodbar to send away Talpurs troops from the Fort, Amir Sodbar complied. Napier then took control of the fort himself, raising the British flag and stationing troops there.&lt;ref name=Lambrick150/&gt; At first Napier was hesitant to hold Sodbar prisoner. However, after some of Sodbar’s men resisted the British, against Sodbar’s will, Napier decided to hold the Amir as a prisoner in Hyderabad Fort.&lt;ref&gt;Lambrick, ''Sir Charles Napier and Sind,'' p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellenborough gave orders for all treasure and articles of wealth to be seized from the Amir’s residence in Hyderabad, except that which the women chose to retain as their own jewelry or possessions. Collection agents were appointed to mediate the confiscation of the wealth. Some of the women made good use of this opportunity to take large amounts of wealth with them, while others, fearful of the British appointees, gave up much of their possessions.&lt;ref&gt;Lambrick, ''Sir Charles Napier and Sind,'' p. 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, Napier heard word of one of the Amirs, Sher Mohammad, mustering troops to resist the British forces. Napier was under the impression that Sher Mohammad would offer little resistance as he had very little funds or weapons, and was therefore surprised to hear that he had almost 30,000 troops ready to be brought against the British.&lt;ref&gt;Lambrick, ''Sir Charles Napier and Sind,'' p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon hearing of Sher Mohammad’s foreboding army, Napier immediately sent for reinforcements to be sent from Ferozepur and [[Sukkur]]. Around the same time, Talpur soldiers began to attack British supply routes along the Indus as well as those from [[Karachi]] to other British holdings.&lt;ref name=Lambrick157&gt;Lambrick, ''Sir Charles Napier and Sind,'' p. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Napier’s intent to hold off battle as long as he could so as to get the most reinforcements that he could manage. He was sent a message from Sher Mohammad, promising the safety of Napier and his men if he would give up the fort and the confiscated wealth. In reply, Napier fired cannons from the fort as a sign that he would not surrender.&lt;ref name=Lambrick157/&gt;

On 20 March, Sir Charles Napier went out to reconnotire Sher Mohammad’s position near [[Tando Ali Jam]], finding the Amir’s army to be strong and holding excellent territory for defense. The next day, Napier received much needed reinforcements who arrived by ship, coming down the Indus from Sukkur.&lt;ref&gt;Lambrick, ''Sir Charles Napier and Sind,'' p. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
[[File:Plan of the Battle of Dubba.jpg|thumb|left|A British map of the battle]]
On 24 March 1843 British troops, led by Sir Charles Napier, set out from Hyderabad to meet Sher Mohammad. After marching for some time, the British forces came upon the Amir’s army.&lt;ref name=Lambrick161&gt;Lambrick, ''Sir Charles Napier and Sind,'' p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; While waiting for the rest of the British army, the [[Scinde Horse]], one of Napier’s cavalry regiments, began to position themselves in a line opposite the Talpurs troops, who began to fire on the regiment. Napier himself had to do much of the positioning of the troops, as he lacked experienced commanders within his regiments. As each regiment made its way to the battle, and into position, the fighting grew fierce between both sides.&lt;ref name=Lambrick161/&gt; The Talpur troops were well entrenched in their position and, due to the terrain, Napier was unable to get an idea of just how far the Talpur line was and how well it was supported. Soon the British had brought up artillery as well, which opened fire on the Talpur troops in their trenches. As the British approached the left side of Talpur forces, they found themselves faced with heavy attack from the trees, where a large number of troops had positioned themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Lambrick, ''Sir Charles Napier and Sind,'' p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

After almost an hour of fire between both sides, Napier began to see an opportunity to break through a weak spot in the Amir’s lines. The Scinde Horse and [[3rd Bombay Light Cavalry]] made a move to attack the left wing of the British troops and crashed into the Talpur before they could do significant damage.&lt;ref name=Moon574/&gt; Meanwhile, on the right wing British soldiers charged the Talpur lines, piling over their trenches where the tightly packed Talpur's found difficulty in using their swords against the British. Seeing the desperation of the Talpur plight Amir Sher Mohammad left the battle at the suggestion of his commander, Hosh Mohammad Kambrani (Also called Hosh Muhammad Shidi), with hopes that he might obtain another chance at victory over the British. Hosh Muhammad, on the other hand, stayed behind with the troops, fighting the British to the death.&lt;ref&gt;Lambrick, ''Sir Charles Napier and Sind,'' p. 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Dubba.jpg|thumb|right|British troops charge the Talpur lines (from a British book)]]
The British troops, seeing the centre of the Talpur line giving way, charged through the middle, dividing the Amir’s line. About this time, Napier was almost killed when a magazine exploded near by, killing some British soldiers near him, but sparing his life.&lt;ref name=Lambrick166&gt;Lambrick, ''Sir Charles Napier and Sind,'' p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Napier’s commanders, after breaking through the Talpurs left wing then left the field, perhaps aiding later in cutting off the Talpurs retreat. The Amir’s men, routed and disorganized, began to flee, and Napier with the [[Bengal Cavalry]] pressed on after them, cutting them off from escaping across the Indus. This strategic move on the part of the British stopped the Talpurs from regrouping with others and posing a threat to the British. With the Talpurs dispersed, Napier returned to his men who celebrated their victor with three cheers.&lt;ref name=Lambrick166/&gt; This battle would be one of the last major efforts by Sher Mohammad to resist against the British, which ended on 14 June when British troops surprised the Amir and captured three of his cannons. Sher Mohammad himself escaped to Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, ''The British Conquest and Dominion of India,'' p. 574–575.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following the British victory, and consequent annexation of the Sindh, troubles quickly arose. Captain James Outram, who had been sent back to England following his posting in the Sindh, began to plead the case of the Amirs in England. Coupled with the new victory, stark criticism arose in England towards both Ellenborough and Napier, who wrote, pleading their own case and arguing over the details of their dealings with the Amirs.&lt;ref name=Moon575&gt;Moon, ''The British Conquest and Dominion of India,'' p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities in England were not pleased with the annexation of the Sindh, and had in mind to restore the territory to the Amirs. However, thinking that the process of returning the Sindh to its original owners would be difficult and that the forced resignation of Ellenborough and Napier would cause further criticism from England, the ownerships of the Sindh would remain with the British.&lt;ref name=Moon575/&gt; The government in England did write to Napier and Ellenbourough, condemning the annexation and their actions. The actual province of Sindh was not as prosperous as Napier had hoped after capture, and for many years the British gained very little from its possession.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, ''The British Conquest and Dominion of India,'' p. 576.&lt;/ref&gt;
===EIC Casualties===
The Hyderabad war memorial details 39 EIC casualties suffered during the battle, naming:
* Lt. J.C.Smith Horse artillery.
* CPT. Carrett 9th Bengal Cavalry.
* One drummer 21st B.N.I
And summarising the casualties thus;
* 1 - 3rd Bombay Cavalry
* 3 - Poona Horse
* 23 - 22nd Cheshire 
* 2 - 1st Grenadier N.I
* 1 - 12th B.N.I

{{Politics of the Philippines}}
The '''Coco Levy Fund Scam''' was a controversy in the 1970s and 80's in the [[Philippines]] involving the former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and his [[crony|cronies]]. It is alleged that Marcos, [[Danding Cojuangco]], [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], and others conspired to [[tax]] [[coconut]] [[farmers]], promising them the development of the coconut industry and a share of the investments, but on the contrary were used for personal profit particularly in the purchase of [[United Coconut Planters Bank]] (UCPB) and majority stake in [[San Miguel Corporation]] (SMC), to name a few.&lt;ref name="MB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/50476 |title=Cojuangco loses claim to UCPB block |work=Manila Bulletin |author=Panesa, Edmer F. |publisher=MB.com.ph |accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue is still ongoing up to this day, with coconut farmers fighting for justice against the forced taxation, and a share of the Coco Levy Funds' investments.  The Coco Levy Fund is estimated to have ballooned anywhere in the range of [[Philippine peso|P]]100-150 billion in assets.&lt;ref name="Varsitarian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.varsitarian.net/news/ucpb_exec_talks_on_coco_levy_scam |title=UCPB exec talks on coco levy scam |work=Varsitarian|author=Requinta, Elka Krystle R. |publisher=The Varsitarian Online |accessdate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGGExec"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20100608-274511/PCGG-exec-doubts-coconut-levy-funds-recovery |title=PCGG exec doubts coconut levy fund’s recovery |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |author=Tubeza, Philip |publisher=Inquirer.net |accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent Supreme Court decision&lt;ref&gt;[http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2012/january2012/177857-58.htm Philippine Coconut Farmers Federation (COCOFED) vs. Republic of the Philippines]&lt;/ref&gt; awarding P85 million in coconut levy funds is the latest turn in the 40-year struggle to bring to poor coconut farmers the benefits of the Marcos-era levies gouged from them.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/90526083/The-CenSEI-Report-Vol-2-No-15-April-16-22-2012#outer_page_11 The Coco Levy Funds: Is the Shell Game Approaching Its End?] The CenSEI Report, 16 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Philippine]] coconut industry is responsible for 25% of the volume of the agricultural sector, and it is reportedly present in 68 of the 79 provinces of the country.  Next to sugar, coconut products is also the leading agricultural export of the Philippines, with 37 products and by-products that were exported to 114 countries. The major exports are crude and refined oil, copra meal, desiccated coconut, activated carbon, and oleo-chemicals.&lt;ref name="RolandoDy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4938753/The-Philippine-Coconut-Industry-Performance-Issues-and-Recommendations |title=The Philippine Coconut Industry: Performance Issues and Recommendations |work=Ateneo De Manila University |author=Dy, Rolando PhD |publisher=Scribd.com|accessdate=2006-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About one-third of the Philippine population depends mainly on coconut production for its livelihood.&lt;ref name="ManuelCastro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philsol.nl/A00b/CocoLevy-background-jul00.htm |title=The Philippine Coconut Industry and the Coconut Levy  |work=Philippine European Solidarity Centre (PESC-KSP) |author=Castro, Manuel |publisher=PESC-KSP|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal beginnings of the levy could be found in the Republic Act 6260, the Coconut Investment Act, of 19 June 1971.  The act calls for the creation of a Coconut Investment Fund and a Coconut Investment Company (CIC).  The objective of the CIC was to: (a) To fully tap the potential of the coconut planters in order to maximize their production and give them greater responsibility in directing and developing the coconut industry; (b) to accelerate the growth of the coconut industry and other related coconut products from the raw material stage to the semi-finished and finally, the finished product stage; (c) to improve, develop and expand the marketing system; and (d) to ensure stable and better incomes for coconut farmers.&lt;ref name="RA6260"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno6260.html |title=Republic Act 6260, the Coconut Investment Act |work=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library  |author= |publisher=Philippine Congress|accessdate=1971-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 1973, President Marcos created the [[Philippine Coconut Authority]] through P.D. 232.  The PCA's mandate was "to promote accelerated growth and development of the coconut and other palm oils industry so that the benefits of such growth shall accrue to the greatest number, and to provide continued leadership and support in the integrated development of the industry."  The said decree also consolidated the responsibilities and activities of the Coconut Coordinating Council (CCC), the Philippine Coconut Administration (PHILCOA), and the Philippine Coconut Research Institute (PHILCORIN), under one office.&lt;ref name="PD232"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1973/pd_232_1973.html |title=Presidential Decree No. 232, Creating a Philippine Coconut Authority |work=The LawPhil Project, Philippine Laws and Jurisprudence Databank  |author= |publisher=Arellano Law Foundation|accessdate=1973-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Coco Levy litigations==
The Coco Levy Case (Sandiganbayan Civil Case No. 33) is actually subdivided into a total of eight cases involving different parties and properties. Arguably the most important case is Case No. 33-F, which involves 51% of the shares of mega-conglomerate San Miguel Corporation. This majority stake at San Miguel has been further subdivided into three separate litigations, each of which reaching the Supreme Court in highly contentious proceedings.
 
The first case involved 4% of San Miguel shares, which, in the case of ''San Miguel Corporation vs. Sandiganbayan'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2000/sept2000/104637_38.htm San Miguel Corporation vs. Sandiganbayan (G.R. No. 104637, September 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; was awarded by the Supreme Court to the government. The second case, ''Republic of the Philippines vs. Sandiganbayan and Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2011/april2011/166859.htm Republic of the Philippines vs. Sandiganbayan and Eduardo Cojuangco Jr. (G.R. No. 166859, April 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; involved a 20% block that the Supreme Court, voting 7–4, awarded to Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco. The most recent High Court pronouncement came early this year, ''Philippine Coconut Producers Federation, Inc. (COCOFED) vs. Republic of the Philippines'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2012/january2012/177857-58.htm Philippine Coconut Producers Federation, Inc. (COCOFED) vs. Republic of the Philippines (G.R. No. 177857, January 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; where the Court, voting 11–0, declared that the remaining 27% of San Miguel is owned by the government.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt; (Note: The 27% had been diluted to 24% due the government’s failure to subscribe to the increased authorized capital stock of San Miguel)

'''Dave Johnson''' is an [[United States|American]] [[announcer]] and [[sportscaster]], best known for his work in [[horse racing]] with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[NBC]] Sports and at various race tracks in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. His signature line — "And ''down'' the stretch they come!" — is instantly recognizable throughout the sport, and often imitated by [[comedian]]s, notably [[David Letterman]].

From 1972 to 1977, Johnson was the [[public address]] announcer for the tracks of the [[New York Racing Association]]. In 1977 he moved to the new [[Meadowlands Racetrack]] in [[New Jersey]], calling both [[Thoroughbred]] and [[harness racing]]. He maintained his Meadowlands schedule into the early 21st century. Though he's no longer the regular voice at the Big M, he continues to do special appearances in his role as senior track announcer.

For ABC, Johnson called the [[Kentucky Derby]] from 1978 to 1980 and 1982 to 2000, and the [[Preakness Stakes]] and [[Belmont Stakes]] from 1982 to 2000.

Even though Johnson's Triple Crown TV spot went to [[Tom Durkin]] when the rights shifted from ABC to NBC, he has continued to call the three spring classics for radio, on [[Premiere Radio Networks]] and [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]]. Johnson has also worked on horse racing telecasts for [[Thoroughbred Racing on ESPN|ESPN]].

In 2007, Johnson missed calling the Kentucky Derby at [[Churchill Downs]] for the first time since 1977, when the rights shifted from Westwood One to [[ESPN Radio]]. He was replaced on the broadcast by Churchill's public-address announcer, [[Luke Kruytbosch]].

Johnson has also done [[advertising|commercials]], both on camera and voice-over, for [[Mobil Oil]] and various New York-area businesses. In 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, Johnson made voice appearances on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]],'' on the day prior to the running of the Kentucky Derby, for a sound bite of his signature phrase "...and ''down'' the stretch they come!"

Johnson portrayed himself as the track announcer at [[Belmont Park]] in the film ''[[Ruffian (film)|Ruffian]],'' about the famous match race in 1975 in which the [[filly]] [[Ruffian (horse)|Ruffian]] broke down as she raced [[Foolish Pleasure]].

About 70% of Siberia's people live in cities. [[Novosibirsk]] is the largest city in Siberia, with a population of about 1.5 million, followed by [[Yekaterinburg]] (1.3 million, Urals), [[Omsk]] (1.1 million), [[Chelyabinsk]] (1.07 million, in the Urals), [[Krasnoyarsk]] (0.91 million), [[Barnaul]] (0.60 million), [[Irkutsk]] (0.59 million), [[Kemerovo]] (0.52 million), [[Tyumen]] (0.51 million), [[Tomsk]] (0.48 million), [[Nizhny Tagil]] (0.39 million, Urals), [[Kurgan, Kurgan Oblast|Kurgan]] (0.36 million), [[Ulan Ude]] (0.36 million), [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]] (0.32 million).

The above count, however, by including the entire Urals Federal District, includes cities not usually considered part of Siberia, i.e. Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, and Nizhny Tagil.

==Ethnicities and languages==
{{main|Indigenous peoples of Siberia}}
The vast majority of the Siberian population (over 95%) is [[Slavs|Slavic]] and other [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] ethnicities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perepis-2010.ru/results_of_the_census/result-december-2011.ppt |title=ВПН-2010 |website=Perepis-2010.ru |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118212344/http://www.perepis-2010.ru/results_of_the_census/result-december-2011.ppt |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/perepis_itogi1612.htm |title=ВПН-2010 |website=Gks.ru |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Germans]]. Most non-Slavic groups are [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]. Smaller linguistic groups are
[[Mongols]] (ca. 600,000 speakers)
[[Uralic languages|Uralic]] ([[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]], [[Ugric languages|Ugric]]; roughly 100,000 speakers), [[Tungusic languages|Manchu-Tungus]] (ca. 40,000 speakers), [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]] (ca. 25,000 speakers), [[Eskimo–Aleut]] (some 2,000 speakers), the [[Yukaghir languages]] (highly endangered), and languages isolates [[Ket language|Ket]] (but see below) and [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]].

Mongolian, Turkic and Manchu-Tungus languages are sometimes taken together under the term [[Altaic languages|Altaic]]. At one time Uralic and Altaic were believed to form the [[Ural–Altaic]] group, though this theory has now been largely discarded. The proposed [[Uralo-Siberian languages|Uralo-Siberian]] family combines the Uralic family with the Yukaghir languages, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, and Eskimo–Aleut. These are more umbrella terms than accepted linguistic relationships. Ket has recently been linked with the [[Na-Dene languages]] into a [[Dené–Yeniseian languages|Dené–Yeniseian]] group; while not universally accepted a broad consensus in favor of the proposal has emerged.

The '''economic history of the world''' is a record of the economic activities (i.e. the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services) of all humans, spanning both recorded history and evidenced prehistory.

==Paleolithic==

Throughout the [[Paleolithic]] Era, which was between 500,000–10,000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Vaswani | editor-first=Padma | edition=3 | title=Transitions | year=2012 | publisher=Vikas Publishing House Pvt Ltd | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the primary socio-economic unit was the [[Band society|band]] (small kin group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Scarre | editor-first=Chris | edition=2nd | title=The Human Past | year=2009 | publisher=Thames&amp;Hudson | isbn=9780195127058 | page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication between bands occurred for the purposes of trading ideas, stories, tools, foods, animal skins, mates, and other commodities. Economic resources were constrained by typical [[ecosystem]] factors: density and replacement rates of edible flora and fauna, competition from other consumers (organisms) and [[Paleoclimatology|climate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Cameron | first1=Rondo | last2=Neal |first2=Larry |authorlink=Rondo Cameron |year=2003 | title=A Concise Economic History of the World | edition=4th Paperback | publisher=Oxford | isbn=9780195127058 | pages=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[Upper Paleolithic]], humans both dispersed and adapted to a greater variety of environments, and also developed their technologies and behaviors to increase productivity in existing environments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Scarre | editor-first=Chris | edition=2nd | title=The Human Past | year=2009 | publisher=Thames&amp;Hudson | isbn=9780195127058 | pages=171–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Aydon | first=Cyril |  title=A Brief History of Mankind | year=2007 | publisher=Robinson | isbn=9781845297480 | pages=10–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking the global population to between 1 and 15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hassan | first=Fekri A.| title=Demographic Archeology | year=1981 | publisher=Academic Press | isbn=9780123313508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that throughout prehistory, the world average GDP per capita was about $158 [[per annum]] (adjusted to 2013 dollars), and did not rise much until the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;http://delong.typepad.com/print/20061012_LRWGDP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mesolithic==

This period began with the end of the last glacial period over 10,000 years ago involving the gradual domestication of plants and animals and the formation of settled communities at various times and places.

==Neolithic==

Within each [[tribe]] the activity of individuals was differentiated to specific activities, and the characteristic of some of these activities were limited by the resources naturally present and available from within each tribe's territory, creating specializations of skill. By the "... division of labour and evolution of new crafts ..." (Cameron p.&amp;nbsp;25) "tribal units became naturally isolated through time from the over-all developments in skill and technique present within their neighbouring environment. To utilize artifacts made by tribes specializing in areas of production not present to other tribes, exchange and trade became necessary."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rondo Cameron]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=aEHX63g1XsYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Economic+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HbeyT_PRHIXH0QWVuenKCw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Economic%20history&amp;f=false Concise Economic History of the World: From Paleolithic Times to the Present] Oxford University Press, 11 Mar 1993 Retrieved 2012-05-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The first object or physical thing specifically used in a way similar enough to the modern definition of money, i.e. in exchange, was (probably) [[cattle]] (according to R.Davies).&lt;ref&gt;Roy and Glyn Davies [http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/RDavies/arian/amser/chrono1.html History of Money] Exeter University and the University of Wales Press,  Retrieved 2012-05-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Trading in [[red ochre]] is attested in [[Swaziland]],{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} shell jewellery in the form of strung beads also dates back to this period, and had the basic attributes needed of [[commodity money]]. To organize production and to distribute goods and services among their populations, before [[market economies]] existed, people relied on tradition, top-down command, or community cooperation.

==Antiquity: Bronze and Iron ages==

===Early developments in formal money and finance===
{{see also|History of money}}

The [[city states]] of [[Sumer]] developed a trade and market [[economy]] based originally on the [[commodity money]] of the [[shekel]] which was a certain weight measure of [[barley]], while the [[Babylonians]] and their city state neighbors later developed the earliest system of prices using a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] of various [[commodities]] that was fixed in a legal code.&lt;ref&gt;http://history-world.org/reforms_of_urukagina.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The early law codes from Sumer could be considered the first (written) financial law, and had many attributes still in use in the current [[price system]] today; such as codified quantities of [[money]] for business deals (interest rates), fines for 'wrongdoing', inheritance rules, laws concerning how private property is to be taxed or divided, etc.&lt;ref name="yale2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hammint.htm|title=The Code of Hammurabi : Introduction|accessdate=September 14, 2007|publisher=Yale University|year=1915|author=Charles F. Horne, Ph.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a summary of the laws, see [[Babylonian law]].

Temples are history's first documented creditors at interest, beginning in [[Sumer]] in the third millennium. By charging interest and ground rent on their own assets and property, temples helped legitimize the idea of interest‑bearing debt and profit seeking in general. Later, while the temples no longer included the handicraft workshops which characterized third‑millennium [[Mesopotamia]], in their embassy functions they legitimized profit‑seeking trade, as well as by being a major beneficiary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appropriate-economics.org/materials/The_Early_Evolution_of_Interest-Bearing_Debt-Hudson.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Economic history of the world graphical timeline}}

The two major changes in commercial activity due to expedition known by historical recounting, are those led by Alexander the Great,&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Curtius Rufus]], [[William Henry Crosby]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=FvwKAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Quintus+Curtius+Rufus%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lKWyT4-NIaHM0QXPqZWfCQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Quintus Curtius Rufus: Life and exploits of Alexander the Great] D.

===External trade with the Roman Empire===
During the time of the trade of the Occident with Rome, Egypt was the wealthiest of all places within the Roman Empire. The merchants of Rome acquired produce from Persia through Egypt,  by way of the port of Berenice, and subsequently the Nile.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Richard Phillips]]  [https://books.google.com/books?id=7bDYnFZPs5AC&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=Alexander+the+Great+travel+to+India+commerce+and+trade&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YKeyT5LvD_GZ0QXo3pCTCQ&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false New voyages and travels: consisting of originals, translations, and abridgments, Volume 1] printed for Sir Richard Phillips and Co.

===The introduction of coinage===
According to [[Herodotus]], and most modern scholars, the [[Lydians]] were the first people to introduce the use of gold and silver coin.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus. ''Histories'', I, 94&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that these first stamped [[coins]] were minted around 650–600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html Goldsborough, Reid. "World's First Coin"&lt;/ref&gt; A stater coin was made in the stater (trite) denomination. To complement the stater, fractions were made: the trite (third), the hekte (sixth), and so forth in lower denominations.

===Developments in economic awareness and thought===
The first economist (at least from within opinion generated by the evidence of extant writings) is considered to be [[Hesiod]], by the fact of his having written on the fundamental subject of the scarcity of resources, in ''[[Works and Days]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Ptak [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:_d3OqOmaXxcJ:mises.org/journals/scholar/Ptak1.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShAVXhEnSJmSKcta3lTgr28SFlpzxy0kaXTc3AF5z9kyOHnWLeKJ-eAsI2cQtT6PIttCHeiDjzMc2lf-i-SoTwZ3fax2fy4l5dy0waaqGNfwObsB-78bHTekUhKp1anCDM-z4qC&amp;sig=AHIEtbRIldJACkQLUYT-gPp-hr9KaO7MnA] Institute for Business Cycle Research Retrieved 2012-05-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomáš Sedláček [https://books.google.com/books?id=DqpbpxNEF4MC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Hesiod+Works+and+Days+(Economics)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IWgXR9gHBY&amp;sig=QcvuN7FE-jMtXVbg9JGKz7xiwQE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ENqzT7T-KMrU0QWrxtjkDA&amp;ved=0CGYQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Hesiod%20Works%20and%20Days%20(Economics)&amp;f=false Economics of Good and Evil: The Quest for Economic Meaning from Gilgamesh to Wall Street ] Oxford University Press, 1 Oct 2011 Retrieved 2012-05-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arthashastra]], an Indian work that includes sections on political economy, was composed between the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE, and is often credited to the Indian thinker [[Chanakya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Trautmann |first1=Tom |title=Arthashastra : the science of wealth |date=2016 |publisher=Penguin |location=UK |isbn=8184756119 |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek and Roman thinkers made various economic observations, especially [[Aristotle]] and [[Xenophon]].  Many other Greek writings show understanding of sophisticated economic concepts. For instance, a form of [[Gresham’s Law]] is presented in [[Aristophanes]]’ Frogs.

[[Bryson of Heraclea]] was a neo-platonic who is cited as having heavily influenced early Muslim economic scholarship.&lt;ref name="Spengler1964"&gt;Spengler (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
{{main|Medieval economic history}}
{{see also|Economy of England in the Middle Ages|Medieval economy of Scotland|Europeans in Medieval China|Byzantine silk}}
In the Middle Ages the world economy slowly expanded with the increase of population and trade. The silk road was used for trading between Europe, Central Asia and China. During the early period of the Middle Ages, Europe was an economic backwater, however, by the later Medieval period rich trading cities in Italy emerged, creating the first modern accounting and finance systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economypoint.org/e/economics-in-the-middle-ages.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[banknotes]] were used in [[Tang dynasty]] China in the ninth century (with expanded use during the [[Song dynasty]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Early Modern Era==
{{see also|price revolution}}
The [[Early modern era]] was a time of [[mercantilism]], [[nationalism]], and [[international trade]]. The waning of [[Feudalism]] saw new national economic frameworks begin to be strengthened. After the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] et al. opened up new opportunities for trade with the New World and Asia, newly-powerful monarchies wanted a more powerful military state to boost their status. Mercantilism was a political movement and an economic theory that advocated the use of the state's military power to ensure that local markets and supply sources were protected.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The first banknote in Europe was issued by [[Stockholms Banco]] in 1661.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==The Industrial Revolution==
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A [[Watt steam engine]], the [[steam engine]] fuelled primarily by [[coal]] that propelled the Industrial Revolution in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Watt steam engine]] image: located in the lobby of into the Superior Technical School of Industrial Engineers of the UPM ([[Madrid]])&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Economic history as it relates to [[economic growth]] in the modern sense first occurred during the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Europe, due to high amounts of [[energy conversion]] taking place.

==The twentieth century==
[[File:World GDP per capita 20th century.GIF|250px|thumb|right|World GDP per capita in dollars during the twentieth century. Data before 1950 is not annual.]] &lt;!-- the image has to be this size or it looks weird... --&gt;
Economic growth spread to all regions of the world during the twentieth century, when world GDP per capita quintupled. The highest growth occurred in the 1960s during post-war reconstruction.
Some increase in the volume of international trade is due to the reclassification of within-country trade to international trade – because of increasing number of countries and resulting changes in national boundaries. The effect is small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roser | first1 = Max | author1-link = Max Roser | last2 = Crespo-Cuaresma | first2 = Jesus | author2-link = Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma | title = Borders Redrawn: Measuring the Statistical Creation of International Trade | journal = World Economy

In particular, [[shipping containers]] revolutionized trade in the second half of the century, by making it cheaper to transport goods, especially internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Levinson [https://books.google.com/books?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Global+economics+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jpyyT4v9F7C00QWN1uW-CQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Global%20economics%20history&amp;f=false ''The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and The World Economy Bigger''] Princeton University Press, 7 January 2008 Retrieved 2012-05-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twenty-first century and the future==

===Global economic crisis===
{{See also|Financial crisis of 2007–2008|Great Recession}}
{{update section|date=April 2014}}
The world economy was predicted to shrink by between 0.5% and 1.0% in 2009, the first global contraction in 60 years. In its forecast the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that developed countries will suffer "deep recession".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7952377.stm | work=BBC News | title=World economy 'to shrink in 2009' | date=19 March 2009 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of civil unrest and protests in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], Professor Marcia Chatelain of [[Georgetown University]] created the '''#FergusonSyllabus''' [[Twitter]] campaign. Ferguson syllabus provides a space for educators to discuss integrating the events happening in Ferguson into classrooms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://college.georgetown.edu/collegenews/the-ferguson-syllabus.html|title=The #Ferguson Syllabus|last=|first=|date=2014-08-27|website=college.georgetown.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Shooting of Michael Brown}}
On August 9, 2014 an unarmed and noncompliant black teenager, [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]], was fatally shot by white police officer Darren Wilson in [[Ferguson, Missouri]].  The disputed details of Brown’s death sparked protests and [[Ferguson unrest|civil unrest in Ferguson]], across the United States, and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/25/us/evidence-released-in-michael-brown-case.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/25/us/evidence-released-in-michael-brown-case.html|title=Documents Released in the Ferguson Case|last=|first=|date=2014-11-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dispute arose from dueling narratives of why and how the altercation occurred. Officer Wilson and eyewitnesses argued different accounts of what happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/19/us/ferguson-michael-brown-dueling-narratives/|title=Dueling narratives in Michael Brown shooting|last=Staff|first=CNN|date=2014-08-19|work=CNN|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This confusion, along with [[Militarization of police|aggressive policing]] following Brown’s death, led to heated debate and examination of the relationship between policing practices and communities of color. The protests and civil unrest continued on November 24, 2014 after a St. Louis grand jury found Darren Wilson not guilty of criminal charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/us/ferguson-darren-wilson-shooting-michael-brown-grand-jury.html|title=Protests Flare After Ferguson Police Officer Is Not Indicted|last=Davey|first=Monica|date=2014-11-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Bosman|first2=Julie|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the verdict was announced protests flared in Ferguson and in nearly every major U.S. city.

On March 4, 2015 The United States Department of Justice announced the findings of the its two civil rights investigations into the Ferguson Police Department. The Justice Department found that the Ferguson Police Department “engaged in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the First, Fourth, and 14th Amendments of the Constitution.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf|title=Investigation of the Ferguson Police Department|last=|first=|date=2015-03-04|website=US Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Ferguson—a city with a population of 21,000–16,000 people have outstanding arrest warrants, meaning that they are currently actively wanted by the police.

==Purpose==
Ferguson syllabus is a [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] syllabus about race, African American history, civil rights, and policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/08/how-to-teach-kids-about-whats-happening-in-ferguson/379049/|title=How to Teach Kids About What's Happening in Ferguson|last=Chatelain|first=Marcia|date=2014-08-25|work=The Atlantic|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferguson syllabus was created as a way to integrate conversations of what happened in Ferguson into classrooms. Dr. Marcia Chatelain, graduate from University of Missouri-Columbia and assistant professor of history at Georgetown University, created the [[hashtag]] #fergusonsyllabus so that educators could have a platform to discuss the national crisis in Ferguson, Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/mc899/|title=Faculty - Marcia Chatelain|last=|first=|date=|website=Georgetown University|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chatelain describes it as, “What emerged was a small call for community across the sometimes impersonal and expansive digital world.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/teaching-ferguson-syllabus|title=Teaching the #FergusonSyllabus {{!}} Dissent Magazine|last=Chatelain|first=Marcia|date=2014-11-28|work=Dissent Magazine|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chatelain contacted her colleagues in and across her discipline to use Twitter as a mechanism to recommend texts, collaborate on conversation starters, and inspire dialogue about some aspect of the Ferguson events. Chatelain argues, “The academy has never owned movements, and youth outside of colleges longed for intelligent questions, honest reflection, and inspiration moving forward."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Collegiate professors, high school teachers, early education specialists, guidance counselors and middle-school instructors wanted ideas on how to hold purposeful dialogues around this issue. #FergusonSyllabus has now become a virtual movement used to frame how struggle has shaped American history, infused works of art and literature, and given voice to those most hurt by the failures of leadership, capitalism, and democracy.

==Applications==

===Freedom Ferguson Library===
Freedom Ferguson Library is a campaign asking people who benefited from learning from the Ferguson syllabus to consider donating an item to an under-resourced school, prison literacy program, or community center. Professor Marcia Chatelain has asked that people write (or make a nameplate) with a message including the words, Ferguson Freedom Library. The expression Freedom Library comes from the Freedom Summer Project of 1964. Civil rights activists created [[Freedom Schools]] to educate children and adults.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===Ferguson Theater Syllabus===
Inspired by the #FergusonSyllabus, actors and playwrights crowdsourced a list from the Ferguson Moment Facebook group, asking specifically for plays that provide opportunities for conversation around this particular historical moment: the shooting of Michael Brown and the response to that shooting by citizens, law enforcement and the justice system, in Ferguson and in other places like it around the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2014/12/17/the-ferguson-theatre-syllabus/|title=The Ferguson Theatre Syllabus|last=Alick|first=Claudia|date=2014-12-17|work=American Theatre|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Sandberg-Zakian|first2=Megan|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire''' was a [[politico]]-[[economic]] system of relationships between [[liege lord]]s and enfeoffed [[vassal]]s (or feudatories) that formed the basis of the [[social structure]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the [[High Middle Ages]]. In German the system is variously referred to ''Lehnswesen'', ''Feudalwesen'' or ''Benefizialwesen''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Feudalism in Europe emerged in the Early Middle Ages, based on [[Patronage in ancient Rome|Roman clientship]] and the [[Germanic peoples#Culture|Germanic social hierarchy]] of lords and retainers.  It obliged the [[feudatory]] to render personal services to the lord. These included e.&amp;nbsp;g. holding his stirrup, joining him on festive occasions and service as a [[cupbearer]] at the banquet table. Both pledged mutual [[loyalty]]: the lord to "shelter and protect", the vassal to "help and advise". Furthermore, feudal lord and vassal were bound to mutually respect one another, i.e. the lord could not, by law, beat his vassal, humiliate or lay hands on his wife or daughter.&lt;!-- German Wikipedia has "daughter" not "children"; presumably this refers to protection from sexist behaviour or sexual predation. --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The highest liege lord was the sovereign, the [[king]] or [[duke]], who granted [[fief]]s to his [[prince]]s. In turn, they could award fiefs to other [[nobility|nobles]], who wanted to be [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] by them and who were often subordinate to the liege lord in the aristocratic hierarchy.

[[File:Lehensurkunde Götz von Berlichingen Burg Hornberg.jpg|thumb|[[Götz von Berlichingen]] was enfeoffed with [[Hornberg Castle (Neckarzimmern)|Hornberg Castle]] in this deed]]
A [[fief]] (also fee, feu, feud, tenure or fiefdom, '''''{{lang-de|Lehen}}''''', {{lang-lat|feudum}}, ''feodum'' or ''beneficium'') was understood to be a thing (land, property), which its owner, the liege lord (''Lehnsherr''), had transferred to the hereditary [[ownership]] of the beneficiary on the basis of mutual loyalty, with the proviso that it would return to the lord under certain circumstances.

Enfeoffment gave the vassal extensive, hereditary [[usufruct]] of the fief, founded and maintained on a relationship of mutual loyalty between the lord and the beneficiary. The Latin word ''beneficum'' implied, not only the actual estate or property, the fief - in Latin usually called the ''feodum'' - but also the associated legal relationship.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The owner was the so-called liege lord or feudal lord (German: '''''Lehnsherr''''' ''Lehnsgeber''; Latin: ''[[Dominium|dominus]] feudi'', ''senior''), who was usually the [[territorial lord]] or reigning monarch. The beneficiary was his vassal, liegeman or feudatory (German: '''''Vasall''''', ''[[Lehnsmann]]'', ''[[Knecht]]'', ''Lehenempfänger'' or ''Lehensträger''; Latin: ''vassus'' or ''vasallus''). Both parties swore an [[oath of fealty]] ('''''[[Lehnseid]]''''') to one another. The rights conferred on the vassal were so similar to actual possession that it was described as beneficial ownership (''[[dominium utile]]''), whereas the rights of the lord were referred to as direct ownership (''[[dominium directum]]'').

The fief (German: ''Lehen'' or '''''Lehnsgut''''') usually comprised an estate or a complex of estates, but also specified rights of use and rights of taxation or duties.

Linguistically the term ''Lehen'' is connected with the word ''leihen'', to lend or loan, and meant something like "loaned property" (c.f. the modern German ''Darlehen'', a loan), whilst the word ''feudum'', which some etymologists suggest comes from the Latin ''fides'' (loyalty), is more likely to be derived from the [[Old High German]] ''feo'', which meant ''Vieh'' i.e. "cattle", but later generally meant "goods" or "property".

The opposite of a fief was the freehold, [[allod]] or ''allodium'', which roughly corresponds to the present freehold estate.

An institution during the transition from feudal states to what is now the free ownership of property, was the ''allodifizierte Lehen'' ("allodified fief"), a fief in which the feudal lord gave up direct ownership - usually in  return for the payment of compensation or an allodified rent (''Allodifikationsrenten'') - but the vassal's ownership of the fief with an agreed agnatic succession - resembling a family [[entailed estate]] (''Familienfideikommiß'') - remained in place.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Types ===
There were numerous different types of feudal arrangement depending on regional tradition and the nature of feudal lordship (secular or ecclesiastical/monastic). The best-known of these were:

* '''''[[Afterlehen]]:''''' A [[mesne]] fief whereby the vassal awarded (parts of) his fief to a third party
* '''''Altarlehen:''''' A medieval proto-foundation (''proto-Stiftung'').  Its purpose was to allocate annual revenue from the property to a specific primate for his abbey or church
* '''''Beutellehen:''''' originally a ''Ritterlehen'' that was later rented to farmers
* '''''[[Burglehn]]:''''' a fief in payment for services as a [[castellan]] (''[[Burgmann]]'')
* '''''Erblehen:''''' a fief where the heirs of the vassal automatically inherited his rights and duties. The fief only first became hereditary through the conferral of a letter of hereditary right (''Erbrechtsbrief'') from the liege lord
* '''''Fahnlehen:''''' ("banner fief"&lt;ref name="Stieber"&gt;Stieber, Joachim. W. (1978). ''Pope Eugenius IV, the Council of Basel and the Secular and Ecclesiastical Authorities in the Empire'', E.J. Brill, Leiden, p. 124. {{ISBN|90-04-05240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;) a fief to a secular prince, in which banners symbolised the fief and the duties to the [[Heerbann]].
* '''''Falllehen:''''' a fief that expired on the death of the vassal. See ''Schupflehen''
* '''''Freistift:''''' a fief that could be cancelled at 12 months notice
* '''''Handlehen:''''' a fief awarded for a specified period or the life of the vassal. Originally: a fief sealed by a handshake instead of a formal oath of fealty.
* '''''Kunkellehen:'''''  a fief to a vassal who was a woman (also called a ''Weiberlehen'' or ''feudum femininum'')
* '''''Mannlehen/Mannslehen:''''' a fief to a vassal who had to be a man
* '''''ligisches Lehnswesen:''''' a fief in which the vassal was excluded from holding fiefs from other lords through a stronger contract between lord and vassal
* '''''Schildlehen:''''' similar to ''Fahnenlehen'', but where the vassal held the rank of count or lower
* '''''Schupflehen:''''' a fief that expired on the death of the vassal. His heirs were figuratively seen as "pushed" (Old German/Alemannic: ''geschupft'') out of the contract
* '''''Stiftslehen:''''' the fief was granted by an abbey, also called a ''Klosterlehen'' 
* '''''Weiberlehen:''''' see ''Kunkellehen''
* '''''Zepterlehen:''''' a fief to an ecclesiastical prince

== Feudal system ==
The king gave estates or appointments (''Ämter'') to upper or crown vassals (''Kronvasallen''), who, in turn, passed them on to lower vassals (''Untervasallen''). The lower vassals would then hire the land to be cultivated by unfree farmers. There were no feudal relationships between farmers and the lower vassals.

During the Middle Ages another structure developed in Germany, the so-called ''[[Heerschild]]ordnung'', a medieval feudal hierarchy:

* King (''König'')
* Ecclesiastical princes (''Geistliche Fürsten'')
* Secular, or lay, princes (''Weltliche Fürsten'')
* Counts and barons (''Grafen und Freiherren'')
* [[Ministeriales]] (''Ministerialen'' or ''Dienstmannen'')
* Vassals of the ministeriales (''Männer der Ministerialen'')
* Free knights (''Ritterbürtige Mannen'') (who could only receive a fief, not grant one)

Initially, only those of knightly birth were entitled to be enfeoffed, i.e. free knights who could bear arms and were in full possession of their title. Later, unfree ministeriales also rose to the knighthood. Vassalage consisted mainly of military campaigns (military service) and court duty (the presence of vassals at the court in order to offer advice). From court service, the state and imperial diets emerged. The fief was only given to the vassal to utilize; later, the vassal also became a sub-owner, but the feudal lord always retained the rights to this office. Eventually, the heritability of fiefs evolved later, but the landowner nevertheless remain the liege lord.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Roots of feudalism ==

=== Roman patronage ===
{{main|Patronage in ancient Rome}}

In [[Late Antiquity]], out of the Roman system of patronage (or clientage) and the clan (''[[Sippe]]'') relationships of the [[Migration Period]] (''Völkerwanderungszeit'') (Germanic kingdoms on Roman soil), relations between rulers and their subjects developed into a prevailing consensus that was commonplace and accepted.

In Roman culture, it was common for a patron (a wealthy Roman citizen) to automatically retain his freed [[slave]]s in a dependent relationship, known as patronage. In some cases, populations of conquered areas would become clients of the general who conquered the area. This required the client to accompany his patron to war and protect him if the latter so wished, to accompany him to court as a vocal supporter and, if the patron held public office, to act as his assistant and to accompany him on representational events in public.

In return, the patron had to ensure the legal and practical support of his client in all aspects of life. A Roman citizen, a non-Roman and even entire tribes in the Roman Empire could have a patron-client relationship.

In Late Antiquity, this form of relationship was increasingly adopted in rural areas, because the Roman nomenklatura increasingly saw their vast estates (''[[Latifundia]]'') as their refuge and also as economically important pillars, over which they sometimes even had their own jurisdiction and fortified prisons.
 
Clients at that time were usually bound to their patrons through the allocation of land.

=== Germanic clan system ===
During the latter years of the period of [[Sippe|clan society]] with Germanic kingdoms on Roman soil, it was common for all the land to belong to the [[king]]. Only he could distribute land to his subjects. These subjects were usually family members, warriors who had performed outstanding feats, and noblemen. This land did not become the property of the subject, but was handed over to him only ''in persona''. On the death of king or vassal, the land was [[de facto]] returned to the new king. Over time, a practice developed that the person [[enfeoffed]] with the land, together with his family, became the beneficiaries of the [[fief]] and remained permanently bound to it. Upon the death of one party, a new act of homage (''Lehnseid''), a formal legal ceremony, had to take place. These transitions were fluid and there were exceptions to the practice of [[enfeoffment]].

The vassal often enfeoffed the estate, usually divided into smaller parcels of land, to other lesser vassals, who in turn had to swear fealty to him. In return for the lease of land, the king could demand loyalty and allegiance from the vassal and his sub-vassals. This means that, in the event of war, they had to provide soldiers and assistance, or if money ran short or a ransom was needed, they were expected to support the king.

The Roman patron-client relationship and the early clan-based feudal relationship in the Germanic kingdoms merged during the early Middle Ages into the feudal law, or ''Lehnsrecht'', a legal and social set of relationships, which effectively formed a pyramid with the king at the top.

The enforcement of ''Lehnsrecht'' is associated with the reduced circulation of money in the [[Late Antiquity]] and [[Early Medieval]] periods. [[Money]] could not bind a [[vassal]] to a king, only land. Unlike money, this was plentiful.

Even kings (see [[Richard the Lionheart]] - compulsory allegiance) and at least in the early Middle Ages, the [[clergy]] (see [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]]-[[Salian dynasty|Salian]] [[imperial church]] system) could be vassals of a king or another king.

=== Emergence of feudal relationships ===
[[File:Lehnseid.png|thumb|Acceptain of the oath of fealty (''Lehnseid'') in 1512]]
Under the feudal system, various legal institutions came together during the [[Carolingian period]] that had previously existed independently. These institutions were:
* The ''antrustiones'' - these were the inner circle of the king's retinue; they were distinguished by the fact that a multiple of the usual [[weregild]] had to be paid to them.
* The ''vassi'' - free lords who could no longer look after for themselves were able to [[commend]] themselves into the hands of a more powerful lord, receiving sustenance and shelter in return for an obligation of loyalty and service. They did not lose their status as free lords through the [[Commendation ceremony|commendation]] ceremony, but the royal court continued to be responsible for them. The commendation was enacted by the so-called ''handgang'' ceremony, i.e. the future ''vassus'' put his hands, folded, into the hands of his lord, who then enclosed them. This gesture made the relationship of the two very clear.
* The ''beneficium'' (original meaning of "benefit") - in the early Middle Ages land was leased, but there were also cases where estates were granted without requiring recompense, for example under duress or to do someone a favour. The lord then remained the true owner of the land, but was no longer its beneficiary.

It was from the combination of these institutions, especially as more and more lords achieved high social position, that the feudal system emerged.
The ''handgang'', which together with the oath of loyalty (''Treueid''), became referred to as ''homagium'' (Latin), ''homage'' (French), or ''mannschaft'' (German), became the decisive legal device until well into the 12th century. Not until the spread of the system of legal deeds was the ''handgang'' dropped from the oath of allegiance, which was better recorded in writing.

[[Commendation ceremony|Commendation]]s were still carried out at all levels. In lower classes they were based on the [[manorial]] system (''Grundherrschaft''), at the high levels on feudalism (''Lehnswesen'').

The award of fiefs often replaced the remuneration for work. This was necessary because the [[monetary system]] necessary to make regular payments was still far too underdeveloped during the early Middle Ages.

=== Subsequent development ===
As the services of the vassal specifically included military service, under the Frankish monarchy the feudal system was for centuries the basis of the army as well as the social organization of the Holy Roman Empire. &lt;!-- (see [[Personenverbandsstaat]]) --&gt;

It was not only the king who acquired vassals in this way. He was soon imitated by secular and ecclesiastical magnates. Gradually, the principle of the heritability of fiefs was established along with the admissibility of passing them on as ''Afterlehen'' to sub-vassals. The latter were also declared as heritable in 1037 by [[Conrad II (HRR)|Conrad II]] in the ''[[constitutio de feudis]]''. So it came to pass that as early as the 12th century, all duchies and counties were awarded as fiefs.

Within each of these ecclesiastical and secular territories, however, there was a variety of types of feudalism. Not until the 13th century, did the importance of the feudal system decline, because instead of vassals (''Vassallen''), liegemen (''Dienstmannen'') - well-educated men (c.f. the development of the [[university]] system) - were appointed. The kings encouraged this development, for political reasons, and so strengthened [[territorial lordship]] (''Landesherrschaft''), which replaced the feudal system empire-wide. This strengthening of territorial rulers had an impact that could not be reversed, so that the power of the various principalities did not reduce, unlike the situation in France and England.

In England, feudal ties were abolished as early as the Revolution of 1649, and then by an express decree by Charles II in 1660. In France they were abolished by the decisions of the National Assembly on 4 and 5 August 1789. In Germany, the dissolution of feudal associations (''Lehnsverband'') was a long process. Legally, it was abolished ''inter alia'' by the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] acts, in the [[Final Recess of the Reichsdeputation]] and the [[Frankfurt Constitution]] of 1849. One of the last fiefs was awarded in 1835, when the ailing Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Schlitz, known as Görtz, was enfeoffed with the spring at [[Bad Salzschlirf|Salzschlirf]] and began to excavate it again. Those fiefs still in existence in the 20th century were abolished in 1947 by an [[Allied Control Council]] edict.

== Important principles of feudal law in the Holy Roman Empire ==
In general, the vassal (''Lehnsmann'') was granted land or [[Freihaus|free houses]] (''Freihäuser'') in return for his services. He could also provide services at the lord's residence and be accommodated there.  Most of these so-called ''servi non cassati'' were given a fief as soon as one became available.

Official positions (''Ämter'') and sovereign rights over a particular territory (feudal [[regalia]]) could be awarded as a fief. It was in this way that the [[House of Thurn and Taxis]] received its '''''Postlehen''''' or postal service rights. In addition, there were numerous enfeoffments of church rights, church fiefs (''[[Stift]]e'' or ''feudal ecclesiastica'') and enfeoffments of [[foundation (non-profit)|foundation]]s associated with an [[altar]] (''feudum altaragli''). Also, cash payments from the royal treasury or profits from certain duties could be awarded as a fief.

=== Feoffment ===
Feoffment (''constitutio feudi, infeudatio'') involved the vassal being formally seized of his fief through a [[commendation ceremony]]. In Frankish times, commendation centered around the so-called handclasping ceremony (''Handgang''):  the vassal clasped his hands together and placed them in the hands of his lord, who then clasped his hands around those of his vassal. He thereby symbolically received the protection of his new superior. From the end of the 9th century, this act was expanded to include an [[oath of allegiance]], which was usually sworn on a religious [[relic]]. The oath served to affirm the binding of the liegeman to his liege, but emphasized that the vassal had not lost his status as a free knight, because only the free could be bound by oath.

In the 11th century, the commendation ceremony required the liegeman to pay homage (''homagium'' or ''Mannschaft''), which involved the handclasping ceremony as well as a declaration of intent. The liege lord could also make a declaration, but he would often forego this. This was followed by the loyalty oath and sometimes a kiss. Since, in the Middle Ages, a binding legal act could be constituted by a symbolic action, an object was symbolically handed over in a process known as [[livery of seizin]] and could be a staff or a banner (called a ''Fahnenlehn''). The emperor could also symbolically hand over his sceptre (in the so-called ''Zepterlehen''). As literacy rose, a charter of feoffment was also made out as part of the act that, over time, listed the feoffed estate and benefits that the vassal was to receive in ever increasing detail.

In the late Middle Ages, an entry fee was demanded for feoffment, which was often based on the fief's annual income.

The fief (benefice) that the vassal received could be owned by the lord or have been granted in fee by another. Sometimes the vassal even sold or gifted over his possessions to the lord (''Lehnsauftragung'') and then received it back as a fief ([[Oblation (legal)|''oblatio feudi'']]). This was usually done in the hope that the liege lord could defend his estate better in the event of a dispute in the field or at court. The lord purchased or accepted the gift because he might have the intention or hope, for example, of merging unrelated fiefdoms into a whole and thus extending his sphere of influence, for example, in terms of jurisdiction, or the appointment of clergy.

=== Legal relationship between lords and vassals ===
From the 11th century, the obligations of vassals were usually described as ''auxilium et consilium'' (help and advice). ''Auxilium'' usually implied assistance in terms of military service that the vassal had to render. This could be unlimited, i.e. the vassal had to assist his lord in every conflict, or it could be limited in time, space and in the number of troops to be raised. With the advent of the mercenaries, the reliance on vassals became less important and their service increasingly took the form of administration and court duties. ''Consilium'' meant primarily the obligation to appear at imperial assemblies or ''[[Hoftag]]e''. Vassals whose feudal lord was not the king took part in the councils of their liege lords. They also had to administer justice over their subjects in the name of their master.

The vassal could even be required to pay money; though perhaps not to the extent of England, where military service became a requirement for war funds and the English king used the money to pay for his mercenaries. Monetary payments were also required in other cases, such as to pay a ransom for a captive lord, for the [[accolade]] of his eldest son, for the [[dowry]] of his eldest daughter, or for a journey to the [[Holy Land]].

The feudal lord could also demand recompense (''Lehnserneuerung'' or ''renovatio investiturae'') from his vassals if they lost their fief or upon changes of lord - changes of ruler at any level, local lord, prince or king (known as ''Herrenfall, Hauptfall, Thronfall'') - as well as changes of vassal (known as ''Lehnsfall, Vasallenfall'' or ''Mannfall, Nebenfall''). The latter had to submit a written application (''Lehnsmutung'') within a [[Year and a day rule|year and a day]] (actually 1 year, 6 weeks, 3 days) and ask for the renewal of his investiture, but this term could be extended by a decree from the lord (''Lehnsindult'').

Depending on [[local law]], the vassal might be liable, apart from the fee, for the renewal of the enfeoffment (called the ''Schreibschilling'' or ''Lehnstaxe''), to pay a special tax (the ''Laudemium, Lehnsgeld, Lehnsware'' or ''Handlohn''). Finally, in the event of a [[felony]] by the vassal, the lord could confiscate the fief under the so-called ''Privationsklage'' action or step in to prevent the deterioration of the estate, if necessary, by legal means. He could also assert his claim to ownership at any time against any unauthorized third parties.

The duties of the lords were less precisely defined, however, they were largely discharged on the handover of the fief. The vassal always had a claim to loyalty from his lord (''Lehnsprotektion'') and a breach of that by the lord meant the loss of his sovereignty over his vassal. The vassal had the "right of use" of the fief (the object of enfeoffment or  ''Lehnsobjekt''). The lord also had to represent his vassals in court.

=== Dissolution of a feudal relationship ===
Originally, a lord-vassal tie (''Lehnsbindung'') was a lifelong, faithful relationship that could end only on death. It was also inconceivable that someone could be the vassal of more than one lord. In fact, multiple vassalage soon emerged and loosened the duty of loyalty for the liegeman (''Lehnsmann'') considerably. Also, the opportunity to inherit a fief diminished the ability of the lord to intervene and loosened the personal loyalty of liegemen. Over time, the importance of fiefdoms increased more and more, whilst the duty of loyalty faded increasingly into the background. In the end, a fief was simply an estate for which the heir had to perform a certain ceremony.

== Summary ==
In summary, the feudal system was based on two main components - the personal and the material elements.

Personal element:
The lord and vassal committed themselves to mutual loyalty. The visible expression of this commitment was the act of the vassal placing his hands in those of his lord (''handgang'' - comparable with today's handshake, except that the ''handgang'' symbolized a hierarchical relation).

Material element:
Based on the pledge of loyalty between them, the lord made land available to the vassal. The vassal was obliged, in return, to render various services and taxes.

== Family, house and place names ==
An echo of the old feudal system in Europe is found in family names such as [[Lehner]], Lechner, Lehmann, Lehle, Horrigan and Lenherr as well as in numerous house and even place names, that even today have the term ''Lehen'' in the names (see a list at [[Lehen (disambiguation)]]).

A '''goodwill tour''' is a tour by someone or something famous to a series of places, with the purpose of expressing benevolent interest or concern for a group of people or a region, improving or maintaining a relationship between parties, and exhibiting the item or person to places visited.

Goodwill tours are meant to be friendly; however, in some cases, they may be intimidating to the people or the government at the place visited. At the same time, a visit by a goodwill tour might be used as a way of “reminding” the place and government visited of a friendship previously established or assumed.

== Examples of the term ==
* A goodwill tour of the [[Mediterranean]] by ships of the [[U.S. Navy]].
* A goodwill tour by the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf zeppelin]].
* A goodwill tour of the Commonwealths by the monarch.
* A goodwill tour of [[South America]] by the [[Pope]].
* A goodwill tour of the United States by [[James Monroe]]

== Notable goodwill tours ==
* The [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover#Latin America tour|Latin America goodwill tour]] by President-elect Herbert Hoover in November–December 1928.
* The goodwill tour by the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)]] to Havana harbor.
* The goodwill tour to [[Japan]] by [[Matthew C. Perry|Admiral Perry]] in 1852.
* The goodwill tour to [[Japan]] by the [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)]] in 1949.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3176">'''Goyim riders''' refers to members of the '''Goyim Motorcycle Association''' (Hungarian:  Gój Motoros Egyesület), an [[anti-Roma|anti-Gypsy]] and [[antisemitic]]  Hungarian ultra-nationalist political movement.

==Etymology==
The name is rooted in the [[Biblical Hebrew]] word [[goy]] meaning "a [[people]] or "a [[nation]]."  A term that shifted in [[Yiddish]] and [[modern Hebrew]] to refer to a non-Jew, sometimes pejoratively. A "a series of philological essays in the premier weekly of the Hungarian liberal literati, [[Élet és Irodalom]] (Life and Literature)" by "distinguished linguists," discussed the reversal in usage by the Goyim riders which turned the out-group definition into an in-group definition.&lt;ref name="Molnar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cifra, M. 2008. ‘A Gój és gádzsó motorosokról’. Élet és Irodalom 4., 25 January.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gecső, T. 2008. ‘A Gój Motorosok esete a kék halakkal’. Élet és Irodalom 1., 4 January.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kálmán, L. 2007. ‘A Gój Motorosok elnevezésről’. Élet és Irodalom 47., 23 November.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and membership==
The group was informally established by 2000, and organized as a non-profit civic association in 2006.&lt;ref name="Molnar"&gt;Molnár, V. (2016) Civil society, radicalism and the rediscovery of mythic nationalism. Nations and Nationalism, 22: 165–185. doi: 10.1111/nana.12126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is prosperous, as the ability to afford an expensive, often imported, motorcycle is beyond the means of most working-class Hungarians, and includes prominent figures in business and sports.&lt;ref name="Molnar"/&gt;

==Ideology==
The group's emblem shows an armed [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] warrior shooting arrows as he rides a powerful motorcycle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gojmotorosok.hu/|title=Gój Motorosok - Kezdőlap|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the figure of the warrior superimposed on a map of the pre-World War I [[Kingdom of Hungary]], including the lands lost when Hungary lost that war.&lt;ref name="Molnar"/&gt;

==Activities==
The riders organize group rides through towns where [[Romani people|Gypsys]] are accused of committing crimes, rides that are non-violent but perceived as veiled threats.&lt;ref name="Molnar"/&gt;

In 2013 a controversy arose concerning plans by to hold a ride on [[Holocaust Memorial Day]] under the banner of "Step on the gas!". This less than subtle attempt at provocation was soon condemned by the [[Fidesz]] party as well as the Goyim riders, the latter were originally believed to have been the driving force behind the initiative which was described as "tasteless".&lt;ref name="MororbileMarchBanned"&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Semitic motorbike action to be banned|url=http://www.budapost.eu/2013/04/anti-semitic-motorbike-action-to-be-banned/|accessdate=8 June 2016|publisher=Budapost|date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tol.org/client/article/23716-hungary-orban-eu.html Hungary’s Busiest Firefighter], ''TOL'', 16 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Harmonious Society''' ({{zh |s = 和谐社会 |p = héxié shèhuì }}) has been a socioeconomic vision in [[China]].

The concept of social harmony dates back to ancient China, to the time of [[Confucius]]. As a result, the philosophy has also been characterized as a form of [[New Confucianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Guo And Guo |title=China in Search of a Harmonious Society |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bcRqAAAAQBAJ |date=15 August 2008|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-3042-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruiping Fan|title=Reconstructionist Confucianism: Rethinking Morality after the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXb7xA1VoMMC|date=11 March 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-481-3156-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/opinion/14iht-edbell.2807200.html?_r=0|title=China's leaders rediscover Confucianism - Editorials &amp; Commentary - International Herald Tribune|author=|date=|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2014/11/171_94973.html|title=Confucian concept of harmonious society|author=|date=September 18, 2011|website=koreatimes.co.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/5282393/Modern_Confucianism_and_the_Concept_of_Harmony|title=Modern Confucianism and the Concept of Harmony|first=Jana|last=Rosker|date=|website=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold, Perris 1983"&gt;Arnold, Perris.

The philosophy is recognized as a response to the increasing social injustice and inequality emerging in mainland Chinese society as a result of unchecked economic growth, which has led to social conflict. The governing philosophy was therefore shifted around economic growth to overall societal balance and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/11/AR2006101101610.html |title=China's Party Leadership Declares New Priority: 'Harmonious Society' |work=The Washington Post |date= October 12, 2006|accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a [[moderately prosperous society]], it was set to be one of the national goals for the ruling vanguard [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]].

The promotion of the "Harmonious Society" demonstrated that Hu Jintao's ruling philosophy had departed from that of his predecessors.&lt;ref name=20061011atimes&gt;Zhong, Wu. [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/HJ11Ad01.html “China yearns for Hu's 'harmonious society'.”] ''Asia Times''. Last modified October 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his tenure in 2011, Hu appeared to extend the ideology to an international dimension, with a focus on the international peace and cooperation, which is said to lead to a "harmonious world" whereas the administration of Hu's successor, [[Xi Jinping]], has used the philosophy more sparingly, likely in favor of emphasizing his vision of the [[Chinese Dream]].

== History ==
The concept of harmony in Chinese culture comes from music. During the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, discussion of music flourished under Confucius and the school of thoughts he created, Confucianism. Confucianism played a key part in the formulation of the earliest form of Chinese music, Qin. Qin music illustrates the concept of harmony through its techniques such as the level of pressure and the speed of tempo, which symbolize Yin and Yang and the different temperature in the four seasons. The moderate unison of sounds maintains the perfect order and managing these opposing elements into a moderate piece of musical work is considered the best sound.&lt;ref&gt;Ko, Yi-Fang. "Confucianism in Qin Music." Chinese Music 29, no. 2 (2006): 32–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, one of the most influential works by Ru Jia (otherwise known as Book of Music), reads, "When the early rulers formed the li [rituals] and yue [music] their purpose was not to satisfy the mouth, stomach, ear and eye, but rather to teach the people to moderate their likes and hates, and bring them back to the correct direction in life."&lt;ref name="Arnold, Perris 1983"/&gt; Music, under Confucian concepts, has the power to transform people to become more civilized and the goal of music is to create balance within individuals, nature and society. Leading people "back to the correct direction in life" not only signifies the guiding role of music, but also emphasizes on the power of the rulers, "The correct 'mood' was set by the chief of state, the emperor, the son of Heaven."&lt;ref&gt;Perris, Arnold, "Music as Propaganda: Art at the Command of Doctrine in the People's Republic of China," Ethnomusicology, 27, no. 1 (1983): 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The power of the rulers reflects a fundamental theme in Chinese civilization. The State, or the ruling government, has the special role of taking care of the people; however, what distinguishes the Chinese ruling government from other ruling governments is the respectful attitude of the citizens, who regard the government as part of their family. In fact, the ruling government is "the head of the family, the patriarch."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Jacques: Understanding the Rise of China, video file, directed by Martin Jacques (London, UK: TED, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Chinese look to the government for guidance as if they are listening to their father who, according to Chinese tradition, enjoys high reverence from the rest of the family. Furthermore, "still another tradition that supports state control of music is the Chinese expectation of a verbal 'message.'"&lt;ref&gt;Perris, Arnold, "Music as Propaganda: Art at the Command of Doctrine in the People's Republic of China," Ethnomusicology, 27, no. 1 (1983): 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  A "verbal message" is the underlying meaning behind people's words. In order to get to the "verbal message," one needs to read into words and ask oneself what the desired or expected response would be. The Chinese tradition of reading into words makes it easier for the government, or "the father," who possesses more attention and respect, to pass down its wishes through songs.

==Political context==
{{further|Ideology of the Communist Party of China}}
The "Socialist Harmonious Society" concept represents a new direction of Chinese communist leadership that signified the transition between Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. Although on the surface, "socialist harmonious society" seems benign, many scholars believe that General Secretary Hu has a vision for a deeper reform of the political system in China.&lt;ref&gt;Geis, John and Blaine Holt. " 'Harmonious Society' Rise of the New China." Strategic Studies Quarterly 3, no. 4 (2009): 75–94.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the idea of scientific development stresses on scientific discovery and technological advance, engines for sustainable growth in the long run. Sustainable growth is a concept in macroeconomics that signifies GDP at potential (i.e. all that is produced is being consumed and there is no cyclical unemployment) for years to come.

In addition, the Socialist Harmonious Society concept was a response to the problem of social inequality/ wealth gap, which if not dealt with immediately, could lead to social unrest and even turmoil. A key reason contributing to a widening wealth gap was social injustice, which features collusion between entrepreneurs and officials. Through collusion, entrepreneurs were able to buy land from farmers and then sell it at high prices. Furthermore, with the protection of local officials, private coal mine owners ignored safety regulations to cut production costs. As a result, thousands of miners are killed in accidents.&lt;ref name=20061011atimes/&gt; Since the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], the leadership has been extremely sensitive about maintaining stability. General Secretary Hu's focus on stability and openness is the central model addressed in the book ''The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall'' by [[Ian Bremmer]]. According to Bremmer, the Chinese government is trying carefully to avoid instability by jumping from a controlled social environment on one end to complete openness on the other. The "J Curve" model is applicable to the political development of most nations and presents a choice between stability and openness. The concept of "Socialist Harmonious Society" is said to include both elements of the model. Hence, Hu's "socialist harmonious society" has an underlying message of establishing political reform as well as safeguarding social justice and equality.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==New interpretation==
Hu Jintao visited the US in early 2011, two years before he stepped down as the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] (the [[paramount leader]]). One of the key messages of his visit was the idea of peace and cooperation: "China and the United States have major influence in international affairs and shoulder important responsibilities in upholding world peace and promoting common development."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ian. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/world/asia/19hu.html “China's Leader Has Message of Harmony, but Limited Agenda.”]. ''The New York Times''. Last modified January 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to attending state dinners, President Hu visited the US China Business Council, a Chinese-owned auto parts plant in Ohio, and Walter Payton College Preparatory High School in Chicago/Confucius Institute of Chicago. When asked about the differences between the US and China at Walter Payton Prep, Hu Jintao responded, "China and the US have different histories, culture, social systems and levels of development, but their peoples are peace-loving and in pursuit of growth. I hope that the friendship between our two nations will last forever."&lt;ref name=hanban&gt;[http://english.hanban.org/article/2011-01/27/content_222445_2.htm "President Hu Jintao Paid a Visit to the Confucius Institute in Chicago News."] Hanban.org. January 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; With few agendas at hand before his retirement, Hu Jintao brought to America a concept of harmony that is based on peace, cooperation and "soft power" exchanges. [[Soft power]] is a concept developed by [[Joseph Nye]] to describe the ability to attract and cooperate rather than using coercion, force or money as a means of persuasion. The means of persuasion by using force or money, on the other hand, is called [[hard power]]. Nye, as a past [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs]] in the [[Clinton Administration]], stresses on the combination of soft power and hard power, which he calls [[smart power]]. Nye believes that the using of smart power in today's dynamic international relations will be highly effective.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Nye on Global Power Shift, video file, directed by Joseph Nye (Oxford, England: TED, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Now looking back at President Hu's visit to US and linking it with the multidimensional rise of Chinese influence on the international stage, one can discover the subtle similarity between Chinese and American foreign policies.

In addition to the utilization of smart power, the Chinese leader also understands the concept of "Shadow of the Future": At the high school, Hu Jintao told the students, "The young are the future of a nation and the hopes of the world. The prospects of China-US relations are in the hands of the young people of the two countries."&lt;ref name=hanban/&gt; "Shadow of the Future" is a concept in Joseph Nye's book, ''Understanding Global Conflict and Cooperation: An Introduction to Theory and History.'' The key to Shadow of the Future is to lengthen the period of peace and cooperation and to reduce fear of power conflicts. One of the paramount reasons that contributes to the [[Peloponnesian War]], according to [[Thucydides]], is "the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta." Hu's perspective claims to try to reduce the deadly psychological feeling in the nature of humans as well as nations.

On the other hand, the American foreign policy goes beyond the message of peace, understanding and cooperation. As the world's superpower, the United States has a tough stance on the rise of China. The appropriateness of such a tough stance, nevertheless, is debatable given the political environment at the time of American elections. During Hu's visit, President Barack Obama assured China that the US is reasserting its influence in East Asia and in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Fallows, James. [https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/01/a-final-state-dinnernote/69990/ “A Final State Dinner Note.”] ''The Atlantic'', January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the US has increased its military and political presence in the Pacific through its military deployment in Australia and its diplomatic/military pressure on the sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea in early 2012.

The administration of Hu's successor, [[Xi Jinping]], has used the phrase more sparingly. It was mentioned only once in the resolutions passed by the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee.

==Criticism and satire==
While initially the public's reaction to the idea was positive, over the years "Harmonious Society" has emerged as a euphemism for "stability at all costs," and has garnered its share of critics. The government often uses "Harmonious Society" to justify the suppression of dissent and the tight control on information in China. Some social commentators have pointed out the irony that in building a "harmonious society" the country has become less just, less equal, and less fair.&lt;ref name=Hux&gt;{{cite web|last=Hu|first=Xingdou|title=胡星斗：建议取消"和谐社会"的提法|url=http://www.newcenturynews.com/Article/gd/201107/20110714135748.html|publisher=New Century News|accessdate=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, some of Hu's critics say that application of the "Socialist Harmonious Society" concept has resulted in anything but itself.&lt;ref name=chengli&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Cheng|author2=Eve Cary|title=The Last Year of Hu's Leadership: Hu's to Blame?|journal=Jamestown Foundation: China Brief|date=December 20, 2011|volume=11|issue=23|url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=38811&amp;cHash=c0006cd99bfe551991fcf1924d37c0cf|accessdate=January 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; China scholar Cheng Li said that Hu's failure in implementing the Socialist Harmonious Society program has been his "gravest pitfall" during his tenure.&lt;ref name=chengli/&gt; Critics cite the increased wealth gap, higher internal security budgets, and unprecedented corruption in state-owned industries as evidence that Socialist Harmonious Society has failed in practice.&lt;ref name=chengli/&gt;

The term "[[River crab (Internet slang)|River crab]]" ({{zh|s=河蟹|p=héxiè}}) has been adopted as internet slang in Mainland China in reference to [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|Internet censorship]].  The word ''river crab'' sounds similar to the word "harmonious" in [[Mandarin Chinese]]. In addition, the word "harmonious" can itself also be the placeholder verb for "to censor", most often referring to posts on a forum that have been deleted because of its unacceptable content, or the censorship of stories reporting sensitive issues in the press. Something that has been censored in this manner is often referred to as having been "harmonized" (被和谐了).

'''Herri Urrats''' (Basque for 'a people's step') is an annual festival held the second Sunday of May to reach out to the ''[[ikastolak]]'' ('Basque language schools') in the [[Northern Basque Country]], [[France]].&lt;ref name=eke.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Herri Urrats|url=http://www.eke.org/fr/partaideak/herri_urrats|work=eke.org: Le portail de la culture basque|accessdate=29 February 2012|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="euskalkultura_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 London Herri Urrats|url=http://www.euskalkultura.com/photo-gallery/england/2010-london-herri-urrats/view?set_language=en|work=Euskalkultura.com: Basque Heritage Worldwid (BETA)|accessdate=2 March 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sud_Ouest"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pays basque : Herri Urrats 2018 au profit du collège de Larceveau|url=https://www.sudouest.fr/2018/04/26/pays-basque-herri-urrats-2018-au-profit-du-college-de-larceveau-5009246-4018.php|accessdate=27 May 2018|work=Sud Ouest|date=26 April 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Southern Basque Country]] ([[Spain]]), Basque is taught in all public schools, but in the French Basque Country, students wishing to be taught in Basque must attend an ''ikastola school''.&lt;ref name="euskalkultura_a"/&gt;

==History==
The first festival was held in 1984 in the town of [[Saint-Pée-sur-Nivelle]] (''Senpere'' in Basque). The small town has come to be renowned for its regular Herri Urrats celebration, which remains one of the largest of its kind.&lt;ref name="euskosare"&gt;{{cite web|last=Benoit |first=Etxeberri |title=Herri Urrats 2006, the living example of Euskara, to take place around the lake at Saint Pée sur Nivelle on May 14 |url=http://www.euskosare.org/euskara/herri_urrats_2006_living_example_of_euskara |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414160503/http://www.euskosare.org/euskara/herri_urrats_2006_living_example_of_euskara |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-14 |work=euskosare.org Basque Global Community network |accessdate=29 February 2012 |others=Idoya Urruty (trans.) |date=2006-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Herri Urrats consists basically of a walk around the Saint-Pée lake.&lt;ref name="euskosare" /&gt; The circuit laid out around an artificial lake is dotted with food stands and entertainment all along. Walkers sometimes march in support of an organization.&lt;ref name="euskosare" /&gt; 

Its first edition was attended by five thousand people, but in later years the attendance has risen as high as seventy thousand. In 2011, the money collected was used to fund the Kanbo Xalbador Ikastola. The funds collected provide financial support to the Basque schools across the three traditional provinces of Iparralde ([[French Basque Country]]): [[Lapurdi]], [[Lower Navarre]] and [[Zuberoa]]. Contributions of participants and popular subscription have helped build twenty-five [[ikastola]]s, three primary schools, and one secondary school. The festival also celebrates [[Basque people|Basque]] culture and language.

==World celebration==
Herri Urrats is celebrated in many major cities the world over, including [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]],&lt;ref name=euskalkultura&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebration of Herri Urrats, traditional festival to help Basque language schools in the Northern Basque Country|url=http://www.euskalkultura.com/agenda/celebration-of-herri-urrats-traditional-festival-to-help-basque-language-schools-in-the-northern-basque-country/view?set_language=en|work=Euskalkultura.com: Basque Heritage Worldwide (BETA)|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paris]] and [[London]].&lt;ref name="euskalkultura_a" /&gt;

Paul (ed.), 2009. ''Ethnologue: Languages of the World'', Sixteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version: http://www.ethnologue.com/.&lt;/ref&gt; They speak [[Tagdal]], a mixed [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]–[[Northern Songhay languages|Songhay]] language. The Igdalen are closely related to [[Idaksahak people]] of eastern [[Mali]] and the [[Sawaq people|Sawaq]] of [[Ingal]] in Niger, with whom they share a very similar language. Culturally, the Igdalen are often considered a [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] faction. In the past they have formed a sub-confederation with the [[Kel Fadey]], [[Kel Ferwan]] and others in the [[Kel Ayr]] Tuareg confederation or ''Drum Group''.&lt;ref name=bernus1972&gt;Edmond Bernus, Suzanne Bernus. [http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/divers11-02/05791.pdf Du sel et des dattes: introduction à l'étude de la communauté d'In Gall et de Tegidda-n-tesemt]. ''Etudes Nigeriennes'', 31. Centre nigérien de recherches en sciences humaines, 1972. OCLC 248836480&lt;/ref&gt;

There are an estimated 27,000 Igdalen,&lt;ref name=ethno2009 /&gt; and are centered on [[Tanout]] and [[Tchin Tabaraden]] in northern Niger, although seasonal transhumance with livestock take them well north and south.&lt;ref name=bernus1972 /&gt; Igdalen are Muslim, and have previously been a [[Marabout]] (religious) and herding caste within Tuareg society.&lt;ref name=bernus1972 /&gt;

The Igdalen do not form a single political or tribal group, but factions are through recent history attached to at least two aristocratic Tuareg tribes. These include the [[Kel Ferwan]] ''Immuzurag'' and ''Ikherkheren''.&lt;ref name=bernus1972 /&gt; In the Ingal area, the Igdalen are divided into two additional tribes, the ''Kel Tofey'' and the ''Kel Amdit''.&lt;ref name=bernus1972 /&gt;

The Igdalen are believed to have been among the first Berber people to move into the area, before large Tuareg groups migrated from the 11th to the 16th centuries CE. It is believed that Igdalen came to the Niger river valley from Morocco by the 11th century, moving up towards the [[Aïr Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;James Stuart Olson.

'''Italian settlers in Libya''' ({{lang-it|Italo-libici}}, also called '''Italian Libyans''') typically refers to Italians, and their descendants, who resided or were born in [[Italian Libya]], in the colonial period preceding independent [[Libya]].

==History==
Italian heritage in Libya can be dated back to [[Ancient Rome]], when the Romans controlled and [[Roman Libya|colonized Libya for a period of more than five centuries]] prior to the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] and its takeover by [[Arab]] and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] civilizations. But predominantly Italian heritage in Libya refers to modern-day Italians.

In 1911, the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] waged war on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and captured Libya as a colony. Italian settlers were encouraged to come to Libya and did so from 1911 until the outbreak of World War II.

===Developments===
[[File:Italo-Turkish War peace treaty chromolithograph.jpg|thumb|250px|An idealized image of the take over of [[Ottoman Tripolitania]] by Italy in 1911.]]
In less than thirty years (1911–1940), the Italians in Libya built a significant amount of public works (roads, railways, buildings, ports, etc.) and the Libyan economy flourished. They even created the [[Tripoli Grand Prix]], an international motor racing event first held in 1925 on a racing circuit outside Tripoli (it lasted until 1940).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEtz-wzbs9Y Video of Tripoli Grand Prix]&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian farmers cultivated lands that had returned to native desert for many centuries, and improved Italian Libya's agriculture to international standards (even with the creation of new farm villages).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecturebeyond.eu/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/vittoria-capresi_I-centri-rurali-libici.pdf New villages in coastal Libya (in Italian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720153207/http://www.architecturebeyond.eu/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/vittoria-capresi_I-centri-rurali-libici.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholicism in Libya|Catholicism]] experienced a huge growth in those years, with many new churches built for the growing Italian community: in the late 1920s the two catholic Cathedrals of [[Tripoli Cathedral|Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi Cathedral|Benghazi]] were built. The one in Benghazi was considered the biggest in north Africa.

The governor [[Italo Balbo]] is attributed with the creation of modern Libya in 1934, when he convinced Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] to unite the Italian colonies of [[Tripolitania]], [[Italian Cyrenaica|Cirenaica]] and the [[Fezzan]] into one single country named "Libia" in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Balbo, called "Father of Libya" in ''Taylor, Blaine. Fascist Eagle: Italy's Air Marshal Italo Balbo''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emigrants===
Libya was considered the new "America" for the Italian emigrants in the 1930s, substituting the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Favero, Luigi e Tassello, Graziano. ''Cent'anni di emigrazione italiana (1876-1976)''. Cser. Roma, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italians in Libya numbered 108,419 (12.37% of the total population) at the time of the 1939 census. They were concentrated in the coast around the city of Tripoli (they constituted 37% of the city's population) and Benghazi (31%).

In 1938, Governor Balbo brought 20,000 Italian farmers to colonize Libya, and 26 new villages were founded for them, mainly in Cyrenaica.&lt;ref&gt;In 1938 20,000 Italian colonists settled in coastal Libya. Italian authorities created 26 new agricultural villages for them: Olivetti, Bianchi, Giordani, Micca, Tazzoli, Breviglieri, Marconi, Garabulli, Crispi, Corradini, Garibaldi, Littoriano, [[Castel Benito]], Filzi, Baracca, Maddalena, Aro, Oberdan, D’Annunzio, Razza, Mameli, Battisti, Berta, Luigi di Savoia and Gioda.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 1939, the colony of Libya was incorporated into metropolitan Italy and thereafter considered an integral part of the Italian state. Libya, as the [[Fourth Shore]], was to be part of the [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Imperial Italy]], desired by the [[Italia irredenta|Italian irredentists]].

By 1939 the Libyan Italians had built 400&amp;nbsp;km of new railroads and 4,000&amp;nbsp;km of new roads (the largest and most important was the one from Tripoli to Tobruk, on the coast) in Libya.

;''Libya: A Country Study''
:Helen Chapin Metz wrote in her book titled ''Libya: A Country Study'' the following observations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
..."Once pacification had been accomplished, [[National Fascist Party|Fascist Italy]] endeavored to convert Libya into an Italian province to be referred to popularly as Italy's Fourth Shore. In 1934 [[Italian Tripolitania|Tripolitania]] and [[Italian Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]] were divided into [[Provinces of Libya|four provinces]]--Tripoli, Misrata, Benghazi, and Darnah--which were formally linked as a single colony known as Italian Libya, thus officially resurrecting the name that Diocletian had applied nearly 1,500 years earlier. Fezzan, designated as South Tripolitania, remained a military territory. A governor general, called the first consul after 1937, was in overall direction of the colony, assisted by the General Consultative Council, on which Arabs were represented. Traditional tribal councils, formerly sanctioned by the Italian administration, were abolished, and all local officials were thereafter appointed by the governor general. Administrative posts at all levels were held by Italians. 
{{-}}
{{-}}
An accord with Britain and Egypt obtained the transfer of a corner of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], known as the Sarra Triangle, to Italian control in 1934. The next year, a French-Italian agreement was negotiated that relocated the 1,000-kilometer border between Libya and Chad southward about 100 kilometers across the [[Aouzou Strip]], but this territorial concession to Italy was never ratified by the French legislature. 
{{-}}
{{-}}
In 1939 Libya was incorporated into metropolitan Italy. During the 1930s, impressive strides were made in improving the country's economic and transportation infrastructure. Italy invested capital and technology in [[public works]] projects, extension and modernization of cities, highway and railroad construction, expanded port facilities, and [[irrigation]], but these measures were introduced to benefit the Italian-controlled modern sector of the economy. Italian development policy after World War I had called for capital-intensive "economic colonization" intended to promote the maximum exploitation of the resources available. 
{{-}}
{{-}}
One of the initial Italian objectives in Libya, however, had been the relief of overpopulation and unemployment in Italy through [[emigration]] to the undeveloped colony. With security established, systematic "demographic colonization" was encouraged by Mussolini's government. A project initiated by Libya's governor, Italo Balbo, brought the first 20,000 settlers — the ''ventimilli'' — to Libya in a single convoy in October 1938. More settlers followed in 1939, and by 1940 there were approximately 110,000 Italians in Libya, constituting about 12 percent of the total population. Plans envisioned an Italian colony of 500,000 settlers by the 1960s. 
{{-}}
{{-}}
Libya's best land was allocated to the settlers to be brought under productive cultivation, primarily in [[olive grove]]s. Settlement was directed by a state corporation, the Libyan Colonization Society, which undertook land reclamation and the building of model villages and offered a grubstake and credit facilities to the settlers it had sponsored. The Italians made modern medical care available for the first time in Libya, improved sanitary conditions in the towns, and undertook to replenish the herds and flocks that had been depleted during the war. But, although Mussolini liked to refer to the Libyans as "Muslim Italians," little more was accomplished that directly improved the living standards of the Arab population.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==World War II==
In 1940 [[World War II]] broke out between Italy and [[Great Britain]]. The defeat of the [[Axis forces]] in the [[North African Campaign]]s of World War II meant Italy lost Libya to British and French control. After these [[Western Desert Campaign]] defeats in 1941, Italy was forced to abandon its colonial intentions and projects.

===After World War II===

From 1943 to 1951, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were under British administration, while the French controlled Fezzan. Under the terms of the 1947 peace treaty with the Allies, Italy relinquished all claims to Libya. On November 21, 1949, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution stating that Libya should become independent before January 1, 1952. On December 24, 1951, Libya declared its independence as the United Kingdom of Libya, a constitutional and hereditary monarchy. The Italian population virtually disappeared after the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi ordered the expulsion of remaining Italians (about 20,000) in 1970. {{See|Day of Revenge (Libya)}} Only a few hundred of them have been allowed to return to Libya in the 2000s.

On 30 August 2008, Gaddafi and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi signed a historic cooperation treaty in Benghazi. Under its terms, Italy would pay $5 billion to Libya as compensation for its former military occupation.In exchange, Libya would take measures to combat illegal immigration coming from its shores and boost investments in Italian companies. The treaty was ratified by Italy on 6 February 2009, and by Libya on 2 March, during a visit to Tripoli by Berlusconi. Co-operation ended in February 2011 as a result of the Libyan Civil War which overthrew Gaddafi. At the signing ceremony of the document, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi recognized historic atrocities and repression committed by the state of Italy against the Libyan people during colonial rule, stating: "In this historic document, Italy apologizes for its killing, destruction and repression of the Libyan people during the period of colonial rule." and went on to say that this was a "complete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on Libya by Italy during the colonial era".&lt;ref&gt;[[Italian Libya#After World War II]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}}

==21st century==
Only a few hundred Italians have been allowed to return to Libya in the 2000s (decade). In 2006 the Italian embassy in Tripoli calculated that there were approximately 1,000 original Libyan Italians in Libya, mostly elderly people living in Tripoli and Benghazi. After the [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) has been responsible for the transition of the administration of the governing of Libya in 2011, some Italo-Libyan refugees in Italy who were expelled by Gaddafi returned to Libya.

There are also many descendants (probably 10,000, according to estimates of Italian historian Vidali) of Italian settlers who married Arabs and/or Berbers, and Libyans of mixed Italian and Arab/Berber blood may be considered Arabs or Berbers in the Libyan census.

At present, the Libyan Italians are organized in the ''Associazione Italiani Rimpatriati dalla Libia''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airl.it Associazione Italiani Rimpatriati dalla Libia]&lt;/ref&gt; They are involved in a struggle to have their confiscated properties returned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airl.it/beta/chi_siamo_nostra.php History of the Italian refugees from Gheddafi Libya (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qadir Bukhsh Rind Baloch''' (known as '''Kadu Makrani''') was a nineteenth-century [[insurgent]] in [[Kathiawar]], [[Gujarat]] and raised in [[Makran]], [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. He had opposed British Imperialist rule and rule by the elite class of Gujarat in favor of the rights of the poor.

Qadir Bukhsh Rind Baloch was martyred and buried in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]] in 1887, with his final resting place in [[Mewa Shah Graveyard|Mewah Shah Graveyard]] ([[Lyari]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://baluchsarmachar.wordpress.com/2009/09/11/kadu-makrani-a-national-hero/comment-page-1/ Kadu Makrani A National Hero]&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants of Makrani still live in Junagadh, Veraval, Jamnagar (Gujarat) and Lyari (Karachi). Today, many people visit Kadu Makrani's final resting place to pay respect and remember him and his fight against Imperialism.

==History==
===British Imperialist Conflict===
Kadu Makrani migrated with his tribe from his birthplace to Kathiawar, Gujarat during the mid-nineteenth century. Makrani and his tribe fought for territories and resources, receiving tribute from the Nawabs of Kathiawar in return. The ascension of Makrani's tribe troubled [[British Empire|Imperialists]], who sought to disarm and disable his tribe; a false reason was given when Makrani and his tribe rejected Government social workers entering their homes on the pretense of registration and census. Given the option of armistice or dissension, the tribe rebelled. Makrani's small army with civilian support overcame British Imperialist forces, with many fatalities. British Imperialist forces ultimately failed to counter Makrani's army, although announced a [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] of Rs1,000/- and a 20-acre (81,000 m2) land reward for his head.

===Return home===
[[File:KaduStone.JPG|thumb|The stone dropped on Makrani, preserved next to his grave.]]
In late 1887, Makrani’s companions suggested returning to Makran to ease British pressure in Kathiawar. Accepting the advice, the tribe moved onto [[Ahmedabad]] and then to [[Sindh]]. A camel herder agreed to transport him to Makran, yet sought to betray him in return for the bounty reward; Makrani slewed him and fled. Makrani was later captured unconscious after being brought down by a falling stone, and after a short mock trial was sentenced to death.

==Death==
[[File:KaduFinal.JPG|thumb|Final resting place of Kadu Makrani.]]
Kadu Makrani was executed in the Karachi central jail in 1887. He was buried in Mewah Shah Graveyard.

==In popular culture==
In 1960, Sadhana Chitra Film Company (India) made a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] film titled "Kadu Makrani" to pay tribute to Makrani, directed by Manhar Rangildas Raskapur starring Arvind Ganpatram Pandya in the lead role of Makrani.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0264745|Kadu Makrani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4221">The '''Ukelle''' people make up roughly half of the population of the [[Yala, Nigeria|Yala]] Local Government Area in [[Cross River State]], [[Nigeria]]. Ukelle people also live in Nigeria's states of [[Ebonyi State|Ebonyi]] (Effiom, Ntezi and Okpoto - who are also called Effiom or Uffiom) and the state of [[Benue State|Benue]] (Utonkon - who are called Uffia people). The language of the Ukelle people is Kukelle.

The major groups among the Ukelle are: Wanihem (including Wanibolor), Wanikade (including Uzenyi), Wanokom (including Otikili) and Uzekwe (including Okom), all in North Ukelle, and Uzilagar (Ijiraga), Uzikatom, Uzokom (Ujokom) and Otiligom (Ntrigom) in South Ukelle. For those in Cross River State of Nigeria as well as  Effiom (Uffiom) and Uffia in Ebonyi and Benue States of Nigeria.{{clarify|date=May 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;P. Amauray Talbot, ''The Peoples of southern Nigeria; Volume 2 Enthnology''. Frank Cass and Co, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
Kukelle, the language of Ukelle people is grouped by some authorities as belonging to the [[Benue–Congo languages|Benue–Congo]] sub group of African Languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Joseph|title=The Languages of Africa|year=1966|publisher=Indiana University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, E. Alagoa in ''Groundwork of Nigerian History'' further defined Ukelle people as those who speak one of the [[Cross River languages]].

The Lutheran Church of Nigeria, through its Literature Centre in Wanikade, translated the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]] into Kukelle in 1979.

== History ==
The history of Ukelle is still sketchy. Some argue that their ancestors moved downwards from Benue state, others contend that the ancestors may have moved from the [[Igboland|Igbo country]]. Ukelle people share sociocultural similarities with the neighbouring [[Igede]] people of Benue state and [[Yala, Nigeria|Yala]] people of Cross River state.&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Alagoa, ''Groundwork of Nigerian History''; Obaro Ikime (ed) Heinemann Books, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Major ceremonies such as marriage, burials and dances bear striking resemblances. Ukelle people refer to Yala people as Ollah, Igede people as Ollah-ewoh and the [[Idoma people]] of Benue state as Ollah-akpoto.

== Location ==
The Ukelle region is bounded in the north by the Igede people of Benue state, in the south by the [[Izzi people]] of [[Ebonyi State]] and in the east by the Yala and Yatche people of [[Cross River State]]. Much of Ukelle land in Cross River State is agrarian. However, development and urbanisation are coming into Ukelle. The provision of electricity in north Ukelle and the construction of bridges into the hinterlands of Ukelle are signs of urbanisation. [[Yam (vegetable)|Yam]] (various species), [[cassava]], rice and domesticated animals are the primary agricultural products of the Ukelle people.

== Government and culture==
In the Ukelle region, the day-to-day Government authority at the local level resides in the village assembly (called ''ojilla''). The village assembly is made up of the king or one or more chiefs, the elders and the youths. In earlier times, a typical Ukelle community had a village square, with the ''ojilla'' at its center. Until any settlement of Ukelle people makes an ''ojilla'', they are considered an appendage of the nearest [[Cross River State]]t community with an ''ojilla''. In fact, the term ''ojilla'' is used interchangeably to refer to the village, its square or the village assembly.

The burial of an{{clarify|date=May 2012}} Ukelle man or woman is the responsibility of the deceased family and of the village.

A group of villages make up a clan (called an ''essam''). For example, in Wanikade, there are three essam: Ogumogum, Otuka and Opuolom respectively.  Disputes within each village are adjudicated by the assembly, while disputes between villages within a clan are settled by the assembly of the clan. Disputes between villages in more than one essam as well as matters such as [[capital punishment]], economic use of trees, the forest, rivers etc. are resolved at the general assembly called 
 lutse. The king or chief wields ceremonial power rather than political power.

[[South Sudan]] is a multilingual country, with over 60 [[indigenous language]]s spoken. The official language of the country is [[English language|English]] which was introduced in the region during the [[colonisation of Africa|colonial era]] (''see [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]'').

The indigenous languages with the most speakers are [[Dinka language|Dinka]], [[Nuer language|Nuer]], [[Bari language|Bari]], [[Zande language|Zande]].

Both English and [[Juba Arabic]], an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[pidgin]] used by several thousand people especially in the capital city of [[Juba]], serve as [[lingua franca]]s.

==Official language==
Prior to independence the 2005 interim constitution of the [[Southern Sudan Autonomous Region (2005–11)|Southern Sudan Autonomous Region]] declared in Part 1, Chapter 1, No. 6 (2) that “English and [[Arabic]] shall be the official working languages at the level of the governments of Southern Sudan and the States as well as languages of instruction for higher education“.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chr.up.ac.za/undp/domestic/docs/c_SouthernSudan.pdf ''The Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan'', 2005] (PDF; 484&amp;nbsp;kB), Part One, Page.&amp;nbsp;3–4, No. 6 (1), (2), retrieved 6 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of the new independed state later deleted Arabic as an official language and chose English as the sole official language. Part One, 6(2) of the transitional constitution of the Republic of South Sudan of 2011 states that "English shall be the official working language in the Republic of South Sudan".&lt;ref name="engwork"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goss-online.org/magnoliaPublic/en/home/mainColumnParagraphs/0/content_files/file/FINAL%20TCRSS.doc |title=The Transitional Constitution of the Republic of South Sudan, 2011 |accessdate=12 July 2011 |publisher=Government of South Sudan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://swap.stanford.edu/20110721121619/http://www.goss-online.org/magnoliaPublic/en/home/mainColumnParagraphs/0/content_files/file/FINAL%20TCRSS.doc |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goss-online.org/magnoliaPublic/en/about/ataglance.html |archive-url=https://swap.stanford.edu/20110628170437/http%3A//www.goss%2Donline.org/magnoliaPublic/en/about/ataglance.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 June 2011 |title=At a Glance |date=12 July 2011 |work=Official portal |publisher=Government of Southern Sudan |accessdate=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous languages==
[[File:Lenguas nilo-saharianas.PNG|thumb|right|400px|African map of the [[Nilo-Saharan languages]]. The [[Eastern Sudanic languages|Eastern]] and [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic]] branches dominate in South Sudan.]]
There are over 60 indigenous languages spoken in South Sudan. Most of the indigenous languages are classified under the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language family]]; collectively, they represent two of the first order divisions of Nilo-Saharan (Eastern Sudanic and Central Sudanic). The remainder belong to the [[Ubangi languages]] of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo language family]], and they are spoken in the southwest.

The most recent available population statistics for many South Sudan indigenous languages go back to the 1980s. Since then, the war of independence led to many civilian deaths and massive displacement of refugees to [[Sudan]] and beyond. Due to the drafting of colonial borders in Africa by European powers during the 19th and 20th centuries, some indigenous languages of South Sudan are spoken in neighboring countries, in some cases more so than in South Sudan. Zande, for example is estimated to have twice as many speakers in the neighboring [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], while the [[Banda languages|Banda group of languages]] may have more speakers in the [[Central African Republic]] than in South Sudan.

In South Sudan, the languages with the most speakers are [[Nuer language|Nuer]] with 740,000 speakers in 1982, and [[Dinka language|Dinka]] [[sociolinguistic language]] or [[dialect continuum]] with perhaps 1.4 million in 1986; these two groups of languages are also closely related to one another.

==Indigenous language loss==
Since 1950, three South Sudanese indigenous languages have become extinct, no longer having even ceremonial use - [[Togoyo]], [[Mittu]], and [[Homa (ritual)|Homa]].&lt;ref&gt;ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 68 living languages recognized by [[ethnologue]], 17 are categorized as "in danger." [[Boguru]] is used only ceremonially. Aja and [[Mangayat]] have only elderly speakers who rarely have the opportunity to use the languages.&lt;ref&gt;ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt;

West Central [[Banda languages|Banda]], [[Indri]], and [[Njalgulgule]] are used commonly among the elderly, but no members of the child-bearing generation speak them actively. An additional 9 languages are not being transferred to children, and although [[Bonga]] and [[Lokoya language|Lokoya]] are spoken by all generations within their population, they are rapidly losing users.&lt;ref&gt;ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-indigenous languages==
During the [[Rejaf Conference]] held in April 1928 during the Anglo-Egyptian condominium it was decided that schooling in the South would be in the [[English language]]. Although after independence the Sudan government tried to replace English with Arabic, part of the peace agreement in 1972 ensured that English continued as the medium of education in most schools in southern Sudan. English is widely spoken by those who have had the opportunity of going to school, either within South Sudan or in the diaspora.

South Sudan's ambassador to [[Kenya]] said on 2 August 2011 that [[Swahili language|Swahili]] will be introduced in South Sudan with the goal of supplanting Arabic as a ''[[lingua franca]]'', in keeping with the country's intention of orientation toward the [[East African Community]] rather than Sudan and the [[Arab League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.coastweek.com/kenxin_110805_04.htm |agency=Coastweek |date=5 August 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2011 |title=South Sudanese still in Kenya despite new state |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929171421/http://www.coastweek.com/kenxin_110805_04.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, South Sudan submitted an application to join the Arab League as a [[Member states of the Arab League|member state]] on 25 March 2014, which is still pending.&lt;ref&gt;[[Middle East Monitor]]: [https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20140412-south-sudan-and-chad-apply-to-join-the-arab-league ''South Sudan and Chad apply to join the Arab League''], 12 April 2014, retrieved 3 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the newspaper [[Asharq Al-Awsat]], the Foreign Minister of South Sudan [[Deng Alor Kuol]] said: South Sudan is the closest African country to the [[Arab world]], and we speak a special kind of Arabic known as Juba Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]: [http://english.aawsat.com/ahmedyounis/interviews/foreign-minister-south-sudan-considering-joining-arab-league ''Foreign Minister of South Sudan: We Are Considering Joining the Arab League''], 7 June 2016, retrieved 3 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Sudan supports South Sudan’s request to join the Arab League.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sudan Tribune]]: [http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article59689 ''Khartoum supports South Sudan demand to join Arab League''], 21 July 2016, retrieved 3 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of South Sudanese refugees who were raised in [[Cuba]] during the Sudanese wars, numbering about 600, also speak fluent [[Spanish Language|Spanish]]. They have been named the ''Cubanos'', and most had settled in Juba by the time of the country's independence.&lt;ref&gt;Radio France International, [http://www.espanol.rfi.fr/africa/20110706-los-cubanos-la-elite-del-sudan-del-sur "Los cubanos, la élite de Sudán del Sur".

In the [[States of South Sudan|state]] of [[Western Bahr el Ghazal]], in its border region with the neighboring country of Sudan, there is an indeterminate number of [[Baggara Arabs]] (traditionally [[Nomad|nomadic people]]) that resides either seasonally or permanently. Their language is [[Chadian Arabic]] and their traditional territories are in the southern portions of the Sudanese regions of [[Kurdufan]] and [[Darfur]]. In the capital, Juba, there are several thousand people who use an Arabic [[pidgin]], [[Juba Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tosco |first=Mauro |year=1995 |title=A Pidgin Verbal System: The Case of Juba Arabic |journal=Anthropological Linguistics |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=423–459|jstor=30028330|url=http://www.maurotosco.net/maurotosco/Publications_files/TOSCO_1995_JA%20VERBAL%20SYSTEM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arabic dialectology specialist Alan S.

* For some, /n/ and /ŋ/ alternate freely. However, majority of Kéo speakers use /ŋ/.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* /h/ is sometimes heard at the beginning of vowel-initial words.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Phonotactics ===

==== Simple Words ====
* There is no distinction between a grammatical and phonological word (''Eg. e - think'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Compound Words ====
* Compounds consist of two simple words (''Eg. gidi-geo- to spin'')&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Stress &amp; Intonation ===
* Stress in Kéo is often predictable - it usually falls on the ultimate syllable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Intonation could depends on the force of speech and a speaker's emotional state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Grammar ==

=== [[Pronouns]] &amp; Person Marking ===

[[Personal pronouns]] replace [[proper nouns]] or other nouns, and form a [[closed word class]]. They are highly dependent on context, and are used to indicate if one is referring to the speaker, listener, etc. (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;108).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are five subclasses of nouns; 1) [[common nouns]], 2) kin terms, 3) place names, 4) personal names and 5) personal pronouns (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;101–102).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, unlike [[English language|English]], where [[pronouns]] are an independent part of the language, personal pronouns are included under the noun class in Kéo (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;97).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, all five of these subclasses, including personal pronouns, may be used as nominal [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;101).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Personal Pronouns ====
===== Standard Forms =====

In Kéo, there is no change in the personal pronoun, even if they are independent pronouns, [[subject (grammar)|subject]]s, [[object (grammar)|object]]s, [http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPossessivePronoun.htm possessors], etc. (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;108).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, first, second, third, (and [[singular homology|singular]] and [[plural]] forms) have differences, and the first person plural pronoun has an inclusive and exclusive form. Apart from the first and second person singular pronoun, pronouns may be followed by numbers to quantify the pronoun. Gender is also not differentiated in Kéo pronouns (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;109).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''First person [[pronouns]]'''
''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''
The standard forms of 1st person singular [[pronouns]] are ''nga'o;'' which is 1st singular, ''kita;'' 1st person plural inclusive, and ''kami;'' 1st person [[plural]] exclusive. This can be used to express I, me, my, etc. (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;110).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example:

{{space|type}}

{|
|(1)
|'''''Nga’o'''''
|''mbana.''
|
|-
|
|1sg
|walk
|
|-
|
|I'm walking.
|
|
|}
(Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;110)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{space|type}}

{|
|''Kepa''
| ''kiki''
| '''''nga’o'''.''
|-
|Mosquito
|bite
|1sg
|-
|A mosquito
|bit
|me.
|}
(Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;110)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{space|type}}

* '''Second person [[pronouns]]'''
The standard forms of 2nd person singular [[pronouns]] are ''kau;'' which is 2nd perseon [[singular homology|singular]] and ''miu;'' 2nd person [[plural]]. This can be used to express you, your, etc. (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;110).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example:

{{space|type}}

{|
|''Tuka''
|'''''kau'''''
|''bhu.''
|-
|stomach
|2sg
|bloated
|-
|Your stomach
|is 
|bloated.
|}
(Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;119).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{space|type}}

* '''Third person [[pronouns]]'''
The standard forms of 3rd person [[singular homology|singular]] [[pronouns]] are ''’imu;'' which is 3rd person [[singular homology|singular]] and ''’imu ko'o;'' 3rd person [[plural]]. This can be used as he, her, etc. (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;110).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example:

{{space|type}}

{|
|'''''’Imu'''''
|''mbhana.''
|-
|3sg
|go
|-
|He 
|went.
|}
(Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;116).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{space|type}}

{|
|''’Ana''
|'''''’imu'''''
|''bhugé''
|''ré’é-ré’é''
|-
|children
|3sg
|fat
|very
|-
|Her 
|children
|are very
|fat.
|-
|
|
|
|
|}
(Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;119).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{space|type}}

A sentence can also be made to be less ambiguous by using ''’imu'' possessively. (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;328).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In other words, using a pronoun in this way can make the meaning of a sentence clearer to the listener:

{{space|type}}

1)     ''Nambu wado Australia Peter ongga dhoa kumi,''

When go home Australia Peter shave lose beard

When Peter went home to Australia he shaved off a beard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{space|type}}

2)     ''Nambu wado Australia Peter ongga dhoa kumi '''’imu'''.''

When go home Australia Peter shave lose beard 3sg

When Peter returned home to Australia he shaved off his beard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{space|type}}

As seen in the examples (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;328)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; above, 2) clarifies the meaning of 1) with the addition of ''’imu,'' as it shows the beard is Peter’s beard.

Below is an example of both a 1st singular pronoun and a 3rd singular pronoun being used in the same sentence:

{{space|type}}

  {|
|'''''Nga’o'''''
|''mbhana.''
|
|
|-
|1sg
|hit
|3sg
|
|-
|I 
|hit
|him.
|
|-
|
|
|
|
|}
(Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;110).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{space|type}}

===== Alternate Forms =====

There are also alternate forms of personal pronouns, which are used for different reasons. There are three main reasons as to why alternate [[pronouns]] are used. Firstly, alternate pronouns may be used to indicate politeness, or to avoid social taboo. Secondly, they may be used based on dialect variations. Lastly, certain pronouns are used to identify the exact number of people there are in the situation being described or talked about (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;111).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Baird (2002)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; highlighted four alternate forms of personal pronouns used in Kéo; ''ja'o, miu, kita,'' and ''sira'' (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;111–114).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first alternate form, ''ja'o,'' is an alternate form of the first person singular pronoun, ''nga'o'' (standard form). Initially'','' each dialect group used either one exclusively, and was a way to identify which Kéo -speaking area one was from. However, the use of the standard and alternate form of the pronoun no longer has this ability to establish one’s dialect group (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;111).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This will be further discussed below in ''Regional Varieties.''

The second alternate form is ''miu.'' It is often used in reference to more than one person, but can also be used to address one person as an [[honorific]]. (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;112).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example:

{{space|type}}

{|
|''’Iné''
|'''''miu'''''
|''ta''
|''ndia.''
|-
|ma’am
|2.pl
|[[relativiser]]
|here
|-
|Ma’am,
|you stay here
|(while I go).
|
|}
(Baird, 2002, pp. 112).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{space|type}}

The third alternate form is ''kita'' (Baird, 2002, pp. 113).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As mentioned above, first person plural pronouns have an exclusive and inclusive form in Kéo (Baird, 2002, pp. 110).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the alternate and inclusive form, ''kita,'' frequently replaces ''kami'' (the exclusive form). Using the inclusive form (''kita'') instead of the exclusive form (''kami'') helps the speaker to seem more generous and selfless, as they are including the listener in their speech. Especially when discussing property and personal possessions, the speaker can sound less arrogant by using the inclusive term instead of the exclusive term.  (Baird, 2002, pp. 113).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example:

{{space|type}}

{|
|''Kamba''
|''ko’o'' 
|sai?
|Kaba
|'''kita.'''
|-
|Bufffalo
|POSS
|who
|buffalo
|1.pl.incl
|-
|Whose water buffalo
|are
|these?
|Our water
|buffalo.
|-
|
|
|
|
|
|}
(Baird, 2002, pp. 113).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{space|type}}

Another example which shows the importance of inclusivity in Kéo is where Kéo is often referred to as “our language” (''sara kita)'' instead of just “Kéo”. (Baird, 2002, pp. 9).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The last alternate form of personal pronouns highlighted by Baird (2002) is ''sira.'' This pronoun may be used instead of 2nd and 3rd person pronouns. The main reason ''sira'' is used would be as an [[honorific]]. It is often used to greet people, and to refer to in-laws or others as a sign of respect. Thus, one would use ''sira'' instead of ''’imu-ko’o'' (Baird, 2002, pp. 114).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kin terms, which is what identifies the relationship between speakers (Baird, 2002, pp. 105),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; are also preferred when addressing in-laws, to establish a close relationship. Thus, ''sira'' would be used more often than more polite pronouns such as ''miu'' (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;113–114).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Regional Varieties''' 
Pronouns help to differentiate dialects. In the past, the difference in the first person singular pronoun ''ja’o'' and ''nga’o'' helped to establish this difference. However, in present times intermarriages between different dialect groups have dissolved these boundaries. Instead, which first person singular pronoun is used is up to personal preference (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;28).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Apart from personal preference, many Kéo speakers have the tendency to follow the form that their mother uses, (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;111)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while some adopt the form that their in-laws use after marriage (Baird, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;112).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Possession ===

==== Adnominal Possession&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ====
* There are two types
** 1) possessive particle is used to link noun phrases. (Eg. ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Aé ko'o kami'' &lt;u&gt;(water-POSS-1st plural exclusive)&lt;/u&gt; (our water))
** 2) possessor can either be oun phrase or pronoun. (Eg. ''Bapa kami'' &lt;u&gt;(father-1st plural exclusive)&lt;/u&gt; (our father))

=== Negation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ===
* Two negators in Kéo. 
** 1) ''mona''
** 2) nggedhé
* These negators are synonmous.
* . Negators can:
** 1) Precede the predicate.
** 2) Be predicates themselves.
** 3) Be interjections.

The [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla Dynasty]] was the ruling [[Thakuri]] dynasty of [[Kathmandu Valley]] in [[Nepal]], from the 12th to the 18th century. At that time only the Kathmandu Valley and surrounding region was known as Nepal or [[Nepal Mandala]] and the citizens were known as ''Nepa:mi'' (in [[Newar language|Newari]]). In the late 15th century, the Kathmandu Valley was divided into three kingdoms of [[Bhaktapur]] (Bhadgaon), [[Kathmandu]] (Kantipur) and [[Patan, Nepal|Patan]] (Lalitpur). The Malla dynasty came to an end in 1769 when [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] of Gorkha invaded the valley, thus inaugurating the [[Kingdom of Nepal|Shah dynasty]] of Nepal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5338">'''Lock On''' is a genre of [[street art]], where artists create [[Street installation|installations]] by attaching sculptures to [[Street furniture|public furniture]] using lengths of [[chain]] and old [[bike lock]]s. 
The installations themselves are referred to as "a Lock On" (''singular'') or "Lock Ons" (''plural'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tejnibyen.dk/Lock_ons.htm|title=Lock On street sculptures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
A Lock On is art in a public space, typically attached to a fence or street lamp with some sort of [[padlock]], without permission. The Lock On style is a "non-destructive" form of [[underground art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandts.dk/en/current-exhibitions?option=com_exhibitions&amp;view=article&amp;id=435 |title=Brandts museum of art, artist description (in English) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130213001613/http://www.brandts.dk/en/current-exhibitions?option=com_exhibitions&amp;view=article&amp;id=435 |archivedate=February 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ring, Katrine|title=Walk This Way|language=danish, english|publisher=Radius (forlag)|pages=29, 50, 54, 64, 66–70|year=2011|isbn=9788792334220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Street artists In [[Portland, Oregon]] have chained toy horses to old metal rings, formerly used for tying real horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horseproject.net/index.htm|title=The Horse Project|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206021952/http://www.horseproject.net/index.htm|archivedate=2013-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
Lock On street sculptures can be made from various materials like wood, plastic, clay, concrete, iron, styrofoam or polystyrene. Typically a part of the concept is to re-use found materials. 
In some cases the materials are released in the same neighborhood where it was originally collected, now upcycled into sculptures, following the thought of improving cityscape by the use of materials that used to impair the very same area.

The locks used when mounting street sculptures are, in some cases, dismounted from broken bikes, found nearby.

== History ==
When founder [[Jacob Cramer]]'s grandfather died following a drawn-out battle with lung cancer in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romona's Kids|url=http://www.cleveland19.com/story/26398692/romonas-kids-love-for-the-elderly|website=Cleveland 19 News|publisher=WOIO|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cramer was profoundly affected, as their relationship had been very strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=14 Year Old Starts Movement to Touch the Lives of the Elderly {{!}} Jacob Cramer {{!}} TEDxYouth@Cincinnati|date=2015-09-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayOmOaXC0Z0|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by his grief to do something to make a difference in his grandfather's honor, Cramer, 13, began handwriting simple letters of kindness to send to seniors in nursing homes, which would eventually become his Letters of Love program, which has collected and distributed over 25,000 handwritten letters to lonely seniors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://parade.com/529572/lharris-2/letters-of-hope-how-one-teen-spreads-smiles-to-the-elderly/|title=Letters of Hope – How One Teen Spreads Smiles to the Elderly|last=Harris|first=Lauren|work=Parade|access-date=2017-03-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.good-deeds-day.org/blog/good-old-fashioned-letters-are-putting-smiles-on-seniors-faces/|title=Good Old Fashioned Letters Are Putting Smiles on Seniors' Faces - Good Deeds Day|date=2016-02-07|newspaper=Good Deeds Day|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past three years, Love for the Elderly has grown internationally, with the sole mission of eponymously providing "love for the elderly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fetzer.org/blog/teen-invites-us-show-love-elderly|title=Teen Invites Us to Show Love for the Elderly|website=fetzer.org|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4463">There are three [[metropolitan planning organization]]s (MPO) in New Jersey. The organizations are the main decision-making forums for selecting projects for the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) in deliberations involving the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] (NJDOT), the [[New Jersey Transit Corporation]] (NJT), county and municipal transportation planners and engineers, other transportation implementing agencies, the public and elected officials at the state, county, and municipal levels.&lt;ref name = NJDOT&gt;{{Cite web   | last =    | first =    | authorlink =    | coauthors =    | title = STIP   | work =    | publisher = New Jersey Department of Transportation   | date = 2007   | url = http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/capital/stip0918/pdf/stip_vol1.pdf   | format =    | doi =    | accessdate = 2011-05-19   | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state’s three MPO are:

*The [[North Jersey Transportation Planning  Authority]] (NJTPA), MPO ID# 34198200, includes [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]], [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]], [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]], [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon]], [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex]],  [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth]], [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris]], [[Ocean County|Ocean]], [[Passaic County|Passaic]], [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset]], [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex]], [[Union County, New Jersey|Union]], and [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren]] counties in the [[Gateway Region]], [[Skylands Region]], and on northern [[Jersey Shore]].
*The [[Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission]] (DVRPC), MPO ID# 42196501, includes [[Burlington County|Burlington]], [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden]], [[Gloucester County, New Jersey|Gloucester]] and [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer]] counties in New Jersey as well [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks]], [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]], [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Monthomery]], and [[Philadelphia]] in [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[Delaware Valley]]
*The South Jersey Transportation Planning Organization (SJTPO),  MPO ID# 34199300, covering [[Atlantic County|Atlantic]], [[Cape May County, New Jersey|Cape May]], [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland]] and [[Salem County|Salem]] counties in [[South Jersey]].

Projects that are identified as potential candidates for inclusion in the regional 
transportation improvement programs of each of the three MPOs are subject to 
intensive screening to verify project scope, status, schedule, and cost.  The resulting “pool”
of projects is analyzed independently by NJDOT, NJ TRANSIT, and the MPOs to assign 
each project a priority based on the extent to which it would advance identified regional and 
statewide objectives, such as objectives set forth in the state and regional long-range 
transportation plans, the New Jersey Capital Investment Strategy, air quality objectives, and 
the broad social and economic goals of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan.&lt;ref name = NJDOT/&gt;
  
NJDOT develops and circulates revenue projections for planning purposes to each of the 
MPOs, based on the best current assessment of available state, federal, and other funds.  
NJDOT, NJ TRANSIT and each of the three MPOs after intensive discussions and forums
negotiate a list of deliverable transportation projects that best fit the composite statewide and 
regional priorities within a financially constrained program.&lt;ref name = NJDOT/&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Mitaka incident'''|三鷹事件|Mitaka jiken}} was an incident that took place in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] on July 15, 1949, when an unmanned [[63 series]] train with its operating handle tied down drove into [[Mitaka Station]] on the [[Chūō Main Line|Chūō Line]], killing six people and injuring 20. The incident remains a mystery, as do the [[Shimoyama incident|Shimoyama]] and [[Matsukawa derailment|Matsukawa incidents]] which occurred around the same time, but it is commonly said to have been a plot by the [[National Railway Workers' Union]]. The government [[indictment|indicted]] ten people on a charge of train sabotage resulting in death of the victims, as well as the train's conductor, Keisuke Takeuchi, who was not in the train when it derailed.

On the day of the derailment, all four of the police officers at Mitaka Station abandoned their posts; this was never explained. Two of the alleged conspirators were indicted for [[perjury]]. Takeuchi's lawyer refused to allow a co-worker to present evidence affirming that he and Takeuchi were in a [[public bath]] together when the train left the station (an apparently airtight proof that at least one other person was involved), claiming it was "irrelevant to the case".

In a court ruling in 1955, the judge found there was no evidence of a conspiracy, but rather that Takeuchi had planned and executed the entire incident himself. Takeuchi was [[death sentence|sentenced to death]]; the other defendants were declared innocent of all charges. All appeals of the verdict were rejected. All the acquitted defendants were members of the [[Japan Communist Party]], but Takeuchi was not. Takeuchi died in jail in 1967 of a brain tumour. Until his death, he continued to proclaim his innocence.

The Shimoyama incident, which came to light on July 5, 1949, the Matsukawa derailment, which occurred on August 17, 1949, and the Mitaka incident together make up the three great mysteries of [[Japanese National Railways]].{{huh|date=March 2014}}

'''Ngoya''', also known as '''Pala''' (Kibala, Ipala), is a newly recognized language of [[Angola]] that since ca. 2010 has been used for national radio broadcasts. It had previously been considered a dialect of [[Kimbundu]] without any linguistic evidence, and appears to be transitional between Kimbundu and [[Umbundu]]. 

Nyoya is spoken in [[Cuanza Sul]] between [[Songo language|Songo]] to the north and Umbundu to the south. 

The name "Ngoya" is an Umbundu word meaning "savage". The endonym is ''Pala'', which with the noun-class-7 prefix is ''Íipàlà''. It is frequently rendered as ''Kibala'', which is the Kimbundu form.&lt;ref name=RELV/&gt;

'''Paramedicalization''' refers to the trend of people setting more and more value on [[alternative medicine]] and different beliefs about wealth and health, which are not authorized by [[medical science]]. The process runs concurrently with [[medicalization]]. 

The concept of paramedicalization was first presented in 1995 by [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Sociology|sociologists]] in the Finnish Journal of social medicine&lt;ref&gt;[[Raimo Tuomainen]] et al.: [http://www.raimotuomainen.fi/paramedikalisaatio.htm Paramedikalisaatio - terveystyötä lääketieteen katveessa.

'''''Pochteca''''' (singular '''''pochtecatl''''') were professional, long-distance traveling [[merchants]] in the [[Aztec]] [[Empire]]. They were a small, but important class as they not only facilitated commerce, but also communicated vital information across the empire and beyond its borders. The trade or commerce was referred to as '''''pochtecayotl'''''. The ''pochteca'' also traveled outside the empire to trade with neighboring lands throughout [[Mesoamerica]].  Because of their extensive travel and knowledge of the [[empire]], ''pochteca'' were often employed as [[Espionage|spies]].  The subject of Book 9 of the ''[[Florentine Codex]]'' (1576), compiled by [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], is the ''pochteca''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur J. O. Anderson]] and [[Charles Dibble]], eds. and translators, ''The Florentine Codex'' Book 9, Salt Lake City, University of Utah Press.&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Status in Aztec society==
[[File:Pochtecas con su carga.JPG|230px|thumb|Pochteca according to the [[Florentine Codex]]]]
''Pochteca'' occupied a high status in [[Aztec society]], below the noble class. The pochteca were responsible for providing the materials that the noble class used to display their wealth. These materials were often obtained from foreign sources. The ''pochteca'' also acted as agents for the nobility by selling the surplus tribute that had been bestowed on the noble and warrior elite and also sourcing rare goods or luxury items. The ''pochteca'' traded the excess tribute (food, garments, feathers and slaves) in the marketplace or carried it to other areas to exchange for trade goods.&lt;ref&gt;Haemig, P.D., "Aztec Emperor Auitzol and the Great-Tailed Grackle," ''Biotropica,'' Vol. 10-11, 1978, pp 11-17 &lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the success of the ''pochteca'', many of these merchants became as wealthy as the noble class, but were obligated to hide this wealth from the public. Trading expeditions often left their districts late in the evening, and their wealth was only revealed within their private guildhalls. Although politically and economically powerful, the ''pochteca'' strove to avoid undue attention. The merchants followed their own laws in their own ''[[calpulli]]'', venerating their god, [[Yacatecuhtli]], "The Lord Who Guides", an aspect of [[Quetzalcoatl]]. Eventually the merchants were elevated to the rank of the warriors of the military orders. &lt;ref&gt;Salomón, F., "Pochteca and mindalá: a comparison of long-distance traders in Ecuador and Mesoamerica," ''Journal of the Steward Anthropological Society, '' Vol. 1-2, 1978, pp 231-246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The ''pochteca'' were organized into powerful guilds,&lt;ref&gt;Oka, R. and Kusimba, C.M., "The Archaeology of Trading Systems, Part 1: Towards a New Trade Synthesis," The Archaeology of Trading Systems, Part 1: Towards a New Trade Synthesis," ''Journal of Archaeological Research,'' Vol. 16, pp 351&lt;/ref&gt; each based in one of the urban centers of the Valley of México:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
* [[Tenochtitlán]]
* [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]]
* [[Huitzilopochco]]
* [[Cuautitlán]]
* [[Azcapotzalco]]
* [[Mixcoac]]
* [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]
* [[Huexotla]]
* [[Coatlichan]]
* [[Otompan]]
* [[Xochimilco]]
* [[Chalco (altepetl)|Chalco]]
{{div col end|3}}
The markets were part of a complex interlocking system. In the Valley there were four levels of market:
* The great market of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]] which met daily.
* The markets of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] and Xochimilco.
* The ''Macuiltianquiztli'' - every five-days markets of the city-states Huitzilopocho, Cuautitlán, Azcapotzalco, Mixcoac, Huexotla, Cóatlichan, Otompan and Chalco.
* The markets of the smaller towns and villages.

Some of the cities were famous for specialized markets:
* Texcoco sold ceramics and clothing.
* Acolman specialized in dogs and food animals.
* Tepepulco sold birds, important for their feathers.
* Azcapotzalco was a trading hub and controlled all major markets and trade routes.

The highest official of the ''pochteca'' in [[Tenochtitlán]] was the ''Pochtecatlailotlac'', the Merchant-Arbiter who also sat as one of the judges in the ''Tlacxitlan'', the highest court of law. 

Each of these cities included a merchant district and a market, the ''tianquiztli'', though the greatest market was the tianquizco in [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]], the fifth ''campan'' of [[Tenochtitlán]]. [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]] included  seven calpulli inhabited by the pochteca: ''Pochtlan, Ahhuachtlan, Atlauhco, Acxotlan, Tepetitlan, Itztolco'' and ''Tzommolco''. Each of the ''pochteca calpulli'' were governed by the ''Pochtecatlatoque'' – the Merchant Speakers or Leaders. Those of the ''Pochtlan'' and ''Acxotlan'' districts had special titles:
* The ''Tlailotlac'' of ''Pochtlan'' was the arbiter in mercantile affairs, overseeing the commerce of the ''Pochteca Teucnehnenqueh'', the ‘travelling lords’. Elderly experienced merchants, the ''Pochtecahuehuetqueh'', helped him manage the mercantile concerns of the district.
* The ''[[Acxoteca]]'' of ''Acxotlan'' was the Merchant-General of the ''[[Naualoztomeca]]'', the ‘disguised merchants’.

Each of the ''[[Pochtecatlatoque]]'' were aided by the ''pochtecatlatoque''. The pochtecatlatoque were the elder of the pochteca, and were no longer travelers, but rather acted as [[administrator (business)|administrators]], overseeing young pochteca and administering the [[marketplace]]. 

The volume of trade passing through the great ''tianquizco'' of ''[[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]]'' was unsurpassed in [[Mesoamerica]]. Some sources have estimated that up to 60,000 people daily passed through this market hub. The Spanish conquerors commented on the impressive nature of the local markets in the 15th century. The [[Mexica]] ([[Aztec]]) market of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]] was the largest in all the [[Americas]] and said to be superior to those in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rebecca M. Seaman|title=Conflict in the Early Americas: An Encyclopedia of the Spanish Empire's Aztec, Incan and Mayan Conquests|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXKjAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA375|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; It served not merely to distribute goods but as the great clearing house of the Empire. Such was the organisation required to manage this massive entrepreneurial center that the [[Aztec]] state founded special institutions and officials to oversee it.
* The ''Pochtecatlailotlac'', the ‘first of the merchants’ was the effective governor of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]], answering to the ''[[Huey Tlatoani]]'' and accounted a magistrate of the'' Teuctlahtohqueh'', the imperial judges.
* The ''Tianquizpan Tlayacanqui'', the Marketplace Judges, oversaw the enactment of ''pochteca'' laws and sentenced any thieves caught within the confines of the ''[[tianquizco]].'' The ''Pochteca Tlahtocan'' commercial court had three levels and between three and five judges would sit in court each market day.
* The omnipresent ''[[Tianquiztlacanqui]]'' administered the day-to-day running of the market, checking for compliance with the laws and looking out for fraudulent dealing. They also ensured the payment of the [[Empire|imperial]] trade tax, the ''pochtecatequitl'', enforced on all sales.

==Types of ''pochteca''==

The professional merchants were classified into the following roles:
* The importers: ''pochteca'' and ''oztomeca''.
* The wholesalers, the ''tlaquixtiani''.
* The retailers, the ''tlanecuilo''.

The ''pochteca'' were divided into the following types:
* The ''Pochteca Teucnehnenqueh'', the ''pochteca'' trading on behalf of the nobility. They were considered the higher rank of ''pochteca'', carrying out some private trade as well. 
* The'' Pochteca'' ''Naualoztomeca'', the ‘disguised merchants’, seeking after rare goods often on their own behalf but also as spies for the state. A ''oztomecatl'' (plural ''oztomeca'') was a merchant-guard or vanguard-merchant seeking out new markets and resources and goods of interest to [[Tenochtitlán]]. Senior warrior-merchants were known as ''Teyahualonime'', with a merchant-general given the title of ''Acxotecatl''. Often the trade performed by these warrior-merchants was a precursor of military conquest.

Within these groups there were also:
* The ''Tecouanime'', the slave merchants. These people were often referred to as the richest of merchants, as they played a central role in bathing the slaves used for sacrificial victims.
* The'' Iyahqueh'', merchants based in outlying trade stations and depots, supporting the long trade routes.
* The ''Tlanamacani'', salesmen acting as agents for the ''pochteca'' [[guilds]] tribe.

==Lesser traders==
The ''Tlanecuilo'' or ''Tlanecuiloani'', the regional traders and pedlars were not part of the ''pochteca'' guilds but were an important part of market commerce. They traded in foodstuffs and utilitarian goods rather than the luxuries carried by the ''pochteca'' and frequently specialised in specific items, such as:
* The ''Huauhnamacac'' traders who sold the seeds of [[amaranth]] (pigweed). In several ceremonies images of the gods (notably [[Huitzilopochtli]]) were made with [[amaranth]] mixed with honey to be eaten by the people.
* The ''Iztanamacaque'', sellers of salt.
* The ''Tlacemanqui'' traders who sold items, including silver and gold.
* The ''Tlanamacac'' producer-sellers who came to the markets to sell their fresh produce.

[[File:Psuko shel yom.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Opening caption of "''Psuko Shel Yom''" ('''פסוקו של יום''')]] 
'''Psuko shel Yom''' ({{lang-he|'''פסוקו של יום'''}}, ''Psuqo shel yom'', lit. "[The] Verse Of The Day") was an [[Israel]]i daily midnight minutes-long program-segment aired on the public [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel 1]], reciting selected daily [[Tanakh|biblical]], [[Midrash]] or [[Aggadah]] verses. 

''Psuko shel Yom'' was aired on a daily basis just as the Israeli [[Public broadcasting|public channel]] retired for the night and closed its broadcast. The channel was for many years the only one in Israel, and therefore the program aired just in time before people fell asleep, and it became an Israeli culture-cult segment.

''Psuko shel Yom'' is aired at midnight and has been broadcasting the same platform-content for over thirty years. The TV screen displays the verses with biblical fonts while the reciter (not shown), [[Mordechai Freidman]], reads the selected passage, and while the "[[Yad]]" (Torah Pointer) moves through with the verses of the page, at pace with the reciter. A short musical segment, in "biblical" style music, is always played at the beginning and the end of the program. It also became a cultural-cult sound track associated with ''Psuko shel Yom''. At the conclusion of the program, in later stages, it was followed by a channel slide featuring Jerusalem at night and IBA announcer Malachi Ezekiah saying "The broadcast of Israeli Television has finished for today. Good night from Jerusalem." and was followed by the [[Hatikvah|national anthem]].   

The program has been broadcast every night since November 1969, when the television service's hours of broadcasting grew. It was first initiated by Benyamin Zvieli, who was then the manager of the Jewish heritage department in the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]. He was the reciter, and the secretary of the department, Leah, was responsible for moving the "[[Yad]]". After his retirement, he was replaced by Mordechai Freidman as the reciter, who is still the daily reciter as of 2010. 

During the 1980s and 1990s, [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] shows were created based on ''Psuko shel Yom'': ''Psuko shel Makom'' (a place's passage), and ''Agada Shel Makom'' (a place's [[Aggadah]] [lit. legend]), which showed sites in Israel and the related verses and legends.

In 2016, a new series was commissioned as part of a campaign initiated by Channel 1 to reinstate old programming for two months. This new series consisted of thirty episodes and were about the history of broadcasting in Israel.

==''Psuko Shel Yom'' Folklore==
''Psuko Shel Yom'' became part of the Israeli Folklore and is mentioned in Israeli media outlets, in many broad related issues, ranging from serious news matters to comedy style issues.   

In many people's views, the regular broadcasting of the midnight segment individualizes the broadcasting of the Hebrew public channel 1, and provides a unique Jewish spiciness. It reminds people of the term "[[Daf Yomi]]" ("[the] daily page", a daily regimen undertaken to study the Babylonian [[Talmud]]), and grants a drop of [[Judaism]] to the broad Israeli public, especially the secular one, becoming part of the Jewish heritage. 

The midnight short segment has also taken a hit from critics. The broadcasting in a midnight hour is claimed by the critics to be somewhat associated with weariness and sleeping. Also, the regular displayed platform-content that is unchanged, was criticized to be repeatedly old fashioned, and the old-fashioned biblical text with non common Modern Hebrew words - all became a platform for self-humor on daily basis and on comedy writings.

'''Race in Ghana''' is marked by an underlying racial hierarchy valuing whiteness over blackness. This may be seen through certain social phenomena from within Ghana and other [[postcolonial]] regions in the world. The process of racialization has been reinforced by the postcolonial policies and ongoing Western influence, both culturally and economically.

== Racial politics of Ghana ==

The racial political structure of [[Ghana]] is based on the conception that Ghana as a country is free of racism due to their status as being the first [[Africa]]n [[colony]] to gain full independence on March 6, 1957.&lt;ref name=Mount&gt;{{cite paper|last1=Mount|first1=Graema S.|title=Ghana's Relations with the Great Powers, 1964-1966: Ghana and the Cold War|journal=Global Studies Journal|year=2013|volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=2–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the country is seen as the central hub for [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[African nationalism]] on the continent. Due to this reputation, Ghana is revered as the pioneer that championed over the European Colonization of Africa ([[Scramble for Africa]]) and til this day, Ghana still serves as a role model of independence in Africa. As the nation progressed, the racial lines that once marginalized groups within Ghana began to break down and a new identity of blackness had emerged in response to years of European domination. Since then many [[Ghanaian]] and Africans alike have shown great unity during times of Ghana's celebration of its independence.

Yet despite these tremendous initiatives, certain critics and researchers alike have made arguments to suggest that despite the liberation of Ghana, the presence of European [[hegemony]] still exist in their everyday lives. As suggested by Jemima Pierre, the racial connotations of Ghana implicate that there are societal norms and economic practices that perpetuate [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pierre|first1=Jemima|title=The Predicament of Blackness: Postcolonial Ghana and the Politics of Race|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year= 2013|isbn=9780226923031|pages=67–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her argument, it is suggested that the cultural implication of whiteness has caused many Ghanaians to become more inherently invested in promoting positive traits and institutions that are seen as more modern and sophisticated. This perspective has brought a great deal of controversy and debate among academics in the African studies community. Due to this debate, many Ghanaians and critics have come forward with the counter argument that Ghana as a whole is a hallmark of black pride, but Pierre's argument countered these claims given the evidence of how European hegemony has and is still influencing many of the social aspects in the state of Ghana.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The perspective which Pierre argued stems from the colonial past that Ghana endured during its history. As a European colony, Ghana was subjected to numerous levels of changes that resulted into the societal change. After its independence, Ghana was able to take control of its development and political economy. The first Ghanaian President, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], developed policies and national symbols to reinforce the new found African pride that had swept the African continent. But there were many challenges that proved to be dangerous and detrimental to the Ghanaian state. These obstacles were the continued European influence, political instability, and the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name=Mount /&gt; These problems greatly contributed to the struggle of racial identity in Ghana given the constant interference by the Europeans and other Western powers. Another attribute that contributes to racial identity in Ghana are the number of immigrants of non-African descent that migrated to Ghana during the [['60s]] to the mid-[['90s]]. The migrations occurred due to the new hopes of economic investment, and because of the influx of immigrants, Ghana's demographic make-up has shifted during the last sixty years. As a result, Ghana's racial identity is becoming more globalized with the exception that the majority of Ghanaians are of African origin. Given the overall population with black Ghanaians being the majority, there is still considerably outside influences that dictate how the Ghanaian government operates on the bases of accommodating outside investors, foreign government officials, and business men/women (particularly White/Europeans) for their services and visits which are sometimes accompanied with special treatment and benefits.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

=== The ghost of Anglo European hegemony ===

In order to clearly understand the concept of the Ghost of Anglo European Hegemony, it needs to be broken down. Hegemony is the normalized dominance of one group over another. When Jemima Pierre references this she is stating how the Anglo Europeans left lasting impressions on the Ghanaian people and land. The ghost is the lingering effects of what was done when the Europeans were inhabitants of Ghana along with the Ghanaian people. Some of these effects include division of the people by way of economic power/position and the disruption to local politics pre-European influence. Once the Europeans pulled out of the land they had already destroyed the civility that once existed. The leaders from indirect rule were left in place. These leaders were there to continue to implement the policies and laws that Europeans had enacted. These laws, unbeknownst to them at the time, were racist and were created to keep the division wide.

==The trope of whiteness in Ghana==

In Ghana, the ghosts of colonialism, white supremacy, and imperialism still linger in their society, whiteness is seen as superior and the goal, creating a Trope of Whiteness. There's an initial distrust of white people, but also a need to become white and assimilate into white culture. In the book, ''The Predicament of Blackness: Postcolonial Ghana and the Politics of Race'', Jemima Pierre speaks to a group of Ghanaian college students about how they view white people and white influence. Many of the college students had an almost God-like view of white people, calling them "demigods" or "mini-gods",&lt;ref name="The Chicago Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pierre|first1=|title=The Predicament of Blackness|publisher=|date=2013|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; the University students also pointed out that they treat white people better than their fellow Ghanaians despite an initial distrust for white people, and this is because the students see white people as more successful, more advanced, more educated, and are leading in almost all industries. . This Trope of Whiteness is one of the many lasting impacts of colonialism in Ghana, and because of white supremacy and internalized racism it is almost ingrained in the minds of many Ghanaians that white people are better and/or smarter. The idea that "whiteness is the ownership of the Earth" ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pierre|first1=|title=The Predicament of Blackness|publisher=|date=2013|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; goes hand in hand with the Trope of Whiteness in Ghana, Ghanaians are exposed to Eurocentric beauty standards and even the white washing of religion is ingrained in the minds of many Ghanaians.

Kwame Dompi, a professor at a university in the United States, made an assertion about the whitewashed view of Jesus in Ghana. "If you think of God as the good of all good, then you will think of Whites the same way.".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pierre|title=The Predicament of Blackness|publisher=|date=2013|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many Ghanaian churches, Jesus has "long blond hair and a blond beard"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and the significance of having a white Jesus goes back to the dialogue about white people being "mini-gods" or "demigods".&lt;ref name="The Chicago Press"/&gt; It can also lead to many Ghanaians' belief in an exaggerated white goodness, that because Jesus is white then all whites must be good because Jesus is good, and it pushes along the message that darkness and blackness is bad, therefore they are bad, and this can often lead to many Ghanaians performing whiteness to seem and be more successful, attractive, and good. This is especially true for poor Ghanaians, who do see whiteness as wealth and power. In her book, Pierre tells the story of a young Ghanaian girl who shyly waves at a white family, just hoping to catch their attention, and it is pointed out to Pierre that if the family was non-White they would not get the same reception from her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pierre|first1=|title=The Predicament of Blackness|publisher=|date=2013|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trope of Whiteness in Ghana is confusing and often times problematic, because of where the trope comes from. The admiration of whiteness did not happen overnight, but because of centuries of colonialism, imperialism, and white/European influence on pop culture and religion have become so ingrained in the minds of Ghanaians that they, and many other African decedents have a hard time letting go of it, or want to become a part of it

=== The Obruni case ===

The word ''obruni'' means "foreigner". Its modern use shows how omnipresent the racial hierarchy is in Ghanaian culture.

Originally used to identify White Europeans, the term is now used to refer to foreign Whites as well as foreign Asians, diaspora Blacks and Ghanaians returning from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Predicament of Blackness|last=Pierre|first=|publisher= |year=2013|isbn=|location=|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's common use to describe seemingly rich and culturally different Ghanaians and other Blacks signals a clear association made between Whiteness as racialized identity and Whiteness as a particular class status, cultural standing, education level and outlook. By unconsciously reinforcing the link between whiteness and wealth, it normalizes social characteristics held by the white people.

In the same way, obruni is also sometimes used as an indicator for goodness or attractiveness. This use of the word links directly whiteness to goodness. Thus, It construct and affirms a racial hierarchy dominated by the white people that permeates society. It contributes indirectly to the legitimation of the latter's social domination in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=White: Essays on Race and Culture|last=Dyer|first=Richard|publisher=London: Routledge|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skin bleaching ==
[[Skin lightening in Ghana]] or [[skin whitening]] has become increasingly popular, with many citizens of Ghana having a desire for lighter skin colour. The products that they use that can cause permanent damage to their skin as well as to their health. This is all because of the internalized racism that the Ghanaian citizens have encountered.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Predicament of Blackness|last=Pierre|first=|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skin bleaching crosses class lines, which makes it a problem that affects the entire country. In 2005 the [[Ghana Health Service]] launched an anti-bleaching campaign to inform its citizens of the potential damage that skin bleaching causes.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; The region that has the most problem with skin bleaching is the Ashanti region.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; This is due to cultural adaptation to skin bleaching. The queen mother is favoured when she is lighter, this is because she holds a place a power and she needs to look brighter. The problem with skin bleaching is due to the internalized racism in Ghana where whiteness is favoured.

== Race and the politics of African-Diaspora interactions ==
Race, when it comes to the interaction with the African-Diaspora, is “within mutual processes of discourse, practices, and (mis)recognitions that are informed both by African diasporic racial consciousness and identity and by Ghanaian racialized consciousness and agency.”&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; There are some differences in views on the aspect of slavery and its role in history between the people of the Diaspora and Ghanaian people. The Ghanaian people believe that the [[Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade]] did not affect them as much as it effected the people of the Diaspora. This does not mean that they view slavery as a less significant part of African history, to them it is a part that did not affect them as much. Descendants of the Diaspora feel the complete opposite. During a conversation with Lynette, Kofi, stated that Lynette was the lucky one. "I was surprised- shocked, even- that one of my friends would have such a view of the African diasporic experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Predicament of Blackness|last=Pierre|first=|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; To people of the diaspora the Trans-Atlantic slave trade is seen as barbaric, inhumane and heinous. Despite the difference of perspective regarding the slave trade, Ghanaians believe in solidarity with all people of African descent. As a result of their solidarity the first president of Ghana created the All-African People's Revolutionary Party.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The [[All-African People's Revolutionary Party]] (A-APRP) was established to combat the forces oppressing Africans worldwide in a struggle for equality while uniting them through a revolutionary [[Pan-Africanism]] movement. A-APRP was requested by the first president of Ghana Kwame Nkrumah. Kwame Toure was a U.S. civil rights and Black Power movement activist formerly known as [[Stokely Carmichael]]. With Toure as leader the party grew so fast that it spread throughout the African Continent and the [[African diaspora|African Diaspora]]. In Ghana, the party focused on African unity as define by Pan-Africanism, while maintaining a balance between work and study. This also stressed that members raise their political consciousness

Descendants of the diaspora are often viewed as tourists travelling for pleasure. However, when these people do journey to Africa, specifically Ghana, more often than not it is with the intent of discovering their history first hand. "Black diaspora visitors journey to Africa for cultural and spiritual renewal...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Predicament of Blackness|last=Pierre|first=|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This voyage is an attempt to fill a void that was caused by the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and the displacement of those people and their ancestors. They feel connected to the land and the people. The voyages also serve to gain first hand knowledge and experience between the descendants of the Diaspora and Ghanaian people. The voyages are beneficial to both groups. Some Ghanaian people feel connected to the descendants of the diaspora as well, this is seen in the greetings among other things. They often refer to each other as brother, sister, or cousin to show the mutual feeling of connection.

=== The influence of heritage tourism ===
Heritage tourism is a form of political socioeconomic gain and a huge part of [[Tourism in Ghana]]. It is described as when a person travels to experience a place that includes cultural, historic and natural resources with its artifacts and activities that authentically represent the stories and people of the past and present. The process of racialization via heritage tourism are perpetuated at a local and state level via the state institutions and organizations that operate the PANAFEST/ Emancipation Day. The influences of heritage tourism on the process of racialization are strictly economic. The Ghanaian governments exploit the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and its history as a basis for economic prosperity. Ghanaians Freddie Blay, the minister of tourism, focused on developmental and emancipation goals for Africa but emphasized that these goals would only be conceptual under the fold of Africa’s contemporary economic situation and Ghana’s history of slavery. Blay stated: “Emancipation day should be a universal event because Africa endured a trauma unprecedented in the annals of history …we carry the marks and scars of slavery and its later [result] of discrimination ...slavery affected economic growth and social growth ...we salute the survival of the African - both on the continent and in the diaspora… What we need is the unity of resolve and a purpose. Therefore, challenge this generation of Africans, whether on the homeland or in the diaspora, to rise up to the challenge and prove the resilience of the African spirit and the resourcefulness of the African mind” (Pierre, 125) It is explained that the emancipation and African spirit both symbolized the self determination and future economic development. The state depicts heritage tourism through the global perspective of slavery in benefit of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coloradopreservation.org/faqs/what-is-heritage-tourism/|title=What is Heritage Tourism?|website=coloradopreservation.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sihanaka''' are a [[ethnic groups of Madagascar|Malagasy ethnic group]] concentrated around [[Lake Alaotra]] and the town of [[Ambatondrazaka]] in central northeastern [[Madagascar]].  Their name means the "people of the swamps" in reference to the marshlands around Lake Alaotra that they inhabit. While rice has long been the principal crop of the region, by the 17th century, the Sihanaka had also become wealthy traders in slaves and other goods, capitalizing on their position on the main trade route between the capital of the neighboring [[Kingdom of Imerina]] at [[Antananarivo]] and the eastern port of [[Toamasina]]. At the turn of the 19th century they came under the control of the [[Boina Kingdom]] before submitting to Imerina, which went on to rule over the majority of Madagascar. Today the Sihanaka practice intensive agriculture and rice yields are higher in this region than elsewhere, placing strain on the many unique plant and animal species that depend on the Lake Alaotra ecosystem for survival.

The Sihanaka have a generally egalitarian social structure, with the eldest male at the head of the family. Traditional beliefs predominate, although [[Christianity in Madagascar|Christianity]] has also had an influence. Social life here, as elsewhere in Madagascar, is guided by the principles of respect for the ancestors and the ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'' (taboos) established by them. Traditional social practices include complex funeral and divorce rites and a strong and continuing prohibition on working in paddy fields on Tuesdays.

==Ethnic identity==
The Sihanaka are concentrated around the historically swampy land surrounding [[Lake Alaotra]] and the town of [[Ambatondrazaka]] in central northeastern [[Madagascar]].  Their name means the "people of the swamps", partly in reference to the marshlands around Lake Alaotra that they inhabit.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|page=27}} More specifically, the word for swamp is a compound composed of ''sia'' (to wander or lose one's way) and ''hanaka'' (spilling or scattering), and some ethnologists have proposed that the name evokes the earliest period in Sihanaka identity when the group's ancestors were migrating in search of the better home they eventually found at Alaotra.{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=113}}

==History==
[[File:Ethnic groups of Madagascar Map.png|thumb|left|200px|Distribution of Malagasy ethnic groups]]
Oral history offers several stories regarding the origins of the Sihanaka. [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]] traders may have been the first to reach the area traveling inland on the [[Maningory River]]. Another view posits that the presence of ancient earthen defensive trenches suggests the ancestors of the [[Merina people|Merina]] may have passed by Lake Alaotra on their migration from the southeastern coast to the central highlands, leaving behind settlers whose descendants formed the first Sihanaka communities.{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=108}} Alternatively, a large group calling itself Sihanaka may have migrated from Imerina into the Alaotra area, which may have already been settled by individuals of various other [[Malagasy people|ethnic groups]], in order to maintain independence from the rule of the Merina king.{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=114}}

At least as far back as the mid-1600s, the Sihanaka were established as a technologically sophisticated and prosperous people who provided slaves to slave traders supplying the plantations of the [[Mascarene Islands]].{{sfn|Ogot|1992|page=431}} To protect themselves and their wealth, Sihanaka villages were often fortified by earthen walls (''tamboho'') of the type also prevalent in the neighboring [[Kingdom of Imerina]]. Around 1700, the Sihanaka were a major trading partner of the Betsimisaraka, to whom they traded rice and [[zebu]]. The Betsimisaraka, desirous of greater access to Sihanaka wealth, successfully negotiated for French assistance to bring the Sihanaka under their control. French militiamen launched several attacks against Sihanaka communities. This incursion was foiled through a combination of firepower - the Sihanaka having obtained numerous firearms through trade with the [[Sakalava people|Sakalava]] to the west - and the prevalence of malaria and other tropical diseases that decimated the French soldiers.{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=109}}

In the 18th century, the Sihanaka were vassals of the [[Boina Kingdom]]. They mounted at least one major attack against the Boina in an attempt to regain independence, but were unsuccessful. The high number of slaves possessed by the Sihanaka led to a spate of slave revolts in 1768 that they requested European assistance to quell.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|page=431}} Around 1800 the territory was conquered by the armies of the Kingdom of Imerina under the leadership of King [[Andrianampoinimerina]]. This led to a massive inflow of [[Merina people|Merina]] colonists who settled among the Sihanaka and introduced a variety of cultural, economic and political practices that were assimilated into the local culture to the extent that by the mid-19th century "it resembled a Merina province".{{sfn|Ellis|Rajaonah|1998|page=70}} The Sihanaka resented this imposition and held the Merina sovereigns in low regard.{{sfn|Ellis|Rajaonah|1998|page=89}}

The 1895 capture of the Merina royal capitol, the [[Rova of Antananarivo]], by the French sparked the [[Menalamba rebellion]] against foreigners, [[Christianity in Madagascar|Christianity]] and Merina domination. In the chaotic 1895–97 period, bands of [[Sakalava]], Marofotsy and other bandits engaged in raids to loot cattle and other goods. The Sihanaka were especially hard hit owing to their reputation as a relatively wealthy trading people. Many Sihanaka villagers resorted to sleeping in the forests and fields to avoid falling victim to nighttime pillage and arson; entire Sihanaka villages were burned.{{sfn|Ellis|Rajaonah|1998|page=108}}

Following [[French Madagascar|French colonization]] of the island in 1897, the colonial administration imposed a heavy burden of ''[[corvée]]'' (statute labor) on the Sihanaka in the 1910s, requisitioning them for minimal to no pay to build the railroad linking the coastal port of [[Toamasina]] to the capital city.{{sfn|Fremigacci|2014|pages=190-199}}

Today, the Sihanaka heavily cultivate the land around Laka Alaotra and have increasingly drained the swamps to make way for farming using heavy machinery.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|page=27}}  This loss of habitat has posed a threat to species living in the area, including the critically endangered [[Lac Alaotra bamboo lemur]], the only lemur species on the island to have evolved to live in and eat the [[papyrus]] reeds bordering the lake.&lt;ref name="Mutschler1999"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Mutschler | first1 = T. | chapter = Folivory in a Small-Bodied Lemur | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4615-4705-1_13 | title = New Directions in Lemur Studies | editor1 = Berthe Rakotosamimanana| editor2 = Hanta Rasamimanana| editor3 = Jörg U.

==Family and society==
In 2013, the Sihanaka were estimated to number around 200,000.{{sfn|Diagram Group|2013}} Families are hierarchical, with parents exercising authoritarian control over their children.{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=103}}  Sihanaka men and women have significant autonomy in deciding when to marry and whether to divorce.  Marriages are disallowed between siblings, cousins, and direct ascendents.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=163}} To reinforce this forbidden physical intimacy, Sihanaka have historically used a formal term of address when speaking to these particular family members.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=165}} Mothers are traditionally subject to several fady, such as not being allowed to look at dead infants, eat veal, or eat a particular type of banana once their child had learned to say the word for it.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=169}} Parents were traditionally responsible for educating their own children, and while today those who can afford a formal education will study at school, parents and the broader community remain collectively engaged in educating children into social and cultural norms and practices.{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=114}} Male children are circumcised by their families no later than the age of seven.{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=115}}

Among the Sihanaka, communities are led by their eldest members, termed ''Tangalamena'' or ''Zokiolona''.{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=103}}  Social relations are guided by the principle of ''[[fihavanana]]'' (solidarity, goodwill).{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=114}} Although the Sihanaka never developed a centralized kingdom like their western neighbor, the Kingdom of Imerina,{{sfn|Ogot|1992|page=431}} the Sihanaka were historically united around their traditional religious beliefs.{{sfn|Ellis|Rajaonah|1998|page=70}}

&lt;!--===Class affiliation===--&gt;

===Religious affiliation===
The traditional beliefs of the Sihanaka, as elsewhere in Madagascar, revolve around respect for a creator god (''Zanahary''), the ancestors, and ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'' (ancestral interdictions). Aspects of ancestor worship among the Sihanaka include ''joro'' (collective prayers said to invoke the blessings of God or the ancestors), burial in family tombs, the ''[[famadihana]]'' reburial ceremony, and the sanctification of particular stones (''tsangambato''), land (''tany masina''), and shrines (''doany'', ''tony'' and ''jiro'').{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=115}} Another major element of this tradition is the role of ''ambalavelona'', believed to be the spirits of the ancestors themselves. Each ancestral practice or tradition has a particular spirit associated with it, and the Sihanaka show respect for these spirits by maintaining ancestral customs and traditions and adhering to ''fady''.{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=115}}

The Sihanaka share the belief common throughout the island that the spirits of ancestors can possess the living, placing them in a trance state called a ''tromba''. The Sihanaka traditionally believe that looking at a [[cuckoo roller]] (an indigenous bird) will induce the tromba.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=265}} Communities look to ''ombiasy'' (wise men) for spiritual guidance, to commune with the ancestors, and to determine which days are auspicious for undertaking particular tasks or endeavors.{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=114}} By the 1600s, a uniform religious belief system had grown around a group of ''[[sampy]]'' (idols) believed to channel the protective spiritual power of 11 deities. The origin of these amulets is said to have been in the western territories under [[Sakalava]] control.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|page=431}}

The Christian conversion of the Merina royal court in 1869 spurred the arrival of Merina missionaries in Sihanaka country and the conversion of a significant portion of the population. Following the French capture of the Merina capital in 1895, Christianity was largely abandoned in Sihanaka and traditional religious beliefs regained preeminence; at least one major historic church in the area was burned.{{sfn|Ellis|Rajaonah|1998|page=108}} French Catholic missionaries arrived in the area around 1900 and gradually began converting members of local communities.{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=141}} This was soon followed by a renewed effort on the part of Protestant missionaries, leading to further conversions. Today, traditional beliefs remain strong among the Sihanaka, although a growing number practice orthodox Christianity or a syncretic form that incorporates aspects of traditional respect for ancestors and their norms.{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=114}}

==Culture==
European visitors in 1667 reported the Sihanaka lived in fortified villages, which they very effectively defended with bows and arrows. They were the only ethnic group encountered by the European party that had built a bridge.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|page=431}} Homes were made of plant material; the Sihanaka believed building homes in brick or clay would invite the displeasure of the ancestors.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=39}} Gendered roles factored into house construction and maintenance: men applied carpentry to build the frame of the house and roof, as well as the windows and doors and their frames, while women wove ''zozoro'' reed mats that would serve as walls, flooring and roofing.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=299}}

The principal food eaten in Sihanaka has long been rice, which they cultivate heavily. The rice based diet was supplemented by a wide range of game and other meats, including lemurs, wild boars, snakes, owls, rats, cats and crocodile, the latter having at one time been protected by a fady that was eventually abandoned.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=209}} Use of tobacco or marijuana{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=299}} and consumption of pork{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=225}} were commonly forbidden in Sihanaka families.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=299}} Many believed that transporting swine across Lake Alaotra would bring storms.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=196}} Their traditional dress consisted of clothing woven of raffia fibers.{{sfn|Condra|2013|page=455}}

The traditional martial art of ''[[moraingy]]'', particularly common among Sakalava communities, was historically common among the Sihanaka.{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=137}}

===''Fady''===
Sihanaka culture traditionally adhered to a wide variety of ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'', some of which are still respected to varying degrees by more traditional families to the present day. Many of their fady in the early 1900s were documented by historian Van Gennep. The most absolute fady and the only one that was seemingly practiced by all Sihanaka was a prohibition against working in a paddy field on Tuesdays; sub-groups among the Sihanaka also practiced other taboos associated with particular days of the week, such as not leaving the house or not cleaning floor mats on certain days.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=203}} A fady was placed on consumption of any new or foreign products, including Western medicines.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=37}} Another common fady was a taboo against watching the rising or setting of the sun, staring at anything red, or falling asleep at sunset.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=55}}

Fady have served to protect certain wildlife in the Sihanaka homeland.  The [[aye-aye]] is the subject of numerous fady and folk tales among the Sihanaka. It was traditionally believed that a person who fell asleep in the forest might be brought a pillow by an aye-aye. If the pillow was for one's head, he or she would become rich, but if it was for the feet, that person would be subject to evil sorcery.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=223}} Similarly, the [[indri]] is considered sacred and may not be hunted, killed or eaten.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=199}}

===Funeral rites===
The Sihanaka traditionally believed that death was always associated with a contagion that could be passed to family members of the deceased.  This belief is reflected in traditional funeral rites.  A second door to the family home was used uniquely for carrying out the body of the deceased.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=64}}  Before the body was removed, the widow of the deceased would dress in a fine red ''[[lamba (garment)|lamba]]'' and put on all her jewelery, then watch the procession from her seat at the main entryway to her house.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=61}} The villagers carried the body to a house where the village women would gather, and the female family members would weep while the other women would play drums and recite prayers. The men would stay in a separate house (called the ''tranolahy'', or "men's house") where they would prepare a feast of cooked meat and rum, which they would periodically deliver to the women mourners. Occasionally a selected man would circle the house and sing a funeral chant, with the women inside interjecting in call-and-response.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=158}}  After the feast, a community leader would dip his finger in melted fat and touch those who had assisted in the funeral, to protect them against illness and from being followed by malevolent spirits.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=74}}

Family members of the deceased would then reunite in the family home where they would drink more rum and carry out a ritual of purification (''faly ranom-bohangy'').  Lemon or lime leaves and two other herbs were soaked in a bowl of water, and a family member whose parents were still living would be chosen to sprinkle it on the deceased's possessions, enabling them to be redistributed and reused.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=74}} The door by which the corpse had been removed was then locked for eight days, during which time the family was required to fast. After completion of this fasting period, the family underwent a purification ritual (''afana'') and the second door was unlocked.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=64}} Another feast was observed to formally end the period of community purification.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=75}} The home of the deceased was then allowed to fall into ruin.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=64}}

The villagers would afterward return to the house of the widow, pull off her lamba and jewelery, uncomb her hair (a sign of mourning), dress her in an old lamba, require her to eat only using a broken spoon and plate they provided, and cover her in a rotting mat which she was forbidden to remove until nightfall. She was required to maintain this mourning state for at least eight months, during which time she was forbidden to wash or speak to others during daylight hours.  After this period she could abandon the mourning ritual and was considered "divorced" (i.e. free to remarry and visit her own parents and family members, previously forbidden); however, if the parents of her deceased husband were still living, only they could declare her divorced, and she was indefinitely required to remain unmarried and forbidden from visiting family if this status was not granted by them.  This practice of declaring divorce, without the mourning ritual, was also applied in the event of separation from a living spouse.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=61}}
&lt;!--
===Dance and music===
--&gt;

==Language==
The Sihanaka speak a dialect of the [[Malagasy language]], which is a branch of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language group]] derived from the [[Barito languages]], spoken in southern [[Borneo]].{{sfn|Adelaar|Himmelmann|2005|page=456}}

==Economy==
By the mid-1600s, the Sihanaka had already established themselves as one of the island's most important trading groups. Their location on the main trade route between the coast and the [[Merina people|Merina]] capital of [[Antananarivo]] enabled them to become important trading partners beginning in the 18th century; slave trading was a major source of income until outlawed under [[Radama I]] in the 1810s.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|page=431}} The Sihanaka women also produced pottery, which was baked using wood collected by men in the surrounding forests.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=155}}

Since the end of slave trading, the Sihanaka largely derived their livelihoods from rice farming. Their region is among the most productive on the island.{{sfn|Thompson|Adloff|1965|page=264}} Wealth is unequally distributed, with the wealthy owning the majority of the fertile land, which is either rented to the poor or worked by them for low wages.{{sfn|Cipollone|2008|page=103}}

Members of this community also herd zebu and catch fish in Lake Alaotra.{{sfn|Thompson|Adloff|1965|page=264}} The work of fishing was traditionally subdivided by gender: men were only allowed to fish for eels, while women were tasked to use nets to catch small fish, and children were the only ones allowed to fish using poles. Men and children would traditionally leave their catch on the shore for women to pick up and take back to the village.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=155}}

The Sihanaka are one of the few Malagasy groups who historically branded their cattle.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=188}} This was done by clipping the ear of the cow and was a religious act conducted once annually on a dedicated day of feasting.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=193}} Cattle generally belonged to the community as a whole and were used principally to assist with farming.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|page=190}}

The '''South Sea Company''' (officially '''The Governor and Company of the merchants of Great Britain, trading to the South Seas and other parts of America, and for the encouragement of fishing''')&lt;ref&gt;Dale, Richard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=z7xLh00p9yAC&amp;pg=PA40 ''The First Crash: Lessons from the South Sea Bubble'']. London: Princeton University Press, 2004. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[joint-stock company]] founded in 1711, created as a [[public-private partnership]] to consolidate and reduce the cost of national debt. The company was also granted a monopoly to trade with South America and nearby islands, hence its name (the modern use of the term "South Seas" to refer to the entire South Pacific was unknown in England at the time). When the company was created, Britain was involved in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and Spain controlled South America. There was no realistic prospect that trade would take place, and the company never realised any significant profit from its monopoly. Company stock rose greatly in value as it expanded its operations dealing in government debt, peaking in 1720 before collapsing to little above its original [[flotation (shares)|flotation]] price; the [[economic bubble]] became known as the '''South Sea Bubble'''.

The [[Bubble Act]] 1720 ([[6 Geo I]], c 18), which forbade the creation of joint-stock companies without [[royal charter]], was promoted by the South Sea company itself before its collapse.

In Great Britain, a considerable number of people were ruined by the share collapse, and the national economy greatly reduced as a result. The founders of the scheme engaged in [[insider trading]], using their advance knowledge of when national debt was to be consolidated to make large profits from purchasing debt in advance. Huge bribes were given to politicians to support the [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] necessary for the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Marshall, (1962) ''Eighteenth Century England'' pp 121-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Company money was used to deal in its own shares, and selected individuals purchasing shares were given loans backed by those same shares to spend on purchasing more shares. The expectation of profits from trade with South America was used to encourage the public to purchase shares, but the bubble prices reached far beyond the profits of the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Paul, (2013) ''The South Sea Bubble: An Economic History of its Origins and Consequences'' ch 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

A parliamentary enquiry was held after the crash to discover its causes. A number of politicians were disgraced, and people found to have profited unlawfully from the company had assets confiscated proportionate to their gains (most had already been rich men and remained comfortably rich). The company was restructured and continued to operate for more than a century after the Bubble. The headquarters were in [[Threadneedle Street]] at the centre of the financial district in London. At the time of these events the [[Bank of England]] also was a private company dealing in national debt, and the crash of its rival consolidated its position as banker to the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Thornbury. 'Threadneedle Street',  [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol1/pp531-544 Old and New London: Volume 1 (London, 1878), pp. 531-544]   via British History Online (accessed 21 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation ==
In August 1710 [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]] was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in a government of commission. The government at this time had become reliant on the [[Bank of England]]. This was a privately owned company, chartered 16 years previously, which had obtained a monopoly as the lender to Westminster, in return for arranging and managing loans to the government. The government had become dissatisfied with the service it was receiving and Harley was actively seeking new ways to improve the national finances.

A new Parliament met in November 1710 with a resolve to attend to national finances, which were suffering significantly from [[List of wars involving Great Britain|two simultaneous wars]]: the [[War of the Spanish Succession|war with France]], which ended in 1713, and the [[Great Northern War]], which was not to end until 1721. Harley came prepared, with detailed accounts of the situation of the national debt, which was customarily a piecemeal affair, with different government departments arranging their own loans as the need arose. He released the information steadily, continually adding new reports of debts incurred and scandalous expenditure, until in January 1711 the House of Commons agreed to appoint a committee to investigate the entire debt. The committee included Harley himself; the two [[Auditor of the Imprests|Auditors of the Imprests]], whose task was to investigate government spending; Harley's brother [[Edward Harley (1664–1735)|Edward]]; and Paul Foley, his brother-in-law. Also included were the [[Secretary of the Treasury]], [[William Lowndes (British politician)|William Lowndes]], who had had significant responsibility for reminting the entire debased British coinage in 1696; and [[John Aislabie]] who represented the [[October Club]], a group of around 200 MPs who had agreed to vote together.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.40, 48-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Harley's first concern was to find £300,000 for the next quarter's pay for the British army operating in Europe under [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough]]. This was provided by a private consortium of [[Edward Gibbon#Early life: 1737–1752|Edward Gibbon]],&lt;ref&gt;grandfather of [[Edward Gibbon|the historian]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Caswall]] and [[C. Hoare &amp; Co|Hoare's Bank]]. The Bank of England had been operating a state lottery on behalf of the government, but this had not been particularly successful in 1710, and another had already begun in 1711. This too was performing poorly, so Harley granted authority to sell tickets to [[Sir John Blunt, 1st Baronet|John Blunt]], a director of the [[Hollow Sword Blade Company]], which despite its name was an unofficial bank. With sales commencing on 3 March 1711, tickets had completely sold out by the 7th. This was the first truly successful English state lottery.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

The success was shortly followed by another, larger, lottery, "The Two Million Adventure" or "The Classis", with tickets costing £100, a top prize of £20,000 and every ticket winning a prize of at least £10. Although prizes were advertised by their total amount, they were paid in the form of a fixed annuity over a period of years, so that the government effectively held the prize money as a loan until it was paid out to the winners. Marketing was handled by members of the Sword Blade syndicate, Gibbon selling £200,000 of tickets and earning £4,500 commission, and Blunt selling £993,000. Charles Blunt (a relative) was made Paymaster of the lottery with expenses of £5,000.

=== Conception of the Company ===
The national debt investigation had concluded that a total of £9,000,000 was owed, without any allocated income to pay it off. Edward Harley and John Blunt together had devised a scheme to consolidate this debt in much the same way that the Bank of England had consolidated previous debts, although the Bank still held the monopoly on operating as a bank. All holders of the debt would be required to surrender it to a new company, the South Sea Company, which in return would issue shares to the same amount. The government would pay the company £568,279 10s 0d (6% interest plus expenses) annually, which would be distributed as a dividend to shareholders. The company was also given a monopoly to trade with South America, a potentially lucrative enterprise, but one controlled by Spain, with whom Britain was at war.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Carswell p.52-54&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, when continental America was being explored and colonized, Europeans applied the term "South Seas" only to South America and surrounding waters. The concession both held out the potential for future profits and encouraged a desire for an end to the war, necessary if any profits were to be made. The original suggestion for the South Sea scheme came from [[William Paterson (banker)|William Paterson]], one of the founders of the Bank of England and the financially disastrous [[Darien Scheme]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Harley was rewarded for the scheme by being created Earl of Oxford on 23 May 1711, and was promoted to [[Lord High Treasurer]]. With a more secure position, he began secret peace negotiations with France. Commercially, since the lotteries were discredited, some of the debt intended to be consolidated under the scheme was available in the open market before the scheme was announced, at a discounted rate of £55 per £100 nominal value. This allowed anyone with advance knowledge to buy debt cheap and sell at an immediate profit, and made it possible for Harley to bring further financial supporters into the scheme, such as James Bateman and [[Sir Theodore Janssen, 1st Baronet|Theodore Janssen]].&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Defoe]] commented:&lt;ref&gt;Defoe, Daniel, ''An Essay on the South-Sea Trade'' ... , 2nd ed., (London, England:  J. Baker, 1712), [https://books.google.com/books?id=NZ5VAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 40-41.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unless the Spaniards are to be divested of common sense, infatuate, and given up, abandoning their own commerce, throwing away the only valuable stake they have left in the world, and in short, bent on their own ruin, we cannot suggest that they will ever, on any consideration, or for any equivalent, part with so valuable, indeed so inestimable a jewel, as the exclusive trade to their own plantations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The originators of the scheme knew that there was no money to invest in a trading venture, and no realistic expectation that there would ever be a trade to exploit, but the potential for great wealth was widely publicised at every opportunity, so as to encourage interest in the scheme. The objective for the founders was to create a company which they could use to become wealthy, and which offered future scope for further government deals.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flotation ===
[[File:Bubble.folly.jpg|thumb|right|The "night singer of shares" sold stock on the streets during the South Sea Bubble (Amsterdam, 1720)]]
The Charter for the company was drawn up by Blunt, based on that of the Bank of England. Blunt was paid £3,846 for his services in setting up the company. Directors would be elected every three years and shareholders would meet twice a year. The company employed a Cashier, Secretary and Accountant. The Governor was intended to be an honorary position, and the position was later customarily held by the ruling monarch. The charter allowed the full court of directors to nominate a smaller committee to act on any matter on its behalf. Directors of the Bank of England and of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] were disbarred from being a director of the South Sea Company. Any ship of more than 500 tons owned by the company was to have a Church of England clergyman on board.

The exchange of government debt for stock was to occur in five separate lots. The first two of these, totaling £2.75 million from about 200 large investors, had already been arranged before the company's charter was issued on 10 September 1711. The government itself exchanged £0.75 million of its own debt held by different departments (at this time, individual office holders were responsible for money in their charge, and were at liberty to invest it to their own advantage before it was required). Harley exchanged £8,000 of debt and was appointed Governor of the new company. Blunt, Caswall and Sawbridge together provided £65,000, Janssen £25,000 of his own plus £250,000 from a foreign consortium, Decker £49,000, Sir Ambrose Crawley £36,791. The company had a Sub-Governor, Bateman; a Deputy Governor, Ongley; and 30 ordinary directors. In total, nine of the directors were politicians, five were members of the Sword Blade consortium, and seven more were financial magnates who had been attracted to the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.57,58&lt;/ref&gt;

The company created a coat of arms with the motto ''A Gadibus usque ad Auroram'' ("from Cadiz to the dawn") and rented a large house in the City as its headquarters. Seven sub-committees were created to handle its everyday business, the most important being the "Committee for the affairs of the company". The Sword Blade company was retained as their banker and on the strength of its new government connections issued notes in its own right, notwithstanding the Bank of England monopoly. The task of the Company Secretary was to oversee trading activities; the Accountant, Grigsby, was responsible for registering and issuing stock; and the Cashier, Robert Knight, acted as Blunt's personal assistant at a salary of £200 per year.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.60-63&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The slave trade ===
The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 granted Britain an ''[[Asiento]]'' lasting 30 years to supply the Spanish colonies with 4,800 slaves per year. Britain was permitted to open offices in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Caracas]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Havana]], [[Panama]], [[Portobelo, Colón|Portobello]] and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] to arrange the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. One ship of no more than 500 tons could be sent to one of these places each year (the ''Navío de Permiso'') with general trade goods. One quarter of the profits were to be reserved for the King of Spain. There was provision for two extra sailings at the start of the contract. The Asiento was granted in the name of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and then contracted to the company.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p. 64-66&lt;/ref&gt;

By July the company had arranged contracts with the [[Royal African Company]] to supply the necessary African slaves to Jamaica. Ten pounds was paid for a slave aged over 16, £8 for one under 16 but over 10. Two-thirds were to be male, and 90% adult. The company trans-shipped 1,230 slaves from Jamaica to America in the first year, plus any that might have been added (against standing instructions) by the ship's captains on their own behalf. On arrival of the first cargoes, the local authorities refused to accept the Asiento, which had still not been officially confirmed there by the Spanish authorities. The slaves were eventually sold at a loss in the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1714 the government announced that a quarter of profits would be reserved for the Queen and a further 7.5% for a financial advisor, Manasseh Gilligan. Some Company board members refused to accept the contract on these terms, and the government was obliged to reverse its decision.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these setbacks, the company continued, having raised £200,000 to finance the operations. In 1714 2,680 slaves were carried, and for 1716–17, 13,000 more, but the trade continued to be unprofitable. An import duty of 33 [[Spanish dollar|pieces of eight]] was charged on each slave (although for this purpose some slaves might be counted only as a fraction of a slave, depending on quality). One of the extra trade ships was sent to Cartagena in 1714 carrying woollen goods, despite warnings that there was no market for them there, and they remained unsold for two years.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changes of management ===
The company was heavily dependent on the goodwill of government; when the government changed, so too did the company board. In 1714 one of the directors who had been sponsored by Harley, Arthur Moore, had attempted to send 60 tons of private goods on board the company ship. He was dismissed as a director, but the result was the beginning of Harley's fall from favour with the company. On 27 July 1714, Harley was replaced as Lord High Treasurer as a result of a disagreement that had broken out within the Tory faction in parliament. Queen Anne died on 1 August 1714; and at the election of directors in 1715 the Prince of Wales (the future King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]) was elected as Governor of the Company. The new King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] and the Prince of Wales both had significant holdings in the company, as did some prominent Whig politicians, including [[James Craggs the Elder]], the Earl of Halifax and Sir Joseph Jekyll. James Craggs, as Postmaster General, was responsible for intercepting mail on behalf of the government to obtain political and financial information. All Tory politicians were removed from the board and replaced with businessmen. The Whigs Horatio Townshend, brother in law of [[Robert Walpole]], and the [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] were elected directors.

The new government led to a revival of the company's share value, which had fallen below its issue price. The previous government had failed to make the interest payments to the company for the last two years, owing more than £1 million. The new administration insisted the debt be written off, but allowed the company to issue new shares to stockholders to the value of the missed payments. At around £10 million, this now represented half the share capital issued in the entire country. In 1714 the company had 2,000 to 3,000 shareholders, more than either of its rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.67-70&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the next directors' elections in 1718 politics had changed again, with a schism within the Whigs between Walpole's faction supporting the Prince of Wales and [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|James Stanhope]]'s supporting the King. Argyll and Townshend were dismissed as directors, as were surviving Tories Sir Richard Hoare and George Pitt, and King George I became governor. Four MPs remained directors, as did six people holding government financial offices. The Sword Blade Company remained bankers to the South Sea, and indeed had flourished despite the company's dubious legal position. Blunt and Sawbridge remained South Sea directors, and they had been joined by Gibbon and Child. Caswall had retired as a South Sea director to concentrate on the Sword Blade business. In November 1718 Sub-Governor Bateman and Deputy Governor Shepheard both died. Leaving aside the honorary position of Governor, this left the company suddenly without its two most senior and experienced directors. They were replaced by Sir John Fellowes as Sub-Governor and Charles Joye as Deputy.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.73-75&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War ===
In 1718 war broke out with Spain once again, in the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]]. The company's assets in South America were seized, which the company claimed cost it £300,000. Any prospect of profit from trade, for which the company had purchased ships and had been planning its next ventures, disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.75-76&lt;/ref&gt;

== Refinancing government debt ==
Events in France now came to influence the future of the company. A Scottish economist and financier, [[John Law (economist)|John Law]], exiled after killing a man in a duel, had travelled around Europe before settling in France. There he founded a bank, which in December 1718 became the Banque Royale, national bank of France, while Law himself was granted sweeping powers to control the economy of France, which operated largely by royal decree. Law's remarkable success was known in financial circles throughout Europe, and now came to inspire Blunt and his associates to make greater efforts to grow their own concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.88-89&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1719 Craggs explained to the House of Commons a new scheme for improving the national debt by converting the annuities issued after the 1710 lottery into South Sea stock. By Act of Parliament, the company was granted the right to issue £1,150 of new stock for every £100 per annum of annuity which was surrendered. The government would pay 5% per annum on the stock created, which would halve their annual bill. The conversion was voluntary, amounting to £2.5 million new stock if all converted. The company was to make an additional new loan to the government pro-rata up to £750,000, again at 5%.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Sea company presented the offer to the public in July 1719. In March there was an abortive attempt to restore the Old Pretender, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Edward Stuart]], to the throne of Britain, with a small landing of troops in Scotland. They were defeated at the [[Battle of Glen Shiel]] on 10 June. The Sword Blade company spread a rumour that the Pretender had been captured, and the general euphoria encouraged the South Sea share price to rise from £100, where it had been in the spring, to £114. Annuitants were still paid out at the same money value of shares, the company keeping the profit from the rise in value before issuing. About two-thirds of the in-force annuities were exchanged.

=== Trading more debt for equity ===

In the bottom left corner are Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish figures gambling, while in the middle there is a huge machine, like a merry-go-round, which people are boarding. At the top is a goat, written below which is "Who'l Ride". The people are scattered around the picture with a sense of disorder, while the progress of the well-dressed people towards the ride in the middle represents the foolishness of the crowd in buying stock in the South Sea Company, which spent more time issuing stock than anything else.]]

The 1719 scheme was a distinct success from the government's perspective, and they sought to repeat it. Negotiations took place between Aislabie and Craggs for the government and Blunt, Cashier Knight and his assistant and Caswell. Janssen, the Sub Governor and Deputy Governor were also consulted but negotiations remained secret from most of the company. News from France was of fortunes being made investing in Law's bank, whose shares had risen sharply. Money was moving around Europe, and other flotations threatened to soak up available capital (two insurance schemes in December 1719 each sought to raise £3 million).&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.100-102&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans were made for a new scheme to take over most of the unconsolidated national debt of Britain (£30,981,712) in exchange for company shares. Annuities were valued as a lump sum necessary to produce the annual income over the original term at an assumed interest of 5%, which favoured those with shorter terms still to run. The government agreed to pay the same amount to the company for all the fixed term repayable debt as it had been paying before, but after seven years the 5% interest rate would fall to 4% on both the new annuity debt and also that taken over previously. After the first year, the company was to give the government £3 million in four quarterly installments. New stock would be created at a face value equal to the debt, but the share price was still rising and sales of the remaining stock, i.e. the excess of the total market value of the stock over the amount of the debt, would be used to raise the government fee plus a profit for the company. The more the price rose in advance of conversion, the more the company would make. Before the scheme, payments were costing the government £1.5 million per year.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Carswell p.102-107&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the total government debt in 1719 was £50 million:

* £18.3m was held by three large corporations:
** £3.4m by the [[Bank of England]]
** £3.2m by the [[British East India Company]]
** £11.7m by the South Sea Company
* Privately held redeemable debt amounted to £16.5m
* £15m consisted of irredeemable annuities, long-fixed-term annuities of 72–87 years, and short annuities of 22 years remaining to expiry.

The purpose of this conversion was similar to the old one: debt holders and annuitants might receive less return in total, but an illiquid investment was transformed into shares which could be readily traded. Shares backed by national debt were considered a safe investment and a convenient way to hold and move money: far easier and safer than metal coins. The only alternative safe asset, land, was much harder to sell and it was legally much more complex to transfer ownership.

The government received a cash payment and lower overall interest on the debt. Importantly, it also gained control over when the debt had to be repaid, which was not before seven years but then at its discretion. This avoided the risk that debt might become repayable at some future point just when the government needed to borrow more, and could be forced into paying higher interest rates. The payment to the government was to be used to buy in any debt not subscribed to the scheme, which although it helped the government also helped the company by removing possibly competing securities from the market, including large holdings by the Bank of England.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

Company stock was now trading at £123, so the issue amounted to an injection of £5 million of new money into a booming economy just as interest rates were falling. [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) for Britain at this point was estimated as £64.4 million.[http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/budget_pie_ukgs.php?span=ukgs302&amp;year=1717&amp;view=1&amp;expand=&amp;units=b&amp;fy=2010&amp;state=UK#ukgs302]

==== Public announcement ====
On 21 January the plan was presented to the board of the South Sea Company, and on 22 January [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[John Aislabie]] presented it to Parliament. The House was stunned into silence, but on recovering proposed that the Bank of England should be invited to make a better offer. In response, the South Sea increased its cash payment to £3.5 million, while the Bank proposed to undertake the conversion with a payment of £5.5 million and a fixed conversion price of £170 per £100 face value Bank stock. On 1 February, the company negotiators led by Blunt raised their offer to £4 million plus a proportion of £3.5 million depending on how much of the debt was converted. They also agreed that the interest rate would reduce after four years instead of seven, and agreed to sell on behalf of the government £1 million of Exchequer bills (formerly handled by the Bank). The House accepted the South Sea offer. Bank stock fell sharply.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.112-113&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the first sign of difficulty came when the South Sea Company announced that its Christmas 1719 dividend would be deferred for 12 months. The company now embarked on a show of gratitude to its friends. Select individuals were sold a parcel of company stock at the current price. The transactions were recorded by Knight in the names of intermediaries, but no payments were received and no stock issued – indeed the company had none to issue until the conversion of debt began. The individual received an option to sell his stock back to the company at any future date at whatever market price might then apply. Shares went to the Craggs: [[James Craggs the Elder|the Elder]] and [[James Craggs the Younger|the Younger]]; [[John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower|Lord Gower]]; [[George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]]; and four other MPs. [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] would gain £500 for every pound that stock rose; George I's mistress, their children and Countess Platen £120 per pound rise, Aislabie £200 per pound, [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] £600 per pound. Others invested money, including the [[Richard Hampden (1674–1728)|Treasurer to the Navy, Hampden]], who invested £25,000 of government money on his own behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.114-118&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal was accepted in a slightly altered form in April 1720. Crucial in this conversion was the proportion of holders of irredeemable annuities who could be tempted to convert their securities at a high price for the new shares. (Holders of redeemable debt had effectively no other choice but to subscribe.) The South Sea Company could set the conversion price but could not diverge much from the market price of its shares. The company ultimately acquired 85% of the redeemables and 80% of the irredeemables.

=== Inflating the share price ===
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ssbprice.jpg|thumb|The South Sea share]] --&gt;
[[File:South-sea-bubble-chart.png|thumb|right|Chart of company stock prices.]]
The company then set to talking up its stock with "the most extravagant rumours" of the value of its potential trade in the New World; this was followed by a wave of "speculating frenzy". The share price had risen from the time the scheme was proposed: from £128 in January 1720, to £175 in February, £330 in March and, following the scheme's acceptance, £550 at the end of May.

What may have supported the company's high multiples (its [[P/E ratio]]) was a fund of credit (known to the market) of £70 million available for commercial expansion which had been made available through substantial support, apparently, by Parliament and the King.

Shares in the company were "sold" to politicians at the current market price; however, rather than paying for the shares, these recipients simply held on to what shares they had been offered, with the option of selling them back to the company when and as they chose, receiving as "profit" the increase in market price. This method, while winning over the heads of government, the King's mistress, et al., also had the advantage of binding their interests to the interests of the Company: in order to secure their own profits, they had to help drive up the stock. Meanwhile, by publicising the names of their elite stockholders, the Company managed to clothe itself in an aura of legitimacy, which attracted and kept other buyers.

=== Bubble Act ===
{{Main|Bubble Act}}
The South Sea Company was by no means the only company seeking to raise money from investors in 1720. A large number of other joint-stock companies had been created making extravagant (sometimes fraudulent) claims about foreign or other ventures or bizarre schemes. Others represented potentially sound, although novel, schemes, such as for founding insurance companies. These were nicknamed "Bubbles". Some of the companies had no legal basis, while others, such as the Hollow Sword Blade company acting as the South Sea's banker, used existing chartered companies for purposes entirely different from their creation. The York Buildings Company was set up to provide water to London, but was purchased by Case Billingsley who used it to purchase confiscated Jacobite estates in Scotland, which then formed the assets of an insurance company.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Carswell p.116-117&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 1720 John Hungerford raised the question of bubble companies in the House of Commons, and persuaded the House to set up a committee, which he chaired, to investigate. He identified a number of companies which between them sought to raise £40 million in capital. The committee investigated the companies, establishing a principle that companies should not be operating outside the objects specified in their charters. A potential embarrassment for the South Sea was avoided when the question of the Hollow Sword Blade Company arose. Difficulty was avoided by flooding the committee with MPs who were supporters of the South Sea, and voting down the proposal to investigate the Hollow Sword by 75 to 25. (At this time, committees of the House were either 'Open' or 'secret'. A secret committee was one with a fixed set of members who could vote on its proceedings. By contrast, any MP could join in with an 'open' committee and vote on its proceedings.) Stanhope, who was a member of the committee, received £50,000 of the 'resaleable' South Sea stock from Sawbridge, a director of the Hollow Sword, at about this time. Hungerford had previously been expelled from the Commons for accepting a bribe.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

Amongst the bubble companies investigated were two supported by Lords Onslow and Chetwynd respectively, for insuring shipping. These were criticised heavily, and the questionable dealings of the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General in trying to obtain charters for the companies led to both being replaced. However, the schemes had the support of [[Robert Walpole|Walpole]] and [[James Craggs the Younger|Craggs]], so that the larger part of the Bubble Act (which finally resulted in June 1720 from the committee's investigations) was devoted to creating charters for the [[Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation]] and the [[London Assurance Corporation]]. The companies were required to pay £300,000 for the privilege. The Act required that a joint stock company could only be incorporated by Act of Parliament or [[Royal charter]]. The prohibition on unauthorised joint stock ventures was not repealed until 1825.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.138-140&lt;/ref&gt;

The passing of the Act gave a boost to the South Sea Company, its shares leaping to £890 in early June. This peak encouraged people to start to sell; to counterbalance this the company's directors ordered their agents to buy, which succeeded in propping the price up at around £750.

[[File:South Sea Bubble Cards-Tree.png|thumb|200px|Tree caricature from Bubble Cards.]]
The price of the stock went up over the course of a single year from about £100 to almost £1000 per share. Its success caused a country-wide frenzy—[[herd behavior]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Helen Julia (2010) The South Sea Bubble: an economic history of its origins and consequences, Routledge Explorations in Economic History, Routledge, London.&lt;/ref&gt;—as all types of people, from peasants to lords, developed a feverish interest in investing: in South Seas primarily, but in stocks generally. Among the many companies to go public in 1720 is—famously—one that advertised itself as "a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is".&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Mackay (author)|Charles Mackay]], ''[[Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds]]'' (Harriman House Classics 2003), pp 53, 65, 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The price finally reached £1,000 in early August, and the level of selling was such that the price started to fall, dropping back to £100 per share before the year was out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Der geplatzte Traum vom schnellen Geld |language=German |first=Peter |last=Alter |authorlink=Peter Alter |work=[[Damals]] |year=2018 |volume=50 |issue=8 |pages=72–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; This triggered [[bankruptcy|bankruptcies]] amongst those who had bought on credit, and increased selling, even [[short selling]] (i.e., selling borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back at a profit if the price fell).{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Also, in August 1720, the first of the installment payments of the first and second money subscriptions on new issues of South Sea stock were due. Earlier in the year John Blunt had come up with an idea to prop up the share price: the company would lend people money to buy its shares. As a result, many shareholders could not pay for their shares except by selling them.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Furthermore, a scramble for liquidity appeared internationally as "bubbles" were also ending in Amsterdam and Paris. The collapse coincided with the fall of the [[Mississippi Company]] of [[John Law (economist)|John Law]] in France. As a result, the price of South Sea shares began to decline.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

=== Recriminations ===
By the end of September the stock had fallen to £150. Company failures now extended to [[bank]]s and [[goldsmith]]s as they could not collect loans made on the stock, and thousands of individuals were ruined, including many members of the [[aristocracy]]. With investors outraged, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was recalled in December and an investigation began. Reporting in 1721, it revealed widespread [[fraud]] amongst the company directors and corruption in the Cabinet. Among those implicated were [[John Aislabie]] (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), [[James Craggs the Elder]] (the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]]), [[James Craggs the Younger]] (the [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department|Southern Secretary]]), and even [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] (the heads of the Ministry). Craggs the Elder and Craggs the Younger both died in disgrace; the remainder were [[impeached]] for their corruption. The Commons found Aislabie guilty of the "most notorious, dangerous and infamous corruption", and he was imprisoned.

The newly appointed [[First Lord of the Treasury]] [[Robert Walpole]] successfully  restored public confidence in the financial system.  However, public opinion, as shaped by the many prominent men who lost money, demanded revenge. Walpole supervised the process which removed all 33 of the company directors and stripped them of, on average, 82% of their wealth.  The money went to the victims and the stock of the South Sea Company was divided between the Bank of England and the East India Company.  Walpole made sure that King George and his mistresses were protected, and by the margin of three votes he managed to save several key government officials from impeachment. In the process Walpole won plaudits as the savior of the financial system while establishing himself as the dominant figure in British politics; historians credit him for rescuing the Whig government, and indeed the Hanoverian Dynasty, from total disgrace.&lt;ref&gt; Marshall, pp 127-30. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Kleer, "Riding a wave: the Company’s role in the South Sea Bubble" (2015) p 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Taylor, "Walpole, Robert, first earl of Orford (1676–1745)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quotations prompted by the collapse ===
Joseph Spence wrote that [[Earl of Radnor|Lord Radnor]] reported to him "When Sir [[Isaac Newton]] was asked about the continuance of the rising of South Sea stock... He answered 'that he could not calculate the madness of people'."&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Anecdotes, 1820, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also quoted as stating, "I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men".&lt;ref&gt;John O'Farrell, An Utterly Impartial History of Britain – Or 2000 Years of Upper Class Idiots In Charge (October 22, 2007) (2007, Doubleday, {{ISBN|978-0-385-61198-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Newton himself owned nearly £22,000 in South Sea stock in 1722, but it is not known how much he lost, if anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard S. Westfall|title=Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ngEugMMa9YC&amp;pg=PA861|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=861–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== A trading company ==
The South Sea Company was created in 1711 to reduce the size of public debts, but was granted the commercial privilege of exclusive rights of trade to the Spanish Indies, based on the treaty of commerce signed by Britain and the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]], candidate to the Spanish throne during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. After [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] became the King of Spain, Britain obtained at the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]] the rights to the slave trade to the Spanish Indies (or [[Asiento]]) for 30 years. Those rights were previously held by the [[Compagnie de Guinée et de l'Assiente du Royaume de la France]].

The South Sea Company board opposed taking on the slave trade that had showed little profitability when chartered companies had engaged in it, but it was the only legal type of commerce with the Spanish Colonies as they were a closed market{{clarify|date=February 2014}}. To increase the profitability, the Asiento contract included the right to send one yearly 500 ton ship to the fairs at Portobello and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] loaded with duty-free merchandises, called the ''Navío de Permiso''.
The Crown of England and the King of Spain were each entitled to 25% of the profits, according to the terms of the contract, that was a copy of the French Asiento contract, but [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] soon renounced her share. The King of Spain did not receive any payments due to him, and this was one of the sources of contention between the Spanish Crown and the South Sea Company.

As was the case for previous holders of the Asiento, the Portuguese and the French, the profit was not in the slave trade but in the illegal contraband goods smuggled in the slave ships and in the annual ship. Those goods were sold at the Spanish colonies at a handsome price as they were in high demand and constituted unfair competition with taxed goods, proving an important drain on the Spanish Crown trade income.
The relationship between the South Sea Company and the Government of Spain was always bad, and worsened with time. The Company complained of searches and seizures of goods, lack of profitability, and confiscation of properties during the wars between Britain and Spain of 1718–1723 and 1727–1729, during which the operations of the Company were suspended. The Government of Spain complained of the illegal trade, failure of the company to present its accounts as stipulated by the contract, and non-payment of the King's share of the profits.
These claims were a major cause of deteriorating relations between the two countries in 1738; and although the Prime Minister [[Robert Walpole|Walpole]] opposed war, there was strong support for it from the King, the House of Commons, and a faction in his own Cabinet. Walpole was able to negotiate a treaty with the King of Spain at the [[Convention of Pardo]] in January 1739 that stipulated that Spain would pay British merchants £95,000 in compensation for captures and seized goods, while the South Sea Company would pay the Spanish Crown £68,000 in due proceeds from the Asiento. The South Sea Company refused to pay those proceeds and the King of Spain retained payment of the compensation until payment from the South Sea Company could be secured. The break up of relations between the South Sea Company and the Spanish Government was a prelude to the ''[[War of Jenkins' Ear|Guerra del Asiento]]'', as the first [[Royal Navy]] fleets departed in July 1739 for the Caribbean, prior to the declaration of war, which lasted from October 1739 until 1748. This war is known as the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson (1945) states that the substantial illicit trade pursued by the South Sea Company officials under the Asiento “must be considered as a major cause of the War of Jenkins' Ear because it threatened to destroy the entire commercial framework of the Spanish Empire&amp;nbsp;... Unable to accept the destruction of its commercial system, Spain attempted to negotiate but requested that the company, as an evidence of good faith, should open its accounts for inspection by the Spanish representatives. Naturally, the directors refused, for compliance would have meant the complete exposure of the illegal traffic. Neither Spain nor the South Sea Company would yield. War was the inevitable result”.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1926, p. 663) says that The failure to comply with the accounting provisions of the Asiento treaty (in the context of Spanish knowledge of secret accounts kept by the South Sea Company which would prove clandestine trading) was a constant source of the friction which culminated in armed conflict.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Hildner (1938), the war of 1739 might have been averted if the issues addressed by the commission established in 1732 to settle disputes over the Asiento had been resolved.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slave trade under the Asiento ===
{{Main|Asiento}}
[[File:1713 Asiento contract.png|thumb|Cover of the English translation of the Asiento contract signed by Britain and Spain in 1713 as part of the Utrecht treaty that ended the War of Spanish Succession. The contract granted exclusive rights to Britain to sell slaves in the Spanish Indies.]]
Under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], Spain was the only European power that could not establish factories in Africa to purchase slaves. The slaves for the Spanish America were provided by companies that were granted exclusive rights to their trade. This monopoly contract was called the slave [[Asiento]]. Between 1701 and 1713 the Asiento contract was granted to France. In 1711 Britain had created the South Sea Company to reduce debt and to trade with the Spanish America, but that commerce was illegal without a permit from Spain, and the only existing permit was the Asiento for the slave trade, so at the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 Britain obtained the transfer of the Asiento contract from French to British hands for the next 30 years.
The board of directors was reluctant to take on the slave trade that was not an object of the company and had shown little profitability when carried out by chartered companies, but they finally agreed on 26 March 1714. The Asiento set a sale quota of 4800 units of slaves per year. An adult male slave counted as one unit; females and children counted as fractions of a unit. Initially the slaves were provided by the [[Royal African Company]].

The South Sea Company established slave reception factories at [[Cartagena, Colombia]], [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz, Mexico]], Panama, [[Portobelo, Colón|Portobello]], [[La Guaira]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[La Havana]] and [[Santiago de Cuba]], and slave deposits at [[Jamaica]] and [[Barbados]]. Despite problems with speculation, the South Sea Company was relatively successful at [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trading]] and meeting its quota (it was unusual for other, similarly chartered companies to fulfill their quotas). According to records compiled by David Eltis and others, during the course of 96 voyages in 25 years, the South Sea Company purchased 34,000 slaves, of whom 30,000 survived the voyage across the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&amp;url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/wm/58.1/eltis.html|title=History Cooperative – A Short History of Nearly Everything!|website=History Cooperative|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20091020132439/http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&amp;url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/wm/58.1/eltis.html|archivedate=2009-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Thus about 11% of the slaves died on the voyage: a relatively low mortality rate for the [[Middle Passage|Middle Crossing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/paul.doc|title=The South Sea Company’s slaving activities|first=Helen|last=Paul|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209151433/http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/paul.doc|archivedate=2012-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The company persisted with the slave trade through two wars with Spain and the calamitous 1720 commercial [[Economic bubble|bubble]]. The company's trade in human slavery peaked during the 1725 trading year, five years after the bubble burst.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, H.J. (2010). ''The South Sea Bubble''.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1715 and 1739, slave trading constituted the main legal commercial activity of the South Sea Company.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== The annual ship ===
The slave Asiento contract of 1713 granted a permit to send one vessel of 500 tons per year, loaded with duty-free merchandise to be sold at the fairs of [[New Spain]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], and [[Portobelo, Colón|Portobello]]. This was an unprecedented concession that broke two centuries of strict exclusion of foreign merchants from the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, G. J. (1979), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ship to head for the Americas, the ''Royal Prince'', was scheduled for 1714 but was delayed until August 1716. In consideration of the three annual ships missed since the date of the Asiento, the permitted tonnage of the next ten ships was raised to 650.&lt;ref&gt;Archivo General de Indias, Seville, Spain IG2785&lt;/ref&gt; Actually only seven annual ships sailed during the Asiento, the last one being the Royal Caroline in 1732. The company's failure to produce accounts for all the annual ships but the first one, and lack of payment of the proceeds to the Spanish Crown from the profits for all the annual ships, resulted in no more permits being granted to the Company's ships after the Royal Caroline trip of 1732–1734.

In contrast to the legitimate trade in slaves, the regular trade of the annual ships generated healthy returns, in some case profits were over 100%.&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, (1940), pp. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts for the voyage of the ''Royal Prince'' were not presented until 1733, following continuous demands by Spanish officials. They reported that profits of £43,607.&lt;ref&gt;Archivo General de Indias, Seville, Spain C266L3&lt;/ref&gt; Since the King of Spain was entitled to 25% of the profits, after deducting interest on a loan he claimed £8,678. The South Sea Company never paid the amount due for the first annual ship to the Spanish Crown, nor did it pay any amount for any of the other six trips.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Arctic whaling ===
&lt;!--former section heading retained as an anchor to preserve backlinks--&gt;
The Greenland Company had been established by Act of Parliament in 1693 with the object of catching whales in the Arctic. The products of their "whale-fishery" were to be free of Customs and other duties. Partly due to maritime disruption caused by wars with France, the Greenland Company failed financially within a few years. In 1722 Henry Elking published a proposal, directed at the governors of the South Sea Company, that they should resume the "Greenland Trade" and send ships to catch whales in the Arctic. He made very detailed suggestions about how the ships should be crewed and equipped.&lt;ref&gt;Elking, Henry [1722](1980). ''A view of the Greenland Trade and whale-fishery''. Reprinted: Whitby: Caedmon. {{ISBN|0-905355-13-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Parliament confirmed that a British Arctic "whale-fishery" would continue to benefit from freedom from Customs duties, and in 1724 the South Sea Company decided to commence whaling. They had 12 whale-ships built on the River Thames and these went to the Greenland seas in 1725. Further ships were built in later years, but the venture was not successful. There were hardly any experienced whalemen remaining in Britain, and the Company had to engage Dutch and Danish whalemen for the key posts aboard their ships: for instance all commanding officers and harpooners were hired from the [[North Frisia]]n island of [[Föhr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Uwe |last=Zacchi |language=German |title=Menschen von Föhr. Lebenswege aus drei Jahrhunderten |publisher=Boyens &amp; Co. |location=Heide |year=1986 |ISBN=3-8042-0359-0 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other costs were badly controlled and the catches remained disappointingly few, even though the Company was sending up to 25 ships to [[Davis Strait]] and the [[Greenland]] seas in some years. By 1732 the Company had accumulated a net loss of £177,782 from their eight years of Arctic whaling.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Adam [1801](1967). ''The Origin of Commerce''. Reprinted: New York: Kelley.&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Sea Company directors appealed to the British government for further support. Parliament had passed an Act in 1732 that extended the duty-free concessions for a further nine years. In 1733 an Act was passed that also granted a government subsidy to British Arctic whalers, the first in a long series of such Acts that continued and modified the whaling subsidies throughout the 18th century. This, and the subsequent Acts, required the whalers to meet conditions regarding the crewing and equipping of the whale-ships that closely resembled the conditions suggested by Elking in 1722.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Martin H. (2005). Statutory requirements regarding surgeons on British whale-ships. ''The Mariner's Mirror'' '''91''' (1) 7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
In spite of the extended duty-free concessions, and the prospect of real subsidies as well, the Court and Directors of the South Sea Company decided that they could not expect to make profits from Arctic whaling. They sent out no more whale-ships after the loss-making 1732 season.

== Government debt after the Seven Years' War ==
The company continued its trade (when not interrupted by war) until the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763). However, its main function was always managing government debt, rather than trading with the Spanish colonies. The South Sea Company continued its management of the part of the [[Government debt|National Debt]] until it was disestablished in 1853, at which point the debt was reconsolidated. The debt was not paid off by [[World War I]], at which point it was consolidated again, under terms that allowed the government to avoid paying down the principal.

== Armorials ==
The armorials of the South Sea Company, according to a [[grant of arms]] dated 31 October 1711, were: ''Azure, a globe whereon are represented the Straits of Magellan and Cape Horn all proper and in sinister chief point two herrings haurient in saltire argent crowned or, in a canton the united arms of Great Britain''. Crest: ''A ship of three masts in full sail''. Supporters, dexter: ''The emblematic figure of Britannia, with the shield, lance etc all proper''; sinister: ''A fisherman completely clothed, with cap boots fishing net etc and in his hand a string of fish, all proper''.&lt;ref&gt;National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, catalogue entry for sculpture of arms, object ID: HRA0043  [http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/605213.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Officers of the South Sea Company ==
The South Sea Company had a governor (generally an honorary position); a subgovernor; a deputy governor and 30 directors (reduced in 1753 to 21).&lt;ref&gt;See, for 1711–21, J Carswell, ''South Sea Bubble'' (1960) 274-9; and for 1721–1840, see British Library, Add. MSS, 25544-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

[[David Liss]]' historical-mystery novel "[[A Conspiracy of Paper]]", set in 1720 London, is focused on the South Sea Company at the top of its power, its fierce rivalry with the [[Bank of England]] and the events leading up to the collapse of the "bubble".&lt;br&gt;

Charles Dickens novels are littered with stock-market speculations, villains, swindlers and fictional speculators. Little Dorrit (1857) The financial house of Mr Merdle; Martin Chuzzlewit (1844) 'Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Company, modeled loosely on the South Sea Bubble,- is in essence a classic [[Ponzi scheme]]; Nicholas Nickleby (1839) Ralph Nickleby's great Joint Stock Company, United Metropolitan Improved Hot Muffin and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company; David Copperfield (1850) the false accounting by the sycophant Uriah Heep, clerk to lawyer Mr Wickfield;

'''Spectrum Management and Telecommunications program''' is the Department of [[Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada]] that is responsible for setting [[radio]] and [[telecommunications]] [[Technical standard|standards]] and certifying that radio apparatus and equipment meet these standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf01698.html Spectrum Management Standards website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, together with representatives of the radiocommunication industry, developed the Radiocommunication Regulations.

[[Canada]]'s [[Radiocommunication Act]] and Radiocommunication Regulations require that manufacturers, importers, distributors and sellers must [[Test (assessment)|test]] and [[label]] radio apparatus, [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]]-causing equipment or radio-sensitive equipment.

More specifically, equipment must be classified as Category I or II and meet all the technical standards that are required for that type of equipment. Category I equipment must obtain a Technical Acceptance Certificate (TAC) from Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada.

Individuals and corporations that do not comply with the Regulations may face [[Criminal charge|charges]], [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] or [[prison]].

Category I equipment includes [[transmitters]], [[cellular phones]] and [[wireless]] computer links.

'''Taushiro''', also known as '''Pinche''' or '''Pinchi''', is a [[moribund language|nearly extinct]] possible [[language isolate]] of the Peruvian [[Amazon basin|Amazon]] near [[Ecuador]]. In 2000 [[SIL International|SIL]] counted one speaker in an ethnic population of 20. Documentation was done in the mid-1970s by Neftalí Alicea. The last living speaker of Taushiro, Amadeo García García, was profiled in the ''[[New York Times]]'' in 2017.&lt;ref name="Casey2017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Casey |first=Nicholas |title=Thousands Once Spoke His Language in the Amazon.

The first glossary of Taushiro contained 200 words and were collected by Daniel Velie in 1971.&lt;ref name="Casey2017" /&gt;

Following Tovar (1961), Loukotka (1968), and Tovar (1984), [[Terrence Kaufman|Kaufman]] (1994) notes that while Taushiro has been linked to the [[Zaparoan languages]], it shares greater lexical correspondences with [[Kandoshi language|Kandoshi]] and especially with [[Omurano language|Omurano]]. In 2007 he classified Taushiro and Omurano (but not Kandoshi) as [[Saparo–Yawan languages]].

==Amadeo García García==
In June 2015, Amadeo García García was residing in "Intuto on the [[Tigre River]] in the northeastern Peruvian region of [[Loreto Province|Loreto]]." Zachary O’Hagan did targeted field work with him on topics such as [[ethnohistory]], genealogy, sociocultural practices, lexicon, and grammar.&lt;ref name="OHagan_2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~zjohagan/pdflinks/ohagan_fforum_taushiro_isolates_v1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Taushiro and the Status of Language Isolates in Northwest Amazonia |first=Zachary |last=O’Hagan |series=Fieldwork Forum |date=November 17, 2015 |access-date=December 26, 2017 |work=University of California, Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2017 government linguists from Peru’s [[Ministry of Culture (Peru)|Ministry of Culture]], working with Amadeo, have created a database of 1,500 Taushiro words, 27 stories, and three songs.&lt;ref name="Casey2017" /&gt;

{{Taoism condensed}}
The '''Three Treasures''' or '''Three Jewels''' ({{zh|c=[[Wikt:三|三]][[Wikt:寶|寶]]|p=''sānbǎo''| w=''san-pao''}}) are theoretical cornerstones in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and practices such as [[Neidan]], [[Qigong]], and [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]]. They are also known as '''Jing Qi Shen''' ({{zh|c=精氣神|p=''jīng-qì-shén''| w=''ching ch'i shen''}}; "essence, [[qi]], and spirit"). Despeux summarizes.
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Jing'', ''qi'', and ''shen'' are three of the main notions shared by Taoism and Chinese culture alike. They are often referred to as the Three Treasures (''sanbao'' 三寶), an expression that immediately reveals their importance and the close connection among them. The ideas and practices associated with each term, and with the three terms as a whole, are complex and vary considerably in different contexts and historical periods. (2008:562) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This Chinese name ''sanbao'' originally referred to the Taoist "[[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Treasures]]" (from ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' 67, tr. Waley 1958:225, "pity", "frugality", and "refusal to be 'foremost of all things under heaven'") and subsequently translated the Buddhist [[Three Jewels]] (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha). (This is incorrect, The Three Jewels in Buddhism is a completely different philosophy.  The Buddha is the teacher, the Dharma is the teaching, and the Sangha is the community.  "Rest in the Three Jewels," as a means to enlightenment.  They are not bodily qualities as the Three Jewels of Taosim are.)

In long-established Chinese traditions, the "Three Treasures" are the essential energies sustaining human life:
*''[[Jing (TCM)|Jing]]'' [[Wikt:精|精]] "nutritive essence, essence; refined, perfected; extract; spirit, sperm, seed"
*''[[Qi]]'' [[Wikt:氣|氣]] "vitality, energy, force; air, vapor; breath; spirit, vigor; attitude"
*''[[Shen (Chinese "spirit; god")|Shen]]'' [[Wikt:神|神]] "spirit; soul, mind; god, deity; supernatural being"
This ''jing-qi-shen'' ordering is more commonly used than the variants ''qi-jing-shen'' and ''shen-qi-jing''.

In ''Neidan'' "[[internal alchemy]]" practice (Despeux 2008:563), transmuting the Three Treasures is expressed through the phrases ''lianjing huaqi''  鍊精化氣 "refining essence into breath", ''lianqi huashen''  鍊氣化神 "refining breath into spirit", and ''lianshen huanxu''  鍊神還虛 "refining spirit and reverting to Emptiness". Both ''Neidan'' and [[Neo-Confucianism]] (Despeux 2008:564-5) distinguish the three between ''xiantian'' 先天 "prior to heaven" and ''houtian'' 後天 "posterior to heaven", referring to ''Yuanjing'' 元精 "Original Essence", ''[[Yuan qi|Yuanqi]]'' 元氣 "Original Breath", and ''yuanshen'' 元神 "Original Spirit".

The (2nd century BCE) ''[[Huainanzi]]'' refers to ''qi'' and ''shen'' with ''xing''  [[Wikt:形|形]] "form; shape; body".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The bodily form [''xing''] is the residence of life; the ''qi'' fills this life while ''shen'' controls it. If either of them loses their proper position, they will all come to harm. (1, tr. Englehart 2000:99) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Taoist text ''Gaoshang yuhuang xinyin jing'' (高上玉皇心印經, "Mind-Seal Scripture of the Exalted Jade Sovereign", or ''Xinyin jing'' "Mind-Seal Scripture") is a valuable early source about the Three Treasures (tr. Olson 1993). &lt;blockquote&gt;Probably dating from the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279), this anonymous text presents a simple and concise discussion of internal alchemy (''neidan'' 內丹). In particular, it emphasizes the so-called Three Treasures (''sanbao'' 三寶), namely, vital essence (''jing'' 精), subtle breath (''qi'' 氣), and spirit (''shen'' 神). (Komjathy 2004:29) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Frederic H. Balfour]]'s (1880:380-381) brief essay about the ''Xinyin jing'' ("The Imprint of the Heart") contains the earliest known Western reference to the Three Treasures: "There are three degrees of Supreme Elixir – the Spirit, the Breath, and the Essential Vigour".

The (late 16th century) ''[[Journey to the West]]'' novel provides a more recent example when an enlightened Taoist patriarch instructs [[Sun Wukong]] "Monkey" with a poem that begins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Know well this secret formula wondrous and true:
Spare and nurse the vital forces, this and nothing else.
All power resides in the semen [jing], the breath [qi], and the spirit [shen];
Guard these with care, securely, lest there be a leak.
Lest there be a leak!
Keep within the body! (tr. Yu 1977:88)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Warmiak''' are a [[Poles|Polish]] ethnic group from [[Warmia]] who are mostly [[Roman Catholic]]s and who speak their own dialect of [[Polish language|Polish]], called ''gwara warmińska'' (see: [[Dialects of the Polish language]]).

Between the 14th and 17th centuries, settlers from northern [[Mazovia]] moved to former territories of [[Old Prussians]], following conquests by the [[Teutonic Order]], and the erection of the [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights]].

The [[bishopric of Warmia]] became in 1466 an autonomous part of [[Royal Prussia]], and remained part of [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] until 1772 (see: [[Partitions of Poland]]). While [[Mazurian ethnic group|Mazurs]] in the neighboring [[Ducal Prussia]] became Protestants when that Duchy adopted [[Lutheranism]] in the 16th century, most Warmiaks, populating the areas around [[Olsztyn]], remained Catholics. 

During [[World War II]], the Warmiaks were persecuted by the [[Nazi Germany]] government, which wanted to erase all aspects of Polish culture and Polish language in [[Warmia]]. After the war, due to their Polish roots, they were not victims of [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II]], but in the course of the time, large numbers of Warmiaks decided to leave their native land and settle in more prosperous [[West Germany]].

'''Wesley Grapp''' served as head of the Los Angeles [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) office. He was the agent who carried out [[J. Edgar Hoover|Hoover]]'s orders to give FBI information to [[University of California]] senior regent [[Edwin W. Pauley]]. Pauley allegedly had a history of political connections with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), forerunner of today's CIA, as well as a close association with Will Jenkinson, who was later to serve as director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], (1953–1961).

Grapp left the FBI in 1972 and headed security for [[Flying Tigers Airlines]]. He is retired.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7176">On January 1, 2012, Witeck-Combs Communications, Inc. officially was renamed Witeck Communications, Inc. with the departure of Wesley Combs who accepted a senior management role with Accenture, and subsequently with the Boston Consulting Group. Bob Witeck remains the sole principal of the more than two-decade old independent, consulting practice based in Washington, D.C.

'''Witeck Communications, Inc.''' is a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based [[communication]]s firm that provides strategic [[public relations]] and [[marketing]] communications services for corporate and non-profit clients.  Witeck Communications specializes in the [[Gay marketing|Gay and Lesbian Consumer Market]]; health, disability and social issues; and reaching the Washington, D.C. market.  The company frequently represents Fortune 500 companies that serve the multi-billion-dollar [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] market.

== History ==
For years Bob Witeck and Wesley Combs volunteered and worked for [[LGBT rights|LGBT civil rights]] causes and [[AIDS]] benefits. They observed that these organizations often lacked the professional expertise, skills and business savvy to grow and prosper.  They saw a disconnect between the gay community and the professional world and decided to co-found Witeck-Combs Communications, Inc. as a bridge to connect these two worlds.  They believed that GLBT market visibility also was key to meaningful political and social change.

== National Coming Out Day ==
In 1993, Bob Witeck and Wesley Combs founded Witeck-Combs Communications and immediately began work on two projects that would shape their business.  The first was to shape and promote [[National Coming Out Day]] as an educational project of the [[Human Rights Campaign]].  Witeck-Combs Communications helped openly gay (and lesbian) actors [[Amanda Bearse]] and [[Dan Butler]] to communicate honestly to celebrate and promote [[National Coming Out Day]] by serving as the first celebrity spokespersons for the Human Rights Campaign Fund (since renamed the Human Rights Campaign (www.hrc.org).  In all of the posters, publicity and public appearances, Dan and Amanda helped popularize the expression, "I'm not a straight person, but I play one on TV."&lt;ref&gt;Witeck, Robert and Combs, Wesley. "Business Inside Out: Capturing Millions of Brand Loyal Consumers" Kaplan Publishing. 2006. Pages 10-13. [http://www.lambdarising.com/NASApp/store/Product;jsessionid=abcWcRC6oykBx7BT3cxgr?s=showproduct&amp;isbn=9781419505201]&lt;/ref&gt;

== American Airlines ==
The second client project that shaped Witeck-Combs Communications' reputation was their strategy in 1994 to withstand backlash and a possible LGBT consumer boycott of [[American Airlines]] and to help foster an airline employee education program that was sensitive to people living with [[HIV/AIDS]] and [[LGBT]] people. In June 1993, many LGBT Americans traveled to the March on Washington.  The controversy erupted when a member of an American Airlines' flight crew recommended that the pillows and blankets used by group of GLBT passengers be thrown away because of fears they were contaminated with [[HIV]], the virus which causes [[AIDS]][http://money.cnn.com/2006/12/06/magazines/fortune/pluggedin_Gunther_gayconsumer.fortune/index.htm 3]. 

This incident was compounded by a separate episode in 1993, when a passenger living with [[AIDS]] was removed insensitively from an [[American Airlines]] flight because the flight crew deemed the passenger much too ill to travel.&lt;ref&gt;Witeck, Robert and Combs, Wesley. "Business Inside Out: Capturing Millions of Brand Loyal Consumers" Kaplan Publishing. 2006. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Witeck-Combs Communications was hired to stem the tide of frustration and critical news coverage from the [[Gay Community]].  Witeck-Combs began by advising on employee training programs to ensure that each employee would be appropriately sensitive to LGBT customers and those living with HIV and AIDS, and to distinguish health issues from sexual orientation.  In addition, Witeck-Combs Communications went farther to counsel [[American Airlines]] on its communications strategy combined with its policies and practices to ensure they are respectful of people living HIV/AIDS as well as American's LGBT passengers and employees.  [[American Airlines]] was among the first airlines to include sexual orientation and transgender identity nondiscrimination protections into its workplace policies.  [[American Airlines]] was the first airline to implement equal partnership benefits for same-sex partners as are provided to married spouses.&lt;ref&gt;Witeck, Robert and Combs, Wesley. "Business Inside Out: Capturing Millions of Brand Loyal Consumers" Kaplan Publishing. 2006. Page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Witeck-Combs Communications continues to work with [[American Airlines]] to reach out to the [[gay market]] and to enhance American's longstanding reputation for inclusion, fairness and acceptance on all levels.

== Research ==
Witeck-Combs Communications has teamed with both [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] and Marketresearch.com to understand the minds, preferences, demographics and purchasing power of the LGBT individuals through authentic and original market research.  Such research has shown that:

* 78% of LGBT Consumers are extremely likely or very likely to consider brands that are known to provide equal workplace benefits for all their employees, including LGBT workers.&lt;ref&gt;Witeck-Combs and HPOL data 2007, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* 91% of LGBT workers choose to work for a company that offers domestic partner benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates/Witeck-Combs/Harris Interactive (2000-2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2006 buying power of the Gays and Lesbians was $660 billion and the Gay and Lesbian buying power is expected to exceed $835 billion by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;PRNewswire. "Buying Power of US Gays and Lesbians to Exceed $835 Billion by 2011." January 25th, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, American Demographics Magazine picked Witeck and Combs as two of twenty-five people in America over the past 25 years who have done the most to shape the trends, knowledge and demographics of all Americans for their work on LGBT marketing and media relations.

After thirteen years of growing LGBT market expertise, the two principals were approached in 2006 by Kaplan Publishing to share their unique lessons and experience, and to co-author the first business book on LGBT marketing entitled, "Business Inside Out:  Capturing Millions of Brand Loyal Gay Consumers."  Their friend and mentor, Allan Gilmour, former Chief Financial Officer for Ford Motor Company and an openly gay former business executive, wrote the books' foreword.

{{about|the concert on Long Island|the concert at Madison Square Garden|Woodstock '79}}

'''Woodstock Reunion 1979''' was a concert on Saturday {{date|1979-09-08}} at [[Parr Meadows]] racetrack in the hamlet of [[Yaphank, New York|Yaphank]] in the town of [[Brookhaven, New York|Brookhaven]], [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  It had an audience of about 18,000 - 40,000 (reports vary) and was organized for the 10th anniversary of the original [[Woodstock Festival]], by concert promoter Richard Nader.&lt;ref name="libn"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://libn.com/blog/2009/05/15/kominicki-i-came-upon-a-child-of-god-he-was-walking-the-lie/ | title = Kominicki: I came upon a child of God, he was walking the LIE | first = John | last = Kominicki | date = May 15, 2009 | publisher = [[Long Island Business News]] | accessdate = 2010-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was one of several Woodstock reunion events that year.

Performers included [[Paul Butterfield]] and [[Rick Danko]],&lt;ref name="libn"/&gt; [[Canned Heat]], [[Richie Havens]], [[Jorma Kaukonen]], [[Country Joe McDonald]], [[John Sebastian]], [[Michael Shrieve]], [[Stephen Stills]], [[Leslie West]], and [[Johnny Winter]].&lt;ref name="wv-stills"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/stephen-stills/concerts/parr-meadows-september-07-1979.html | title =  Stephen Stills Concert: Parr Meadows (Brookhaven, NY) | work = [[Wolfgang's Vault]] | location = [[San Francisco, California]] | accessdate = 2010-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/concerts/1975-79.html?rpp=50&amp;pg=1&amp;srt=6 | title = 1975-79 | work = [[Wolfgang's Vault]] | location = [[San Francisco, California]] | accessdate = 2010-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This reunion concert faced organizational difficulties, much like the original Woodstock, though on a far smaller scale.  On Friday the 7th, the day before the show, over 1000 young people showed up and camped out at the site; prompting complaints from neighbours.  The next day there was a delay in opening the venue gates, due to security concerns by the concert-promoter; which almost resulted in a revocation of the permit and cancellation of the show by local officials.

Recordings of the concert were broadcast on the ''[[King Biscuit Flower Hour]]''.&lt;ref name="libn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wv-stills"/&gt;  A [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] CD titled '''''Live at Parr Meadows''''' also exists.&lt;ref name="libn"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14717">'''World Inequality Report''' is a report by the World Inequality Lab at the [[Paris School of Economics]] that provides estimates of global income and wealth inequality based on the most recent findings compiled by the World Wealth and Income Database (WID). WID, also referred to as WID.world, is an open source database, that is part of an international collaborative effort of over a hundred researchers in five continents. The World Inequality Report includes discussions on potential future academic research as well as content useful for public debates and policy related to economic inequality. The first report, entitled World Inequality Report 2018, which was released on December 14, 2017 at the [[Paris School of Economics]] during the first WID.world Conference, was compiled by [[Facundo Alvaredo]], [[Lucas Chancel]], [[Thomas Piketty]],  [[Emmanuel Saez]], and [[Gabriel Zucman]] based on WID data. The 300-page report cautions that since 1980, around the globe, there has been an increase in the gap between rich and poor. In Europe, the increase in inequality increased more moderately while in North America and Asia, the increase was rapid. In the Middle East, Africa, and Brazil, income inequality did not increase but remained at very high levels.

In an interview with ''Quartz'', Piketty predicted that if the "world follows the trajectory of the US" inequality would get much worse.

==World Inequality Lab==
The  report by the World Inequality Lab at the [[Paris School of Economics]], is "based on the latest evidence collected for the World Wealth and Income Database, a massive project maintained by more than 100 researchers in more than 70 countries."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt;

Researchers worked on an international collaborative effort to extend the existing database, the World Top Incomes Database (WTID) to the World Wealth and Income Database (WID) which provides data on both distribution of income and wealth, "as well as the distribution of different forms of capital assets, in the analyzed countries".&lt;ref name="review_WID"/&gt; The WTID "generally focused on the concentration of wealth among the top decile in a given population."&lt;ref name="review_WID"&gt;{{cite journal |series=Reviews of Datasets |title=The World Wealth and Income Database (WID) |journal=Journal of World-Historical Information (JWHI)|volume= 2-3 |number=2 |year=2014-2015  |  ISSN=2169-0812 |doi=10.5195/jwhi.2015.33  |url=http://jwhi.pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WID is an "information hub" informing academic research&lt;ref&gt;Anthony B. Atkinson, Thomas Piketty, and Emmanuel Saez, "Top Incomes in the Long Run of History," Journal of Economic Literature 49, no. 1 (2011): 3-71,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Facundo Alvaredo, Anthony B Atkinson, Thomas Piketty, and Emmanuel Saez, "The Top 1 Percent in International and Historical Perspective,".

By 2015, the WID provided data series on the distribution of income and wealth in thirty-three countries mainly from the Americas and Europe. At that time there the intention was to "include data series for an additional forty countries." The first WID in 2013, which was placed in an open source repository in September 2013, was compiled by [[Facundo Alvaredo]], [[Anthony B. Atkinson]], [[Thomas Piketty]],  [[Emmanuel Saez]], and [[Gabriel Zucman]].&lt;ref name="review_WID"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WID"&gt;{{citation |title=The World Wealth and Income Database (WID) |editor-first1=Facundo |editor-last1=Alvaredo |editor-first2=Anthony B.  |editor-last2=Atkinson |editor-first3=Thomas |editor-last3=Piketty |editor-first4=Emmanuel |editor-last4=Saez |editor-first5=Gabriel |editor-last5=Zucman  |date=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2016 to 2017, through a 2015 Centers for Equitable Growth (CEG), Piketty, Saez, and Zucman studied Distributional National Accounts (DINA) for the United States. "DINA are defined as distributional statistics of pre-tax and post-tax income and wealth consistent with National Income and Product Accounts, and the Flow of Funds of the United States."&lt;ref name="review_WID"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Thomas |last1=Piketty |first2=Emmanuel |last2=Saez |first3=Gabriel |last3=Zucman |title=Summary: CEG Grant: US Distributional Accounts |url=http://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/dina-CEG.pdf |format=PDF |date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piketty, Thomas. 2014.

==World Inequality Report 2018==
In 2018 Facundo Alvaredo, Lucas Chancel, Thomas Piketty,  Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel Zucmanon compiled the first report, the "World Inequality Report 2018"&lt;ref name="WIR_2018"&gt;{{cite report |title=World Inequality Report (2018) |editor-first1=Facundo |editor-last1=Alvaredo |editor-first2=Lucas   |editor-last2=Chancel|editor-first3=Thomas |editor-last3=Piketty |editor-first4=Emmanuel |editor-last4=Saez |editor-first5=Gabriel |editor-last5=Zucman  |url=http://wir2018.wid.world/files/download/wir2018-full-report-english.pdf |format=PDF |date=December 14, 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017 |pages=300}} "This report emphasizes recent research articles written by: Facundo Alvaredo Lydia Assouad Anthony B. Atkinson Charlotte Bartels Thomas Blanchet Lucas Chancel Luis Estévez-Bauluz Juliette Fournier Bertrand Garbinti Jonathan Goupille-Lebret Clara Martinez-Toledano Salvatore Morelli Marc Morgan Delphine Nougayrède Filip Novokmet Thomas Piketty Emmanuel Saez Li Yang Gabriel Zucman"&lt;/ref&gt; which was released on December 14, 2017 at the [[Paris School of Economics]] during the first WID.world Conference.

==Highlights of the World Inequality Report 2018==
The five part 300-page report discusses "the WID.world project and the measurement of economic inequality in Part I, trends in global income inequality in Part II, public versus private capital dynamics in Part III, trends in global wealth inequality in Part IV , tackling Economic Inequality in [http://wir2018.wid.world/files/download/wir2018-full-report-english.pdf#250 Part V]. Methodological "details on how estimations were constructed are available at the report's website".&lt;ref&gt;[wir2018.wid.world Dedicated website for World Inequality Report 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', "Policy, it turns out, matters. More aggressive redistribution through taxes and transfers has spared Europe from the acute disparities that Americans have grown used to. Unequal access to education is helping reproduce inequality in the United States down the generations."&lt;ref name="NYT_Porter_WIR_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WIR_2018"/&gt;{{rp|10,16}} The ''Times'' article also noted that, "China's strategy based on low-skill manufacturing for export, and underpinned by aggressive investment in infrastructure, has proven more effective at raising living standards for the bottom half of the population than India's more inward-looking strategy, which has limited the benefits of globalization to the well-educated elite."&lt;ref name="NYT_Porter_WIR_2018"/&gt; Tetlow of the ''Financial Times'' described inequality as the "defining characteristic of the age" as [[The rich get richer and the poor get poorer]].&lt;ref name="FT_London_Tetlow"/&gt; The ''India Times'' article drew attention to the way in which "[d]eregulation and opening-up reforms in India since 1980s have led to substantial increase in inequality so much that top 0.1% of earners has continued to capture more growth than all those in the bottom 50% combined."&lt;ref name="indiatimes_WIR_2017"/&gt; The WIR reported that, "Income inequality in India has reached historically high levels. In 2014, the share of national income accruing to India's top 1% of earners was 22%, while the share of the top 10% was around 56%."&lt;ref name="WIR_2018"/&gt;{{rp|123}}

''Quartz'' cited the report, "[S]ince 1980 the top 0.1% have captured as much income growth as the entire bottom half of world's (adult) population. And for the group of people in between the bottom 50% and top 1%—mostly the lower- and middle-income groups in North America and Europe—income growth has been either sluggish or flat."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt; The WIR 2018 shows that, "The gap between rich and poor has increased in nearly every region in the world over the past few decades."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt; Since "1980, income inequality has increased rapidly in North America and Asia, increased more moderately in Europe, and stabilized at very high levels in the Middle East, Africa, and Brazil."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt;

==First WID.world conference==
The conference held on December 14 and December 15, was sponsored by the Paris School of Economics, the [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]], the Washington Center for Equitable Growth (CEG), the [[Ford Foundation]], and the [[European Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wid.world/news-article/first-wid-world-conference-program-available/ |title=First WID.world Conference |date=December 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017 |work=WID}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of the first issue of the World Inequality Report #wir2018 on Thursday 14th (9.30 am – 1 pm). The executive committee of the conference included Alvaredo, Chancel, Piketty, Saez, Zucman, the WID.world and the World Inequality Lab Executive Committee. The program included the release of the report that would "provide global estimates of income and wealth inequality drawing on the latest evidence gathered in WID.world" [and ] "discuss implications for future research and the global policy debate on rising inequality". There was a session honoring Tony Atkinson and presentations of "research papers on income and wealth inequality" and "on the DINA-Distributional National Accounts agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/news/save-the-date-release-of-the-world-inequality-report-2018-14-december-2017/ |title=(save the date) Release of the World Inequality Report 2018 - 14 December 2017 |date=December 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017 |work=WID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report finds that the richest 1 percent of humanity reaped 27 percent of the world's income between 1980 and 2016. The bottom 50 percent, by contrast, got only 12 percent."}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref name="theguardian_Neate_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/dec/14/world-richest-increased-wealth-same-amount-as-poorest-half |title=World's richest 0.1% have boosted their wealth by as much as poorest half |quote=Inequality report also shows UK's 50,000 richest people have seen their share of the country's wealth double since 1984 |first=Rupert |last=Neate |date=December 14, 2017 |access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Quartz]]'',&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://qz.com/1155448/thomas-piketty-says-the-us-is-setting-a-bad-example-on-inequality-for-the-world/ |title=Thomas Piketty says the US is setting a bad example on inequality for the world |first=Eshe |last=Nelson |date=December 14, 2017 |access-date=December 16, 2017 |publisher=Quartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Financial Times]]'',&lt;ref name="FT_London_Tetlow"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/7b1c080c-e026-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce |newspaper=Financial Times |date=December 13, 2017 |access-date=December 16, 2017 |title=Is the world becoming more unequal? |first=Gemma |last=Tetlow |location=London, UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''India Times'',&lt;ref name="indiatimes_WIR_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/indian-economic-inequality-widened-since-1980-report/articleshow/62070475.cms |title=Indian economic inequality widened since 1980: Report |author=ET Bureau |newspaper=India Times |date=December 14, 2017  |access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Associated Press]] via [[ABC News]].&lt;ref name="ABC_AP_Kurtenbach"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/report-rich-richer-world-inequality-grows-51806278 |title=Report: Rich will get still richer unless policies change |first1=Elaine |last1=Kurtenbach |first2=Christopher |last2=Rugaber |work=ABC News via AP |location=Tokyo |date=December 15, 2017 |access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the interview with ''Quartz'', Piketty warned of the impediments to getting "a comprehensive picture of wealth", such as [[tax havens]]. Piketty observed that "there are financial and political forces that have a vested interest in keeping this information secret," noting the "paradox of today's globalized economy" where "we are supposed to be in the era of big data and transparency, and we see that we still don't have access to all the data sources we would need."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt;
