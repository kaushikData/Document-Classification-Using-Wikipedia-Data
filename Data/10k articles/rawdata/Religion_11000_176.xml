[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Rape of the Daughters of Leucippus - WGA20299.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Rape of the Daughters of Leucippus by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. [[Alte Pinakothek]]]]

The name of the temple derives from the Greek {{lang|grc|Ἄνακες}} (an archaic form of {{lang|grc|[[Anax|ἄνακτες]]}}, "lords" or "kings"), the title by which the Dioskouroi, Castor and Pollux, twin sons of [[Zeus]] and [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], were commonly known in [[Attica]].&lt;ref name=OCD&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Classical Dictionary|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198606419|edition=3|editor=Hornblower, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|80&amp;ndash;81}}

The Old Agora, the predecessor of the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Classical Agora]], was used in the fifth century and before as a rallying point, and references in [[Andocides|Andokides]] and [[Thucydides]] to musters at the Anakeion in 415 and 411 BCE have led scholars to conclude that the Anakeion may have lain within the vicinity of the Old Agora, perhaps to the east of the Acropolis.&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Noel|title=The City Center of Archaic Athens|journal=Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens|date=Jul–Sep 1998|volume=67|issue=3|pages=283&amp;ndash;302|jstor=2668475}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|295&amp;ndash;297}}{{refn|group="nb"|The position of the Old Agora is disputed, and it may instead have lain north or north-east of the Acropolis.&lt;ref name=Robertson /&gt;{{RP|287&amp;ndash;286}}}}

== Decoration ==

The decoration of the Anakeion, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], fell to [[Micon|Mikon]] and [[Polygnotos]]. The former depicted the [[Argonauts]], the followers of [[Jason]], with particular attention to [[Acastus|Akastos]] and his horses. Polygnotos depicted the ''Rape of the Leukippides'': the forcible abduction and marriage of [[Phoebe (Leucippides)|Phoebe]] and [[Hilaeira]], daughters of [[Leucippus (mythology)|Leukippos]], by the Dioskouroi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=W.

In Hinduism, the '''''Ananta Samhita''''' is a recently created scripture, authored by Ananta Vasudeva, a disciple of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur, founder of the Gaudiya Math. It is supposed to be a [[Pancaratra]] [[Hindu Agamas|agama]], part of the Pancaratra corpus known collectively as the "[[Narada]] Pancaratra" among [[Gaudiya Vaisnava]]s. Please see https://gosai.com/writings/greater-than-the-upanisads-and-the-vedas where Srila Sridhara deva Goswami of Sarasvata Gaudiya Math confirms this book was written by his godbrother Ananta Vasudeva.

==Early phase==
In 1916-1917 `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] asking the followers of the religion to travel to regions of [[Africa]]; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].&lt;ref name="tablets"&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-7.html.iso8859-1?#gr5| pages = 40–2, 57 86 |origyear = 1916-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The publication was delayed until 1919 in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919 after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth==
In 1956, the western African region with about 1000 Bahá'ís&lt;ref name="xviii"/&gt; was organized into the regional National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of North-West Africa including Tunisia, Algeria, the various Moroccos and Cameroons, Togolands, the Gold Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Madeira, the Canary Island, Cape Verde Islands, and St. Thomas Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = "Country notes" on Africa | work = Asia Pacific Bahá'í Studies | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | url =http://bahai-library.com/asia-pacific/country%20files/africa.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time the Bahá'ís in Liberia had an endowment or a national center in Bomi Hills&lt;ref name="xviii"/&gt;  By the end of 1963 there were assemblies in Bomi Hills, [[Harper City]], [[Pleebo]], [[Gboweta]], and Monrovia. There were smaller groups of Bahá'ís in the a district of [[Gbarnga]], [[Mano River]] Camp and [[Totota]]. Individual Bahá'ís lived in [[Belefania]], [[Gbarma]], another district of [[Gbarnga]], [[Harbel]], [[Kakata]], [[Knowoke]], [[Lazamai]], [[Soboreke]], [[Suakoko]], and districts of [[Webbo]].&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; In 1967, the Bahá'í marriage ceremony was accepted in Liberia.&lt;ref name="rid"&gt;{{cite web | title = Ridvan 1967 | work = Published Documents from the Universal House of Justice | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | date = April 1967 | url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ridvan_1967 | doi = | accessdate = 2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Enoch Olinga]] also had a large influence on growth of the community including witnessing the first election of the National Spiritual Assembly in 1975.&lt;ref name="xviii"/&gt;

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. While Liberia was still in civil war Bahá'ís continued to be active in and near Liberia.

===Bahá'í Academy===
In 2004, Kathleen Underwood returned to serve as principal of the K-12 Bahá'í Academy,&lt;ref name="tandd"/&gt; which was on the verge of closing. It was broke, needed to repair the roof and didn't have the means necessary to secure a license from the ministry of education have no textbooks relying solely on their instructors for information. Near the end of their studies, students must pass the West African Senior School Certificate Examination ([[WASSCE]]) which is administered by the [[West African Examinations Council]]. Each day the students participate in Formation, which includes the raising of the Liberian Flag, morning prayer and the recitation of the pledge to their flag.

===Demographics===
A small percentage of the Liberian population is [[Bahá'í]], [[Hindu]], [[Sikh]], [[Buddhist]], or [[atheist]].&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7617">'''Beth-Anath''' was  mentioned in the [[Bible]] [[Book of Joshua]] ({{Bibleverse||Joshua|19:38|HE}}) and the [[Book of Judges]] ({{Bibleverse||Judges|1:33|HE}}) as a land given to [[Naphtali]].

==Early history==
The [[Zenon Papyri]] (mid 3rd-century BCE) mentions a certain estate belonging to Apollonius in '''Βαιτανατα''' (= ''Beth-anath''), a way-stop along the route traveled by the Zenon party as it passed through ancient Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Pastor, ''Land and Economy in Ancient Palestine'', London 2013, note [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=AGeHDna_9dwC&amp;pg=PT40&amp;lpg=PT40&amp;dq=Beth+Anath+in+the+Zenon+Papyri&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j_xxzOVtqc&amp;sig=lSDUx64hGQiyOY1uZIDvH4W84iM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTwrLZrcjdAhXECCwKHbB2CigQ6AEwAHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 47].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G. Wilson &amp; Michel Desjardins, ''Text and Artifact in the Religions of Mediterranean Antiquity: Essays in honour of Peter Richardson'', Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, Waterloo Ontario 2000, p. [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=IvqJMNQfdrkC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=Beth+Anath+in+the+Zenon+Papyri&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fdqTELa_q3&amp;sig=gwZrAvG2u895nBaMjJIzfwgIn3A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTwrLZrcjdAhXECCwKHbB2CigQ6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 121], {{ISBN|0-88920-356-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd-century CE, Beth-Anath was considered a borderline village,  inhabited by both Jews and Gentiles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tosefta]] (''Kila'im'' 2:16)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification == 
Several places have been identified with Beth-Anath.

=== Ain Aata ===
[[Ain Aata]] in Lebanon was suggested by [[Charles William Meredith van de Velde]] and [[Victor Guérin]] (1880:374) to be the ancient site of Beth-Anath. The same view was held by historical geographer Georg Kampffmeyer (1892).

=== Bi'ina ===
[[Bi'ina]] in the [[Beit HaKerem Valley]] which divides [[Upper Galilee]] from the [[Lower Galilee]] was suggested by [[Ze'ev Safrai]].&lt;ref&gt;Safrai, 1985, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Safrai &amp; Safrai, 1976, pp. 18–34&lt;/ref&gt; This view is accepted by a host of archaeologists and historical geographers: [[W.F. Albright]], (1923); [[Adolf Neubauer|Neubauer]] (1868:[https://archive.org/details/lagographiedutal00neub/page/235/mode/1up  235]–ff.); [[Félix-Marie Abel|Abel]] (1928, pp.&amp;nbsp;409–415; 1938: 266); [[Albrecht Alt|Alt]] (''PJB'' 22, 1926, pp.&amp;nbsp;55–ff.; 24, 1928, p.&amp;nbsp;87); [[:fi:Aapeli Saarisalo|Saarisalo]] ("Boundary", p.&amp;nbsp;189); Rafael Frankel, ''et al.'' (2001:136); Aviam (2004:53).

=== Safed el-Battikh ===
[[Yohanan Aharoni|Aharoni]] (1957:70-74) held the view that Beth-Anath was to be identified with ''[[Safed el-Battikh]]'', in the [[Bint Jbeil District]]. Aharoni cites [[Eusebius]]' ''[[Onomasticon (Eusebius)|Onomasticon]]'' and his mention of ''Batanaia'' being distant 15 miles from Caesarea, a place thought by Aharoni to refer to [[Cesarea Philippi]] (1957:73). According to him, this would put ''Batanaia'' (=Beth-Anath) in the vicinity of ''Safed el-Battikh''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |contribution= |title= The Anchor Bible Dictionary|editor-last1=Freedman |editor-first1=David Noel |editor-last2= |editor-first2=  |editor-link= David Noel Freedman|volume= 1 |publisher= |place =New York|page=681 (s.v. Beth-Anath) |year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hinah ===
Historical geographer [[Samuel Klein (scholar)|Samuel Klein]] (1934:18–34 ) placed Beth-Anath in [[Hinah]], a town on the southeast side of [[Mount Hermon]]. His view is supported by Grintz (1964:67), who cites [[Josephus]] (''Antiquities'' 5.1.22) as corroborating Klein's view, insofar that [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali's territory]] is said to have extended as far as [[Damascus]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |contribution= |title= The Anchor Bible Dictionary|editor-last1=Freedman |editor-first1=David Noel |editor-last2= |editor-first2=  |editor-link= David Noel Freedman|volume= 1 |publisher= |place =New York|page=680 (s.v.

C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], founder-[[acharya]] of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON). The BBT is the publisher for his books and for books by other authors. It also publishes the magazine ''[[Back to Godhead]]'' in English, [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and other languages. The BBT is a [[nonprofit organization]], independent of ISKCON, and supplies books both to ISKCON and to the book trade in general.

==Publishing range==

BBT books range in complexity from brief, introductory volumes and study guides, summary studies, biographical material &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Dasa Goswami | last = Satsvarupa| title =Srila Prabhupada Lilamrta Vol 1-2| publisher = BBT| origyear=1980-82 |year=2002 | pages = vol.1 1133 pages vol.2 1191 pages | isbn = 978-0-89213-357-4 | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt; and short Sanskrit works all the way up to exhaustive multi-volume translations (with commentaries) of major Sanskrit and Bengali works. Its publications include original scriptural works, translated into more than 80 languages, and books that discuss and explain these traditional texts. The BBT also publishes audio books, audio CDs, video materials, and multimedia presentations.

The BBT publishes the ''[[Bhagavad Gita As It Is|Bhagavad Gita]], [[Bhagavata purana|Srimad-Bhagavatam]], [[Isha Upanishad|Isopanishad]], [[Narada Bhakti Sutra]],'' and (from the Gaudiya devotional tradition) the ''Sri [[Chaitanya Charitamrita]],'' and numerous other books. Its latest multi-volume publication is an English translation, with commentary, of [[Sanatana Goswami]]'s ''[[Brihad Bhagavatamrita]].''

The BBT publishes in all the major Eastern and Western European languages, in the major Indian languages, in the main languages of the former Soviet Union, and in  Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Singhalese, Hebrew, Persian, and other languages.

Apart from the BBT's work in publishing, it helps finance the construction and renovation of Krishna temples—for example, in the most important Gaudiya Vaishnava holy places like [[Vrindavan]] and [[Mayapur]].

==Structure==
The BBT has six main publishing divisions: North European, North American, Western Pacific, Mediterranean, African, and Indian. Every division is headed by a trustee, each responsible for publishing in the languages specific to that division. The trustees meet twice a year.

'''Buddhism and violence''' refers to acts of violence and aggression committed by [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] with religious, political, or socio-cultural motivations, as well as self-inflicted violence by ascetics or for religious purposes.{{sfn|Barbaro|2010|pp=120-121}} Buddhism is generally seen as among the religious traditions least associated with violence.{{sfn|Jerryson|Juergensmeyer|2010|pp=22}} However, in the history of Buddhism, there have been acts of violence directed, promoted, or inspired by Buddhists.{{sfn|Jerryson|Juergensmeyer|2010|pp=24}} As far as Buddha's teachings and scriptures are concerned, Buddhism forbids violence for resolving conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/war.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Buddhism: War|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on teachings attributed to [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Buddhism "Buddhism"]. (2009). In ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Retrieved November 26, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library Edition&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ahimsa]], a term meaning 'not to injure', is a primary virtue in Buddhism.{{sfn|Baroni|2002|pp=3}}

''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]]'' is the earliest and most common term used to describe the goal of the Buddhist path and the ultimate eradication of [[dukkha]]—nature of life that innately includes "suffering", "pain" or "unsatisfactoriness".{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|pp=589}} Violent actions and thoughts, actions which harm and debase others and thoughts which contemplate the same, stand in the way of spiritual growth and the self-conquest which leads to the goal of existence and they are normally deemed unskilled (akusala) and cannot lead to the goal of Nirvana. Buddha condemned killing or harming living beings and encouraged reflection or mindfulness ([[satipatthana]]) as right action (or conduct), therefore "the rightness or wrongness of an action centers around whether the action itself would bring about harm to self and/or others". In the Ambalatthika-Rahulovada Sutta, the Buddha says to [[Rahula]]:

{{Quote|If you, Rahula, are desirous of doing a deed with the body, you should reflect on the deed with the body, thus: That deed which I am desirous of doing with the body is a deed of the body that might conduce to the harm of self and that might conduce to the harm of others and that might conduce to the harm of both; this deed of body is unskilled (akusala), its yield is anguish, its result is anguish.{{sfn|Harris|1994}}{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|pp=105–106}}{{sfn|Brannigan|2010|pp=59}}}}

The right action or right conduct (''samyak-karmānta'' / ''sammā-kammanta'') is the fourth aspect of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and it said that the practitioner should train oneself to be morally upright in one's activities, not acting in ways that would be corrupt or bring harm to oneself or to others. In the [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese]] and [[Pali Canon]], it is explained as:

{{quote|And what is right action? Abstaining from [[murder|taking life]], from [[stealing]], and from illicit [[sex]] [or sexual misconduct]. This is called right action.|Saccavibhanga Sutta{{sfn|Bhikkhu|1996}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu|2005}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu|2008}}&lt;ref name="cbeta.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |title=Madhyama Agama, Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 26, sutra 31 (分別聖諦經第十一) |accessdate=28 October 2008 |publisher=Cbeta |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122103247/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |archivedate=22 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taisho Tripitaka Vol Page 814"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm|title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 32, Page 814|accessdate=27 October 2008|publisher=Cbeta|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122092756/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm|archivedate=22 November 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Clayton|2006|pp=75}}{{sfn|Markham|Lohr|2009|pp=95}}{{sfn|Bodhi|2010|pp=48-58}}}}

For the lay follower, the ''Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta'' elaborates:

{{quote|And how is one made pure in three ways by bodily action? There is the case where a certain person, abandoning the taking of life, abstains from the taking of life. He dwells with his... knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given. He does not take, in the manner of a thief, things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them.{{sfn|Bhikkhu|1997}}{{sfn|Tripāṭhī|2008|pp=137}}{{sfn|Gnanananda Thero|Jayasinghe|2002|pp=57}}}}

''Sarambha'' can be translated as "accompanied by violence". As the mind filled with lobha, dosa and moha (lust, hatred and delusion) is led to actions which are akusala. Indulging in violence is a form of self-harming.{{sfn|Harris|1994}} The rejection of violence in society is recognized in Buddhism as a prerequisite for the spiritual progress of society's members, because violence brings pain to beings with similar feelings to oneself. The Buddha is quoted in the [[Dhammapada]] as saying, "All are afraid of the stick, all hold their lives dear. Putting oneself in another's place, one should not beat or kill others".{{sfn|Harris|1994}}{{sfn|Neusner|Chilton|Tully|2013|pp=181}}{{sfn|Chitkara|1999|pp=166}} [[Mettā|Metta]] (loving kindness), the development of mindstates of limitless good-will for all beings, and karuna, [[compassion]] that arises when you see someone suffering of the human being, are attitudes said to be excellent or sublime because they are the right or ideal way of conduct towards living beings (sattesu samma patipatti).{{sfn|Thera|1994}} The [[Sutta Nipata]] says "'As I am, so are these. As are these, so am I.' Drawing the parallel to yourself, neither kill nor get others to kill."{{sfn|Harris|1994}}{{sfn|Fausböll|1881|pp=29}}{{sfn|Reat|1994|pp=40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sutta Nipata 705|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/quotes/sutta-nipata-705|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|publisher=[[Georgetown University]]|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhism, to take [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] in the [[Dharma]]—one of the [[Three Jewels]]—one should not harm other [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]]. The [[Nirvana Sutra]] states, "By taking refuge in the precious Dharma, One's minds should be free from hurting or harming others".{{sfn|Gampopa|Gyaltsen Rinpoche|1998|pp=143}} One of the [[Five Precepts]] of Buddhist ethics or [[śīla]] states, "I undertake the training rule to abstain from killing."{{sfn|Clayton|2006|pp=75}}{{sfn|Sumedho|2014|pp=249-250}}{{sfn|Zaun|2002|pp=9}}{{sfn|Knaster|2010|pp=64}} The Buddha reportedly stated, "Victory breeds hatred. The defeated live in pain. Happily the peaceful live giving up victory and defeat."{{sfn|Thera|2006|pp=129}}{{sfn|Mishra|2010|pp=291}} These elements are used to indicate Buddhism is pacifistic and all violence done by Buddhists, even [[Bhikkhu|monks]], is likely due to economic or political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/budethics.htm|title=Buddhist Ethics|publisher=buddhanet|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of right speech (''samyag-vāc'' / ''sammā-vācā'') in the Noble Eightfold Path, condemn all speech that is in any way harmful (malicious and harsh speech) and divisive, encouraging to speak in thoughtful and helpful ways. The [[Pali Canon]] explained:
{{quote|And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, from divisive speech, from abusive speech, and from idle chatter: This is called right speech.{{sfn|Bhikkhu|2005}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu|2008}}&lt;ref name="cbeta.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taisho Tripitaka Vol Page 814"/&gt;{{sfn|Markham|Lohr|2009|pp=95}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu|1996}}{{sfn|Bodhi|2010|pp=48-58}}{{sfn|Gowans|2004|pp=176}}}}

[[Michael Jerryson]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaeljerryson.com Michael Jerryson] Retrieved 4 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Ohio's [[Youngstown State University]] and co-editor of the book ''Buddhist Warfare'', said that "Buddhism differs in that the act of killing is less the focus than the 'intention' behind the killing" and "The first thing to remember is that people have a penchant for violence, it just so happens that every religion has people in it."{{sfn|Shadbolt|2013}}

[[Gananath Obeyesekere]], Emeritus Professor of [[Anthropology]] at [[Princeton University]], said that "in the Buddhist doctrinal tradition... there is little evidence of intolerance, no justification for violence, no conception even of 'just wars' or 'holy wars.' ... one can make an assertion that Buddhist doctrine is impossible to reconcile logically with an ideology of violence and intolerance"{{sfn|Neusner|Chilton|Tully|2013|pp=181}}

There is however in Buddhism a long tradition of self-inflicted violence and death, as a form of asceticism or protest,{{sfn|Barbaro|2010|pp=120-121}} as exemplified by the use of fires and burns to show determinations among Chinese monks or by the self-immolations of monks such as [[Thích Quảng Đức]] during the Vietnam war.

==Regional examples==

===Southeast Asia===
====Thailand====

{{See also|Buddhism in Thailand}}
In [[Southeast Asia]], [[Thailand]] has had several prominent virulent Buddhist monastic calls for violence. In the 1970s, nationalist Buddhist monks like Phra Kittiwuttho argued that killing Communists did not violate any of the Buddhist precepts.{{sfn|Jerryson|2011|pp=110}} The militant side of [[Thai Buddhism]] became prominent again in 2004 when a Malay Muslim insurgency renewed in Thailand's deep south. At first Buddhist monks ignored the conflict as they viewed it as political and not religious but eventually they adopted an "identity-formation", as practical realities require deviations from religious ideals.{{sfn|Jerryson|2011|pp=182-186}}

====Myanmar====

{{main|2013 Burma anti-Muslim riots}}
{{See also|Buddhism in Myanmar}}
{{See also|Human rights in Myanmar}}
In recent years the [[State Peace and Development Council]] (SPDC), the [[military regime]] of [[Burma]] from 1988 to 2011, had strongly encouraged the conversion of ethnic minorities, often by force, as part of its campaign of assimilation. The regime promoted a vision of Burmese Buddhist nationalism as a cultural and a political ideology to legitimise its contested rule, trying to bring a religious syncretism between Buddhism and its [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] ideology.{{sfn|Skidmore|2005|pp=120}}

The [[Saffron Revolution]], a series of economic and political protests and demonstrations that took place during 2007, were led by students, political activists, including women, and Buddhist monks and took the form of a campaign of [[nonviolent resistance]], sometimes also called [[civil resistance]].{{sfn|Roberts|Garton Ash|2011|pp=354-370}}

In response to the protests dozens of protesters were arrested or detained. Starting in September 2007 the protests were led by thousands of Buddhist monks, and those protests were allowed to proceed until a renewed government crackdown in late September 2007.&lt;ref name="Monks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2007/09/200852512370678540.html|title=UN envoy warns of Myanmar crisis|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 184 protesters were shot and killed and many were tortured. Under the SPDC, the [[Tatmadaw|Burmese army]] engaged in military offensives against ethnic minority populations, committing acts that violated [[international humanitarian law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elaine Pearson |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/07/burma19564.htm |title=Burma: No Rights Reform 20 Years After Massacre &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Jerryson, author of several books heavily critical of Buddhism's traditional peaceful perceptions, stated that, "The Burmese Buddhist monks may not have initiated the violence but they rode the wave and began to incite more. While the ideals of Buddhist canonical texts promote peace and pacifism, discrepancies between reality and precepts easily flourish in times of social, political and economic insecurity, such as Myanmar's current transition to democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=How to reverse Buddhism’s radical turn in Southeast Asia? | work=IRIN | date=16 July 2013 | url=http://www.irinnews.org/analysis/2013/07/16/how-reverse-buddhism%E2%80%99s-radical-turn-southeast-asia | access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However several Buddhist leaders including [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]], [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], [[Shodo Harada]] and the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] among others condemned the violence against Muslims in Myanmar and called for peace, supporting the practice of the fundamental Buddhist principles of non-harming, mutual respect and compassion. The Dalai Lama said "Buddha always teaches us about forgiveness, tolerance, compassion. If from one corner of your mind, some emotion makes you want to hit, or want to kill, then please remember Buddha's faith. We are followers of Buddha." He said that "All problems must be solved through dialogue, through talk.

When Duthagamani laments over the thousands he has killed, the eight [[arhat]]s (Buddha's enlightened disciples) who come to console him reply that no real sin has been committed by him because he has only killed Tamil unbelievers who are no better than beasts, then go on to say: "thou wilt bring glory to the doctrine of the Buddha in manifold ways; therefore cast away care from the heart, O ruler of men".{{sfn|DeVotta|2007|pp=7-8}}{{sfn|Deegale|2006|pp=153}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chapter XXV THE VICTORY OF DUTTHAGAMANI|url = http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap025.html|website = lakdiva.org|access-date = 2016-02-20|quote = "`From this deed arises no hindrance in thy way to heaven.

But as for thee, thou wilt bring glory to the doctrine of the Buddha in manifold ways; therefore cast away care from thy heart, O ruler of men!'"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutthagamani's campaign against king Elara was not to defeat injustice, as the Mahavamsa describes Elara as a good ruler, but to restore Buddhism through a united Sri Lanka under a Buddhist monarch, even by the use of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Buddhism and Ethnic Conflict in Sri Lanka|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9XYNBQzYoYkC|publisher = SUNY Press|date = 2009-01-05|isbn = 9780791493670|language = en|first = Patrick|last = Grant|quote = "The campaign against Elara is described at some length in the Mahavamsa, and it is clear that Dutthagamini does not move against Elara because the Tamil king was unjust, cruel, or tyrannical.

In constructing the "Dutthagamini epic" as he does, Mahanama wants to make clear that the heroic task in hand is not the defeat of injustice but the restoration of Buddhism. The overthrow of the Tamil king is required first and foremost because Sri Lanka cannot be united unless the monarch is Buddhist. [...] The main point is the honor Dutthagamini brings "to the doctrine of the Buddha," and this greater good justifies the violence required to bring it about. [...] Mahanama's [author of the Mahavamsa] lesson for monarchs remains consistent: be as strong as you need to be to maintain the Buddhist state; be supportive of the Sangha and willing to defeat the enemy by force."|pages = 48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahavamsa story about Buddha's visit to Sri Lanka where he (referred to as the "Conqueror") subdues forces inimical to Buddhism, the [[Yakkhas]] (depicted as the non-human inhabitants of the island), by striking "terror to their hearts" and driving them from their homeland, so that his doctrine should eventually "shine in glory", has been described as providing the warrant for the use of violence for the sake of Buddhism and as an account that is in keeping with the general message of the author that the political unity of Sri Lanka under Buddhism requires the removal of uncooperative groups.{{sfn|Bartholomeusz|2005|pp=50}}

According to Neil DeVotta (an Associate Professor of Political Science), the mytho-history described in the Mahavamsa "justifies dehumanizing non-Sinhalese, if doing so is necessary to preserve, protect, and propagate the [[Dharma|dhamma]] (Buddhist doctrine). Furthermore, it legitimizes a [[Just War Doctrine|just war doctrine]], provided that war is waged to protect Buddhism. Together with the [[Prince Vijaya|Vijaya myth]], it introduces the bases for the Sinhalese Buddhist belief that Lord Buddha designated the island of Sri Lanka as a repository for [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]. It claims the Sinhalese were the first humans to inhabit the island (as those who predated the Sinhalese were subhuman) and are thus the true "sons of the soil". Additionally, it institutes the belief that the island's kings were beholden to protect and foster Buddhism. All of these legacies have had ramifications for the trajectory of political Buddhism and Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism."{{sfn|DeVotta|2007|pp=8}}

=====Rise of modern Sinhalese-Buddhist nationalism=====
With the rise of modern Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as a reaction to the changes brought under the [[British Ceylon|British colonialism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Path to Salvation: Religious Violence from the Crusades to Jihad|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fMvQAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Potomac Books, Inc.|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 9781612346618|language = en|first = Heather Selma|last = Gregg|page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; the old religious mytho-history of the Mahavamsa (especially the emphasis on the Sinhalese and Tamil ethnicities of Duthagamani and Elara, respectively{{sfn|DeVotta|2007|pp=7}}) was revitalized and consequently would prove to be detrimental to the intergroup harmony in the island. As Heather Selma Gregg writes: "Modern-day Sinhalese nationalism, rooted in local myths of being a religiously chosen people and of special progeny, demonstrates that even a religion perceived as inherently peaceful can help fuel violence and hatred in its name."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Path to Salvation: Religious Violence from the Crusades to Jihad|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fMvQAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Potomac Books, Inc.|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 9781612346618|language = en|first = Heather Selma|last = Gregg|page = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist revivalism took place among the Sinhalese to counter Christian missionary influence. The British commissioned the [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] translation of the Mahavamsa (which was originally written in [[Pali]]), thereby making it accessible to the wider Sinhalese population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sri Lanka: War-torn Island|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8zpuAAAAMAAJ|publisher = Lerner Publications|date = 1998-01-01|isbn = 9780822535508|language = en|first = Lawrence J.|last = Zwier|quote = "Because the Mahavamsa was written in Pali, few Sinhalese could read it until its translation.

The central figure in the formation of modern Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism was the Buddhist revivalist [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] (1864–1933), who has been described as "the father of modern Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism".{{sfn|DeVotta|2007|pp=14}} Dharmapala was hostile to all things un-Sinhalese and non-Buddhist. He insisted that the Sinhalese were racially pure and superior [[Aryan race|Aryans]] while the [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] Tamils were inferior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangam.org/2010/11/Tamil_Struggle_14.php?print=true|title=Sri Lankan Tamil Struggle|publisher=Sangam|work=Association of Tamils of Sri Lanka in the USA|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/2008/06/08/features13.html|title=Racial myths debunked|publisher=The Island|first=Kumari|last=Jayawardena|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized the impression that Tamils and Sinhalese had been deadly enemies in Sri Lanka for nearly 2,000 years by quoting the Mahavamsa passages that depicted Tamils as pagan invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sri Lanka: War-torn Island|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8zpuAAAAMAAJ|publisher = Lerner Publications|date = 1998-01-01|isbn = 9780822535508|language = en|first = Lawrence J.|last = Zwier|quote = "Perhaps more than any other person, Dharmapala was responsible for popularizing the faulty impression that Tamils and Sinhalese had been deadly enemies in Sri Lanka for nearly 2,000 years.

Much of his preaching and writing was racist.

He contrasted the Sinhalese racial line with that of the Dravidian Tamils, which he claimed was inferior."}}&lt;/ref&gt; He characterized the Tamils as "fiercely antagonistic to Buddhism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Buddhism and Ethnic Conflict in Sri Lanka|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9XYNBQzYoYkC|publisher = SUNY Press|date = 2009-01-05|isbn = 9780791493670|language = en|first = Patrick|last = Grant|page = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also expressed intolerance toward the island's [[Sri Lankan Moors|Muslim minorities]] and other religions in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Buddhism and Ethnic Conflict in Sri Lanka|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9XYNBQzYoYkC|publisher = SUNY Press|date = 2009-01-05|isbn = 9780791493670|language = en|first = Patrick|last = Grant|quote = Dharmapala holds firm to the conviction that "the founders of monotheistic religions have been invariably bloodthirsty, despotic, and cruel" (418), and he is unremitting in his condemnation of the religious views of Jews, Christians, and Muslims.

Muslims are "alien to the Sinhalese by religion, race and language," and, consequently, "there will always be bad blood" (541) between the two groups.|pages = 70–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmapala also fostered Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism in the spirit of the King Dutthagamani who "rescued Buddhism and our nationalism from oblivion" and stated explicitly that the Island belongs to the Sinhalese Buddhists.{{sfn|Deegale|2006|pp=91-92}} Dharmapala has been blamed for laying the groundwork for subsequent Sinhalese Buddhists nationalists to create an [[Ethnocracy|ethnocentric state]]{{sfn|DeVotta|2007|pp=16}} and for hostility to be directed against minorities unwilling to accept such a state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Buddhism and Ethnic Conflict in Sri Lanka|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9XYNBQzYoYkC|publisher = SUNY Press|date = 2009-01-05|isbn = 9780791493670|language = en|first = Patrick|last = Grant|page = 77|quote = "One result of Dharmapala's commitment to this all-too clear agenda is that he prepares the way for indignation and anger to be directed against any non-Sinhala group unwilling to accept a Sinhala Buddhist Sri Lanka.

=====Politicized Buddhism, the formation of ethnocracy and the civil war=====
Upon independence Sinhalese Buddhist elites instituted discriminatory policies based on the Buddhist [[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalist]] ideology of the Mahavamsa that privileges Sinhalese Buddhist hegemony in the island as Buddha's chosen people for whom the island is a promised land and justifies subjugation of minorities.{{sfn|DeVotta|2007|pp=viii, 11}} Sinhalese Buddhist officials saw that decreasing Tamil influence was a necessary part of fostering Buddhist cultural renaissance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archive.ifla.org/IV/ifla72/papers/119-Knuth-en.pdf|title = Destroying a Symbol: Checkered History of Sri Lanka's Jaffna Public Library|date = |access-date = 20 February 2016|website = [[The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA)|publisher = |last = Knuth|first = Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutthagamani myth was also used to institute Sinhalese Buddhist domination with some politicians even identifying with such a mytho-historic hero and activist monks looked to Dutthagamani as an example to imitate. This principal hero of Mahavamsa became widely regarded as exemplary by the 20th century Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists because of his defense of Buddhism and the unification of Sri Lanka that journalists started talking about "the Mahavamsa mentality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Buddhism and Ethnic Conflict in Sri Lanka|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9XYNBQzYoYkC|publisher = SUNY Press|date = 2009-01-05|isbn = 9780791493670|language = en|first = Patrick|last = Grant|page = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[D. S. Senanayake]], who would become Sri Lanka's first prime minister in 1947, reaffirmed in 1939 the common Mahavamsa-based assumption of the Sinhalese Buddhist responsibility for the island's destiny by proclaiming that the Sinhalese Buddhists "are one blood and one nation. We are a chosen people. Buddha said that his religion would last for 5,500 [sic] years. That means that we, as the custodians of that religion, shall last as long."{{sfn|Bartholomeusz|2005|pp=142}} Buddhists monks became increasingly involved in post-independence politics, promoting Sinhalese Buddhist interests, at the expense of minorities. [[Walpola Rahula]], Sri Lanka's foremost Buddhist monk scholar and one of the leading proponents of Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism, played a major role in advocating for the involvement of monks in politics, using Buddhist king Dutthagamani's relationship with the sangha to bolster his position. Rahula also argued for a [[just war]] doctrine to protect Buddhism by using the example of wars waged by Dutthagamani to restore Buddhism.{{sfn|Bartholomeusz|2005|pp=78-79}} Rahula maintained that "the entire Sinhalese race was united under the banner of the young Gamini [Dutthagamani]. This was the beginning of nationalism among the Sinhalese. It was a new race with healthy young blood, organized under the new order of Buddhism. A kind of religionationalism, which almost amounted to fanaticism, roused the whole Sinhalese people. A non-Buddhist was not regarded as a human being. Evidently all Sinhalese without exception were Buddhists."{{sfn|DeVotta|2007|pp=22}} In reflecting on Rahula's works, anthropologist H.L. Seneviratne writes that, "it suits Rahula to be an advocate of a Buddhism that glorifies social intercourse with lay society ... the receipt of salaries and other forms of material remuneration; ethnic exclusivism and Sinhala Buddhist hegemony; militancy in politics; and violence, war and the spilling of blood in the name of "preserving the religion"".{{sfn|Deegalle|2006|pp=213}}

In 1956, the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress (ACBC) released a report titled, "The Betrayal of Buddhism", inquiring into the status of Buddhism in the island. The report argued that Buddhism had been weakened by external threats such as the Tamil invaders mentioned in the Mahavamsa and later [[Colonial history of Sri Lanka|Western colonial powers]]. It also demanded the state to restore and foster Buddhism and to give preferential treatment to Buddhist schools. The same year, [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]] capitalized on the ACBC report and its recommendations as the foundation for his election campaign, using it as the 'blueprint for a broad spectrum of policy', which included introducing Sinhala as the sole official language of the state. With the help of significant number of Buddhist monks and various Sinhalese Buddhist organizations, Bandaranaike became prime minister after winning the 1956 elections. Bandaranaike had also campaigned on the basis of Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism, drawing influences from the writings of Dharmapala and the Mahavamsa, arguing that it was the duty of the government to preserve the Sinhalese Buddhist nature of the island's destiny. Once in power, Bandaranaike implemented the 1956 [[Sinhala Only Act]], which would make Sinhala the country's official language and hence all official state transactions would be conducted in Sinhala. This put non-Sinhala speakers at a disadvantage for employment and educational opportunities. As a result, Tamils protested the policy by staging sit-ins, which in turn prompted counterdemonstrations by Buddhist monks, later degenerating into [[1956 Ceylonese riots|anti-Tamil riots]] in which more than one hundred people were injured and Tamil businesses were looted. Riots then spread throughout the country killing hundreds of people. Bandaranaike tried to mitigate tensions over the language policy by proposing a compromise with the Tamil leaders, resulting in a [[Bandaranaike–Chelvanayakam Pact|1957 pact]] that would allow the use of Tamil as an administrative language along with Sinhala and greater political autonomy for Tamils. Buddhist monks and other Sinhalese nationalists opposed this pact by staging mass demonstrations and hunger strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Path to Salvation: Religious Violence from the Crusades to Jihad|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fMvQAgAAQBAJ|publisher = [[Potomac Books]], Inc.|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 9781612346618|language = en|first = Heather Selma|last = Gregg|pages = 81–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial in the same year, a monk asks Bandaranaike to read Mahavamsa and to heed its lessons: "[Dutthagamani] conquered by the sword and united the land [Sri Lanka] without dividing it among our enemies [i.e. the Tamils] and established Sinhala and Buddhism as the state language and religion." In the late 1950s, it had become common for politicians and monks to exploit the Mahavamsa narrative of Dutthagamani to oppose any concession to the Tamil minorities.{{sfn|Bartholomeusz|2005|pp=12-13}}

With Buddhist monks playing a major role in exerting pressure to abrogate the pact, Bandaranaike acceded to their demands in April 9, 1958 by tearing up "a copy of the pact in front of the assembled monks who clapped in joy". Soon after the pact was abrogated, another series of [[1958 anti-Tamil pogrom|anti-Tamil riots]] spread throughout the country, which left hundreds dead and thousands displaced.{{sfn|Ganguly|Brown|2003|pp=127-128}} Preceding the 1958 riots, rhetoric of monks contributed to the perception of Tamils being the enemies of the country and of Buddhism. Both Buddhist monks and laity laid the foundation for the justifiable use of force against Tamils in response to their demand for greater autonomy by arguing that the whole of Sri Lanka was a promised land of the Sinhalese Buddhists and it was the role of the monks to defend a united Sri Lanka. Tamils were also portrayed as threatening interlopers, compared to the Mahavamsa account of the usurper Tamil king Elara. Monks and politicians invoked the story of the Buddhist warrior king Dutthagamani to urge the Sinhalese to fight against Tamils and their claims to the island, thereby providing justification for violence against Tamils. As Tessa J. Bartholomeusz explains: "Tamil claims to a homeland were met with an ideology, linked to a Buddhist story, that legitimated war with just cause: the protection of Sri Lanka for the Sinhala-Buddhist people."{{sfn|Bartholomeusz|2005|pp=82-94}} In order to appease Tamils amidst the ethnic tension, Bandaranaike modified the Sinhala Only Act to allow Tamil to be used in education and government in Tamil areas and as a result a, [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] named [[Talduwe Somarama]] assassinated him on September 26, 1959. The monk claimed he carried out the assassination "for the greater good of his country, race and religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Path to Salvation: Religious Violence from the Crusades to Jihad|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fMvQAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Potomac Books, Inc.|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 9781612346618|language = en|first = Heather Selma|last = Gregg|page = 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the monk was guided in part by reading of the Mahavamsa.{{sfn|Bartholomeusz|2005|pp=13-14}}

Successive governments after Bandaranaike implemented similar Sinhalese Buddhist nationalist agenda, at the expense of minorities. In 1972, the government rewrote its constitution and gave Buddhism "the foremost place [in the Republic of Sri Lanka]" and making it "the duty of the state to protect and foster Buddhism". With another pact in 1965 that sought to establish greater [[regional autonomy]] for Tamils being abrogated (some members of the Buddhist clergy were at the forefront in opposing the pact) and the implementation of [[Policy of standardisation|discriminatory quota system in 1974]] that severely restricted Tamil entrance to universities, [[Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups|Tamil youth]] became radicalized, calling for an [[Tamil Eelam|independent homeland]] to be established in the Tamil-dominated northeastern region of the island. In 1977, [[1977 anti-Tamil pogrom|anti-Tamil riots]] spread throughout the country, killing hundreds of Tamils and leaving thousands homeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Path to Salvation: Religious Violence from the Crusades to Jihad|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fMvQAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Potomac Books, Inc.|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 9781612346618|language = en|first = Heather Selma|last = Gregg|pages = 84–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leading monk claimed that one of the reasons for the anti-Tamil riots of 1977 was the Tamil demonization of the Sinhalese Buddhist epic hero Dutthagamani, which resulted in a justified retaliation.{{sfn|Bartholomeusz|2005|pp=94}} Another [[Burning of Jaffna library|anti-Tamil riot]] erupted in 1981 in [[Jaffna]], where Sinhalese police and paramilitaries destroyed statues of Tamil cultural and religious figures; looted and torched a Hindu temple and Tamil-owned shops and homes; killed four Tamils; and [[Burning of Jaffna library|torched the Jaffna Public Library]] which was of great cultural significance to Tamils.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In response to the militant separatist Tamil group [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|LTTE]] killing 13 Sinhalese soldiers, the largest [[Black July|anti-Tamil pogrom]] occurred in 1983, leaving between 2,000 and 3,000 of Tamils killed and forcing from 70,000 to 100,000 Tamils into refugee camps, eventually propelling the country into a [[Sri Lankan Civil War|civil war]] between the LTTE and the predominately Sinhalese Buddhist [[Government of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Path to Salvation: Religious Violence from the Crusades to Jihad|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fMvQAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Potomac Books, Inc.|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 9781612346618|language = en|first = Heather Selma|last = Gregg|pages = 86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom, Buddhist monks lead rioters in some instance. [[Cyril Mathew]], a Senior Minister in [[J. R.

The Mahavamsa narrative of Dutthagamani and Elara was also invoked to justify violence against Tamils. The aftermath of the pogrom spawned debates over the rights to the island with the "sons of the soil" ideology being called into prominence. A government agent declared that Sri Lanka's manifest destiny "was to uphold the pristine doctrine of Theravada Buddhism". This implied that Sinhalese Buddhists had a sacred claim to Sri Lanka, while the Tamils did not, a claim which might call for violence. The Sinhalese Buddhists, including the Sri Lankan government, resisted the Tamil claim to a separate homeland of their own as the Sinhalese Buddhists maintained that the entire country belonged to them. Another [[Ronnie de Mel|government agent]] linked the then Prime Minister Jayewardene's attempts to thwart the emergence of a [[Tamil Eelam|Tamil homeland]] to Dutthagamani's victory over Elara and went on to say, "[w]e will never allow the country to be divided," thereby justifying violence against Tamils.{{sfn|Bartholomeusz|2005|pp=87-96}}

In the context of increasing Tamil militant struggle for separatism, militant Buddhist monks founded the Mavbima Surakime Vyaparaya (MSV) or "Movement for the Protection of the Motherland" in 1986 which sought to work with political parties "to maintain territorial unity of Sri Lanka and Sinhalese Buddhist sovereignty over the island". The MSV used the Mahavamsa to justify its goals, which included the usage of force to fight against the Tamil threat and defend the Buddhist state. In 1987, along with the MSV, the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna|JVP]] (a militant Sinhalese nationalist group which included monks) took up arms to protest the signing of the [[Indo-Sri Lanka Accord]] which sought to establish peace in Sri Lanka by requiring the Sri Lankan government to make a number of concessions to Tamil demands, including [[Regionalism (politics)|devolution of power to Tamil provinces]]. The JVP, with the support of the Sangha, launched a campaign of violent [[1987–89 JVP insurrection|insurrection against the government]] to oppose the accord as the Sinhalese nationalists believed it would compromise the sovereignty of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Path to Salvation: Religious Violence from the Crusades to Jihad|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fMvQAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Potomac Books, Inc.|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 9781612346618|language = en|first = Heather Selma|last = Gregg|pages = 87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the civil war in 1983 to the end of it in 2009, Buddhist monks were involved in politics and opposed [[negotiation]]s, [[Ceasefire|ceasefire agreements]], or any [[Devolution|devolution of power]] to Tamil minorities, and most supported military solution to the conflict.{{sfn|Deegalle|2006|pp=205}}{{sfn|Bartholomeusz|2005|pp=32}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fundamentalisms and the State: Remaking Polities, Economies, and Militance|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=doCmVaOnh_wC|publisher = University of Chicago Press|date = 1996-07-01|isbn = 9780226508849|language = en|first = Martin E.|last = Marty|page = 614|quote = "the majority of monks explicitly or privately supported and condoned the Sinhalese army's killings of Tamil guerrillas."}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to Asanga Tilakaratne, head of the Department of Buddhist Philosophy in the Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies in Colombo, to remark that "the Sinhala Buddhist nationalists are ... opposed to any attempt to solve the ethnic problem by peaceful means; and they call for a '[[Religious war|holy war]]' against Tamils".{{sfn|Bartholomeusz|2005|pp=160}} It has been argued that the absence of opportunities for [[Consociationalism|power sharing]] among the different ethnic groups in the island "has been one of the primary factors behind the intensification of the conflict".{{sfn|Deegalle|2006|pp=186}} Numerous Buddhist religious leaders and Buddhist organizations since the country's independence have played a role in mobilizing against the devolution of power to the Tamils.

According to A. R. M.

The JHU, in shunning non-violent solutions to the ethnic conflict, urged young Sinhalese Buddhists to sign up for the army, with as many as 30,000 Sinhalese young men doing just that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Politicization of Buddhism and Electoral Politics in Sri Lanka|ssrn = 1567618|publisher = Social Science Research Network|date = 2010-03-09|location = Rochester, NY|first = Abdul|last = Razak|first2 = Mohamed|last2 = Imtiyaz|pages = 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One JHU leader even declared that [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and certain government servants were traitors and they should be set on fire and burnt due to their opposition to a military solution to the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sinhalese Buddhist Nationalist Ideology: Implications for Politics and Conflict Resolution in Sri Lanka|url = http://www.eastwestcenter.org/system/tdf/private/ps040.pdf?file=1&amp;type=node&amp;id=32212|publisher = East-West Center Washington|date = 2007-01-01|isbn = 9781932728644|language = en|first = Neil|last = DeVotta|page = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international community encouraged a [[Federalism|federal structure]] for Sri Lanka as a peaceful solution to the civil war but any form of Tamil self-determination, even the more limited measure of autonomy, was strongly opposed by hard-line Sinhalese Buddhist nationalist groups such as the JVP and JHU, who pushed for the military solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sinhalese Buddhist Nationalist Ideology: Implications for Politics and Conflict Resolution in Sri Lanka|url = http://www.eastwestcenter.org/system/tdf/private/ps040.pdf?file=1&amp;type=node&amp;id=32212|publisher = East-West Center Washington|date = 2007-01-01|isbn = 9781932728644|language = en|first = Neil|last = DeVotta|page = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sri Lanka's Buddhist monks are intent on war|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1554817/Sri-Lankas-Buddhist-monks-are-intent-on-war.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|access-date = 2016-02-20|first = Mian|last = Ridge|quote = "The monks have used their new power to argue vociferously against any self-determination for the Tamils in the north, opposing even the more limited measure of autonomy that most observers believe is necessary for peace.

=====Violence against religious minorities=====
Other minority groups have also come under attack by Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists. Fear of country's Buddhist hegemony being challenged by Christian proselytism has driven Buddhist monks and organizations to demonize Christian organizations with one popular monk comparing missionary activity to terrorism; as a result, Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists, including the JVP and JHU, who oppose attempts to convert Buddhists to another religion, support or conduct [[Persecution of Christians|anti-Christian violence]]. The number of attacks against Christian churches rose from 14 in 2000 to over 100 in 2003.

=====Buddhist opposition to Sinhala Buddhist nationalism=====
Sinhala Buddhist Nationalism is opposed to Sarvodaya, although they share many of the same influences like [[Dharmapāla]]'s teachings for example, by having a focus upon Sinhalese culture and ethnicity sanctioning the use of violence in defence of dhamma, while Sarvodaya has emphasized the application of Buddhist values in order to transform society and campaigning for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powers|first1=John|title=Destroying Mara Forever: Buddhist Ethics Essays in Honor of Damien Keown|date=2009|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|isbn=9781559397889|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7zO-zLaSwXoC&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These Buddhist nationalists have been opposed by the [[Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement]], a [[self-governance]] movement led by the Buddhist Dr. [[A. T. Ariyaratne]] and based in Buddhist ideals, who condemn the use of violence and the denial of [[Human rights]] to Tamils and other non-Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Thomas Banchoff]]|author2=[[Robert Wuthnow]]|title=Religion and the Global Politics of Human Rights|date=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=[[Oxford]]|isbn=9780199841035|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oVViGSEpu8C&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ariyaratne calls for non-violent action and he has been actively working for peace in Sri Lanka for many decades, and has stated that the only way to peace is through "the dispelling of the view of 'I and mine' or the shedding of 'self' and the realization of the true doctrines of the interconnection between all animal species and the unity of all humanity,"&lt;ref&gt;Bond, George. "Buddhism at Work: Community Development, Social Empowerment and the Sarvodaya Movement". (Kumarian P, 2003) 42&lt;/ref&gt; thus advocating social action in Buddhist terms. He stated in one of his lectures, "When we work towards the welfare of all the means we use have to be based on Truth, Non-violence and Selflessness in conformity with Awakening of All".&lt;ref name="Bond, George 2003"&gt;Bond, George. "Buddhism at Work: Community Development, Social Empowerment and the Sarvodaya Movement". (Kumarian P, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; What Ariyaratne advocates is losing the self in the service of others and attempting to bring others to awakening. Ariyaratne has stated, "I cannot awaken myself unless I help awaken others".&lt;ref name="Bond, George 2003"/&gt;

The beginning of "Buddhist violence" in Japan relates to a long history of feuds among Buddhists. The [[sōhei]] or "warrior monks" appeared during the [[Heian period]], although the seeming contradiction in being a Buddhist "warrior monk" caused controversy even at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=D.Gort, Jerald; Jensen, Henry; H.

In Osaka they defended their temple with the slogan "The mercy of Buddha should be recompensed even by pounding flesh to pieces. One's obligation to the Teacher should be recompensed even by smashing bones to bits!"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lani3dFCC9UC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Religion in Japanese History] by Joseph M.

During [[World War II]], Japanese Buddhist literature from that time, as part of its support of the Japanese war effort, stated "In order to establish eternal peace in East Asia, arousing the great benevolence and compassion of Buddhism, we are sometimes accepting and sometimes forceful. We now have no choice but to exercise the benevolent forcefulness of 'killing one in order that many may live' (issatsu tashō).

In response the Japanese Pan-Buddhist Society (Myowa Kai) rejected the criticism and stated that "We now have no choice but to exercise the benevolent forcefulness of 'killing one in order that many may live' (issatsu tashō)" and that the war was absolutely necessary to implement the [[dharma]] in Asia.

[[Brian Victoria|Brian Daizen Victoria]], a Buddhist priest in the [[Sōtō Zen]] sect, documented in his book ''[[Zen at War]]'' how Buddhist institutions justified [[Japanese militarism]] in official publications and cooperated with the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and [[World War II]]. In response to the book, several sects issued an apology for their wartime support of the government.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Zen at War'' (2nd ed.) by Brian Daizen Victoria, Rowman and Littlefield 2006, {{ISBN|0-7425-3926-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more modern times instances of Buddhist-inspired terrorism or militarism have occurred in Japan, such as the assassinations of the [[League of Blood Incident]] led by [[Nissho Inoue]], a [[Nichirenism|Nichirenist]] or fascist-nationalist who preached a self-styled [[Nichiren Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[Naoko Shimazu]] |title=Nationalisms in Japan (Sheffield Centre for Japanese Studies/Routledge) |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Nationalisms_in_Japan.html?id=_ixJ4wd9TjIC&amp;hl |location= |publisher=[[Routledge]] |page=89 |date=August 2006 |isbn=978-0415546843 |access-date=14 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7BW_RA-7AtQC&amp;pg=PA89 |title=Teaching Religion and Violence |first=Brian K. |last=Pennington |publisher=OUP USA |year=2012 |isbn=9780195372427 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;堀まきよう　（Makiyo Hori）,「井上日召と"かぎの折伏"：血盟団事件について」（"Inoue Nissho and his Terrorist Ideas: Some Notes on the Oath of Blood Group"）早稲田政治経済学雑誌（The Waseda Journal of Political Science and Economics） 328 p.178 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Celtic mythology}}
A '''druid''' ({{lang-cy|derwydd}}; {{lang-sga|druí}}; {{lang-gd|draoidh}}) was a member of the high-ranking professional class in ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] cultures. While perhaps best remembered as religious leaders, they were also legal authorities, adjudicators, lorekeepers, medical professionals, and political advisors. While the druids are reported to have been literate, they are believed to have been prevented by doctrine from recording their knowledge in written form, thus they left no written accounts of themselves. They are however attested in some detail by their contemporaries from other cultures, such as the Romans and the Greeks.

The earliest known references to the druids date to the fourth century [[Common Era|BCE]] and the oldest detailed description comes from [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' (50s BCE). They were also described by later Greco-Roman writers such as [[Cicero]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Cic44|Cicero 44]]. I.XVI.90.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tac|Tacitus]]. XIV.30.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pliny the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pli78|Pliny c.78]]. XVI.249.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Roman invasion of Gaul, the druid orders were suppressed by the Roman government under the 1st century CE emperors [[Tiberius]] and [[Claudius]], and had disappeared from the written record by the 2nd century.

In about 750 CE the word ''druid'' appears in a poem by [[Blathmac]], who wrote about [[Jesus]], saying that he was "... better than a prophet, more knowledgeable than every druid, a king who was a bishop and a complete sage."&lt;ref&gt;Mac Mathúna, Liam (1999) [http://www.celt.dias.ie/publications/celtica/c23/c23-174.pdf "Irish Perceptions of the Cosmos"] ''Celtica,'' vol. 23 (1999), 174–187 (p. 181).&lt;/ref&gt; The druids then also appear in some of the medieval tales from Christianized Ireland like the "[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]", where they are largely portrayed as [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] who opposed the coming of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. pp. 32–37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the [[Celtic revival]] during the 18th and 19th centuries, fraternal and [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] groups were founded based on ideas about the ancient druids, a movement known as [[Neo-Druidism]]. Many popular notions about druids, based on misconceptions of 18th century scholars, have been largely superseded by more recent study.&lt;ref name="BMD"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title =  The Druids | work = | publisher = The British Museum |date= | url = https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/articles/d/the_Druids.aspx | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150225173345/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/articles/d/the_druids.aspx | archivedate = 2015-02-25 | doi = | accessdate = 2016-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The modern English word ''druid'' derives from the Latin ''druidēs'' (plural), which was considered by ancient Roman writers to come from the native Celtic Gaulish word for these figures.&lt;ref name="Piggott 1968 Page 89"&gt;[[#Pig68|Piggott 1968]]. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DDruides Druides], Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus project.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiel"&gt;Caroline aan de Wiel, "Druids [3] the word", in ''Celtic Culture''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Roman texts also employ the form ''druidae'', while the same term was used by [[Greek ethnographers]] as {{lang|grc|δρυΐδης}} (''druidēs'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*droui%2Fdhs Δρουίδης],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pokorny's ''[[Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch]]'', see also ''American Heritage Dictionary'' (4th ed.), [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2328470 Δρυίδης].&lt;/ref&gt; Although no extant Romano-Celtic inscription is known to contain the form,&lt;ref name="Piggott 1968 Page 89" /&gt; the word is cognate with the later insular Celtic words, [[Old Irish]] ''druí'' ‘druid, sorcerer’, [[Old Cornish]] ''druw'', [[Middle Welsh]] ''dryw'' ‘[[Prophet|seer]]; [[wren]]’.&lt;ref name="Wiel" /&gt; Based on all available forms, the hypothetical proto-Celtic word may then be reconstructed as *''dru-wid-s'' (pl. *''druwides'') meaning "[[oak]]-knower". The two elements go back to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] roots ''*deru-''&lt;ref&gt;Proto-IE &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''deru-'', a cognate to English ''tree'', is the word for "oak", though the root has a wider array of meanings related to "to be firm, solid, steadfast" (whence e.g. English ''[[truth|true]]''). ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language''. Fourth Edition, 2000 [https://web.archive.org/web/20080726143746/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE87.html Indo-European Roots: deru-].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''*weid-'' "to see".&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'': Fourth Edition, 2000 [https://web.archive.org/web/20080726143746/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE556.html Indo-European Roots: weid-].&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of "oak-knower" or "oak-seer" is supported by [[Pliny the Elder]],&lt;ref name="Wiel" /&gt; who in his ''Natural History'' considered the word to contain the Greek noun ''drýs'' (δρύς), "oak-tree"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddru%3Ds δρῦς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Greek suffix ''-idēs'' (-ιδης).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=end&amp;lookup=idhs&amp;lang=greek List of ancient Greek words ending in -ιδης], on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Old Irish ''druí'' and Middle Welsh ''dryw'' could also refer to the [[wren]],&lt;ref name="Wiel" /&gt; possibly connected with an association of that bird with [[augury]] in Irish and Welsh tradition (see also [[Wren Day]]).&lt;ref name="Wiel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See further Brian Ó Cuív, "Some [[Gaels|Gaelic]] traditions about the wren". ''[[Éigse]]'' 18 (1980): pp. 43–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices and doctrines ==
Sources by ancient and medieval writers provide an idea of the religious duties and social roles involved in being a druid.

=== Societal role and training ===
[[File:An Arch Druid in His Judicial Habit.jpg|thumb| Imaginative illustration of 'An Arch Druid in His Judicial Habit', from ''The Costume of the Original Inhabitants of the British Islands'' by S.R. Meyrick and C.H. Smith (1815), the gold [[gorget]] collar copying Irish [[Bronze Age]] examples.&lt;ref&gt;There are nine surviving gorget collars, seven in the [[National Museum of Ireland]], all dating from the late Bronze Age, 800–700 BCE. Wallace, Patrick F., O'Floinn, Raghnall eds. ''Treasures of the National Museum of Ireland: Irish Antiquities'', 2002, Gill &amp; Macmillan, Dublin, {{ISBN|0-7171-2829-6}}, pp. 88–89, 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Greco-Roman and the vernacular Irish sources agree that the druids played an important part in pagan Celtic society. In his description, [[Julius Caesar]] claimed that they were one of the two most important social groups in the region (alongside the ''equites'', or nobles) and were responsible for organizing worship and sacrifices, divination, and judicial procedure in Gaulish, British, and Irish societies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Julius Caesar|Caesar, Julius]]. ''De bello gallico''. VI.13–18.&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in source|reason=At least at http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/caesar/gallic_e6.html there is no apparent reference to Irish society and Britain is only mentioned once, Caesar quoting a rumour.|date=February 2018}} He also claimed that they were exempt from military service and from the payment of taxes, and had the power to excommunicate people from religious festivals, making them social outcasts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Two other classical writers, [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Strabo]], also wrote about the role of druids in Gallic society, claiming that the druids were held in such respect that if they intervened between two armies they could stop the battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut07|Hutton 2007]]. pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pomponius Mela]]&lt;ref&gt;Pomponius Mela iii.2.18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; is the first author who says that the druids' instruction was secret and took place in caves and forests.

Druidic lore consisted of a large number of verses learned by heart, and Caesar remarked that it could take up to twenty years to complete the course of study. What was taught to druid novices anywhere is conjecture: of the druids' [[oral literature]], not one certifiably ancient verse is known to have survived, even in translation. All instruction was communicated orally, but for ordinary purposes, Caesar reports,&lt;ref&gt;''Gallic Wars'' vi.14.3.&lt;/ref&gt; the Gauls had a written language in which they used Greek characters. In this he probably draws on earlier writers; by the time of Caesar, [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] inscriptions had moved from the Greek script to the Latin script.

=== Sacrifice ===
[[File:The Wicker Man of the Druids.jpg|thumb|An 18th century illustration of a [[wicker man]], the form of execution that Caesar claimed the druids used for human sacrifice. From the "Duncan Caesar", Tonson, Draper, and Dodsley edition of the ''Commentaries of Caesar'' translated by William Duncan published in 1753.&lt;!-- Having written that I'm suddenly not so sure, it's similar to Duncan Caesar but might be later imitation. --&gt;]]
{{Further information|Celts and human sacrifice|Threefold death|Ritual of oak and mistletoe}}

Greek and Roman writers frequently made reference to the druids as practitioners of [[human sacrifice]].&lt;ref&gt;Reports of druids performing human sacrifice are found in the works of [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]], ''Pharsalia'' i.450-58; Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'' vi.16, 17.3-5; Suetonius, ''Claudius'' 25; [[Cicero]], ''Pro Font.'' 31; Cicero, ''De Rep.'' 9 (15);cited after Norman J. DeWitt, "The Druids and Romanization" ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' '''69''' (1938:319-332) p. 321, note 4.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Caesar, those who had been found guilty of theft or other criminal offences were considered preferable for use as sacrificial victims, but when criminals were in short supply, innocents would be acceptable. A form of sacrifice recorded by Caesar was the burning alive of victims in a large wooden effigy, now often known as a [[wicker man]]. A differing account came from the 10th-century ''[[Commenta Bernensia]]'', which claimed that sacrifices to the deities [[Teutates]], [[Esus]] and [[Taranis]] were by drowning, hanging and burning, respectively (see [[threefold death]]).

[[Diodorus Siculus]] asserts that a sacrifice acceptable to the [[Celtic deities|Celtic gods]] had to be attended by a druid, for they were the intermediaries between the people and the divinities. He remarked upon the importance of prophets in druidic ritual:
:"These men predict the future by observing the flight and calls of birds and by the sacrifice of holy animals: all orders of society are in their power... and in very important matters they prepare a human victim, plunging a dagger into his chest; by observing the way his limbs convulse as he falls and the gushing of his blood, they are able to read the future."

There is archaeological evidence from western Europe that has been widely used to back up the idea that human sacrifice was performed by the Iron Age Celts.
Mass graves found in a ritual context dating from this period have been unearthed in Gaul, at both [[Gournay-sur-Aronde]] and [[Ribemont-sur-Ancre]] in what was the region of the Belgae chiefdom. The excavator of these sites, Jean-Louis Brunaux, interpreted them as areas of human sacrifice in devotion to a war god,&lt;ref&gt;Brunaux, Jean-Louis (2001). "Gallic Blood Rites" in ''Archaeology'' 54.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunaux, Jean-Louis (2002). "Le Santuaire gaulois de Gournay-sur-Aronde" in Bulletin 56 of the Archaeological and Historical Company of Boulounge-Conchy-Hainvillers.&lt;/ref&gt; although this view was criticized by another archaeologist, Martin Brown, who believed that the corpses might be those of honoured warriors buried in the sanctuary rather than sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald, ''The Druids'' (London: Hambledon Continuum, 2007 pp. 133–134.)&lt;/ref&gt;
Some historians have questioned whether the Greco-Roman writers were accurate in their claims. J. Rives remarked that it was "ambiguous" whether the druids ever performed such sacrifices, for the Romans and Greeks were known to project what they saw as barbarian traits onto foreign peoples including not only druids but Jews and Christians as well, thereby confirming their own "cultural superiority" in their own minds.&lt;ref&gt;Rives, J. (1995). "Human Sacrifice among Pagans and Christians" in ''Journal of Roman Studies,'' p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nora Chadwick]], an expert in medieval Welsh and Irish literature who believed the druids to be great philosophers, has also supported the idea that they had not been involved in human sacrifice, and that such accusations were imperialist Roman propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cha66|Chadwick 1966]]. pp. xviii, 28, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy ===
[[Alexander Cornelius Polyhistor]] referred to the druids as philosophers and called their doctrine of the immortality of the soul and [[reincarnation]] or [[metempsychosis]] "[[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]]":
:"The Pythagorean doctrine prevails among the Gauls' teaching that the souls of men are immortal, and that after a fixed number of years they will enter into another body."

Caesar made similar observations: 

{{quote|With regard to their actual course of studies, the main object of all education is, in their opinion, to imbue their scholars with a firm belief in the indestructibility of the human soul, which, according to their belief, merely passes at death from one tenement to another; for by such doctrine alone, they say, which robs death of all its terrors, can the highest form of human courage be developed. Subsidiary to the teachings of this main principle, they hold various lectures and discussions on [[astronomy]], on the extent and geographical distribution of the globe, on the different branches of natural philosophy, and on many problems connected with religion.|Julius Caesar, ''De Bello Gallico'', VI, 13}}

[[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in 36 BCE, described how the druids followed "the Pythagorean doctrine", that human souls "are immortal and after a prescribed number of years they commence a new life in a new body."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]]. ''Bibliotheca historicae''. V.21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, folklorist [[Donald Alexander Mackenzie|Donald A. Mackenzie]] speculated that Buddhist missionaries had been sent by the Indian king [[Ashoka]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald A.Mackenzie, ''Buddhism in pre-Christian Britain'' (1928:21).&lt;/ref&gt; Others have invoked [[Proto-Indo-European religion|common Indo-European]] parallels.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Bonewits, ''Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism'', Citadel, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar noted the druidic doctrine of the original ancestor of the tribe, whom he referred to as '' [[Jupiter (mythology)|Dispater]],'' or ''Father [[Hades]].''

==Druids in mythology==
Druids also play a prominent role in [[Irish Folklore]], generally serving lords and kings as high ranking priest-counselors with the gift of prophecy and other assorted mystical abilities - the best example of these possibly being [[Cathbad]]. The chief druid in the court of King [[Conchobar mac Nessa]] of [[Ulster]], Cathbad features in several tales, most of which detail his ability to foretell the future. In the tale of [[Deirdre|Deirdre of the Sorrows]] – the foremost [[tragic heroine]] of the [[Ulster Cycle]] – the druid prophesied before the court of Conchobar that Deirdre would grow up to be very beautiful, but that kings and lords would go to war over her, much blood would be shed because of her, and Ulster's three greatest warriors would be forced into exile for her sake. This prophecy, ignored by the king, came true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/hroi/hroiv1.htm |title=Heroic Romances of Ireland|volume= I |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably the greatest of these mythological druids was [[Amergin Glúingel]],&lt;ref&gt;Also spelled Amairgin, Amorgen, Aimhirghin&lt;/ref&gt; a [[bard]] and judge for the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] featured in the [[Mythological Cycle]]. The Milesians were seeking to overrun the [[Tuatha De Danann]] and win the land of Ireland but, as they approached, the druids of the Tuatha Dé Danann raised a magical storm to bar their ships from making landfall. Thus Amergin called upon the spirit of Ireland itself, chanting a powerful incantation that has come to be known as ''The Song of Amergin''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/gafm/gafm09.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and, eventually (after successfully making landfall), aiding and dividing the land between his royal brothers in the conquest of Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'' [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/lebor5.html §65-95]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maighréad C. Ní Dobs, [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/tochomlad-e.html "''Tochomlad mac Miledh a hEspain i nErind: no Cath Tailten?''"] ''Études Celtiques'' v.II, Paris: Librairie E. Droz, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foas Feasa ar Éirinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text031.html 1.21], [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text032.html 22], [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text033.html 23]&lt;/ref&gt; earning the title [[Chief Ollam of Ireland]].

Other such mythological druids were [[Tadg mac Nuadat]]  of the [[Fenian Cycle]], and [[Mug Ruith]], a powerful blind druid of [[Munster]].

==Female druids==
[[File:Alexandre Cabanel 004.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''The Druidess'', oil on canvas, by French painter [[Alexandre Cabanel]] (1823–1890)]]
[[Irish mythology]] has a number of female druids as well, often sharing similar prominent cultural and religious roles with their male counterparts. The Irish have several words for female druids, such as ''bandruí'' ("woman-druid"), found in tales such as the [[Táin Bó Cúailnge]];&lt;ref name=DILbandrui&gt;{{cite web |last1=|first1= |title=Drui |url=http://edil.qub.ac.uk/advanced_search?q=bandr%C3%BAid&amp;search_in=citation#search_results |website=[[Dictionary of the Irish Language]] (eDIL) |publisher=[[Royal Irish Academy]] (RIA)|accessdate=11 February 2016}} 1c: "dialt feminine declension, Auraic. 1830. bandruí druidess; female skilled in magic arts: tri ferdruid ┐ tri bandrúid, TBC 2402 = dī (leg. tri) drúid insin ┐ a teóra mná, TBC² 1767."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bodhmall]], featured in the [[Fenian Cycle]], and one of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]]'s childhood caretakers;&lt;ref name="Parkes 2004 pp. 587"&gt;Parkes, "Fosterage, Kinship, &amp; Legend", Cambridge University Press, Comparative Studies in Society and History (2004), 46: pp. 587–615.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tlachtga]],&lt;ref name="maryjones.us"&gt;Jones, Mary.

[[Biróg]], another ''bandrúi'' of the [[Tuatha De Danann]], plays a key role in an [[Irish Folklore|Irish folktale]] where the [[Fomorians|Fomorian]] warrior [[Balor]] attempts to thwart a prophecy foretelling that he would be killed by his own grandson by imprisoning his only daughter [[Ethniu|Eithne]] in the tower of [[Tory Island]], away from any contact with men.&lt;ref name="O'Donovan"&gt;[[John O'Donovan (scholar)|O'Donovan, John]] (ed. &amp; trans.), ''Annala Rioghachta Éireann: Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters'' Vol. 1, 1856, pp. 18–21, footnote ''S''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rolleston&gt;T.

===The ''Gallizenae''===
[[File:Chausseedesein.png|thumb|left|upright=1.8|Location of Île de Sein in the Atlantic Ocean]]
According to classical authors, the Gallizenae (or Gallisenae) were virgin priestesses of the [[Île de Sein]] off Pointe du Raz, Finistère, western Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095841445&lt;/ref&gt; Their existence was first mentioned by the Greek geographer [[Artemidorus Ephesius]] and later by the Greek historian [[Strabo]], who wrote that their island was forbidden to men, but the women came to the mainland to meet their husbands. Which deities they honored is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, J. A. The Religion of the Ancient Celts. Auckland, N.Z.]: Floating Press, 2009. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B6slu3qt_5YC&amp;pg=PA405 p. 405]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pomponius Mela, the Gallizenae acted as both councilors and practitioners of the healing arts:

"Sena, in the Britannic Sea, opposite the coast of the Osismi, is famous for its oracle of a Gaulish god, whose priestesses, living in the holiness of perpetual virginity, are said to be nine in number.

== Sources on druid beliefs and practices ==

=== Greek and Roman records ===
[[File:Druids Inciting the Britons to Oppose the Landing of the Romans.jpg|thumb|Druids Inciting the Britons to Oppose the Landing of the Romans – from Cassell's ''History of England'', Vol. I – anonymous author and artists]]

The earliest surviving literary evidence of the druids emerges from the classical world of Greece and Rome. The archaeologist [[Stuart Piggott]] compared the attitude of the Classical authors towards the druids as being similar to the relationship that had existed in the 15th and 18th centuries between Europeans and the societies that they were just encountering in other parts of the world, such as the Americas and the South Sea Islands. In doing so, he highlighted that both the attitude of the Early Modern Europeans and the Classical authors was that of "[[primitivism]]", viewing these newly encountered societies as primitive because of their lesser technological development and perceived backwardness in socio-political development.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pig75|Piggott 1975]]. p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Nora Chadwick]], in a categorization subsequently adopted by Piggott, divided the Classical accounts of the druids into two groups, distinguished by their approach to the subject as well as their chronological contexts. She refers to the first of these groups as the "Posidonian" tradition after one of its primary exponents, Posidonious, and notes that it takes a largely critical attitude towards the Iron Age societies of Western Europe that emphasizes their "barbaric" qualities. The second of these two groups is termed the "Alexandrian" group, being centred on the scholastic traditions of [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]]; she notes that it took a more sympathetic and idealized attitude towards these foreign peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pig75|Piggott 1975]]. pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Piggott drew parallels between this categorisation and the ideas of "hard primitivism" and "soft primitivism" identified by [[history of ideas|historians of ideas]] [[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A.O. Lovejoy]] and [[Franz Boas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pig75|Piggott 1975]]. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

One school of thought within historical scholarship has suggested that all of these accounts are inherently unreliable, and might be entirely fictional. They have suggested that the idea of the druid might have been a fiction created by Classical writers to reinforce the idea of the barbaric "other" who existed beyond the civilized Greco-Roman world, thereby legitimising the expansion of the Roman Empire into these areas.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[#Ald10|Aldhouse-Green 2010]]. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest record of the druids comes from two Greek texts of c. 300 BCE: one, a history of philosophy written by Sotion of Alexandria, and the other a study of magic widely attributed to [[Aristotle]]. Both texts are now lost, but were quoted in the 2nd century CE work ''Vitae'' by [[Diogenes Laertius]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius. ''Vitae''. Introduction, section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote
|Some say that the study of philosophy originated with the barbarians. In that among the Persians there existed the Magi, and among the Babylonians or Assyrians the Chaldaei, among the Indians the Gymnosophistae, and among the Celts and Gauls men who were called druids and semnothei, as Aristotle relates in his book on magic, and Sotion in the twenty-third book of his Succession of Philosophers.

Subsequent Greek and Roman texts from the third century BCE refer to "[[barbarian]] philosophers",&lt;ref&gt;Twenty references were presented in tabular form by Jane Webster, "At the End of the World: Druidic and Other Revitalization Movements in Post-Conquest Gaul and Britain" ''Britannia'' '''30''' (1999:1–20):2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly in reference to the Gaulish druids.

==== Julius Caesar ====
[[File:Gaius Julius Caesar (100-44 BC).JPG|thumb|upright|Julius Caesar, the Roman general and later [[Roman dictator|dictator]], who wrote the most important source for the Druids in Britain]]

The earliest extant text that describes the druids in detail is [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', book VI, written in the 50s or 40s BCE. A military general who was intent on conquering Gaul and Britain, Caesar described the druids as being concerned with "divine worship, the due performance of sacrifices, private or public, and the interpretation of ritual questions." He claimed that they played an important part in Gaulish society, being one of the two respected classes along with the ''equites'' (in Rome the name for members of a privileged class above the common people, but also "horsemen") and that they performed the function of judges. He claimed that they recognized the authority of a single leader, who would rule until his death, when a successor would be chosen by vote or through conflict. He also remarked that they met annually at a sacred place in the region occupied by the [[Carnutes|Carnute]] tribe in Gaul, while they viewed Britain as the centre of druidic study; and that they were not found amongst the German tribes to the east of the [[Rhine]]. According to Caesar, many young men were trained to be druids, during which time they had to learn all the associated lore by heart. He also claimed their main teaching was "the souls do not perish, but after death pass from one to another". They were also concerned with "the stars and their movements, the size of the cosmos and the earth, the world of nature, and the power and might of the immortal gods", indicating they were involved with not only such common aspects of religion as [[theology]] and [[cosmology]], but also [[astronomy]]. Caesar also held that they were "administrators" during rituals of [[human sacrifice]], for which criminals were usually used, and that the method was through burning in a [[wicker man]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Although he had first-hand experience of Gaulish people, and therefore likely with druids, Caesar's account has been widely criticized by modern historians as inaccurate. One issue raised by such historians as [[Fustel de Coulanges]]&lt;ref&gt;de Coulanges, Fustel (1891). ''La Gaule romaine''. Paris. Page 03.&lt;/ref&gt; was that while Caesar described the druids as a significant power within Gaulish society, he did not mention them even once in his accounts of his Gaulish conquests. Nor did [[Aulus Hirtius]], who continued Caesar's account of the Gallic Wars following Caesar's death. Hutton believed that Caesar had manipulated the idea of the druids so they would appear both civilized (being learned and pious) and barbaric (performing human sacrifice) to Roman readers, thereby representing both "a society worth including in the [[Roman Empire]]" and one that required civilizing with Roman rule and values, thus justifying his wars of conquest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. pp. 04–05.&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Dunham suggested that Caesar had simply taken the Roman religious functions of senators and applied them to the druids.&lt;ref&gt;Dunham, Sean B. (1995). "Caesar's Perception of Gallic Social Structures" in Celtic Chiefdom, Celtic State (Eds: Bettina Arnold and D. Blair Gibson). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; endorsed by Maier, Bernhard (2003). ''The Celts''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. Pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Daphne Nash believed it "not unlikely" that he "greatly exaggerates" both the centralized system of druidic leadership and its connection to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Daphne (1976). "Reconstructing Posidonius's Celtic Ethnography" in ''Britannia'' 7. Page 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other historians have accepted that Caesar's account might be more accurate. Norman J. DeWitt surmised that Caesar's description of the role of druids in Gaulish society may report an idealized tradition, based on the society of the 2nd century BCE, before the pan-Gallic confederation led by the [[Arverni]] was smashed in 121 BCE, followed by the invasions of [[Teutones]] and [[Cimbri]], rather than on the demoralized and disunited Gaul of his own time.&lt;ref&gt;DeWitt 1938:324f.&lt;/ref&gt; John Creighton has speculated that in Britain, the druidic social influence was already in decline by the mid-1st century BCE, in conflict with emergent new power structures embodied in paramount chieftains.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, "Visions of power: imagery and symbols in Late Iron Age Britain" ''Britannia'' '''26''' (1995: pp. 285–301; especially p. 296f).&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars see the Roman conquest itself as the main reason for the decline of the druid orders.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Jane Webster, in "At the End of the World: Druidic and Other Revitalization Movements in Post-Conquest Gaul and Britain" ''Britannia'' '''30''' (1999: pp. 1–20 and full bibliography).&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist [[Miranda Aldhouse-Green]] (2010) asserted that Caesar offered both “our richest textual source” regarding the druids, and “one of the most reliable.” She defended the accuracy of his accounts by highlighting that while he may have embellished some of his accounts to justify Roman imperial conquest, it was “inherently unlikely” that he constructed a fictional class system for Gaul and Britain, particularly considering that he was accompanied by a number of other Roman senators who would have also been sending reports on the conquest to Rome, and who would have challenged his inclusion of serious falsifications.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

==== Cicero, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo and Tacitus ====
[[File:Romans murdering Druids and burning their groves cropped.jpg|thumb|Roman soldiers murdering druids and burning their groves on [[Anglesey]], as described by [[Tacitus]]]]
[[File:Deal crownSCF6586.jpg|thumb|left|Crown of the "[[Deal, Kent|Deal]] Warrior", possibly worn by druids, 200–150 BCE, [[British Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/s/skull__crown_of_deal_warrior.aspx Skull and crown of the 'Deal Warrior']&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Other classical writers also commented on the druids and their practices. Caesar's contemporary, [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], noted that he had met a Gallic druid, [[Diviciacus (Aedui)|Divitiacus]], who was a member of the Aedui tribe. Divitiacus supposedly knew much about the natural world and performed divination through [[augury]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Whether Diviaticus was genuinely a druid can however be disputed, for Caesar also knew this figure, and also wrote about him, calling him by the more Gaulish-sounding (and thereby presumably the more authentic) Diviciacus, but never referred to him as a druid and indeed presented him as a political and military leader.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. p. 05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another classical writer to take up describing the druids not too long after was [[Diodorus Siculus]], who published this description in his ''Bibliotheca historicae'' in 36 BCE. Alongside the druids, or as he called them, ''drouidas'', whom he viewed as philosophers and theologians, he also remarked how there were poets and singers in Celtic society whom he called ''bardous'', or [[bard]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; Such an idea was expanded on by [[Strabo]], writing in the 20s CE, who declared that amongst the Gauls, there were three types of honoured figures: the poets and singers known as ''bardoi'', the diviners and specialists in the natural world known as ''o'vateis'', and those who studied "moral philosophy", the ''druidai''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]]. ''Geographica''. IV.4.4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Roman writer [[Tacitus]], himself a senator and a historian, described how when the Roman army, led by [[Suetonius Paulinus]], attacked the island of Mona ([[Anglesey]], ''[[Isle of Anglesey|Ynys Môn]]'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), the legionaries were awestruck on landing by the appearance of a band of druids, who, with hands uplifted to the sky, poured forth terrible imprecations on the heads of the invaders. He states that these "terrified our soldiers who had never seen such a thing before..." The courage of the Romans, however, soon overcame such fears, according to the Roman historian; the Britons were put to flight, and the [[sacred grove]]s of Mona were cut down.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tac|Tacitus]]. 14.30.&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus is also the only primary source that gives accounts of druids in Britain, but maintains a hostile point of view, seeing them as ignorant savages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rut78|Rutherford 1978]]. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Irish and Welsh records ===
During the Middle Ages, after Ireland and Wales were [[Christianization|Christianized]], druids appeared in a number of written sources, mainly tales and stories such as the ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'', but also in the [[hagiography|hagiographies]] of various saints. These were all written by Christian monks.

==== Irish literature and law codes ====
In Irish-language literature, the druids — ''draoithe'', plural of ''draoi''— are [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] with [[supernatural]] powers, who are respected in society, particularly for their ability to perform [[divination]]. The [[Dictionary of the Irish Language]] defines ''druí'' (which has numerous variant forms, including ''draoi'') as 'magician, wizard or diviner'.&lt;ref name="eDILdrui"&gt;{{cite web |last1=|first1= |title=Drui |url=http://edil.qub.ac.uk/advanced_search?q=dru%C3%AD&amp;search_in=headword#search_results |website=[[Dictionary of the Irish Language]] (eDIL) |publisher=[[Royal Irish Academy]] (RIA)|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the literature the druids cast spells and turn people into animals or stones, or curse peoples’ crops to be blighted.

When druids are portrayed in early Irish sagas and saints' lives set in the pre-Christian past of the island, they are usually accorded high social status. The evidence of the law-texts, which were first written down in the 7th and 8th centuries, suggests that with the coming of Christianity the role of the druid in Irish society was rapidly reduced to that of a sorcerer who could be consulted to cast spells or practise healing magic and that his standing declined accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Guide to Early Irish Law'', pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the early legal tract ''Bretha Crólige'', the sick-maintenance due to a druid, satirist and brigand (''díberg'') is no more than that due to a ''[[bóaire]]'' (an ordinary freeman). Another law-text, ''[[Uraicecht Becc]]'' (‘Small primer’), gives the druid a place among the ''dóer-nemed'' or professional classes which depend for their status on a patron, along with wrights, blacksmiths and entertainers, as opposed to the ''[[fili]]'', who alone enjoyed free ''nemed''-status.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Guide to Early Irish Law'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Welsh literature ====
While druids featured prominently in many medieval Irish sources, they were far rarer in their Welsh counterparts. Unlike the Irish texts, the Welsh term commonly seen as referring to the druids, ''{{lang|cy|dryw}}'', was used to refer purely to [[prophet]]s and not to sorcerers or pagan priests. Historian [[Ronald Hutton]] noted that there were two explanations for the use of the term in Wales: the first was that it was a survival from the pre-Christian era, when ''dryw'' had been ancient priests, while the second was that the Welsh had borrowed the term from the Irish, as had the English (who used the terms ''dry'' and ''drycraeft'' to refer to magicians and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] respectively, most probably influenced by the Irish terms.)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the historian Jane Webster stated, "individual druids... are unlikely to be identified archaeologically".&lt;ref&gt;Webster 1999:6.&lt;/ref&gt; A.P. Fitzpatrick, in examining what he believed to be astral symbolism on Late Iron Age swords has expressed difficulties in relating any material culture, even the [[Coligny calendar]], with druidic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fitzpatrick, A.P. | year = 1996 | title = Night and Day: the symbolism of astral signs on Late Iron Age anthropomorphic short swords | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 373–98 | doi=10.1017/s0079497x0000284x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, some archaeologists have attempted to link certain discoveries with written accounts of the druids. The archaeologist Anne Ross linked what she believed to be evidence of [[human sacrifice]] in Celtic pagan society—such as the [[Lindow Man]] bog body—to the Greco-Roman accounts of human sacrifice being officiated over by the druids.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Ross (1986). "[[Lindow Man]] and the Celtic tradition", in ''Lindow Man; The Body in the Bog'' (eds: I.M. Stead, J.B. Bourke and D. Brothwell), pp. 162–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Ross and Don Robins (1989) ''The Life and Death of a Druid Prince''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miranda Aldhouse-Green]], professor of archaeology at Cardiff University has noted that Suetonius's army would have passed very near the site whilst traveling to deal with [[Boudicca]] and postulates that the sacrifice may have been connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mqq94|title=The Druids|date=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An excavated burial in [[Deal, Kent]] discovered the "Deal warrior" ~  a man buried around 200–150 BCE with a sword and shield, and wearing a unique crown, too thin to be a helmet. The crown is bronze with a broad band around the head and a thin strip crossing the top of the head. It was worn without any padding beneath, as traces of hair were left on the metal. The form of the crown is similar to that seen in images of Romano-British priests several centuries later, leading to speculation among archaeologists that the man might have been a druid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/skull-and-crown-of-the-deal-warrior/2QEkL6eclOrqpw British Museum Highlights, Skull and crown of the 'Deal Warrior']&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of reception ==

=== Prohibition and decline under Roman rule ===
During the [[Gallic Wars]] of 58 to 51 BCE, the Roman army, led by [[Julius Caesar]], conquered the many tribal chiefdoms of Gaul, and annexed it as a part of the [[Roman Republic]]. According to accounts produced in the following centuries, the new rulers of [[Roman Gaul]] subsequently introduced measures to wipe out the druids from that country. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], writing in the 70s CE, it was the emperor [[Tiberius]] (who ruled from 14 to 37 CE), who introduced laws banning not only druid practices, but also other native soothsayers and healers, a move which Pliny applauded, believing that it would end human sacrifice in Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pli|Pliny]]. XXX.13.&lt;/ref&gt; A somewhat different account of Roman legal attacks on the druids was made by [[Suetonius]], writing in the 2nd century CE, when he claimed that Rome's first emperor, [[Augustus]] (who had ruled from 27 BCE till 14 CE), had decreed that no-one could be both a druid and a Roman citizen, and that this was followed by a law passed by the later Emperor [[Claudius]] (who had ruled from 41 to 54 CE) which "thoroughly suppressed" the druids by banning their religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]]. ''Claudius''. XXV.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible late survival of Insular druid orders ===
{{Further information|Christianization of Ireland|Christianization of Wales|Taliesin}}
The best evidence of a druidic tradition in the [[British Isles]] is the independent cognate of the [[proto-Celtic language|Celtic]] ''*druwid-'' in [[Insular Celtic]]: The Old Irish ''druídecht'' survives in the meaning of 'magic', and the Welsh ''dryw'' in the meaning of 'seer'.

While the druids as a priestly caste were extinct with the [[Christianization of Wales]], complete by the 7th century at the latest, the offices of [[bard]] and of "seer" ({{lang-cy|dryw}}) persisted in [[Wales in the High Middle Ages|medieval Wales]] into the 13th century.

Phillip Freeman, a classics professor, discusses a later reference to 'dryades', which he translates as 'druidesses', writing that "The fourth century A.D. collection of imperial biographies known as the [[Historia Augusta]] contains three short passages involving Gaulish women called 'dryades' ('druidesses'). He points out that "In all of these, the women may not be direct heirs of the druids who were supposedly extinguished by the Romans&amp;nbsp;— but in any case they do show that the druidic function of prophesy continued among the natives in Roman Gaul."&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Phillip, ''War, Women &amp; Druids: Eyewitness Reports and Early Accounts'', University of Texas Press, {{ISBN|978-0-292-72545-4}}, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Historia Augusta]] is frequently interpreted by scholars as a largely satirical work, and such details might have been introduced in a humorous fashion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Additionally, female druids are mentioned in later Irish mythology, including the legend of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]], who, according to the 12th century ''[[The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn]]'', is raised by the woman druid [[Bodhmall]] and her companion, another wise-woman.&lt;ref name="maryjones.us"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parkes 2004 pp. 587"/&gt;

=== Christian historiography and hagiography ===
The story of [[Vortigern]], as reported by [[Nennius]], provides one of the very few glimpses of possible druidic survival in Britain after the Roman conquest: unfortunately, Nennius is noted for mixing fact and legend in such a way that it is now impossible to know the truth behind his text. He wrote that after being excommunicated by [[Germain of Auxerre|Germanus]], the British leader Vortigern invited twelve druids to assist him.

In the lives of saints and martyrs, the druids are represented as magicians and diviners. In [[Adamnan]]'s ''vita'' of Columba, two of them act as tutors to the daughters of [[Lóegaire mac Néill]], the [[High King of Ireland]], at the coming of [[Saint Patrick]]. They are represented as endeavouring to prevent the progress of Patrick and [[Saint Columba]] by raising clouds and mist. Before the battle of Culdremne (561) a druid made an ''airbe drtiad'' ("fence of protection"?) round one of the armies, but what is precisely meant by the phrase is unclear. The Irish druids seem to have had a peculiar tonsure. The word ''druí'' is always used to render the [[Latin]] ''magus'', and in one passage St Columba speaks of Christ as his druid. Similarly, a life of St [[Beuno]] states that when he died he had a vision of 'all the saints and druids'.

[[Sulpicius Severus]]' ''Vita'' of [[Martin of Tours]] relates how Martin encountered a peasant funeral, carrying the body in a winding sheet, which Martin mistook for some druidic rites of [[sacrifice]], "because it was the custom of the Gallic rustics in their wretched folly to carry about through the fields the images of [[demon]]s veiled with a white covering." So Martin halted the procession by raising his pectoral cross: "Upon this, the miserable creatures might have been seen at first to become stiff like rocks. Next, as they endeavoured, with every possible effort, to move forward, but were not able to take a step farther, they began to whirl themselves about in the most ridiculous fashion, until, not able any longer to sustain the weight, they set down the dead body." Then discovering his error, Martin raised his hand again to let them proceed: "Thus," the hagiographer points out, "he both compelled them to stand when he pleased, and permitted them to depart when he thought good."&lt;ref name="Hagiogr"&gt;[http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~eknuth/npnf2-11/sulpitiu/lifeofst.html#tp Hagiography]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romanticism and later revivals ===
{{Main article|Celtic revival|Neo-Druidism}}
[[File:Croome Park Worcs HeSn Druid statue 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Croome Park]]: Druid statue]]
From the 18th century, England and Wales experienced a revival of interest in the druids. [[John Aubrey]] (1626–1697) had been the first modern writer to (incorrectly) connect [[Stonehenge]] and other [[megalith]]ic monuments with the druids; since Aubrey's views were confined to his notebooks, the first wide audience for this idea were readers of [[William Stukeley]] (1687–1765).&lt;ref&gt;The modern career of this imagined connection of druids and Stonehenge was traced and dispelled in [[T. D. Kendrick]], ''The Druids: A Study in Keltic Prehistory'' (London: Methuen) 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; It is incorrectly believed that [[John Toland]] (1670–1722) founded the [[Ancient Druid Order]] however the research of historian [[Ronald Hutton]] has revealed that the ADO was founded by George Watson MacGregor Reid in 1909.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The order never used (and still does not use) the title "ArchDruid" for any member, but falsely credited [[William Blake]] as having been its "Chosen Chief" from 1799 to 1827, without corroboration in Blake's numerous writings or among modern Blake scholars. Blake's bardic mysticism derives instead from the pseudo-[[Ossian]]ic epics of Macpherson; his friend Frederick Tatham's depiction of Blake's imagination, "clothing itself in the dark stole of moral sanctity"— in the precincts of Westminster Abbey— "it dwelt amid the druid terrors", is generic rather than specifically neo-druidic.&lt;ref&gt;Tatham is quoted by C. H. Collins Baker, "William Blake, Painter", ''The Huntington Library Bulletin'', No. 10 [October 1936:135-148] p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Toland]] was fascinated by Aubrey's Stonehenge theories, and wrote his own book about the monument without crediting Aubrey. The roles of [[bards]] in 10th century Wales had been established by [[Hywel Dda]] and it was during the 18th century that the idea arose that druids had been their predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1937/ "Ancient Druids of Wales", National Museum of Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century idea, gained from uncritical reading of the ''[[Gallic Wars]]'', that under cultural-military pressure from Rome the druids formed the core of 1st-century BCE resistance among the [[Gauls]], was examined and dismissed before World War II,&lt;ref&gt;Norman J. DeWitt, "The Druids and Romanization" ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' '''69''' (1938:319–332): "Few historians now believe that the Druids, as a corporation, constituted an effective anti-Roman element during the period of Caesar's conquests and in the period of early [[Roman Gaul]];" his inspection of the seemingly contradictory literary sources reinforced the stated conclusion.&lt;/ref&gt; though it remains current in folk history.

Druids began to figure widely in popular culture with the first advent of [[Romanticism]]. [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]]'s novel ''Les Martyrs'' (1809) narrated the doomed love of a druid priestess and a Roman soldier; though Chateaubriand's theme was the triumph of Christianity over pagan druids, the setting was to continue to bear fruit. [[Opera]] provides a barometer of well-informed popular European culture in the early 19th century: in 1817 [[Giovanni Pacini]] brought druids to the stage in [[Trieste]] with an opera to a libretto by [[Felice Romani]] about a druid priestess, ''La Sacerdotessa d'Irminsul'' ("The Priestess of [[Irminsul]]"). The most famous druidic opera, [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' was a fiasco at [[La Scala]], when it premiered the day after Christmas, 1831; but in 1833 it was a hit in London. For its libretto, [[Felice Romani]] reused some of the pseudo-druidical background of ''La Sacerdotessa'' to provide colour to a standard theatrical conflict of love and duty. The story was similar to that of [[Medea]], as it had recently been recast for a popular Parisian play by [[Alexandre Soumet]]: the chaste goddess (''casta diva'') addressed in ''Norma'''s hit aria is the moon goddess, worshipped in the "grove of the [[Irminenschaft|Irmin]] statue".

[[File:Iolomorganwg.jpg|thumb|Edward Williams, known for his bardic name; Iolo Morganwg]] A central figure in 19th century Romanticist, Neo-druid revival, is the Welshman Edward Williams, better known as [[Iolo Morganwg]]. His writings, published posthumously as ''The Iolo Manuscripts'' (1849) and ''Barddas'' (1862), are not considered credible by contemporary scholars. Williams claimed to have collected ancient knowledge in a "[[Gorsedd]] of Bards of the Isles of Britain" he had organized. Many scholars deem part or all of Williams's work to be fabrication, and purportedly many of the documents are of his own fabrication, but a large portion of the work has indeed been collected from meso-pagan sources dating from as far back as 600 CE.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Regardless, it has become impossible to separate the original source material from the fabricated work, and while bits and pieces of the ''Barddas'' still turn up in some "[[Neo-Druidism|Neo-Druidic]]" works, the documents are considered irrelevant by most scholars.

Another Welshman, [[William Price (physician)|William Price]] (4 March 1800 – 23 January 1893), a physician known for his support of Welsh nationalism, Chartism, and his involvement with the Neo-Druidic religious movement, has been recognised as a significant figures of 19th-century Wales.  He was arrested for cremating his deceased son, a practice he believed to be a druid ritual, but won his case; this in turn led to the 1902 cremation act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=1&amp;coll_id=669&amp;expand= |title=Price, William, Dr, (Llantrisant), papers |accessdate=2006-09-27 |date=May 2003 |publisher=Archives Network Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell 2005. p. 03"&gt;[[#Pow05|Powell 2005]]. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton 2009. p. 253"&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927 [[T. D. Kendrick]] sought to dispel the pseudo-historical aura that had accrued to druids,&lt;ref&gt;[[T. D. Kendrick]], ''The Druids: A Study in Keltic Prehistory'' (London: Methuen) 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; asserting that "a prodigious amount of rubbish has been written about Druidism";&lt;ref&gt;Kendrick 1927:viii.&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-druidism has nevertheless continued to shape public perceptions of the historical druids.

Some strands of contemporary Neo-Druidism are a continuation of the 18th-century revival and thus are built largely around writings produced in the 18th century and after by second-hand sources and theorists. Some are [[monotheism|monotheistic]]. Others, such as the largest druid group in the world, The [[Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids]] draw on a wide range of sources for their teachings. Members of such Neo-Druid groups may be [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]], [[occultist]], Christian or non-specifically spiritual.

=== Modern scholarship ===
In the 20th century, as new forms of textual criticism and archaeological methods were developed, allowing for greater accuracy in understanding the past, various historians and archaeologists published books on the subject of the druids and came to their own conclusions. The archaeologist [[Stuart Piggott]], author of ''The Druids'' (1968), accepted the Greco-Roman accounts and considered the druids to be a barbaric and savage priesthood who performed human sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pig68|Piggott 1968]]. pp. 92–98.&lt;/ref&gt; This view was largely supported by another archaeologist, Anne Ross, author of ''Pagan Celtic Britain'' (1967) and ''The Life and Death of a Druid Prince'' (1989), although she believed that they were essentially tribal priests, having more in common with the [[shamans]] of tribal societies than with the classical philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ros67|Ross 1967]]. pp. 52–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Ross' views were largely accepted by two other prominent archaeologists to write on the subject, [[Miranda Aldhouse-Green]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ald97|Aldhouse-Green 1997]]. pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt;—author of ''The Gods of the Celts'' (1986), ''Exploring the World of the Druids'' (1997) and ''Caesar's Druids: Story of an Ancient Priesthood'' (2010)—and [[Barry Cunliffe]], author of ''Iron Age Communities in Britain'' (1991) and ''The Ancient Celts'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cun05|Cunliffe 2005]]. pp. 518–520.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Echinocereus''''' is a [[genus]] of ribbed, usually small to medium-sized [[cylindrical]] [[cactus|cacti]], comprising about 70 [[species]] [[native plant|native]] to the southern United States and Mexico in very sunny rocky places. Usually the [[flower]]s are large and the [[fruit]] edible.

The name comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ἐχῖνος (''echinos''), meaning "hedgehog," and the [[Latin]] ''cereus'' meaning "candle." They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti,&lt;ref name="ITIS"&gt;{{ITIS |id=19803 |taxon=''Echinocereus'' |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term also used for the ''[[Pediocactus]]'' and ''[[Echinopsis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cssaustralia.org.au/content/view/72/104/ |title=Echinopsis (Hedgehog Cacti) |accessdate=2008-07-29 |publisher=Cactus and Succulent Society of Australia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720010527/http://cssaustralia.org.au/content/view/72/104/ |archivedate=2008-07-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Echinocereus'' are bushy and globular with tight spines which are often colorful and decorative. The flowers last slightly longer than those of other cacti.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Cultivation==
''Echinocereus'' is easier to cultivate than many other cacti.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} They need a light soil, a sunny exposure, a fresh and dry winter to flower. They like a soil slightly richer than other cacti. In the wild, several of the species are [[Hardiness (plants)|cold-hardy]], tolerating temperatures as low as -23&amp;nbsp;°C but only in dry conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2468">'''Edward Anwyl''' (1786–1857) was a Welsh [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] minister and school teacher. 

==Early life==
Born in April 1786 at Ty'nllan, [[Llanegryn]], [[Merionethshire]], his parents were Ann and Owen Anwyl.&lt;ref name="Rees"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Mardy Rees|title=Notable Welshmen (1700-1900): ... with Brief Notes, in Chronological Order, and Authorities.

He attended the school in his hometown until he was about 12 years of age, when he became a farm laborer&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt; because his father was dying. From that point, he continued his studies on his own.&lt;ref name="Rowland"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Helen Rowland|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Welshmen who Flourished from 1700 to 1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PXM_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA2|year=1907|publisher=The authoress|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
Griffith Hughes of the Wesleyans came to town in 1804 and he joined the church two years later. Anwyl was ordained in 1808.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7577">Within the guidelines of '''[[halacha]]''', as presented by ''[[chazal]]'' and [[rishonim|early]] rabbinic authorities,''' [[fellatio]] '''is classified as ביאה דרך איברים (penetration by way of the limbs) or מעשה חידודים בעלמא (general acts of sharpening).

Peripheral halachic discussion of the topic revolves upon whether or not a husband may engage in varying sexually-gratifying acts with his wife – including fellatio – performed up to and including a complete extra-vaginal ejaculation.

The discussion includes the opinion of the permitting authorities limiting their permit to specific frequencies and timings, the consensus being that any halachic-permit ("''hetter''") is solely applicable within the exclusive framework of a [[Torah Laws|Torah]]-permitted marital relationship and strictly during the time that one's wife is not in her ''[[niddah]]'' state.

==Rambam==
The original Hebrew text of the ''[[Mishnah Torah]]'' of the [[Rambam]], as translated by [[Yosef Qafih]], shows the Rambam takes a lenient approach that permits all that a man desires to do with his wife. The presentation omits the customary [[Prohibition of extracting semen in vain (Judaism)|prohibition on extracting semen in vain]], which Qafih quarantines as an addition by a subsequent unknown editor. The Rambam's commentary to the [[Mishnah]] likewise hints at a lenient stance.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Mishna commentary to [[Tractate Sanhedrin]] [[s:he:רמב"ם על סנהדרין ז#משנה ד|7:4]] (..כל מה שרוצה לעשות באשתו עושה לפי שהענין..האסור והמותר אינן בענין המרוחק והשנוא והמרוצה והאהוב ומה שראוי לעשות מדרך הצניעות  ותכלית הפרישות)&lt;/ref&gt;

== On occasion ==

[[Chazal]] have in certain instances permitted intentional extra-vaginal ejaculation in tandem with one's wife.&lt;ref&gt;The [[tannaim]] [[Rabbi Eliezer]] and [[Rabbi Meir]] ([[Tosefta]], Niddah 2:), for safety reasons (prior to the advent of female [[birth control]]) permits exterior ejaculation for a duration of 24 months post childbirth (Talmud Yebamoth 34).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tosefot]] cites the opinion of Rabbi Yitzchak ([[Isaac ben Samuel]]) who permits an occasional complete extra-vaginal ejaculation with one's wife on condition that one does not accustom himself to ''always'' doing so (Tosfoth, [[Yebamot]]h [[s:he:יבמות לד ב#תוספות|34b]]; Tosfoth, [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] [[s:he:סנהדרין נח ב#תוספות|58b]]). The ''Bayit Chadash'' ([[Yoel Sirkis]]) commentary to the [[Rabbeinu Asher]] (ibid.) explicitly permits this foreign ejaculation with Rabbeinu Asher siding with the Tosafist opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbeinu Asher to Yebamoth ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion is likewise quoted in ''[[Tur Shulchan Aruch]]'', ''[[Even Ha'ezer]]'' ch. 25.

The ''Bayis Chodosh'' sourced his views based on the Talmudic tract of Yebamoth;

{{Quote|It isn't comparable to the action of Er and Onan only if one is accustomed to doing so all the time, but if it is performed on occasion when he desire his wife for non-vaginal relations—it is permitted ...as whatever a man desires to do with his wife he may as per the (''chazalic'') parable of meat that is acquired from the butcher and fish from the fisherman (Tractate [[Nedarim (tractate)|Nedarim]], [[s:he:נדרים כ ב|20b]])|Hagahot HaBach to Tractate Yebamoth 34b}}

Thus Rabbenu Asher, followed by Rabbi [[Elijah Spira]], commented that an occasional exterior ejaculation in tandem with one's wife is not considered "extracting semen in vain" (and not banned by the Talmud) as long as the intention is not to avoid impregnating one's wife ''and'' it is done on occasion, as this is not likened to the desire of [[Onan]] who wished to avoid impregnating [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] entirely.&lt;ref&gt;"Eliyah rabbah" to ch. 240 of Orach Chayim, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Aguddah]]'' work also sides with the lenient opinion permitting an occasional extra-vaginal ejaculation with one's wife,&lt;ref&gt;Agudah, p. 115 col. 2&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Rabbi Samuel Eidels (the [[Maharsha]]) likewise taking a lenient view.&lt;ref&gt;Maharsha to Talmud Nedarim 20a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parable of meat and fish==
In a varying text of [[Minor tractate|Kallah Rabthi]] as printed by Rabbi [[Solomon Aaron Wertheimer]] in "''Battei Medrashoth''",&lt;ref&gt;of the Cairo geniza: http://www.hebrewbooks.org/21179 vol. 1 p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Werthheimer notes the significance of the Talmud quoting both meat and fish in its parable depicting the enhanced permissiveness of sexually gratifying activities that one may perform with his wife;

Since the Torah forbids [[Milk and meat in Jewish law|cooking one's meat in milk]], a parable quoting just meat would not suffice as meat has this restrictive element whereas fish has a lesser restrictive element, thus implying that man has an enhanced level of (sexual) freedom with his wife.

==As often as needed==
A more explicit permissive stance is that of the tosafist rabbi [[Isaiah di Trani|Isaiah di Trani the Elder]] who hints that a complete extra-vaginal ejaculation is permitted whenever needed to "seat" one's desire with the stark exclusion being to avoid pregnancy;

{{Quote|What was the (forbidden) action of Er and Onan that the torah prohibits? that committed with the intent of not diminishing her beauty (due to pregnancy) and he doesn't desire to fulfill the [[mitzvah]] of procreation (פרו ורבו) with her. But if his intent.. is for his inclination and to satisfy his desire and his intent is not to avoid impregnating her, it is permitted, ..he whose intent is to fulfill the desire of his inclination does not transgress as "all that a man wants to do with his wife he may do" (Tractate Nedarim, 20b) -and this isn't called "wasting his seed"|Tosfoth Ri"d to Tractate Yebamoth, p. 12b (Yad HaRav Herzog, Jerusalem)}}

Rabbi Isaiah the Elder's view is likewise echoed by his descendant, Rabbi [[Isaiah di Trani the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ria"z", jerusalem 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Eleazar of Worms]], in his recently published Torah commentary to the verse "Adam and his wife, and where not embarrassed" (Genesis) permits any activity with one's wife necessary to "quiet (lit. seat)" his desire.&lt;ref&gt;Rokeach to the Torah (J. Kluggman, Bnei Brak), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active participation===
Later rabbinic authorities differentiated between masturbation (self-extracting semen in vain) and an extra-vaginal ejaculation achieved with the active participation of one's Torah-permitted partner - with the former being forbidden under most if not all circumstances. Apparently, any halachic permit for an extra-vaginal ejaculation must be accompanied by the active participation of one's wife.

From among rabbis of the [[achronim]] era, the [[Tzemach Tzedek]] differentiated between extracting one's seed alone ("masturbation upon trees and stones") and extra-vaginal extracting of one's semen with the active participation of one's wife, with the latter classified as a form of a tandem relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Responsa, ch. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Commandment''' (or '''Greatest Commandment''')&lt;ref&gt;Although most English versions of the Bible use the word "great", (from the Greek feminine ''μεγάλη'' big, great) a few versions change the word to "greatest". See [http://studybible.info/compare/Matthew%2022:36 multi-version comparison of Matthew 22:36.]&lt;/ref&gt; is a name used in the [[New Testament]] to describe the first of two commandments cited by [[Jesus]] in {{bibleref2|Matthew|22:35-40|9|Matthew 22:35–40}} and {{bibleref2|Mark|12:28-34|9|Mark 12:28–34}}. These two commandments are [[paraphrase]]s taken from the [[Old Testament]] and are commonly seen as important to [[Jewish ethics|Jewish]] and [[Christian ethics]].

In Mark, when asked "which is the great commandment in the law?", the [[Greek New Testament]] reports that Jesus answered, "[[Shema Yisrael|Hear, O Israel!]] [[The Lord]] our God, The Lord is One; Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind",&lt;ref name="OrigShema"&gt;({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|6:4–9|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|11:13-21|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Numbers|15:37–41|HE}})&lt;/ref&gt; before also referring to a second commandment, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."&lt;ref name="brotherly love"&gt;({{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:18|126}})&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Christian denomination]]s consider these two commandments to be the core of correct [[Christianity|Christian]] lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Catholicity"&gt;[http://www.catholicity.com/baltimore-catechism/lesson15.html Catholicity] &amp;ndash; [http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment LDS] &amp;ndash; [http://www.greatbiblestudy.com/two_commandments.php GreatBibleStudy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament accounts==

===Gospel of Matthew===
{{Quote|And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.”|{{bibleref2|Matthew| 22:35-40|ESV}}}}

===Gospel of Mark===
In the Gospel of Mark, the [[Shema Yisrael|Shema]] is included:
{{Quote|
And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”|{{bibleref2|Mark|12:28-31|ESV}}}}

===Gospel of Luke===
{{Quote|
And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” He said to him, “What is written in the Law? How do you read it?” And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.”  And he said to him, “You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.|
{{bibleref2|Luke|10:25-28|ESV}}}}

===Gospel of John===
{{Quote|
When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.' A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”|
{{bibleref2|John|13:31-35|ESV}}}}

==Old Testament references==
===Deuteronomy===
{{Quote|Hear, O Israel: The {{LORD}} our God ''is'' one {{LORD}}:
And thou shalt love the {{LORD}} thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.|{{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|6:4-5|KJV}}}}

===Leviticus===
{{Quote|&lt;sup&gt;17[a]&lt;/sup&gt; You must not hate your brother in your heart. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;17[b]&lt;/sup&gt; You must surely reprove your fellow citizen &lt;br /&gt; &lt;sup&gt;17[c]&lt;/sup&gt; so that you do not incur sin on account of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18[a] &lt;/sup&gt;You must not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the children of your people, &lt;br /&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[18b]&lt;/sup&gt; but you must love your neighbor as yourself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[18c]&lt;/sup&gt; I am the {{LORD}}.|{{bibleref2|Leviticus|19:17-18|NET}}}}

==Love the Lord thy God==
{{See also|Agape|Love of God (Christianity)}}
[[Matthew Henry]] sums up the question of which is the great commandment:
{{quote|It was a question disputed among the critics in the [[Law of Moses|Law]]. Some would have the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Law of Circumcision]] to be the Great Commandment, others the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Law of the Sabbath]], others the [[Korban#In Christianity|Law of Sacrifices]], according as they severally stood affected, and spent their zeal; now they would try what Christ said to this question, hoping to incense the people against him, if he should not answer according to the vulgar opinion; and if he should magnify one commandment, they would reflect on him as [[antinomianism|vilifying the rest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mhcw.biblecommenter.com/matthew/22.htm |title=Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible - Matthew 22 |publisher=Mhcw.biblecommenter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311054726/http://mhcw.biblecommenter.com/matthew/22.htm |archivedate=2013-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Adam Clarke]], in his ''Commentary on the Bible'', wrote:
{{quote|This is the first and great commandment. It is "first and greatest":
#In its ''antiquity''; being as old as the world, and engraved originally on our very nature.
#In its ''dignity''; as directly and immediately proceeding from and referring to God.
#In its ''excellence''; being the commandment of the new covenant, and the very spirit of the Divine adoption.
#In its ''justice''; because it alone renders to God his due, prefers him before all things, and secures to him his proper rank in relation to them.
#In its ''sufficiency''; being in itself capable of making men holy in this life, and happy in the other.
#In its ''fruitfulness''; because it is the root of all commandments, and the fulfilling of the law.
#In its ''virtue and efficacy''; because by this alone God reigns in the heart of humans, and humans are united to God.
#In its ''extent''; leaving nothing to the creature, which it does not refer to the Creator.
#In its ''necessity''; being absolutely indispensable.
#In its ''duration''; being ever to be continued on earth, and never to be discontinued in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Clarke, Commentary on the Bible [http://clarke.biblecommenter.com/matthew/22.htm Adam Clarke 1831 Commentary on the Bible - Matthew 22] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829024635/http://clarke.biblecommenter.com/matthew/22.htm |date=2011-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God" is explained to mean "Act in such a manner that God will be beloved by all His creatures."&lt;ref&gt;Sifre, Deut. 32; Yoma 86a&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, [[Israelites|Israel]], being, as the priest-people, enjoined like the [[Kohen|Aaronite priest]] to sanctify the [[JHWH|name of God]] and avoid whatever tends to desecrate it (Lev. xxii. 32), is not only obliged to give his life as witness or martyr for the maintenance of the true faith (see Isa. xliii. 12, μάρτυρες; and Pesik. 102b; Sifra, Emor, ix.), but so to conduct himself in every way as to prevent the name of God from being dishonored by non-Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=499&amp;letter=E |title=Ethics |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twice every day the Jew recites the ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'', which contains the words: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might" (Deut. vi. 5). This verse is understood to enjoin him to willingly surrender life and fortune whenever the cause of God demands it, while it at the same time urges him to make God beloved by all his creatures through deeds of kindness, as [[Abraham]] did (Sifre, Deut. 32).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=666&amp;letter=J&amp;search= |title=Judaism |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although only asked about the first commandment, Jesus included the second commandment in his answer. This double reference has given rise to differing views with regard to the relationship that exists between the two commandments, although typically "love thy God" is referred to as "the first and greatest commandment", with "love thy neighbour" being referred to as "the second great commandment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.catholicweb.com/4Immaculateconception/index.cfm/NewsItem?ID=288819&amp;From=Home |title=catholicweb.com |publisher=Home.catholicweb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408082856/http://home.catholicweb.com/4Immaculateconception/index.cfm/NewsItem?ID=288819&amp;From=Home |archivedate=2013-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may simply reflect the "[[Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael|seven rules (Middot) of Hillel]]", in this case the first one, called [[A minore ad maius|Ḳal wa-ḥomer]] (Hebrew: קל וחומר).

==Love thy neighbour as thyself==
{{Main|Golden Rule}}
When asked which is the greatest commandment, the ''Christian New Testament'' depicts Jesus paraphrasing the [[Torah]]: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind," before also paraphrasing a second passage; "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Most Christian denominations view these two commandments as, together, forming the core of the Christian religion. The second passage is considered to be a form of the [[Golden Rule#Christianity|Golden Rule]] (circa 1300 BCE).&lt;ref name="Plaut pp.892"&gt;[[Gunther Plaut|Plaut]], ''The Torah&amp;nbsp;— A Modern Commentary''; Union of American Hebrew Congregations, New York 1981; pp.892.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The priesthood of Amun rose in power during the early Eighteenth dynasty through significant tributes to the god Amun by ruler such as [[Hatshepsut]] and more importantly [[Thutmose III]].&lt;ref&gt;Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, vol. 2: The Eighteenth Dynasty&lt;/ref&gt; The Amun priesthood in Thebes had four high-ranking priests:&lt;ref&gt;Dodson, Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Chief Prophet of Amun at Karnak (''ḥm nṯr tpj n jmn''), also referred to as the Chief Priest of Amun.
* The [[Second Prophet of Amun]] at Karnak (''ḥm nṯr snnw n jmn''), also referred to as the Second Priest of Amun.
* The Third Prophet of Amun at Karnak (''ḥm nṯr ḫmtnw n jmn khemet-nu''), also referred to as the Third Priest of Amun.
* The Fourth Priest of Amun at Karnak (''ḥm nṯr jfdw n jmn''), also referred to as the Fourth Priest of Amun.

The power of the Amun priesthood was temporarily curtailed during the Amarna period. A high priest named Maya is recorded in year 4 of [[Akhenaten]]. Akhenaten has the name of Amun removed from monuments during his reign as well as the names of several other deities. After his death, Amun was restored to his place of prominence among the cults in Egypt. The young pharaoh Tutankhaten changed his name to [[Tutankhamun]] to signal the restoration of the Amun to his former place of prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Aldred, Akhenaten: King of Egypt, Thames &amp; Hudson  (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theban High Priest of Amun was appointed by the King. It was not uncommon for the position to be held by dignitaries who held additional posts in the pharaoh's administration. Several of the high priests from the time of [[Ramesses II]] also served as Vizier.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, Ramesside Inscriptions, Translated &amp; Annotated, Translations, Volume III, Blackwell Publishers, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the New Kingdom, the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] priesthood of Amun is for a large part dominated by Ramessesnakht. His son, Amenhotep, eventually succeeded his father and found himself in conflict with the Viceroy of Kush, [[Panehesy]]. Panehesy took his troops north and besieged Thebes. After this period, generals by the name of [[Herihor]] and [[Piye]] served as High Priest.

[[File:Herihor.jpg|thumb|left|Herihor]]
By the time Herihor was proclaimed as the first ruling High Priest of Amun in 1080 BC—in the 19th Year of [[Ramesses XI]]—the Amun priesthood exercised an effective stranglehold on Egypt's economy. The Amun priests owned two-thirds of all the temple lands in Egypt and 90 percent of her ships plus many other resources.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Clayton, Chronicle of the Pharaohs, Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd., 1994. p.175&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Amun priests were as powerful as Pharaoh, if not more so. The '''High Priests of Amun''' at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] from the 21st dynasty were of such power and influence that they were effectively the rulers of Upper Egypt from 1080 to c. 943 BC. They are however not regarded as a ruling dynasty with pharaonic prerogatives, and after this period the influence of the Amun priesthood declined.  One of the sons of the High Priest, [[Pinedjem I]], would eventually assume the throne and rule Egypt for almost half-a-decade as pharaoh [[Psusennes I]] while the Theban High Priest Psusennes III would take the throne as king [[Psusennes II]]—the final ruler of the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first Dynasty]].

{{Ancient Egyptian religion}}
'''Kemetic Orthodoxy''' is a modern religious sect based on [[Kemeticism]], which is a reconstruction of [[ancient Egyptian religion]].&lt;ref name="What is" /&gt; It was founded in 1988 by [[Tamara Siuda]], who remains its current Nisut or Pharaoh.&lt;ref name="Nisut"&gt;[http://www.kemet.org/taxonomy/term/12 Nisut | Kemet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NisutBiography"&gt;[http://www.kemet.org/nisut-biography Rev. Tamara L. Siuda | Kemet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://doi.org/10.2307/3712405 Kemetic Orthodoxy] does not follow a single [[scripture]], but rather a fluid understanding of balance, justice and truth. Worship often takes place in shrines, which exist in both public and personal forms.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Five basic tenets guide the faith of members: Belief in upholding [[Ma'at#Ma'at as a principle|ma'at]], Belief in [[Netjer]] (the supreme being), Akhu (Ancestor) Veneration, Participation in and Respect for the Community, and Acknowledgment of Siuda as the Nisut.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Members of the faith are known as "Shemsu".&lt;ref name="Join"&gt;[http://www.kemet.org/join Membership | Kemet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main temple is in [[Joliet, Illinois]],&lt;ref name="TawyHouse"&gt;[http://tawyhouse.org/ Tawy House Kemetic Orthodox Retreat &amp; Conference Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; with a variety of state shrines maintained by priests throughout the world.&lt;ref name="TemplesShrines"&gt;[http://www.kemet.org/shrines Temples and Shrines | Kemet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main beliefs==
[[Image:Ankh.svg|thumb|150px|The [[Ankh]] is a Kemetic symbol of eternal life in both antiquity and modern times.]]
Kemetic Orthodoxy claims to be based on the religious practices of [[Ancient Egyptian Religion|Ancient Egypt]].  However, it is not a [[Polytheistic Reconstructionism|reconstructionist religion]], but an ever-evolving religion that combines ancient and modern practices to create a modern religion.&lt;ref name="What is"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Kemetic Orthodoxy?: Introduction |url=http://www.kemet.org/about |publisher=The House of Netjer |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has five principal [[wikt:tenet|tenet]]s, often described as four main tenets held together by a fundamental belief in upholding [[Ma'at#Ma'at as a principle|ma'at]]. The organisation does not consider these tenets as [[dogma]]. Instead, they report that these form the basis of what most members of Kemetic Orthodoxy believe, but what each individual member believes may vary. The religion does not require that all members practice in exactly the same way, and different views are looked upon as merely different ways of understanding God, or Netjer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Belief in upholding ma'at===
In the [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], [[Ma'at]] is believed to be both a goddess and the force that keeps the world balanced. In Kemetic Orthodoxy, Ma'at is considered to be both a Name of Netjer (manifestation of God) and an abstract concept of balance, justice and truth. Members of Kemetic Orthodoxy believe that this standard must be upheld in all daily life. This includes not being deliberately harmful to any person as well as being kind to one's self, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kemet.org/taxonomy/term/28 Ma'at | Kemet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief in Netjer (the supreme being)===
One belief central to Kemetic Orthodoxy is the belief in [[Netjer]], the supreme [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] of Kemetic Orthodoxy, and its "Names", the commonly recognized [[Egyptian pantheon#List of deities of Ancient Egypt|gods of ancient Egypt]]. These gods and goddesses, commonly called Names of Netjer, manifest in various forms and have various names, e.g. [[Anpu]], [[Isis|Aset]], etc. Followers of Kemetic Orthodoxy usually refer to Netjer using these various Names, and believe that such gods are merely different aspects of the one supreme [[God]], which has multiple names.&lt;ref name="What is"/&gt; Therefore, the teachings of Kemetic Orthodoxy can be considered an [[Inclusive monotheism]] as opposed to [[Monolatry]], as the existence of other Gods is not explicitly stated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/monotheism#toc38211 inclusive monotheism | monotheism | theology | Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Akhu (Ancestor) veneration===
[[Ancestor veneration]], or Akhu veneration, is a very important aspect of Kemetic Orthodoxy. Adherents believe that their [[Egyptian soul#The soul in Egyptian afterlife concepts|Akhu]] are their ancestors. As Akhu are believed to have already experienced human life, it is thought that they can give valuable advice and support regarding things related to daily human life. Members believe that honoring their Akhu ensures that they remain happy and satisfied in the [[Duat]].

Ways in which members believe that they can honour their Akhu vary, ranging from the practice of keeping household ancestor shrines, on which offerings can be made, to writing letters to the Akhu and posting them on a website designed for such a purpose, similar to the practice of writing letters to the dead found in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="VirtualAbdju"&gt;{{cite web |title=Virtual Abdju |url=http://www.kemet.org/akhu/ |publisher=The House of Netjer |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted that this practice is different from that known as Ancestor Worship.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In Kemetic Orthodoxy, Akhu generally fall into three categories:  Family, National, and Associational.

* Family Akhu represent deceased family members such as parents, siblings, children, etc.
* National Akhu are associated with the organisation of Kemetic Orthodoxy. A parallel from Ancient Egypt would be the veneration of a [[pharaoh]] or celebrated commoner.
* Associational Akhu are any other Akhu associated with an individual.  They may be through actual contact by the Akhu, through a common interest, or any other reason for the bond to be formed. Examples may include celebrities, or political leaders.&lt;ref name="VirtualAbdju" /&gt;

===Participation in and respect for the community===
As part of Kemetic Orthodoxy, members strive to support a thriving religious community, both on and off-line. Every member is required to show respect to all other members.&lt;ref name=Becoming&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Kemetic Orthodoxy?: Becoming Kemetic Orthodox |url=http://kemet.org/join |publisher=The House of Netjer |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kemetic Orthodox emphasizes the importance of family in the personal lives of adherents. The faith encourages increased relationships and understanding of an individual with their family members. This concept is related to the principle of Akhu veneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Kemetic Orthodoxy?: Family Life |url=http://kemet.org/node/583 |publisher=The House of Netjer |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Double crown.svg|thumb|150px|The Double Crown is a symbol of kingship, and thus the Nisut. The two parts of the crown symbolize the two halves (upper and lower) of Ancient Egypt.]]

===Acknowledgment of Siuda as the Nisut===
The acknowledgment of [[Tamara L. Siuda]] as spiritual leader, or Nisut-Bity, is also central to Kemetic Orthodoxy, as the religion consists of her teachings and leadership. Additionally, adherents believe that the current incarnation of the "kingly ka", or invested spirit of [[Horus|Heru]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Royal Cults of the Kings of Ancient Egypt |last=Monet |first=Jefferson |url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/royalcults.htm |publisher=www.touregypt.net |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is co-resident in the Nisut. Upon her coronation in 1996, the Nisut was believed by her followers to have become the 196th [[Pharaoh]] of the religion of Ancient Egypt. The Pharaoh in Ancient Egypt was not only the political ruler of [[Ancient Egypt|Kemet]], but also the direct religious contact between the people and Netjer, or God.  Adherents of Kemetic Orthodoxy believe that Siuda fills only the religious aspect of this title and position.&lt;ref&gt;Krogh 2004, p.171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the Nisut includes performing daily rituals to enforce [[Ma'at#Ma'at as a principle|ma'at]] and dispel isfet (the opposite of ma'at), regularly praying for the members of the faith, and advising her followers in religious matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Kemetic Orthodoxy?: The Nisut (AUS): Our Link to Netjer |url=http://kemet.org/node/581 |publisher=The House of Netjer |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==

Worship within Kemetic Orthodoxy takes many forms.  There are official, state rituals performed by the priesthood and Nisut of Kemetic Orthdoxy; there is Senut, the daily rite performed by members of the temple; and there are other, more personalized forms of worship that are left to the individual practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Kemetic Orthodoxy?: How is Kemetic Orthodoxy Practiced? |url=http://kemet.org/node/584 |publisher=The House of Netjer |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group worship===

There are several different kinds of group rituals present in Kemetic Orthodoxy. These may be held entirely in person, or may be simulcast via [[Internet Relay Chat]]. Rituals held in this fashion are celebrated fully in person at the [[Kemetic Orthodoxy#The Truth and the Mother Shrine|Truth and the Mother Shrine]], while a priest describes what is happening to participants gathered in the chat room.  During certain points, the individuals participating via simulcast may be asked to perform a ritual action at home, and will be asked to notify the priest transcribing the event when they have done so.&lt;ref name=Online&gt;Dawson 2004, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Siuda notes, however, that "Kemetic Orthodoxy is a religion on the internet, not an internet religion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn4.libsyn.com/kemetthisweek/Kemet_This_Week_-_Episode_Two.mp3 Kemet This Week, The Official Podcast of the House of Netjer: Episode Two].&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in the existence of off-line gatherings and rituals. Members of Kemetic Orthodoxy gather at [[Kemetic Orthodoxy#Tawy House|Tawy House]] in August for the Kemetic New Year, Wep Ronpet. As the largest gathering, it is the best example of an event held by the Kemetic Orthodox off-line. It includes rituals, fellowship, lectures and workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Festival Events Blog |url=http://kemet.org/community/festivals |publisher=The House of Netjer |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a form of group worship for the Kemetic Orthodox religion, as noted by Krogh &amp; Pillifant (2004) is that of ''Saq''. Saq is an ancient form of ritual possession in which a specialized priest is believed to become entirely possessed by a deity. Through this venue, the deity speaks with members of Kemetic Orthodoxy and accepts offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Krogh 2004, p.170.&lt;/ref&gt; Saqu (the plural form of Saq) may be held entirely in person, or may be simulcast via the internet, where on-line participants send messages to the attending priest, who reads them out loud to the deity in possession. It is described as being "one of the most immediate and profound experiences of Kemetic Orthodoxy".&lt;ref name=Terms&gt;{{cite web |title=Kemetic Terms Used by the Kemetic Orthodox |url=http://kemet.org/kemetic-terms |publisher=The House of Netjer |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal/Individual worship===

Individuals worship in many different ways.  From specific rituals to spur of the moment prayers, worship is an ongoing process.  The following are some examples of personal worship and rituals.

====Personal shrines====
[[Image:Personal Kemetic shrine.jpg|thumb|250px|A personal shrine to Netjer and Akhu.]]
Most members of Kemetic Orthodoxy, as part of their devotional practices, set up household shrines to the deities they worship. The basic necessities of such a shrine include an incense burner or diffuser, a lamp or candle, and a place to put offerings.&lt;ref name=Internet&gt;Krogh 2004, p.173.&lt;/ref&gt; Shrines may contain representations of certain deities, or they may have a more general focus. They often contain objects which have been offered to a deity or deities. The individual uses this shrine to perform various rituals including the [[Kemetic Orthodoxy#Senut ritual|Senut]] daily rite.&lt;ref name=Internet/&gt; Individuals may honor deities to whom they are particularly called, as well as deities in festival, deities associated with the time of year, or even deities of whom they have a special request.

In addition to these personal deity-centered shrines, members of Kemetic Orthodoxy are encouraged to set up shrines to their ancestors or Akhu, as part of [[Ancestor veneration|venerating]] their ancestors. These shrines often contain mementos of individuals close to the member who have died, and are the central focus for ancestor veneration in the member's home.&lt;ref name=Online/&gt;

====Senut ritual====

Senut, meaning "shrine", is a rite that was established by Siuda for members of Kemetic Orthodoxy as a means of formal worship in a framework where formal temples and shrines for every region were lacking. The Senut ritual is composed of various rites, and is a "fully functional ritual for individual use yet containing all of the necessary elements of ''all'' Kemetic ritual, whether practiced by one or a thousand."&lt;ref&gt;Siuda 2005, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other personal worship====

Aside from the Senut ritual, there are few other personal ritual forms of worship that exist within Kemetic Orthodoxy. Members often develop their own informal practices, which vary from person to person. Informal prayer and worship are encouraged as a necessary part of the faith.

Even though, in Kemetic Orthodoxy, individual worship is a very important aspect of one's belief, often the experiences are shared with other members of the religion. This shared experience is intended to help strengthen the bonds between members and Netjer.  Many individuals use the creation of art as a tool in worship.  These paintings, drawings, sculpture, jewelry, poetry, music, dance, and storytelling are often shared with other members.

==History==

Kemetic Orthodoxy grew out of the personal teachings of Siuda. The temple began in 1988, when she claimed to have experienced a series of visions during her initiation as a [[Wicca]]n priestess.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 2004, p.209.&lt;/ref&gt; She started a small study and worship group at that time, which gradually grew in membership. In 1993, the group was federally recognized as a religious entity and changed its name from the House of Bast to the House of Netjer. The temple was granted tax-exempt status in 1999.&lt;ref name="Krogh 2004, p.168"&gt;Krogh 2004, p.168.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the House of Netjer purchased a building to be the permanent home of the Temple in [[Joliet, Illinois]].  The building contains the main state shrine for followers of Kemetic Orthodoxy ([[Kemetic Orthodoxy#The Tawy House Retreat Center|The Truth and the Mother Shrine]]).  It also includes the offices of some members of the priesthood, and the permanent living quarters and office of Siuda.&lt;ref name=Tawy/&gt;

==Adherents==

In 1999 the following membership statistics were reported:{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

|-

|}

In recent years, an increasing number of converts have been from outside the US.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

A small number of members who were born into the faith have continued of members. It is estimated that these members make up less than 5% of Kemetic Orthodoxy's total membership.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Community===

The House of Netjer community is a global community with members in multiple countries. Because of the difficulty of maintaining contact with people from around the world, the members are divided into geographical regions. Some regions have frequent "meet-ups" where members gather for socialization, fellowship, and/or worship.&lt;ref name=Online/&gt; Some gatherings invite non-members to meet the membership.

Gatherings also take place in on-line chats of various formats. Like off-line events, on-line events vary widely in their format. The most common formats are fellowship events, with little or no structure, and educational events, where one or more member leads a group discussion on a topic of interest.

===Membership===

There are two classes of membership in Kemetic Orthodoxy, '''Remetj''' and '''Shemsu'''.

Remetj, translated as ''royal subjects'',&lt;ref name=Terms/&gt; are referred to as "friends of the faith". Some Remetj are members who have taken the free online group introductory course&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Application Guidelines and Information |url=http://kemet.org/apply |publisher=The House of Netjer |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and decided to not yet become full members, but wish to remain affiliated with Kemetic Orthodoxy. Remetj may also include those who plan on becoming members in the future, but have not yet done so, as well as individuals who were born into the faith. An adherent of Kemetic Othodoxy may also be referred to as a Remetj if they had, at one time, held the status of full member, but no longer hold such a position.

Shemsu, translated as ''followers'',&lt;ref name=Terms/&gt; are individuals who have decided to become full members of the House of Netjer temple.  This requires having previously been a Remetj (to take the introductory course) and partaking in a [[Rite of passage|ritual]] to become a full member.

This ritual consists of two parts. The first part is the determination of the convert's "Parent" and "Beloved" gods. The Kemetic Orthodox believe that the Parent god(s) create the ''[[Egyptian soul#Ba|ba]]'', or eternal soul, of the candidate; while the Beloved gods, of whom there can be any number, have taken a personal interest in helping the individual through their life. This rite is called the '''Ritual Parent Divination''', or RPD, and is a [[geomancy|geomantic]] divination that is performed on the convert's behalf by Siuda. The results of this ritual may be relayed in a face-to-face meeting between Siuda and the Remetj, or via telephone and internet.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 2004, p.212.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second half of this [[rite of passage|ritual]] is a community gathering of Remetj and Shemsu, known as Shemsu naming.  During this gathering, individuals who wish to become Shemsu, and have undergone the Rite of Parent Divination, are announced to those gathered (alternatively, the announcement may take the form of a public post on social media&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/TamaraSiuda/posts/1512817108748246 Tamara L. Siuda | RPD Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;). This announcement repeats the results of the Rite of Parent Divination and assigns each individual a religious name. This religious name is believed to be created by an individual's Parent god(s), and often has many meanings.  After everyone has been announced, all Shemsu, new and old, are charged with a set of vows, from which the following excerpt is taken:

{{quote|... charge (you) to learn the secrets of (your) Shemsu Names, and to keep them well, in service to (your) Parent(s) and your brothers and sisters in the faith, as full Shemsu of Kemetic Orthodoxy and the House of Netjer, and citizens of the nation of Kemet that lives in our kau.|Tamara Siuda, various Naming Ceremonies
{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}}}

According to House of Netjer, Shemsu namings occur both annually in person during the faith's yearly major retreat, held in August, and simulcast on the internet at various intervals throughout the year.

A subset of Shemsu are those who have undergone the initiation rite known as the ''Weshem-ib'' or "testing of the heart". In this process, members take special vows to not only place Kemetic Orthodoxy before other religious practices, but to work to serve the religion and its members. These responsibilities are in addition to the regular oaths taken by Shemsu.  A Shemsu who has completed the Weshem-ib is called a Shemsu-Ankh.  All [[priest]]s in the Kemetic Orthodoxy faith must undertake this rite.&lt;ref name=Terms/&gt;

===Priesthood===

The priesthood of Kemetic Orthodoxy is composed of both [[laity|lay]] (or non-ordained) and [[ordination|ordained]] priests.  The Kemetic Orthodoxy religion uses the term ''priest'' for both males and females.  A priest's primary responsibility is to the members, not to the Names of Netjer.

A W'ab priest, translated as ''purity priest'', is a lay priest of the Kemetic Orthodox faith.  They are Shemsu-Ankh members who have undertaken additional training and oaths of service to the members of the faith.  As a W'ab priest, the member's main responsibility is overseeing and helping in issues of purity. A W'ab priest is also responsible for maintaining an official [[shrine]] and performing daily rituals there.  Some of these shrines are open to visiting members, especially for specific rituals and/or celebrations.

An Imakhu (plural Imakhiu), translated as ''revered one'', is the only type of priest in the modern Kemetic Faith who is an [[ordination|ordained]] priest. They are given legal credentials and the right to use the title of "Reverend" outside of the Kemetic Orthodox faith.  All Imakhu serve as W'ab priests as well.&lt;ref name=Terms/&gt;

Imakhu are responsible for assisting the Nisut in maintaining and supporting the faithful, such as providing counseling (if they have been so trained), performing weddings, supporting and instructing Remetj, Shemsu, and Beginners, and acting as the Nisut's official representatives. They are also responsible for overseeing the administrative requirements of running the House of Netjer temple, including finances, correspondence, managing time and resources, reporting to membership and Siuda, teaching, maintaining and updating the Kemetic Orthodox internet presence, scheduling appointments and trips for Siuda, personal security, and many other jobs.

An Imakhu who has performed exceptional service may receive the title of Kai-Imakhu, the prefix "Kai" translated as "exalted". Kai-Imakhu, in addition to their regular duties as an Imakhu, are also responsible overseeing the other Imakhu.&lt;ref name=Terms/&gt;

==Tawy House Retreat Center==

The Tawy House Retreat Center organises religious and study retreats for members of Kemetic Orthodoxy.  These include the week-long celebrations of ''Wep Ronpet'' or Kemetic New Year's Day (early August).&lt;ref name=Tawy&gt;[http://www.tawyhouse.org/ Tawy House Website].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Truth and Mother Temple.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Truth and the Mother'', the main shrine of Kemetic Orthodoxy]]

'''The Truth and the Mother Shrine''' is the main state shrine of the followers of the Kemetic Orthodox Religion.  Included and associated with this shrine are a variety of individual and group deity shrines, such as the [[Egyptian soul#The soul in Egyptian afterlife concepts|Akhu]] shrine and [[Nisut]] shrine. These shrines often rotate through the year based on current festivals and the needs of the membership. The Truth and the Mother Shrine is also linked to various priest shrines around the world.&lt;ref name=Tawy/&gt;

The '''Imhotep Kemetic Orthodox Seminary''' is a school devoted to the theological study of the Kemetic Orthodox religion. It offers introductory and intermediate classes in the [[Middle Egyptian language]], as well as a course in Kemetic protective magic, known as "Sau". These courses are optional for all members of the faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kemetschool.org/ Imhotep Kemetic Orthodox Seminary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Udjat Foundation''' was an affiliated non-profit organization dedicated specifically to children's welfare causes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udjat.org/ The Udjat Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kemetic Orthodoxy and other religions==

Kemetic Orthodoxy does not have any official relationship with any other religions. Other modern Kemetic groups, such as [[Akhet Hwt-Hrw]], [[Per Ankh]] and [[Per Heh]], do not claim affiliation with or share the beliefs of Kemetic Orthodoxy.

===Religious Pluralism===

As Kemetic Orthodoxy does not teach that it is the only religious path that one can or should follow, some members practice more than one religious belief. Members are asked to keep other beliefs and practices separate from their Kemetic beliefs and practices. If a member has gone through the Weshem-ib or "testing of the heart" ritual, they are asked to place their Kemetic practices and beliefs first, and other religious thoughts second. No Kemetic Orthodox member is obliged to participate in this rite, though it is a mandatory prerequisite for priesthood.&lt;ref name=Becoming/&gt;

===Proselytism===

The Kemetic Orthodox religion does not ask its members to seek converts.&lt;ref name=Becoming/&gt;

'''''Kolchak: The Night Stalker''''' is an American [[television series]] that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the 1974–1975 season. It featured a fictional Chicago newspaper reporter—Carl Kolchak, played by [[Darren McGavin]]—who investigated mysterious crimes with unlikely causes, particularly those that law enforcement authorities would not follow up. These often involved the [[supernatural]] or [[science fiction]], including fantastic creatures.  The series was preceded by two [[television movie]]s, ''[[The Night Stalker (1972 film)|The Night Stalker]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Night Strangler (film)|The Night Strangler]]'' (1973). Although the series lasted only a single season, it remains popular in syndication. In 2018, it aired late Saturday nights on [[MeTV]].

[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] cited Kolchak as a "tremendous influence" in creating his franchise ''[[The X-Files]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/10/23/17989508/x-files-25th-anniversary-monsters-of-the-week-excerpt-todd-vanderwerff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=F&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Forbes]]|date=2012-02-23|title=Johnny Depp's "Kolchak, the Night Stalker" Will Be Made by...Disney?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2012/02/23/johnny-depps-kolchak-the-night-stalker-will-be-made-by-disney/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that success in 2005 ''The X-Files'' producer [[Frank Spotnitz]] resurrected [[Night Stalker (TV series)|second television series]] with a new cast and characters, as well as subsequent novels and comic books.  It was a ratings bomb and was quietly cancelled after only six of the ten episodes produced were aired.

==Predecessors==

===Origins===
The main character originated in an unpublished novel, ''The Kolchak Papers'', written by Jeff Rice. In it, a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] newspaper reporter named Carl Kolchak tracks down and defeats a [[serial killer]] who turns out to be a [[vampire]] named Janos Skorzeny. Although the reporter uses the name "Carl", the novel reveals that his birth name is "Karel". After the success of the TV film and its sequel, the novel was published in 1973 by Pocket Books as a mass-market paperback original titled ''The Night Stalker'', with a photo of Darren McGavin on the cover to tie it to the film.

The second television film, ''The Night Strangler'', was also turned into a novel (written by Jeff Rice but based on a script by [[Richard Matheson]]), published in 1974 by Pocket Books.

Both novels were republished in 2007 by Moonstone in an omnibus edition called ''The Kolchak Papers''.  Moonstone Books continues to produce ''Kolchak'' comic books.

===''The Night Stalker''===
{{Main|The Night Stalker (1972 film)}}
ABC approached Rice with an offer to [[option (films)|option]] ''The Kolchak Papers'', which was adapted eventually by [[Richard Matheson]] into a television movie, ''The Night Stalker''.  It was produced by [[Dan Curtis]] and directed by [[John Llewellyn Moxey]]. Darren McGavin played the role of Carl. The cast also included [[Carol Lynley]], [[Simon Oakland]], [[Ralph Meeker]], [[Claude Akins]], [[Charles McGraw]], [[Kent Smith]], [[Stanley Adams (actor)|Stanley Adams]], [[Elisha Cook Jr.]], [[Larry Linville]], Jordan Rhodes, and [[Barry Atwater]] as the vampire Janos Skorzeny.

''The Night Stalker'' first aired January 11, 1972, and garnered the highest ratings of any television movie at that time (33.2 rating &amp;ndash; 54 share). Matheson received a 1973 [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] for Best TV Feature or Miniseries Teleplay.

===''The Night Strangler''===
{{Main|The Night Strangler (film)}}
Impressed by the success of the first television movie, ABC commissioned Richard Matheson to write a second movie, ''The Night Strangler'' (1973), which featured another serial killer in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] who strangled his victims and used their blood to keep himself alive for over a century. Kolchak recruits exotic dancer and psychology student Louise Harper ([[Jo Ann Pflug]]) to assist him in tracking down the eponymous strangler.

A fictitious version of [[Seattle Underground Tour|the Seattle Underground City]] was used as a setting for much of the movie's action, and provided the killer with his hiding place. [[Dan Curtis]] both produced and directed the second movie, which also did well in the ratings. Rice wrote a novelization based on Matheson's screenplay. The novel was published in 1974 by Pocket Books as a mass-market paperback original under the title ''The Night Strangler'' with a close-up photo of the monster's eye to tie in with the movie.

[[Simon Oakland]] reprised his earlier role as Kolchak's editor, Tony Vincenzo. The cast also included [[Richard Anderson]], [[Scott Brady]], [[Wally Cox]], [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]], [[John Carradine]], [[Carol Wayne#Early life|Nina Wayne]] and [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]].

Several scenes were filmed with [[George Tobias]] playing a reporter who recalled a series of murders he had investigated during the 1930s.  These scenes were cut before airing because of time constraints.

==Production==

The first four episodes had the title ''The Night Stalker,'' with ''Kolchak: The Night Stalker''   being used for the rest of the episodes, although home video releases were changed to reflect the second title. (The series theme had originally been part of the music score which [[Gil Melle]] had composed for ''[[The Questor Tapes]].''){{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In late 1973, Matheson and [[William F. Nolan]] completed the script for an intended third television movie, to be titled ''The Night Killers,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Richard Matheson's Kolchak Scripts |last=Matheson |first=Richard  |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Gauntlet Press |isbn=1-887368-64-7 |ref=Matheson}}&lt;/ref&gt; a story about [[Android (robot)|android]] replicas. ABC decided that it wanted a weekly series instead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert "Bob" Martin|Martin, Bob]] and David Hirsch, "'Kolchak: The Night Stalker,'" ''Starlog Photo Guidebook: TV Episode Guides, Vol. 2,'' [[Starlog|Starlog Press, Inc.]], January 1982, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

After some negotiation, McGavin agreed to return as Kolchak and also served as the series's executive producer, though he was not credited as such.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Bob, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither ABC nor Universal had obtained Jeff Rice's permission, and he sued the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklyuniverse.com/2003/kolchak.htm |title=Return of Carl Kolchak: Night Stalker &amp; Paranormal Investigator |author=Vanessa Cortez |date=September 12, 2003 |publisher=Weekly Universe |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was resolved shortly before the series aired in the fall 1974 season, replacing ''[[Toma (TV series)|Toma]]'' on the network's Friday night schedule. Rice received an on-screen credit as series creator. The first four episodes aired under the title of ''The Night Stalker.'' After a month-long hiatus, the series was renamed and returned as ''Kolchak: The Night Stalker.''&lt;ref name="Companion"&gt;"The Night Stalker Companion: A 25th Anniversary Tribute," Mark Dawidziak.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While the show was set in [[Chicago]] and some generic location/background filming was done there (all in summer and early fall), the show was filmed primarily in Los Angeles and at [[Universal Studios]].

The show featured a wide range of guest stars and many Hollywood veterans, including: [[Ken Lynch]], [[Charles Aidman]], [[Randy Boone]], [[Scatman Crothers]], [[Dick Van Patten]], [[Jan Murray]], [[Larry Storch]], [[Jeanne Cooper]], [[Alice Ghostley]], [[Victor Jory]], [[Murray Matheson]], [[Julie Adams]], [[John Dehner]], [[Phil Silvers]], [[Bernie Kopell]], [[Marvin Miller]], [[Carol Ann Susi]], [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]], [[James Gregory (actor)|James Gregory]], [[Hans Conried]], [[Mary Wickes]], [[Henry Jones (actor)|Henry Jones]], [[Carolyn Jones]], [[Jackie Mason]], [[Stella Stevens]], [[Abraham Sofaer]], [[David Doyle (actor)|David Doyle]], [[Jim Backus]], [[Kathleen Freeman]], [[John Hoyt]], [[Dwayne Hickman]], [[Eric Braeden]], [[Tom Skerritt]], [[Erik Estrada]], [[William Daniels]], [[Jamie Farr]], [[Lara Parker]], [[Pat Harrington, Jr.]], [[Larry Linville]] and [[Richard Kiel]]. [[Jimmy Hawkins]] appeared on the series as a [[Catholic]] priest on November 1, 1974, in what proved to be his last acting appearance. McGavin's wife and assistant, [[Kathie Browne]], appeared in the final episode as Lt. Irene Lamont.

In addition, the series provided the first professional writing credit for [[Robert Zemeckis]] and his writing partner [[Bob Gale]], who wrote the script for the episode "Chopper." [[David Chase]], creator of ''[[The Sopranos]],'' also worked on the series as a story editor, his first regular crew position in [[Hollywood]]. Though Chase is credited on eight episodes as story editor, he also helped rewrite the remaining 12, and McGavin and others attribute much of the show's quirky humor to his creative input.

The show's ratings were mediocre and McGavin was growing dissatisfied, resulting in its cancellation after one year. The series aired on Friday nights at 10pm - a virtual graveyard for most TV series, particularly one aimed at a younger audience. In January 1975, the show was moved to Friday nights at 8pm, where it remained until August when it was cancelled. McGavin found himself rewriting scripts and doing much of the work of a producer, but without getting either the full credit or the full compensation of one. McGavin had been unhappy with what he felt was the show's "[[monster of the week]]" direction, and an exhausting filming schedule. He asked to be released from his contract with two episodes remaining to be filmed, which the network granted in light of the show's dwindling ratings.

Two television movies, ''The Demon and the Mummy'' and ''[[Crackle of Death]],'' were cobbled together in 1976. Each contains new footage as well as previously screened episodes from the series. McGavin provided a voice-over for both, which allowed the narrative to maintain some continuity.

==Characters==
The series features Kolchak as a reporter for the [[Chicago]] branch of the Independent News Service (INS), a small [[wire service]].

===INS characters===
*'''Carl Kolchak''' ([[Darren McGavin]])  Kolchak is a talented but outspoken investigative reporter with an affinity for bizarre and supernatural occurrences, obtaining information driving around Chicago in his yellow [[Ford Mustang]] convertible and snatching exclusives armed with his camera and portable cassette recorder.

:Using only limited information, Kolchak has cracked several cases relying on gut instinct and often prevailing through sheer dumb luck.  More often than not, Kolchak's prospects are hampered by the destruction of evidence to prove his claims, advancing the sheer implausibility of his stories where his peers, particularly his editor, are concerned.  On other occasions his investigations have led to demotion or relocation of varying authority figures, though reasons for these actions are never truthfully disclosed.

*'''Tony Vincenzo''' ([[Simon Oakland]]) &amp;ndash; Kolchak's bellicose editor, and one of the only people willing to tolerate Kolchak's antics, despite their frequent arguments. Vincenzo has a grudging respect for Kolchak's reporting skills, but often finds himself caught between Kolchak's zeal and his own management responsibilities. Vincenzo's hot temper often affects his blood pressure and digestion and he sometimes laments that he did not go into his family's Venetian blinds business.
*'''Ron Updyke''' ([[Jack Grinnage]]) &amp;ndash; Kolchak's supercilious rival at INS whom Kolchak repeatedly refers to as "Uptight". A San Francisco native, Updyke is the opposite of Kolchak, always smartly dressed and hobnobbing with Chicago's elite.
*'''Emily Cowles''' ([[Ruth McDevitt]]) &amp;ndash; an elderly puzzles and advice columnist known as "Miss Emily". Cowles aspires to be a novelist and expresses passion for issues relating to the elderly. She is often sympathetic toward Kolchak and the two share a warm working relationship.
*'''Monique Marmelstein''' ([[Carol Ann Susi]]) &amp;ndash; is a graduate of the Columbia School of Journalism and an intern whose Uncle Abe is highly placed in INS management.  Despite her education and enthusiasm, many of her coworkers believe she got her job due to nepotism, an allegation she denies.

===Other recurring characters===
*'''Gordon "Gordy The Ghoul" Spangler''' ([[John Fiedler]]) &amp;ndash; a city morgue attendant and sometime source for Kolchak.
*'''Captain "Mad Dog" Siska''' ([[Keenan Wynn]]) &amp;ndash; a Chicago police officer whose efforts to rein in his temper were constantly thwarted by Kolchak's abrasiveness.

===Monsters===
The series managed in its short run to tackle most of the major [[monster]] myths, including classics such as vampires, [[werewolf|werewolves]], [[mummy|mummies]] and [[zombie]]s. It also included stories about a [[doppelganger]], [[witches]], a [[succubus]] and a pact with [[Satan]]. Four episodes focused on monsters and [[spirit]]s based in native folklore (two involving [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] legends, one [[Hindu]] and one [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]]).

The series also dealt with creatures from science fiction, including a killer [[Android (robot)|android]], an invisible [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]], a [[prehistory|prehistoric man]] thawed back to life, and a [[lizard]]-creature protecting its eggs.

The series also featured some more esoteric antagonists, including a headless motorcycle rider that hinted at the [[headless horseman]] myth and an animated [[knight]]'s suit of armor possessed by a spirit. A story about [[Jack the Ripper]] was one of the few based on an actual historical figure, though the series provided a supernatural explanation. An episode about [[Helen of Troy]] ([[Cathy Lee Crosby]] appeared in the role) dealt with immortality and aging.

==Music==
[[Robert Cobert]] scored the music for the original television movies. [[Gil Mellé]] wrote the music for the TV series, beginning with the theme that begins with Kolchak whistling in the opening credits. Mellé was hired and the theme was written in 20 minutes, just before the opening credits were shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/music-la-melle-part-2_article_43016.html|title=Answerbag.com - Ask Questions, Get Answers, Find Information|work=Answerbag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellé left the series after the fourth episode, saying it was becoming too light-hearted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulvuedrive-in.com/review/2888/Kolchak+The+Night+Stalker+1974+75+series+|title=Kolchak: The Night Stalker (1974-75 series)|work=fulvuedrive-in.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composer [[Jerry Fielding]] took over scoring music for the remaining series, augmented by one score each from Greig McRitchie (best known for his collaborations with Fielding, and [[James Horner]]), and Luchi De Jesus. [[Music supervision|Music Supervisor]] [[Hal Mooney]] re-used much of Mellé's score in various later episodes (most notably ''The Spanish Moss Murders'' which has no credited score composer) along with material from the other composers.

Two soundtrack albums have been produced. One released in 2000 by [[Varèse Sarabande]] features two suites of Cobert's music from the TV movies. The other, a bootleg copy of Melle's private tapes, features his theme and scores written for the first three episodes (''The Ripper'', ''U.F.O.'' and ''Vampire''), and two cues from TVmovie "The Questor Tapes."

The Mellé theme also appears on the [[TVT Records]]' ''[[Television's Greatest Hits]] Volume 5''. However, all licensed soundtrack recordings of the theme use an otherwise rare original recording alternate take of the theme. Initially identifiable by the altered opening whistle, an off-key electronic note is seemingly randomly introduced towards the end, but when synchronized with picture it corresponds to a specific visual. Mellé was known for his innovative use of electronic orchestration (which was used throughout the series), however the producers chose not to include this stylistic element in his main title for broadcast, instead opting for a more conventional all-orchestral sound.

===Unproduced scripts===
The series was cancelled with only 20 episodes completed but the initial order of 26 meant there were scripts that were completed but unproduced for the series. Three additional scripts commissioned before the series was cancelled still survive.

;"Eve of Terror", written by Stephen Lloyd
The story is summed up by Kolchak's opening narration: "What if I told you that a deranged feminist murdered a Casanova lab technician, a sex goddess, and her purveyor?"

;"The Get of Belial", written by Donn Mullally
Kolchak is assigned to cover a miners' strike in the mountains of West Virginia. He uncovers gruesome murders associated with a backwoods family and Kolchak suspects that they have some sort of inbred monster living with them.

;"The Executioners", written by Max Hodge
Kolchak is demoted, and is given the choice of writing obituaries or writing articles for the arts section. He chooses the latter, and discovers a painting tied into a series of murders that Vincenzo is covering. These murders occur in a series of three, in which the first victim is hanged, the second executed with an ax, and the third poisoned. Working with an art expert, Kolchak attempts to unravel who or what is behind these bizarre murders and what they have to do with the painting, without alerting Vincenzo that he is working on the same story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darrenmcgavin.net/unproduced_ns_scripts.htm|title=Unproduced NS scripts|work=darrenmcgavin.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Though Kolchak was short-lived as a series, its impact on popular culture has been 
substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulvuedrive-in.com/review/3809/Night+Stalker+2005+The+Complete+Series|title=Night Stalker (2005) - The Complete Series|work=fulvuedrive-in.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the series has been described as a predecessor to ''[[The X-Files]]'' (1993–2002,2016,2018). ''The X-Files'' creator, [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], has acknowledged that the show had influenced him greatly in his own work. In one interview when mentioned that the majority of the viewing public considered the success of ''The X-Files'' series as being inspired by other such past shows such as ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' or ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', Carter mentions that while those shows were indeed an influence on ''The X-Files'', it was only about ten percent, with another thirty percent coming from the ''Kolchak'' series, with the rest derived as being based upon original 'pure inspiration'. Carter paid tribute to ''Kolchak'' in a number of ways in the 
show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Stargate/4991/kolchak/klchk10.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012223844/http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Stargate/4991/kolchak/klchk10.htm|title=X-Files vs. The Night Stalker|archivedate=12 October 2007|work=geocities.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A character named "Richard Matheson", named for the screenwriter of the pilot films, appeared in several episodes. Carter also wanted McGavin to appear as Kolchak in one or more episodes of ''The X-Files'', but McGavin was unwilling to reprise the character for the show.  He did eventually appear in several episodes as Arthur Dales, a retired [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|FBI]] agent described as the "father of the X-Files". In the third episode of the 2016 revival series, a character prominently featured in the episode ''[[Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster]]'' is conspicuously attired in Kolchak's trademark seersucker jacket, black knit tie, and straw hat.

Gary Gygax has cited an episode of the series as part of the inspiration behind the Rakshasa in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?22566-Q-amp-A-with-Gary-Gygax/page400&amp;highlight=gary+gygax|title=Ended Q&amp;A with Gary Gygax - Page 400|work=enworld.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 television series===
{{Main|Night Stalker (TV series)}}

Though Rice retains the rights to written Kolchak works, and [[Universal Studios]] owns the rights to the TV series, ABC maintained dramatic rights to the character and ownership of the two TV movies. The network began airing a new ''Night Stalker'' series on September 29, 2005, with the character Carl Kolchak portrayed by [[Stuart Townsend]]. On November 14, 2005, ABC and creator [[Frank Spotnitz]] announced that the new series was being cancelled due to low ratings. The 2005 series is available on DVD.

In a nod to the original series, the pilot episode has a brief shot from the original TV series of Darren McGavin in the INS newsroom, as the new Kolchak (Townsend) is walking through it. Inserted digitally, McGavin is dressed in the same frumpy clothes he wore as Kolchak in the original series and smiles knowingly while touching his hat. The satchel in which Kolchak carried wooden stakes and a cross to battle Skorzeny is shown. In another shot, when fellow reporter Perri Reed ([[Gabrielle Union]]) is searching through Kolchak's room, the hat McGavin wore in the original series is seen hanging on a coat rack. Other character names from the TV movies are referenced in various episodes, and one episode ("Timeless") recycled much of the plot of the TV movie ''The Night Strangler''. In the 1970s, the Kolchak character was often seen in his yellow 1966 [[Ford Mustang]] convertible while in the new series' Kolchak drives an orange Mustang from 2005.

===Other projects===
In 1991, author [[Mark Dawidziak]] wrote ''Night Stalking: A 20th Anniversary "Night Stalker" Companion'' detailing the production of the movies and TV series. In 1994, Dawidziak worked with Rice to produce the first official "Kolchak" material since the end of the TV series. The novel, ''Grave Secrets'', moved Kolchak from Chicago to Los Angeles where he obtained a job at the ''Hollywood Dispatch'' newspaper (nicknamed the "Disgrace"). Most of the recurring characters from the TV movies and series also appear. Kolchak investigates a ghost who is killing those responsible for the destruction of the cemetery where its body is buried. An expanded and updated version of Dawidziak's "Night Stalking" was published in 1997 by Pomegranate Press as "The Night Stalker Companion." In 2003, the scripts for "The Night Stalker," "The Night Strangler" and the unfilmed "The Night Killers" were published by Gauntlet Press as "Richard Matheson's Kolchak Scripts" (edited with introductions by Dawidziak).

A [[comic book]] based on the property was published in 2003 by [[Moonstone Books]] with some commercial success. Moonstone continues to publish both a bimonthly serial magazine and a series of prose novels and graphic novels featuring the characters. Moonstone also adapted Rice's original ''The Night Stalker'' script as well as two unfilmed scripts for the TV series: "The Get of Belial" and "Eve of Terror".

In 2006, Moonstone published a short fiction anthology, ''The Night Stalker Chronicles'', with short stories contributed by writers such as [[Peter David]], [[Mike W. Barr]], [[Stuart Kaminsky]], [[Richard Dean Starr]], [[C. J. Henderson]], Dawidziak and [[Max Allan Collins]]. A second volume, ''Kolchak: The Night Stalker Casebook'', was published in January 2007 featuring new short fiction by authors including [[P. N. Elrod]], [[Christopher Golden]], [[Richard Dean Starr]], Dawidziak and [[Elaine Bergstrom]]. Between 2007 and 2012, Moonstone published several ''Night Stalker'' novels and novellas, including ''The Lovecraftian Horror'', ''The Lovecraftian Damnation'', ''A Black and Evil Truth'' and ''The Lost City'', all by [[C. J. Henderson]]. ''A Black and Evil Truth'' was later released as an audiobook.

===Film adaptation===
In May 2012, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] announced a film adaptation is in the works with [[Johnny Depp]] starring and producing with [[Edgar Wright]] directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title=Johnny Depp's 'Night Stalker' Movie Enlists 'High Fidelity' Writer (Exclusive)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/johnny-depps-night-stalker-movie-dv-devincentis-326709|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media releases===
[[Twentieth Century Fox]] released the first TV movie on VHS, "The Night Stalker," as part of its "Selections" series.  [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM Home Video]] released the two TV movies on DVD on August 24, 2004. [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] released ''Kolchak: The Night Stalker&amp;nbsp;– The Complete Series'' on DVD a year later.  [[Madman Entertainment]] released the complete series on DVD in Australia and New Zealand on July 15, 2009.

The two TV films, "The Night Stalker" and "The Night Strangler" were released on blu-ray disc October 2, 2018.

'''Kongo religion''' is a broad set of traditional beliefs from the [[Kongo language|KiKongo]] speaking peoples. The faith bases itself in the idea of a main creator god named [[Nzambi a Mpungu|Nzambi Mpungu]] who made the world and spirits who inhabit it. Priestly doctors known as [[Nganga]] try to heal followers minds and bodies. Mediatory roles like being a Nganga require legitimization from the other world of spirits and ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kongo Religion|date=2005|website=encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/kongo-religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The universe is split between two worlds, one of the living (nza yayi) and a world of the dead (nsi a bafwa), these worlds are split by a body of water. Humans continually pass through these worlds in cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/kongo.html|title=Kongo Religion|website=philatar.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
The religion of the Kongo is deeply complex. According to historian [[John K. Thornton]] "Central Africans have probably never agreed among themselves as to what their cosmology is in detail, a product of what I called the process of continuous revelation and precarious priesthood."&lt;ref name=thornton73&gt;John Thornton, "Religious and Ceremonial Life in the Kongo and Mbundu Areas," in Linda M. Heywood (ed) ''Central Africans and Cultural Transformations in the American Disapora'' (London and New York:  Cambridge University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|978-0-521-00278-3}}, pp. 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kongo people had diverse views, with traditional religious thought best developed in the northern Kikongo-speaking area.&lt;ref name=thornton73/&gt; There is plenty of description about Kongo religious ideas in the Christian missionary and colonial era records, but as Thornton states, "these are written with a hostile bias and their reliability is problematic".&lt;ref&gt;John Thornton (2002), "Religious and Ceremonial Life," Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-00278-3}}, pp. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Kongo beliefs included ''Kilundu'' as ''Nzambi'' (god) or ''Jinzambi'' (gods, deities), all had only limited powers.&lt;ref name=thornton74&gt;John Thornton (2002), "Religious and Ceremonial Life," Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-00278-3}}, pp. 74-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Spirits as well as dead ancestors could be communed with and those with authority got special rights to such communing. The priestly [[Nganga]] can interact with such spirits and ancestors. They would use spiritual cures to battle black magic in the world, sometimes using [[Nkisi]]. [[Nganga]] are not allowed to use black magic and only assisted clients to bring upon good fortune.&lt;ref name="PaloBook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Erwan Dianteill|title=Kongo in Cuba: the Transformations of an African Religion|url=https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_ASSR_117_0004--congo-to-cuba-transformations-of-an.htm |publisher=Centre for the Interdisciplinary Study of Religious Phenomena|pages=59–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The traditional religion has its roots in [[Bantu language|Bantu speaking]] peoples in Africa. As the faith came to the Americas it retained various traditions but often mixed with other faiths. Some surviving traditions include possession by the dead to learn wisdom from the ancestors, and working with [[Nkisi]]. The religions that have preserved Kongo traditions include [[Palo (religion)|Palo Mayombe]], [[Kumina]], [[Haitian Vodou]], [[:es:Lumbalú|Lumbalú]] and [[Candomblé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meta-religion.com/World_Religions/Other_religions/kongo_religion.htm|title=Kongo religion|website=meta-religion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kumhar''' is a [[Indian caste system|caste]] or community in India and Pakistan. ''Kumhar'' literally means [[pottery|potter]] in Indian languages.&lt;ref name="Saraswati1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Saraswati |first=Baidyanath |title=Pottery-Making Cultures And Indian Civilization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqrB_Nzr5QcC&amp;pg=PA46 |accessdate=6 April 2013 |year=1979 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=978-81-7017-091-4 |pages=46–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending upon the subgroup or region, in India they are classified as both [[Other Backward Class]] and the [[Scheduled Caste]].

== Etymology ==
The Kumhars derive their name from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Kumbhakar'' meaning earthen-pot maker.&lt;ref name="K. S. Singh"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=vm_KCE4XXPMC&amp;pg=PA565 |title=People of India: Rajasthan |publisher=Popular Prakashan |first=S. K. |last=Mandal |chapter=Kumhar/Kumbhar |editor-first=Kumar Suresh |editor-last=Singh |editor-link=Kumar Suresh Singh |year=1998 |pages=565–566 |isbn=978-8-17154-769-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dravidian languages conform to the same meaning of the term ''Kumbhakar''. The term ''Bhande'', used to designate the Kumhar caste, also means pot. The potters of [[Amritsar]] are called ''Kulal'' or ''Kalal'', the term used in Yajurveda to denote the potter class.&lt;ref name="Saraswati1" /&gt;

== Mythological origin ==
A section of Hindu Kumhars honorifically call themselves ''Prajapati'' after Vedic Prajapati, the Lord, who created the universe.&lt;ref name="Saraswati1" /&gt;

According to a legend prevalent among Kumhars {{quote|Once [[Brahma]] divided sugarcane among his sons and each of them ate his share, but the Kumhara who was greatly absorbed in his work, forgot to eat. The piece which he had kept near his clay lump struck root and soon grew into a sugarcane plant. A few days later, when Brahma asked his sons for sugarcane, none of them could give it to him, excepting the Kumhara who offered a full plant. Brahma was pleased by the devotion of the potter to his work and awarded him the title ''Prajapati''.&lt;ref name="Saraswati1"/&gt;}}

There is an opinion that this is because of their traditional creative skills of pottery, they are regarded as ''Prajapati''.&lt;ref name="Ke. Āra Bhāratī"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=VO9cP6LYR8wC&amp;pg=PA178 |title=Chamba Himalaya: Amazing Land, Unique Culture |publisher=Indus Publishing |first=Ke. Āra |last=Bhāratī |year=2001 |page=178 |isbn=978-8-17387-125-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions ==

The Potters are classified into Hindu and Muslim cultural groups.&lt;ref name="Saraswati1" /&gt; Among Hindus, inclusion of Artisan castes in [[Shudra]] [[Varna]] is indisputable. The potters belong to the Shudra group of artisans of Hindu society. They are further divided into two groups-clean caste and unclean caste .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saraswati |first=Baidyanath |title=Pottery-Making Cultures And Indian Civilization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqrB_Nzr5QcC&amp;pg=PA48 |accessdate=6 April 2013 |year=1979 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=978-81-7017-091-4 |page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Kumhars are groups such as the Gujrati Kumhar, Rana Kumhar, Lad and Telangi. They all, bear these names after different cultural linguistic zones or caste groups but are termed as one caste cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=gLAFhJ1cev4C&amp;pg=PA293 |title=Rise of Anthropology in India |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |first=Lalita Prasad |last=Vidyarthi |year=1976 |page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution in India ==

=== Chamba (Himanchal) ===
The Kumhars of Chamba are expert in making pitchers, Surahis, vessels, grain jars, toys for entertainment and earthen lamps. Some of these pots bear paintings and designs also.&lt;ref name="Ke. Āra Bhāratī"/&gt;

=== Maharashtra (Marathe) ===
Kumhars are found in [[Satara district|Satara]], [[Sangli]], [[Kolhapur]], [[Sholapur]] and [[Pune]]. They speak in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] among themselves but in Marathi as well as [[Hindi]] with outsiders. They use [[Devnagari]] script for communication.&lt;ref name="B. V. Bhanu"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=BsBEgVa804IC&amp;pg=PA1175 |title=People of India: Maharashtra, Part 2 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |first=I.

V. |editor-last=Bhanu |year=2004 |pages=1175–1176 |isbn=978-8-17991-101-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are Kumbhars who do not belong to Maratha clan lives in Maharashtra and have occupation of making idols and pots.&lt;ref name="Saraswati1" /&gt; They are aware of the Hindu Varna hierarchy and consider themselves to be the [[Shudra]], the lowest rank.&lt;ref name="B. V. Bhanu" /&gt;

=== Madhya Pradesh ===

Hathretie and Chakretie (or Challakad) Kumhars are found in [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Hathretie Kumhars are called so because they traditionally moved the "chak" (potter's wheel) by hands ("hath"). Gola is a common surname among Kumhars in Madhya Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tdil.mit.gov.in/coilnet/ignca/mrnslp04.htm |title=The Kumhars of Gwalior |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323001836/http://tdil.mit.gov.in/CoilNet/IGNCA/mrnslp04.htm |archivedate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=please can we have a translation|date=February 2018}} They are categorised as a Scheduled Caste in [[Chhatarpur]], [[Datia]], [[Panna, Madhya Pradesh|Panna]], [[Satna]], [[Tikamgarh]], [[Sidhi]] and [[Shahdol]] districts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322182222/http://socialjustice.nic.in/pdf/scordermadhyapradesh.pdf |archivedate=23 March 2016 |url=http://socialjustice.nic.in/pdf/scordermadhyapradesh.pdf |title=Part IX - Madhya Pradesh  |publisher=DSJE, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; but elsewhere in the state they are listed among Other Backward Classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbc.nic.in/User_Panel/GazetteResolution.aspx?Value=mPICjsL1aLuPAiTDwaBMRTkcitPtwFoYzSMa8KYD1%2bOnCvxcJphCC3moLReVyaIr |title=Central List of OBCs: State : Madhya Pradesh |publisher=National Commission for Backwards Classes |accessdate=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rajasthan ===
In Rajasthan, Kumhars (Also known as Prajapat) have six sub-groups namely Mathera, Kumavat, Kheteri, Marwara, Timria and Mawalia. In the social hierarchy of Rajasthan, they are placed in the middle of the higher castes and the [[Harijan]]s. They follow endogamy with clan exogamy.&lt;ref name="K. S. Singh" /&gt;

=== Orissa and Bengal ===
In Bengal Kumhars are one among the ceremonially pure castes. The Jagannathia Kumhars of Orissa, who provide vessels for the rice distribution in Jagannath temple, have much higher rank in the society than the Kumhars of Central India.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

=== Uttar Pradesh and Bihar ===
The Kannuaja Kumhars are considered to be a Shudra caste in both Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Although they sometimes use the term ''[[Pandit]]'' with their names, they do so as a suffix rather than prefixing it in the honorific style that is used by [[Brahmin]]s. The Magahiya Kumhars are treated little inferior to the Kanaujias and the Turkaha (Gadhere) Kumhars rank with untouchables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saraswati |first=Baidyanath |title=Pottery-Making Cultures And Indian Civilization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqrB_Nzr5QcC&amp;pg=PA49 |accessdate=6 April 2013 |year=1979 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=978-81-7017-091-4 |pages=49–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prajapati are among 17 OBC communities that were proposed for Scheduled Caste status by the [[Samajwadi Party]]-controlled [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]] in 2016. However, this proposal, which relates to [[votebank politics]], has been stayed by the courts; the prior attempt had been rejected by the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Setback for Akhilesh government as High Court stays their order to include 17 sub-castes in the SC category |date=24 January 2017 |work=Financial Express |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/elections/uttar-pradesh-assembly-elections-2017/setback-for-akhilesh-government-as-high-court-stays-their-order-to-include-17-sub-castes-in-the-sc-category/520325/ |accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UP govt to include 17 other backward castes in SC list |date=22 December 2016 |agency=PTI |work=Hindustan Times |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-to-include-17-other-backward-castes-in-sc-list/story-jQWfybFAcSJTnwj2k4NxqO.html |accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kṣitigarbha''' ([[Sanskrit]] क्षितिगर्भ / ''{{IAST|Kṣitigarbha}}'', {{cjkv|t=地藏|s=地藏|j=地蔵|r=Jizō|p=Dìzàng|k=지장(地藏)|rr=Jijang}}) is a [[bodhisattva]] primarily revered in [[East Asian Buddhism]] and usually depicted as a [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]]. His name may be translated as "Earth Treasury", "Earth Store", "Earth Matrix", or "Earth Womb".  Kṣitigarbha is known for his vow to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the [[Desire realm|six worlds]] between the death of [[Gautama Buddha]] and the rise of [[Maitreya]], as well as his vow not to achieve [[Buddhahood]] until all [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell]]s are emptied. He is therefore often regarded as the bodhisattva of hell-beings, as well as the guardian of children and patron deity of deceased children and aborted fetuses in Japanese culture, where he is known as Jizō or Ojizō-sama, as a protector of children.

Usually depicted as a monk with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] around his shaved head, he carries a [[khakkhara|staff]] to force open the gates of hell and a [[Cintamani|wish-fulfilling jewel]] to light up the darkness.

== Overview ==
Kṣitigarbha is one of the four principal [[bodhisattva]]s in East Asian [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]]. The others are [[Samantabhadra]], [[Manjusri]], and [[Avalokiteśvara]].

At the pre-[[Tang dynasty]] grottos in [[Dunhuang]] and [[Longmen Grottoes|Longmen]], he is depicted in a classical bodhisattva form. After the Tang, he became increasingly depicted as a monk carrying [[Buddhist prayer beads]] and a staff.

His full name in Chinese is ''Dayuan Dizang Pusa'' ({{zh|t=大願地藏菩薩|p=Dàyuàn Dìzàng Púsà}}), or "Bodhisattva King Kṣitigarbha of the Great Vow," pronounced ''Daigan Jizō Bosatsu'' in Japanese and ''Jijang Bosal'' in Korean. This name is a reference to his pledge, as recorded in the [[sutra]]s, to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the [[Desire realm|six worlds]] in the era between the [[parinirvana]] of the Buddha and the rise of Maitreya. Because of this important role, shrines to Kṣitigarbha often occupy a central role in temples, especially within the memorial halls or mausoleums.

Osore]], a location said to resemble [[Sanzu River|children's limbo]] in Japanese Buddhist tradition. There, Jizo is said to appear to rescue the children from the limbo and its iron club-welding [[oni|demons]]. Because of this, Jizo statues are often adorned with bibs, kerchiefs (pictured) and [[haori]]. In Jizo's right hand, he carries a [[khakkhara]] monk staff, and in his left, a [[cintamani|wish-fulfilling jewel]].]]

=== As a Brahmin maiden ===
The story of Kṣitigarbha was first described in the ''[[Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Pūrvapraṇidhāna Sūtra]]'', one of the most popular [[Mahayana sutras]]. This sutra is said to have been spoken by the Buddha towards the end of his life to the beings of the [[Trāyastriṃśa]] Heaven as a mark of gratitude and remembrance for his beloved mother, [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Maya]]. The ''[[Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Pūrvapraṇidhāna Sūtra]]'' begins, "[[Thus have I heard]]. Once the Buddha was abiding in Trayastrimsas Heaven in order to expound the Dharma to his mother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 1. The Sutra of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha's Fundamental Vows|url=http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/clubs/buddhism/ksitigarbha/chap1.html|website=www.sinc.sunysb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Pūrvapraṇidhāna Sūtra'' was first translated from [[Sanskrit]] into Chinese between 695-700 CE, during the [[Tang dynasty]], by the [[Tripiṭaka]] master [[Śikṣānanda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buswell|first=Robert E., ed.|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2014|isbn=|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Buddhist monk from [[Hotan|Khotan]] who also provided a new translation of the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'' and the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]''. However, some scholars have suspected that instead of being translated, this text may have originated in [[China]], since no Sanskrit manuscripts of this text have been found. Part of the reason for suspicion is that the text advocates filial piety, which was stereotypically associated with [[Chinese culture]]. It stated that Kṣitigarbha practised [[filial piety]] as a mortal, which eventually led to making great vows to save all sentient beings. Since then, other scholars such as [[Gregory Schopen]] have pointed out that Indian Buddhism also had traditions of filial piety.&lt;ref&gt;Schopen, Gregory. ''Filial Piety and the Monk in the Practice of Buddhism: A Question of 'Sinicization' Viewed from the Other Side.''&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there is no definitive evidence indicating either an Indian or Chinese origin for the text.

In the ''Kṣitigarbha Sūtra'', the Buddha states that in the distant past eons, Kṣitigarbha was a maiden of the [[Brahmin]] caste by the name of ''Sacred Girl''.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic, Louis. ''Buddhism: Flammarion Iconographic Guides.'' 1995. pp. 184-185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edkins, Joseph. ''Chinese Buddhism.'' 2003. pp. 225-226&lt;/ref&gt; This maiden was deeply troubled upon the death of her mother - who had often been slanderous towards the [[Three Jewels]]. To save her mother from the great tortures of hell, the girl sold whatever she had and used the money to buy offerings that she offered daily to the Buddha of her time, known as the Buddha of the Flower of Meditation and Enlightenment. She prayed fervently that her mother be spared the pains of hell and appealed to the Buddha for help.&lt;ref name="buddhanet1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/tstang-txt.htm |title=Ti Tsang P'usa: Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103093104/http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/tstang-txt.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While she was pleading for help at the temple, she heard the Buddha telling her to go home, sit down, and recite his name if she wanted to know where her mother was. She did as she was told and her consciousness was transported to a Hell realm, where she met a guardian who informed her that through her fervent prayers and pious offerings, her mother had accumulated much [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] and had already ascended to heaven. Sacred Girl was greatly relieved and would have been extremely happy, but the sight of the suffering she had seen in Hell touched her heart. She vowed to do her best to relieve beings of their suffering in her future lives for [[kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]].&lt;ref name="buddhanet1"/&gt;

{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}

There is a legend about how Kṣitigarbha manifested himself in China and chose his [[bodhimaṇḍa]] to be [[Mount Jiuhua]], one of the [[Sacred Mountains of China|Four Sacred Mountains of China]].

During the reign of [[Emperor Ming of Han]], Buddhism started to flourish, reaching its peak in the Tang and eventually spreading to Korea. At the time, monks and scholars arrived from those countries to seek the [[dharma]] in China. One of these pilgrims was a former prince from [[Silla]] named [[Kim Gyo-gak]], who became a monk under the Chinese name Dizang "Kṣitigarbha," pronounced ''Jijang'' in Korean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fo365.cn/jswz_view.asp?id=230 |title=释地藏金乔觉考 |publisher=Fo365.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209002310/http://www.fo365.cn/jswz_view.asp?id=230 |archivedate=December 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to Mount Jiuhua in present-day [[Anhui]]. After ascending, he decided to build a hut in a deep mountain area so that he could cultivate the dharma.

According to records, Jijang was bitten by a poisonous snake but he did not move, thus letting the snake go. A woman happened to pass by and gave the monk medicines to cure him of the venom, as well as a spring on her son's behalf. For a few years, Jijang continued to meditate in his hut, until one day, a scholar named Chu-Ke led a group of friends and family to visit the mountain. Noticing the monk meditating in the hut, they went and took a look at his condition. They had noticed that his bowl did not contain any food, and that his hair had grown back.

Taking pity on the monk, Chu-Ke decided to build a temple as an offering to him. The whole group descended the mountain immediately to discuss plans to build the temple. Mount Jiuhua was also property of a wealthy person called Elder Wen-Ke, who obliged to build a temple on his mountain. Therefore, Wen-Ke and the group ascended the mountain once more and asked Jijang how much land he needed.

Jijang replied that he needed a piece of land that could be covered fully by his [[Kasaya (clothing)|kasaya]]. Initially believing that a piece of sash could not provide enough land to build a temple, they were surprised when Jijang threw the kasaya in the air, and the robe expanded in size, covering the entire mountain. Elder Wen-Ke had then decided to renounce the entire mountain to Jijang, and became his protector. Sometime later, Wen-Ke's son also left secular life to become a monk.

Jijang lived in Mount Jiuhua for 75 years before passing away at the age of 99. Three years after his [[nirvana]], his tomb was opened, only to reveal that the body [[incorruptibility|had not decayed]]. Because Jijang led his wayplace with much difficulty, most people had the intuition to believe that he was indeed an incarnation of Kṣitigarbha.

Jijang's well-preserved, dehydrated body may still be viewed today at the monastery he built on Mount Jiuhua.

== Iconography ==

=== Traditional iconography ===
In Buddhist iconography, Kṣitigarbha is typically depicted with a shaven head, dressed in a monk's simple robes (unlike most other [[bodhisattva]]s, who are dressed like Indian royalty). In his left hand, Kṣitigarbha holds a [[cintamani]]; in his right hand, he holds a staff (called ''shakujo'' 錫杖 in Japanese), which is used to alert insects and small animals of his approach, so that he will not accidentally harm them. This staff is traditionally carried by Buddhist monks. In the Chinese tradition, Kṣitigarbha is sometimes depicted wearing a crown like the one worn by [[Vairocana]]. His image is similar to that of the fictional character [[Tang Sanzang]] from the classical novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', so observers sometimes mistake Kṣitigarbha for the latter.

Like other bodhisattvas, Kṣitigarbha usually is seen standing on a lotus base, symbolising his release from [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. Kṣitigarbha's face and head are also idealised, featuring the [[third eye]], elongated ears and the other standard attributes of a [[Buddhahood|buddha]].

=== Iconography in Japan ===
[[File:Jizo Children.jpg|thumb|right|Jizō [[bodhisattva]] statue at Mibudera temple in [[Japan]], depicted with children and bibs.]]

[[Tōsen-ji]] in [[Katsushika]], [[Tokyo]], contains the "Bound Jizō" of [[Ōoka Tadasuke]] fame, dating from the [[Edo period]]. When petitions are requested before Jizō, the petitioner ties a rope about the statue. When the wish is granted, the petitioner unties the rope. At the new year, the ropes of the ungranted wishes are cut by the temple priest.

The vandalism of a Jizō statue is the central theme of ''[[The Locker]]'', a 2004 Japanese horror and thriller film directed by [[Kei Horie]].

=== Kṣitigarbha as Lord of the Six Ways ===
[[File:Kṣitigarbha as Lord of the Six Ways (Stein Painting 19).jpg|thumb|left|Painting of Kṣitigarbha as the Lord of the Six Ways from [[Mogao Grottoes]] in [[Dunhuang]]]]
Another category of iconographic depiction is Kṣitigarbha as the Lord of the Six Ways, an allegorical representation of the Six Paths of Rebirth of the [[Desire realm]] (rebirth into hell, or as pretas, animals, asuras, men, and devas). The Six Paths are often depicted as six rays or beams radiating from the bodhisattva and accompanied by figurative representations of the Six Paths. Many of these depictions in China can be found in [[Shaanxi]] province, perhaps a result of Sanjie Jiao worship in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zhiru|title=The making of a savior bodhisattva: Dizang in Medieval China|year=2007|publisher=University of Hawai'i press|location=Honolulu (T.H.)|isbn=0824830458|pages=68|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Japanese variation of this depiction is the Six Jizo, six full sculptural manifestations of the bodhisattva. An example of this can be found in Konjikidō, the ‘Hall of Gold,’ in the [[Chūson-ji]] temple.

==In Buddhist traditions==

=== In China ===
[[File:Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Wood Statue.jpeg|thumb|230px|Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva statue depicted with a crown]]
[[Mount Jiuhua]] in [[Anhui]] is regarded as Kṣitigarbha's [[bodhimaṇḍa]]. It is one of the Four Sacred Buddhism Mountains in China, and at one time housed more than 300 temples. Today, 95 of these are open to the public. The mountain is a popular destination for pilgrims offering dedications to Kṣitigarbha.

In some areas, the admixture of traditional religions has led to Kṣitigarbha being also regarded as a [[Taoist]] deity, albeit his duties differ to what Kṣitigarbha does.{{citation needed| reason= For example, in Hong Kong and among [[overseas Chinese]] communities, his images are usually found in the memorial halls of Buddhist and Taoist temples.|date=December 2016}}

=== In Japan ===
In Japan, Kṣitigarbha, known as ''Jizō'', or respectfully as ''Ojizō-sama'', is one of the most loved of all Japanese divinities. His statues are a common sight, especially by roadsides and in graveyards. Traditionally, he is seen as the guardian of children, and in particular, children who died before their parents. He has been worshipped as the guardian of the souls of ''mizuko'', the souls of stillborn, [[miscarriage|miscarried]], or [[abortion|aborted fetuses]] in the ritual of [[mizuko kuyō]] (水子供養 "offering to water children"). In [[Japanese mythology]], it is said that the souls of children who die before their parents are unable to cross the mythical [[Sanzu River]] on their way to the afterlife because they have not had the chance to accumulate enough good deeds and because they have made the parents suffer. It is believed that Jizō saves these souls from having to pile stones eternally on the bank of the river as penance, by hiding them from demons in his robe, and letting them hear [[mantra]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Jizō statues are sometimes accompanied by a little pile of stones and pebbles, put there by people in the hope that it would shorten the time children have to suffer in the underworld. (The act is derived from the tradition of building [[stupa]]s as an act of merit-making.) The statues can sometimes be seen wearing tiny children's clothing or bibs, or with toys, put there by grieving parents to help their lost ones and hoping that Jizō would specially protect them. Sometimes the offerings are put there by parents to thank Jizō for saving their children from a serious illness. His features are commonly made more baby-like to resemble the children he protects.

As Jizō is seen as the saviour of souls who have to suffer in the underworld, his statues are common in cemeteries. He is also believed to be one of the protective deities of travellers, the ''[[dōsojin]]'', and roadside statues of Jizō are a common sight in Japan. Firefighters are also believed to be under his protection.

=== In Southeast Asia ===
[[File:Phra_Malai_Manuscript_LACMA_M.76.93.2_(18_of_21).jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of Phra Malai from the ''Phra Malai Manuscript'' of Thailand, c. 1860-1880]]

In [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]], the story of a [[bhikkhu]] named [[Phra Malai]] with similar qualities to Kṣitigarbha is well known throughout [[Southeast Asia]], especially in [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]]. Legend has it that he was an [[arhat]] from [[Sri Lanka]] who achieved great supernatural powers through his own merit and meditation. He is also honoured as a successor to [[Maudgalyayana|Mahāmoggallāna]], the Buddha's disciple foremost for his supernatural attainments. In the story, this pious and compassionate monk descends to [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Hell]] to give teachings &amp; comfort the suffering hell-beings there. He also learns how the hell-beings are punished according to their sins in the different hells.&lt;ref name=Ginsburg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginsburg|first1=Henry|title=Thai art and culture : historic manuscripts from western collections|date=2000|publisher=Univ. of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|isbn=978-0824823672|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mantra ==
[[File:Jizo Toi gold mine.jpg|thumb|Statue of Jizō in the [[Toi gold mine]], [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], [[Japan]].]]
In [[Shingon Buddhism]] and other schools of [[Chinese Esoteric Buddhism]], the mantra of Kṣitigarbha comes from the "Treasury of Mantras" section of the ''[[Mahavairocana Tantra]]''. The effect of this mantra is producing the "[[Samadhi]] Realm of Adamantine Indestructible Conduct." This mantra is the following:&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Giebel, Rolf.

The Legend of the Humming of the Sai-no-Kawara, by [[Lafcadio Hearn]]:{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

:But lo! the teacher Jizô appears,
:All gently he comes, and says to the weeping infants:
:"Be not afraid, dears! be never fearful!
:Poor little souls, your lives were brief indeed!
:Too soon you were forced to make the weary journey to the Meido,
:The long journey to the region of the dead!
:Trust to me! I am your father and mother in the Meido,
:Father of all children in the region of the dead."
:And he folds the skirt of his shining robe about them;
:So graciously takes he pity on the infants.
:To those who cannot walk he stretches forth his strong shakujô,
:And he pets the little ones, caresses them, takes them to his loving bosom.
:So graciously he takes pity on the infants.
:Namo Jizo Bosatsu!

== In popular culture ==
* In [[Super Mario Bros. 3]], the "Tanooki Suit" power-up enables the player to temporarily transform into a stone statue of Kṣitigarbha. These Jizo statues appear once more, under that name, in Super Mario Odyssey, where they look very similar to the form Mario received when he utilized the Tanooki Suit's transformation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5129">'''Lawrence Bush''' (born 1951) is the author of several books of [[Jews|Jewish]] fiction and non-fiction, including  ''Waiting for God: The Spiritual Explorations of a Reluctant Atheist'' and ''Bessie: A Novel of Love and Revolution''.

He was born in New York City, attended [[Springfield Gardens High School]], and holds a B.A. from [[City College of New York]]. In addition to writing and editing, he has worked as a puppeteer and school music teacher.

==''Jewish Currents''==
Bush edits ''[[Jewish Currents]]'', an independent, progressive magazine founded in 1946 and  promotes Jewish identity as “a counterculture . . . in many ways antithetical to what drives our country today”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;“Judaism as a Counterculture,” [[Jewish Currents]], September–October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 
:“Throughout the conservative onslaught of the past  three decades,” Bush has editorialized in Jewish Currents, “we have argued repeatedly that Jewish identification with the have-nots is more consistent with our people’s history, tradition, self-interest, and prospects for continuity, than the currying of favor with  the powers-that-be — especially when those powers resemble nothing more than Pharaoh, the imperial oppressor of Biblical Egypt.”&lt;ref&gt;“The Tenacity of Jewish Liberalism,” Editorial, [[Jewish Currents]], January–February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
He is also the editor of the daily blog ''JEWDAYO,'' discussing events from Jewish life and history on the anniversary of their occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishcurrents.org/blog/jewdayo]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the entries from the first year of the  blog, 2010,  were collected into a printed daybook ''Jewdayo''.&lt;ref&gt;''JEWDAYO: a daily blast of knowledge and pride''  Blue Thread Communications, 2012 {{ISBN|978-1-934730-94-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other writings==
Bush is the former editor of ''[[Reconstructionism Today]]'', the quarterly magazine of the Jewish [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist movement]]. He was co-editor of ''[[Jews. (magazine)|Jews.]]'', an arts magazine and mail-art experience publIshed from 1999-2004. His writings have appeared in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]'', ''[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]]'', ''[[Reform Judaism (magazine)|Reform Judaism]]'' and [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'' magazine]], among others. He provided updating and commentary for the millennial edition of [[Leo Rosten]]'s classic, ''[[The Joys of Yiddish]]''.&lt;ref name=WCI&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/lccn-n82-52207 WorldCat Identities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush served for more than a decade as speechwriter for Rabbi [[Alexander Schindler]], the late leader of Reform Judaism in America. Bush has described himself as "an atheist who has nevertheless worked intimately in Jewish religious institutions as a writer and editor for much of my adult life.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/092007/edcolTheRabbiAnd.html The Rabbi and the Atheist]", by Andrew Silow-Carroll&lt;/ref&gt;

:“There is a progressive pulse at the core of Jewish thought,” Bush has written. “It is this pulse — humanistic, engaged with the world, responsive to cultural evolution, dissatisfied with the status quo — that most keeps me engaged with Jewish identity and committed to its nurture. Notwithstanding contrary interpretations or even widespread indifference to the philosophical riches of Judaism, I’m drawn to the view of [[I.L. Peretz]], who wrote that Jews who ‘wish to be true to ourselves’ should be asking ‘vital questions’ about ‘conscience, freedom, culture, ethics.’ &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2011, together with cartoonist [[Richard Codor]], Bush created the humorous ''Babushkin's Catalogue of Jewish Inventions'' &lt;ref&gt;Bush, Lawrence, Dick Codor, and Bruce Sager. ''Babushkin's Catalogue of Jewish Inventions.'' Accord, N.Y.: Babushkin's Digest, 1988?. OCLC 80198553&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lecrae Devaughn Moore''' (born October 9, 1979), [[Mononymous person|mononymously]] known as '''Lecrae''', is an American [[Christian hip hop]] recording artist, songwriter, record producer, and actor. He is the president, co-owner and co-founder of the independent record label [[Reach Records]], and the co-founder and president of the now-defunct non-profit organization ReachLife Ministries. To date, he has released seven studio albums and three mixtapes as a solo artist, and has released three studio albums, a remix album, and one EP as the leader of the hip hop group [[116 Clique]]. He produced much of his earlier material along with other early Reach Records releases. Lecrae, in reference to his label as a Christian rapper, has stated that his music is just hip hop, though it reflects his Christian faith. In May 2016, Lecrae signed to [[Columbia Records]] in a joint deal between his label and Columbia.

Lecrae's debut recording, ''[[Real Talk (Lecrae album)|Real Talk]]'', was released in 2004 through Reach Records. His third solo album, ''[[Rebel (Lecrae album)|Rebel]]'', released in 2008, became the first Christian hip hop album to reach No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Gospel chart. ''[[Rehab (Lecrae album)|Rehab]]'' followed in 2010, and Lecrae began attracting mainstream attention when he performed at the 2011 [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] Hip Hop Awards Cypher and appeared on the [[Statik Selektah]] song "Live &amp; Let Live" from ''[[Population Control (album)|Population Control]]''. On May 10, 2012, Lecrae released his first mixtape, ''[[Church Clothes]]'', which was hosted by [[DJ Don Cannon]].&lt;ref name="illhype"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://illhype.com/news/2012/04/26/illhype-exclusive-lecrae-announces-church-clothes-mixtape-hosted-by-don-cannon/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: Lecrae Announces Church Clothes Mixtape Hosted By Don Cannon |publisher=illHype |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered his breakthrough into mainstream hip hop, the mixtape was downloaded over 100,000 times in less than 48 hours. His sixth studio album, ''[[Gravity (Lecrae album)|Gravity]]'', came out on September 4, 2012, and has been called the most important album in Christian hip hop history by [[Rapzilla]] and ''[[Atlanta Daily World]]''.&lt;ref name="rapzillareview2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapzilla.com/rz/reviews/4965-review-lecrae-gravity|title=Review – Lecrae 'Gravity'|last=Goss|first=Armond|date=August 28, 2012|work=Rapzilla|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atlantadailyworld.com/2013/09/22/hip-hop-s-savior-atlanta-s-newest-rap-star-lecrae-prepares-to-put-on-his-church-clothes-again/|title=Hip Hop’s Savior?

Lecrae received nominations for Artist of the Year at the [[43rd GMA Dove Awards|43rd]], [[44th GMA Dove Awards|44th]], 45th, and [[46th GMA Dove Awards|46th]] [[GMA Dove Award]]s, the last of which he won, and for [[BET Award for Best Gospel Artist|Best Gospel Artist]] at the [[BET Awards 2013|2013]] and [[BET Awards 2015|2015 BET Awards]], the latter of which he won, a first for a rap artist. Lecrae's filmography includes a role in the television film ''A Cross to Bear'' (2012) and a brief role as Dr. Malmquist in the comedy film ''[[Believe Me (film)|Believe Me]]'' (2014). In the social sphere, Lecrae has advocated for the preservation of responsibility and fatherhood as a value among men in the United States, and in 2013 partnered with [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Joshua DuBois]] in the multimedia initiative ''This Is Fatherhood'' as part of the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]]'s Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative. He has also presented on and written about [[Race relations in the United States|racial tension]] and [[Racism in the United States|injustice]] in the United States.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Born and raised by his single mother in Southern [[Houston, Texas]], Lecrae moved often early in life, living in [[San Diego]], [[Denver]], and [[Dallas]]. He has stated that he would go to church with his Christian grandmother, but considered it for "older people" and said it "wasn't for me."&lt;ref name="iamsecond"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first = Lecrae |title= Seconds |url=http://www.iamsecond.com/seconds/lecrae/|work= [[I Am Second]]|accessdate= July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lecrae never met his father, who ended up becoming a drug addict. In the song "Good, Bad, Ugly", Lecrae reveals that when he was almost eight, a female baby sitter sexually molested him, an incident which Lecrae believes distorted his view of sexuality, influencing his later promiscuous lifestyle.&lt;ref name="gbu"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Lecrae (Performer and lyricist) |year=2014 |title=Good, Bad, Ugly |medium=Musical song |accessdate=September 30, 2014 |location=Atlanta |publisher=[[Reach Records]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiencing abuse and neglect during his childhood, Lecrae used his ability to [[rapping|rap]] as a source of significance. According to Lecrae, his grandmother would not allow him to watch rap music videos on television, but he would sneak in late at night. It was in these videos that Lecrae found individuals to look up to. Lecrae states that "there were no [[Martin Luther King]]s or [[Malcolm X]]s, they had all passed away so I had [[Tupac Shakur|Tupac]]." After being shown a gun by his uncle, Lecrae began looking up to [[gangster]]s and turned to a life of crime. Lecrae remembers taking a [[BB gun]] and standing in the street pointing it to a car, frightening the female driver, simply for fun.&lt;ref name="iamsecond" /&gt; At 11 years old, he started writing music for a rhythm and blues group formed by some neighbors. His first track, written for a neighborhood crush, emulated the style of Tupac, [[Outkast]], and [[A Tribe Called Quest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2016/11/10/1-rapper-channels-his-sins-into-his-musical-message.html|title=Rapper Lecrae channels his sins into his musical message|newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 16, he started taking drugs, fighting, was arrested in high school for stealing, and eventually ended up on a gang list.&lt;ref name = iamsecond /&gt; Lecrae tried "pretty much every drug there was to try" except for heroin and [[crack cocaine]].&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;{{cite web | last = Wete |first= Brian| title= Interview: Lecrae Talks About Going From "Crazy Crae" To Christian Rapper|url= http://www.complex.com/music/2012/06/interview-lecrae | work = [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=July 14, 2012|format=Web|date=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[CNN]], he became a drug dealer and used the Bible that his grandmother gave him as a good luck charm.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/10/for-the-rapper-a-new-life-a-new-message/|title=For the rapper, a new life, a new message|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being arrested for drug possession, the officer saw the Bible and let Lecrae go on a promise that he would agree to live by it.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; He eventually turned from drugs to alcohol consumption and a party lifestyle and became a "misfit of a person."&lt;ref name=iamsecond /&gt; He has described himself during this period as a thrill-seeker, he would pull stunts such as jumping from a third-story building, and gained the nickname "Crazy 'Crae".&lt;ref name=complex /&gt; Encouraged by his concerned mother to read his Bible, Lecrae said that "I remember ripping the pages out of the Bible and throwing it on the floor. I don't want this Bible. I couldn't wrap my hands around this being true or real." He began to drink and smoke more and look for more women "as the emptiness became more profound."&lt;ref name=iamsecond /&gt; At age 17, his personal, financial, and relationship troubles convinced him that he was at a "dead end."&lt;ref name= complex /&gt;&lt;ref name="familychristian"&gt;{{cite web|title= Pulling No Punches – an interview with Lecrae|url = http://www.familychristian.com/blog/pulling-no-punches-an-interview-with-lecrae|work=Family Christian|accessdate=July 14, 2012| publisher =[[Family Christian Stores]]|date=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanting to do what he considered the mature thing, through the influence of his grandmother, he desired to start attending church.&lt;ref name=familychristian /&gt; A girl Lecrae attended high school with was there, and she invited him to a Bible study, where he met Darragh, his future wife.&lt;ref name=familychristian /&gt; Lecrae was surprised to find that the members of the Bible study "were just people like me.  They read the same books and listened to the same music. Their character was just different. They were loving and that's really what drew me in."&lt;ref name = complex /&gt; Lecrae says that it was at age 19 that he finally decided to live for God, though "it wasn't overnight" and he "spent a lot of time making bad decisions."&lt;ref name=complex /&gt;

====Conversion====
Lecrae attended a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest was to meet girls and experience the big city. When he arrived at the conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group [[The Cross Movement]]. Lecrae says that he saw "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and I had never seen that before." After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], Lecrae says that he remembers articulating "God get me out of this, don't kill me; do whatever you have to do to get me out of this, just don't kill me."&lt;ref name = iamsecond /&gt;&lt;ref name="reach"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reachrecords.com/artists/show/Lecrae |title=Reach Records |publisher=Reach Records | accessdate = May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured.&lt;ref name=iamsecond /&gt; Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the [[University of North Texas]], with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus.&lt;ref name=reach /&gt; He started volunteering and performing at a [[juvenile detention center]], and the reception he received convinced him that offering "hope and encouragement" through music was what he wanted to do.&lt;ref name=iamsecond /&gt; However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets.&lt;ref name=gbu /&gt; In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.&lt;ref name=gbu /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2014/10/lecrae-opens-about-being-molested-child/|title=Lecrae Opens Up About Being Molested As A Child|date=October 15, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also stated, "I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. I'm a social anthropologist. If I never been homeless, let me try to be homeless for a week and soak up that information. More like a method actor. So for me it's spending time with people and talking about things from their perspective."&lt;ref&gt;Rolland, David.

[[File:Lecrae on fatherhood and sex trafficking.webm|left|thumb|Video in which Lecrae discusses the importance of fatherhood]]
In 2011, 116 Clique and ReachLife Ministries, both headed by Lecrae, launched a media campaign entitled ''Man Up'', intended to mentor male urban youths on fatherhood and biblical manhood.&lt;ref name=manup /&gt; It features concert tours and a curriculum centered on a short film and a studio album, both titled ''Man Up'', and since 2012 has also featured a string of conference events.&lt;ref name=manup /&gt;

In May 2013, Lecrae partnered with [[NBA]] player [[Dwyane Wade]], filmmaker Art Hooker, and [[Joshua DuBois]], the former head of the [[White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships|Office of Faith Based and Neighborhood Partnerships]] under the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]], to create the national media campaign ''This Is Fatherhood'', an initiative "devoted to restoring America's commitment to healthy fatherhood."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wltx.com/news/watercooler/article/237346/363/Dwyane-Wade-Launches-Fatherhood-Challenge|title = Dwyane Wade &amp; Hip-Hop Artist Lecrae Launch Fatherhood Challenge|last = Brown|first = Celeste|date = May 20, 2013|publisher = [[WLTX]]|accessdate = July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://rapzilla.com/rz/news/1-press/6343-dwyane-wade-and-grammy-winning-artist-lecrae-join-forces-to-champion-fatherhood|title = Dwyane Wade and Grammy Winning Artist Lecrae Join Forces to Champion Fatherhood|last = Rapzilla|date = May 24, 2013|website = [[Rapzilla]]|publisher = Philip Rood and Chad Horton|accessdate = July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign began on May 1 with a "This is Fatherhood Challenge", in which contestants could submit videos, songs, and essays about fatherhood through June 10. The winners received cash prizes and a trip to Washington, D.C., for a ceremony on [[Father's Day]]. In addition, Lecrae offered studio time and mentoring to the grand prize winner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lecrae, Wade, DuBois, [[Jay Z]], and U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] all made appearances in the campaign's promotional public service announcements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Lecrae has also contributed op-ed articles to ''Billboard'' dealing with [[Racism in the United States|race relations in the United States]], including the 2014 [[Ferguson unrest]], 2015 [[Charleston church shooting]], and 2016 shootings of [[Shooting of Alton Sterling|Alton Stirling]], [[Shooting of Philando Castile|Philando Castile]], and [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|six Dallas police officers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lecrae on Ferguson: 'The System We Have in Place Has Biases'|url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6327837/lecrae-ferguson|accessdate = August 10, 2015|website = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|first = Lecrae|last = Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lecrae Op-Ed: Charleston Shooting Comes From Deeply Rooted Racism &amp; Injustice|url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6605623/lecrae-charleston-shooting-op-ed|accessdate = August 10, 2015|website = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last = Moore|first = Lecrae}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7431179/lecrae-humility-race-relations|title=Lecrae: Humility is the Key to Understanding Race Relations: Guest Essay|newspaper=Billboard|access-date=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these articles, Lecrae has called for understanding and empathy across racial divides and willingness to listen to the oppressed, and also pointed out the need for spiritual healing through Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lecrae Says Christians Should Build Relationships With People Whose Cultural Perspective Frustrates Them|url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/lecrae-says-christians-should-build-relationships-with-people-whose-cultural-perspective-frustrates-them-141901/|accessdate = August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lecrae Speaks Out on Michael Brown Verdict; Christians Should 'Empathize' With Ferguson, Finds Unsympathetic 'Churchianity' Hurtful [VIDEO]|url = http://www.breathecast.com/articles/rapper-lecrae-speaks-out-michael-browns-case-verdict-christians-empathize-ferguson-22068/|accessdate = August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid 2016, Lecrae did a talk about racial reconciliation at [[Yale University]], titled "Knowledge through Narrative: Bridging the Racial Divide in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://timothydwight.yalecollege.yale.edu/news/notes-and-news-week-april-25-2016 |title= Notes and News - Week of April 25, 2016 |work= Timothy Dwight College |accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7431179/lecrae-humility-race-relations |title= Lecrae: Humility is the Key to Understanding Race Relations: Guest Essay |work= Billboard |accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNSyAYRUPlk |title= Knowledge Though Narrative: Bridging the Racial Divide in America--Lecrae Talk at Yale |work= Youtube |accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spoke on hip hop culture at a Nashville TEDx conference, decrying the misogyny and violence rampant in much of hip hop's lyrics but advocating for hip hop to be used as an agent for social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Heroes and Villains: Is hip-hop a cancer or a cure?

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Maddalena Panattieri''' (1443 – 13 October 1503) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Nun|professed religious]] and a professed member of the [[Order of Preachers|Sisters of Penance of Saint Dominic]] since her late adolescence.&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicsaints.info/blessed-magdalen-panattieri/|title=Blessed Magdalen Panattieri|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panattieri was a [[Stigmata|stigmatic]] and received visions during her life with one in particular being the French invasion of the Italian peninsula.&lt;ref name=CF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicfire.blogspot.com.au/2012/10/blessed-magdalen-panattieri.html|title=Blessed Magdalen Panattieri|date=13 October 2012|publisher=Catholic Fire|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as a [[Catechism|catechist]] to children and was noted for her simple existence.&lt;ref name=OI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orderofpreachersindependent.org/2014/10/12/blessed-magdalen-dei-panattieri/|title=Blessed Magdalen dei Panattieri|date=12 October 2014|publisher=The Order of Preachers, Independent|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panattieri was beatified on 26 September 1897 after [[Pope Leo XII]] confirmed that there was a longstanding 'cultus' (or popular devotion) to the late religious.&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90480|title=Blessed Maddalena Panattieri|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Maddalena Panattieri was born in [[Trino]] in 1443 and as a child fostered a great devotion to [[Catherine of Siena|Saint Catherine of Siena]]. She joined the [[Order of Preachers]] not long before 1463 as part of the tertiaries rather than as a formal religious; this was considered unusual since members were mainly widows and older women.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=CF/&gt; She made a private vow as a child to remain [[Chastity|chaste]].&lt;ref name=OI/&gt;

Panattieri lived at home alongside her relations and devoted her time to the care of both the poor and the ill and she would often give talks to children (she was quite fond of children) while later speaking with [[priests]] and [[nuns]]. She would instruct these children in [[catechism]] which led to older people flocking to hear her speak on the subject. Panattieri also received the [[stigmata]] later in life though kept this a secret.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; The reform movement of [[Raymond of Capua|Blessed Raimondo da Capua]] of the order saw the religious promote it in Trino. [[God]] also revealed to her the coming French invasion of the Italian peninsula though she would not live to see it.&lt;ref name=CF/&gt;

She often spent her mornings in [[Eucharistic Adoration]] while her afternoons saw her administering to both the ill and the poor; she became noted for her austerities which included wearing a rough woolen shirt and for her long fasts.&lt;ref name=CF/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; When her brother kept getting into trouble (and his conduct exceeded all patience) she would fall to her knees before a [[Crucifix]] and would beg for God to intervene and help her brother. Through her efforts the order was inspired to undertake a more strict observance which led to [[Sebastian Maggi|Blessed Sebastiano Maggi]] - from [[Milan]] - coming in 1490 to inaugurate this at her request.&lt;ref name=OI/&gt;

On one occasion a rich councilor from Milan - who harbored great hatred towards the faith - was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] and he hit her across the face in public and called her names. She dropped to her knees and said: "Brother here is the other cheek. I give it to you in love of [[Jesus Christ]]" which infuriated the man further. But justice was too late for the man died a violent death from a painful and incurable disease not long after this incident.&lt;ref name=OI/&gt;

Panattieri died on 13 October 1503 in Trino. On her deathbed she said: "I could not be happy in Heaven if you were not there too" to those assembled near her bedside.&lt;ref name=CF/&gt; She sang "Jesus our Redeemer" and the "Ave Maria" prior to her death. Her remains were found in 1964 and transferred in 1970.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

==Beatification==
Panattieri received formal beatification from [[Pope Leo XII]] on 26 September 1827 once the pontiff confirmed that a 'cultus' (or popular devotion) to Panattieri existed and endured since her death.

'''Meera''', also known as '''Meera Bai''' or '''Mirabai'''&lt;ref name=brit1&gt;{{cite web|title=Mira Bai|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Mira-Bai|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1498-1546) was a [[Hindu]] [[Mysticism|mystic]] poet of the Bhakti movement. She referred to the Lord, whom she saw as her husband, with different names like Satguru, Prabhu Ji, Girdhar Nagar, Krishna. She even called him the husband of her soul. Due to her mother, her in-laws disapproved of her public singing and dancing as she belonged to a Royal Family of Mewar and was a princess. But she had too much love for her god and sacrificed everything, even her family, for god and attained Moksha through [[Bhakti Yoga]]. She is a celebrated [[Bhakti movement|Bhakti]] saint, particularly in the North Indian Hindu tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechelis (2004), The Graceful Guru, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195145373}}, pages 21-23, 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neeti Sadarangani (2004), Bhakti Poetry in Medieval India: Its Inception, Cultural Encounter and Impact, Sarup &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|978-8176254366}}, pages 76-80&lt;/ref&gt;

Meera Bai was born into family of Merta, [[Rajasthan]], India. She is mentioned in [[Bhaktamal]], confirming that she was widely known and a cherished figure in the [[Bhakti movement]] culture by about 1600 CE.&lt;ref name=asher&gt;Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot (2006), India before Europe, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521809047}}, page 109&lt;/ref&gt; Most legends about Meera mention her fearless disregard for social and family conventions, her devotion to Lord 
Krishna, her treating Krishna as her husband, and she being persecuted by her [[in-law]]s for her religious devotion.&lt;ref name=ushamiralife/&gt;&lt;ref name=asher/&gt; She has been the subject of numerous folk tales and [[hagiography|hagiographic]] legends, which are inconsistent or widely different in details.&lt;ref name=ushamiralife/&gt;&lt;ref name=nancy&gt;Nancy Martin-Kershaw (2014), Faces of the Feminine in Ancient, Medieval, and Modern India (Editor: Mandakranta Bose), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195352771}}, pages 162-178&lt;/ref&gt;
Thousands of devotional poems in passionate praise of Lord [[Krishna]] are attributed to Meera in the Indian tradition, but just a few hundred are believed to be authentic by scholars, and the earliest written records suggest that except for two poems, most were written down only in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=hawley&gt;John Stratton Hawley (2002), Asceticism (Editors: Vincent Wimbush, Richard Valantasi), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195151381}}, pages 301-302&lt;/ref&gt; Many poems attributed to Meera were likely composed later by others who admired Meera. These poems are commonly known as ''[[bhajan]]s'', and are popular across India.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195148923}}, page 254&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu temples, such as in Chittorgarh fort, are dedicated to Mira Bai's memory.&lt;ref name=ushamiralife/&gt; Legends about Meera's life, of contested authenticity, have been the subject of movies, comic strips and other popular literature in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195148923}}, page 242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Rajasthan-Chittore Garh 09.jpg|left|230px|thumb|''Meera's'' temple to [[Krishna]] at [[Chittor Fort]], Rajasthan]]
Authentic records about Meera are not available, and scholars have attempted to establish Meera's biography from secondary literature that mention her, and wherein dates and other moments. Meera unwillingly married [[Bhoj Raj]], the crown prince of [[Mewar]], in 1516.&lt;ref name=usha13&gt;Usha Nilsson (1997), Mira bai, Sahitya Akademi, {{ISBN|978-8126004119}}, pages 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Martin-Kershaw (2014), Faces of the Feminine in Ancient, Medieval, and Modern India (Editor: Mandakranta Bose), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195352771}}, page 165&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband was wounded in one of the ongoing Hindu-Muslim wars of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1518, and he died of battle wounds in 1521. Both her own father and her father-in-law were killed within a few years after her husband,&lt;ref name=ushamiralife/&gt; during a war with the Islamic army of Babur – the founder of [[Mughal Empire]] in the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=kinsley&gt;David Kinsley (1997), Tradition and Modernity in Bhakti Movements (Editor: J Lele), Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004063709}}, pages 88-89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SR Bakshi (2002), Mirabai: Saints of India, Criterion, {{ISBN|978-8179380239}}, pages 42-45, 282-283&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of her father-in-law, Vikram Singh became the ruler of Mewar. According to a popular legend, her in-laws tried many times to execute her, such as sending Meera a glass of poison and telling her it was nectar or sending her a basket with a snake instead of flowers.&lt;ref name=brit1/&gt;&lt;ref name=usha13/&gt; According to the hagiographic legends, she was not harmed in either case, with the snake miraculously becoming a Krishna idol (or a garland of flowers depending on the version).&lt;ref name=nancy/&gt;&lt;ref name=usha13/&gt; In another version of these legends, she is asked by Vikram Singh to go drown herself, which she tries but she finds herself floating on water.&lt;ref name=usha17&gt;Usha Nilsson (1997), Mira bai, Sahitya Akademi, {{ISBN|978-8126004119}}, pages 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another legend states that the Mughal emperor [[Akbar]] came with [[Tansen]] to visit Meera and presented a pearl necklace, but scholars doubt this ever happened because Tansen joined Akbar's court in 1562, 15 years after she died.&lt;ref name=usha17/&gt;
Similarly, some stories state that [[Raidas]] was her guru (teacher), but there is no corroborating historical evidence for this and the difference of over 100 years in the birth years for Ravidas and Meera suggest this to be unlikely.&lt;ref name=usha17/&gt;

The three different oldest records known as of 2014 that mention Meera,&lt;ref&gt;These are Munhata Nainsi's Khyat from [[Jodhpur]], Prem Ambodh from [[Amritsar]] and Nabhadas's Chappay from [[Varanasi]]; see: JS Hawley and GS Mann (2014), Culture and Circulation: Literature in Motion in Early Modern India (Editors: Thomas De Bruijn and Allison Busch), Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004264472}}, pages 131-135&lt;/ref&gt; all from the 17th century and written within 150 years of Meera's death, neither mention anything about her childhood or circumstances of her marriage to Bhojraj, nor do they mention that the people who persecuted her were her in-laws or from some Rajput royal family.&lt;ref&gt;JS Hawley and GS Mann (2014), Culture and Circulation: Literature in Motion in Early Modern India (Editors: Thomas De Bruijn and Allison Busch), Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004264472}}, pages 131-135&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Martin-Kershaw states that to the extent Meera was challenged and persecuted, religious or social conventions were unlikely to have been the cause, rather the likely cause were political chaos and military conflicts between the Rajput kingdom and the Mughal Empire.

Other stories state that Mira Bai left the kingdom of Mewar and went on pilgrimages. In her last years, Meera lived in [[Dwarka]] or [[Vrindavan]], where legends state she miraculously disappeared by merging into an idol of Krishna in 1547.&lt;ref name=ushamiralife/&gt;&lt;ref name=brit1/&gt; While miracles are contested by scholars for the lack of historical evidence, it is widely acknowledged that Meera dedicated her life to Hindu deity Krishna, composing songs of devotion and was one of the most important poet-saint of the Bhakti movement period.&lt;ref name=brit1/&gt;&lt;ref name=usha17/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John S Hawley (2005), Three Bhakti Voices: Mirabai, Surdas and Kabir in Their Times and Ours, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195670851}}, pages 128-130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
[[File:Krishna N Radha.jpg|thumb|230px|Most of Meera's poems are dedicated to God in the form of Krishna (left), calling him the Dark One or the Mountain Lifter. Some Meera songs include Radha (right), the mythical lover of Krishna. Al lher poems have philosophical connotations.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195148923}}, page 244&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Meera.png|alt=OM|thumb|341x341px|MEERA BAI]]
A number of compositions by Meera Bai continue to be sung today in India, mostly as devotional songs (''bhajans'') though nearly all of them have a philosophical connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Subramanian |first1=VK |title=Mystic songs of Meera (in Hindi and English) |date=1 February 2005 |publisher=Abhinav publications |isbn=8170174589 |url=https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/mystic-songs-of-meera-with-english-transliteration-and-translation-IDF197/ |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her most popular compositions remains "''Paayoji maine Ram Ratan dhan paayo''" (पायो जी मैंने राम रतन धन पायो। ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lyrics - Ram Ratan Dhan Paayo (Lata Mangeshkar rendition) |url=http://tophindilyrics.com/shri-ram-bhajan/%e0%a4%aa%e0%a4%be%e0%a4%af%e0%a5%8b-%e0%a4%9c%e0%a5%80-%e0%a4%ae%e0%a5%88%e0%a4%82%e0%a4%a8%e0%a5%87-%e0%a4%b0%e0%a4%be%e0%a4%ae-%e0%a4%b0%e0%a4%a4%e0%a4%a8-%e0%a4%a7%e0%a4%a8-%e0%a4%aa%e0%a4%be/ |website=www.tophindilyrics.com |publisher=Top Hindi Lyrics |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The poetry of Meera : a compendium of her songs translated in English |publisher=Poetry Hunter |url=https://www.poemhunter.com/i/ebooks/pdf/mirabai_2012_7.pdf |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meera's poems are lyrical ''padas'' (metric verses) in [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]] language.&lt;ref name=usha17/&gt; While thousands of verses are attributed to her, scholars are divided in their opinion as to how many of them were actually penned by Meera herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Meera ke bhajan (Hindi) |url=https://hindividya.com/mirabai-poems/ |website=www.hindividya.com |publisher=Hindi Vidya |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no surviving manuscripts of her poetry from her time, and the earliest records with two poems credited to her are from early 18th-century, more than 150 years after she died.&lt;ref name="hawley" /&gt; 

===Hindi and Rajasthani===
The largest collection of poems credited to her are in 19th-century manuscripts. Scholars have attempted to establish authenticity based on both the poem and Meera being mentioned in other manuscripts as well as from style, linguistics and form.&lt;ref name="hawley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="edwinsongs"&gt;Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195148923}}, pages 244-245&lt;/ref&gt; John Stratton Hawley cautions, "When one speaks of the poetry of Mirabai, then, there is always an element of enigma. (...) there must always remain a question about whether there is any real relation between the poems we cite and a historical Mira."&lt;ref&gt;John Stratton Hawley (2002), Asceticism (Editors: Vincent Wimbush, Richard Valantasi), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195151381}}, page 302&lt;/ref&gt;

In her poems, Krishna is a yogi and lover, and she herself is a yogini ready to take her place by his side into a spiritual marital bliss.&lt;ref name=hawley/&gt; Meera's style combines impassioned mood, defiance, longing, anticipation, joy and ecstasy of union, always centered on Krishna.&lt;ref name=edwinsongs/&gt;

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
My [[Krishna|Dark One]] has gone to an alien land.
He has left me behind, he's never returned, he's never sent me a single word.
So I've stripped off my ornaments, jewels and adornments, cut my hair from my head.
And put on holy garments, all on his account, seeking him in all four directions.
Mira: unless she meets the Dark One, her Lord, she doesn't even want to live.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Mira Bai|Translated by John Stratton Hawley&lt;ref&gt;John Stratton Hawley (2002), Asceticism (Editors: Vincent Wimbush, Richard Valantasi), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195151381}}, page 303&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meera speaks of a personal relationship with Krishna as her lover, lord and mountain lifter. The characteristic of her poetry is complete surrender.

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
After making me fall for you so hard, where are you going?
Until the day I see you, no repose: my life, like a fish washed on shore, flails in agony.
For your sake I'll make myself a yogini, I'll hurl myself to death on the saw of Kashi.
Mira's Lord is the clever Mountain Lifter, and I am his, a slave to his lotus feet.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Mira Bai|Translated by John Stratton Hawley&lt;ref&gt;John Stratton Hawley (2002), Asceticism (Editors: Vincent Wimbush, Richard Valantasi), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195151381}}, page 304&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meera is often classed with the northern Sant bhaktis who spoke of a [[Nirguna brahman|formless]] divinity.&lt;ref name="Hinduism 1996, Page 144"&gt;''An Introduction to Hinduism'', Cambridge 1996, Page 144, by Gavin Flood&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikh literature===
''Prem Ambodh Pothi'', a text attributed to [[Guru Gobind Singh]] and completed in 1693 CE, includes poetry of Mira Bai as one of sixteen historic ''bhakti sants'' important to Sikhism.&lt;ref&gt;JS Hawley and GS Mann (2014), Culture and Circulation: Literature in Motion in Early Modern India (Editors: Thomas De Bruijn and Allison Busch), Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004264472}}, pages 113-136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
{{Hinduism}}
Scholars acknowledge that Meera was one of the central poet-saints of the Bhakti movement, during a difficult period in Indian history filled with religious conflicts. Yet, they simultaneously question the extent to which Meera was a canonical projection of social imagination that followed, where she became a symbol of people's suffering and a desire for an alternative.&lt;ref name=dirkparita&gt;Dirk Wiemann (2008), Genres of Modernity: Contemporary Indian Novels in English, Rodopi, {{ISBN|978-9042024939}}, pages 148-149&lt;/ref&gt; Dirk Wiemann, quoting Parita Mukta, states,

{{Quote|
If one accepts that someone very akin to the Mira legend [about persecution and her devotion] existed as an actual social being, the power of her convictions broke the brutal feudal relationships that existed at that time. The Mira Bai of the popular imagination, then, is an intensely [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] figure by virtue of that anticipatory radical democracy which propels Meera out of the [[historicity]] that remains nonetheless ascribed to her. She goes beyond the shadowy realms of the past to inhabit the very core of a future which is embodied within the suffering of a people who seek an alternative.
|Dirk Wiemann / Parita Mukta| On Meera&lt;ref name=dirkparita/&gt;&lt;ref name=parita&gt;Parita Mukta (1998), Upholding the Common Life: The Community of Mirabai, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195643732}}, pages viii-x, 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The continued influence of Meera, in part, has been her message of freedom, her resolve and right to pursue her devotion to deity Krishna and her spiritual beliefs as she felt drawn to despite her persecution.&lt;ref name=dirkparita/&gt;&lt;ref name=parita/&gt; Her appeal and influence in Indian culture, writes Edwin Bryant, is from her emerging, through her legends and poems, as a person "who stands up for what is right and suffers bitterly for holding fast to her convictions, as other men and women have", yet she does so with a language of love, with words painting the "full range of emotions that mark love, whether between human beings or between human and divine".&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195148923}}, page 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Sethi has selected poems which Mira composed presumably after she came in contact with Saint [[Ravidas]].&lt;ref&gt;Sethi, V.K.,''Mira: The Divine Lover'', Radha Soami Satsang Beas, Punjab 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and Meera Pakeerah.

Some bhajans of Meera have been rendered into English by [[Robert Bly]] and [[Jane Hirshfield]] as ''Mirabai: Ecstatic Poems''.&lt;ref&gt;Bly, Robert / Hirshfield, Jane,''Mirabai: Ecstatic Poems'', Boston, Massachusetts 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Composer [[John Harbison]] adapted Bly's translations for his ''Mirabai Songs.'' There is a documentary film ''A Few Things I Know About Her'' by Anjali Panjabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-10-04/news-interviews/27307288_1_film-maker-first-film-indian-panorama-section | work=The Times of India | title=Legend of Mira Bai retold by Anjali Panjabi | date=4 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two well-known films of her life have been made in India, ''[[Meera (1945 film)|Meera]]'' (1945), a [[Tamil language]] film starring [[M. S. Subbulakshmi]], and ''[[Meera (1979 film)|Meera]]'' a 1979 [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] film by [[Gulzar (lyricist)|Gulzar]]. TV series, ''[[Meera (2009 TV series)|Meera]]'' (2009–2010) was also based on her life.

Meera Bai's life has been interpreted as a musical story in ''Meera—The Lover…'', a music album based on original compositions for some well known Meera bhajans, released 11 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vandanavishwas.com Vandana Vishwas: Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
In Rakowitz's project return he reopens his grandfather's import and export business. The company initially functioned as a drop box. In 2005 it became a packaging center and sorting facility. Members of the Iraqi diaspora community and interested citizens were invited to send things to be shipped free of charge to recipients in Iraq. Rakowitz also wanted to explore the possibility of importing things clearly labeled "Product of Iraq"; he chose dates which were legendary{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} in Iraq, with a yield of over 600 varieties. The first batch he tried to ship died in Syria but the second made its way through different nations and different customs; the dates became a representative for an Iraq refugee traveling to a new life.When they finally made it to Brooklyn there people were eager to try them, this fruit that caused so many problems to get there asked questions and brought up memories.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

One of his more notable{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} projects is Enemy Kitchen. The project began in 2004; in it Rakowitz compiles Baghdad recipes with the help of his mother and then teaches them to public audiences. The first time this project was performed was with students who lived in Chelsea and went to the Hudson Guild Community Center. With the project in cooking and eating the food, it opens up the lines of communication allowing, in this case, the students to attach the word Iraq to food as a representative of culture and discuss it. The students discussed the war and compare it to their own lives. Later this project also included a [[food truck]] that roamed around Chicago. The food truck itself gives home to the Iraqi ex-pat community and is another way of bringing art down to a level that involves and interacts with people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-09/entertainment/ct-ae-0311-michael-rakowitz-20120308_1_art-project-smart-museum-conceptual-art Michael Rakowitz interview: Enemy Kitchen food truck - tribunedigital-chicagotribune, March 9, 2012, by Christopher Borrelli]&lt;/ref&gt; Rakowitz says, "I see the truck as a potentially healing gesture, not that it has to be. I don't have delusions that it will perform the hard work of healing traumas. I do believe there can be an aesthetic of good intentions, but I'm leery of saying what those are. No, I'm not going to tell anyone it's art."{{Cite quote|date=July 2016}}

Rakowitz about how he sees his art: "As an artistic gesture I try to make an unlikely thing happen, and the impossible becomes possible. It's art because it's impossible for this to exist in the world."{{Cite quote|date=July 2016}}

{{nihongo|'''Momiji'''|紅葉}} (meaning [[Acer palmatum|Japanese maple]]) is a fictional character from the ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]'' series of video games by [[Team Ninja]] and [[Koei Tecmo]]. She is a ninja [[shrine maiden]] and an apprentice and team mate of the series' protagonist [[Ryu Hayabusa]], who was introduced as a supporting playable character in 2008's [[action game]] ''[[Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword]]''. Momiji later returned in this role in ''[[Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2]]'' (including their ''Plus'' ports for the [[PlayStation Vita]]) and ''[[Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge]]'', and is also available in ''[[Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate]]''/''[[Dead or Alive 5 Last Round|Last Round]]'' and ''[[Warriors Orochi 3]] Hyper''/''Ultimate'', as well as in ''[[Dead or Alive Xtreme 3]]''. In most of her appearances, Momiji is voiced by [[Yūko Minaguchi]] in Japanese and by [[Kate Higgins]] in English. Her character has been generally well received by the series' fans and game critics

==Appearances==
===''Ninja Gaiden''===
Momiji was raised to be Hayabusa ninja clan's Dragon Shrine Maiden like her older sister Kureha who was [[Ryu Hayabusa|Ryu]]'s childhood friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4gamer.net/games/087/G008776/20090608016/ |title=― 「NINJA GAIDEN Σ2」，公式サイトで日本語字幕付きのE3トレーラーを公開 |publisher=4gamer.net |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is both a ''shinobi'' (ninja) and a ''[[miko]]'' (shamanistic shrine maiden)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4gamer.net/games/203/G020351/20130301039/|title=― 「NINJA GAIDEN 3: Razor's Edge」，プレイアブルヒロイン「かすみ」「紅葉」の"NINJA SKILLS"などをチェック。SmartGlassを使った機能も|date=2013-04-04|publisher=4gamer.net|accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was tasked with keeping the ancient relics passed down the Hayabusa village from the ancient Dragon Lineage and carrying out the Shrine Maiden's rites and rituals to purify the world of evil forces. Among the relics that the maidens were tasked with guarding is the Eye of the Dragon, a jewel said to contain the souls of the ancient Dragons. Kureha was killed when the village was attacked in 2004's ''[[Ninja Gaiden (2004 video game)|Ninja Gaiden]]'' and the devastated Momiji began training under Ryu as a precaution, becoming a skilled [[kunoichi]] along with her shrine maiden duties and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/ninja-gaiden-sigma-2-plus-on-vita-new-screens-details-244722.phtml |title=Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus on Vita: New screens, details |publisher=Destructoid |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then she supports and follows her master whenever he comes around. Momiji is a very gentle and caring young woman who is seen  as an older sister figure by all of the village's children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teamninja-studio.com/ng3re/us/characters.htm#tab8 |title=NINJA GAIDEN 3: Razor's Edge &amp;#124; Official Site &amp;#124; TECMO KOEI America |publisher=Teamninja-studio.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the boy Sanji. Like her mentor Ryu Hayabusa, Momiji trains extensively to become one of the deadliest warriors in the Hayabusa village.

In ''[[Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword]]'', Momiji is normally playable only in the game's first chapter,&lt;ref name=ignds/&gt; but it is possible to play her through the entire game after [[Unlockable (gaming)|unlocking]] the special difficulty setting "The Way of Kunoichi",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/cheats/ng-dragon-sword |title=Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword Cheats, Hints, and Cheat Codes |publisher=Gamerevolution.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cheatcc.com/ds/ninjagaidendragonswordcheatscodes.html |title=Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword Cheats, Codes, Cheat Codes, Walkthrough, Guide, FAQ, Unlockables for Nintendo DS |publisher=Cheatcc.com |date=2014-06-13 |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which becomes accessible if the player manages to win the unfair [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight at the end Momiji's chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/ninjagaiden/ninjagaiden6.htm |title=Ninja Gaiden |publisher=Hardcoregaming101.net |date= |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her session of training with Ryu, Momiji stays behind to pick flowers for Kureha's grave where she is attacked by the Black Spider clan and eventually captured by the fiendish Red Dragon. She is interrogated by Black Spider's Obaba for the Eye of the Dragon but turns out she managed to fuse the jewel into her soul, preventing Obaba from killing her. The Fiends' leader Ishtaros plans to use the captive Momiji to lure Ryu and kill him. During the battle between Ryu and Ishtaros at the Gates of Hell, Ryu is overwhelmed by the Dark Dragonstones' power but the ghost of Kureha appears and draws out Momiji's soul. Together they release the Eye and imbue the Dragon Sword with its power, allowing it to become the True Dragon Sword that Ryu uses to defeat Ishtaros. Nicchae, the Greater Fiend of Destruction and Ishtaros's twin, appears and takes Momiji, Ishtaros' body and the eight Dark Dragonstones deeper into Hell in an attempt to reawaken the Vigoor Emperor. Nicchae's plan ends in failure as the Dark Dragon consumes the Emperor and Ishtaros before bursting forth to threaten the world once again. Ryu defeats the Dark Dragon with the True Dragon Sword, and Momiji is finally rescued. Afterwards, Momiji mourns Kureha alongside the children of the village and makes a vow at Kureha's grave to become stronger so she can defend herself and the village. She leaves Ryu a letter as she departs to train in her travels.

Momiji returns as a playable character in ''[[Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/57858/ninja-gaiden-sigma-2-trailer |title=Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Trailer: Fancy Female Ninjas - Video Game News, Videos and File Downloads for PC and Console Games at |publisher=Shacknews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ryu is away at [[Tokyo]], the Hayabusa village is invaded once again by the Black Spider clan. As Jo battles Genshin, Momji rallies the Hayabusa ninjas to protect the rest of the villagers. Ryu later returns to the village and repels the invasion, killing almost all the invading Black Spider ninjas. Momiji soon realizes that Sanji has been taken captive, prompting her to go rescue him. As she travels to Tokyo, she encounters one of the Tengu Brothers and soundly defeats him. This leads her to Sanji, who is being held prisoner by both brothers. After her victorious battle, she reassures Sanji that she will always look out for him until he becomes a master ninja. As they return home, they are unknowingly saved by Muramasa, who kills a Black Spider ninja who is about to shoot an arrow at them. Momiji is also featured in the spin-off title ''ZEN Pinball: Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/zen-pinball-ninja-gaiden-sigma-2 |title=ZEN Pinball: Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 for PlayStation 3 Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Ninja Gaiden 3]]'', after Sanji finds Ryu unconscious outside and brings him to Momiji, she watches over him and helps him recover. During his journey to find his father in the shrine, she assists him in dealing with the Grip of Murder curse while helping him defeat the Black Spider ninja clan. Whenever the curse almost takes complete control over Ryu, Momiji uses her power to protect his mind and help him regain his senses. As they get near to the shrine, they are attacked by Obaba, but they manage to defeat her. Near the end of the battle, Momiji is knocked unconscious by Obaba, but Ryu manages to save her and brings her to the shrine to be taken care of by his father. When Canna attacks Tokyo as the Goddess and Ryu begins to become overwhelmed by Fiends, Momiji and Jo arrive just in time to save him. She gives her master the Eye of the Dragon before he departs, leaving her and his father to fight off the surrounding foes.

Momiji became playable again in the ''NG3'' update ''[[Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/25673 |title=Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Ayane/Momiji Co-Op Gameplay HD Video from GameVideos |publisher=Gamevideos.1up.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711030039/http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/25673 |archivedate=2012-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She makes an appearance in the spin-off game ''[[Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4gamer.net/games/184/G018408/20140131073/ |title=「YAIBA: NINJA GAIDEN Z」，最新ムービー「OUTBREAK #5」「プレイ上のご注意」や，B級映画風ポスターなど新たなビジュアルが公開 |publisher=4Gamer.net |date=2014-03-27 |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an ally and love interest of Ryu, who is an antagonist in the game. She arrives to give the Eye of the Dragon to him, and then Ryu saves her from peril.

===Other appearances===
In the fighting games ''[[Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate]]'' and ''[[Dead or Alive 5 Last Round]]'', Momiji joins the DOA tournament in order to put what she has learned to the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teamninja-studio.com/doa5/ultimate/us/home.html#characters |title=DEAD OR ALIVE 5 Ultimate Official Site |publisher=Teamninja-studio.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is one of the nine playable female characters in the ''DOA'' sport spin-off title ''[[Dead or Alive Xtreme 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="第一回 DOAX3総選挙 〜ザック島行きチケット争奪戦〜".|url=https://www.gamecity.ne.jp/doax3/vote_result.html|website=Gamecity.ne.jp|accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=She's really [[Kawaii|cute]]. [In English] Very cute!

Kasumi and Ayane of course are beautiful girls that are done in three dimensions, right? But this new character named Momiji is done through 2D illustrations. But I think that the sense of beauty that you get from seeing her in the illustrations is equal to Kasumi.

'''Muhammad's revelation''' was an event described in [[Islam]] as taking place in 610 AD, during which the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] was visited by the archangel [[Gabriel#Islam|Jibrīl]], who revealed to him the beginnings of what would later become the [[Quran]]. The event took place in a cave called [[Hira]], located on the mountain [[Jabal al-Nour|Jabal an-Nour]], near  [[Mecca]].

According to [[Prophetic biography|biographies of Muhammad]],{{Which|date=September 2016}} while on retreat in a mountain cave near Mecca (the cave of Hira), Gabriel appears before him and commands him to recite the first lines of chapter 96 of the Quran. Muhammad's experience is mentioned in Surah 53:4–9:
:{{Cite Quran|53|4|end=9
|quote=It is no less than inspiration sent down to him:
:He was taught by one Mighty in Power,
:Endued with Wisdom: for he appeared (in stately form);
:While he was in the highest part of the horizon:
:Then he approached and came closer,
:And was at a distance of but two bow-lengths or (even) nearer;

==Before the revelation==
{{main|Muhammad}}
Muhammad was born and raised in [[Mecca]]. When he was nearly 40, he used to spend many hours alone in prayer and speculating over the aspects of creation.&lt;ref name="Shibli1"&gt;[[Shibli Nomani]]. [[Sirat-un-Nabi]]. Vol 1 [[Lahore]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}} He was concerned with the "ignorance of divine guidance" ([[Jahiliyyah]]), social unrest, injustice, widespread discrimination (particularly [[Women in Arab societies|against women]]), fighting among [[tribe]]s and abuse of tribal authorities prevalent in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Husayn Haykal|first=Muhammad|authorlink=Muhammad Husayn Haykal|title=The Life of Muhammad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOyO-TSo5nEC&amp;pg=PA79|year=2008|publisher=Islamic Book Trust|location=[[Selangor]]|isbn=978-983-9154-17-7|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moral degeneration of his fellow people, and his own quest for a true religion further lent fuel to this, with the result that he now began to withdraw periodically to a cave named [[Hira|Mount Hira]], three miles north of [[Mecca]], for contemplation and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bogle|first=Emory C.|title=Islam: Origin and Belief|year=1998|publisher=Texas University Press|location=|isbn=0-292-70862-9|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad during this period began to have dreams replete with spiritual significance which were fulfilled according to their true import; and this was the commencement of his divine revelation.&lt;ref name="Shibli1"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

==The first revelation==
[[Image:Entrance of Hira cave.jpg|thumb|The entrance to the Hira cave.]]
According to mainstream Islamic tradition, during one such occasion while he was in contemplation, the archangel [[Gabriel]] appeared before him in the year 610 AD and said, "Read", upon which he replied, "I am unable to read". Thereupon the angel caught hold of him and embraced him heavily. This happened two more times after which the angel commanded Muhammad to recite the following verses:&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami"&gt;[[Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami]] (2003), ''The History of The Qur'anic Text: From Revelation to Compilation: A Comparative Study with the Old and New Testaments'', pp. 25, 47–8. UK Islamic Academy. {{ISBN|978-1872531656}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2003), pp. 72–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sell (1913), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bukhari&gt;[http://www.sahih-bukhari.com/Pages/Bukhari_1_01.php Bukhari volume1, book 1, number 3]&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{Cite quran|96|1|end=5
|quote=Proclaim! (or read!) in the name of your Lord who created:

:Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous,–
:Who taught by the pen–
:Taught man that which he knew not.

==After the revelation==
Perplexed by this new experience, Muhammad made his way to home where he was consoled by his wife Khadijah, who also took him to her Ebionite cousin [[Waraqah ibn Nawfal]]. Waraqah was familiar with Jewish and Christian scriptures. Islamic tradition holds that Waraqah, upon hearing the description, testified to Muhammad's prophethood,&lt;ref name="Shibli1"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Sell (1913), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; and convinced Muhammad that the revelation was from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E. Campo |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam |publisher=[[Facts On File]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A1438126964&amp;pg=PA492#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8160-5454-1|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waraqah said: "O my nephew! What did you see?"  When Muhammad told him what had happened to him, Waraqah replied: "This is [[Namus]] (meaning Gabriel) that Allah sent to [[Moses in Islam|Moses]]. I wish I were younger. I wish I could live up to the time when your people would turn you out." Muhammad asked: "Will they drive me out?" Waraqah answered in the affirmative and said: "Anyone who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should be alive until that day, then I would support you strongly." A few days later Waraqah died.&lt;ref name=tabari/&gt;

The initial revelation was followed by a pause and a second encounter with Gabriel when Muhammad heard a voice from the sky and saw the same angel "sitting between the sky and the earth" and the revelations resumed with the first verses of chapter 74.

[[At-Tabari]] and [[Ibn Hisham]] reported that Muhammad left the cave of Hira after being surprised by the revelation, but later on, returned to the cave and continued his solitude, though subsequently he returned to [[Mecca]]. Tabari and Ibn Ishaq write that Muhammad told Zubayr:&lt;ref name=tabari/&gt;

:"when I was midway on the mountain, I heard a voice from heaven saying "O Muhammad! you are the apostle of Allah and I am Gabriel." I raised my head towards heaven to see who was speaking, and Gabriel in the form of a man with feet astride the horizon, saying, "O Muhammad! you are the apostle of Allah and I am Gabriel." I stood gazing at him moving neither forward nor backward, then I began to turn my face away from him, but towards whatever region of the sky I looked, I saw him as before."

There is doubt about the period of time between Muhammad's first and second experiences of revelation. Ibn Ishaq writes that three years elapsed from the time that Muhammad received the first revelation until he started to preach publicly. Bukhari takes chapter 74 as the second revelation however chapter 68 has strong claims to be the second revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=Clinton|title=In Search of Muhammad|year=1998|publisher=Cassell|isbn=0826435769|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First wahy in Sunnah==
[[Ḥadīth]] (حديث) is literally "speech"; recorded saying or tradition of [[Muhammad]] validated by [[isnad]]; with [[Sirah Rasul Allah]] these comprise the [[sunnah]] and reveal [[shariah]]. According to [[Aishah]],&lt;ref&gt;Grade: Sahih (Al-Albani)	  صحيح   (الألباني)	حكم :

The event of first revelation of Mohammed is recorded in hadith via his wife [[Aisha]]
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Messenger was in the form of good dreams which came true like bright daylight, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food likewise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet replied, "I do not know how to read." The Prophet added, "The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists), created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous." (96.1, 96.2, 96.3)&lt;ref&gt;http://al-quran.info/#96:3&lt;/ref&gt; Then Allah's Messenger returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, "Cover me! Cover me!" They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had happened and said, "I fear that something may happen to me." Khadija replied, "Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones." Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa ibn Naufal bin Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, "Listen to the story of your nephew, O my cousin!" Waraqa asked, "O my nephew! What have you seen?" Allah's Messenger described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, "This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out." Allah's Messenger asked, "Will they drive me out?" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said, "Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly." But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also, paused for a while.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih al-Bukhari]] 3

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here is the quotation from [[Ibn Ishaq]] on [[Muhammad]]'s first meeting with [[Gabriel]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When it was the night on which God honored him with his mission and showed mercy on His servants thereby, Gabriel brought him the command of God. "He came to me," said the apostle of God, "while I was asleep, with a coverlet of brocade whereon was some writing, and said, ‘Read!’ I said, ‘What shall I read?’ He pressed me with it so tightly that I thought it was death; then he let me go and said, ‘Read!’ I said, ‘What shall I read?’ He pressed me with it again so that I thought it was death; then he let me go and said ‘Read!’ I said, ‘What shall I read?’ He pressed me with it the third time so that I thought it was death and said ‘Read!’ I said, ‘What then shall I read?’—and this I said only to deliver myself from him, lest he should do the same to me again. He said:

:‘Read in the name of thy Lord who created, Who created man of blood coagulated. Read! Thy Lord is the most beneficent, Who taught by the pen, Taught that which they knew not unto men.’

So I read it, and he departed from me. And I awoke from my sleep, and it was as though these words were written on my heart.

Now none of God’s creatures was more hateful to me than an (ecstatic) poet or a man possessed: I could not even look at them. I thought, Woe is me poet or possessed—Never shall Quraysh say this of me! I will go to the top of the mountain and throw myself down that I may kill myself and gain rest. So I went forth to do so and then when I was midway on the mountain, I heard a voice from heaven saying, “O Muhammad! thou art the apostle of God and I am Gabriel.” "([[Ibn Ishaq]], ''[[Sirat Rasul Allah]]'', p. 106)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35226">[[New religious movement]]s and [[cult]]s have appeared as themes or subjects in [[literature]] and [[popular culture]], while notable representatives of such groups have themselves produced a large body of literary works.  Beginning in the 1700s authors in the English-speaking world began introducing members of "cults" as [[antagonists]].&lt;ref name = "brubaker"/&gt;  [[Satanists]], sects of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], and [[Thuggees]] were popular choices.  In the twentieth century concern for the rights and feelings of [[Religious minority|religious minorities]] led authors to invent fictional cults for their [[villain]]s to belong to.&lt;ref name = "brubaker"&gt;

| quote =As a plot device the idea of the cult is centuries old.  What constitutes a “cult,” however, has turned out to be variable.  Seen from one perspective, most religions and faith groups can be defined as cults.  Traditionally --  though not today – a “cult” has been defined as a non-Judeo-Christian religious group, with the word “cult” being used in a pejorative way.  That this is insulting to worshipers of those groups has not been acknowledged; the producers of popular culture were usually marketing their work to a select group, usually white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, which did not include members of the “cult” groups.  Modern authors tend to be more sensitive toward members of the “cult” groups and usually (though not always) create fictional cults for antagonists to be members of.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Fictional cults continue to be popular in film, television, and gaming in the same way.

== Background ==

A [[new religious movement]] (NRM) is a [[religious]] community or ethical, spiritual, or philosophical group of modern origins, which has a peripheral place within its nation's dominant religious culture. NRMs may be novel in origin or they may be part of a wider religion, in which case they will be distinct from pre-existing [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s.&lt;ref&gt;T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. "Unit 13: Social Psychology." pp 320 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/TLBrink_PSYCH13.pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars continue to try to reach definitions and define boundaries.&lt;ref name="cesnur"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cesnur.org/2001/mi_june03.htm |title=The Future of Religion and the Future of New Religions |accessdate=2006-12-13 |author=Introvigne, Massimo |date=June 15, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A NRM may be one of a wide range of movements ranging from those with loose affiliations based on novel approaches to [[spirituality]] or [[religion]] to [[communitarian]] enterprises that demand a considerable amount of group conformity and a social identity that [[separatism|separates]] their adherents from [[mainstream]] society.&lt;ref&gt;Coney, J. (1998) “A response to Religious Liberty in Western Europe by Massimo Introvigne” ISKON Communications Journal, 5(2)&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars have estimated that NRM's now number in the tens of thousands worldwide, with most in Asia and Africa.  Most have only a few members, some have thousands, and only very few have more than a million.&lt;ref name = barker1999&gt;[[Eileen Barker]], 1999, "New Religious Movements: their incidence and significance", ''New Religious Movements: challenge and response'', Bryan Wilson and Jamie Cresswell editors, [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|0415200504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==

=== Early twentieth century ===

[[Zane Grey]], in his ''[[Riders of the Purple Sage]]'' (1912), a [[Western (genre)|Western]] novel that would have a major influence on [[Hollywood]], lambasts the [[Mormons]] and has his gunslinger hero rescue a wealthy young woman in the early 1870s from the clutches of elderly [[polygamists]] via exceedingly bloody gunfights. The novel contains a portrayal of the psychological conflicts of the young woman, raised a Mormon but gradually coming to the realization that she wants a supposedly less constricted life. (The Mormon misdeeds depicted in the story take place on the southern frontier of [[Utah]], and Grey makes no suggestion of the involvement of Mormon [[leader]]s in [[Salt Lake City]].) The harassment of the young woman reflects a popular literary theme in [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s England.

In [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s ''[[The Dain Curse]]'' (1929), much of the mystery puzzle revolves around the Temple of the Holy Grail, a fictitious California circle that Hammett's characters repeatedly describe as a "cult". Hammett depicts it as starting as a scam, although the putative leader begins to believe in his own fraudulent claims.

[[A.E.W. Mason]], in ''[[The Prisoner in the Opal]]'' (1928), one of his [[Inspector Hanaud]] mysteries, describes the unmasking of a [[Satanist]] cult.

The Italian novelist [[Sibilla Aleramo]], in ''Amo, dunque sono'' (I Love, Therefore, I Am) (1927) depicted [[Julius Evola]]'s [[UR Group]], a hermetical circle and intellectual movement — strongly influenced by [[Anthroposophy]] — that attempted to provide a spiritual direction to [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian fascism|fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;
[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]. ''[[Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity]]''. New York University Press, 2002.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Aleramo described the character based on her former lover Evola as "inhuman, an icy architect of acrobatic theories, vain, vicious, perverse." Aleramo based her hero on Giulio Parise, who would unsuccessfully attempt to oust the pro-Fascist Evola as the circle's leader in 1928, resulting in an announcement by Evola that he would thenceforth exert "an absolute unity of direction" over the circle's publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{ill|Renato Del Ponte|it}}, "Julius Evola and the UR Group," preface to ''Introduction to Magic: Rituals and Practical Techniques for the Magus'' (anthology of writings by Evola and his associates), trans. Guido Stucco, ed. [[Michael Jenkins Moynihan]], [[Inner Traditions]]: Rochester, Vermont, 2001.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid and late twentieth century===
Science-fiction writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]] wrote two novels that deal with fictional cult-like groups. A leading figure in his early "[[Future History (novel)|Future History]]" series (see ''[[If This Goes On|If This Goes On--]]'', a short novel published in ''Revolt in 2100''), Nehemiah Scudder, a religious "prophet", becomes dictator of the [[United States of America|United States]]. By his own admission in an afterword, Heinlein poured into this book his distrust of all forms of religious fundamentalism, the [[Ku Klux Klan]], the [[Communist Party]] and other movements that he regarded as [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]]. Heinlein also stated in the afterword that he had worked out the plot of other books about Scudder, but had decided not to write them — in part because he found Scudder so unpleasant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert A. |last=Heinlein |chapter=Concerning Stories Never Written: Postscript  |title=Revolt in 2100 |location=Chicago |publisher=Shasta |year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heinlein's  novel ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' features two cults: the "Dionysian Church of the New Revelation, Fosterite", and the protagonist Valentine Michael Smith's own "Church of All Worlds". Heinlein treats of the motives and methods of religious leaders in some detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert A. |last=Heinlein |title=Stranger in a Strange Land |location=New York |publisher=Putnam |year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictional cults also feature in science fantasy and in horror novels. In ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', [[C.S. Lewis]] describes the National Institute for Co-ordinated Experiments, or "NICE", a quasi-governmental front concealing a kind of [[doomsday cult]] that worships a disembodied head kept alive by scientific means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=C.S. |last=Lewis |title=That Hideous Strength |location=London |publisher=The Bodley Head |year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis' novel is notable for its elaboration of his 1944 address "The Inner Ring." The latter work criticizes the lust to "belong" to a powerful clique — a common human failing that Lewis believed was the basis for people being seduced into power-hungry and spiritually twisted movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Inner Ring |first=C.S. |last=Lewis |title=The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses |location=San Francisco |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |year=2001 |origyear=1949 |isbn=0-06-065320-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joseph |last=Loconte |title=What Would C.S.

In [[William Campbell Gault]]'s ''Sweet Wild Wench'', L.A. private eye Joe Puma investigates the "Children of Proton", a fictional cult that has attracted the support of the daughter of a wealthy businessman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William Campbell |last=Gault |title=Sweet Wild Wench |location=Greenwich, Connecticut |publisher=Fawcett |year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-first century===
Popular French author [[Michel Houellebecq]]'s 2005 science-fiction novel, ''[[The Possibility of an Island]]'', describes a [[cloning]] group that resembles the [[Raëlism|Raëlians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Le Nouvel Observateur]] |date=2005-10-19 |url=http://permanent.nouvelobs.com/people/20051012.OBS1891.html |title=Houellebecq, prêtre honoraire du mouvement raëlien |accessdate=2009-08-03 |language=French |trans-title=Houellebecq, honorary priest of the Raëlien movement}} "Le roman de Michel Houellebecq, sorti le 31 août, met en scène une secte triomphante, qui resemble fort à celle des raëliens, alors que l'auteur prédit la mort des grandes religions monothéistes. Il a choisi la secte des raëliens parce qu'"elle est adaptée aux temps modernes, à la civilisation des loisirs, elle n'impose aucune contrainte morale et, surtout, elle promet l'immortalité." [TRANSLATION: "Michel Houellebecq's novel, appearing on 31 August, depicts a victorious cult, strongly resembling that of the Raëlians, while the author predicts the  death of the great monotheist religions. He chose the Raëlian cult because "it has adapted to modern times, to the leisure civilization. it imposes no moral constraint and, above all, it promises immortality."]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Muchamore]] has written a book for teenagers, ''[[Divine Madness (novel)|Divine Madness]]'', about a religious cult that has a vast number of members: the main characters of the book must infiltrate the cult to discover a sinister plot.

The novel ''[[Godless (novel)|Godless]]'' centers around a teenager who forms a religious cult that worships his hometown's water tower.

=== Literary works by founders of new trends or movements ===

[[Aleister Crowley]], founder of the English-speaking branch of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] and of a short-lived commune (the "[[Abbey of Thelema]]") in Sicily, wrote poetry (anthologized in 1917 in ''The Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse'') and novels (''[[Diary of a Drug Fiend]]'' (1922) and ''[[Moonchild (novel)|Moonchild]]'' (1929)). Crowley died in 1947. His autobiography, ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'', republished in 1969, attracted much attention. ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'' describes Crowley's fiction and his manuals on the occult as examples of "lifestyle fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;See "Crowley, Aleister" entry in John Clute and John Grant, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The travel-writer, poet and painter [[Nicholas Roerich]], the founder of [[Agni Yoga]], expressed his [[spirituality|spiritual]] beliefs through his depiction of the stark mountains of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich.org/nr.html?mid=wrtgs |title=Nicholas Roerich Museum |accessdate=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His classic travel-books include ''Heart of Asia: Memoirs from the Himalayas'' (1929) and ''Shambhala: In Search of the New Era'' (1930).

[[L. Ron Hubbard]], the founder of [[Scientology]], worked as a contributing author in the [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]] (1930s to 1950s) and in the horror and fantasy genres. In a bibliographical study of his works, Marco Frenschkowski agrees with [[Stephen King]] in regarding ''[[Fear (Hubbard novella)|Fear]]'' (1940) as one of the major horror tales of the 20th century, and praises "its imaginative use of the prosaic and its demythologizing of traditional weird fiction themes". Other works which Frenschkowski cites as notable include ''Typewriter in the Sky'' (1940), ''To the Stars'' (1950), the best-selling ''Battlefield Earth'' (1982), and the ten-volume ''[[Mission Earth (novel)|Mission Earth]]'' (1985–1987). Frenschkowski concludes that although Hubbard's fiction has received excessive praise from his followers, science-fiction critics leery of Scientology have  underrated it.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Frenschkowski, [http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/mjr/frenschkowski.html "L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology"] (annotated bibliographical survey), ''Marburg Journal of Religion'', 4:1, July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; John Clute and Peter Nichols, however, manage to praise much of Hubbard's oeuvre while also raising questions about the thematic link to Scientology. Hubbard's "canny utilization of superman protagonists" in his early work, they argue, came to "tantalize" s-f writers and fans "with visions of transcendental power" and may explain why so many early followers of Hubbard's movement came from the s-f community.&lt;ref&gt;"L. Ron Hubbard" entry in John Clute and Peter Nichols, ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', second ed., New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1993. {{ISBN|0-312-09618-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G.I. Gurdjieff]], the Greek-Armenian mystic and spiritual teacher who introduced and taught the [[Fourth Way]], authored three literary works that comprise his ''[[All and Everything]]'' trilogy. The best known, ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men]]'', a memoir of Gurdjieff's youthful search for spiritual truth, has become a minor classic. [[Peter Brook]] made it into a film (1979). The trilogy also includes ''[[Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson]]'', a curious melange of philosophy, humor and science-fiction that some regard as a masterpiece. [[P.L. Travers]], author of the [[Mary Poppins]] series and a disciple of Gurdjieff, described ''Beelzebub'' as "soaring off into space, like a great, lumbering flying cathedral".&lt;ref&gt;"Gurdjieff," in ''Man, Myth and Magic: Encyclopedia of the Supernatural'', London: Purnell, 1970-71 ([http://www.gurdjieff.org/travers1.htm gurdjieff.org])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Seymour-Smith]] included ''Beelzebub'' in his ''[[100 Most Influential Books Ever Written]]'', characterising it as "...the most convincing fusion of Eastern and Western thought that has yet been seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Martin Seymour-Smith|Seymour-Smith, Martin]] |title=The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written: The History of Thought from Ancient Times to Today |isbn=0-8065-2192-9 |pages=447–452 |year=2001 |publisher =C Trade Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurdjieff's final volume, ''[[Life is Real Only Then, When 'I Am']]'', consists of an incomplete text published posthumously.

[[Eli Siegel]], the founder of [[Aesthetic Realism]], wrote highly regarded poetry. [[William Carlos Williams]] described his "Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana" (1925)&lt;ref&gt;[http://aestheticrealism.net/poetry/HotAfternoons.htm HotAfternoons] (Republished in Siegel's 1957 book of the same name: Siegel, Eli. ''Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana'', New York: Definitions Press, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; as his "major poem", and wrote that Siegel "belongs in the first ranks of our living artists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aestheticrealism.net/poetry/WilliamsLetter1951.htm William Carlos Williams, "Letter to Martha Baird," in Breslin, J.E.B., ed., ''Something to Say'', New York: New Directions, 1985 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics and poets who praised Siegel's work included Selden Rodman&lt;ref&gt;Selden Rodman, Review of "Hot Afternoons," ''Saturday Review'', 17 August 1957&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kenneth Rexroth]]; the latter wrote that "it's about time Eli Siegel was moved up into the ranks of our acknowledged Leading Poets."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/essays/siegel.htm Rexroth, ''New York Times Book Review'', March 23, 1969]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Important non-fiction writers among founders of movements===

[[Helena Blavatsky]], the Russian [[adventure]]ss who founded [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], wrote ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' (1887) and ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888), and had an immense cultural and intellectual influence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, helping to stimulate the [[Indian nationalist movement]], [[parapsychology]], the fantasy literary genre,&lt;ref&gt;
See "Blavatsky, Helena" and "Theosophy" entries in John Clute and John Grant, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1997
&lt;/ref&gt;
and the [[New Age]] movement. ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'' describes her two major books as "enormous, entrancing honeypots of myth, fairytale, speculation, fabrication and tomfoolery".&lt;ref&gt;
"Theosophy" in John Clute and John Grant, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1997
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861–1925), the founder of [[Anthroposophy]], wrote in a variety of fields (his collected works total 350 volumes) and influenced such figures as the novelist [[Herman Hesse]] and the philosopher [[Owen Barfield]]. Through his writings and lectures, Steiner stimulated the development of the [[cooperative movement]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} [[alternative medicine]], [[organic farming]], the [[Waldorf schools]], and "[[eurythmy]]" in modern dance.

* ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' has a cult called the "Mythic Dawn". The player must join the cult in an effort to defeat it.
* In [[Devil May Cry 4]], there is a quasi-religious group called the Order of the Sword that worships the demon Sparda and has many cult-like tendencies.
* In ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'', [[Leon Kennedy]] fights against a cult of Spanish villagers possessed by parasites.
* In ''[[Diablo II]]'', the player is tasked to fight against a variety of religious cults: There are shamanic groups who gather around "healers" and whose adherents are called "the fallen". Their spiritual guru is one "Colenzo". Then there is a monastery that has turned to a form of satanic death-worship, and an old initiative order called the "Order of the Horadrim" whose leadership has gone mad. In the third act of the game, a cult named the "Zakarum" with priests of the ranks of "sextons", "cantors", and "hierophants", is depicted. The cult followers are called the "faithful" or "zealots", and there is also a "High Council".
* In ''[[Diablo III]]'', a large cult known as the ''Dark Coven'' plays an important role of Act 1 and 25% of Act 2. Players are tasked with putting them to justice when Maghda, the cult's mistress, murders Deckard Cain.
* In ''[[EarthBound]]'', Ness must rescue a girl with psychic powers named Paula from a cult called Happy Happyism that resembles the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[Aum Shinrikyo]] and believes that everything must be painted blue. The Happy Happyists are controlling a small town named Happy Happy Village. Their leader is named [[Mr. Carpainter]], and a statue called the Mani Mani Statue is controlling the cult's thoughts. Eventually, Ness breaks the spell over the cultists and rescues Paula. Many of the characteristics of the cult are similar to real-world cults: Mr. Carpainter is claimed to have received a "divine revelation" that told him to create the cult, otherwise normal citizens appear to have delusions, and a woman in the town asks for donations.
* In the [[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]] series, the majority of the crew of the Ishimura are "Unitologists" and are seen as cultists, Other sequels have Unitology plays a bigger main role.
* In ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'', the player may either side with or defy the Cult of Andraste before obtaining Her Sacred Ashes from the Urn.
* In ''[[Fallout 3]]'', ''[[Fallout 4]]'' and it's add-on ''[[Fallout 4: Far Harbor|Far Habor]]''. There is a cult named The Children Of The Atom (named for the [[Children of the Atom|novel]]), who worship an undetonated nuclear bomb in a settlement called Megaton. Later they appear various parts in New England including furthest in [[Mount Desert Island]], Maine that they formed several holy sites and including one is inside a Nuclear Submarine base.
* In ''[[Fallout 2]]'' and ''Fallout 4'' add-on ''[[Nuka World]]'', there is a cult named The Hubologists, a thinly veiled reference to [[L. Ron Hubbard]]. The practices of the cult broadly resemble some of the practices of [[Scientology]].
* In [[Grand Theft Auto]] games there is a frequent discussion on the radio, and by pedestrians about the Epsilon Program, a religion started by the character Chris Formage, which has been called "a cult" by GTA radio personalities such as [[Lazlow Jones]]. Protagonist Michael De Santa can join the Epsilon Program who sometimes calling themselves Epsilonists in ''[[Grand Theft Auto 5]]'', the religion in general as of GTA 5 is mostly based in Scientology and [[Raelism]] when come off their uniforms and some of their theology. Trevor Phillips can deliver people to another cult in the game known as The Altruist Cult, who are implied to be mainly Egotistic Misanthropic [[Baby Boomers|Baby Booming]] cannibals who believes younger generations are creating world problems, and Franklin Clinton will be contacted by a therapy-like cult called The Children of the Mountain where he can participate in a survey and earn a Children of the Mountain T-shirt.
* In the [[Warcraft Universe|''Warcraft'' Universe]] a number of cults exist, some worshiping ancient evils; seeking to bring them back into the world like the Twilight's Hammer, while others like the "Cult of the Damned" seek to end all life on Azeroth, while securing their own immortality in [[undeath]].
* The game ''[[Persona 3]]'', the human villains are the founders and leaders of a cult worshiping Nyx: the harbinger of the [[apocalypse]].
* In the "[[Fatal Frame]]" series there are a variety of cults that perform [[rituals]] and [[sacrifices]].
* The game ''[[Far Cry 5]]'' features a [[doomsday cult]] called the Project at Eden's Gate that took over a fictional county in Montana as the main plot. The Cult took inspirations from majority [[Branch Davidians]], icon of the cult was represented [[Scientology]] and take over the county is a nod to [[Rajneesh movement]].

'''''Pentacle''''' is a [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] magazine that began publication in February 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pentacle (Magazine)|url=https://www.morebooks.de/store/gb/book/pentacle-magazine/isbn/978-613-8-59105-4|publisher=More Books|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by Marion Pearce and Jon Randall. It is a quarterly magazine published on the dates of the old festivals of [[Imbolc]], [[Beltaine]], [[Lammas]] and [[Samhain]], and has a worldwide distribution of 2,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rate and Data |journal=Pentacle|publisher=Marion|author=Jon Randall|volume=1|issue=21|page=4|date=1 May 2007|issn=1753-898X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was conceived to provide an independent voice for today's [[Paganism|Pagan]], those not wanting to be told what to believe by the two main organisation-backed pagan magazines{{specify}} of the time.

''Pentacle'' has published articles on [[folklore]], [[ritual]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[archaeology]]. Articles have covered many aspects of pagan traditions, including {{linktext|heathen}}, [[Druidry]], and other classical and modern traditions. The magazine has also included announcements of workshops, conferences, [[Folkmoot|moots]], festivals, activities, training, groups and exchange magazines. Most of the articles have been once again aimed at the beginner/intermediate level reader, often written by the Pagan community and readership, whose members cover many levels of expertise. Furthermore it has contained a large amount of pagan and [[visionary art]] throughout, supporting all levels and abilities.

==History==
Marion Pearce, the first editor (now the publisher) has included art, [[animal welfare]] and [[poetry]]. She has also included many articles on [[archaeology]] and historical folk practices. She stood down as editor in 2006 to allow the magazine to grow internationally.

The subsequent editor, Jon Randall, further expanded the remit of the magazine to include [[herbalism]], [[counseling]] and science-backed therapies. This was achieved through a more rigorous academic methodology, contrasted by a more hands-on approach to [[Paganism]] as a religion and life choice. His style was more hard-hitting than the previous editor, and he tended to "call it as he saw it", leading to the inclusion of more in-depth articles that challenged and stretched the readership.

As of January 2010, Jon Randall resigned from his position as Designer and Editor.

In the meantime, Marion Pearce took over the reins again as editor.  There has been a new forum and Facebook page, where readers can contribute ideas for the kind of content they would like to see included.  The relaunched magazine has been described there in the following manner:

: ''Back will be the informative articles, with wide ranging pagan and archaeological news, poetry, and classified sections, all illustrated in full colour by high class art work. Back too will be a regular environmental feature.  There will also be a new regular feature on sacred sites throughout the UK.  All you need to know about the pagan community in the UK - in one magazine.''

''Pentacle'' has supported the [[PaganDASH]] initiative to have Paganism counted in the UK [[Census]] 2011.

'''Radical 113''' ({{script|Hant|示}} [[Unicode]] U+793A, compound form {{script|Hant|礻}} at U+793B, [[pinyin]] ''{{lang|pny|shì}}'' meaning '''"[[Veneration of the dead|ancestor, veneration]]"''') is number 113 out of  214 [[List of Kangxi radicals|Kangxi radicals]]. It is one of 23 radicals composed of five strokes (the compound form has four strokes). In the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] there are 213 characters (out of 49,030) to be found under this [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]].

The character {{script|Hant|[[:wikt:示|示]]}} represents an altar or offering table, the top stroke depicting the offered goods. Compare to this the Egyptian ''[[Hotep|ḥtp]]'' hieroglyph &lt;!--&lt;hiero&gt;R4&lt;/hiero&gt;--&gt; which has the same motivation of "altar with offering". In the [[seal script]] the table has a {{lang|la|T}} shape.
Semantically, the sign suggests relation to anything connected with animism in [[Chinese folk religion|traditional Chinese religion]], such as [[:wikt:祭|祭]]   "to sacrifice, to practice ancestor veneration", ultimately composed of the sign for meat [[:wikt:肉|肉]] and the sign for a hand [[:wikt:手|手]] above the altar character, as it were iconographically expressing "hand placing  meat on an altar". The sign [[:wikt:祟|祟]] for "spirit" originally referred to misfortune caused by malevolent spirits. 
In [[:wikt:禁|禁]] (''jīn '') "to forbid, restrict, restrain", the [[:wikt:林|林]] (''lín '') above the radical has only phonetic significance ([[rebus writing]]).
Similarly, [[:wikt:神|神]] "spirit" has radical 113 plus [[Radical 102|申]] ''shēn'' as a phonetic marker.
[[:wikt:祖|祖]] "ancestor" on the other hand has radical 113 plus [[:wikt:且|且]], a pictograph of a stand with shelves for offerings to ancestors.

Some signs including the radical have no connection with spirits or animism and are placed in the category purely on formal grounds, such as 票 "ticket" which originally had radical {{script|Hant|[[Radical 86|火]]}} rather than {{script|Hant|示}}.

The compound form {{script|Hant|礻}} always appears in the left half of characters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34296">Scholarly studies have investigated the effects of religion on health. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) discerns four dimensions of health, namely physical, social, mental, and spirirtual health. Having a [[religious belief]] may have both positive and negative impacts on health and morbidity.

==Religion and spirituality==
[[Spirituality]] has been ascribed many different definitions in different contexts, but a general definition is: an individual’s search for meaning and purpose in life. Spirituality is distinct from [[organized religion]] in that spirituality does not necessarily need a religious framework. That is, one does not necessarily need to follow certain rules, guidelines or practices to be spiritual, but an organized religion often has some combination of these in place. Some people who suffer from severe mental disorders may find comfort in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pargament|first=Kenneth|date=February 2013|title=Understanding and addressing religion among people with mental illness|journal=World Psychiatry|volume=12 | issue = 1 |pages=26–32|doi=10.1002/wps.20005|pmid=23471791|pmc=3619169}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who report themselves to be spiritual people may not observe any specific religious practices or traditions.&lt;ref name="Nelson, C.J. 2002 pp. 213"&gt;Nelson, C.J., Rosenfeld, B., Breitbart, W., Galietta, M. (2002). Spirituality, religion, and depression in the terminally ill 43. Psychosomatics. pp. 213–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific research==
More than 3000 empirical studies have examined relationships between '''religion and health''', including more than 1200 in the 20th century,&lt;ref name=khandbook2001&gt;{{cite book |last1=Koenig |authorlink1=Harold G.

==Dimensions of health==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) discerns four dimensions of health, namely physical, social, mental, and spirirtual health.

===Physical health===

====Positive effects====
According to Ellison &amp; Levin (1998), some studies indicate that religiosity appears to positively correlate with physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

These are based on the experience of religion is positive in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seybold,K.S &amp; Hill,P.C|date=February 2001|title=The Role Of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=10 | issue = 1 |pages=21–24|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00106|jstor=20182684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One possibility is that religion provides physical health benefits indirectly. Church attendees present with lower rates of alcohol consumption and improvement in mood, which is associated with better physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Similar studies have been done investigating religious emotions and health. Although religious emotions, such as humility, forgiveness, and gratitude confer health benefits, it is unclear if religious people cultivate and experience those emotions more frequently than non-religious peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

====Church attendance====
Church attendance has been found to increase life expectancy (Hummer et al. 1999) with a life expectancy at age 20 of 83 years for frequent attendees and 75 years for non-attendees.  The finding, however, does not prove that religion in itself increases life expectancy.

====Death rates====
Kark et. (1996) included almost 4,000 Israelis, over 16 years (beginning in 1970), death rates were compared between the experimental group (people belonging to 11 religious [[kibbutz]]im) versus the control group (people belonging to secular kibbutzim). Some determining factors for the groups included the date the kibbutz was created, geography of the different groups, and the similarity in age. It was determined that “belonging to a religious collective was associated with a strong protective effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kark JD, Shemi G, Friedlander Y, Martin O, Manor O, Blondheim SH |title=Does religious observance promote health? mortality in secular vs religious kibbutzim in Israel |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=341–6 |date=March 1996  |pmid=8604758 |pmc=1380514 |doi=10.2105/ajph.86.3.341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do religious people tend to exhibit healthier lifestyles, they also have a strong support system that secular people would not normally have. A religious community can provide support especially through a stressful life event such as the death of a loved one or illness. There is the belief that a higher power will provide healing and strength through the rough times which also can explain the lower mortality rate of religious people vs. secular people.

The existence of ‘religious struggle’ in elderly patients was predictive of greater risk of mortality in a study by Pargament et al. (2001). Results indicate that patients, with a previously sound religious life, experienced a 19% to 28% greater mortality due to the belief that God was supposedly punishing them or abandoning them.

====Infections====
A number of religious practices have been reported to cause [[infections]]. These happened during an ultra-orthodox Jewish [[circumcision]]s practice known as [[Brit milah#Metzitzah B.27Peh|metzitzah b'peh]], the ritual 'side roll' in [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The ‘side roll’ is a ritual performed during a Hindu festival in which large numbers of male devotees lie prostrate on the ground and roll sideways around the temple premises in fulfilment of vows taken at the temple. Because the men’s upper bodies are usually bare during this ritual, their skin comes into contact with the parasitic larvae that infest the soil or sand on the ground, resulting in the [[Cutaneous larva migrans]] (CLM) skin disease.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Communion rite|communion]] [[chalice]], during the Islamic [[Hajj]] and after the Muslim ritual [[Ablution in Islam|ablution]].&lt;ref name="Pellerin"&gt;{{Cite journal

====Prayer====
{{Main|Studies on intercessory prayer}}

Some religions claim that praying for somebody who is sick can have positive effects on the health of the person being prayed for. [[meta-study|Meta-studies]] of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is "no discernible effect" while a 2007 systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had "small, but significant, effect sizes" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref name=Masters &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masters | first1 = K. | last2 = Spielmans | first2 = G. | last3 = Goodson | first3 = J. | date = Aug 2006 | title = Are there demonstrable effects of distant intercessory prayer?

Randomized controlled trials of intercessory prayer have not yielded significant effects on health. These trials have compared personal, focused, committed and organized intercessory prayer with those interceding holding some belief that they are praying to God or a god versus any other intervention. A Cochrane collaboration review of these trials concluded that 1) results were equivocal, 2) evidence does not support a recommendation either in favor or against the use of intercessory prayer and 3) any resources available for future trials should be used to investigate other questions in health research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roberts L, Ahmed I, Hall S, Davison A |title=Intercessory prayer for the alleviation of ill health |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD000368 |year=2009 |pmid=19370557 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000368.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a case-control study done following 5,286 Californians over a 28-year period in which variables were controlled for (i.e. age, race/ethnicity, gender, education level), participants who went to church on a frequent basis (defined as attending a religious service once a week or more) were 36% less likely to die during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Strawbridge WJ, Cohen RD, Shema SJ, Kaplan GA |title=Frequent attendance at religious services and mortality over 28 years |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=957–61 |date=June 1997  |pmid=9224176 |pmc=1380930 |doi=10.2105/ajph.87.6.957}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can be partly be attributed to a better lifestyle since religious people tend to drink and smoke less and eat a healthier diet.

===Mental health===
Evidence suggests that religiosity can be a pathway to both mental health and mental disorder. For example, [[religiosity]] is positively associated with mental disorders that involve an excessive amount of self-control and negatively associated with mental disorders that involve a lack of self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Depression====
Studies have shown a negative relationship between spiritual well-being and depressive symptoms. In one study, those who were assessed to have a higher spiritual [[quality of life]] on a spiritual well-being scale had less [[Depression symptoms|depressive symptoms]].&lt;ref&gt;Fehring, R.J., Miller, J.F., Shaw, C. (1997). Spiritual well-being, religiosity, hope, depression, and other mood states in elderly people coping with cancer 24. Oncology Nursing Forum. pp. 663–671.&lt;/ref&gt; Cancer and AIDS patients who were more spiritual had lower depressive symptoms than religious patients. Spirituality shows beneficial effects possibly because it speaks to one’s ability to intrinsically find meaning in life, strength, and inner peace, which is especially important for very ill patients.&lt;ref name="Nelson, C.J. 2002 pp. 213"/&gt;

Exline et al. 1999  showed that the difficulty in forgiving God and alienation from God were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Among those who currently believed in God, forgiving God for a specific, unfortunate incident predicted lower levels of anxious and depressed mood.

====Schizophrenia and Psychosis====
Studies have reported beneficial effects of spirituality on the lives of patients with schizophrenia, [[major depression]], and other psychotic disorders. Schizophrenic patients were less likely to be re-hospitalized if families encouraged [[religious]] practice, and in depressed patients who underwent religiously based interventions, their symptoms improved faster than those who underwent [[secular]] interventions. Furthermore, a few cross-sectional studies have shown that more religiously involved people had less instance of [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Koenig, H. G. (2008) Research on religion, spirituality, and mental health: A review. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Life satisfaction====
Research shows that religiosity moderates the relationship between “thinking about meaning of life” and life satisfaction. For individuals scoring low and moderately on religiosity, thinking about the meaning of life is negatively correlated with life satisfaction. For people scoring highly on religiosity, however, this relationship is positive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Religiosity has also been found to moderate the relationship between negative affect and life satisfaction, such that life satisfaction is less strongly influenced by the frequency of negative emotions in more religious (vs less religious) individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joshanloo|first=Mohsen|date=2016-04-01|title=Religiosity moderates the relationship between negative affect and life satisfaction: A study in 29 European countries|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656616300010|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=61|pages=11–14|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2016.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coping with trauma====
{{Main|Religion and coping with trauma}}

One of the most common ways that people cope with trauma is through the comfort found in religious or spiritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Pargament, K. I. (1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists of religion have performed multiple studies to measure the positive and negative effects of this coping style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trevino | first1 = K. M. | last2 = Pargament | first2 = K. I. | year = 2007 | title = Religious coping with terrorism and natural disaster | url = | journal = Southern Medical Journal | volume = 100 | issue = 9| pages = 946–947 | doi=10.1097/smj.0b013e3181454660| pmid = 17902314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading researchers have split religious coping into two categories: positive religious coping and negative religious coping. Individuals who use positive religious coping are likely to seek spiritual support and look for meaning in a traumatic situation. Negative religious coping (or [[spiritual struggle]]s) expresses conflict, question, and doubt regarding issues of God and faith.

The effects of religious coping are measured in many different circumstances, each with different outcomes. Some common experiences where people use religious coping are fear-inflicting events such as 9/11 or the holocaust, death and sickness, and near death experiences. Research also shows that people also use religious coping to deal with everyday stressors in addition to life-changing traumas. The underlying assumption of the ability of religion to influence the coping process lies in the hypothesis that religion is more than a [[defence mechanism]] as it was viewed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Rather than inspiring denial, religion stimulates reinterpretations of negative events through the sacred lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=D|title=The mediating role of coping in the relationships between religiousness and mental health (2014)|publisher=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spiritual Health''' is one of four dimensions to well-being as defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which include physical, social, and mental.

The preamble to Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO)  adopted by the International Health Conference held in New York from 19 June to 22 July 1946 and signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2002, 80 (12)&lt;/ref&gt; defined health as a state of "physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"&lt;ref&gt;Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization as adopted by the International Health Conference, New York, 19–22 June 1946; signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States (Official Records of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has not been amended.

However, in 1983 twenty-two WHO member countries from the Eastern Mediterranean Region proposed a draft resolution to this preamble to include reference to spiritual health, such that it would redefine health as a state of "physical, mental, spiritual and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity".&lt;ref&gt;Review of the Constitution of the World Health Organization: Report of the Executive Board Special Group. 101st Session. Agenda Item 7.3. 22 January 1998. Geneva: World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst WHO did not amend the preamble to its constitution, resolution WHA31.13 passed by the Thirty-seventh World Health Assembly, in 1984&lt;ref&gt;Thirty-seventh World Health Assembly, Resolution WHA37.13. Geneva: World Health Organization; 1984. WHO document WHA37/1984/REC/1:6.&lt;/ref&gt; called upon Member States to consider including in their [[Health For All]] strategies a spiritual dimension as defined in that resolution in accordance with their own social and cultural patterns
&lt;ref&gt;The fourth ten years of the World Health Organization: 1978–1987. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; recognizing  that "the  spiritual dimension  plays  a great  role in motivating people's achievements in all aspects of life".&lt;ref&gt;Draft Regional Health-for-all Policy and Strategy for the Twenty-First Century. World Health Organization Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean. Forty-fifth Session, Agenda item 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete description of the spiritual dimension as articulated by the Health Assembly is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The spiritual dimension is understood to imply a phenomenon that is not material in nature, but belongs to the realm of ideas, beliefs, values and ethics that have arisen in  the minds and conscience of human beings, particularly ennobling ideas. Ennobling ideas have given rise to health ideals, which have led to a practical strategy for Health for All that aims at attaining a goal that has both a material and non-material component. If the material component of the strategy can be provided to people, the non-material or spiritual one is something that has to arise within people and communities in keeping with their social and cultural patterns. The spiritual dimension plays a great role in motivating people’s achievement in all aspects of life.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization Publication: Year 1991. Issue 9290211407. Chapter 4: The Spiritual Dimension.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the inclusion of spiritual health within WHO's purview, a number of other significant organizations have also attended to spirituality and incorporated reference to it in key documents, including the [[United Nations]] action plan [[Agenda 21]]&lt;ref&gt;Sitarz, Dan. "Agenda 21: The earth summit strategy to save our planet." (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; which recognizes the right of individuals to "healthy physical, mental, and spiritual development".&lt;ref&gt;Agenda 21. Chapter 6.23. United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Rio de Janeiro, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in most Caribbean countries, Christianity is the dominant religion in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Protestantism is most prevalent, reflecting the territory's Danish colonial heritage. There is also a strong Roman Catholic presence. Protestants makes up 59% (Baptist 42%, Episcopalian 17%) of the total religious population on the islands. Roman Catholics are 34% of the religious population.&lt;ref name="Factbook" /&gt;

Today, there are still Jews living in the Islands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirginislands.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The St. Thomas Synagogue built in 1833, is the second-[[Oldest synagogues in the United States|oldest]] existing synagogue and longest in continuous use now under the American flag. The synagogue is associated with the [[Reform Judaism]] movement. There is also a synagogue [http://www.stcroixjewishcommunity.org Temple B'nai Or] at Hermon Hill on St. Croix close to [[Christiansted]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7476">'''Riaumont ''' (literally meaning "royal mountain") is located on the hill of Riaumont, in the [[commune in France|commune]] of [[Liévin]], in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] ''[[département in France|département]]'' in northern [[France]], in the former province of [[Artois]]. It refers to a [[Benedictine]] monastic community, a children's residential village, and a [[Scouting|Scout]] group.

== History ==
The village and religious community was first directed since its formation in the 1960s by Father Revet, until his death in 1986.

Built for young people at the request of the [[DDASS]] (the French social services) and the judges of [[Pas-de-Calais]], this centre and independent school&lt;ref&gt;"Ecole hors contrat" - one of a small number of schools independent of the Education Nationale.&lt;/ref&gt; accepts children with disabilities like [[autism]].  The establishment was a main centre for children placed under the supervision of the DDASS.  The French State financed the construction and the maintenance of the buildings as well as the teachers' salaries.  The children have worked on the various building sites (receptions, farm, chapel, scout building, monastery, etc.), sometimes as a practical placement of vocational teaching courses, helping to transform the initial reception into a [[Catholic]] monastic centre.  In parallel, Father Revet determined to set up a religious scouting movement.

In 1979, the DDASS found serious problems (poor hygiene, food safety conditions and maltreatment), and decided to close the centre in April 1982.  The establishment now accommodates children removed by their families, in particular children originating from South-east [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riaumont.net Riaumont.net - Bienvenue sur Riaumont.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The religious order ==

The religious community of Sainte-Croix ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110928093110/http://www.riaumont.net/religieux/ordre/sainte_Croix/index_html?set_language=en Holy-Cross]) celebrates the liturgy according to the 1962 form of the [[Roman Rite]], under the provisions of the motu proprio ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''. Its states an attribute of a twofold origin: [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] (the monks are Benedictine Oblates) and the scout movement. The frieze and the dress of ceremony refer to religious [[Military order (society)|military orders]]. The main symbol is the potent, distinguished cross of the scouts of [[France]] and originating from the cross of [[kingdom of Jerusalem]].

== The Children Village ==

People can see the works of the painter [[Gerard Ambroselli]] like the fresco in the canopy but also of the drawings and paintings originally from draughtsman and illustrator [[Pierre Joubert (illustrator)|Pierre Joubert]]. Scouting is ubiquitous and the three principal buildings do the activities:  "[[Godefroy de Bouillon]]", "[[Beaumanoir]]" and "Cedars".

=== The boarding school ===

The children from sixth to ninth grade are accommodated with the boarding school [[Holy Jean Bosco]], located in the building "[[Beaumanoir]]".  The pupils need to be prepared for more than ten years for the official examination of [[Brevet des collèges]] which is the first French diploma, obtained after 4 years of junior high school in general and technical areas.  The children have to do the "[[Hattemer course]]" (mail-given / correspondence course) and the courses are given by the brothers of Riaumont as well as by external supply teachers.  The classes are often small between five and about fifteen pupils and they are all the "boys of Riaumont" but the courses of [[catechism]] are also open to other children of different surroundings.  The extracurricular activities are extensive:  [[do-it-yourself]], [[froissartage]], [[penmanship]] and [[printing works]], [[filming|film]] club, games, dealing with the farm and the animals, singing, brass band and music, reading in the library, [[heraldic]] workshop, sports activities, etc.

=== Pedagogy ===

The pedagogy of the school is presented in the form of a return to the [[Christianity|Christian]] realism, inspired by [[scouting]] founded by [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]].  The teaching objective of the school is to carry out a full Christian education by taking it as a starting point of the realism thomist and the pedagogy of scouting.  It is a question of showing, by the practice, the benefits of the traditional scouting which joins with the wisdom of a philosophical [[Thomas d' Aquin|thomist]] in to original reality, by the practice of manual work.  Concerning pedagogy scouts compare some to the description given by the historian of [[scouting]] [[Jean-Jacques Gauthé]] in a newspaper article ''[[Le Monde]]'' on September 2, 1998 entitled ' ' the Little Soldiers of scouting '':  "Defense of the true scouting, since they estimate that this one was denatured by the Scouts de France [...] defense of the true faith through the mass of saint Pie V [...] dispute of the values resulting from the [[Revolution]] of 1789 [...] constant references to the counter-revolution of which they relate to the topics [...] the values which they defend are those of the "ongoing beyond of oneself" by demanding physical activities, virility sometimes resulting in a paramilitary style [...] the testimony to form a Catholic elite is manifest"

== Scouting ==

Stemming from a troop of [[Scouts de France]] in the 1960s, the ''Association des Scouts et Guides de Riaumont'' (Association of the [[Scouting|Scouts]] and [[Girl Guides|Guides]] of Riaumont) passed successively by [[Union Internationale des Guides et Scouts d'Europe|Scouts d'Europe]], [[Scouts Saint-George]] and the [[Association Française de Scouts et Guides Catholiques]]. It is today, a federation affiliated to the [[Eclaireurs Neutres de France]] (ENF), a movement of [[Scouting]] founded in 1947, approved by the ministry for [[Youth and Sports]].  Each weekend, as well as the camp starting every July, the Scout units of Riaumont (willow, wolf cubs, guides, scouts, guides elder and teamster) are opened to all children.  The village has some curiosities which exploited with the Scouting, such monument with the memory of the Scouts who died in France, a "Scout" museum which gathers many badges and parts of uniform resulting from various associations or uniforms and objects which have may belonged to Scout chaplains, or with chaplains of the trenches, lasting until the [[First World War]].  In addition, for the researchers and academics, the "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110928093048/http://www.riaumont.net/scoutisme/labo/index_html?set_language=en Scout laboratory]" gathers many works, newspapers and readings on Scouting.

'''''Shmohawk''''' or '''''schmohawk''''' is a slang term that might have derived from ''[[schmo]]'', a slang term meaning ''fool''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|year = 1989|title = Oxford English Dictionary, second edition|publisher  = Oxford University Press }} &lt;/ref&gt; The [[HBO]] television show ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' gave the word recent notoriety. Earlier uses of the word can be found in the ''[[Crusader Rabbit]]'' animated cartoon "Crusader and the Schmohawk Indians", released in 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title | id=0853400 | title=Crusader and the Schmohawk Indians}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Saul Bellow]]'s 1958 novel ''[[Henderson the Rain King]]''.

''Shmohawk'' or ''schmohawk'' is the word mohawk with the prefix ''shm-.'' In English, this prefix has a mocking or dismissive meaning. The ''shm-'' prefix's English language meaning is borrowed from the [[Yiddish]] language, in which the prefix has been used to similar effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Elaine Gold | title = English Schmenglish | journal = Proceedings of the 2002 annual conference of the [[Canadian Linguistic Association]] | year=2002 | pages=108–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*In the 1985 film ''[[Transylvania 6-5000 (1985 film)|Transylvania 6-5000]]'', [[Jeff Goldblum]]'s character calls [[Ed Begley, Jr.]]'s character a shmohawk after stating he didn't know [[Frankenstein]] was still alive.
*In an episode from season 6 of the HBO show ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', [[Larry David]], the main character, struggles through traffic while his wife Cheryl tries to impress upon her husband the scale of tragedy caused by a large hurricane. Larry yells out to another driver, "Hey dum dum. Go ahead. Move in," and this interaction reminds Larry that his father often used to call bad drivers "shmohawks." Larry continues to use the term in later episodes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1260">'''"So mote it be"''' is a ritual phrase used by [[Freemason]]s, in [[ Rosicrucianism]], and more recently by [[Neopagan]]s.  It means "so may it be", "so it is required", or "so must it be", and may be said at the end of a [[prayer]] in a similar way to "[[amen]]".  The phrase appears in the [[Halliwell Manuscript|Halliwell or Regius Manuscript]], the earliest known document relating to a society of Masons in England dating from the first half of the 15th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Everything Freemasons Book |author=John K.

The phrase has been taken up by [[neopagan]]s and they use it in a similar way in their ceremonies and rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  |title=Neopagan Rites: A Guide to Creating Public Rituals that Work |author=Isaac Bonewits|page=124|isbn=978-0-7387-1199-7|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spirit of Guidance''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]:روح الارشاد, ''Ruh-ul-Irshad'')is the term in [[Universal Sufism]] for Universal Intelligence as it is manifest in the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;''The Heart of Sufism: Essential Writings of Hazrat Inayat Khan''. {{ISBN|1-57062-402-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a Sufi, the diversity of names and forms of the world's religious tendencies are like veils covering the phenomena of the 'Spirit of Guidance' manifested at all levels of evolution. This Inner Guidance is constantly present in the beautiful book of nature's mysteries, which reveals a never-ending Message of Love, providing one's understanding of the relationship between matter and spirit is in harmony with one's feeling heart.

== Main points ==

* The Spirit of Guidance is ''Divine Mind'' in its [[emanation]] in the human mind. The human mind is the microcosm and the divine mind is the macrocosm.&lt;ref&gt;Volume IX – The Unity of Religious Ideals Part III, The Heart of Sufism, Hazrat Inayat Khan&lt;/ref&gt;
* The experiences of every being become the experience of the divine mind, therefore it has knowledge of all beings. It is therefore the sum total of all experience.&lt;ref&gt;Volume VI – The Alchemy of Happiness Our Life's Experience, Hazrat Inayat Khan&lt;/ref&gt;
* Intuition, inspiration, vision, revelation, and prophecy are emanations of the Spirit of Guidance in microcosmic form.
* Every person reflects a spark of the spirit of guidance and act as triggers of guidance in others.
* Some people effectively channel the "central current" of divine mind and therefore reflect guidance more recognisably on others. These people have been known as prophets, teachers, Gurus, etc.
* To realise the spirit of guidance one is taught to clear the outer layers of clutter in the mind which stop one from sensing it.
* It is like a plant that grows and blossoms in response to being cared for.
* It is the essence of [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] ([[Nirvana]]), the light of God. When one is fully aware of and responsive to it, one is said to be "enlightened" and "liberated".
* The 33 beads on the [[Misbaha]] represent the eternity of manifestations of the Divine Mind and the endless possibilities for liberation. Each bead is individual yet the thread tying them together is unchanged and equal to all.

Esther Hicks describes it this way: "When you finally get it that you have this personal relationship with this Stream and that you have this magnificent Guidance System within you that lets you know, in every particle of every moment, what you're doing relative to the Stream, and so, you let your dominant intent be to connect to the Stream and radiate it as much as you can, then, suddenly, everything else falls into its perfect place."&lt;ref&gt;

'''''The Flight to Lucifer: A Gnostic Fantasy''''' is a 1979 novel by the critic [[Harold Bloom]], inspired by his reading of [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]]'s fantasy novel ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' (1920). The plot, which adapts Lindsay's characters and narrative and features themes drawn from [[Gnosticism]], concerns Thomas Perscors, who is transported from Earth to the planet Lucifer by Seth Valentinus.

The book received mainly negative or critical commentary, and was compared, including by Bloom himself, to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977). Bloom eventually repudiated the work.

==Plot summary==
Thomas Perscors ("through fire"), an incarnation of [[Adam Kadmon|Primal Man]], is taken from Earth to the planet Lucifer by Seth Valentinus, a reincarnation of the gnostic theologian [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]]. Their guide is [[tikkun olam|Olam]], who is an [[Gnosticism#Aeons|Aeon]], an emanation of the true god. Lucifer is controlled by [[demiurge|"Saklas"]], which is a Gnostic name for the false creator. Olam has brought Perscors to Lucifer to fight Saklas, and has brought Valentinus so he can remember his true self. Perscors cripples Saklas and changes the order of things across all of Lucifer.{{sfn|Bloom|1979|pages=3–240}}

==Reception==
''The Flight to Lucifer'' received mixed reviews from Martin Bickman in ''[[Library Journal]]'' and the critic [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'',{{sfn|Bickman|1979|page=848}}{{sfn|Leonard|1979}} and a negative review in ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''.{{sfn|''Kirkus Reviews''|1979}} The book was also reviewed by Frank McConnell in ''[[The New Republic]]'' and Marilyn Butler in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' and discussed by the journalist [[David Kipen]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]''.{{sfn|McConnell|1979|pages=32–34}}{{sfn|Butler|1982|pages=11–12}}{{sfn|Kipen|2005|page=177}}

Bickman wrote that, "Despite the often dazzling imagery and the fast narrative pace, a reader without a detailed knowledge of Gnosticism is likely to be disappointed, if not dismayed", but concluded that the book belongs, "in large public and academic collections as another facet of one of our most important and controversial literary theorists."{{sfn|Bickman|1979|page=848}} Leonard compared the book to the science fiction writer [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Children of Dune]]'' (1976) and to ''Star Wars'' (1977), and questioned the accuracy of Bloom's treatment of Gnosticism.{{sfn|Leonard|1979}} ''Kirkus Reviews'' described the book as tedious and, "A close-to-unreadable exercise, only for those who share Bloom's gnostic preoccupations--or collectors of literary oddities."{{sfn|''Kirkus Reviews''|1979}} Kipen dismissed the novel as unsuccessful.{{sfn|Kipen|2005|page=177}}

==Inspiration==
Bloom, writing in ''Agon'' (1982), described ''The Flight to Lucifer'' as his "first attempt at literary fantasy", and explained that it was inspired by David Lindsay's ''A Voyage to Arcturus'' (1920), with his characters "Thomas Perscors" and "Saklas" being the equivalents, respectively, of Lindsay's original characters "Maskull" and "Crystalman". He identified [[Edmund Spenser]] and [[Franz Kafka]] as additional influences on his novel. He gave his relationship to Lindsay's novel, which according to his own account he had "obsessively" read hundreds of times, as an example of his theory of the [[anxiety of influence]]. He considered Lindsay's novel to be superior to his, partly because he attempted deliberately to assimilate Lindsay's characters and narrative to second-century Gnosticism rather than being a "naive Gnostic" like Lindsay, who according to Bloom inadvertently created a personal Gnostic heresy. He wrote that despite its "violent narrative", his novel "has too much trouble getting off the ground" and "reads as though [[Walter Pater]] was writing ''Star Wars''." He nevertheless saw ''The Flight to Lucifer'' as having some merit, and wrote that it "does get better as it goes along" and "towards its close can be called something of a truly weird work".{{sfn|Bloom|1983|pages=206–207, 213, 222–223}}

Bloom stated in a 2015 interview with Daniel D'addario in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine that after re-reading ''The Flight to Lucifer'', he decided that the novel would "never do", and that, "I had to pay the publisher not to have a second printing of the paperback. If I could go around and get rid of all the surviving copies, I would."{{sfn|D'addario|2015|page=64}}

{{alternative medical systems}}
'''Traditional healers of South Africa''' are practitioners of [[traditional African medicine]] in [[Southern Africa]].  They fulfill different social and political roles in the community, including  [[divination]], [[healing]] physical, emotional and [[faith healing|spiritual illnesses]], directing birth or death [[ritual]]s, finding lost cattle, protecting warriors, counteracting [[witchcraft]], and narrating the history, cosmology, and myths of their tradition. There are two main types of traditional healers within the [[Nguni people|Nguni]], [[Sotho-Tswana peoples|Sotho-Tswana]], and [[Tsonga people|Tsonga]] societies of Southern Africa: the [[divination|diviner]] (''sangoma''), and the [[herbalism|herbalist]] (''inyanga''). These healers are effectively [[South Africa]]n [[shamanism|shamans]] who are highly revered and respected in a society where illness is thought to be caused by [[witchcraft]], pollution (contact with impure objects or occurrences) or through neglect of the ancestors.{{sfn|Cumes|2004|p=14}}{{sfn|Campbell|1998|p=38}} It is estimated that there are as many as 200,000 indigenous traditional healers in South Africa compared to 25,000 Western-trained doctors.{{sfn|Truter|2007|p=56-60}}  Traditional healers are consulted by approximately 60% of the South African population, usually in conjunction with modern biomedical services.{{sfn|van Wyk|van Oudtshoorn|Gericke|1999|p=10}}

For harmony between the living and the dead, vital for a trouble-free life, traditional healers believe that the ancestors must be shown respect through ritual and animal sacrifice.{{sfn|Cumes|2004|p=10}} They perform summoning rituals by burning plants like ''imphepho'' (''[[Helichrysum petiolare]]''), dancing, chanting, channelling or playing [[rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|drums]]. Traditional healers will often give their patients ''[[muti]]''—medications made from plant, animal and minerals—imbued with spiritual significance. These muti often have powerful symbolism; for example, [[lion]] fat might be prepared for children to promote courage. There are medicines for everything from physical and mental illness, social disharmony and spiritual difficulties to potions for protection, love and luck.

Although ''sangoma'' is a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] term that is colloquially used to commonly describe all types of Southern African traditional healers, there are differences between practices: an inyanga is concerned mainly with medicines made from plants and animals, while a sangoma relies primarily on divination for healing purposes and might also be considered a type of [[fortune-telling|fortune teller]]. In modern times, [[colonialism]], [[urbanisation]], [[apartheid]] and  [[transculturation]] have blurred the distinction between the two and traditional healers tend to practice both arts.{{sfn|van Wyk|van Oudtshoorn|Gericke|1999|p=10}}{{sfn|Richter|2003|p=8}}{{sfn|Liebhammer|2007|p=196}}&lt;ref name=pretorius&gt;{{cite book|last=Pretorius|first=Engela|title=SAHR 1999|year=1999|publisher=Health Systems Trust|location=Durban|isbn=1-919743-53-7|pages=249–257|editor=Crisp, Nicholas |editor2=Ntuli, Antoinette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional healers can alternate between these roles by diagnosing common illnesses, selling and dispensing remedies for medical complaints, and divining cause and providing solutions to spiritually or socially centred complaints.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|title=The Function of Diviners|year=1936|url=http://www.wits.ac.za/placesofinterest/lifesciencesmuseum/izangoma/indigenous%20healing/2884/the_function_of_diviners.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215111259/http://www.wits.ac.za/placesofinterest/lifesciencesmuseum/izangoma/indigenous%20healing/2884/the_function_of_diviners.html|archivedate=15 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each culture has their own terminology for their traditional healers. [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] traditional healers are known as ''amaxwele'' (herbalists) or ''amagqirha'' (diviners).{{sfn|van Wyk|van Oudtshoorn|Gericke|1999|p=10}} ''Ngaka'' and ''selaoli'' are the terms in [[Northern Sotho language|Northern Sotho]] and [[Sotho language|Southern Sotho]] respectively, while among the [[Venda people|Venda]] they are called ''mungome''.{{sfn|Truter|2007|p=56-60}} The Tsonga refer to their healers as [[Nganga#Shona N'anga|''n'anga'']] or ''mungoma''.{{sfn|Liebhammer|2007|p=171-174}}

==Beliefs and tradition==
[[File:Sangomas-greeting.jpg|thumb|Sangomas greeting each other]]
A sangoma is a practitioner of ''ngoma'', a philosophy based on a belief in [[veneration of the dead|ancestral spirits]] ([[Zulu language|Zulu]]: ''amadlozi''; [[Sotho language|Sesotho]]: ''badimu''; [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]: ''izinyanya'') and the practice of [[traditional African medicine]], which is often a mix of medicinal plants and various animal body fats or skin.{{sfn|Janzen|1992|p=36-37}}{{sfn|Campbell|1998|p=6}}  Sangomas perform a holistic and symbolic form of healing by drawing on the embedded beliefs of the [[Bantu peoples in South Africa]], who believe that ancestors in the afterlife guide and protect the living.{{sfn|Richter|2003|p=9}} Sangomas are called to heal, and through them it is believed that ancestors from the spirit world can give instruction and advice to heal illness, social disharmony and spiritual difficulties.{{sfn|Campbell|1998|p=5-7}}  Traditional healers work in a sacred healing hut or ''indumba'', where they believe their ancestors reside.{{sfn|Cumes|2004|p=127}} Where no physical 'indumba' is available, a makeshift miniature sacred place called ''imsamo'' can be used.

Sangomas believe they are able to access advice and guidance from the ancestors for their patients through [[spirit possession]] by an ancestor, or [[mediumship]], throwing bones, or by [[dream interpretation]].{{sfn|Janzen|1992|p=36-37}} {{sfn|Cumes|2004|p=7-8}} In possession states, the sangoma works themself into a trance through drumming, dancing and chanting, and allows their ego to step aside for an ancestor to take possession of his or her body and communicate directly with the patient, or dancing fervently beyond their stated ability.{{sfn|Cumes|2004|p=9}} The sangoma will provide specific information about the problems of the patient. Some sangomas speak to their patients through normal conversation, whilst others speak in tongues, or languages foreign to their patients, but all languages used by sangomas are indigenous Southern African languages depending on the specific ancestors being called upon. Not all sangomas follow the same rituals or beliefs.

Ancestral spirits can be the personal ancestors of the sangoma or the patient or they might be general ancestors associated with the geographic area or the community.{{sfn|Janzen|1995|p=149}}  It is believed that the spirits have the power to intervene in people's lives who work to connect the sangoma to the spirits that are acting in a manner to cause affliction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Callaway|first=Henry|title=The Religious System of the Amazulu|year=1870|location=Springvale, Natal|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/rsa/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a crab could be invoked as a mediator between the human world and the world of spirits because of its ability to move between the world of the land and the sea.{{sfn|Janzen|1995|p=147-148}} Helping and harming spirits are believed to use the human body as a battleground for their own conflicts. By using ngoma, the sangoma believes they can create harmony between the spirits which is thought to bring an alleviation of the patient's suffering.{{sfn|Campbell|1998|p=39-40}}

The sangoma may burn incense (like ''imphepho'') or sacrifice animals to please the ancestral spirits.{{sfn|van Wyk|van Oudtshoorn|Gericke|1999|p=168}}{{sfn|Arden|1996|p=96}} [[snuff (tobacco)|Snuff]] is also used to communicate with the ancestors through prayer.{{sfn|Cumes|2004|p=13}}

==Divination, diagnosis and healing practices==
A sangoma's goal in healing is to establish a balanced and harmless relationship between the afflicted patient and the spirits that are causing their illness or problem.{{sfn|Campbell|1998|p=39}} The healer intercedes between the patient and the world of the dead in order to make restitution.{{sfn|Cumes|2004|p=10}}  This is generally performed through divination (throwing the bones or ancestral channeling), purification rituals, or animal sacrifice to appease the spirits through atonement.{{sfn|Cumes|2004|p=10}}{{sfn|Cumes|2004|p=7-8}}{{sfn|van Wyk|van Oudtshoorn|Gericke|1999|p=18}}

[[File:Sangoma reading the Bones.jpg|thumb|left|Sangoma performing a divination by reading the bones after being thrown]]
Throwing the bones to access the advice of ancestors is an alternative practice to the exhausting ritual of possession by the ancestor.  In a typical session, a patient will visit the sangoma and the sangoma must determine what the affliction is or the reason the patient has come to them for help. The patient or diviner throws bones on the floor, which may include animal vertebrae, dominoes, dice, coins, shells and stones, each with a specific significance to human life. For example, a [[hyena]] bone signifies a thief and will provide information about stolen objects. The sangoma or the patient throws the bones but the ancestors control how they lie. The sangoma then interprets this metaphor in relation to the patient's afflictions, what the ancestors of the patient require, and how to resolve the disharmony.{{sfn|Cumes|2004|p=43}} In the same way, sangomas will interpret metaphors present in dreams, either their own or their patients.{{sfn|Cumes|2004|p=91}}{{sfn|Campbell|1998|p=38,120}}

When the diviner comes to an acceptable understanding of the problem and the patient agrees, she will instruct the patient on a course of medicine which may include the use of ngoma, referral to a herbalist, inyanga (if the sangoma does not have the knowledge themselves), or recommend a Western medicine regimen.&lt;ref&gt;Rolf P.A. Dauskart "The Changing Geography of Traditional Medicine; urban Herbalism on the witwaterstrand, South Africa" (1990) pp.276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicines and muti==
{{main|muti}}
[[File:Inyanga preparing drying out fresh muti.jpg|thumb|Preparing and drying out freshly picked mutis]]
The [[Traditional medicine|spiritually curative medicines]] prescribed by a traditional healer are called ''muti''. They may be employed in healing as warranted in the opinion of the herbal specialist or inyanga. Muti is a term derived from a [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word for tree.  African [[traditional medicine]] makes extensive use of botanical products but the medicine prescribed by an inyanga may also include other formulations which are zoological or mineral in composition. Traditional medicine uses approximately 3,000 out of 30,000 species of higher plants of Southern Africa.{{sfn|van Wyk|van Oudtshoorn|Gericke|1999|p=7}} In [[South African English]] and [[Afrikaans]], the word muti is sometimes used as a [[List of South African slang words#Words from Xhosa, Zulu and the other Nguni Languages|slang term]] for medicine in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trip Advisor: South Africa: Important Phrases |url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g293740-s604/South-Africa:Important.Phrases.html|publisher=Trip Advisor|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Mutis are prepared, and depending on the affliction, a number of purification practices can be administered.  These practices include bathing, vomiting, steaming, nasal ingestion, enemas, and cuttings:{{sfn|van Wyk|van Oudtshoorn|Gericke|1999|p=18}}

# Bathing – Herbal mixtures are added to bath water to purify the patient
# Vomiting (''phalaza'') – A large volume (up to 2 litres) of a weak, lukewarm herbal infusion is drunk and a process of self-induced vomiting occurs to cleanse and tone the system.
# Steaming (''futha'') – Medicinal herbs are commonly inhaled by steaming them in a bucket of boiling water.  A blanket is used to cover the patient and container.  Hot rocks or a portable stove may be included to keep the bucket boiling. The patient sits under the blanket, breathes in the herbal steam and sweats.
# Nasally – A variety of plants can be taken dried and powdered as snuff.  Some are taken to induce sneezing which may traditionally be believed to aid the expulsion of disease.  Others are taken for the common conditions such as headaches.
# Enemas – Infusions and some decoctions are commonly administered as enemas.  The enema is a preferred route of administration of certain plant extracts, as it is believed they are more effective when administered this way.
# Cuttings (''umgaba'') – Extracts or powders are directly applied to small cuts made with a razor blade in the patients skin.

An experienced inyanga will generally seek the guidance of an ancestral spirit before embarking to find and collect muti. The healer, through dreams or during prayers, believes they are advised of auspicious times for collecting the plants. In some cases, symbols and dreams are also interpreted to determine which particular plants to collect for a specific patient and where these plants are located.  The healer supplements the perceived advice from an ancestral spirit with their own knowledge, training and experience.{{sfn|van Wyk|van Oudtshoorn|Gericke|1999|p=14}}

==Thwasa and initiation==
[[File:Goat Sacrifice at Thwasa Initiation.jpg|thumb|An initiate (''ithwasa'') being led towards the goat that will be sacrificed at her initiation into becoming a sangoma.]]Both men and women can become traditional healers. A sangoma is believed to be "called" to heal through an initiation illness; symptoms involve [[psychosis]], [[headache]]s, intractable stomach pain, shoulder or neck complaints or illness that cannot be cured by conventional methods.&lt;ref&gt;Connor/Keeney "Shamans of the World" (2008) pp118&lt;/ref&gt; These problems together must be seen by a sangoma as ''twasa'' or the calling of the ancestors. Sangomas believe that failure to respond to the calling will result in further illness until the person concedes and goes to be trained.{{sfn|Cumes|2004|p=11}}  The word ''twasa'' is derived from ''thwasa'' which means 'the light of the new moon' or from ''ku mu thwasisa'' meaning 'to led to the light'.{{sfn|Janzen|1995|p=145-146}}

A trainee sangoma (or ''ithwasa'') trains formally under another sangoma for a period of anywhere between a number of months and many years. The training involves learning humility to the ancestors, purification through steaming, washing in the blood of sacrificed animals, and the use of [[muti]], medicines with spiritual significance.{{sfn|Campbell|1998|p=48}}{{sfn|Cumes|2004|p=41, 43–44}}  The ithwasa may not see their families during training and must abstain from sexual contact and often live under harsh and strict conditions.{{sfn|Campbell|1998|p=48}} This is part of the cleansing process to prepare the healer for a life's work of dedication to healing and the intense experiences of training tend to earn a deeply entrenched place in the sangoma's memory.{{sfn|Campbell|1998|p=48}}

During the training period the ithwasa will share their ailments in the form of song and dance, a process that is nurtured by the analysis of dreams, anxieties, and with prayer.  The story develops into a song which becomes a large part of the graduation-type ceremony that marks the end of the ithwasa's training.{{sfn|Janzen|1995|p=146-148}}  At times in the training, and for the graduation, a ritual [[animal sacrifice|sacrifice of an animal]] is performed (usually chickens and a goat or a cow).{{sfn|Arden|1996|p=85}}{{sfn|Campbell|1998|p=70}} 

At the end of thwasa and during initiation, a goat is sacrificed to call to the ancestors and appease them. The local community, friends and family are all invited to the initiation to witness and celebrate the completion of training. The ithwasa is also tested by the local elder sangomas to determine whether they have the skills and insight necessary to heal.  The climactic initiation test is to ensure the ithwasa has the ability to "see" things hidden from view.  This is signified and proved when other sangomas hide the ithwasa's sacred objects, including the gall bladder of the goat that was sacrificed and the ithwasa must, in front of the community, call upon their ancestors, find the hidden objects and return them back to the sangomas that hid them, thus proving they have the ability to "see" beyond the physical world.{{sfn|Campbell|1998|p=71, 101}}{{sfn|Arden|1996|p=226}}

==Drumming and ancestral dancing==
[[File:Sangoma Dancing in Celebration of his Ancestors.jpg|thumb|Sangoma in traditional attire dancing in celebration of his ancestors]]
Sangoma can also literally mean 'person of the drum' or 'the drumming one' &lt;ref name="ZuluMedicine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Alfred T|year=1970|title=Zulu Medicine and Medicine-Men|location=Cape Town|publisher=Gothic|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and drumming is an important part of summoning the ancestors.  During times of celebration (e.g. at an Initiation) the possessed sangoma is called to dance and celebrate their ancestors.  The sangoma will fall into trance where the ancestors will be channeled (which is signified in Zulu traditions by episodes of convulsive fits) followed by the singing of ancestral songs. These songs are echoed back to the ancestor via the audience in a process of [[Call and response (music)|call and response]].  The possessed sangoma will then change into their traditional ancestral clothing and dance vigorously while others [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|drum]] and sing in celebration.{{sfn|Cumes|2004|p=9}}

==History and background==

The [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word with prefix is ''isangoma'' (pl. ''izangoma''), alternatively it is also spelled as ''umngoma'' (pl. ''abangoma''), ''sa ngoma'' means 'do ''ngoma'' and ''i sa ngoma'' means "those who do ''ngoma''", so ''sangoma'' or ''isangoma'' refers specifically to the practitioner of the ''ngoma'' practice.{{sfn|Janzen|1995|p=146-148}} 
[[File:Sangoma performing a Baptism.jpg|thumb|left|Sangoma/N'anga in Johannesburg, South Africa, performing a traditional baptism to protect the spirit of the baby]]
The term sangoma is often used colloquially in South Africa for equivalent professions in other [[Bantu peoples|Bantu cultures]] in [[Southern Africa]].{{sfn|Truter|2007|p=56-60}}  Forms of the ''ngoma'' ritual are practiced throughout southern and south-eastern Africa in countries such as [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Mozambique]], [[Lesotho]], [[Kenya]], and [[Batswana]]. In more northern areas the practices are generally more diverse and less organized than the southern practices.{{sfn|Janzen|1995|p=142}} Among the [[Kongo people|Kongo]], the practice is called ''loka'' or more negatively ''doga'', a term meaning witchcraft.{{sfn|Janzen|1995|p=154-157}}

Ngoma is believed to have come to southern Africa during the [[Bantu expansion|western Bantu migration]] that began around 2000 BCE and was further influenced by the [[Bantu expansion|eastern Bantu migration]] that occurred until 500 CE.{{sfn|Janzen|1995|p=154-157}}  The practice has evolved along with the social problems of its users. In pre-colonial form ngoma songs dealt mainly with issues of hunting. Over time the system adapted to include the introduction of guns, and later the racial and class struggles of practitioners under colonial rule.{{sfn|Janzen|1995|p=154-157}} In Zimbabwe, the civil war experience lead to a revival of ngoma practice with a new emphasis on the spirits of the victims of war.  The service allowed the sangoma to help people cope with their own violent acts as well as those they had fallen victim to.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Janzen "'Doing Ngoma': A Dominant Trope in African Religion and Healing" (1991) pp.306&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this is the [[Tsonga people|Tsonga]] who believe that one of the main alien spirits that can bestow powers of clairvoyance and the ability to detect [[witchcraft]] is the Ndau Spirit.&lt;ref name="VB:QIPCA:97"&gt;{{cite book|last=Broch-Due|first=Vigdis|title=Violence And Belonging:The Quest For Identity In Post-Colonial Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8bGqbQ15cKoC&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=10 July 2012|year=2005|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ndau spirit possesses the descendants of the [[Gaza Empire|Gaza soldiers]] who had slain the [[Ndau people|Ndau]] and taken their wives.&lt;ref  name="VB:QIPCA:97"/&gt; Once the Ndau spirit has been converted from hostile to benevolent forces, the spirits bestow the powers of divination and healing on the n'angna.{{sfn|Liebhammer|2007|p=171-174}}

In addition, ngoma has been adapted by many to include both Christian and Muslim beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Janzen "'Doing Ngoma': A Dominant Trope in African Religion and Healing" (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
Sangomas are legally recognised in South Africa as "traditional health practitioners", under the ''Traditional Health Practitioners Act of 2007 (Act. 22 of 2007)'' as diviners alongside herbalists, traditional birth attendants, and traditional surgeons. The act calls for the establishment of a national council of traditional health practitioners to regulate and register a.o. sangomas in the country.&lt;ref name=THPA&gt;[http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77788 Traditional Health Practitioners Act 22 of 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116022830/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77788 |date=16 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was only in December 2011 that the [[Department of Health (South Africa)|National Department of Health]] took action and opened nominations for seats on an interim council. In October 2012, Health Department spokesperson Joe Maila advised that the Department aimed to have the council up and running by the end of 2012.&lt;ref name=Shonisani&gt;{{cite news|last=Shonisani|first=Tshifhiwa|title=Healers threaten poll boycott|publisher=citizen.co.za|date=13 May 2011|url=http://www.citizen.co.za/citizen/content/en/citizen/local-news?oid=194122&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=334&amp;Healers-threaten--poll-boycott|accessdate=16 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521074002/http://www.citizen.co.za/citizen/content/en/citizen/local-news?oid=194122&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=334&amp;Healers-threaten--poll-boycott|archivedate=21 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice of Nominations: Traditional Health Practitioners Act, 2007 (Act no. 22 of 2007)|url=http://www.doh.gov.za/docs/forms/2011/nomination_frm.pdf|publisher=Department of Health|accessdate=25 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105110602/http://www.doh.gov.za/docs/forms/2011/nomination_frm.pdf|archivedate=5 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jasson da Costa|first=Wendy|title=Traditional healers to be regulated|publisher=thepost.co.za|date=23 October 2012|url=http://www.thepost.co.za/traditional-healers-to-be-regulated-1.1408868#.UIfo8W_A809|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Interim Traditional Health Practitioners Council was eventually inaugurated on 12 February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech by Deputy Minister Gwen Ramokgopa at the inauguration of the interim Traditional Health Practitioners Council of South Africa|url=http://www.info.gov.za/speech/DynamicAction?pageid=461&amp;sid=34235&amp;tid=98563|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130421215943/http://www.info.gov.za/speech/DynamicAction?pageid=461&amp;sid=34235&amp;tid=98563|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 April 2013|date=12 February 2013|publisher=South African Government Information|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Makhubu|first=Ntando|title=Traditional healers and their medicine to be formalised|url=http://www.iol.co.za/pretoria-news/traditional-healers-and-their-medicine-to-be-formalised-1.1469629#.USTURh1vCz4|accessdate=20 February 2013|newspaper=Pretoria News|date=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several sections of the act, dealing with the establishment and governance of the national council and the registration of practitioners, came into effect on 1 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sections of Traditional Health Practitioners Act Commence|url=http://www.sabinetlaw.co.za/health/articles/sections-traditional-health-practitioners-act-commence|date=5 May 2014|website=Sabinet|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the [[Parliament of South Africa|South African Parliament]] had passed the ''Traditional Health Practitioners Act of 2004 (Act. 35 of 2004)''. However, the act was ruled [[unconstitutional]] after Doctors for Life International challenged it at the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], citing the insufficient public participation at provincial level in the drafting of the act.&lt;ref name=voyi&gt;{{cite web|last=Voyi|first=Ndumiso|title=Sangoma sick notes invalid|url=http://www.hrfuture.net/legal/sangoma-sick-notes-invalid.php?Itemid=938|publisher=HR future|accessdate=25 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304125135/http://www.hrfuture.net/legal/sangoma-sick-notes-invalid.php?Itemid=938|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South African Law Reform Commission]] received a submission from the Traditional Healers Organisation requesting the investigation of the constitutionality of the [[Witchcraft Suppression Act, 1957|Witchcraft Suppression Act of 1957]]&lt;ref&gt;{{wikisource-inline|Witchcraft Suppression Act, 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mpumalanga Witchcraft Suppression Bill|Mpumalanga Witchcraft Suppression Bill of 2007]], the drafting of which was suspended in 2008.

==White sangomas==
[[File:Sangoma Initiates being greeted and welcomed.jpg|thumb|After a successful initiation in [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra Township]], Johannesburg, Gogo Mashele of the Tshwane Traditional &amp; Faith Healers Forum welcomes new sangomas (including a white thwasa)]]
While there are recorded instances of white sangomas before 1994, since 1994 an increasing number of white people have openly trained as sangomas in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wreford|first=Joanne Thobeka|title='Long-Nosed' Hybrids?

According to Nokuzola Mndende of the Icamagu Institute, a Xhosa sangoma and former lecturer in [[religious studies]] at the [[University of Cape Town]]:{{quote|An igqirha is someone who has been called by their ancestors to heal, whether from the maternal or paternal side, they can't be called by [somebody else's] ancestors.&lt;ref name="bigissue"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bosworth|first=Brendon|title=Testing time for white sangomas|url=http://www.streetnewsservice.org/news/2010/july/feed-242/testing-time-for-white-sangomas-.aspx|publisher=The Big Issue South Africa|accessdate=5 January 2012|date=26 July 2010}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Philip Kubekeli, director of the Traditional Medical Practitioners, Herbalist and Spiritual Healers Association, and Phephsile Maseko, spokesperson of the Traditional Healers Organisation, see nothing wrong with white sangomas.

Several white sangomas, interviewed by [[The Big Issue]] in 2010, claimed that they have been welcomed by the black community in South Africa, aside from isolated experiences of hostility.&lt;ref name="bigissue"/&gt; On the other hand, there have also been reports that white sangomas have been less readily accepted by black sangomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaganof|first=Agan|title=Who's healing WHO?|url=http://www.chimurenganewsroom.org.za/?p=1796|publisher=Chimurenga|accessdate=5 January 2012|date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ngcai|first=Sabata|title=Sangomas take UCT by storm But where does the white sangoma fit in|url=http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/citypress/2001/04/22/18/2.html|publisher=City Press|accessdate=5 January 2012|date=7 March 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609152545/http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/citypress/2001/04/22/18/2.html|archivedate=9 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of the South African traditions (e.g. [[Swazi people|Swazi]]{{sfn|Campbell|1998|p=50-51}} and [[Tsonga people|Tsonga/Shangaan]]{{sfn|Liebhammer|2007|p=171-174}}) believe that a foreign or alien spirit can call one to become a traditional healer,&lt;ref name="VB:QIPCA:97"/&gt; especially if there is a significant extreme relationship between one of the healer's biological ancestors and the foreign spirit that occurred in the past. Dr Nhlavana Maseko, founder of the Traditional Healers Organisation, explains: {{quote|Foreign spirits are not of your family.  That is all it means.  Foreign spirits are not your ancestors.  My forefathers, for instance, were warriors and they killed some people.  When these people were killed, they become my family's foreign spirits.  There must be a working relationship with your foreign spirit and your ancestors.  They have something, an injustice, a murder that must be worked out, must be healed.  During training, as the ancestors come out, you have to finish up with your own ancestors first.  That relationship sorts itself out, then you are ready to work with the foreign spirits.  It happens in a natural way.  The ancestors do the work through you. Maybe the foreign spirit want to be the important or senior ancestor; when the ancestor of your clan comes, well, they may have to fight it out.  You might feel some aches during this time.  It is friction among them that is working itself out.{{sfn|Campbell|1998|p=50-51}}}}

==Relationship with Western medicine==
[[File:Inyanga in Ndumba.jpg|thumb|Inyanga in her ndumba, a sacred hut used for healing.  Behind her are her [[Traditional African medicine|mutis]], medicine stored in containers.]]
The formal health sector has shown continued interest in the role of sangomas and the efficacy of their herbal remedies. [[Botanists]] and [[Pharmacology|pharmaceutical scientists]] continue to study the ingredients of traditional medicines in use by sangomas.{{sfn|van Wyk|van Oudtshoorn|Gericke|1999|p=7}}  Well known contributions to world medicine from South African herbal remedies include [[Aloe ferox|aloe]], [[Agathosma|buchu]] and [[Harpagophytum|devil's claw]].{{sfn|van Wyk|van Oudtshoorn|Gericke|1999|p=8}} Public health specialists are now enlisting sangomas in the fight, not only against the spread of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], but also [[diarrhoea]] and [[pneumonia]], which are major causes of death in rural areas, especially in children.{{sfn|Richter|2003|p=8}}{{sfn|Campbell|1998|p=151-153}} In the past decade, the role of  traditional healers has become important in fighting the impact of HIV and treating people infected with the virus before they advance to a point where they require (or can obtain) anti-retroviral drugs.{{sfn|Richter|2003|p=16-18}}{{sfn|King|2010|p=18}}  A conclusion from a review by [[UNAIDS]] in September 2000, regarding collaboration with traditional healers in HIV/AIDS prevention and care, found that modern and traditional belief systems are not incompatible, but complementary.{{sfn|King|2010|p=22}}

Estimates of the number of indigenous traditional healers in South Africa ranged up to 200,000 in 1999, compared to 25,000 Western-trained doctors.{{sfn|Truter|2007|p=56-60}}  Traditional healers are consulted first (or exclusively) by approximately 60% of the African population.{{sfn|van Wyk|van Oudtshoorn|Gericke|1999|p=10}}

While for many they provide the healing needed, there are some causes for concern. [[Charlatan]]s who have not undergone thwasa charge exorbitant prices for fraudulent service, and not all countries in southern Africa have effective regulatory bodies to prevent this practice. Some sangomas have been known to abuse the charismatic power they have over their patients by sexually assaulting them, sometimes dressed up as ritual. Repeated use of the same [[razor|razor blade]] to make incisions for [[muti]] carries [[HIV]] transmission risks in regions where the disease is rife. Western-style doctors have seen a number of cases of patients with serious gastrointestinal problems through the use of muti, especially in enema form, and have coined the phrase "ritual enema induced colitis" to describe the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Segal|first=I|author2=Solomon A |author3=Mirwis J. |title=Radiological manifestations of ritual-enema-induced colitis.|journal=Clin Radiol|date=November 1981|volume=32|issue=6|pages=657–662|doi=10.1016/s0009-9260(81)80334-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraudulent sangomas and scam artists==

Due to the heavy influx of [[West Africa|Western]] and [[East African Community|East African]] migrants, a large number of mainly unemployed or unskilled foreign nationals have taken advantage of the local population's respect and trust of sangomas and have set up bogus healing practices, where they exploit clients for as much money as possible. These charlatans often call themselves doctors or professors and claim themselves as sangomas, faith healers, psychics or as traditional healers, but have no legitimate references and are not trained as such.&lt;ref name="IOL:SHRINE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside the Fake healers shrine|url=http://africawitness.wordpress.com/2011/02/11/366/|date=11 February 2011|publisher=Africa Witness|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IOL:FAKE_TH"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Esther|title=Traditional healers: what you need to know|url=http://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/traditional-healers-what-you-need-to-know-1.1422478#.UaB3sdI3Cz5|accessdate=26 May 2013|newspaper=IOL Lifestyle|date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IOL:WW_SCAM"/&gt;  In the [[Western Cape|Cape]], they often adopt [[Arabic Name|Muslim sounding names]] in order to attract the local [[Cape Coloured]] population, who are in part [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name="IOL:SHRINE"/&gt;

Legitimate sangomas and South African traditional healing organisations are angered by these charlatans and are working to end the trade of bogus traditional healers and fake sangomas through regulation, legal action and awareness.  They believe the charlatans harm the reputation of the legitimate traditional healers and also damage the lives of many innocent people.&lt;ref Name="FAKE_BOGUSSAN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sangomas and healers must register|url=http://www.looklocal.co.za/looklocal/content/en/north-east-joburg/north-east-joburg-news-municipal?oid=6604458&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=490272&amp;Sangomas-and-healers-must-register|accessdate=27 May 2013|newspaper=Look Local|date=5 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111191359/http://www.looklocal.co.za/looklocal/content/en/north-east-joburg/north-east-joburg-news-municipal?oid=6604458&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=490272&amp;Sangomas-and-healers-must-register|archive-date=11 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a general rule, sangomas tend not to advertise through flyers or posters.  They tend to rely more on their reputation, word of mouth and their trust in their ancestors to bring them the right clients.

Mary Bungeni, a sangoma herself, explains: {{quote|Sangomas don’t do miracles and there is no such a thing as doubling a person’s money. They only help to connect with the ancestors, who gives them directions on how to heal and assist people in need. The ancestors get angry when people play with their name and end up taking away the powers and calling given to a person. The [real] sangomas are not rich because they are controlled by the ancestors. The bogus sangomas cause people to not believe [in the] ancestors, because they lie about their work with the ancestors.&lt;ref Name="FAKE_BOGUSSAN"/&gt;}}

Dr Motlalepula Matsabisa, director of the Medical Research Council’s Indigenous Knowledge Unit, says there appears to be many fake traditional healers from Eastern and Western Africa around, however because of a lack of regulation, they go unchecked and explains that if anyone can bring about good luck and predict lotto numbers, they wouldn’t be poor themselves. However, he also warns that people should not be gullible.&lt;ref name="IOL:FAKE_TH"/&gt;

Phephsile Maseko, national co-ordinator of the Traditional Healers Organisation (THO) says: {{quote|A true healer is someone who has been through initiation, inducted by an expert in the field, who has undergone rigorous training and completed external healing courses. If a patient complains of headaches, they will be given plants with painkilling properties. But the healer will also try to establish the root cause of the headaches, and treat that too. This may mean the healer will provide counselling to the patient. Treatment is usually holistic, and a once-off ointment will generally not do the trick. Many clients come for help with their relationships or marriages. A potion may be given to open the communication channels between couples, so that they can speak about their problems. Counselling will also be on offer, but there is no quick-fix solution.&lt;ref name="IOL:FAKE_TH"/&gt;}}

In [[Judaism]], '''trope''' (or [[Yiddish]] טראָפּ ''trop'') is the musical pronunciation associated with the [[cantillation]] marks (accents) used for the ritual [[chanting]] of the [[Torah]].

==For Hebrew==
{{main|Cantillation}}
Historically, the Torah has been chanted to a regularized tune and rhythm.  This made memorization of the text (in Hebrew) far easier, and acts as a form of [[Mnemonic| memory aid]].  It also provides a musical element to the reading and services.

The language of [[Biblical Hebrew|Ancient Hebrew]] had no written vowels; to a speaker of the time who could concurrently understand the text, there was, however, little ambiguity: the context would make clear the appropriate (unwritten) vowels to insert before, between or after the written consonants so that the words, as a group, formed a sensible sentence. To help later readers of what became a [[dead language]], a system of vowel markings (dots, dashes, and other symbols above and below the consonants) called [[niqqud|pointing]] was established. The [[Torah]] itself, however, is always in non-pointed Ancient Hebrew.

Trope relies on a similar set of independent markings above and below the Ancient Hebrew letters, but these are a form of [[musical notation]] indicating the stylized pitches and rhythms to be applied to the syllables of the Hebrew word during the chanting.  Ancient Hebrew, when marked with both pointing and trope, makes it possible for a modern reader to pronounce and musically chant the words and phrases without needing to rely on any understanding of the ancient language, nor a memory of the musical form (just as Western musical notation accompanied by printed lyrics allows someone to sing a song they have not heard before).

==Other meanings==
In [[Moravian church]], a trope is one of the divisions which forms the [[Unity of the Brethren]].

In the [[Western Church]], a trope is a phrase, sentence, or verse introduced as embellishment into some part of the text of the [[Mass_(liturgy)|Mass]] or [[breviary]] [[Liturgy of the Hours|office]] that is sung by the [[choir]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7862">'''White Lotus Day''' is a celebration of [[Theosophists]]. It is celebrated [[8 May]], the anniversary of the death of [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]], founder of the [[Theosophical Society]]. Though there are several [[Theosophical Society|theosophical organisations]], this is one celebration they have in common.

White Lotus Day is a celebration that encourages meditation about the [[metaphor]] of the [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]]. The lotus is born under the mud, growing through the water to achieve the surface, and therefore the air and the light of sun.
This growth is identified with man's life, born in earth but desiring the elevation to the air; representing his middle stage between animals and the ultimate reality. The seeds of lotus contain (even before they germinate) perfectly formed leaves, a miniature shape of what they would become.
This flower is often present in eastern religions, which influence is key in the Theosophical Movement.

:'''Lotus''' (''Gr.''). A most occult plant, sacred in Egypt, India and else where; called “the child of the Universe bearing the likeness of its mother in its bosom”. There was a time “when the world was a golden lotus” (''padma'') says the allegory. A great variety of these plants, from the majestic Indian lotus, down to the marsh-lotus (bird’s foot trefoil) and the Grecian “Dioscoridis”, is eaten at Crete and other islands. It is a species of nymphala, first introduced from India to Egypt to which it was-not indigenous. See the text of ''Archaic Symbolism'' in the Appendix Viii. “The Lotus, as a Universal Symbol”.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky H.P. [http://www.phx-ult-lodge.org/Thegloss.htm ''The Theosophical Glossary''.] London: TPS, 1892.&amp;nbsp;– P. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
;White Lotus Day
In her will, [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]] suggested that her friends might gather together on the anniversary of her death (May 8, 1891) and read from [[Edwin Arnold|Sir Edwin Arnold's]] ''[[The Light of Asia]]'' and from ''[[The Bhagavad Gita]].'' Lotuses grew in unusual profusion one year later. Hence, May 8 became known as White Lotus Day.
:ONE of the symbolic figures for the Dual creative power in Nature (matter and force on the material plane) is ''Padma,'' the water lily of India. The Lotus is the product of heat (fire) and water (vapour or Ether); fire standing in every philosophical and religious system as a representation of the Spirit of Deity, the active, male, generative principle; and Ether, or the Soul of matter, the light of the fire, for the receptive female principle from which everything in this Universe emanated. Hence, Ether or Water is the Mother, and Fire is the Father. Sir W. Jones (and before him archaic botany) showed that the seeds of the Lotus contain&amp;nbsp;— even before they germinate&amp;nbsp;— perfectly formed leaves, the miniature shape of what one day, as perfect plants, they will become: nature thus giving us a specimen of the preformation of its production ...the seed of all phanerogamous plants bearing proper flowers containing an embryo plantlet ready formed.

:The Lotus, or ''Padma,'' is, moreover, a very ancient and favourite simile for the Kosmos itself, and also for man. The popular reasons given are, firstly, the fact just mentioned, that the Lotus-seed contains within itself a perfect miniature of the future plant, which typifies the fact that the spiritual prototypes of all things materialised on Earth. Secondly, the fact that the Lotus plant grows up through the water, having its root in the Ilus, or mud, and spreading its flower in the air above. The Lotus thus typifies the life of man and also that of the Kosmos; for the Secret Doctrine teaches that the elements of both are the same, and that both are developing in the same direction. The root of the Lotus sunk in the mud represents material life, the stalk passing up through the water typifies existence in the astral world, and the flower floating on the water and opening to the sky is emblematical of spiritual being. (The Secret Doctrine I, 57-58.)&lt;ref&gt;THEOSOPHY, Vol. 89, Issue 4, May/June 2001 (Pages 165-166). // Transcribed from www.wisdomworld.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==More explanation==
'''STANZA II.'''&amp;nbsp;— ''Continued.''

3.  THE HOUR HAD NOT YET STRUCK; THE RAY HAD NOT YET FLASHED INTO THE GERM (a); THE MATRI-PADMA (''mother lotus'') HAD NOT YET SWOLLEN (b).*

(a) The ray of the “Ever Darkness” becomes, as it is emitted, a ray of effulgent light or life, and flashes into the “Germ”&amp;nbsp;— the point in the Mundane Egg, represented by matter in its abstract sense.  But the term “Point” must not be understood as applying to any particular point in Space, for a germ exists in the centre of every atom, and these collectively form “the Germ;” or rather, as no atom can be made visible to our physical eye, the collectivity of these (if the term can be applied to something which is boundless and infinite) forms the noumenon of eternal and indestructible matter.

(b) One of the symbolical figures for the Dual creative power in Nature (matter and force on the material plane) is ''Padma,'' the water-lily of India.  The Lotus is the product of heat (fire) and water (vapour or Ether); fire standing in every philosophical and religious system as a representation of the Spirit of Deity,† the active, male, generative principle; and Ether, or the Soul of matter, the light of the fire, for the receptive female principle from which everything in this Universe emanated.  Hence, Ether or Water is the Mother, and Fire is the Father.  Sir W. Jones (and before him archaic botany) showed that the seeds of the Lotus contain&amp;nbsp;— even before they germinate&amp;nbsp;— perfectly formed leaves, the miniature shape of what one day, as perfect plants, they will become:  nature thus giving us a specimen of the preformation of its production . . . the seed of all phanerogamous plants bearing proper flowers containing an embryo plantlet ready formed.‡ (See Part II., “The Lotus Flower as a Universal Symbol.”) This explains the sentence “The Mother had not yet swollen”&amp;nbsp;— the form being usually sacrificed to the inner or root idea in Archaic symbology.

The Lotus, or Padma, is, moreover, a very ancient and favourite simile for the Kosmos itself, and also for man.  The popular reasons given are, firstly, the fact just mentioned, that the Lotus-seed contains within itself a perfect miniature of the future plant, which typefies the fact that the spiritual prototypes of all things exist in the immaterial world before those things become materialised on Earth.  Secondly, the fact that the Lotus plant grows up through the water, having its root in the Ilus, or mud, and spreading its flower in the air above.  The Lotus thus typifies the life of man and also that of the Kosmos; for the Secret Doctrine teaches that the elements of both are the same, and that both are developing in the same direction.  The root of the Lotus sunk in the mud represents material life, the stalk passing up through the water typifies existence in the astral world, and the flower floating on the water and opening to the sky is emblematical of spiritual being.&lt;br/&gt;

Xolotl was the god of [[fire]] and [[lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;Johns 2008 p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; He was also god of [[twins]], monsters, misfortune, sickness, and deformities. Xolotl is the canine brother and twin of [[Quetzalcoatl]],&lt;ref&gt;Milbrath 2013 p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; the pair being sons of the virgin [[Coatlicue]]. He is the [[dark]] personification of [[Venus]], the evening star, and was associated with heavenly fire.

[[File:Xolotl muz.jpg|thumb|left|Xolotl statue displayed at the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología]] in [[Mexico City]].]]
[[File:Kodeks_borbonic.jpg#/media/File:Kodeks_borbonic.jpg|thumb| [[Codex Borbonicus]] (p. 16) Xolotl is depicted as a companion of the Setting Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Milbrath 2013 p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; He is pictured with a knife in his mouth, a symbol of death.&lt;ref&gt;Neumann 1975 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Xolotl was the sinister god of monstrosities who wears the spirally-twisted wind jewel and the ear ornaments of Quetzalcoatl.&lt;ref&gt;Seler 2010 p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; His job was to protect the sun from the dangers of the underworld. As a double of Quetzalcoatl, he carries his [[conch]]-like ehecailacacozcatl or wind jewel. Xolotl accompanied Quetzalcoatl to [[Mictlan]], the land of the dead, or the underworld, to retrieve the bones from those who inhabited the previous world (Nahui Atl) to create new life for the present world, Nahui Ollin, the sun of movement. In a sense, this re-creation of life is reacted every night when Xolotl guides the sun through the underworld. In the [[tonalpohualli]], Xolotl rules over day Ollin (movement) and over [[trecena]] 1-Cozcacuauhtli (vulture).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= azteccalendar.com
 |url= https://www.azteccalendar.com/god/Xolotl.html
 |title= Xolotl, the Twin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His empty eye sockets are explained in the legend of [[Teotihuacan]], in which the gods decided to sacrifice themselves for the newly created sun. Xolotl withdrew from this sacrifice and wept so much his eyes fell out of their sockets.&lt;ref name="Seler 2010 p. 94"&gt;Seler 2010 p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the creation recounted in the [[Florentine Codex]] , after the [[Fifth Sun]] was initially created, it did not move. [[Ehecatl]] ("God of Wind") consequently began slaying all other gods to induce the newly created Sun into movement. Xolotl, however, was unwilling to die in order to give movement to the new Sun. Xolotl transformed himself into a young [[maize]] plant with two stalks (xolotl), a doubled [[Agave americana|maguey]] plant (mexolotl), and an amphibious animal ([[axolotl]]). Xolotl is thus a master transformer. In the end, Ehecatl succeeded in finding and killing Xolotl.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In art, Xolotl was typically depicted as a [[Dogs in Mesoamerican folklore and myth|dog]]-headed man, a [[skeleton]], or a deformed monster with reversed feet. An [[incense burner]] in the form of a skeletal canine depicts Xolotl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= ancient.eu

 |title= Xolotl (Illustration)}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[psychopomp]], Xolotl would guide the dead on their journey to [[Mictlan]] the [[afterlife]] in myths. His two spirit animal forms are the [[Mexican Hairless Dog|Xoloitzcuintli]] dog and the water salamander species known as the [[Axolotl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= mexicolore.co.uk
 |url= http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/stories/story-of-the-fifth-sun
 |title=Story of the Fifth Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xolos served as companions to the Aztecs in this life and also in the after-life, as many dog remains and dog sculptures have been found in Aztec burials, including some at the main temple in [[Tenochtitlan]]. Dogs were often victims of ritual sacrifice so that they could accompany their master on his voyage through Mictlan, the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= mexicolore.co.uk
 |url= http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/flora-and-fauna/dog
 |title= Dog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their main duty was to help their owners cross a deep river. It is possible that dog sculptures also found in burials were also intended to help people on this journey. Xoloitzcuintli is the official name of the [[Mexican Hairless Dog]] (also known as ''perro pelón mexicano'' in [[Mexican Spanish]]), a [[pre-Columbian]] canine breed from [[Mesoamerica]] dating back to over 3500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= xoloitzcuintliclubofamerica.org
 |url= http://www.xoloitzcuintliclubofamerica.org/about_xolos
 |title= About Xolos}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of many native dog breeds in the [[Americas]] and it is often confused with the [[Peruvian Hairless Dog]]. The name "Xoloitzcuintli" references Xolotl because this dog's mission was to accompany the souls of the dead in their journey into [[eternity]]. The name "Axolotl" comes from Nahuatl, the Aztec language. One translation of the name connects the Axolotl to Xolotl. The most common translation is "water-dog" . "Atl" for water and "Xolotl" for dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= axolotl.org

 |title= Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Aztec calendar, the ruler of the day, Itzcuintli ("Dog"), is [[Mictlantecuhtli]], the god of death and lord of Mictlan, the afterlife.&lt;ref name=azteccalendar&gt;{{cite web|title=Mictlantecuhtli|url=http://www.azteccalendar.com/god/Mictlantecuhtli.html|website=azteccalendar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
[[File:Xolotl, Codex Borgia page 38.jpg|thumb|left|[[Codex Borgia]] (p. 38) Xolotl with [[Xiuhcoatl]] "Fire Serpent"]]
Xolotl is sometimes depicted carrying a torch in the surviving [[Maya codices]], which reference the Maya tradition that the dog brought fire to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Neumann 1975 p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mayan codices, the dog is conspicuously associated with the god of death, storm, and lightning.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 1994 p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Xolotl appears to have affinities with the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] lightning-dog, and may represent the lightning which descends from the [[thundercloud]], the flash, the reflection of which arouses in many primitive people the belief that lightning is "double", and leads them to suppose a connection between lightning and twins.&lt;ref name="Spence 2015 p. 276"&gt;Spence 2015 p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Xolotl originated in the southern regions, and may represent fire rushing down from the heavens or light flaming up in the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Seler 2010 p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Xolotl was originally the name for lightning beast of the Maya tribe, often taking the form of a dog.&lt;ref name="Seler 2010 p. 94"/&gt; The dog plays an important role in Maya manuscripts. He is the lightning beast, who darts from heaven with a torch in his hand.&lt;ref&gt;Seler 2010 p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Xolotl is represented directly as a dog, and is distinguished as the deity of air and of the four directions of the wind by Quetzalcoatl's breast ornament. Xolotl is to be considered equivalent to the beast darting from heaven of the Maya manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Seler 2010 p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The dog is the animal of the dead and therefore of the Place of Shadows.&lt;ref name="Spence 2015 p. 276"/&gt;

== Ollin and Xolotl ==
[[File:Xolotl_head.JPG#/media/File:Xolotl_head.JPG|thumb|left|Stone sculpture representing the head of the Aztec god Xolotl. "''An important figure within the rituals surrounding the god Quetzalcoatl is Xolotl, his twin, a peculiar god in the form of a dog, identifiable by the many wrinkles on the sacred canine and the two rectangular protuberances on its head, relating it with the heavenly fire.''"]]
[[File:Codex Borgia p. 10 (Ollin) Day symbol.jpg|thumb|Day symbol Ollin in Codex Borgia (p.10)]]
[[Eduard Seler]] associates Xolotl's portrayal as a dog with the belief that dogs accompany the souls of the dead to Mictlan. He finds further evidence of the association between Xolotl, dogs, death, and Mictlan in the fact that Mesoamericans viewed twins as unnatural monstrosities and consequently commonly killed one of the two twins shortly after birth. Seler speculates that Xolotl represents the murdered twin who dwells in the darkness of Mictlan, while Quetzalcoatl ("The Precious Twin") represents the surviving twin who dwells in the [[light]] of the sun.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In manuscripts the setting sun, devoured by the earth, is opposite Xolotl's image.&lt;ref&gt;Seler 2010 p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Quetzalcoatl and Xolotl constitute the twin phases of Venus as the morning and evening star, respectively. Quetzalcoatl as the morning star acts as the harbinger of the Sun's rising (rebirth) every [[dawn]], Xolotl as the evening star acts as the harbinger of the Sun's setting (death) every [[dusk]]. In this way they divide the single life-death process of cyclical transformation into its two phases: one leading from birth to death, the other from death to birth.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Maffie, James   |title=Aztec Philosophy: Understanding a World in Motion |publisher=University Press of Colorado |year=2013|isbn=1-45718-426-5}}
Olin and Xolotl&lt;/ref&gt;

Xolotl was the patron of the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]]. Some scholars argue the ballgame symbolizes the Sun's perilous and uncertain nighttime journey through the underworld.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Xolotl is able to help in the Sun's rebirth since he possesses the power to enter and exit the underworld.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In several of the manuscripts Xolotl is depicted striving at this game against other gods. For example, in the [[Codex Mendoza]] we see him playing with the moon-god, and can recognize him by the sign ollin which accompanies him, and by the gouged-out eye in which that symbol ends. Seler thinks "that the root of the name ollin suggested to Mexicans the motion of the rubber ball ''olli'' and, as a consequence, ball-playing."&lt;ref&gt;Spence 2015 p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

Ollin is pulsating, [[oscillating]], and centering motion-change. It is typified by [[bouncing ball]]s, pulsating hearts, labor contractions, [[earthquakes]], flapping butterfly wings, the undulating motion of weft activities in [[weaving]], and the oscillating path of the Fifth Sun over and under the surface of the earth. Ollin is the motion-change of cyclical completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= mexicolore.co.uk

 |title= Aztec Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A jade statue of a skeletal Xolotl carrying a solar disc bearing an image of the Sun on his back&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Latinamericastudies.org
 |url= http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/aztecs/skeletonized-deity.gif
 |title= Skeletonized deity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Gettyimages.com
 |url= http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/statue-of-xolotl-rear-view-artefact-from-mexico-aztec-stock-graphic/148357417
 |title= Statue of Xolotl,  rear view }}&lt;/ref&gt; (called "the Night Traveler") succinctly portrays Xolotl's role in assisting the Sun through the process of death, gestation, and rebirth. Xolotl's association with ollin motion-change suggests proper completions and gestations must instantiate ollin motion-change. Ollin-shaped decomposition and integration (i.e., death) promote ollin-shaped composition and integration (i.e., rebirth and renewal).&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Nanahuatzin and Xolotl ==
[[File:Red Xolotl, Codex Borgia page 34.jpg|thumb|left|[[Codex Borgia]] (p. 34) Xolotl sacrifices the rain god. Within the sanctuary of the Red Temple, the Sun is finally born. Against the background of a solid red disk, a warrior drills a fire on the chest of a figure lying down. From the smoke emerges a red solar deity with the wind jewel. Immediately to the right, the deity is enthroned in the temple. He now has canine claws, a canine mouth mask, the wind jewel, and a distended eye that identify him as the red Xolotl, he also carries the Sun on his back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Boone, Elizabeth Hill   |title=Cycles of Time and Meaning in the Mexican Books of Fate
|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-292-75656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Codex Borgia page 47(Xolotl).jpg|thumb|Codex Borgia (p. 47) a dog Xolotl accompanies an anthropomorphic avatar of Xolotl.&lt;ref&gt;Milbrath 2013 p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A close relationship between Xolotl and [[Nanahuatzin]] exists.&lt;ref&gt;Boone 1985 p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Xolotl is probably identical with Nanahuatl (Nanahuatzin).&lt;ref&gt;Spence 1994 p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Eduard Seler|Seler]] characterizes Nanahuatzin ("Little Pustule Covered One"), who is deformed by [[syphilis]], as an aspect of Xolotl in his capacity as god of monsters, deforming diseases, and deformities.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The syphilitic god Nanahuatzin is an avatar of Xolotl.&lt;ref&gt;Sweely 1999 p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;
