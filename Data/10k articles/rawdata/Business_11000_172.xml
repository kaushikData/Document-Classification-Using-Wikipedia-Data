'''Aldo Gucci'''  (26 May 1905 – 19 January 1990) was the chairman of [[Gucci|Gucci Shops Inc.]] from 1953 to 1986.  He was the eldest son of [[Guccio Gucci]], who founded the company bearing his name in 1921.

== Early life ==
Aldo Gucci was born in Florence into a Tuscan family dating back to the thirteenth century in the nearby town of San Miniato.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EExuyvAOiNgC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=gucci+san+miniato#v=onepage&amp;q=gucci%20san%20miniato&amp;f=false | title = The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed | isbn = 9780062222671 | author1 = Forden | first1 = Sara G | date = 8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his formative years he developed an interest in equestrianism and botany, which would later find its outlet in product design and a passion for gardening.  At just sixteen he began part-time work in his father's first shop in via della Vigna Nuova in Florence.

== Career ==
From the age of 20, Aldo began work full-time at Gucci. He went on to open the first shop outside his native city in Rome in 1938&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gucci.com/ch/worldofgucci/articles/rome-flagship |title=via condotti store, rome |publisher=Gucci |date=2 September 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon after took over the reins of the company upon his father's death in 1953. Gucci became an overnight status symbol when the bamboo handbag was featured on Ingrid Bergman's arm in Roberto Rossellini's 1954 film "Viaggio in Italia".  The GG insignia became an instant favorite of Hollywood celebrities and European royalty.
When Aldo opened in New York in 1953, he planted the "Made in Italy" flag on American soil for the first time.  President John F Kennedy heralded him as the first Italian Ambassador to fashion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanmag.com/article_print.php?article=3042&amp;show_images=1 |title=The American &amp;#124; In Italia: At Large: History 102: Bloodied luxury |publisher=Theamericanmag.com |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was awarded an honorary degree by the City University of New York in recognition of his philanthropic activity, described as the Michelangelo of Merchandising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaiter |first=Dorothy J. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/03/nyregion/at-3-commencements-recognition-and-advice-209299.html |title=AT 3 COMMENCEMENTS, RECOGNITION AND ADVICE |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=3 June 1983 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He went on to open shops in Chicago, Palm Beach and Beverly Hills, before expanding to Tokyo, Hong Kong and in cities around the world through a global franchising network.  For over thirty years he was dedicated to the expansion of Gucci, developing the company into a vertically integrated business with its own tanneries, manufacturing and retail premises. In 1986 he was sentenced to one year and one day in prison for tax evasion in New York. He was 81.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engelberg |first=Stephen |url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/taxation/index.html?offset=750&amp;s=closest&amp;field=des&amp;match=exact&amp;query=TAX%20EVASION&amp; |title=Taxes – News – Times Topics – The New York Times – Narrowed by 'TAX EVASION' |publisher=Travel2.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did his time at the [[Federal Prison Camp, Eglin|Federal Prison Camp]] at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. In 1987, after 66 years as a family-owned business, Gucci was sold to [[Investcorp]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Investcorp]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldo Gucci died at the age of 84 of prostate cancer, in January 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/21/obituaries/aldo-gucci-84-expanded-fashion-house-in-us.html|title=Aldo Gucci, 84; Expanded Fashion House in U.S.|last=Reuters|date=1990|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family life ==
Aldo was the eldest of five children born to Guccio and Aida Calvelli Gucci. He had three brothers – Vasco, Rodolfo and Enzo (who died aged nine), and a sister – Grimalda.  He also had an adopted brother, Ugo, from his mother's previous relationship.  Aldo had three sons – Giorgio, Paolo and Roberto (with Olwen Price), and a daughter – Patricia (with Bruna Palombo, whom he married in Palm Springs, California in 1987), all of whom worked in the family business until its sale in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Everett |first=Victoria |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20083026,00.html |title=Move Over, Dallas; Behind the Glittering Facade, a Family Feud Rocks the House of Gucci |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrey V. Kirikov''' (born 29 September 1975 in [[Kemerovo]]) is a [[Russia]]n lawyer and entrepreneur. He was one of the founding shareholders of [[Sibcement|Sibir Cement Group]], a major Russian cement producer.

==Biography==
Born in Kemerovo in 1975 to a  mathematician and a medical doctor, Andrey graduated from the Law School of the [[Kemerovo State University]] in 1997. After graduation, Andrey Kirikov went to work full-time as a legal counsel at [[Kuzbassprombank]], which he had joined while still in law school.

In 1999, he became legal counsel to Deputy Governor for Construction of the [[Kemerovo Region]], moving up to Head of Legal Support for Deputy Governor for Revenue. He became Director for Legal and General Management at [[Novokuznetsk Iron and Steel Plant|Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Plant]] in 2000, subsequently becoming head of the private [[Регионсервис|Regionservice Bar Association]], an NPO.

He defended his PhD thesis on legal support for crime prevention at the [[Griboedov Institute for International Law and Economics]] in 2002, earning his PhD equivalent in law. His thesis was the first law research document in Russia to formulate the concept of legal support for crime prevention as an essential category of criminology and provide theoretical underpinnings for it. In the conclusion to his thesis, Andrey Kirikov noted the need for passing a basic law in this area – the federal law on prevention of crime.

Andrey Kirikov was a Director (member of the Board of Directors) at [[Sibcement|Sibir Cement Holding Company]] in 2004—2008, moving on to start an investment business of his own after that.

==Law practice and business activities==
While still in law school, Andrey Kirikov was hired by [[Kuzbassprombank]] as a legal counsel, a position he held until 1998. His experience of legal work in banking, government service, and in the steel industry led him to start a non-profit in 2001 – the private Bar Association Regionservice, which Kirikov led for eight years.

Andrey Kirikov became one of three founders, a core shareholder and Board Member of public joint-stock [[Sibcement|OAO Sibir Cement Holding Company]], a major Russian financial and industrial groups, in 2004. True to its name, the company focused on production and marketing of [[Portland cement]] in the vast Russian region of [[Siberia]]. Kirikov was one of the key people in the Sibir Cement Group until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1391910 «Сибцемент» теряет основателей]&lt;/ref&gt;

After resigning from Sibir Cement, together with its President and core shareholder [[Андрей Анатольевич Муравьёв|Andrey Muravyov]], Andrey Kirikov sold his 12% stake in the company. New management of Sibir Cement later sued Kirikov for more than RUB 70 million (approximately US$2.3 million at the time), claiming that Kirikov had failed to repay a loan he borrowed from the Group in 2007. The Russian media trace the roots of conflict between Sibir Cement and its former top managers to disagreements over a EUR 600-million deal to buy [[Set Group]], the Turkish division of [[Italcementi Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article/286511/starye_dolgi Старые долги]&lt;/ref&gt; The Moscow City Court dismissed SIbir Cement’s claims against Kirikov on January 24, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pravo.ru/news/view/81789/ Мосгорсуд оставил бывшему совладельцу «Сибцема» Кирикову 51,8 млн руб.: заем без договора — не заем]&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrey Kirikov has been a Director at Mercury Capital Trust, an asset management firm, since 2008.

==Family==
In the summer of 1995, Andrey married his elementary and high school classmate Alina Kaidorina, whom he had met in the second grade.

Andrey and Alina Kirikovs have two sons, Igor (b. 1999) and Demyan (b. 2007). Andrey Kirikov is an avid hunter, scuba diver, amateur boxer and alpine skier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3370">'''Arbora &amp; Ausonia''' was a company that dealt in the manufacturing and sale of absorbent products for the child and family hygiene, feminine hygiene and adult incontinence markets. It fully merged into [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] in 2013.

==History==
Arbora Holding (founded in 1968) and Ausonia (created in 1977) merged in 1998 to form Arbora &amp; Ausonia, a leading company in the Iberian [[personal care]] and [[hygiene]] sector market. In 1989 Arbora &amp; Ausiona became a joint venture between Procter &amp; Gamble, a consumer products multinational, and Agrolimen group, a Spanish holding company with international presence at the forefront of the food sector.&lt;ref&gt;EFE - [http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2012/07/19/actualidad/1342726412_346544.html P&amp;G compra el 50% de Arbora &amp; Ausonia a Agrolimen por 814 millones de euros]&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Arbora &amp; Ausonia traded in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], with offices in [[Barcelona]] (headquarters of the central offices) and in [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] ([[Lisbon]]). There were nearly 1,300 employees distributed throughout its offices and plants. The Arbora &amp; Ausonia plant in [[Jijona]], the industrial site with the highest number of employees in all the [[province of Alicante]], employed 500 people. The plant had also grown considerably from 2,600 square metres in the 80's, to an area of 59,500 square metres. Arbora &amp; Ausonia, had a further two plants in [[Mequinenza]] ([[Zaragoza (province)|Zaragoza]]) and Montornès del Vallès ([[Barcelona (province)|Barcelona]]).

On 2012 it was announced that Agrolimen would be seeling its 50% to Procter &amp; Gamble for $1 Billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters - [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-procter-agrolimen-idUSBRE86J0PS20120720 Procter buying rest of Agrolimen joint venture for $1 billion]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2013 Procter &amp; Gamble announced the absortion of the Arbora &amp; Ausonia company into Procter &amp; Gamble, closing their Barcelona headquarters but maintaining most of the remaining infrastructure. &lt;ref&gt;Expansión - [http://www.expansion.com/2013/01/16/catalunya/1358352764.html P&amp;G anuncia el cierre de la sede de Arbora &amp; Ausonia en Barcelona y su traslado a Madrid]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brands and products==
* Dodot, Kandoo and Charmin [[nappies]] and wipes
* Evax and Ausonia sanitary towels and panty liners
* Tampax [[tampon]]s
* Ausonia Evolution, Lindor and Salvacamas products for [[urinary incontinence]]

==Corporate social responsibility==
Through its brands Arbora &amp; Ausonia offered society useful information on health at different stages of people's lives, and worked with specialists and professionals in different fields on projects such as "La adolescencia y tú" (Adolescence and you), run on a joint basis with the Child and Adolescent Gynaecology Group, an initiative of the Spanish Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (SEGO), a society with which the Women's Intimate Health Observatory has been developed.

==Other agreements and campaigns==
* Dodot collaboration agreement with [[Unicef]]

[[File:Biohazard symbol (black and yellow).png|alt=A black symbol on a yellow background|thumb|The biohazard symbol]]'''Biological hazards''', also known as '''biohazards''', refer to [[biological]] substances that pose a threat to the health of [[living organisms]], primarily that of humans. This can include samples of a [[microorganism]], [[virus]] or [[toxin]] (from a biological source) that can affect human [[health]]. It can also include substances harmful to other animals.
[[File:Biohazard Symbol Specification.png|thumb|alt=The Biohazard Symbol with dimensions as defined in https://archive.org/stream/federalregister39kunit#page/n849/mode/1up]]

The term and [[Hazard symbol#Biohazard sign|its associated symbol]] are generally used as a warning, so that those potentially exposed to the substances will know to take precautions.  The biohazard symbol was developed in 1966 by Charles Baldwin, an environmental-health engineer working for the [[Dow Chemical Company]] on the containment products.&lt;ref name="waterloo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/History-of-Biohazard-Symbol.htm |title=Biohazard Symbol History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213165520/http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/biosafetyresources/history-of-biohazard-symbol.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used in the labeling of biological materials that carry a significant health risk, including viral samples and used [[hypodermic needles]].

In [[Unicode]], the [[biohazard symbol]] is U+2623 (&lt;span style="font-size: larger;"&gt;☣&lt;/span&gt;).

==Classification==
Bio hazardous agents are classified for transportation by [[UN number]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ocio.usda.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2012/DR9630-001_0.htm |title=USDA Policies and Procedures on Biohazardous Waste Decontamination, Management, and Quality Controls at Laboratories and Technical Facilities |publisher=USDA |author= |date= |accessdate=December 17, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305032934/https://www.ocio.usda.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2012/DR9630-001_0.htm |archivedate=March 5, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Category A, UN 2814 – Infectious substance, affecting humans: An infectious substance in a form capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposure to it occurs.
* Category A, UN 2900 – Infectious substance, affecting animals (only): An infectious substance that is not in a form generally capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans and animals when exposure to themselves occurs.
* Category B, UN 3373 – Biological substance transported for diagnostic or investigative purposes.
* Regulated Medical Waste, UN 3291 – Waste or reusable material derived from medical treatment of an animal or human, or from biomedical research, which includes the production and testing.

== Levels of biohazard ==
{{Main|Biosafety level}}
[[File:Sharps Container.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Immediate disposal of used needles into a [[sharps container]] is standard procedure.]]
[[File:Army trainers teach NHS medics how to put on Ebola safety suits (15650293350).jpg|thumb|200px|right|NHS medics practice using protective equipment used when treating [[Ebola]] patients]]

The United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) categorizes various diseases in levels of biohazard, Level 1 being minimum risk and Level 4 being extreme risk.  Laboratories and other facilities are categorized as BSL ([[Biosafety Level]]) 1–4 or as ''P1'' through ''P4'' for short (Pathogen or Protection Level).

* '''Biohazard Level 1:''' Bacteria and viruses including ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', [[Canidae|canine]] [[hepatitis]], ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', and [[varicella]] ([[chicken pox]]), as well as some cell cultures and non-infectious bacteria. At this level precautions against the biohazardous materials in question are minimal, most likely involving gloves and some sort of facial protection.
* '''Biohazard Level 2:''' Bacteria and viruses that cause only mild disease to humans, or are difficult to contract via [[aerosol]] in a lab setting, such as hepatitis [[hepatitis A|A]], [[hepatitis B|B]], and [[hepatitis C|C]], some [[influenza A]] strains, [[Lyme disease]], [[salmonella]], [[mumps]], [[measles]], [[scrapie]], [[dengue fever]], and [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]]. Routine diagnostic work with clinical specimens can be done safely at Biosafety Level 2, using Biosafety Level 2 practices and procedures. Research work (including co-cultivation, virus replication studies, or manipulations involving concentrated virus) can be done in a BSL-2 (P2) '''facility''', using BSL-3 practices and procedures.
* '''Biohazard Level 3:''' Bacteria and viruses that can cause severe to fatal disease in humans, but for which vaccines or other treatments exist, such as [[Anthrax disease|anthrax]], [[West Nile virus]], [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis]], [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS virus]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome|MERS coronavirus]], [[hantaviruses]], [[tuberculosis]], [[typhus]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], [[yellow fever]], and [[malaria]]. 
* '''Biohazard Level 4:''' Viruses that cause severe to fatal disease in humans, and for which vaccines or other treatments are ''not'' available, such as [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever]], [[Marburg virus]], [[Ebola virus]], [[Lassa fever virus]], [[Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever]], and other [[viral hemorrhagic fever|hemorrhagic]] diseases and rishibola.  [[Variola virus]] ([[smallpox]]) is an agent that is worked with at BSL-4 despite the existence of a vaccine, as it has been eradicated.  When dealing with biological hazards at this level the use of a [[positive pressure personnel suit]], with a segregated air supply, is mandatory. The entrance and exit of a Level Four biolab will contain multiple showers, a vacuum room, an [[ultraviolet]] light room, [[Autonomous Detection System|autonomous detection system]], and other safety precautions designed to destroy all traces of the biohazard. Multiple airlocks are employed and are electronically secured to prevent both doors opening at the same time. All air and water service going to and coming from a [[Biosafety level#Levels|Biosafety Level 4]] (P4) lab will undergo similar decontamination procedures to eliminate the possibility of an accidental release. Currently there are no bacteria classified at this level.

==Symbol==
{{Duplication|section=yes|dupe=Hazard symbol#Biohazard sign}}
The [[Hazard symbol#Biohazard sign|biohazard symbol]] was developed by the [[Dow Chemical Company]] in 1966 for their containment products.&lt;ref name="waterloo"/&gt; According to Charles Baldwin,&lt;ref name="waterloo"/&gt; an environmental-health engineer who contributed to its development: "We wanted something that was memorable but meaningless, so we could educate people as to what it means." In an article he wrote for ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iconglobe.net/blog/2011/01/07/biohazard-symbol-history/{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the symbol was presented as the new standard for all biological hazards ("biohazards"). The article explained that over 40 symbols were drawn up by Dow artists, and all of the symbols investigated had to meet a number of criteria:
# Striking in form in order to draw immediate attention;
# Unique and unambiguous, in order not to be confused with symbols used for other purposes;
# Quickly recognizable and easily recalled;
# Symmetrical, in order to appear identical from all angles of approach;
# Acceptable to groups of varying ethnic backgrounds.
The chosen symbol scored the best on nationwide testing for memorability.&lt;ref name=BiohazardScience&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=CL|author2=Runkle, RS|title=Biohazards symbol: development of a biological hazards warning signal|journal=Science|date=Oct 13, 1967|volume=158|issue=798|pages=264–5|doi=10.1126/science.158.3798.264|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/1967-10-13-Science-paper-Biohazard-Symbol.pdf|accessdate=29 August 2011|pmid=6053882|bibcode=1967Sci...158..264B|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928072239/http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/1967-10-13-Science-paper-Biohazard-Symbol.pdf|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design was first specified in [https://archive.org/stream/federalregister39kunit#page/n849/mode/1up 39 FR 23680] but was dropped in the succeeding amendment. However, various US states adopted the specification for their state code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lni.wa.gov/wisha/rules/corerules/html/296-800-110.htm WAC 296-800-11045] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210222735/http://www.lni.wa.gov/wisha/rules/corerules/html/296-800-110.htm |date=February 10, 2012 }}, see PDF for a high resolution graphic&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four circles within the symbol, signifying the chain of infection.
# Agent: The type of microorganism, that causes infection or hazardous condition.
# Host: The organism in which the microorganism Infect. The new host must be susceptible.
# Source: The host from which the microorganism originate. The carrier host might not show symptoms.
# Transmission: The means of transmission, mostly direct or indirect. Some routes of transmission include air, insect, direct contact and contaminated surfaces.

'''Certificate in Management Studies''' (CMS) also referred as Certificate in Management, Graduate Certificate in Management, Masters Entry Certificate in Management, is a UK undergraduate qualification normally comprising 3-4 modules of study in the area of [[Management]]. It forms the first half of [[Diploma]] in [[Management Studies]] (DMS).

==Pathway==
The CMS &amp; DMS form the pathway for many students going onto complete MBA's. Most of the institutions offering the CMS/DMS offer the [[MBA]] as the final stage or the credit for achieving the DMS can be transferred to another institution. The exams and coursework undertaken at this level serves as a foundation for similar assessment at the MBA level where there is a strong focus on research and written reports.

The '''chief commercial officer''' ('''CCO''') (sometime referred to as the [[Chief Business Officer]]) is an executive-level role, with the holder being responsible for the commercial strategy and the development of an [[organization]]. It typically involves activities relating to [[marketing]], [[sales]], [[product development]] and [[customer service]] to drive business growth and [[market share]]. As a corporate officer position, the CCO generally reports directly to the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) and is primarily concerned with ensuring the integrated commercial success of an organization. The role typically must combine technical knowledge of the relevant field with strong marketing and business development skills.

Essentially, a CCO takes ownership of the customer and the customer interface with the product or service offering, making sure that all functions of the organization are aligned to meet its strategic commercial objectives. This means that they are closely linked to the organization's [[strategic management]] function, in drafting, implementing and evaluating cross-functional decisions that will enable an organization to achieve its long-term objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdcexec.com/web/online/Decision-Support-Trends/New-Power-Center-Seen-Emerging-in-C-level-Suite-with-Rise-of-Chief-Commercial-Officer/16$11506|date=July 2009|work=Supply &amp; Demand Chain|title=New Power Center Seen Emerging in C-level Suite with Rise of Chief Commercial Officer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a company such as [[Amazon.com]], the CCO is at the same time the vice-president. This shows the importance that the new economy gives to customer's advice, which then influences services and products through social medias.

'''Clarita Crisostomo Dela Fuente-De Guzman''' (born December 28, 1958), better known as '''Claire de la Fuente''', is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] singer who achieved celebrity status in the late 1970s with the jukebox hit "Sayang". She was given the title "Asia's Sweetest Voice" because of her sweet voice. She was dubbed "the [[Karen Carpenter]] of the Philippines" as her voice has a striking resemblance to that of the late singer. Her first album in 1977 was then the [[Philippines]]' biggest ever seller. She went on to record seven more albums. Besides "Sayang", she is also known for hits like "Minsan-Minsan" and "Nakaw Na Pag-ibig".

She was given the title "Queen of Tagalog Songs" alongside [[Rico J. Puno]] as her counterpart. She was also named "Jukebox Queen" together with her contemporaries [[Imelda Papin]], Eva Eugenio and the late [[Didith Reyes]], and was also dubbed as "Asia's Sweetest Voice".

She is also a successful businesswoman. She is the president of the Integrated Metropolitan Bus Operators Association (IMBOA), though her bus franchise was cancelled in 2011 for joining a nationwide transport strike.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Biography==
{{BLP sources section|date=November 2012}}
De la Fuente was 15 when she won the grand prize in the first singing contest she joined, singing [[The Carpenters]]' "Love Me for What I Am". By that time, the Accounting freshman at the [[University of the East]] knew she loved singing and was aware that she sounded like Karen Carpenter after a high school classmate had pointed it out.

Composer [[George Canseco]], a fellow UE Alumni, and the head judge in the contest, gave the singer her first break by having her sing the jingle in a [[Hope (cigarette)|Hope]] cigarette commercial that became popular for its "imported" sound.

De la Fuente left show business in her mid-20s after reaping its financial rewards. She was married by that time, having tied the knot at 19 to a man 10 years her senior. In 1993, she set up the King of Kings Transport, which had to fold up a few years later. It wasn't the lucrative business she had hoped it would be.

Six years later, de la Fuente was elected president of the Integrated Metro Bus Operators Association (IMBOA), whose members make up 70 percent of all bus operators in [[Metro Manila]]. In 2003, de la Fuente made headlines when she spearheaded a boycott of the color-coding scheme that the MMDA had imposed for a week on all public utility vehicles as part of a traffic experiment. The move put her at odds with the equally headstrong [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority|MMDA]] Chairman [[Bayani Fernando]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inq7.net/globalnation/sec_sho/2003/may/26-04.htm From songbird to transport leader]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, de la Fuente went back to school to study transportation management at PUP then went ahead and finished a Masters in Business Administration at the University of Western Australia in 2005.

Besides being the spokesperson of the entire Public Transportation industry, she has become a very successful businesswoman. She dabbled into the cosmetics industry, opening up The Skin Shop. Alongside this, she showcased her flair for culinary arts and opened Gracielo's and Claire de la Fuente Seafood and Grill.

In December 2006, her husband and best friend for more than 28 years, Moises (Boy) de Guzman, died after a five-month struggle with cancer. He left behind de la Fuente together with their two sons, Gregorio (Gigo) and Gracielo (Mickey).

In 2008, she teamed up with [[Richard Carpenter (musician)|Richard Carpenter]] for her international album ''Something In Your Eyes''.

In 2010, she recorded a duet with [[Michael Bolton]], "The Christmas Song". The duet was included on her ''The Christmas Album'' under Viva Records.

'''Daniel Craig McCallum''' (21 January 1815 – 27 December 1878) was a Scottish-born American [[railroad engineer]], [[Management|general manager]] of the [[New York and Erie Railroad]] and Union [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Major General]] during the [[American Civil War]], known as one of the early pioneers of management. He set down a set of general principles of management,&lt;ref&gt;John E. Clark, John Elwood Clark (2004) ''Railroads in the Civil War: The Impact of Management on Victory and Defeat.''. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and is credited for having developed the first modern [[organizational chart]].&lt;ref name="ADC 1977"&gt;[[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] (1977) ''[[The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business]]''. p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
McCallum was born in [[Johnstone]] in the council area of [[Renfrewshire]] in the west central Lowlands of [[Scotland]] in 1815. In 1822 his family emigrated to New York, when he was still a boy. They settled in [[Rochester, New York]], where he spent a few years at elementary school. He didn't want to follow his father's footsteps to become a tailor. Instead he left school to become a [[carpenter]] and worked his way up.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel A. Wren (2005). ''The history of management thought''. Wiley, 2005. p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 1840s McCallum worked as an engineer in Rochester, where among other buildings he designed the [[St. Joseph's Church and Rectory (Rochester, New York)|Saint Joseph's Church]]. By the 1840s he started building and maintaining railway bridges as subcontractor for the [[New York and Erie Railroad]].&lt;ref name="renfrewshire 2014"&gt;[http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/webcontent/home/services/leisure+and+culture/heritage+and+local+history/els-jh-emigration-danielcraigmccallum Renfrewshire's emigrants: Daniel Craig McCallum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218181302/http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/webcontent/home/services/leisure+and+culture/heritage+and+local+history/els-jh-emigration-danielcraigmccallum |date=2014-02-18 }} at renfrewshire.gov.uk. Accessed January 31, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Late 1840s McCallum became in charge of the bridges of the New York and Erie railroad,&lt;ref name="ARJ 1852"&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=7203AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA385 McCallum's Patent Timber Bridge]" in: ''American Railroad Journal''. Saturday June 19, 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; where he started experimenting with new construction methods. He developed and in 1851 patented a new type of bridge, named the "McCallum Inflexible Arched Truss Bridge". Which could withstand heavier loads&lt;ref name="renfrewshire 2014"/&gt; and required less maintenance than previous designs. One bridge was built at [[Lanesboro, Pennsylvania]] over the [[Susquehanna River]], which enduring construction drew national attention.&lt;ref name="ARJ 1852"/&gt;

Early 1850s at the New York and Erie Railroad Company McCallum was promoted to superintendent of the Susquehanna Division,&lt;ref name="renfrewshire 2014"/&gt; one of five operating divisions of the railroad.&lt;ref name="ADC 1977"/&gt; And about two years later in 1854/54 he was further promoted to General Superintendent of the [[New York and Erie Railroad]] as successor of [[Charles Minot (railroad executive)|Charles Minot]] under [[Homer Ramsdell]]'s presidency. In this position he supervised the entire railroad and restructured the organization to make it more efficient and safe. He introduced new management and communication methods using the [[Telegraphy#Commercial Telegraphy|telegraph]]. He also described these new principles of management, and introduced the first modern [[organizational chart]]&lt;ref name="ADC 1977"/&gt; as a way to manage business operations.&lt;ref name="The Cases of Daniel McCallum and Gustavus Swift"&gt;[http://www.willamette.edu/~fthompso/MgmtCon/McCallum.htm The cases of Daniel McCallum and Gustavus Swift]&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February 1857&lt;ref&gt;Roger Pickenpaugh (1998) ''Rescue by Rail: Troop Transfer and the Civil War in the West, 1863.'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; McCallum resigned from the Erie Railroad and founded the McCallum Bridge Company in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;John D Wright (2012) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=LQnFbRC_bRQC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;dq McCallum, Daniel: Union general and military road director]" in: ''The Routledge Encyclopedia of Civil War Era Biographies''. p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]] the Secretary of War [[Edwin M. Stanton]] appointed McCallum Military Director and Superintendent of the [[United States Military Railroad]] with the staff rank of colonel. He was brevetted brigadier-general of volunteers for faithful and meritorious services in 1864, and to major general in 1865. In July 1866 he was mustered out of the service, and published a report on the military railroads during the war.

MacCallum also wrote a set of poems.&lt;ref name="Google Books"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=CN3Cip2aZzkC&amp;dq THE WATER - MILL; AND OTHER POEMS] By D. C. McCALLUM. 1871&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous was called 'Lights on the Bridge', which he wrote shortly before his death for his friend, Sam Campbell, who was a fellow railroad engineer killed in 1842. McCallum himself died in Brooklyn, New York, 27 December 1878.

=== Architecture, 1830s-40s ===
[[File:St Josephs Park.jpg|thumb|St. Joseph's Church facade.]]
McCallum was an architect in Rochester from 1840, and for a few subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;The 1847 ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=N5ZQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA157 Daily American Directory of the City of Rochester]'' (p. 157) still listed McCallum als architect holding office in Minerva Building.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an accomplished architect and held a high position in his profession.&lt;ref name="WHM 1877"&gt;W. H. McIntosh (1877) ''[https://archive.org/stream/historyofmonroec00mcin#page/n346/mode/1up History of Monroe County, New York: With Illustrations]''. p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Among the prominent buildings erected by him are the House of Refuge, [[St. Joseph's Church and Rectory (Rochester, New York)|St. Josephs Church]], St. Marys Hospital, and the Odd-Fellows' Hall building. He did much to improve the general architecture of the city. His drawings and studies were carefully made, and his plans well-adapted to location.&lt;ref name="WHM 1877"/&gt;

The St. Josephs Church was originally built 1843-1846 in the simple monumental tradition of the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]], with a gray stone facade of series of arched bays on the exterior facade. The simple church was enlarged 1849 into cruciform plan that sat a thousand. The interior was remodeled in 1895. The first steeple added in 1859 and replaced with a tower in 1909, designed by Joseph Oberlies.&lt;ref name=HP&gt;Mary Johna Grzeskowiak, ''The Adaptive Use of Religious Structures, Rochester, New York: A Case Study'' (MSc [[Historic Preservation]], [[Columbia University]], 1986), p.83-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sympathetic&gt;J. Russiello, ''A Sympathetic Planning Hierarchy for Redundant Churches: A Comparison of Continued Use and Reuse in Denmark, England and the United States of America'' (MSc Conservation of Historic Buildings, University of Bath, 2008), p.370.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays only the preserved facade of St. Joseph's Church has remained.

=== McCallum's Patent Timber Bridge, 1840s-60s ===
Late 1840s McCallum developed a specific [[truss bridge]] construction for the railroad bridges, called McCallum inflexible arched truss. It was constructed principally of pine timber, with less than the ordinary portion of iron rods, blots and casings.&lt;ref name="ARJ 1852"/&gt; An editorial notice from Appletons' Mechanics' Magazine, edited by [[Julius W. Adams]] commented on McCullam's Patent Timber Bridge, built in 1851 over the Susquehanna River, near Lanesboro', Pennsylvania, for the New York and Erie railroad.

:''We have no hesitation in affirming, that of all the timber bridges patented in this country, there are none, in point of strength, economy (in which we include ultimate durability), facility of repair, and uniformity of action, to be preferred before this plan of bridge lately patented by Mr. D. C. McCallum, of Oswego, engineer or ways and structures on the New York and Erie railroad.&lt;br&gt;[[File:McCullam's Patent Timber Bridge,1852.jpg|thumb|280px|Lithographic drawing of McCullam's Patent Timber Bridge, 1852]]The bridge shown in elevation (see image) has been built lately for the New York and Erie railroad, at Lanesboro', over the Susquehanna river, in the place of one built by ourselves, several years since, under the orders, and according to the plan of the chief engineer of that road, but which proved unequal to the duty imposed upon it; and its removal became a matter of necessity.&lt;br&gt;We objected to the plan of the original bridge, built in that locality, as we have ever done to any plan of bridge in which the attempt was made to unite the independent systems of arch and truss, and make toe stability of the bridge dependent upon their uniformity of action. In this plan of Mr. McCallum, the two principles are not independent as heretofore; but the action of the arch in the upper chord is made an integral part of the truss itself; and instead of two systems acting unequally, and to the ultimate injury of the structure, we have the best features of both united in a manner which admits of entire uniformity of action.&lt;br&gt;In the construction of bridges for railroad purposes, two prominent difficulties have long been discovered, viz., a lack of sustaining principle towards the ends of the trusses and near the abutments, and an entire absence in many cases of a proper counteracting principle to prevent vertical vibration by a moving load. See Haupt on Bridges, to which admirable work the reader is particularly referred for a full description of the proper office of a counter-brace...''&lt;ref name="ARJ 1852"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Appletons' Mechanics' Magazine and Engineers' Journal no 4 - Vol II April 1, 1852 p. 1 ([http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89049586563;view=1up;seq=91 online])&lt;/ref&gt;

These inflexible arched truss were used in wooden railroad bridges across the US and Canada in the 19th century.  After his work at the New York and Erie Railroad, in 1858 McCallum founded the McCallum Bridge Company in Cincinnati. The company specialized in railroad bridges, which they build in the Western and Southern States.&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Boone, Theodore Pease Cook (1870) ''Life Sketches of Executive Officers and Members of the Legislature of the State of New York, Volume 3''. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the [[Truss bridge#Howe truss|Howe truss]] men were so impressed by McCallum's business success (if not by his arguments) that they began arching their top chords, and a notable example of this practice was the Rock Island Bridge over the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;''Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers'', Vol. 26 ''The Society'', 1892. p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of steel bridges in the 1860s effectively made obsolete his unique design.

=== Large-scale management problems at New York &amp; Erie Railroad, 1850s ===
[[Image:1855 Erie.jpg|thumb|320px|New York &amp; Erie Railroad system map, circa 1855]]
McCallum had started at the New York &amp; Erie Railroad as subcontractor to build and maintain bridges, was appointed superintendent of one region and eventually made it General superintendent in 1855, controlling over 5000 employees. In this position McCallum came in contact with the large-scale management problems, which other great railroad companies such as the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR), the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] also faced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Chandler, Alfred D., Jr.]] "The Railroads: Pioneers in Modern Corporate Management". ''Business History Review'' 1965 39(1): 16-40. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3112463  in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main problems of these largests railroad companies was the rising of costs of moving freight in compare to smaller companies. McCallum postulated that this was caused by inefficient internal organization. In his 1856 report to the [[stockholder]]s of the [[New York &amp; Erie Railroad]] he explained:

:''A superintendent of a road fifty miles in length can give its business his professional attention and may be constantly on the line engaged in the direction of its details; each person is personally known to him, and all questions in relation to its business are at once presented and acted upon; and any system however imperfect may under such circumstances prove comparatively successful.   &lt;br&gt; In the government of a five hundred miles in length a very different state exists. Any system which might be applicable to the business and extent of a short road would be found entirely inadequate to the wants of a long one. and I am fully convinced that in the want of system perfect in its details, properly adapted and vigilantly enforced, lies the true secret of their [the large roads’] failure; and that this disparity of cost per mile in operating long and short roads, is not produced by a difference in length, but is in proportion to the perfection of the system adopted.''&lt;ref&gt;McCallum (1856: p. 34): Cited in: [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] (1962). ''Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the Industrial Enterprise''. p. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt;

New methods had to be invented for mobilizing, controlling, and apportioning capital, for operating a widely dispersed system, and for supervising thousands of specialized workmen spread over hundreds of miles. The railroads solved all these problems and became the model for all large businesses. The main innovators were three engineers, [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe, II|Benjamin H. Latrobe]] of the Baltimore and Ohio, McCallum of the Erie, and [[John Edgar Thomson]] of the Pennsylvania. They devised the functional departments and first defined the lines of authority, responsibility, and communication with the concomitant separation of line and staff duties which have remained the principles of the modern American corporation.

=== Illustrative organization chart, 1855 ===
[[File:Organizational diagram of the New York and Erie Railroad, 1855.jpg|thumb|Organizational diagram of the New York and Erie Railroad, 1855]]
As general superintendent McCallum in 1855 designed an illustrative organization chart of the New York and Erie Railway, which is considered to be the first modern [[organization chart]],&lt;ref name="CR 2012"&gt;Caitlin Rosenthal (2012) "[http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/big_data_in_the_age_of_the_telegraph Big data in the age of the telegraph]" in McKinsey Quarterly, March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; which was compiled and draw by the civil engineer [[George Holt Henshaw]]. On the chart is written,&lt;ref name="M&amp;H 1855"&gt;McCullum &amp; Henshaw "Plan of Organization New York and Erie Railroad," September 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; that the diagram represents a plan of organization, and exhibits the division of administrative duties and shows the number and class of employees engaged in each department, and is dated September 1855.

The chart explains that the diagram is compiled from the latest monthly report and indicates about the average number of employees of each class engaged in the Operating Department of the railroad company. It shows the powers and duties of each individual and to whom they are subject to report.&lt;ref name="M&amp;H 1855"/&gt; It further describes:

:''By inspection it will be seen that the Board of Directors as the fountain of power, concentrates their authority in the President as the executive Officer, who in that capacity directly controls those officers who are shown on the Diagram at the termini of the lines diverging from him, and these in their turn, though all the various ramifications down to the lowest employee control those who terminate the lines from them.&lt;br&gt;All orders from the Superior officers are communicated in the above order, from superior to subordinate to the point of desired; thereby securing despatch in their execution and maintaining proper discipline without weakening the authority of the immediate superior of the subordinate controlled by the order thus transmitted. Each individual therefore holds himself responsible only to his immediate superior..."&lt;ref name="M&amp;H 1855"/&gt;

Furthermore, a table is added showing the number of offices and employees classed. First were listed the employees in the five divisions of the New York &amp;  Erie Railroad divided in workers at the station, on trains, on repairs of trucks, and on repairs of bridges and buildings.&lt;ref name="M&amp;H 1855"/&gt;

The chart was thought lost for years, and only located at the Library of Congress after many years of research after [[Alfred D. Chandler Jr.|Alfred Chandler]] had suggested its existence. It was found by [[Charles D. Wrege]] (1924-2014)&lt;ref&gt;[http://aom.org/Networking/Charles-D--Wrege-Obituary.aspx Charles D. Wrege Obituary], 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and Guidon Sorbo Jr. (1927-2008) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Wrege and Guidon Sorbo, Jr., "A Bridge Builder Changes a Railroad: The Story of Daniel Craig McCallum," ''Canal History and Technology Proceedings'' 24 (March 2005): 183-218.&lt;/ref&gt; They suggested that the visualization of the organizational tree probably was inspired by the shape of a local flower [[Salix caprea]] (goat willow, also known as the pussy willow, or great sallow).&lt;ref name="AJC 2012"&gt;Albert J. Churella (2012) ''The Pennsylvania Railroad, Volume 1: Building an Empire, 1846-1917''. p. 842S&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principles of management, 1856 ===
As General Superintendent of the New York and Erie Railroad, McCallum developed new ideas about a modern system of management. In his 1856 report he formulated the following requirements:&lt;ref&gt;McCallum (1856, p. 35), cited in Vose (1857, p. 415)&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Organization scheme by D.C. McCallum, 1856.jpg|thumb|Organization scheme as pictured by McCallum, 1856]]
[[File:Organization scheme of railroad company, 1857.jpg|thumb|Table shows the rate and direction of subordination for a first class railroad, from [[George L. Vose|Vose]] (1857).]]
:''A system of operations to be efficient and successful should be such as to give to the principal and responsible head of the running department a complete daily history of details in all their minutiae. Without such supervision the procurement of a satisfactory annual statement must be regarded as extremely problematical. The fact that dividends are made without such control does not disprove the position, as in many cases the extraordinarily remunerative nature of an enterprise may insure satisfactory returns under the most loose and inefficient management.''
McCallum presented the following general principles for the formation of such an efficient system of operations,&lt;ref name="DCM 1856"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4Gc9AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA33 Report of the Superintendent of the New York and Erie Railroad to the Stockholders, for the Year Ending September 30]" by Daniel McCallum in: ''Annual Report''. New York and Erie Railroad Company, 1856. p. 33-97&lt;/ref&gt; reprinted in Vose (1857)&lt;ref name="GLV 1857"&gt;[[George Leonard Vose]]. ''Handbook of Railroad Construction: For the Use of American Engineers. Containing the Necessary Rules, Tables, and Formulæ for the Location, Construction, Equipment, and Management of Railroads, as Built in the United States.'' J. Munroe, 1857. p. 415-16&lt;/ref&gt; 
:*''First. A proper division of responsibilities.''
:*''Second. Sufficient power conferred to enable the same to be fully carried out, that such responsibilities may be real in their character.''
:*''Third. The means of knowing whether such responsibilities are faithfully executed.''
:*''Fourth. Great promptness in the report of all derelictions of duty, that evils may at once be corrected.''
:*''Fifth. Such information to be obtained through a system of daily reports and checks that will not embarrass principal officers nor lessen their influence with their subordinates.''
:*''Sixth. The adoption of a system, as a whole, which will not only enable the general superintendent to detect errors immediately, but will also point out the delinquent.''

About the core principle of management, he summarized:&lt;ref&gt;McCallum (1856, p. 59), cited in Vose (1857, p. 413)&lt;/ref&gt; 
:''All that is required to render tho efforts of railroad companies in every respect equal to that of individuals, is a rigid system of personal accountability through every grade of service.'' 
[[George L. Vose|Vose]] (1857, p.&amp;nbsp;416) added, that all subordinates should be accountable to, and directed by, their immediate superiors only. Each officer must have authority, with the approval of the general superintendent, to appoint all persons for whose acts he is held responsible, and to dismiss any subordinate when in his judgment the interests of the company demand it.&lt;ref name="GLV 1857"/&gt;

=== American Civil War, 1862-65 ===
[[File:Long Bridge, Washington, D.C - NARA - 528923.jpg|thumb|General Daniel Craig McCallum during the Civil War with unidentified men on the Long Bridge]]
In the American Civil War 11 February 1862, McCallum got appointed Military Director and Superintendent of the Union railroads, with the staff rank of colonel, by [[Edwin M. Stanton]], the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]]. McCallum had authority to "enter upon, take possession of, hold and use all railroads, engines, cars, locomotives, and equipment that may be required for the transport of troops, arms, ammunition, and military supplies of the United States, and to do and perform all acts... that may be necessary and proper... for the safe and speedy transport aforesaid," he wrote in his 1866 report.&lt;ref name= "DAP 2011"&gt;David A. Pfeiffer "[https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2011/summer/usmrr.html Working Magic with Cornstalks and Beanpoles: Records Relating to the U.S. Military Railroads during the Civil WarSummer]" in: ''Prologue'' 2011, Vol. 43, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; McCallum's view was that his organization "was a great construction and transportation machine, for carrying out the objects of the commanding generals." As superintendent of the New York and Erie Railroad McCallum had developed a reputation as an autocratic leader, running his railroad with "strict precision and stern discipline." But to his credit, he combined his engineering and administrative talents with his pleasant personality to make a success of his tenure.&lt;ref name= "DAP 2011"/&gt;

[[File:Daniel C. McCallum and Capt. Hurlbert on Lookout Mountain.jpg|thumb|McCallum and Capt. Hurlbert on [[Lookout Mountain]].]]
As McCallum's assistant was appointed [[Herman Haupt]], who also  was called to service in early 1862. The two worked practically independent from each other.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Frank Weigley (2000) ''A Great Civil War: A Military and Political History, 1861-1865.'' p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; While McCallum was the administrative head of the U.S. Military Railroads, Herman Haupt was in charge of the operations of the railroad in the field. At the time that McCallum assumed his duties, the seven-mile road from Washington to Alexandria, Virginia, was the only railroad in federal government control. By May 1862 the [[Orange and Alexandria Railroad]], which ran from Alexandria southwest toward Orange, Virginia, was an important supply line, as was the [[Manassas Gap Railroad]], which covered the territory between [[Manassas Junction]] and Front Royal and Strasburg.&lt;ref name= "DAP 2011"/&gt; By the end of the war, the U.S. Military Railroads had, at different times during the war, used parts of 17 railroads as military lines in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania and 23 in Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Arkansas, and North Carolina. In addition, the small Construction Corps grew from about 300 men in 1863 to nearly 10,000 men by the end of the war.&lt;ref name= "DAP 2011"/&gt;

During his stint as superintendent of the U.S. Military Railroads, McCallum fulfilled the function of liaison officer between the government and the many railroads on the one hand, and manufacturers of railroad equipment on the other. His greatest success was supporting the western operations from Nashville and Chattanooga under Gen. William T. Sherman in summer of 1864,&lt;ref name= "DAP 2011"/&gt; by successfully supplying [[General Sherman]]'s army of 100,000 men and 60,000 animals."&lt;ref name="renfrewshire 2014"/&gt; "The successful supply of Sherman's army in its campaign from Chattanooga to Atlanta was the most outstanding achievement of the military railroads," later reported Thomas Weber in ''The Northern Railroads in the Civil War, 1861–1865''.&lt;ref name= "DAP 2011"/&gt;

In 1865 McCallum participated in the organization of the [[Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln]]. Following his [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|death by assassination]], the body of [[Abraham Lincoln]] was brought from [[New Jersey Avenue Station|Washington, D.C.]] to its final resting place in Lincoln's hometown of [[Springfield, Illinois]], by [[funeral train]], accompanied by dignitaries. The [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] designated the route and declared railroads over which the remains passed as military roads under the control of McCallum as director and superintendent of [[United States Military Railroad]]s. No person was allowed to be transported on the cars except those authorized by the War Department, and the train never moved at speeds of more than {{convert|20|mi|km}} an hour to avoid any accidents.

To McCallum was due much of the efficiency of the railroad service during the civil war. He was brevetted brigadier-general of volunteers "for faithful and meritorious services," 24 Sept. 1864, and [[Major General]], 13 March 1865. On 31 July 1866, he was mustered out of the service. In the same year he published a report on the military railroads during the war, written with [[James Barnet Fry]].

== Reception ==

=== American timber bridges ===
The 1863 article entitled "American Timber Bridges" by the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] described that:
:''Timber-bridge building has become an especial branch of Engineering in the United States, and there are several firms who devote their whole time to this subject. The large number of bridges required for 30,000 miles of railway has necessarily given great field for experience, and many designs having been tried, the plan of bridge now the most general, becomes of course the more valuable. Of the firms alluded to, one of the most eminent is that of Mr. D. C. McCallum, an Engineer of high standing, who was for several years the manager of the New York and Erie Railway, a length of 460 miles, exclusive of branches. The Inflexible Arched Truss being now probably in more general use than any other bridge... The first mention [in Great Britain] of this bridge, and of Mr. McCallum's admirable system of working trains by the electric telegraph, will be found in Captain Galton's Report on the Railways of the United States.''&lt;ref&gt;Institution of Civil Engineers (Great Britain) (1863) "American Timber Bridges" in ''Minutes of Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers'' p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Percy covered bridge2009.jpg|thumb|280px|Percy covered bridge]] 
The National Cyclopedia of American Biography (1897) confirmed, that the inflexible arched truss introduced by McCallum has probably  been in more general use in the United States than any other system of timber bridges.&lt;ref&gt;J.T. White (1897) "McCallum, Daniel Craig" in ''The National Cyclopedia of American Biography''. p. 553&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 [[Historic American Engineering Record]] confirms that:
:''According to Raymond Wilson's article "Twenty Different Ways to Build a Covered Bridge," ''Technology Review'' May 1971, an estimated 150 McCallum truss bridges once existed. In 1858, there were 55 McCallum truss spans on the New York &amp; Erie Railroad and an advertisement for "McCallum's Inflexible Arch Truss" in [[Henry Varnum Poor|Poor]]'s 1860 "History of the Railroad and Canals of the United States", lists 20 railroad lines using this type of truss.''&lt;ref name="HAER No. NY-332"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/ny/ny2000/ny2012/data/ny2012data.pdf POWERSCOURT BRIDGE (Percy Bridge)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203100939/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/ny/ny2000/ny2012/data/ny2012data.pdf |date=2014-02-03 }} Historic American Engineering Record HAER No. NY-332. National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poor's 1860 "History of the Railroad and Canals of the United States" is published in: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=q08jAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq Railway Locomotives and Cars]'', Volume 33. (1860), for example see p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; 
This success didn't last much longer. McCallum continued to construct bridges during the Civil War, but the type of bridge fell out of favor. It was obsolete by 1870, because it was difficult to frame&lt;ref name="HAER No. NY-332"/&gt; and metal constructions had taken over.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer C. Tucker (2013) ''American Civil War: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection''. p. 1216&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays the only remaining example in the world of the McCallum truss is the [[Powerscourt Covered Bridge|Percy Covered Bridge (1861)]],&lt;ref name="Percy Covered Bridge"&gt;[http://powerscourt.tk Percy Covered Bridge, Powerscourt - Elgin - Hinchinbrooke Quebec&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ironically an automobile and [[footbridge]]. It crosses the [[Chateauguay River]] at Powerscourt, Québec, between the municipalities of [[Elgin, Quebec|Elgin]] and [[Hinchinbrooke, Quebec|Hinchinbrooke]].

=== Management principles ===
Chandler (1977) stipulated that:
:''McCallum's principles and procedures of management, like his organization chart, were new in American business. No earlier American businessman had ever had the need to develop ways to use internally generated data as instruments of management. None had shown a comparable concern for the theory and principles of organization. The writings of James Montgomery [a British textile manager with American experience] and the orders of plantation owners to their overseers talked about the control and discipline of workers, not the control, discipline, and evaluation of other managers. Nor does [[Sidney Pollard]] in his "Genesis of Modern Management" note any discussion about the nature of major principles of organization occurring in Great Britain before the 1830s, the data at which he stops his analysis.''&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Jr. (1977; p. 104-105)&lt;/ref&gt;

McCallum's work drew national and international attention. Chandler (1977) recalled that 
:''[[Henry Varnum Poor|Poor]] had McCallum's organization chart lithographed and offered copies for sale at $I a piece. [[Douglas Strutt Galton|Douglas Galton]], one of Britain's leading railroad experts, described McCallum's work in a parliamentary report printed in 1857. So too did the New York State Railroad Commissioners in their annual reports. Even the Atlantic Monthly carried an article in 1858 praising McCallum's ideas on railroad management.''&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Jr. (1977; p. 104)&lt;/ref&gt;

McCallum's ideas were further developed by others, such as Chandler (1956) explained: "expert railroad engineers as [[George L. Vose|George Vose]] and [[John B. Jervis]] wrote much on the principles of systematic management which McCallum had first articulated and [[Henry Varnum Poor|Poor]] had expanded upon."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Dupont Chandler (1956) ''Henry Varnum Poor, business editor, analyst, and reformer.'' p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Desnos Toussaint Yed (born 1 November 1968) is an [[Demographics of Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] businessman, art collector and [[philanthropist]] with interests in Properties, Mining and Agri-Business sectors.  He founded YEDCOR International&lt;ref name=Yedcor group=1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yedcor|first1=International|title=yEDCOR|url=http://www.yedcor.com/|website=Yedcor|publisher=Yedcor Site|accessdate=22 August 2015|ref=Yedcor}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999 and is currently the Chairman and CEO of the Conglomerate. Yed relocated [http://yedcor.com/ Yedcor] head offices from Ivory Coast to [[Johannesburg]] in [[South Africa]] after political instability in the Ivory Coast in 2000.

==Early life and education==
Yed was born in Becede, a small village in the southern [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] department of [[Sikensi Department|Sikensi]]. He was the third child in a family of five children born to Atenou Yed Andre and Adele Assa Yed. His father was a teacher and later became a professor. Yed displayed a strong entrepreneurial spirit from a very early age.

[http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAEAAAIhqogBzrmnTtPDw_k776gbs3Dx9Jrf8Uc&amp;authType=name&amp;authToken=v6DY&amp;trk=prof-proj-cc-name Yed] began his education in [[Abidjan]] and Daloa in west central [[Cote d’Ivoire]], where his father had been transferred for five years. At age of 14, Yed returned to Abidjan after a difficult stint in primary school.

In 1988 Yed graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from a French university. While as a student in [[France]], Yed was running a thriving games arcade and working as a waiter on the Côte d’Azur during the holidays. It was during this time Yed was inspired to become a philanthropist and earned the nickname [[sobriquet]].

== Business ==
After his studies, Yed moved back to Côte d'Ivoire in 1995 after a 10-year stint in France. He founded his first business Imtradex &amp; Partners in 1996, the company exporting tropical fruits to Europe. In 1996 Yed launched Yedcor International, a conglomerate comprising six companies, namely Yedcor Consulting, Yedcor Aviation, Geb&amp; Nut, Yedcor Construction, E-Gazaar and AfriGalleries.

== Personal life ==
Desnos is married to Elize Versie a former South African model. Yed met [https://www.linkedin.com/pub/elize-yed/6b/81a/a03 Elize Versie] in 1996 during a brief stop-over in Cairo on a business trip on his way to the Philippines. Desnos and Elize have three sons together.

== Real Estate Projects ==
In July 2015 Yedcor International announced its intention to build Yedcor Valley Center,&lt;ref name="Real Estate Project" group="Real Estate Project"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Agence|first1=Ecofin|title=Côte d’Ivoire: Yedcor International to launch big real estate project in Abidjan|url=http://www.agenceecofin.com/finance/0907-30536-cote-d-ivoire-yedcor-international-to-launch-big-real-estate-project-in-abidjan|accessdate=22 August 2015|work=Finance|agency=Agence Ecofin|issue=8 July 2015|publisher=Agence Ecofin|date=8 July 2015|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; a residential, trading and tourist real estate complex in Abidjan on an area covering 10 hectares.

The South African subsidiary of the US real estate group C [http://www.broll.com/cbre/ BRE Group], to construct a shopping center with an area of 27,000 square meters estimated to cost $100 million.This project, according to him, is to promote the destination Côte d'Ivoire and to make it a business hub, tourism and entertainment.

According to Desnos Yed, [http://www.lemagazinedumanager.com/10999-la-cote-divoire-projette-la-construction-dun-centre-daffaires-et-de-shopping-innovant.html Yedcor Valley Center], is also a Museum of Civilization planned to upgrade the Ivorian culture. This museum will tell the younger generation, through these parts, the story of people who have marked history by their inventions or political actions, cultural and social activities.

Yedcor valley is a city within the city, and intends to create that structure to the Riviera Golf on 10 hectares it has acquired. With 50,000 m2  of office space,  a concert center of 5,000 seats. The space for the construction will also accommodate six movie theatres, restaurants and entertainment centers.

== Vision for Africa ==
Desnos Yed believes&lt;ref name="Oil and Gas" group=Oil&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oil and Gas|first1=Financial Journals|title=A focus on South Africa|url=http://www.ogfj.com/articles/print/volume-3/issue-11/features/a-focus-on-south-africa.html|work=Oil and Gas Journal|agency=Focus Reports LLC|issue=2006|publisher=Focus Reports LLC|date=November 1, 2006|ref=Oil and Gas Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Africa’s reserves of natural resources are still vast and even after the colonization of Africa, which was aimed at exploiting Africa’s resources, Africa still holds the largest resources worldwide in many raw materials.  His strong belief is that when you know and respect the business culture of the African continent you can still be rich in Africa overnight, Africa has a lot of potential, and this century is the century of Africa.

== False Allegations ==
It is believed they have been some false and malicious allegations levelled against Desnos Toussaint Yed in some sections of the [http://www.jeuneafrique.com/mag/245632/economie/immobilier-le-curieux-projet-dun-mysterieux-promoteur-ivoirien/ media] with regards to the mega [http://www.agenceecofin.com/finance/0907-30536-cote-d-ivoire-yedcor-international-to-launch-big-real-estate-project-in-abidjan Yedcor Valley] Real Estate Project in Abidjan. The allegations are viewed by analyst as baseless with no concrete evidence or point of reference. Yed has been involved in successful construction projects before especially in South Africa.

'''Ebullated bed reactors''' are a type of [[fluidized bed reactor]] that utilizes ebullition, or bubbling, to achieve appropriate distribution of [[reagent|reactants]] and [[catalyst]]s. The ebullated-bed technology utilizes a three-phase reactor (liquid, vapor, and catalyst), and is most applicable for [[exothermic]] reactions and for feedstocks which are difficult to process in fixed-bed or [[plug flow reactor]]s due to high levels of contaminates. Ebullated bed reactors offer high-quality, continuous mixing of liquid and catalyst particles.The advantages of a good back-mixed bed include
excellent temperature control and, by reducing bed plugging and channeling, low and constant [[pressure drop]]s. Therefore, ebullated bed reactors have the characteristics of stirred reactor type operation with a fluidized catalyst.&lt;ref name=Kressman&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kressman, Et. al|title=Improvements of Ebullated-Bed Technology for Upgrading Heavy Oils|url=http://ogst.ifpenergiesnouvelles.fr/articles/ogst/pdf/2000/04/kressman_v55n4.pdf|website=Oil &amp; Gas Science Technology|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Advances in Chemical Engineering"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meurant|first1=Gerard|title=Advances in Chemical Engineering Volume 14|date=1989|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780080565613|pages=148–150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4FFPuRmkz0C&amp;dq=ebullated+bed+reactor&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==

The catalyst used for the ebullated bed is typically a 0.8-mm diameter extrudate, and is held in a fluidized state through the upward lift of liquid reactants and gas. The liquid and gas enter in the reactor [[plenum chamber|plenum]], and are distributed across the bed through a distributor and grid plate. The height of the ebullated catalyst bed can be controlled by the rate of liquid recycle flow. This liquid rate is adjusted by varying the speed of the ebullating pump, a canned [[centrifugal pump]] which controls the flow of ebullating liquid obtained from the internal vapor/liquid separator inside the reactor. Fresh catalyst can be added, and spent  catalyst withdrawn, to control the level of [[catalysis|catalyst activity]] within the reactor. The capability of regular addition of a small quantity of catalyst is instrumental to ebullated-bed reactors' consistent product quality over long time periods. To adjust operation and/or different feedstocks, the type of catalyst used can also be changed without shutting down the reactor.&lt;ref name=Kressman /&gt;&lt;ref name="Advances in Chemical Engineering" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CB&amp;I&gt;{{cite web|last1=CB&amp;I|title=LC-Fining|url=http://www.cbi.com/images/uploads/tech_sheets/LC-FINING-12.pdf|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100703/http://www.cbi.com/images/uploads/tech_sheets/LC-FINING-12.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''feminine style of management''' is a [[management style]] generally characterized by more feminine quality [[soft skills]] and behaviors such as empathy, effective communication, and a generally more democratic or team-styled work environment. The style is a growing trend within businesses and is characterized by a form of [[transformational leadership]] style. The feminine style of management, although characterized by traits commonly labeled as [[feminine]], it is not a style of management that is only used by females; it is also a style which has been found beneficial for particular types of businesses and organizations.

==Historical development==

===Early 1900s===
Beginning with textile mills and the shoe-making industry of post-revolutionary America, the first real appearance of an explosion of women in a general workforce, whether at home or manufacturing, came at the turn of the century. By [[World War I]], many women were poised to join the workforce as a high population of men served in the war. As men returned from the war and a falling economy led to the [[Great Depression]], women suffered displacement. By [[World War II]] there was a similar growth of women in business that had been previously reserved for men. The combination of a better economy and a quickly changing standard of society norms, many women's roles and functions in business steadily increased following World II.

===1970s–1980s===
In the 1970s feminist authors denied or minimized the differences between men and women to establish that women had similar talents to men and should have equal labor opportunities. In [[Schutlz v. Wheaton Glass Co]]., a U.S. Court of Appeals ruled jobs held by men must be "substantially equal" but not "identical" to fall under the protection of the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]] and that it is therefefore illegal for employers to change the job titles of women workers in order to pay them less than men.

However, as the 1980s began, differences were more emphasized and noted as a means of progression due the management style differences that came of feminine values and ways of behaving, feeling, and thinking.&lt;ref name="Management Style-British Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wajcman|first=Judy|title=Desperately Seeking Differences: Is management style gendered?|journal=British Journal of Industrial Relations|date=September 1996|volume=34|pages=333–349|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8543.1996.tb00478.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2011-10-15--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990–present===
In 1991, women represented 45% of all managerial positions.&lt;ref name="Business Encylopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Business|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/encyclopedia/Val-Z/Women-in-Business.html|work=Encyclopedia of Business|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, although the feminine management style can be found being utilized throughout organizations internationally now, barriers to acceptance of this management style include stereotype and perceptions, mentoring and networking availability, [[workplace discrimination]], family related issues, as well as funding availability.&lt;ref name="Organizational Textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Modaff|first=D.P|title=Organizational Communication: Foundations, challenges, and misunderstandings|year=2012|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|isbn=978-0-205-79825-4|pages=255–273|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rise in female leaders is a result of changing theories and practices of [[leadership]].

==Gendered organizations==
Reasons a systematic [[theory]] of gender and organizations is necessary:&lt;ref name="Gendered organizations Acker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acker|first=Joan|title=Hierarchies, Jobs, Bodies: A Theory of Gendered Organizations|journal=Gender and Society|date=June 1990|volume=4|pages=139–158|doi=10.1177/089124390004002002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The gender segregation of work, including divisions between paid and unpaid work, is partly created through organizational practices.
# Related to gender segregation, income and status inequality between women and men is also partly created in organizational processes; understanding these processes is necessary for understanding gender inequality.
# Organizations are one arena in which widely disseminated cultural images of gender are invented and reproduced. Knowledge of cultural productions is important for understanding gender construction.
# Some aspects of individual gender identity, perhaps particularly masculinity, are also products of organizational processes and pressures.
# An important feminist project is to make large-scale organizations more democratic and more supportive of humane goals.

===Gendering interaction processes===
In addition to the reasons that it is necessary to examine feminine styles of management within theories of gendered organizations, Acker adds, is because gendering occurs in at least five different interacting processes.&lt;ref name="Gendered organizations Acker" /&gt;

* First, the construction of divisions along lines of gender-[[division of labor]], of allowed behaviors, of locations in physical space, of power, including the institutionalized means of maintaining the divisions in the structures of labor markets, the family, the state.
* Second, the construction of [[symbols]] and images that explain, express, reinforce, or sometimes oppose those divisions.
* Third, interactions between women and men, women and women, men and men, including all those patterns that enact dominance and submission.
* Fourth, processes help to produce gendered components of individual [[Identity (social science)|identity]], which may include consciousness of the existence of the other three aspects of gender, such as, in organizations, choice of appropriate work, language use, clothing, and presentation of self as a gendered member of an organization.
* Finally, [[gender]] is implicated in the fundamental, ongoing processes of creating and conceptualizing social structures.

==Characteristics==

===Types of management===
Within the three main types of managerial styles, studies have examined differences in [[masculine]] and [[feminine]] styles. The first is the [[task management]] style, or how much a leader initiates, organizes, and/or defines work activities and processes. The second style,an [[interpersonal]] based style, which is a style where generally the leader builds morale, relationships, satisfaction, and commitment in the organization. Lastly, the third is the [[group decision making]] style, which is when the leader encourages a participative, democratic approach&lt;ref name="Business Encyclopedia" /&gt;

===Feminine style characteristics===
Some studies find differences between males' and females' task accomplishment styles and interpersonal styles. Males tended to be more task-oriented; females tended to be more relationship-oriented. These differences, however, have been observed only in men and women subjects of laboratory experiments, that is, people asked to speculate how they would behave if they were leaders. Management traditionally been male dominated and constructed in masculine terms. Present ideas involving femininity in management include transforming places of work into relation-oriented, flexible, and humane institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Due Billing|first=Yvonne|author2=Mats Alvesson| author-link= Mats Alvesson |title=Questioning the Notion of Feminine Leadership: A Critical Perspective on the Gender Labeling of Leadership|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|date=July 2000|volume=7|issue=3|pages=144–157|doi=10.1111/1468-0432.00103}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences disappear in studies where actual managers are compared: most conclude that women do not behave differently from men in the same or similar kind of leadership position. Moreover, experienced women managers show no differences in leadership abilities from experienced male managers. These women, in fact, are likely to more closely resemble their male counterparts in drive, skills, temperament, and competitiveness, than the average woman in the population.&lt;ref name="Business Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender and Leadership|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/encyclopedia/For-Gol/Gender-and-Leadership.html|work=Reference for Business Encyclopedia|accessdate=10/02/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Cummings stated, ""The notion of what makes an effective leader is changing, and you will find both [traditionally defined] ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’ components." &lt;ref name="knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu"&gt;http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-masculine-and-feminine-sides-of-leadership-and-culture-perception-vs-reality/&lt;/ref&gt; In order for women to make an impact within an organization as an executive they need to be aware of their leadership styles and strengths.&lt;ref name="knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu"/&gt;

==Examples==

===Examples in research===
In 1990, Alice Eagly and Johnson conducted a study on gender and leadership and found results they later emphasized with supporting meta-analysis data.&lt;ref name="Eagly 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=A|author2=Johnson, B.T.|title=Gender and leadership style: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1990|volume=108|pages=233–256|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.108.2.233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in 1992 and 1995, researchers Eagly and Johnson also conducted meta-analysis on the effectiveness and evaluation, respectively, of differing management styles. The results showed that the main difference in management styles in men and women were that women are more democratic, while men were found to generally be more autocratic, however, the studies show little evidence that would suggest males and females differ in their leadership effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Eagly 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=A |author2=Makhijani, M.G. |author3=Klonsky, B.G.|title=Gender and the effectiveness of leaders: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1992|volume=111|pages=3–22|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eagly 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=A|author2=Karau, S. J.|author3=Makhijani, M. G.|title=Gender and the effectiveness of leaders: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1995|volume=117|pages=125–145|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.1.125|pmid=7870858}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that women tend to be more focused on encouraging participation and involving their workforce in business decisions while men are more focused on encouraging performance and driving towards tangible production.

In 2003, a meta-analysis was conducted by Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, and Van Engen that compared male and female managers on measures of transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership styles; their findings emphasized the results of their previous study.The meta-analysis study showed that women were slightly more likely than men to exercise a transformational leadership style.&lt;ref name="Eagly, Johannesen, &amp; Van Engen 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=A |author2=Johannesen-Schmidt, M.C. |author3=Van Engen, M.|title=Transformational, transactional, and laissezfaire leadership styles: A meta-analysis comparing women and men.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2003|volume=108|pages=569–591|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.4.569 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a style of management that is likely to be used by coaches, teachers, and other individuals focused on developing subordinates. The transformational leadership encourages participation and creative problem solving. Eagly proposes that the transformational style of management is likely more advantageous for women to employ however. Men were shown to be more likely to critique their employees and be less interactive, in contrast to the women who utilized a more "hands-on" approach.

In contrast, research in the past few decades shows that these results are only averages. Men and Women do not show a significant difference in these management styles, only slight differences. Some men proved to use more feminine styles, while some women proved to use more masculine styles. Eagly states that,"the sex differences are small because the leader role itself carries a lot of weight in determining people's behavior.""

In 2005, a year-long study conducted by Caliper, a Princeton, New Jersey-based management consulting firm, and Aurora, a London-based organization that advances women, identified a number of characteristics that distinguish women leaders from men when it comes to qualities of leadership: Women leaders are more assertive and persuasive, have a stronger need to get things done and are more willing to take risks than male leaders....Women leaders were also found to be more empathetic and flexible, as well as stronger in interpersonal skills than their male counterparts....enabling them to read situations accurately and take information in from all sides....These women leaders are able to bring others around to their point of view....because they genuinely understand and care about where others are coming from....so that the people they are leading feel more understood, supported and valued.  These findings were summarized into four specific statements about women's leadership qualities: (1) Women leaders are more persuasive than their male counterparts, (2) When feeling the sting of rejection, women leaders learn from adversity and carry on with an "I'll show you" attitude, (3) Women leaders demonstrate an inclusive, team-building leadership style of problem solving and decision making, (4) Women leaders are more likely to ignore rules and take risks.&lt;ref name="Lowen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowen|first=Linda|title=Qualities of Women Leaders: The Unique Leadership Characteristics of Women|url=http://womensissues.about.com/od/intheworkplace/a/WomenLeaders.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=4/8/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BET's CEO, Debra Lee, explains that it is easy to generalize the differences in gender leadership styles as "women do it this way, and men do it that way."  Instead of simply generalizing, Debra Lee asserts that it is important to discuss these differences so that women don't feel uncomfortable managing differently from men.  During this interview she further states that we should encourage young women to climb the corporate ladder.  Lee explained that her hardest lesson was learning to follow her gut when others challenged it, but that lesson has truly paid off.  She insists that we encourage young women to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cunningham|first=Lillian|title=On women and Washington: A leadership interview with BET's Debra Lee|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/on-women-and-washington-a-leadership-interview-with-bets-debra-lee/2012/03/20/gIQAoo5GSS_story.html|accessdate=4/8/12|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=3/21/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's vital for women to embrace these differences. During a 2006 speech given by Dr. Musimbi Kanyoro, the World YWCA Secretary General, she explained that the attitudes toward leadership are changing and what women offer is essential.  She stated: "Domination as a leadership style is becoming less and less popular. There is a new growing appreciation of....those traits that women use to keep families together and to organize volunteers to unite and make change in the shared life of communities. These newly admired leadership qualities of shared leadership; nurturance and doing good for others are today not only sought after but also indeed needed to make a difference in the world....A feminine way of leading includes helping the world to understand and be principled about values that really matter."&lt;ref name="Lowen"/&gt;

===Recent examples in global society===
The feminine style of management embodying organizational progression, more and more female leaders are found within society today. In addition to the thousands of women who now receive graduate and doctoral degrees, many hold managerial positions within companies, and females hold 45% of all managerial posts.&lt;ref name="Sharpe Businessweek"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sharpe |first=Rochelle |title=As Leaders, Women Rule |url=http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_47/b3708145.htm |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=20 November 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128040043/http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_47/b3708145.htm |archivedate=2011-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, many nonprofit organizations take a feminine style of leadership approach when handling employees.  These particular organizations tend to encourage participation among group members, show flexibility, and maintain a non-hierarchical work environment.&lt;ref&gt;Questioning the notion of feminine leadership: a critical perspective on the gender labeling of leadership, Yvonne Due Billing &amp; Mats Alvesson, Gender, Work and Organization, 7(3), 2000, pp 144-157&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders that take on this style tend to show genuine care and understanding towards their employees. The empathy they have for others enables their employees to feel as though they are recognized and valued within the organization. These leaders are also known for their communication skills and tendency to listen to multiple perspective before making decisions.&lt;ref&gt;"Women Leaders Study: The Qualities That Distinguish Women Leaders." Caliperonline.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Their desire to use team-building activities creates a sense of community within organizations, which in turn helps to meet overall goals.&lt;ref&gt;Kanyoro, Musimbi. "Challenges to Women's Leadership." Speech in honor of YWCA of Salt Lake centennial celebration. 13 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a company using team-building, genuinely understand its employees needs, and embracing femininity is Mary Kay Cosmetics. This company strives to treat employees as individuals and help them reach their personal goals. When employees meet particular sales goals they are rewarded with things they desire, such as pink Cadillacs and diamonds. These actions show employees that they are valued and understood, which leads to a positive corporate culture.&lt;ref&gt;Knowledge@Wharton (2005). [http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1287 "The 'Masculine' and 'Feminine' Sides of Leadership and Culture: Perception vs. Reality."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sung-Joo Kim, chairman and chief executive of luxury-goods company MCM Worldwide, is an example of a woman using the feminine style of management to help successfully run a company.Kim's sensitivity and openness towards employees gives her an advantage over other luxury-good corporations. Kim has to find a balance between her sensitivity and still maintaining order and a level of toughness. Kim grew up in a patriarchal Korean household and her experiences led her to strive to prove to others that femininity and power are not mutually exclusive and it is quite possible to be a nurturing woman and still run a successful business.&lt;ref&gt;Covel, Simona. (2008). [https://blogs.wsj.com/independentstreet/2008/06/09/the-benefits-of-a-feminine-leadership-style/ "The Benefits of a 'Feminine' Leadership Style."]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Esther Wachs Book, "A new breed of leader is emerging, and that breed is female."  She contends that women, such as Meg Whitman of eBay and Marcy Carsey of Carsey-Werner, succeed because they embody seven uniquely female abilities: they can sell their visions; they are not afraid to reinvent the rules; they are focused on achievement; they show courage under fire; they turn challenges into opportunities; they are aware of customer preferences; and they maximize what Book calls "high touch" in an era of high tech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are women natural leaders, and men...the opposite?|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=265|publisher=Knowledge@Wharton|accessdate=4/8/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdinand Anton Ernst Porsche''' (19 September 1909&amp;nbsp;– 27 March 1998), mainly known as '''Ferry Porsche''', was an Austrian [[Design engineer|technical automobile designer]] and [[automaker]]-[[entrepreneur]]. He operated [[Porsche|Porsche AG]] in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]. His father, [[Ferdinand Porsche]], Sr. was also a renowned automobile engineer and founder of [[Volkswagen]] and Porsche. His nephew, Dr. [[Ferdinand Piëch]], is the longtime chairman of [[Volkswagen Group]], and his son, [[Ferdinand Alexander Porsche]], was involved in the design of the [[Porsche 911|911]].

Ferry Porsche's life was intimately connected with that of his father, Ferdinand Porsche, Sr., who began sharing his knowledge of mechanical engineering already in his childhood. With his father he opened a bureau of automobile design, in [[Stuttgart]] in 1931.

They worked together to fulfill their country's [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist]] regime's needs and they met [[Adolf Hitler]] at many business events. [source?] The [[Volkswagen Beetle]] was designed by Ferdinand Porsche, Sr. and a team of engineers, including Ferry Porsche.

After [[World War II]], while his father remained imprisoned in [[France]] being accused of [[war crimes]], Ferry Porsche ran their company. Aided by the postwar Volkswagen enterprise, he created the first cars that were uniquely associated with the company. Despite the political-economical adversities of the postwar years, the company manufactured automobiles and, eventually, became a world powerhouse for producing sports cars.

==Early life==
Ferdinand Porsche Sr was chief designer at [[Austro-Daimler]] in Austria. His designs were focused on compact street cars and race cars. Austro-Daimler was so strongly tied to the local [[Royal family|royalty]] that the Austrian double-headed eagle became the trademark of the company. The day Ferry Porsche was born, his father was competing with one of his race cars (called the Maja) at [[Semmering, Austria|Semmering]], finishing first in his class. He found out about his son's birth by telegram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caradisiac.com/php/voitures_collection/portraits/geants/ferry_porsche.php Ferdinand "Ferry" Porsche: le plus grand des petits constructeurs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829024622/http://www.caradisiac.com/php/voitures_collection/portraits/geants/ferry_porsche.php |date=2007-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferry Porsche's mother was [[Aloisia Johanna Kaes]]. He had an older sister, [[Louise Piëch]], who was five years his senior. He was baptized Ferdinand Anton Ernst Porsche, with the name Ferdinand after his father, the name Anton after his grandfather, and the name Ernst after his uncle on his mother's side. Early in his childhood he picked up the nickname "Ferry" rather than the usual nickname "Ferdy", as Ferdy reminded his parents too much of a typical [[coachman]] nickname&amp;nbsp;— a profession that, coincidentally, was made obsolete by the family's work.

During the following years, the family moved around a lot. He and his father spent much time together in workshops where he began early to learn about mechanical engineering. They also used to tour around [[Europe]] and the [[United States|United States of America]], where they raced the cars they designed.

Ferry remarked later, "...cars were my greatest passion from the very beginning.".&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-385-05309-6}} "We at Porsche, The Autobiography of Dr. Ing. Ferry Porsche with John Bentley"&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on [[Christmas|Christmas Eve]] of 1920, Ferry Porsche was originally misled by his parents, who first presented him with a miniature [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]] pulled by a [[goat]], while his real present was a petrol-driven miniature car with a [[four-stroke engine|four-stroke]], two-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] engine specially designed by his father. Ferry Porsche learned to drive when he was only 10 years old. At age 12 he drove a real race car, the [[Austro-Daimler Sascha]], which had just won its class at [[Targa Florio]], [[Sicily]], in 1922.

Ferry Porsche attended school at [[Wiener Neustadt]] and Stuttgart, concentrating on [[mathematics]].

==Move to Stuttgart==
In 1923, the family moved to [[Stuttgart]], due to senior Ferdinand Porsche's unrest about the squandering financial destiny of Austro-Daimler. He joined the [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] at Stuttgart-[[Untertürkheim]] (where the design department from the whole company was concentrated). Soon, he achieved the position of technical director.

Meanwhile, Ferry Porsche received consent from the company to stay at the plant together with his father because of his increasing interest in design issues. The local town authorities endorsed a special permission for him to drive, even at 16 years of age.

Ferdinand Porsche senior enjoyed success particularly with his racing cars which excelled at the race tracks. His personal preference for designing [[compact cars]] differed with the current policies of (now merged) [[Daimler-Benz]], who were in favor of more luxurious [[Mercedes-Benz]] models.

So, in 1929, Daimler-Benz began to question Porsche's work seriously and halted it suddenly. He worked temporarily as the  technical director of [[Steyr automobile|Steyr AG]] in Austria; nonetheless, he soon decided to open a consulting office of automobile design, again at Stuttgart.

At the same time, after finishing school, Ferry Porsche was residing at Stuttgart where he began working for [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch Company]] in 1928; this was to add depth to his interest in automobile engineering. In 1930, he was taking additional lessons in [[physics]] and [[engineering]], however he never formally enrolled in any university.

==Construction Bureau at Stuttgart==
During the 1930s, Stuttgart had already established itself as a center for the automobile industry. Germany's most important car companies had settled in the region by then. It was thus an ideal location for the new Porsche design company. When Porsche senior opened his offices in April 1931, his son Ferry (then age 21) was by his side. The firm was called "Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH Konstructionsbüro für Motoren, Fahrzeuge, Luftfahrzeuge und Wasserfahrzeugbau", meaning that Ferdinand Porsche's firm specialized in construction and consultation for engines, automobiles, airplanes, and motorboats. Porsche GmbH was founded in 1931 by [[Adolf Rosenberger]], Ferdinand Porsche and Dr. [[Anton Piëch]]. While Rosenberger was the financial backer, he also brought technical knowledge and racing skill to the equation. Father and son were accompanied by renowned engineers.

During the early 1930s, Germany's economic crisis was at its peak. The country was about to be politically dominated by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialists]], who were about to take the government belligerently. In addition to the financial and political crises, Porsche also faced a lack in personnel, altogether greatly limiting the company's prospects initially.

Nevertheless, Porsche soon obtained contracts from important German automotive firms, such as [[Wanderer (car)|Wanderer]], [[Auto Union]], Zwickau, [[Zündapp]] and, starting in 1933, the new German National Socialist regime. Some of these projects had historical impact, such as the mid-engine Auto Union ''[[Silver Arrows|Silver Arrow]]'' race cars, designed by Porsche.

Porsche developed a relatively "amicable" relationship with Adolf Hitler, ever since the firm became involved in military projects. In fact, historical evidence points out that Porsche's firm was probably Hitler's favourite. Porsche readily and eagerly worked for the regime and designed the most effective tanks used in World War II, which effectively undermines any attempts to portray the Porsche family as having a pacifist outlook. Some accounts have Porsche assisting a Jewish employee to escape Germany. Those accounts are interesting because while there is a grain of truth to them, though they play up Porsche's supposed independence from the Reich they obscure the important role of that Jewish "employee", who was actually Adolf Rosenberger. It's quite likely that Porsche GmbH would not have existed were it not for Rosenberger, who was Porsche's partner and financial backer, not his employee. Despite Rosenberger's contribution to the development of German automobiles and German auto racing when Hitler came to power in Germany, Rosenberger, a Jew, was arrested for "[[Rassenschande]]" (racial crimes), and imprisoned at KZ Schloss Kislau near Karlsruhe. He was released, supposedly due to unconfirmed efforts on his behalf by Porsche, but he was forced to leave Germany immediately. While in France, Rosenberger represented Porsche GmbH's business interests.

By those years, a newspaper expressed that "in the automobile world, the name Porsche deserves a monument."&lt;ref&gt;http://content3.eu.porsche.com/prod/classic/classicWorld.nsf/0/9AB653063BBD3B80C1256BEB0050{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferry Porsche, at the time, managed a group of departments ranging from design to customer relationship management. They were: "controlling of testing", "coordinating of the design engineers", and "keeping good relations with clients". In 1935, Ferry married [[Dorothea Reitz]], whom he had first met in the corridors of [[Daimler-Benz]], years before. The couple had four children: [[Ferdinand Alexander Porsche|Ferdinand Alexander]] (born 1935), Gerhard (born 1938), Hans-Peter (born 1940), and Wolfgang (born 1943), and remained married until her death.

In 1938, when his father moved to the new [[Volkswagen]] plant at [[Wolfsburg]], Ferry became deputy manager of the [[Stuttgart]] bureau and relocated the design departments to Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen.

===Volkswagen===
Ferdinand Porsche's old yearning had been to create a small compact car which may be conceived as such "from scratch" (instead of a version derived of an existing [[sedan (car)|sedan]]). Finally, the design work began at their [[:de:Villa Porsche (Stuttgart)|familial residence in Stuttgart]] on ''Feuerbacher Weg''. Therefore, Ferry Porsche had complete access to help his father, intervening on important parts of the project. The work had originally been supported by Zündapp, until backing away soon after due to commercial reasons.

Nonetheless, the Nazis accepted the project on 22 June 1934, interested in producing "an affordable car for the German family". Originally, it was called Porsche (Model) 60 but it was soon officially renamed as the [[KdF-Wagen]] or Volkswagen (people's car).

In the family's garage at Stuttgart, three prototypes were built.

In 1939, when the [[Volkswagen]] factory opened in Wolfsburg, Porsche senior became its general manager. (along with an officer from the Nazi party).

===Auto Union and Wanderer===
Adolf Hitler had also decided to promote German race cars at the [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix Motor Racing]] competitions. Therefore, the government had called for a concourse of the [[state-of-the-art]] racers of the time. Daimler-Benz easily won a bid. When Wanderer applied, it was rejected. Wanderer resorted to the Porsche firm.

In 1932, Ferdinand Porsche met with Adolf Hitler personally and their bid was finally accepted. Ferry Porsche took part in the conception and construction of those race cars, and was also responsible for the general organization of the workshop and the testing of units. In 1933, their first race car was developed with a 4.5 litre V-16 engine and an [[aluminum]] framework.

In 1934, Wanderer and others merged to form [[Auto Union]], and the senior Porsche became the chief designer of their race cars. Both racing teams, Daimler-Benz and Auto Union, were also used for political propaganda by the National Socialists. They overwhelmingly dominated all the competitions of the 1930s. In 1938, Ferdinand Porsche senior left the Auto Union racing team when his contract expired.

==Second World War==
During the war, the Porsche family was completely dedicated to designing motorized weaponry, like tanks, for [[Nazi Germany]]. To avoid the aerial bombings of Stuttgart, Ferry Porsche was forced to bring some of the design departments to Austria, to two locations, [[Gmünd, Carinthia|Gmünd]]/[[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Zell am See]], where the family had a farm. Nonetheless, he stayed personally in Stuttgart, managing the business.

Meanwhile, Porsche senior withstood at Wolfsburg, working for the Germans until the end of the war. The production of compact civilian cars at that factory had been halted, to produce small military jeeps called [[Kübelwagen]].

Though, after Hitler's fall, the French government requested formally to Porsche family to build a French version of the compact Volkswagen, in November 1945, even by bringing the pieces of Wolfsburg's facilities which had survived.

A group of French producers, led by Jean Pierre [[Peugeot]], resisted this though. During an official appointment at Wolfsburg, both Porsche's father and son as well as [[Anton Piëch]], a Viennese attorney who was Louise Porsche's husband, were arrested together as criminals of war, on December 15. Without any trial{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}, a bail of 500,000 [[francs]] was officially asked for each of the Porsche's. It could be afforded only for Ferry Porsche who moved then to Austria, in July 1946. His father was taken instead to a prison at [[Dijon]].

==Porsche company at Gmünd==
After his release, Ferry Porsche attempted to return to Stuttgart but he was barred by the occupation forces. In consequence, in July 1946 he brought all the structure of the company to Gmünd/Carinthia, Austria.

Together with his sister Louise, Ferry took on the management of the company. In the beginning, they also used the workshop to repair cars. Additionally, they commercialized [[pump|water pumps]] and [[lathe]]s.

In time, they obtained two contracts for automobile design. One was for the construction of racecars for the ''[[Cisitalia]]'' racing team. The other was for the design of their own car, which later became known as the Porsche 356.

===Porsche Type 360 - Cisitalia===
As a result of [[Carlo Abarth]]'s mediation, Ferry Porsche inked a contract with [[Piero Dusio]] to produce [[Formula One|Grand Prix racing]] cars again. The new model was called the [[Porsche 360]] Cisitalia, and it was the first to spell out the name of the family's enterprise. Its design was mostly alike to the preceding pre-war ones, despite being smaller. It had a [[supercharger|supercharged]] mid-mounted engine displacing 1.5 liters and [[four-wheel drive]].

===Porsche Type 356===
Following his father's old aspiration, Ferdinand Porsche designed the [[Porsche 356]], with a unique chassis and body while using Volkswagen components. The 356 had an air-cooled, rear-mounted, 4-cylinder engine producing 35&amp;nbsp;hp. Due to the location of its engine, the car was a little unstable but the balance favored potency and light weight.

An automobile dealer from [[Zurich]] ordered the first shipment in the winter of 1947 and production of the automobile began. Under Ferry Porsche's supervision, the units were built completely by hand at an improvised workshop inside a [[sawmill]] at Gmünd.

By June 1948, 50 aluminum-bodied units had been completely assembled. Additionally, 6 frameworks were sent to the Beutler Company at [[Thun]], [[Switzerland]], where they were fitted with [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]] bodies.

Despite its compact size, the car was popular with wealthy customers. If successful, the 356 would mean Porsche's final hop out from performing only designing chores for others. Indeed, surprisingly, the 356 remained in production for many years and by 1965 had sold nearly 78,000 units. Additionally, it laid the framework which was followed by the entirety of the successive series of Porsche's sports cars.

==Ferdinand Porsche's fate==
During his 20 months of jail time in Dijon, Ferdinand Porsche Sr collaborated on designs for [[Renault]] and their later popular [[Renault 4CV|4CV]]. Reportedly, the conditions of imprisonment harmed his health.

In 1947, the junior Ferdinand Porsche gathered the amount of the stipulated bail, immediately after receiving the early fees for his new designs. His father was then released on 1 August 1947, along with Anton Piëch.

Once in Austria, the senior F. Porsche reviewed the designs of his son for both projects; the 360 Cisitalia and the 356. He consented with the plans and aided the projects which were in progress. He commented daily to their employees that he "would have done the same designs as Ferry".

The senior Ferdinand Porsche was rather sick. Noting this, sentimentally, Ferry took him to revisit Wolfsburg's plant which was flourishing with the massive production of the [[Volkswagen Beetle]]—which was carried out under supervision of the British occupation. On November 1950, senior Ferdinand Porsche suffered a stroke which disabled him until his death, on 30 January 1951, aged 75.

==Return to Stuttgart==
In the spring of 1949, the ''general manager'' of Volkswagen, [[Heinz Nordhoff]], approached ''junior'' Ferdinand Porsche and unpacked a massive contract.
For ''Porsche'' 's designing services—for example, improving the ''Beetle''--, it specified that ''Volkswagen'' would start providing in exchange:
*a share of the profits from each ''Beetle'' sold
*the raw materials for building the sport ''Porsche'' 's vehicles
*the usage of ''Volkswagen'' 's world structure of retailers
*the usage of ''Volkswagen'' 's world structure for technical service
Also by this agreement, ''junior'' Ferdinand Porsche would become the only dealer of ''Volkswagen'' for all Austria.

In view of this new stabilized situation, ''junior'' Ferdinand Porsche decided to reestablish the headquarters of the ''Porsche'' at Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen. Though, the old original ''Porsche'' 's facilities were occupied by American forces. Nonetheless, he rented some workshops then from the company ''[[Reutter]]'' (which was a constructor of bodies for automobiles). He brought most of his employees and opened on September 1949. Their first work was the development of an engine which was called ''Carrera''.

In 1950, the production of the ''Porsche 356'' resumed. Eventually, it was so successful that, despite being originally planned an annual production of 500, they had already produced 78,000 units by 1967. Ferdinand Porsche's motto was to produce automobiles which had to be ''reliable and of high-quality sports cars, of a high utilitarian value''.

''Porsche'' 's most recognized involvement in car races began at ''[[24 Hours of Le Mans]]'', on June [[1951 24 Hours of Le Mans|1951]], when an improved version of the ''356'' debuted on this track and won in its category. On successive years, ''Porsche'' 's winning contribution to ''Le Mans'' is regarded as fundamental for the own existence of the circuit. Later, in 1959, ''Porsche'' won for first time an event of the ''[[World Sportscar Championship]]'', at ''[[Targa Florio]]'', while a ''[[Porsche 917]]'' would achieve the first ''Le Mans'' win finally in 1970.

===Porsche - Type 911 (1963)===
At the demand of Porsche's fans, the company began planning a successor to the ''356''. The project was originally called ''[[Porsche 901]]''. Ferdinand Alexander Porsche (who was also nicknamed "Butzi") and Ferdinand Porsche's nephew took charge on designing the new model.

The first units were manufactured in 1962. However, [[Peugeot]] pushed legally for a change of the name, due to its registered trademark on automobile names with a ''zero amid two numbers''. The model was renamed ''Porsche 911''. Over time, it has evolved, but still kept the general shape and architecture since the beginning with a rear-mounted high-performance engine. On the 11th of May 2017, the millionth example was built.

==Porsche plc==
Following his father's death in 1951, Ferry Porsche was the most responsible official of the company, as general manager, the chairman of the [[Board of directors|board of management]]. In 1972, he decided to transform the ''Porsche Company'' (which was a [[limited partnership]]) into a public concern, also by merging all the three enterprises which constituted it:
*''Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche KG'', from Stuttgart
*''VW-Porsche Vertriebsgesellschaft'', from [[Ludwigsburg]]
*''Porsche Konstruktion KG'', from [[Salzburg]]
Additionally, Ferdinand Porsche stepped down from the chairmanship and became honorary chairman of the [[supervisory board]]. In fact, he continued controlling the company as such. He remained in that position until his death In 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biografien.focus.msn.de/templ/te_bio.php?PID=1492&amp;RID=1 Nachrichten, Unterhaltung, Video, Sport, Lifestyle, Finanzen, Auto und mehr bei MSN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ferdinand Alexander Porsche took his place as general manager.

The enterprise became a [[public limited company]] (plc), the ''Porsche GmbH''. Nevertheless, the two deeply seated families, Porsche and Piëch, assured the possession yet of most of the shares. This status has also been kept through the years, until recently.

==Later years==
In 1989, Ferdinand Porsche retired definitively from the activity, returning to his cherished Austrian farm at [[Zell am See]].

Later, one of his last visited events was the launching of a new model, the Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet. It was based on the old ''356'', with a 300&amp;nbsp;hp 6-cylinder water-cooled engine.

He also assisted in the large celebration of the 30 years of the Porsche 911 which took place at Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg. Despite being in an unhealthy condition, he signed autographs and drove through a street of 500 911s. He supported himself with a cane and was wearing a straw hat.

Ferdinand Porsche died 74 days short of the 50th anniversary of the company, at the age of 88, on 27 March 1998, at the farm in Zell am See, Austria. He was buried there at the [[Schüttgut church]], beside his parents, his wife Dorothea and Anton Piëch. Porsche AG conducted a memorial service soon after in Stuttgart.

'''Foreign market entry modes''' or '''participation strategies''' differ in the degree of [[risk]] they present, the control and commitment of resources they require, and the [[return on investment]] they promise.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, F.; Burton, F.; Dowling, P. (2002), International Business, Cengage Learning EMEA, {{ISBN|978-1-86152-452-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two major types of [[market entry]] modes: equity and non-equity modes. The non-equity modes category includes [[export]] and contractual agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Peng, W. Mike., (2008) Global Business. Cengage Learning, {{ISBN|0-324-36073-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equity modes category includes: [[joint venture]] and [[wholly owned subsidiaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Peng, W. Mike., (2008) Global Business. Cengage Learning, {{ISBN|0-324-36073-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exporting==
[[Exports|Exporting]] is the process of selling of goods and services produced in one country to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Yadong, L. (1999), Entry and Cooperative Strategies in International Business Expansion Age, Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-1-56720-161-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of exporting: direct and indirect.

===Direct Exports===

Direct exports represent the most basic mode of exporting made by a (holding) company, capitalizing on [[economies of scale]] in production concentrated in the home country and affording better control over distribution.  Direct export works the best if the volumes are small. Large volumes of export may trigger [[protectionism]]. The main characteristic of direct exports entry model is that there are no intermediaries.

Passive exports represent the treating and filling overseas orders like domestic orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cullen|first=K. Praveen Parboteeah, John B.|title=Strategic international management|date=2011|publisher=South-Western Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=053845296X|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types====

;Sales representatives: Sales representatives represent foreign suppliers/manufacturers in their local markets for an established commission on sales. Provide support services to a manufacturer regarding local advertising, local sales presentations, customs clearance formalities, legal requirements. Manufacturers of highly technical services or products such as production machinery, benefit the most from sales representation.

;Importing distributors: Importing distributors purchase product in their own right and resell it in their local markets to wholesalers, retailers, or both. Importing distributors are a good [[market entry strategy]] for products that are carried in inventory, such as toys, appliances, prepared food.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, F. (2003), Managing Exports: navigating the complex rules, controls, barriers, and laws. Age, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., {{ISBN|0-471-22173-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advantages====

*Control over selection of foreign markets and choice of foreign representative companies
*Good information feedback from target market, developing better relationships with the buyers
*Better protection of trademarks, patents, goodwill, and other intangible property
*Potentially greater sales, and therefore greater profit, than with indirect exporting.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshino, M. Y.; Rang an, U. S. (1995), Strategic alliances: an entrepreneurial approach to globalization, Harvard Business Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Disadvantages====

*Higher start-up costs and higher risks as opposed to indirect exporting
*Requires higher investments of time, resources and personnel and also organizational changes
*Greater information requirements
*Longer time-to-market as opposed to indirect exporting.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, J. (1999), The Global Entrepreneur: taking your business international Age, Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indirect exports===

Indirect export is the process of exporting through domestically based export intermediaries. The exporter has no control over its products in the foreign market.

====Types====

;Export trading companies (ETCs): These provide support services of the entire export process for one or more suppliers. Attractive to suppliers that are not familiar with exporting as ETCs usually perform all the necessary work: locate overseas trading partners, present the product, quote on specific enquiries, etc.

;Export management companies (EMCs): These are similar to ETCs in the way that they usually export for producers. Unlike ETCs, they rarely take on export credit risks and carry one type of product, not representing competing ones. Usually, EMCs trade on behalf of their suppliers as their export departments.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, J. (1999), The Global Entrepreneur: taking your business international Age, Dearborn, {{ISBN|1-57410-124-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Export merchants: Export merchants are wholesale companies that buy unpackaged products from suppliers/manufacturers for resale overseas under their own brand names. The advantage of export merchants is promotion. One of the disadvantages for using export merchants result in presence of identical products under different brand names and pricing on the market, meaning that export merchant’s activities may hinder manufacturer’s exporting efforts.

;Confirming houses: These are intermediate sellers that work for foreign buyers. They receive the product requirements from their clients, negotiate purchases, make delivery, and pay the suppliers/manufacturers. An opportunity here arises in the fact that if the client likes the product it may become a trade representative. A potential disadvantage includes supplier’s unawareness and lack of control over what a confirming house does with their product.

;Nonconforming purchasing agents: These are similar to confirming houses with the exception that they do not pay the suppliers directly – payments take place between a supplier/manufacturer and a foreign buyer.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, Robert (2006), Learning from Exporting: New Insights, New Perspectives, Edward Elgar Publishing Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advantages====

*Fast [[market access]]
*Concentration of resources towards production
*Little or no financial commitment as the clients' exports usually covers most expenses associated with international sales.
*Low risk exists for companies who consider their [[domestic market]] to be more important and for companies that are still developing their [[R&amp;D]], [[marketing]], and sales strategies.
*Export management is outsourced, alleviating pressure from management team
*No direct handle of export processes.&lt;ref&gt;Peng, Mike W. (2009), Global Business, Mason: South-Western College Pub&lt;/ref&gt;

====Disadvantages====

*Little or no control over distribution, sales, marketing, etc. as opposed to direct exporting 
*Wrong choice of distributor, and by effect, market, may lead to inadequate market feedback affecting the international success of the company
*Potentially lower sales as compared to direct exporting (although low volume can be a key aspect of successfully exporting directly). Export partners that incorrectly select a specific distributor/market may hinder a firm's functional ability.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Rachael (2005), Report on a turnkey project for Apple’s iPod in Nigeria, Maryland: University of Maryland University College&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies that seriously consider international markets as a crucial part of their success would likely consider direct exporting as the market entry tool. Indirect exporting is preferred by companies who would want to avoid [[financial risk]] as a threat to their other goals.

==Licensing==
An international [[licensing agreement]] allows foreign firms, either exclusively or non-exclusively to manufacture a proprietor’s product for a fixed term in a specific market.

In this foreign market entry mode, a licensor in the home country makes limited rights or resources available to the licensee in the host country. The rights or resources may include patents, trademarks, managerial skills, technology, and others that can make it possible for the licensee to manufacture and sell in the host country a similar product to the one the licensor has already been producing and selling in the home country without requiring the licensor to open a new operation overseas. The licensor earnings usually take forms of one time payments, technical fees and royalty payments usually calculated as a percentage of sales.

As in this mode of entry the transference of knowledge between the parental company and the licensee is strongly present, the decision of making an international license agreement depend on the respect the host government show for intellectual property and on the ability of the licensor to choose the right partners and avoid them to compete in each other market. Licensing is a relatively flexible work agreement that can be customized to fit the needs and interests of both, licensor and licensee.

Following are the main advantages and reasons to use an international licensing for expanding internationally:
*Obtain extra income for technical know-how and services
*Reach new markets not accessible by export from existing facilities
*Quickly expand without much risk and large capital investment
*Pave the way for future investments in the market
*Retain established markets closed by trade restrictions
*Political risk is minimized as the licensee is usually 100% locally owned
*Is highly attractive for companies that are new in international business.

On the other hand, international licensing is a foreign market entry mode that presents some disadvantages and reasons why companies should not use it as:
*Lower income than in other entry modes
*Loss of control of the licensee manufacture and marketing operations and practices leading to loss of quality
*Risk of having the trademark and reputation ruined by an incompetent partner
*The foreign partner can also become a competitor by selling its production in places where the parental company is already in.

==Franchising==

The [[franchising]] system can be defined as: "A system in which semi-independent business owners (franchisees) pay fees and royalties to a parent company (franchiser) in return for the right to become identified with its trademark, to sell its products or services, and often to use its business format and system." &lt;ref&gt;Franchising is one form of Licensing.

Compared to licensing, franchising agreements tends to be longer and the franchisor offers a broader package of rights and resources which usually includes: equipment, managerial systems, operation manual, initial trainings, site approval and all the support necessary for the franchisee to run its business in the same way it is done by the franchisor. In addition to that, while a licensing agreement involves things such as intellectual property, trade secrets and others while in franchising it is limited to trademarks and operating know-how of the business.&lt;ref&gt;Hoy, F.; Stanworth, J. (2003), Franchising: an international perspective, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of the international franchising mode:
*Low political risk
*Low cost
*Allows simultaneous expansion into different regions of the world
*Well selected partners bring financial investment as well as managerial capabilities to the operation.

Disadvantages of franchising to the franchisor:&lt;ref&gt;Cavusgil,T.; Knight,G.;Riesenberger,J. (2008),International Business - Strategy,Management and the  New Realities, Pearson&lt;/ref&gt;
*Maintaining control over franchisee may be difficult
*Conflicts with franchisee are likely, including legal disputes
*Preserving franchisor's image in the foreign market may be challenging
*Requires monitoring and evaluating performance of franchisees, and providing ongoing assistance
*Franchisees may take advantage of acquired knowledge and become competitors in the future

== Turnkey projects ==

A turnkey project refers to a project when clients pay contractors to design and construct new facilities and train personnel. A turnkey project is a way for a foreign company to export its process and technology to other countries by building a plant in that country. Industrial companies that specialize in complex production technologies normally use turnkey projects as an entry strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Peng, Mike W. (2009), Global Business, Mason: South-Western College Pub&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major advantages of turnkey projects is the possibility for a company to establish a plant and earn profits in a foreign country especially in which foreign direct investment opportunities are limited and lack of expertise in a specific area exists.

Potential disadvantages of a turnkey project for a company include risk of revealing companies secrets to rivals, and takeover of their plant by the host country. Entering a market with a turnkey project CAN prove that a company has no long-term interest in the country which can become a disadvantage if the country proves to be the main market for the output of the exported process.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Rachael (2005), Report on a turnkey project for Apple’s iPod in Nigeria, Maryland: University of Maryland University College, http://globalitek.homestead.com/Rachael_-_Turnkey_projects_Nigeria_and_iPod.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS)==
A wholly owned subsidiary includes two types of strategies: [[Greenfield investment]] and [[Acquisitions]].  [[Greenfield investment]] and [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisition]] include both advantages and disadvantages. To decide which entry modes to use is depending on situations.

[[Greenfield investment]] is the establishment of a new [[wholly owned subsidiary]]. It is often complex and potentially costly, but it is able to provide full control to the firm and has the most potential to provide above average return.&lt;ref&gt;Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, {{ISBN|0-17-650006-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   "[[Wholly owned subsidiaries]] and expatriate staff are preferred in service industries where close contact with end customers and high levels of professional skills, specialized know how, and customization are required."&lt;ref&gt;Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, {{ISBN|0-17-650006-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greenfield investment]] is more likely preferred where physical capital intensive plants are planned.&lt;ref&gt;Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, {{ISBN|0-17-650006-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This strategy is attractive if there are no competitors to buy or the transfer competitive advantages that consists of embedded competencies, skills, routines, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, {{ISBN|978-0-07-310172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenfield investment is high [[Peren-Clement Index|risk]] due to the costs of establishing a new business in a new country.&lt;ref&gt;Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, {{ISBN|978-0-07-310172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A firm may need to acquire knowledge and expertise of the existing market by third parties, such consultant, competitors, or business partners.  This entry strategy takes much time due to the need of establishing new operations, distribution networks, and the necessity to learn and implement appropriate marketing strategies to compete with rivals in a new market.&lt;ref&gt;Bartett, C.A., Ghoshal, S. and Beamish, P. (2008) Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mergers and acquisitions|Acquisition]] has become a popular mode of entering foreign markets mainly due to its quick access&lt;ref&gt;Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, {{ISBN|0-17-650006-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acquisition strategy offers the fastest, and the largest, initial international expansion of any of the alternative.

Acquisition has been increasing because it is a way to achieve greater [[market power]]. The [[market share]] usually is affected by [[market power]]. Therefore, many [[multinational corporations]] apply acquisitions to achieve their greater market power, which require buying a competitor, a supplier, a distributor, or a business in highly related industry to allow exercise of a core competency and capture [[competitive advantage]] in the market.&lt;ref&gt;Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, {{ISBN|0-17-650006-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquisition is lower risk than [[Greenfield investment]] because of the outcomes of an acquisition can be estimated more easily and accurately.&lt;ref&gt;Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, {{ISBN|978-0-07-310172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In overall, acquisition is attractive if there are well established firms already in operations or competitors want to enter the region.

On the other hand, there are many disadvantages and problems in achieving acquisition success.

*Integrating two organizations can be quite difficult due to different organization cultures, control system, and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, {{ISBN|0-17-650006-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Integration is a complex issue, but it is one of the most important things for organizations.
*By applying acquisitions, some companies significantly increased their levels of debt which can have negative effects on the firms because high debt may cause bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, {{ISBN|0-17-650006-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Too much diversification may cause problems.&lt;ref&gt;Hitt, A. (2009), Strategic Management Competitiveness and Globalization, Nelson Education Ltd, {{ISBN|0-17-650006-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Even when a firm is not too over diversified, a high level of diversification can have a negative effect on the firm in the long-term performance due to a lack of management of diversification.

==Difference between international strategy and global strategy==
However, some industries benefit more from globalization than do others, and some nations have a comparative advantage over other nations in certain industries. To create a successful global strategy, managers first must understand the nature of global industries and the dynamics of global competition, international strategy (i.e. internationally scattered subsidiaries act independently and operate as if they were local companies, with minimum coordination from the parent company) and global strategy (leads to a wide variety of business strategies, and a high level of adaptation to the local business environment). Basically there are three key differences between them. Firstly, it relates to the degree of involvement and coordination from the Centre. Moreover, the difference relates to the degree of product standardization and responsiveness to local business environment. The last is that difference has to do with strategy integration and competitive moves.

==Joint venture==
There are five common objectives in a [[joint venture]]: market entry, risk/reward sharing, technology sharing and joint product development, and conforming to the government regulations. Other benefits include political connections and distribution channel access that may depend on relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, J. (1999), The Global Entrepreneur: taking your business international Age, Dearborn, {{ISBN|1-57410-124-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such alliances often are favourable when:
*The partners' strategic goals converge while their competitive goals diverge
*The partners' size, market power, and resources are small compared to the Industry leaders
*Partners are able to learn from one another while limiting access to their own proprietary skills

The key issues to consider in a joint venture are ownership, control, length of agreement, pricing, technology transfer, local firm capabilities and resources, and government intentions. Potential problems include:&lt;ref&gt;Foley, J. (1999), The Global Entrepreneur: taking your business international Age, Dearborn, {{ISBN|1-57410-124-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Conflict over asymmetric new investments
*Mistrust over proprietary knowledge
*Performance ambiguity - how to split the pie
*Lack of parent firm support
*Cultural clashes
*If, how, and when to terminate the relationship

Joint ventures have conflicting pressures to cooperate and compete:&lt;ref&gt;Foley, J. (1999), The Global Entrepreneur: taking your business international Age, Dearborn, {{ISBN|1-57410-124-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Strategic imperative: the partners want to maximize the advantage gained for the joint venture, but they also want to maximize their own competitive position.
*The joint venture attempts to develop shared resources, but each firm wants to develop and protect its own proprietary resources.
*The joint venture is controlled through negotiations and coordination processes, while each firm would like to have hierarchical control.

==Strategic alliance==
strategic alliance is a type of cooperative agreements between different firms, such as shared research, formal joint ventures, or minority equity participation.&lt;ref&gt;Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, {{ISBN|978-0-07-310172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern form of strategic alliances is becoming increasingly popular and has three distinguishing characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, {{ISBN|978-0-07-310172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#They are frequently between firms in industrialized nations.
#The focus is often on creating new products and/or technologies rather than distributing existing ones.
#They are often only created for short term duration, non equity based agreement in which companies are separated and are independent. 

===Advantages===
Some advantages of a strategic alliance include:&lt;ref&gt;Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, {{ISBN|978-0-07-310172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Technology exchange: This is a major objective for many strategic alliances. The reason for this is that many breakthroughs and major technological innovations are based on interdisciplinary and/or inter-industrial advances. Because of this, it is increasingly difficult for a single firm to possess the necessary resources or capabilities to conduct their own effective R&amp;D efforts. This is also perpetuated by shorter product life cycles and the need for many companies to stay competitive through innovation. Some industries that have become centers for extensive cooperative agreements are:
:*Telecommunications
:*Electronics
:*Pharmaceuticals
:*Information technology
:*Specialty chemicals

;Global competition: There is a growing perception that global battles between corporations be fought between teams of players aligned in strategic partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, {{ISBN|978-0-07-310172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic alliances will become key tools for companies if they want to remain competitive in this globalized environment, particularly in industries that have dominant leaders, such as cell phone manufactures, where smaller companies need to ally in order to remain competitive.

;Industry convergence: As industries converge and the traditional lines between different industrial sectors blur, strategic alliances are sometimes the only way to develop the complex skills necessary in the time frame required. Alliances become a way of shaping competition by decreasing competitive intensity, excluding potential entrants, and isolating players, and building complex value chains that can act as barriers.&lt;ref&gt;Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, {{ISBN|978-0-07-310172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Economies of scale and reduction of risk: Pooling resources can contribute greatly to economies of scale, and smaller companies especially can benefit greatly from strategic alliances in terms of cost reduction because of increased economies of scale.
In terms on risk reduction, in strategic alliances no one firm bears the full risk, and cost of, a joint activity. This is extremely advantageous to businesses involved in high risk / cost activities such as R&amp;D. This is also advantageous to smaller organizations which are more affected by risky activities.

;Alliance as an alternative to merger: Some industry sectors have constraints to cross-border mergers and acquisitions, strategic alliances prove to be an excellent alternative to bypass these constraints. Alliances often lead to full-scale integration if restrictions are lifted by one or both countries.

===Risks of competitive collaboration===
Some strategic alliances involve firms that are in fierce competition outside the specific scope of the alliance. This creates the risk that one or both partners will try to use the alliance to create an advantage over the other. The benefits of this alliance may cause unbalance between the parties, there are several factors that may cause this asymmetry:&lt;ref&gt;Bartett, C.A. (2009), Transnational Management: Text, Cases and Readings in Cross-Border Management. 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill Higher Education, {{ISBN|978-0-07-310172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The partnership may be forged to exchange resources and capabilities such as technology. This may cause one partner to obtain the desired technology and abandon the other partner, effectively appropriating all the benefits of the alliance.
*Using investment initiative to erode the other partners competitive position. This is a situation where one partner makes and keeps control of critical resources. This creates the threat that the stronger partner may strip the other of the necessary infrastructure.
*Strengths gained by learning from one company can be used against the other. As companies learn from the other, usually by task sharing, their capabilities become strengthened, sometimes this strength exceeds the scope of the venture and a company can use it to gain a competitive advantage against the company they may be working with.
*Firms may use alliances to acquire its partner. One firm may target a firm and ally with them to use the knowledge gained and trust built in the alliance to take over the other.

===Disadvantages===

# Difficult to find a good partner
# Risk of unequal partnership
# Loss of control
# Relationship management across borders

==Choosing a Partner for International Strategic Alliances==

#Strategic compatibility
#:The partners need to have the same general goal and understanding in forming a joint venture. The differences in strategy produces more conflicts of interest in the later partnership (Lilley and Willianms, 1991).
#Complementary skills and resources
#:Another important criterion is that the partners need to contribute more than just money to the venture (Geringer and Michael, 1988).  Each partner must contribute some skills and resources that complement for another.
#Relative company size
#:Different size of companies may cause domination of one firm or unequal agreement, which is not favourable for long-term running (Lilley and Willianms, 1991)
#Financial capability
#:The partners can generate sufficient financial resources to maintain the venture’s efforts, which is also important for long-term partnership (Lilley and Willianms, 1991)

Some more like compatibility between operating policies (Lilley and Willianms, 1991), trust and commitment (Lilley and Willianms, 1991), compatible management styles (Geringer and Michael, 1988), mutual dependency(Lilley and Willianms, 1991), communications barriers (Lilley and Willianms, 1991) and avoid anchor partners (Geringer and Michael, 1988) are also important for partner selection but less important than the first four.

==Political Issues==

Political issues will be faced mostly by the companies who want to enter a country that with unsustainable political environment (Parboteeah and Cullen, 2011). A political decisions will affect the business environment in a country and affect the profitability of the business in the country (Click, 2005). Organizations with investments in such opaque countries as Zimbabwe, Myanmar, and Vietnam have long-term experiences about how the political risk affects their business behaviors (Harvard Business Review, 2014).

The following are the examples of political issues:

1.	The politically jailing of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the business giant, in Russia (Wade, 2005);
2.	The "Open-door" policy of China(Deng,2001);
3.	The Ukraine disputed elections resulting in the uncertain president recent years (Harvard Business Review, 2014); 
4.	The corrupt legal system in many countries, such as Russia (Samara, 2008)

==Three different rules of entry mode selection==

The following introductions were based on the statement of Hollensen:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hollensen|first=Svend|title=Essentials of global marketing|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Harlow, Essex, England|isbn=9780273717843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Naïve rule. The decision maker uses the same entry mode for all foreign markets. The companies use this rule as the entry mode selection ignore the differences of individual foreign markets. The performance of this selection could not be calculated, because it highly depends on the luck of the manager.
# Pragmatic rule. The decision maker uses a workable entry mode for each foreign market, which means that the manager use different entry modes depend on the time stage or the business stage. For example, as the first step to international business, companies tend to use exporting. 
# Strategy rules. This approach means that the company systematically compared all of the entry modes and evaluated the value before any choice is made. This approach is common in large firms, because the research requires resources, capital and time. It is rarely to see a small or medium-sized company use this approach.

Besides these three rules, managers have their own ways to select entry modes. If the company could not generate a mature market research, the manager tend to choose the entry modes most suitable for the industry or make decisions by intuition.

==Case analysis of Foreign Direct Investment of Telecommunication Company in Albania==
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is an important factor for a country’s [[economic growth]] especially in its impacts on transmission of technology and developments in management and marketing strategies. FDI takes place when a firm acquires ownership control of a production unit in a foreign country.

According to the content there are basically three forms of FDI: establishing new branch, acquiring control share of an existing firm, and participating jointly in a domestic firm. As [[Albanian economy]] has changed from a centrally planned to a market oriented one, FDI is seen as an important component of the transition process toward a market-led economic system, since it contributes to the development of a country through multiple channels (Kukeli, et al., 2006; Kukeli, 2007). In their study, a limited number of successful mobile networks entry cases have been selected for deep investigation of entry models in Albania, to find out the most important and efficient determinants of foreign mobile networks entry into Albania’s telecommunication market in the future as well. It provides a successful Albanian business experience for the new comers in mobile telecommunications industry. With its developing market economy, Albania offers many opportunities for investors-property as labour costs are low, the young and educated population is ready to work, and tariffs and other legal restrictions are low in many cases and are being eliminated in some others (Albinvest, 2010). Location of Albania in itself offers a notable trade potential, especially with EU markets, since it shares borders with Greece and Italy. In the last years Albania has entered the free trade agreements with Balkan Countries creating the opportunity for trade throughout the region. As Albanian economy tends to grow, the prospects and opportunities of multinational enterprises (MNEs) to invest in Albania for a long-term period has increased also. However, after the transition to democracy since 1992, the country has taken a long way in terms of economic, political and social life (Ministry of Economy 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;9-10). Demirel (2008) finds all of these changes to form the strengths of Albania in terms of FDI. In his study Demirel (2008) emphasizes that Albania has one of the most friendly investment environments in the region of the South- Eastern European Countries (SEECs) with her impressive economic performance in the last decade, liberal economic legislation, rapid privatisation process and country specific advantages. By taking into account all of these factors, the aim of this study is to offer a new perspective by the case studies of foreign telecommunications companies, which form the majority of MNEs in this field, by finding the most significant determinants before entering into Albania, with a successful entry strategy and crucial consideration of FDI in Albania. It is crucially important to find the determinants and factors that affect multinational firms when deciding on their entry modes, in order to successfully compete in the Albanian mobile telecoms industry. There are four operators in these industries; two of the leading firms expand rapidly in Albania by utilizing successful and aggressive entry strategies, and the other ones are new entries in Albanian market. Lin (2008) emphasizes that the evaluation of the entry modes’ determinants is better to be applied in some main theories and models such as transaction cost theory, eclectic theory and internationalization model, which serve as theoretical foundation in these kind of studies, where host-country condition, political and economic context, and organization capabilities are important factors and require major consideration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4039">'''Hu Fa-kuang''' {{post-nominals|country=HKG|GBM|CBE|JP}} ({{zh-t|胡法光}}, born 14 February 1924) is a Hong Kong businessman and politician. He was the [[unofficial member]] of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] and was chairman of the [[Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong]], a conservative pro-business party in the early 1990s.

==Biography==
Hu was born in [[Shanghai]], China on 14 February 1924. He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University|Chiao Tung University]] and later moved to Hong Kong in 1952. He became the director and managing director of Ryoden (Holdings) Ltd and other companies.

He was appointed to various public positions, including chairman of the Transport Tribunal, the Financial Committee of the [[Hong Kong Housing Authority]] and the Council for Recreation and Sport and a promoter of sport activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hong Kong Housing Authority annual report | publisher=Hong Kong Housing Authority|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also member of the Transport Advisory Committee. He was also member of the [[Urban Council]] and the [[Wan Chai District Council|Wan Chai District Board]].

Hu was first appointed [[unofficial member]] of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] in 1979. He went on to serve in the council until 1991. In 1990, Hu became the founding chairman of the [[Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong]] (LDF) which consisted of businesspeople to contest against the liberal [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]] in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1991|1991 first direction election]]. The Federation won three seats in the end and was defeated by pro-democracy camp. The LDF quickly went decline as the pro-business [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] and pro-Beijing [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]] (DAB) were formed in the early 1990s. In 1997, LDF was merged into another pro-business party [[Hong Kong Progressive Alliance]].

During the 1990s, Hu took part in negotiation and preparatory works for the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. He was a member of the [[Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR]] and a delegate to the Chinese [[People's Political Consultative Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=105|title=Seeing Red: China's Uncompromising Takeover of Hong Kong|last=Allen|first=Jamie|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ibrahim Musa Gashash''' was a [[Kano]] [[Merchant|trader]] and [[politician]] who was among a group of prominent Northern [[Nigerian]]s that formed the Northern People's Congress. Along with two other Kano [[merchants]], he helped establish the first indigenous [[Pilgrimage]] tour company in Kano. 

Gashash was a descendant of a [[Tripoli]]tanian [[Arab]] family from Ghademes.

==Life==

===Business career===
In the 1950s, Ibrahim Gashash was among a select few of Nigerian traders that acquired [[licenses]] to trade in [[commodities]], especially [[peanut|groundnut]] and [[cotton]]. The merchants who acquired  the license were named Licensed Buying Agents (LBA), while membership into the league of agents was discriminatory. The requirements to become one included knowledge of the English language, book keeping and  a high capital base. The agents were usually involved in buying [[Kola nut]], ground nut and cotton from producers and transporting the goods to major trade centers for further exchange with exporters or major trading companies of the era. Gashash, succeeded in this environment as an indigenous produce buying agent.&lt;ref name=LOmeier&gt;Roman Loimeier. Islamic Reform and Political Change in Northern Nigeria, Northwestern University Press, 1997. p 88-89. {{ISBN|0-8101-1346-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high barrier of entry towards acquisiition of the license among indigenous traders resulted in a few class of merchant elite in Kano, with trade in the ancient city dominated by [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantine]] [[businessmen]]. Gashash's, LBA, gave him the opportunity to use his knowledge of Kano farmers and traders as an edge in transaction, and the avenue to exapand into the transportation business, partially to transport his good to major trade center. 

In 1948, along with [[Mamuda Dantata]] (son of [[Alhassan Dantata]]) and Haruna Kashim, he founded the [[West African Pilgrims Association]], a tour agency that organized [[pilgrimages]] to [[Mecca]]. The group later expanded into the [[hotel]] business, with [[Bakin Zuwo]] as manager. In 1950, he co-founded the Kano Citizens Trading Company along with other Kano merchants, the cooperative was the first indigenous joint commercial enterprise formed in Kano and Gashash became secretary of the company.  

By the 1950s, Gashash had emerged as a financier of the Northern People's Congress and was later made minister for Land and Survey

===Political career===
In 1952, Gashash became the regional president of the Northern People's Congress, after an emergency [[Political convention|convention]] had been called  due to a large proportion of executive party leaders not being legislators or members of the Northern Regional Assembly, a dangerous mistake in a [[parliamentary]] system of government. The party was original made up of notable and prominent men from the north.&lt;ref name=Post&gt;K. W. J. Post. The Nigerian Federal Election of 1959: Politics and Administration in a Developing Political System, Oxford University Press, 1963. p 122.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1952, a working committee later joined by Musa Gashash, was set up to create the organizational structures of the nascent [[political organization]]. Gashash later became a minister without portfolio in 1956-1958,&lt;ref name=Bello&gt;Ahmadu Bello. My Life, Cambridge University Press, 1962. p 198, 209, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958, he was made Minister for social welfare and cooperatives and by 1960, he was the minister for Land and Survey.

Heymann was born in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], and studied Romance languages and English at the Universities of [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt]] and [[University of Lisbon (1911–2013)|Lisbon]], at [[King's College London]] and finally at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris. To pay his way through university he worked as a tennis coach. He worked in advertising sales and special supplement production for an American newspaper in his native Frankfurt, then worked in international marketing for [[Braun (company)|Braun AG]]. He first went to [[Hong Kong]] in 1967 to start up the office of the [[Overseas Weekly]], the American newspaper he had worked for in Frankfurt. He "arrived with a suitcase and a typewriter, and strangely enough the hotel which had been booked for me didn't exist anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com.hk/big-smog/features/40251/hongkonger-klaus-heymann.html |title=Time Out Hong Kong &amp;#124; Big Smog &amp;#124; Hong Kong news, current affairs, politics and social issues &amp;#124; Hongkonger: Klaus Heymann |publisher=Timeout.com.hk |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently created a direct-mail advertising business, then a mail-order company providing goods to members of the [[United States military]] in [[Vietnam]]. He sold such items as cameras, watches and audio equipment, including [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] speakers and [[Revox]] tape recorders.

Following the end of the war in Vietnam, Heymann became the Hong Kong distributor for Bose and Revox, and, later, [[Studer]] recording studio equipment. He began organizing classical music concerts to help boost the sales of the brands he sold. When Heymann found that many of the musicians who performed at these concerts could not find their recordings in Hong Kong record shops, he started importing a number of classical record labels, including [[Vox Records|Vox]]-Turnabout, [[Hungaroton]], [[Supraphon]] and [[Opus Records]], for his company Studer-Revox (Hong Kong) to be later renamed Pacific Music. Heymann was asked to join the board of the then amateur [[Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra]] in 1973, and helped this orchestra become a full-time professional orchestra in 1974. At this time, he also met his future wife, Japanese violinist [[Takako Nishizaki]], who came to play as soloist with the Hong Kong Philharmonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naxos.com/aboutus.asp?page=klaus |title=About Klaus Heymann of Naxos Global Distribution Ltd |publisher=Naxos.com |date=2011-06-25 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heymann's desire to help his wife's career led him to start making her recordings including that of the Chinese ''[[Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto]]'' with the [[Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra]]. Since 1978, it sold several hundred thousand copies legitimately and millions in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naxos.com/aboutus.asp?page=recordings |title=Naxos First Recordings |publisher=Naxos.com |date=2011-06-25 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this unexpected success, Heymann created a label called HK to record other works with the Hong Kong Philharmonic and the [[Singapore Symphony Orchestra]]. At the same time, he began to import and license music from pop labels such as [[RCA]], [[Arista Records|Arista]], [[Virgin Records]], [[Chrysalis Records]] and others.

While Heymann was successful selling records of Asian music, he wanted to record rare works, and decided to create the Marco Polo label to do this.&lt;ref name="Soames2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicolas Soames|title=The Story Of Naxos: The extraordinary story of the independent record label that changed classical recording for ever|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlg5DPfjkNAC&amp;pg=PT32|date=3 May 2012|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-0-7481-3110-5|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially recording in Hong Kong and Singapore, Heymann switched to eastern European countries, profiting from his connections with the Hungaroton and Opus labels, located in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, which he distributed.

In 1987, Heymann founded the [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] label, with the goal of selling budget-priced classical CDs. His goal was to sell CDs at the same price as LPs, or roughly one-third of the price of CDs at the time. At first, he was acquiring digital recordings from a German company.  Then, Naxos began developing its catalog with young or unknown artists and orchestras. Heymann assumed the Naxos catalog would not cover more than fifty releases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naxos.com/aboutus.asp?page=birth |title=The Birth of Naxos |publisher=Naxos.com |date=2011-06-25 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking that the major labels would begin competing in the same sector, but given the success of the label, the company went on to become a full-fledged classical label covering a wide range of music. Over the years, Heymann led the label to not only record the standard classical repertoire, but also to focus on works that were not often recorded, or not at all. The company is "still filling gaps in the repertoire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/features/focus/the-future-of-listening-will-be-an-all-you-eat-formula?page=0,1 |title=Naxos founder Klaus Heymann on what lies ahead for classical recordings - Page 2 |publisher=gramophone.co.uk |date=2010-08-24 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heymann was one of the early proponents of digital music, and led Naxos to put its entire catalog on-line for streaming in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/klaus-heymann-the-last-record-man-standing/ |title=Klaus Heymann: The Last Record Man Standing |publisher=NewMusicBox |date=2012-06-18 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; via hnh.com that became naxos.com. In 2002, he launched the Naxos Music Library, essentially used by educational institutions and libraries. In 2007, Heymann stated that "the label was positioned to survive and prosper without selling CDs,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicsonline.com/executive_bio.aspx |title=Press Room |publisher=Classicsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055533/http://www.classicsonline.com/executive_bio.aspx |archivedate=2013-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "revenue from other sources is now big enough to let us not only survive but lead a healthy, profitable existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereophile.com/interviews/1207hey/ |title=Klaus Heymann: A 20th-Anniversary Chat with the Founder of Naxos |publisher=Stereophile.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also created distribution companies in most major music markets to distribute Naxos recordings, and the group of companies is now a major distributor of classical recordings and classical music DVDs around the world, including those of [[Warner Classics]] and [[Sony]].

Heymann claimed, in a 2007 interview with Stereophile Magazine, that he was only just making a "decent return" from the more than $80 million he invested in the company, "thanks to the advent of digital platforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereophile.com/content/klaus-heymann-20th-anniversary-chat-founder-naxos-page-2 |title=Klaus Heymann: A 20th-Anniversary Chat with the Founder of Naxos Page 2 |publisher=Stereophile.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sees the future of the classical music market as a mix of CDs, downloads and streaming: "Whether physical product will be a half of today or a third of today, nobody knows. There will also be downloads, and all kinds of subscription things. Our streaming classical-music library right now is by far the most successful in our field, and the most profitable for us and for the labels. But there may be others that mix paid and unpaid [streaming]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereophile.com/news/klaus_heymann_of_naxos/ |title=Klaus Heymann of Naxos |publisher=Stereophile.com |date=2010-08-25 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heymann's strategy is to be "the last man standing in terms of distributing classical music in physical form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Midgette |first=Anne |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-classical-beat/2010/07/the_future_of_the_recording_in.html |title=The Classical Beat - The future of the recording industry: is there one? |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Heymann successfully sued music critic [[Norman Lebrecht]] for defamation, for a book entitled ''Maestros, Masterpieces and Madness: The Secret Life and Shameful Death of the Classical Record Industry'', published by Penguin, which led to the UK publisher pulping all copies of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Andrew |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/music-critics-book-is-pulped-as-penguin-loses-defamation-case-398144.html |title=Music critic's book is pulped as Penguin loses defamation case - Crime - UK |publisher=The Independent |date=2007-10-28 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heymann is also the co-founder of Artaria Editions, a music-publishing house with a specialist interest in rare eighteenth-century repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artaria.com|title=Artaria Editions – High quality sheet music from the 18th century|website=Artaria Editions|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heymann lives in Hong Kong with his wife Takako Nishizaki and their son Henryk.

{{Nihongo|'''Kosaku Inaba'''|稲葉 興作|Inaba Kōsaku|January 16, 1924 – November 16, 2006}} was a [[Singapore]]-born Japanese businessman, former president of [[Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries]] Co., head of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (1993–2001) and second president of [[Nippon Kaigi]] (1998–2001).&lt;ref name=JapanTimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Kosaku Inaba|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/11/30/business/obituary-kosaku-inaba/#.VoyEOPFcT5k|accessdate=6 January 2016|work=The Japan Times Online|date=30 November 2006|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a graduate of [[Azabu High School]] and [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]].

In recent years,{{when|date=September 2018}} celebrities have signed contracts with [[perfume]] houses to '''associate their name with a signature scent''', as a self-promotion campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mimifroufrou.com/scentedsalamander/celebrity_perfumes/ List of recent and historical celebrity perfume launches at The Scented Salamander]&lt;/ref&gt; The scents are then marketed; the association with the celebrity's name usually being the selling point of the campaign. Such products generally do not have the longevity of classic perfumes. A notable exception is "[[Curious (fragrance)|Curious]]", endorsed by [[Britney Spears]] and made and marketed by [[Elizabeth Arden]]. It was released in 2004 and has gone on to sell over 500 million bottles worldwide,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} "[[Fantasy (fragrance)|Fantasy]]" also being endorsed by Spears has had various remakes and have all sold substantial amounts{{clarify|date=May 2018}} internationally. Most notable would be "White Diamonds", endorsed by [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and made and marketed by [[Elizabeth Arden]]. It was still the best-selling celebrity-endorsed perfume 20 years after its introduction in 1991.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

'''''Manhattan, inc.''''' was an American monthly magazine published in New York City. From 1984 to 1990 it profiled the rich and powerful figures of New York City's business world, and featured stories by prominent freelancers such as [[John Seabrook]], [[Ron Rosenbaum]], and [[Gwenda Blair]].&lt;ref name=Carmody/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kasindorf&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Amsterdam News|first=Jeanie|last=Kasindorf|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=May 30, 1988|pages=40–44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Manhattan, inc.'' was founded by [[D. Herbert Lipson]], owner of ''[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]]''  and ''[[Boston (magazine)|Boston]]'' magazines. The first issue  debuted in September, 1984, edited by [[Jane Amsterdam]], who previously edited ''[[New Times (magazine)|New Times]]'' and ''[[The American Lawyer]]''. In 1985, after only four issues, it received a [[National Magazine Award]] for General Excellence.&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite book|first=Colleen|last= Sullivan|editor-first1=Sam G.| editor-last1= Riley|editor-first2=Gary W. |editor-last2=Selnow|contribution=Manhattan, inc.|title=Regional Interest Magazines of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wb_1YI0zSxIC&amp;pg=PA140|year=1991|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-26840-3|pages=140–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amsterdam and eight other staffers departed in March 1987 over a dispute with Lipson about editorial integrity.&lt;ref name=Kasindorf/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipson, Inc."&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Diamond|first=Edwin|title=Lipson, Inc.|magazine=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KeUCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|date=27 April 1987|pages=28–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clay Felker]], the founding editor of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', replaced Amsterdam as editor.&lt;ref name=Sullivan/&gt;  Under Felker, the magazine became 
"less sassy, less critical, and more featurish in tone"&lt;ref name=Sullivan/&gt; (''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' magazine wrote Felker "helped dull the magazine's cutting edge").&lt;ref name="Spy 1990"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Urquhart|first=Rachel |title=Voyage to the Bottom of the Newsstand|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_zMJ8RrL7CxoC#page/n61/mode/2up|magazine=[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]] |date=November 1990|pages=60–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It suffered financially after the [[October 1987 stock market crash]], and ceased publication in July, 1990, merging with the men's lifestyle magazine ''M'' to become ''M, inc.''&lt;ref name=Carmody&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carmody|first1=Deirdre|title=Like the 80's, Manhattan, inc.

Calling it a "[[Yuppie]] Anti-Yuppie Magazine," writer [[Brian Morton (American writer)|Brian Morton]] described ''Manhattan, inc.'' as "aimed at a young, hip audience of people who see through the hypocrisies of the business world even as they want to make their way in it."&lt;ref name="Morton 1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morton |first=Brian|editor-first=Jim|editor-last= Sleeper|title=In Search of New York|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k78wjoTW-iQC&amp;pg=PA169|year=1989|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-2612-9|pages=169|chapter= The Banker's Red Suspenders: Looking at Yuppie Anti-Yuppie Magazines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Masters in Business and Management''' ('''MBM''') is a general category of "[[Master's degree|master]] in business" or "master in management" degrees, usually pursued by students immediately after completing a bachelor's degree (which distinguishes the MBM from the post-experience [[MBA]] degree, which usually requires at least three years of work experience). Common MBM variations include MSc Management and MSc International Management.

The MBM is open to graduates in all fields of the humanities, arts, engineering, science and business. It is designed to equip students with generalist managerial and leadership skills that will improve their practice and help them start a successful career in business management. The curriculum is therefore often very similar to that of an MBA, though the teaching and learning styles may be different in order to account for the variations in prior work experience.

The [[Association of MBAs]] has been accrediting MBM degrees since 2005 and has [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] over 40 programs at international [[business school]]s.

'''May Austin Elizabeth Mann Jennings''' (April 25, 1872 &amp;ndash; April 25, 1963) was the [[First Lady]] of [[Florida]] as wife of [[Governor of Florida|Florida Governor]] [[William Sherman Jennings]]. She was one of Florida's most powerful and influential women. 
  
==Early years==
May Mann was born in the Centerville section of [[Bayonne, New Jersey]]. Her parents moved to [[Crystal River, Florida]] in 1874&lt;ref name=STETSON&gt;[http://www.flheritage.com/museum/collections/families/mansionlife.cfm State of Florida, Division of Historical Resources: First Families of Florida-Mansion Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010144628/http://www.flheritage.com/museum/collections/families/mansionlife.cfm |date=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where her father, Austin Mann, was elected to the [[Florida Senate]]. Her mother died in 1882 when she was 9, and her father sent May and her younger sister away to [[St. Joseph Academy (St. Augustine, Florida)|St. Joseph Academy]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida]].  The children spent vacations with their father in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] when the [[Florida Legislature|Legislature]] was in [[Legislative session|session]]. May was very bright and learned everything she could about people, politics and the [[Florida State Capitol|Capitol]]. She graduated valedictorian of her class in 1889. Austin Mann ran for the [[Florida House of Representatives|state House of Representatives]] and May assisted in the campaign, hosting [[Tea (meal)|teas]] and talking with people at rallies.&lt;ref name=FTU&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/040903/nec_12220156.shtml Florida Times-Union: April 9, 2003-Wife turns into a good politician by Mary Jo McTammany]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage ==
Mann met [[Hernando County, Florida|Hernando County]] Judge [[William Sherman Jennings]] at her father's home near Brooksville, and a courtship began.&lt;ref name=EVERGLADES&gt;[http://everglades.fiu.edu/reclaim/bios/jenningsmm.htm Florida International University: Reclaiming the Everglades-May Mann Jennings]&lt;/ref&gt; May's father won the election and when the legislative session began in January, 1891, May went to Tallahassee to serve as her father's aide, with responsibility for her father's appointments, correspondence and hosting social events.&lt;ref name=FTU /&gt; Williams Jennings came to Tallahassee and the courtship continued. Judge Jennings married May Mann on May 12, 1891 and they were escorted down the aisle by the full legislative membership.&lt;ref name=FTU /&gt;

The newlyweds lived in Brooksville in the [[William Sherman Jennings House]]. Her husband  was elected to the Florida legislature in 1893 and became Speaker of the House in 1895. The couple had one child, a son, Sherman Bryan Jennings. William then ran for and was elected governor in 1900. Many credit his meteoric rise in the [[Florida Democratic Party|state Democratic Party]] to May's extensive knowledge of state politics and politicians and her vast network of Florida Federation of Woman's Club members.&lt;ref name=FTU /&gt; 

They moved to Tallahassee for four years in the governor’s mansion in 1901. Following her husband’s term as governor, the couple moved to Jacksonville, then Florida’s largest city, where he established a successful law practice. They divided their time between a home in Jacksonville and a farm and timber holdings in Clay County near Middleburg. &lt;ref name=JAX&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/101307/nec_207484330.shtml My Clay Sun: October 11, 2007-W.S. Jennings' name became part of Liberty ship lore]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civic work==
Jennings was an organizer of the Duval County Federation of Women's clubs and was president of the Florida [[General Federation of Women's Clubs|Federation of Women's Clubs]].&lt;ref name=EVERGLADES /&gt; She used that network of motivated women to fight for issues including [[Conservation movement|environmental conservation]], [[Child protection|child welfare]], [[Women's suffrage]], the [[State Library of Florida]] in Tallahassee, [[Indian reservation|reservations]] for the [[Seminole]]s, the establishment of [[compulsory education]], [[Agricultural fencing#Fence laws|stock fence laws]], and [[Florida State Parks|state parks]]. Club women across the state worked in campaign drives, lobbied legislators and appealed to other organizations for assistance.&lt;ref name=GREAT&gt; [http://www.dos.state.fl.us/news/communications/pressRelease/pressRelease.cfm?id=280 Florida Department of State: March 14, 2008-2008 Great Floridians] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192859/http://www.dos.state.fl.us/news/communications/pressRelease/pressRelease.cfm?id=280 |date=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After she was widowed in 1920, she was co-founder of the [[League of Women Voters of Florida|Florida State League of Women Voters]].&lt;ref&gt;Carver, Joan S. "First League of Women Voters in Florida: Its Troubled History." The Florida Historical Quarterly 63, no. 4 (1985): 383-405. https://www.jstor.org/stable/30152979&lt;/ref&gt; She campaigned and spoke for [[prohibition]], better treatment of [[Children's rights|children]] and [[Prisoners' rights|prisoners]], [[Progressive education|education reforms]] and funding, improvements in [[Social welfare provision|public welfare]], [[historic preservation]] and [[highway beautification]].

She died on April 25, 1963.

==Legacy==
She was known as the "Mother of Florida Forestry" for her part in promoting and securing the legislative act that created the Florida State Board of Forestry,&lt;ref name=EVERGLADES /&gt; known today as the Division of Forestry. According to Ruthanne Vogel of the [[University of Miami]], "She was...instrumental in the development of Royal Palm State Park near Homestead," later donated to the [[National Park Service]] and incorporated into [[Everglades National Park]].&lt;ref name=EVERGLADES /&gt;

==Honors==

'''Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden''' ({{lang-ar|محمد بن عوض بن لادن}}; 1908 – 3 September 1967) was a multi-millionaire Saudi businessman working primarily in the [[construction industry]].  He founded what is today the [[Saudi Binladin Group]] and became the wealthiest non-royal Saudi, establishing the wealth and prestige of the [[Bin Laden family]].  He was the father of [[Osama bin Laden]].

==Life==
Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden was born on the [[Hadhramaut]] coast of south [[Yemen]] in 1908 to Awad bin Aboud bin Laden, a [[Kindah|Kindite]] [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] tribesman from al-Rubat, a village in Wadi Doan; Mohammed's paternal grandfather was Aboud bin Laden, the son of Ali bin Laden, one of four brothers (the others being Ahmed, Mansour, and Zaid) from whom the four [[bin Laden family|bin Laden]] clans trace their ancestry. His son [[Osama bin Laden]] was the notorious founder of [[al-Qaeda]], the [[Sunni]] [[militant Islamist]] organization.

Poor and uneducated, Mohammed emigrated to [[Tihamah]] before [[World War I]], initially working as a porter in [[Jeddah]]. In 1930, he started his own construction business and after coming to the attention of [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud]], first monarch of [[Saudi Arabia]], he eventually achieved such success that his family became known as "the wealthiest non-royal family in the kingdom."

Mohammed bin Laden's enormous financial success was ascribed to a shrewd business sense, fealty to Saudi Arabia's rulers, reliability and a willingness to offer the lowest bid on construction contracts.

As the "royal builder," Mohammed bin Laden forged close relationships with the royal family, particularly [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Prince Faisal]] of Saudi Arabia. In 1964, Prince Faisal deposed his half-brother, [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Saud]], and began rebuilding the kingdom after the wasteful excesses of the Saud era. King Faisal accepted Mohammed bin Laden's offer of financial assistance to support the national economy and as a reward, King Faisal issued a royal decree awarding all future construction projects to bin Laden's construction company. As a result, bin Laden's company eventually amassed assets in excess of US$5 billion.
He made his initial fortune from exclusive rights to all mosque and other religious building construction in Saudi Arabia and several other Arab countries.  Until 1967, Mohammed bin Laden held exclusive responsibility for restorations at the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in [[Jerusalem]].

Despite his royal associations and great wealth, Mohammed bin Laden lived a relatively simple and devout life compared to many wealthy Saudis, demanding that his children observe a strict religious and moral code.  In his later years, the bin Laden corporate network diversified its activities beyond construction, largely in foreign investment and oil.

== Wives and children ==
He fathered a total of 56 children by 22 wives. Mohammed never had more than four wives at a time—divorcing older wives and marrying new ones as needed to limit the number of current wives to four and stay within the letter of [[Polygyny in Islam|Sunni Islam marriage law]]. According to [[Carmen bin Ladin]], Mohammed was planning to wed a 23rd wife the night he died, and was heading there when his plane crashed.&lt;ref name=CBLpp65-66&gt;{{Citation

Osama bin Ladin’s mother, [[Hamida al-Attas]], was born and raised in Syria before marrying Bin Laden and moving to Saudi Arabia. She was Mohammed’s 11th wife.

== Death ==
On 3 September 1967, Mohammed bin Laden was killed when his company airplane, a [[Beechcraft]], crashed during landing in Oom, [['Asir Province]], in southwest Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;The Bin Ladens – Steve Coll (Penguin, 2008), pp. 118–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Following Mohammed bin Laden's death, his eldest sons, principally [[Salem bin Laden]], renamed the organization, "Binladen Brothers for Contracting and Industry" and continued to expand their late father's company until it employed more than 40,000 people. Salem bin Laden was killed in the United States in 1988 when his ultralight aircraft collided with power lines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rags to riches story of the bin Laden family is woven with tragedy|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/01/rags-to-riches-story-of-the-bin-laden-family-is-woven-with-tragedy|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-06|first = Jason|last = Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the Bin Laden family have moved away from Saudi Arabia and settled in Europe and the US.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In May 1990, the company was renamed the Saudi Binladin Group under the leadership of [[Bakr bin Laden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden|url = http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=mohammed_bin_awad_bin_laden_1|website = www.historycommons.org|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Saudi Binladin Group]] as it is now known, is involved in construction, engineering, manufacturing, and telecommunications. Construction projects include airports, housing complexes, tunnels, and bridges. The group is also involved in city planning and real estate development. The Saudi Binladin Group is Egypt's largest private foreign company and negotiated with the Lebanese government to rebuild part of central Beirut under a US $50 million contract.

In 2009, the Bin Laden family was listed as the 5th wealthiest Saudi family by [[Forbes|Forbes magazine]], with a reported net worth of $7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Five Richest Saudis|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2009/08/31/the-five-richest-saudis/|website = WSJ Blogs - The Wealth Report|date = 2009-08-31|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the MIBC took place on the Presnenskaya Embankment next to the [[Moskva River]], approximately {{convert|4|km|mi|sp=us}} west of [[Red Square]], and just east of the Third Ring Road. The project occupies an area of 60 hectares,&lt;ref name="Citynext.ru"/&gt; with the territory chosen being the only area in central Moscow that can accommodate such a project.

Europe's second tallest building, the [[Federation Tower]], is in the  MIBC. The complex also includes the [[OKO Tower|third-tallest]], [[Mercury City Tower|fourth-tallest]], [[Eurasia (building)|sixth-tallest]], [[City of Capitals|seventh-tallest]], and [[Naberezhnaya Tower|eighth-tallest]] buildings in [[Europe]]. By 2016 twelve of twenty-three planned facilities of MIBC were already built, seven buildings are in construction and four are in the design stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tekstilschiky.mos.ru/presscenter/news/detail/3324736.html|title=«Москва-Сити» к 2018 году развернется на 100 га|website=tekstilschiky.mos.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

== History ==
Before construction began, the area had been an old [[stone quarry]] where most of the buildings were old factories and industrial complexes that had been closed or abandoned. In order to manage the project, a public company, CITY, was created in 1992 in order to oversee the initial creation and development of Moscow City as well as its subsequent usage. CITY is also a general contractor and both landlord and leaser. Overall responsibility for the [[Architectural plan|architectural planning]] and design of Moscow City belongs to the architectural studio No. 6, which is a part of the large Moscow practice Mosproject-2 named after Mikhail Vasilyevich Posokhin. This group, headed by Gennady Lvovich Sirota, who is officially the Chief Architect of Moscow City, is in charge of overseeing the design of the complex as a whole and agreeing the details of individual projects. Each building lot has its own investor and architect. By 2014 the volume of investments in Moscow City was approximately $12 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2014/03/18/25-let-spustya|title=Анатомия проекта: 25 лет спустя|first=|last=Ведомости|date=18 March 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
Established in the spring of 1992, the [[Open joint-stock company|PJSC]] City Company manages the creation and development of the MIBC. On December 30, 1994, the [[Government of Moscow]] authorized PJSC City to act as the managing company for the MIBC and to negotiate with third parties to help develop the MIBC. As of February 2014, the company is owned by the Solvers Group led by Oleg Malis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2014/06/16/poslednie-kogo-zdes-zhdali-lyudi-kotorye-pridut-navodit|title="Последние, кого здесь ждали, - люди, которые придут наводить порядок", - Олег Малис, управляющий партнер группы Solvers|last=Ведомости|date=2014-06-16|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citymoscow.ru/about|title=ПАО «СИТИ» {{!}} Управляющая компания ММДЦ «Москва-Сити»|website=citymoscow.ru|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==

=== Pedestrian ===
The [[Bagration Bridge]] is a pedestrian bridge that goes over the [[Moskva River]]. It connects Tower 2000 and the rest of the MIBC complex.

=== Road ===
To correspond with the growing MIBC, new highways and interchanges were built to connect the MIBC with the main transport arteries of the city. These projects include the ten-lane Dorogomilovsky Bridge of the [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Ring Road]] over the [[Moskva River]], the Third Ring Road interchange with [[Kutuzovsky Prospekt|Kutuzovsky Avenue]], and the extension of the Presnenskaya Embankment. Existing roads were reconstructed and rearranged.

Major thoroughfares that connect to the MIBC are the [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Ring Road]], 3rd Magistralnaya street, and the Presnenskaya Embankment.

=== Rapid transit ===
The MIBC is served by several [[Moscow Metro|metro]] stations, two of which are named Delovoy Tsentr ([[Russian language|Russian]] for business district). Stations [[Vystavochnaya]] (formerly known as Delovoy Tsentr) and [[Mezhdunarodnaya (Moscow Metro)|Mezhdunarodnaya]] opened on the [[Filyovskaya Line]] in 2005 and 2006 respectively, [[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko–Solntsevskaya line)|Delovoy Tsentr]] on the [[Kalininsko–Solntsevskaya line|Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line]] in 2014, and a [[Delovoy Tsentr (Bolshaya Koltsevaya line)|second Delovoy Tsentr]] on the [[Bolshaya Koltsevaya line]] in 2017.

The MIBC in addition is served by [[Moscow Central Circle]] with the station also named [[Delovoy Tsentr (Moscow Central Circle)|Delovoy Tsentr]] which opened in 2016. There are also plans to install a high-speed rail system between the MIBC and [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]].

The '''National Black Chamber of Commerce''' ('''NBCC''') was incorporated as ''The National Black Chamber of Commerce, Inc.'', in 1993.  It is a [[nonprofit]], [[nonpartisan]], [[nonsectarian]] [[organization]] dedicated to the economic [[empowerment]] of [[African American]] communities.  Additionally, the organization indicates that it represents the views of its members regarding economic and political policy issues; domestically and internationally.  It is organized as a [[501(c)]] corporation and has at least 190 chapters within the United States.  The NBCC also has international chapters in the [[Bahamas]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Ghana]] and [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  As with all [[Chamber of Commerce|Chambers of Commerce]], affiliate branches are committed to carrying out the goals of the main Chamber within their areas.

However, the organization is largely funded by non-African American businesses on behalf of whose interests it often lobbies, such as the [[Fossil fuel industry|fossil fuel]], [[telecommunications]],&lt;ref name="Davies2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Ken|title=National Black Chamber of Commerce: Fossil Funders Revealed|url=http://www.climateinvestigations.org/national-black-chamber-of-commerce-fossil-funders-revealed|website=Climate Investigations Center|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kushnick2007"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kushnick|first1=Bruce|title=Verizon, AT&amp;T and the manipulation of public opinion|url=http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=background.view&amp;backgroundid=167|website=Nieman Watchdog|publisher=Nieman Foundation at Harvard University|accessdate=27 March 2017|date=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dampier2009"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dampier|first1=Philip|title=Special Report — Astroturf Overload – Broadband for America = One Giant Industry Front Group|url=http://stopthecap.com/2009/10/02/special-report-astroturf-overload-broadband-for-america-one-giant-industry-front-group/|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tobacco industry|tobacco industries]],&lt;ref name="Lorber2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lorber|first1=Janie|title=Some Question Black Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/Black-Chamber-of-Commerce-Questions-205755-1.html|accessdate=27 March 2017|work=[[Roll Call]]|date=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YergerMalone"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yerger VB, Malone RE|title=African American leadership groups: smoking with the enemy|journal=Tobacco Control|date=December 2002|volume=11|issue=4|pages=336–45|pmid=12432159|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/11/4/336.long|doi=10.1136/tc.11.4.336|pmc=1747674}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has sometimes been accused of being a [[front group]].&lt;ref name="Dampier2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alvarado2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alvarado|first1=Francisco|title=National Black Chamber of Commerce, Solar Energy Critic, Rakes in Cash From Polluters|url=http://fcir.org/2015/08/13/national-black-chamber-of-commerce-solar-energy-critic-rakes-in-cash-from-polluters/|accessdate=27 March 2017|work=Florida Center for Investigative Reporting|date=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The NBCC is a very young national organization when compared to others such as the [[NAACP]] and the [[Congress on Racial Equality]] (CORE). NBCC was founded in 1993 by Harry C. Alford and his wife Kay DeBow.&lt;ref name=fcir20150813/&gt; Alford, who serves as the first President and CEO, is also a Board member of the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df           = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview reported in ''[[Human Events]]'', Mr. Alford identifies with the [[Booker T. Washington]] approach to African American self empowerment and sees the approach of [[W.E.B. Du Bois]] and the [[NAACP]] (whom he calls ''enemies of Washington'') as primarily political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Mission and strategic goals==
The stated mission of the NBCC is to "economically empower and sustain African American communities through entrepreneurship and capitalistic activity within the United States and via interaction with the Black [[Diaspora]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
 | url=http://www.nationalbcc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37&amp;Itemid=48
 | title=National Black Chamber of Commerce - Strategic Plan
 | accessdate=2007-02-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It claims to be the first major African American organization to focus on economic empowerment.

The NBCC works to fulfill its mission by implementing the following goals:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
*Increase [[business development]] and [[economic growth]] within the African American community via [[procurement]], access to [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[international trade]].
*Secure [[sponsorship]] for the [[funding]] and guidance of NBCC programs.
*Educate and train members of the African American community regarding business development and their purpose to benefit society.
*Provide [[technical support]] to affiliate chapters.

===Business development===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
The NBCC reaches 100,000 Black owned businesses. There are 1 million Black owned businesses in the United States. Black businesses account for over $100 billion in annual sales. African Americans have over $800 billion in expendable income each year according to the US Bureau of Census.

===Funding===

The NBCC "is funded primarily by fossil fuel energy companies, including [[Koch Industries]] and ExxonMobil," according to a 2015 analysis by the [[Florida Center for Investigative Reporting]].&lt;ref name=fcir20150813&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Florida Center for Investigative Reporting]] |title=National Black Chamber of Commerce, Solar Energy Critic, Rakes in Cash From Polluters |date=August 13, 2015 |first=Francisco |last=Alvarado |url=http://fcir.org/2015/08/13/national-black-chamber-of-commerce-solar-energy-critic-rakes-in-cash-from-polluters/ |accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exxon Mobil]] includes the NBCC on its 2004 list of contributions and community investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

NBCC has also received funding from and lobbied on behalf of the telecommunications industry. [[Verizon]] was listed as a funder of NBCC,&lt;ref name="Kushnick2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dampier2009"/&gt; which has in turn lobbied the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) against [[net neutrality]] and other telecommunications industry regulations.&lt;ref name="Kushnick2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dampier2009"/&gt; NBCC also voiced support for a proposed merger between [[AT&amp;T]] and [[T-Mobile]].&lt;ref name="Lorber2011"/&gt;

==Positions==

The NBCC takes positions on federal and state legislation and issues that may affect its goals.

The NBCC "has been a staunch ally of utility and fossil fuel companies for nearly a quarter century," according to the [[Florida Center for Investigative Reporting]].&lt;ref name=fcir20150813/&gt;

* In 1998, Alford testified before the [[United States Congress]] that the [[Kyoto Protocol]] would harm minority-owned small businesses.&lt;ref name=fcir20150813/&gt;
* In testimony submitted to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]] regarding Senate Bill S.625, the NBCC stated that it opposes increased the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulation of tobacco.  The reason for its opposition is that the regulation would impose fees affecting small tobacco retailing and distribution businesses in the U.S., many of which are owned by [[Black American]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*In public comments regarding the [[Microsoft antitrust case]], the NBCC along with the Telecommunications Research and Action Center and the National [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] Chamber of Commerce indicated that the case settlement was inadequate in terms of consumer protection and that additional remedies were required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The purpose of the program, which began in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = National Core Indicators: Ten Years of Collaborative Performance Measurement. Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|url = http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1352/0047-6765%25282007%252945%255B354%253ANCITYO%255D2.0.CO%253B2?journalCode=mere|doi = 10.1352/0047-6765(2007)45[354:ncityo]2.0.co;2 | volume=45|journal=Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|pages=354–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to support NASDDDS member agencies (state [[Developmental disability|developmental disabilities]] agencies) to gather a standard set of [[Performance measurement|performance]] and outcome measures that can be used to track their own performance over time, to compare results across states, and to establish national [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]].

The primary aim of NCI is to collect and maintain valid and reliable data about the performance of public developmental disabilities [[Service system|service systems]]. NCI states and project partners use NCI data not only to improve practice at the state level but also to add knowledge to the field, to influence state and national policy, and to inform strategic planning initiatives for NASDDDS.

Through participation in the program, NCI states make a commitment to share information with [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholders]] so that data can be used for policy change and [[Quality management|quality improvement]]. To that end, the National Core Indicators website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Welcome {{!}} National Core Indicators|url = http://www.nationalcoreindicators.org|website = www.nationalcoreindicators.org|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides public access to NCI data and current information about how the results are being used at the state and national levels to support policy, [[research]], and [[advocacy]] efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJi89H2oyAY|title = YouTube Video: Why is the NCI important?|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Allen|first = Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The National Core Indicators framework ==
The NCI framework comprises an '''Adult Consumer Survey''', three family [[Survey methodology|surveys]] ('''The''' '''Adult Family Survey''', '''The''' '''Family/Guardian Survey''' and '''The''' '''Children/Family Survey''') and '''The''' '''Staff Stability Survey'''.

=== The Adult Consumer Survey ===
'''The Adult Consumer Survey''' is completed with a minimum of 400 individuals (per participating state) who are 18 years of age or older and receiving at least one paid service in addition to [[Case management (US health system)|case management]]. There are over 100 key outcome indicators in the survey that are designed to gather valid and reliable data across five broad domains: individual outcomes; family outcomes; health, welfare and rights; staff stability; and system performance.  The survey has three components; background data, and two interview sections.  The background data is most frequently completed by service coordinators prior to the face-to-face survey and includes information about general demographics; where people live, work, health information, etc.  The interview part of the survey must be conducted face to face with the individual receiving services.  The first section can only be answered by the individual. The second section of the survey may be completed by a proxy if the interviewer determines the individual cannot answer for him or herself or if the individual does not want to respond&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Responsiveness to Self-Report Interview Questions by Adults With Intellectual and Developmental Disability|url = http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1352/1934-9556-53.3.163|journal = Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|date = 2015-06-01|issn = 1934-9491|pages = 163–181|volume = 53|issue = 3|doi = 10.1352/1934-9556-53.3.163|first = Roger J.|last = Stancliffe|first2 = Renáta|last2 = Tichá|first3 = Sheryl A.|last3 = Larson|first4 = Amy S.|last4 = Hewitt|first5 = Derek|last5 = Nord}}&lt;/ref&gt; the NCI team provides training for interviewers who administer the survey.   Completed surveys are entered using a secure online data entry system designed by HSRI.

=== The National Core Indicator Family Surveys ===

==== The Adult Family Survey ====
The Adult Family Survey is completed by a minimum of 400 respondents (per participating state) who have an adult family member with I/DD living in the family home.  This survey is mailed out to families to be completed.  Returned survey information is entered into a secure on-line data entry system designed and managed by HSRI.  States report response rates of between 35%- 40%.

==== The Family/Guardian Survey ====
The Family/Guardian Survey is completed with a minimum of 400 respondents (per participating state) who have an adult family member with I/DD living outside the family home.  This survey is mailed out to families to be completed. Returned survey information is entered into a secure on-line data entry system designed and managed by HSRI.  States report response rates of between 35%- 40%.

==== The Children/Family Survey ====
The Children/Family Survey is completed with a minimum of 400 respondents (per participating state) who have a child family member with I/DD living in the family home.  This survey is mailed out to families to be completed. Returned survey information is entered into a secure on-line data entry system designed and managed by HSRI. States report response rates of between 35%- 40%.

==== The Staff Stability Survey ====
The Staff Stability Survey is completed by all  provider agencies (within participating states) supporting adults with I/DD in residential, employment, day services and other in-home or community inclusion programs.  The survey is intended to capture information about the direct support professional (DSP) workforce such as [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]], vacancy rates, wages, types of services provided, and benefits offered. Each state provides HSRI with agency emails and the provider agencies respond directly into HSRI's on-line data entry system.

== Reports and publications ==
Data from NCI surveys are aggregated and analyzed in reports produced yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reports {{!}} National Core Indicators|url = http://www.nationalcoreindicators.org/resources/reports/|website = www.nationalcoreindicators.org|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These data are used to support state efforts to strengthen long term care [[policy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Data Measurement Project: National Core Indicators|url = http://www.acl.gov/Programs/AIDD/Program_Resource_Search/Resources/DataMeasurement_NationalCore.aspx|website = www.acl.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; inform the conduct of quality assurance activities, and compare performance with national norms. Additionally, NCI data have been used as the basis of data briefs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Data Briefs {{!}} National Core Indicators|url = http://www.nationalcoreindicators.org/resources/data-briefs/|website = www.nationalcoreindicators.org|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; on specific areas of interest such as employment, dual diagnosis, self-directed services, and autism spectrum disorders, and the results of analyses of the multi-state dataset have been published in academic research journals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Publications {{!}} National Core Indicators|url = http://www.nationalcoreindicators.org/resources/publications/|website = www.nationalcoreindicators.org|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presented at conferences. NCI has also been cited as a "Resource on [[Autism]]" by [[NBC News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Resources on Autism|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/resources-autism-n340291|website = NBC News|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCI indicators contribute to the calculation of state rankings in [[United Cerebral Palsy]]'s report ''The Case for Inclusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Case for Inclusion 2015|url = http://cfi.ucp.org/|website = cfi.ucp.org|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the National Core Indicators surveys also provide a rich source of data on demographics, personal characteristics, work status, and services received. These data, together with NCI data on outcomes, have been used in many [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] research articles and presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Health disparities among adults with developmental disabilities, adults with other disabilities, and adults not reporting disability in North Carolina.|journal = Public Health Reports|date = 2004-01-01|issn = 0033-3549|pmc = 1497651|pmid = 15219799|pages = 418–426|volume = 119|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.phr.2004.05.006|first = Susan M.|last = Havercamp|first2 = Donna|last2 = Scandlin|first3 = Marcia|last3 = Roth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental Health for People With Intellectual Disability: The Impact of Stress and Social Support|url = http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1352/1944-7558-119.6.552|journal = American Journal on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|date = 2014-10-29|issn = 1944-7515|pages = 552–564|volume = 119|issue = 6|doi = 10.1352/1944-7558-119.6.552|first = Haleigh M.|last = Scott|first2 = Susan M.|last2 = Havercamp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Impact of Adulthood Stage and Social-Environmental Context on Body Mass Index and Physical Activity of Individuals With Intellectual Disability|url = http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1352/1934-9556-53.2.100|journal = Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|date = 2015-04-01|issn = 1934-9491|pages = 100–113|volume = 53|issue = 2|doi = 10.1352/1934-9556-53.2.100|first = Kelly|last = Hsieh|first2 = Tamar|last2 = Heller|first3 = Julie|last3 = Bershadsky|first4 = Sarah|last4 = Taub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Empirically Derived Model of Social Outcomes and Predictors for Adults With ASD|url = http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1352/1934-9556-52.4.282|journal = Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|date = 2014-07-25|issn = 1934-9491|pages = 282–295|volume = 52|issue = 4|doi = 10.1352/1934-9556-52.4.282|first = Margaret H.|last = Mehling|first2 = Marc J.|last2 = Tassé}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Place of Residence and Preventive Health Care for Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Services Recipients in 20 States|journal = Public Health Reports|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 0033-3549|pmc = 3407847|pmid = 22942465|pages = 475–485|volume = 127|issue = 5|first = Julie|last = Bershadsky|first2 = Sarah|last2 = Taub|first3 = Joshua|last3 = Engler|first4 = Charles R.|last4 = Moseley|first5 = K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">'''Open Options Corporation''' is a privately owned business strategy consulting company that specializes in applied [[game theory]] and [[business war games]] where there are multiple stakeholders who can all influence the final outcome of a particular situation.

Open Options’ original software development was funded by the [[CIA]] through a company called Waterloo Engineering Software. The software was designed to help the American government better anticipate the collapse of the Soviet Union into many different breakaway republics.&lt;ref name= "Globe and Mail"&gt; https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070125.rmgame0125/BNStory/specialROBmagazine/home &lt;/ref&gt; The software was based on academic research by Dr. Niall Fraser from the [[University of Waterloo]]. Dr. Fraser has written several books on game theory including Mathematical Modeling of Resolutions of Conflict&lt;ref name= "Mathematical Modeling of Resolutions"&gt;  Okada, N, K.W. Hipel, N.M. Fraser and M. Fukushima (1988).

The '''open music model''' is an economic and technological framework for the [[recording industry]] based on research conducted at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. It predicts that the playback of prerecorded music will be regarded as a service rather than as individually sold products, and that the only system for the [[digital distribution]] of music that will be viable against piracy is a subscription-based system supporting [[file sharing]] and free of [[digital rights management]]. The research also indicated that [[United States dollar|US$]]9 per month for unlimited use would be the [[market clearing]] price at that time, but recommended $5 per month as the long-term optimal price.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/8438|title=Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models|author=[[Shuman Ghosemajumder]]|publisher=[[MIT Sloan School of Management]]|date=May 10, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its creation in 2002, a number of its principles have been adopted throughout the recording industry,&lt;ref name=irunway&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-runway.com/blog/on-demand-music-streaming-to-battle-piracy/|title=On-Demand Music Streaming to battle Piracy|author=Gautham Somraj Koorma|publisher=[[iRunway]]|date=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been cited as the basis for the business model of many [[Comparison of on-demand streaming music services|music subscription services]].&lt;ref name=lespresso&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/affari/2014/07/01/news/spotify-il-business-folle-sbarca-a-wall-street-1.171553|title=Spotify, il business folle sbarca a Wall Street|author=Marco Consoli|publisher=[[L'Espresso]]|date=July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazeta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technologie.gazeta.pl/internet/1,104665,18056619,Dla_uzytkownikow_streaming_muzyki_jest_spelnieniem.html|title=Dla użytkowników streaming muzyki jest spełnieniem marzeń, a dla wytwórni – źródłem obaw|author=Karol Kopańko|publisher=[[Gazeta.pl]]|date=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The model asserts that there are five [[necessary and sufficient|necessary]] requirements for a viable commercial music digital distribution network:
{| class="wikitable"
! # !! style="width: 20%;" | Requirement !! Description
|-
| 1 || Open file sharing || users must be free to [[file sharing|share files]] with each other
|-
| 2 || Open file formats || content must be distributed in open formats with no [[digital rights management|DRM]] restrictions
|-
| 3 || Open membership || [[copyright]] holders must be able to freely register to receive payment
|-
| 4 || Open payment || payment should be accepted via multiple means, not a closed system
|-
| 5 || Open competition || multiple such systems must exist which can interoperate, not a designed monopoly
|}The model was proposed by [[Shuman Ghosemajumder]] in his 2002 research paper ''Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models''&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt; at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. The following year, it was publicly referred to as the Open Music Model.&lt;ref name="opensource"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensource.com/life/11/11/drm-graveyard-brief-history-digital-rights-management-music|title=The DRM graveyard: A brief history of digital rights management in music|author=Ruth Suehle|publisher=[[Red Hat]] Magazine|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model suggests changing the way consumers interact with the digital property market: rather than being seen as a good to be purchased from online vendor, music would be treated as a service being provided by the industry, with firms based on the model serving as intermediaries between the music industry and its consumers. The model proposed giving consumers unlimited access to music for the price of [[United States dollar|US$]]5 per month&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt; (as of 2002), based on research showing that this could be a long-term optimal price, expected to bring in a total revenue of over [[United States dollar|US$]]3&amp;nbsp;billion per year.&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt;

The research demonstrated the demand for third-party file sharing programs. Insofar as the interest for a particular piece of digital property is high, and the risk of acquiring the good via illegitimate means is low, people will naturally flock towards third-party services such as [[Napster]] and Morpheus (more recently, [[BitTorrent (protocol)|Bittorrent]] and [[The Pirate Bay]]).&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt;

The research showed that consumers would use file sharing services not primarily due to cost but because of convenience, indicating that services which provided access to the most music would be the most successful.&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt;

== Industry adoption ==
The model predicted the failure of [[digital distribution|online music distribution]] systems based on [[digital rights management]].&lt;ref name=opensource /&gt;&lt;ref name=CollectiveCopyright&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2602197|title=Collective Copyright|author1=Emanuele Lunadei |author2=Christian Valdiva Torres |author3=Erik Cambria |publisher=[[International World Wide Web Conference]] 2014|date=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of the model included that it would not eliminate the issue of piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/120018441/Music-Distribution-Technology-and-the-Value-of-Art-in-Society|title=Music Distribution: Technology and the Value of Art in Society|author=Sungwon Peter Choe|publisher=[[KAIST]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others countered that it was in fact the most viable solution to piracy,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.iplawintheus.com/open-music-model/|title=Open music model|author=Andrew Traub|publisher=US Intellectual Property Law|date=November 25, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101061826/http://www.iplawintheus.com/open-music-model/|archivedate=January 1, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; since piracy was "inevitable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cse.tkk.fi/Datacommunications/Doctoral_dissertations/Lic-Yrjo_Raivio.pdf | title=Mobile Services and the Internet: A Study of Emerging Business Models|author=Yrjö Raivio|publisher=[[Helsinki University of Technology]]|date=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters argued that it offered a superior alternative to the current [[Trade group efforts against file sharing|law-enforcement based methods]] used by the recording industry.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://mujlt.law.muni.cz/storage/1234798737_sb_06_myska.pdf|title=Flat Fee Music|author=Matěj Myška|publisher=[[Masaryk University Journal of Law and Technology]]|date=December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718175953/http://mujlt.law.muni.cz/storage/1234798737_sb_06_myska.pdf|archivedate=July 18, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One startup in Germany, Playment, announced plans to adapt the entire model to a commercial setting as the basis for its business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playment.net/solution/index.html|title=Playment – Our Solution|author=Playment|publisher=playment.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several aspects of the model have been adopted by the recording industry and its partners over time:

{{quote box
|width=40%
|quote=Why would the big four music companies agree to let Apple and others distribute their music without using DRM systems to protect it? The simplest answer is because DRMs haven't worked, and may never work, to halt music piracy.
|source=– [[Steve Jobs]], ''Thoughts on Music''&lt;ref name=stevejobs /&gt; open letter, 2007
}}

* The abolition of digital rights management represented a major shift for the industry. In 2007, [[Steve Jobs]], CEO of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], published a letter&lt;ref name=stevejobs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/kr/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/|title=Thoughts on Music|author=[[Steve Jobs]]|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling for an end to DRM in music. A few months later, [[Amazon.com]] launched a store single individual DRM-free mp3's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/amazon_mp3.php|title=Amazon MP3 Launches DRM-Free Music Store|author=Marshall Kirkpatrick|publisher=[[ReadWriteWeb]]|date=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, iTunes Store abolished DRM on most of its individual tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/137946/2009/01/itunestore.html|title=iTunes Store goes DRM-free|author=Peter Cohen|publisher=[[MacWorld]]|date=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open payment was relatively straightforward to implement, and the [[iTunes Store]] offered gift cards, which could be purchased with cash, from its launch in 2003.
* In 2010, [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] announced a download ability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1627779/rhapsody-streaming-music-mp3-playlists-iphone-itunes-apple-ipad-entertainment|title=Rhapsody First Subscription Service in U.S. to Offer Offline Music on iPhone|author=Kit Eaton|publisher=[[FastCompany]]|date=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their subscribers using [[iPhones]].
* In 2011, Apple launched its [[iTunes Match]] service with a subscription model, supporting file-sharing between a user's own devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erikras.com/2011/11/16/cloud-music-and-itunes-match/|title=Cloud Music and iTunes Match|author=Erik Rasmussen|date=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the subscription price did not include the cost of acquiring content, which would still have to be purchased on a per track basis from the iTunes Store.
* Pricing close to the model's suggested $5 per month price, or its $9 per month market clearing price, has been adopted by many platforms:
** In 2005, [[Yahoo! Music]] was launched at $5 per month with [[digital rights management]].
** In 2011, [[Spotify]] introduced a $5 per month premium subscription in the United States with [[digital rights management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/07/spotify-launches-in-the-u-s-at-last/|title=Spotify Launches in the U.S at Last|author=Charlie Sorrel|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In 2011, [[Microsoft]] [[Zune]] offered a subscription service for music downloads with [[digital rights management]] known as a [[Zune Pass]], at $10 a month.
** in 2012, [[Google Play Music]] launched unlimited music streaming for a subscription price of $9.99 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/06/24/first-look---google-play-music-has-1000s-of-free-music-playlists/29220015/|title=First Look – Google Play Music has 1000s of free music playlists|author=Jefferson Graham|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can upload their own MP3s to the service and download them, but cannot download songs they have not uploaded themselves.
** In 2014, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] added DRM music streaming to their Amazon Prime service.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.windowsobserver.com/2014/06/12/the-gotchas-of-the-amazon-prime-music-service/&lt;/ref&gt;
** In 2015, Apple announced [[Apple Music]], which would offer unlimited streaming of songs encrypted with [[FairPlay]] DRM for a subscription price of $9.99 per month, and compensate artists on the basis of song popularity. Apple reportedly wanted to enter the market with a lower price but was pressured by record labels to adopt a higher subscription fee.&lt;ref name="Verge"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/8/8729481/apple-music-streaming-service-wwdc-15 |accessdate=June 8, 2015 |title=Apple announces its streaming music service, Apple Music |last1=Popper |first1=Ben |last2=Singleton |first2=Micah |date=June 8, 2015 |work=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Z8hZFUn5?url=http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/8/8729481/apple-music-streaming-service-wwdc-15 |archivedate=June 8, 2015 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7967">'''PowerLab''' (before 1998 was referred to as MacLab) is a [[data acquisition]] system developed by [[ADInstruments]] comprising hardware and software and designed for use in life science research&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=adinstruments&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=0 Papers on Google Scholar] Reference to ADInstruments &amp; PowerLab&lt;/ref&gt; and teaching applications. It is commonly used in physiology, pharmacology, biomedical engineering, sports/exercise studies and psychophysiology laboratories to record and analyse physiological signals from human or animal subjects or from isolated organs. The system consists of an input device connected to a [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[Mac OS]] computer using a [[USB]] cable and LabChart software which is supplied with the PowerLab and provides the recording, display and analysis functions. The use of PowerLab and supplementary [[ADInstruments]] products have been demonstrated on the Journal of Visualised Experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jove.com/search.php?q=adinstruments JOVE: Journal of Visualised Experiments] using PowerLab&lt;/ref&gt;

The original '''MacLab''' unit was developed in the late 1980s to run with only [[Macintosh]] computers to perform computer-based [[data acquisition]] and analysis. The MacLab product range was renamed "PowerLab" in 1997 to reflect the cross-platform nature of the system.

The PowerLab system is essentially a peripheral device designed to perform various functions needed for [[data acquisition]], [[signal conditioning]] and pre-processing.&lt;ref name="powerlab" &gt;{{cite web  | title = Pushing Hardware to the Limits. | page  =  | work =   | publisher = Apple Inc Online | year = 2003   | url = https://www.apple.com/au/pr/casestudies/2003/09/adinstruments/scientific5.html| accessdate = 2008-12-22 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Versatile display options and analysis functions are complemented by the ability to export data to other software (such as Microsoft Excel).

* External signals detected are converted into analog electrical signal
* Signals are amplified to amplify signals and filtered to remove unwanted frequencies or noise
* Analog signal is multiplexed to an [[analog to digital converter]]
* The digitized signal is transmitted to the computer using USB connection

==Software for PowerLab==

===LabChart===

Formerly known as Chart. The software functions like a traditional multi-channel [[chart recorder]], [[X–Y plotter|XY plotter]], [[polygraph]] and digital [[voltmeter]]. It is compatible with both Windows and Macintosh operating systems. The software has hardware settings control, performs analysis in real-time and offline without the loss of raw data, procedure automation via editable macros, and multiple block samplings for the recording and settings of different signals within one file.&lt;ref name="macresearch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Showcase: LabChart 6 for Turn-Key Data Acquisition. |page= |work= |publisher=MacResearch |date= |url=http://www.macresearch.org/showcase-labchart-6-turn-key-data-acquisition |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212015955/http://www.macresearch.org/showcase-labchart-6-turn-key-data-acquisition |archivedate=2008-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large specialised add-ons called Modules provide data acquisition and analysis features for specific applications such as ECG, blood pressure, cardiac output, HRV etc. Smaller software plugins provide additional and specialized functionality to LabChart. Extensions perform functions such as file translations into other formats (including PVAN and [[IGOR Pro|Igor Pro]]) and specialist analysis functions (for specific research areas such as spirometry and ventricular pressure). The last version of LabChart6 (version 6.1.3) was released on January 2009.

In April 2009, LabChart 7 was released and incorporates the features of a multi-channel digital oscilloscope that allows recording and averaging of up to sixteen signals in real time. Latest version of LabChart7 is version 7.0.

LabChart 8 is also now available.

===LabTutor===

Software provides a range of hands-on laboratory background for students that includes experimental background &amp; protocols, data acquisition &amp; analysis, and report generation within one interface.&lt;ref name="avreview"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Vazquez, J |title= AV &amp; Software Reviews |journal= The American Biology Teacher|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6958/is_3_70/ai_n28524400/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=173–174 |year=2008 |doi= 10.1662/0002-7685}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inquirybase"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Casotti G. |author2=Rieser-Danner L. |author3=Knabb M.T. |title= Successful implementation of inquiry-based physiology laboratories in undergraduate major and nonmajor courses |journal= Advances in Physiology Education|url=http://advan.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/32/4/286 |volume=32 |pages=286–296 |year=2008 |doi= 10.1152/ADVAN.00100.2007|pmid= 19047505 |issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software and accompanying PowerLab hardware is configured for immediate use with step by step instructions designed to maximize student productivity by applying independent learning techniques to a suite of human and animal physiological experiments.&lt;ref name="avreview" /&gt; Recently, LabAuthor software was released to provide educators the ability to design or edit existing LabTutor experiments and tailor the experiments to suit their practical classes without the need of programming or html skills.

===Scope===

Records and analyzes high frequency signals that are time-locked to a stimulus. The display allows computer screen to act as an [[oscilloscope]] and [[Xy plotter|XY plotter]]

===Limitations===

The PowerLab messaging protocol is not publicly available and there is no public API for traditional programming languages such as C.

While still a young child his family relocated to rural [[Tasmania]] where he grew up on country farm outside of [[Hobart]].  He now resides in [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]], [[Sydney]] with his wife Kate Cawthorn and their three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.bemotivated.com.au/speakers.html | work=Be Motivated website| date= | accessdate=17 November 2010 | title=About Sam Cawthorn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
After completing Matriculation College, Cawthorn worked in sales  at good ol’ Pizza Hut 😍😍 before discovering a passion for helping people.  This inspired him to work as a trainer in Northern Tasmania and lead to his promotion as a training manager.   He later established himself as a Regional Industry Careers Adviser and assisted local industry to identify skill shortages and provide solutions for youth entering the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.bemotivated.com.au/speakers.html | work=Be Motivated website| date= | accessdate=17 November 2010 | title=Sam Before Losing His Arm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cawthorn was also involved in numerous musical theatre productions and established his own music and dance studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= | publisher=The Examiner Newspaper| location=Tasmania | date=15 December 2005 | accessdate= | title=Singers are tuned up for Gigantic Carols Evening}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Near Fatal Car Accident ===
In October 2006, Cawthorn was involved in a head-on collision with a semi-trailer, he was travelling at a speed of 210 km/h and needed to be resuscitated.  He faced severe injuries including the [[amputation]] of his right arm above the elbow and severe damage to his right leg.  Initially distraught by the prospect he may never walk again he maintained a strong mental attitude and conceptualized "Be Motivated" during his nine months of [[physical therapy|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= | publisher=The Examiner Newspaper| location=Tasmania |  first1=Danielle| last1=Blewett| year=2006 | accessdate= | title=Alive and planning for a miracle future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Be Motivated and Motivational Speaking ===
In 2007 Cawthorn established Be Motivated, a program aimed at providing young people with skills to improve their confidence and self-belief in order to attain personal goals while remaining positive when faced with adversity.   To deliver this information he regularly conducts motivational assemblies at schools in Australia and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.youngentrepreneurs.net.au/sam-cawthorn-be-motivated.html | publisher=Young Entrepreneurs Network| location= |  first1= | last1= | date= 30 January 2009 | accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=Sam Cawthorn – Be Motivated}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2009/03/26/2527147.htm | publisher=Conversations with Richard Fidler | location=Brisbane |  first1=Richard | last1=Fidler| date=26 March 2009 | accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=Sam Cawthorn – ABC Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teachings ==
A large part of Cawthorn’s teachings focus on challenging people to discover a purpose and develop goals.  He strongly emphasises the importance of a healthy mental attitude and not allowing excuses to hinder achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.errachidia.biz/clip/video-above elbow amputation-1-dd1WgrkbQuE.html | publisher=Errachidia.org | location= |  first1= | last1= | date=| accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=Sam Cawthorn BOUNCE!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cawthorn also advocates "bouncing forward" after a crisis and not being discouraged by challenges and setbacks which may arise. According to his philosophy, a "Plan B" is unnecessary. He encourages audiences to create environments which leverage collective thinking in order to reach challenging decisions that enable recovery from difficult situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.samcawthorn.com/about/the-speaker/ | publisher=SamCawthorn.com | location= |  first1= | last1= | date=| accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=Thought Leader Topics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.o2speakers.com/speakers/sam-cawthorn.html#twoj_fragment1-2 | publisher=o2 Speakers | location= |  first1= | last1= | date=| accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=Sam Cawthorn - Bounce Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008 Sam Cawthorn was awarded the 2009 Young Australian Year Award for Tasmania.&lt;ref name="aoty" /&gt;

=== Encounter with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd===
Before gathering at The Lodge with fellow Australian of the Year finalists, Cawthorn accepted a dare from his young daughter to play a practical joke upon then [[Australian Prime Minister]], [[Kevin Rudd]].  As the two shook hands, Cawthorn detached his artificial hand from its [[prosthetic]] arm leaving a surprised but highly amused Rudd holding the artificial hand.   The former prime minister later told the reception honouring the finalists he had not recovered from shock and was still "in therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= | publisher=The Daily Telegraph| location=Sydney| date=24 January 2009 | accessdate= |  first1=Alison | last1=Rehn | title=Armless prank stumps Kevin Rudd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2009 Cawthorn travelled to India and held a series of motivational seminars for students and the [[Indian army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cawthornfoundation.org/?page_id=85 | publisher=CawthornFoundation.org | location= |  first1= | last1= | date=| accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=Sonnamucki School Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Create2Change ===
In mid-2009 [[Christian Blind Mission|CBM Australia]] approached Cawthorn to become ambassador for their human rights advocacy movement which creates awareness for people living with disabilities in developing nations.  Under a campaign titled ‘Create2Change’ Cawthorn travelled around India with a film crew to find stories of individuals living with a disability in the most poverty stricken communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cawthornfoundation.org/?p=1 | publisher=CawthornFoundation.org | location= |  first1= | last1= | date=| accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=Create2Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''scheme of arrangement''' (or a "scheme of reconstruction") is a court-approved agreement between a [[corporate law|company]] and its [[shareholder]]s or [[creditor]]s (e.g. lenders or [[debenture]] holders). It may affect mergers and amalgamations and may alter shareholder or creditor rights.

Schemes of arrangement are used to execute arbitrary changes in the structure of a business and thus are used when a reorganisation cannot be achieved by other means. They may be used for rescheduling debt, for takeovers, and for returns of capital, among other purposes.

In the United Kingdom, the relevant provisions for effecting a scheme of arrangement are found in the [[Companies Act 2006]], Part 26 (ss.895-901) and Part 27 (special rules for public companies).

In Australia, the relevant provisions for effecting a scheme of arrangement or reconstruction are located in Part 5.1 of the [[Corporations Act 2001]] (Cth).

In South Africa, the relevant provisions for effecting a scheme of arrangement are found in the Companies Act 2008, No. 71 Of 2008, Sections 114 and 115.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1774">“'''''Société anonyme libanaise''''',” abbreviated '''s.a.l.''', is the [[French language|French]] term for a [[joint stock company]] in [[Lebanon]]. Its main characteristic is the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|intuitus pecuniae|es|3=Intuitu pecuniae}}''—the financial involvement of each associate. 

A joint stock company is an association of funds contributed to by three or more persons. An s.a.l. must have at least three shareholders and capital of at least [[Lebanese lira|LL]]30,000,000. Ownership of shares in the company entitles the shareholder to membership in the company, a right to participate in management and a right to vote. These shares are negotiable or transferable. The liability of each shareholder is limited to the value of the shares held. The Board of Directors must set aside 10% of net profits to create a statutory reserve fund until such time as this reserve fund becomes equivalent to one-third of the capital of the company. A joint stock company must appoint an auditor.

Lebanese law does not provide for direct limitations on foreign interest in joint stock companies. The only indirect limitation is that the Board of Directors must have at least three Lebanese members out of the maximum twelve allowed. Another limitation is confined to joint stock companies whose object is the acquisition of and trading in real estate in Lebanon. In this case, 50 percent of the capital must be held by Lebanese nationals.

'''''The Devil's Miner''''' is a 2005 [[documentary film]] directed by independent film directors Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani. The film follows a fourteen-year-old [[Bolivia]]n boy named Basilio Vargas who along with his twelve-year-old brother Bernardino work in the mines near the city of [[Potosí]]. The film includes many subtle realities of the miner's lives such as the need to chew coca leaves to numb the pain of hunger and the long shifts they work regardless of age.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.netflix.com/Movie/The-Devil-s-Miner/70043419&lt;/ref&gt; The film made its world premier at the [[International Film Festival Rotterdam|Rotterdam film festival]] and its U.S. debut at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]].

The film concentrates on the concerns of local workers who have fear of what they call “Tio” or [[devil]]. In the film, an elder miner claims that over 8 million people have died in the unsafe mines. The workers believe this is because “Tio” controls the mine and that [[Christ]] has no power in the mine. The workers often give [[wikt:offering|offering]]s such as coca leaves, alcohol, cigarettes and perform [[sacrifices]], such as slaughtering a llama and applying its blood to the mine entrance to appease a makeshift statue of "Tio". Each mine has its own Tio which all of the workers pray to upon entering so that they may find a good vein of silver and so that they may be granted protection from explosions, toxic gas, silicosis, and falling rocks.The local [[Catholic]] priest is unable to tame these fears of “Tio” although the workers often pray at the [[Church (building)|church]] before entering the mine,upon observing the miners attending Mass, the local priest said that when he looked into the face of the miners he "saw Christ dying". The irony which is upon these people is one of great sorrow. They worship both God and the Devil, Light and Dark, The God of the world, and the god of the earthen mine below. 

As of 2014, Basilio is studying tourism, working in the mines three nights a week, and working as a tour guide in the mines. Bernardino, now married, still works in the mines full-time whilst studying in the evenings. The boys no longer live on the mountain, however their mother remains in the same house.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/devilsminer/update.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
is a book written by former [[Brigham Young University]] lecturer [[Jeffrey Nielsen]], who teaches philosophy at [[Westminster College, Salt Lake City]], Utah and at [[Utah Valley University]], [[Orem, Utah]].

== Basis ==
The book is based on Neilsen's concept of the "'''myth of leadership'''."

Professor Nielsen argues that we frequently use the words "[[leader]]" and "[[leadership]]" metaphorically to refer to some talent or skill that is needed, which use does little damage as well as little good. However he adds, when we use the words formally to designate officially someone as a leader or some position as involving leadership, then we create unhealthy and deleterious [[organization]]al and community [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s.

As soon as we formally designate a leader, Nielsen argues, we set up within an organization a [[dichotomy]]: two groups - to one we assign duties, and to the other we assign privileges. We confer unique and powerful privileges upon the few leaders and specify numerous duties to be obeyed by the many [[Follower (disambiguation)|follower]]s. The followers, the vast majority, are consigned to an inferior status, even to be [[sacrifice]]d, if needs be, to preserve and protect the power and privilege of those designated as leaders – whether through layoffs, war, tax cuts, or even welfare reform. To the leaders, the [[élite]] few, we grant the rights and privileges to command and control the vast resources, most importantly the information and decision-making [[power (social and political)|power]]. There are no exceptions to this split between the privileged few and the burdened many – it will occur, Nielsen believes, in any and every organization that formally designates individuals as leaders and positions as leadership positions.

Just as soon as we call someone the leader, Nielsen says, we have created a [[social status|rank]]-based context that defines power as “power-over", even to the extent of coercion and manipulation; [[authority]] as the right to exercise power in a [[command and control (disambiguation)|command-and-control]] manner; and [[hierarchy]] as the means of transmission of authority from the top down through privileged [[delegation]]. There is no way to avoid this - it is inevitable. Professor Nielsen relates it to what [[Michel Foucault]] might have called the [[discourse]] formation of the concept of leadership, and it is what [[Stephen Austin (disambiguation)|Stephen Austin]] would call the [[speech act]] of leader.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The myth of leadership creates a rank-based [[culture]] where the leaders possess special privilege to speak and the followers possess an unreciprocated obligation to listen; where the leaders are entitled to monopolize information, control decision-making, and command obedience, thus establishing a culture of secrecy and inauthentic communication. The myth of leadership justifies an organization, whether political, religious, or corporate where:
* the leader speaks and the followers listen
* the leader controls information and the followers can only guess
* the leader knows and the followers only have opinions
* the leader decides and the followers just do what they're told
* the leader directs resources and the followers must make do with less and less
* the leader commands and the followers obey
* the leader is superior and the followers are inferior

# openness with information – as opposed to the secrecy allowed and considered legitimate with leaders and leadership.
# transparency in the decision-making process, which requires greater participation of all affected parties – as opposed to the top-down and behind closed door decision-making allowed and considered legitimate with leaders and leadership.
# cooperation and sharing of [[management]] roles and responsibilities, which requires the exercise of power-in-common – as opposed to the command and control nature of the exercise of power-over allowed and considered legitimate with leaders and leadership.
# commitment to peer deliberation as the legitimate exercise of authority – as opposed to the rank-based exercise of coercive, manipulative, or even persuasive authority allowed and considered legitimate with leaders and leadership.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2496">{{Competition law}}
A '''vertical agreement''' is a term used in [[competition law]] to denote agreements between firms at different levels of the supply chain. For instance, a manufacturer of consumer electronics might have a vertical agreement with a retailer according to which the latter would promote their products in return for lower prices. [[Franchising]] is a form of vertical agreement, and under [[European Union competition law]] this falls within the scope of Article 101.&lt;ref&gt;''Consten v. Grundig&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a vertical agreement actually restricts competition and whether in that case the benefits [[wikt:outweigh|outweigh]] the anti-[[competitive]] effects will often depend on the market structure.

==EU competition law: block exemptions for vertical agreements==
Vertical agreements that fulfil the conditions for exemption and do not contain any so-called "hardcore restrictions" of competition are exempted from the prohibition in Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union by Regulation 330/2010 &lt;ref&gt;''[[European Union regulation|Commission Regulation]] ([[European Union|EU]]) 330/2010 on the application of Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices&lt;/ref&gt;
. The main exception is agreements for motor vehicle distribution, which remain subject to Regulation 1400/2002 &lt;ref&gt;''[[European Union regulation|Commission Regulation]] ([[European Community|EC]]) NO 1400/2002 of 31 July 2002 on the application of Article 81(3) of the Treaty to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices in the [[motor vehicle]] [[List of recognized economic sectors|sector]]&lt;/ref&gt; until 31 May 2013, pursuant to a three-year extension granted in Regulation 461/2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Union regulation|Commission Regulation]] ([[European Union|EU]]) 461/2010 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices in the motor vehicle sector&lt;/ref&gt; Although this latter regulation applies Regulation 330/2010 to agreements for the repair of motor vehicles and for the distribution of spare parts as of 1 June 2013, it also supplements Regulation 330 with three additional "hardcore" clauses

The [[United States|American]] '''Widener family''' of [[Peter Arrell Brown Widener]] (1834&amp;ndash;1915) and his wife Hannah Josephine Dunton (1836&amp;ndash;1896) were from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and were one of the wealthiest families in the United States. In 1883 Widener was part of the founding partnership of the [[Philadelphia Traction Company]] and used the great wealth accumulated from that business to become a founding organizer of [[U.S. Steel]] and the [[American Tobacco Company]].{{citation needed|date = March 2012}}

The legacy of Peter and Hannah Widener includes the [[Widener Library]] at [[Harvard University]] but even more important was the implanting of a social conscience in their children that has been passed down from generation to generation. While the family fortune dwindled over time through [[Estate tax in the United States|estate taxes]] and the natural division and redivision by inheritors, many of their 21st century descendants continue to be involved in charitable works. [[Widener University]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], is named after the Wideners as a result of a very large contribution the family made when the college was transitioning from an all-male military college to a co-educational civilian university.{{citation needed|date = March 2012}}

Peter and Hannah Widener built [[Lynnewood Hall]] in [[Elkins Park, Pennsylvania]], a 110-room [[Georgian architecture|Georgian-style]] mansion designed by [[Horace Trumbauer]] where they assembled one of the most valuable [[art]] collections in the country. Left a vast fortune, their offspring became one of the most prominent factors in American [[Thoroughbred horse race|Thoroughbred horse racing]] history as well as founding benefactors of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Widener University]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], and the [[Widener School for Crippled Children]].{{citation needed|date = March 2012}}

The descendants of Peter Arrell Brown Widener and Hannah Josephine Dunton include:
* [[George Dunton Widener]] (1861-1912)
* [[Joseph E. Widener]] (1871-1943)
* [[Harry Elkins Widener]] (1885-1912)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5310">'''Wrecking''' ({{lang-ru|вредительство}} or ''vreditel'stvo'', lit. "inflicting damage", "harming"), was a crime specified in the criminal code of the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] era. It is often translated as "[[sabotage]]"; however, "wrecking", "diversionist acts", and "counter-revolutionary sabotage" were distinct sub-articles of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]] (58-7, 58-9, and 58-14 respectively), and the meaning of "wrecking" is closer to "undermining".

These three categories were distinguished in the following way:

*''Diversions'' were acts of immediate infliction of physical damage on state and cooperative property.
*''Wrecking'' was deliberate acts aimed against normal functioning of state and cooperative organisations, such as giving deliberately wrong commands.
*''Sabotage'' was non-execution, or careless execution, of one's duties.

As applied in practice, "wrecking" and "sabotage" referred to any action which negatively affected the economy, including failing to meet unrealistic economic targets, allegedly causing poor morale among subordinates (e.g. by complaining about conditions of work), lack of effort, or other incompetence. Thus, it referred to economic or industrial sabotage in the very broadest sense. The definition of sabotage was interpreted [[Dialectics|dialectically]] and indirectly, so any form of non-compliance with Party directives could have been considered a 'sabotage'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cogs in the Wheel: The Formation of Soviet Man|last = Heller|first = Mikhail|publisher = Alfred A.

=="Wrecking" in the Soviet Census of 1937==
One of the [[show trial]]s involving charges of "wrecking" was that of official coordinators of the [[Soviet Census (1937)|1937 Soviet Census]]. The census was organised with great expectations from the government that it would confirm the superiority of the Soviet economic and social model, with Stalin publicly declaring in 1934 that the Soviet Union was gaining at least 3 million citizens per year. The census questions and procedure were prepared for several years by a commission of professional statisticians and demographers, but then significantly changed by Stalin and other members of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] to better match their political goals &amp;ndash; the collection phase of the census was shortened and the procedures simplified. The results obtained from the census were at least 8 million people short of the expected outcome and immediately classified. The formal organizers were accused of "wrecking" and sent to camps, and the shortage was officially presented as caused by their negligence and intentional sabotage. The actual measurement error, as estimated by statisticians in the 1990s, did not exceed 1.5% and such a disappointing result was caused by the huge loss of life that occurred during [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]], the [[Soviet famine of 1932-1933|Famine of 1932&amp;ndash;1933]], including in the Ukraine ([[Holodomor]]), and the mortality rates in the [[Gulag]].&lt;ref name=Volkov&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/knigi/polka/gold_fund08.html A.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;Volkov ''Census of 1937 Facts and Fictions''] originally published in Перепись населения СССР 1937 года.

[[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], in his historical account of the prison camps of the Soviet Union, ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'', describes [[Nikolai von Meck]] (son of [[Karl Otto Georg von Meck|Karl]] and [[Nadezhda von Meck]], patroness of [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]), an engineer who advised heavier-than-average loads being placed on [[freight trains]] for the betterment of the economy. He was accused of being a wrecker and shot &amp;ndash; his supposed crime being having overloaded the trains for the purpose of wearing out the rails faster.&lt;ref&gt;Solzhenitsyn, Aleksandr I.

In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s 2015 [[alternate history]] novel ''[[Joe Steele (novel)|Joe Steele]]'', set in a timeline where Stalin (known as "Joe Steele") was born in the United States and becomes [[President of the United States|President]] in 1932, "wrecking" becomes a federal crime, resulting in numerous people being imprisoned and in some cases executed for it, with the equivalent of Gulags being located in [[Wyoming]], [[Colorado]], [[Montana]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Dakota]], and the [[Territory of Alaska]].
