In [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]] "adiaphora" represents indifference to the vicissitudes of life.

In [[Pyrrhonism]], "adiaphora" indicates things which cannot be logically differentiated. Unlike in Stoicism, the term has no specific connection to morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pyrrho/|title=Pyrrho|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Stoicism]] "adiaphora" indicates actions that [[morality]] neither mandates nor forbids. In the context of Stoicism "adiaphora" is usually translated as "indifferents."

In [[Christianity]], "adiaphora" are matters not regarded as essential to [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], but nevertheless as permissible for Christians or allowed in church. What is specifically considered adiaphora depends on the specific [[Christian theology|theology]] in view.

==Cynicism==
The Cynics cultivate adiaphora, by which they meant indifference to the vicissitudes of life, through ascetic practices which help one become free from influences – such as wealth, fame, and power – that have no value in Nature. Examples include Diogenes' practice of living in a tub and walking barefoot in winter.

==Pyrrhonism==
{{See also|Non-essentialism}}
[[Pyrrho]] claimed that all ''pragmata'' (matters, affairs, questions, topics) are ''adiaphora'' (not differentiable, not clearly definable, negating Aristotle's use of "diaphora"), ''astathmēta'' (unstable, unbalanced, unmeasurable), and ''anepikrita'' (unjudgeable, undecidable). Therefore, neither our senses nor our beliefs and theories are able to identify truth or falsehood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pyrrho/#AriPas|title=Pyrrho|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stoicism==
The Stoics distinguish all the objects of human pursuit into three classes: good, bad, and adiaphora (indifferent). [[Virtue]], [[wisdom]], [[justice]], [[Temperance movement|temperance]], and the like, are denominated [[good and evil|good; their opposites were bad]]. Besides these there are many other objects of pursuit such as [[wealth]], [[celebrity|fame]], etc. of themselves neither good nor bad. These are thought therefore in ethics to occupy neutral territory, and are denominated "adiaphora". This distinction amounts practically to an exclusion of the adiaphora from the field of morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The New American Cyclopaedia | year = 1859 | page = 124}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==

===Lutheranism===
{{see also|Law and Gospel|Antinomianism#Lutheranism}}
The issue of what constituted ''adiaphora'' became a major dispute during the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In 1548, two years after the death of [[Martin Luther]], the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] tried to unite Catholics and Protestants in his realm with a law called the [[Augsburg Interim]]. This law was rejected by [[Philipp Melanchthon]], on the account that it did not ensure [[justification by faith]] as a fundamental doctrine.  Later he was persuaded to accept a compromise known as the [[Leipzig Interim]], deciding that doctrinal differences not related to justification by faith were ''adiaphora'' or matters of indifference. Melanchthon's compromise was vehemently opposed by [[Matthias Flacius]] and his followers in Magdeburg, who went to the opposite extreme by claiming that adiaphora cease to be adiaphora in a case of scandal and confession. By 1576 both extremes were rejected by the majority of [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] led by [[Martin Chemnitz]] and the formulators of the Formula of Concord.

In 1577, the [[Formula of Concord]] was crafted to settle the question of the nature of genuine ''adiaphora'', which it defined as church rites that are "...neither commanded nor forbidden in the Word of God."&lt;ref name="cycl_Luth"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Adiaphora  | publisher = Concordia Publishing House | work = Christian Cyclopedia | date = 2000 | accessdate = 2018-05-09 | url = http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=a&amp;word=ADIAPHORA |editor-first1=Erwin L.|editor-last1=Lueker|editor-first2=Luther|editor-last2=Poellot|editor-first3=Paul|editor-last3=Jackson }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Concord added believers should not yield even in matters of ''adiaphora'' when these are being forced upon them by the "enemies of God's Word".&lt;ref name="book_TheS"&gt;{{Cite web | work = The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord | title = X. Church Rites, Commonly Called Adiaphora | accessdate = 2018-05-09 | url = http://bookofconcord.org/sd-adiaphora.php?setSidebar=min }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lutheran [[Augsburg Confession]] states that the true unity of the Church it is enough to agree concerning the doctrine of the Gospel and the administration of the Sacraments. Nor is it necessary that human traditions, that is, rites or ceremonies, instituted by men, should be everywhere alike.

===Puritanism===
{{Original research|date=September 2007}}

The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], a confession of faith written by the [[Puritan]]s, which after the [[English Civil War]] was rejected by the [[Anglicans]], distinguishes between elements or acts of [[worship]] (worship proper) and the circumstances of worship. The elements of worship must be limited to what has positive warrant in Scripture, a doctrine known as the [[regulative principle of worship]]. In this framework, the elements of worship have included praise (the words and manner of music), prayer, preaching and teaching from the Bible, the taking of vows, and the two sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper, while the circumstances of worship have included the building and its necessary furniture and the time of day for worship.

The circumstances of worship are considered adiaphora, although they must be done for edification and to promote peace and order (compare {{bibleverse|1|Cor.|14:26–33}}; {{bibleverse ||Rom.|14:19}}).  According to the Westminster Confession 20.2,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_XX.html | publisher = Reformed | title = Westminster Confession of Faith with proofs | chapter = XX}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the conscience is left free in general belief and behavior within the realm of whatever is not "contrary to the Word." However, specifically concerning worship and religious faith, the conscience is free from whatever is "besides" Scripture; that is, it is free to worship and believe only according to whatever has positive warrant in Scripture.

[[Presbyterian]]s who have subscribed to the Westminster Confession, for instance, sometimes considered the questions of [[musical instruments]] and of the singing of [[hymn]]s (as opposed to [[exclusive psalmody]]) not drawn directly from the Bible as related to the elements of worship, not optional circumstances, and for this reason they rejected musical instruments and hymns because they believed they were neither commanded by scripture nor deduced by good and necessary consequence from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Schwertley | first = Brian | url = http://reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/sola.htm | title = Sola Scripture and the Regulative Principles of Worship | journal = Reformed online}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Schwertley | first = Brian | url = http://reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/music.htm | title = Musical Instruments in the Public Worship of God | journal = Reformed online}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Schwertley | first = Brian | url = http://reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/psalm.htm | title = Exclusive Psalmody: A Biblical Defense | journal = Reformed online}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherence to such a position is rare among modern Presbyterians, however.

The Puritan position on worship is thus in line with the common saying regarding adiaphora: "[[In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas|In necessary things, unity; in doubtful things, liberty; in all things, charity]]".

===Latitudinarianism in Anglicanism===
[[Latitudinarianism]] was initially a pejorative term applied to a group of 17th-century English theologians who believed in conforming to official [[Church of England]] practices but who felt that matters of [[doctrine]], [[liturgical]] practice, and [[ecclesiastical]] organization were of relatively little importance. Good examples of the latitudinarian philosophy were found among the [[Cambridge Platonists]]. The latitudinarian Anglicans of the seventeenth century built on [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]]'s position, in ''[[Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity]]'', that God cares about the moral state of the individual soul and that such things as church leadership are "things indifferent". However, they took the position far beyond Hooker's own and extended it to doctrinal matters.

{{The Salvation Army}}
'''Ballington Booth''' (July 28, 1857 &amp;ndash; October 5, 1940) was a British-born American [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] who co-founded [[Volunteers of America]], a Christian [[charitable organization]], and became its first General (1896-1940). He was a former [[officer in The Salvation Army]].

==Early years==
Born in [[Brighouse]], England, Ballington Booth was the second child of [[William Booth|William]] and [[Catherine Booth]], founders of [[The Salvation Army]] in 1878.  As a teenager, he began preaching at Salvation Army open-air meetings, where he would often end by singing and playing his [[concertina]].  He became a Colonel in The Salvation Army at the age of 23, when he was positioned as a Training Officer.  He was later moved to [[Australia]], followed by the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

In 1886, he married Maud Charlesworth, who changed her name to [[Maud Ballington Booth]], and they were assigned to the United States in April of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Famous American Women: A Biographical Dictionary from Colonial Times to the Present|author=[[Robert McHenry]]|publisher=[[Courier Dover Publications]]|year=1983|page=45|isbn=0-486-24523-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9SZh8eDtt0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two became American citizens in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Notable American Women, 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary|volume=3|author=Edward T. James|author2=Janet Wilson James|author3= [[Paul S.

==Volunteers of America==
Although Ballington and Maud Booth played a great part in organizing and structuring The Salvation Army in the United States, the couple left The Salvation Army when the organization reassigned them to positions outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Notable American Philanthropists: Biographies of Giving and Volunteering|author=Robert T. Grimm|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2002|page=38|isbn=1-57356-340-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W3N5POCfIKgC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Ballington Booth began to be in open conflict with his brother [[Bramwell Booth|Bramwell]], who served as [[Chief of the Staff of The Salvation Army]].&lt;ref name=IHC&gt;[http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/0/88c78ae770597106802568cd004a110c?OpenDocument Ballington Booth on 'The Salvation Army International Heritage Centre' website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313224656/http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/0/88c78ae770597106802568cd004a110c?OpenDocument |date=March 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to form their own organization to reach out to the poor and the marginalized of American society.  On March 8, 1896, they started God's American Volunteers, which was soon renamed Volunteers of America.

When the Booths left The Salvation Army they took with them many of the Army's [[Officer in The Salvation Army|officers]] and [[Soldier in The Salvation Army|soldiers]] as well as many of the Army's wealthy American supporters. In fact, in the first year of the Volunteers of America's operation two-thirds of the Volunteer forces were former [[The Salvation Army|Salvationists]]. Many simply replaced the 'S' on their collars with the American flag. Salvation Army songs were adopted with Volunteer words. Their insignia and flag also were loosely based on that of The Salvation Army.&lt;ref name=IHC/&gt;
 
As William Booth was called the [[Generals of The Salvation Army|'General']] of The Salvation Army, so Ballington Booth became the General of Volunteers of America.  In this capacity, he spoke with [[Woodrow Wilson]] about the effect of [[World War I]] on society, but when Booth offered the services of the Volunteers of America to President Wilson, he was politely turned down. At the same time The Salvation Army was allowed to send its personnel with the [[American Expeditionary Force]]. He also spoke with [[Franklin Roosevelt]] about charity efforts throughout the Depression.

Ballington Booth led Volunteers of America for 43 years, and on his death in 1940 he was replaced by his wife Maud Booth as General. He was buried in [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/4740 Booth on the 'Find-A-Grave' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Cross Is Not Greater'' was written by Ballington Booth, both lyric and music, in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.timelesstruths.org/music/The_Cross_Is_Not_Greater/ The Cross Is Not Greater]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barbar Temple''' is an [[archaeological site]] located in the village of [[Barbar, Bahrain|Barbar]], [[Bahrain]], and considered to be part of the [[Dilmun]] culture. The most recent of the three Barbar temples was rediscovered by a [[Denmark|Danish]] archaeological team in 1954. A further two temples were discovered on the site with the oldest dating back to 3000 BC. The temples were built of [[limestone]] blocks, believed to have been carved out from [[Jidda Island]].

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bibby |first1=Geoffrey |title=Looking for Dilmun |date=1969 |publisher=Alfred A Knopf |location=New York |lccn=69010704 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The three temples were built atop one another with the second built approximately 500 years later and the third added between 2100 BC and 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;P Mortensen, 'On the Date of the Barbar Temple in Bahrain, Artibus Asiae, vol. 33, iss. 4, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Mortensen, On the Date of the Barbar Temple, Dilmun, A Journal of Archaeology and History in Bahrain, vol. 6, pp. 4-9, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that the temples were constructed to worship the god ''[[Enki]]'', the god of wisdom and freshwater, and his wife ''Nankhur Sak'' ([[Ninhursag]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nissen|first=Hans|title=Bahrain through the ages : the archaeology|year=1986|publisher=KPI|location=London|isbn=9780710301123|page=352|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hmbc9evgB0C&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;ots=JikKx9GEqL&amp;dq=barbar%20temple%20enki&amp;pg=PA352#v=onepage&amp;q=barbar%20temple%20enki&amp;f=false|edition=1. publ.|author2=Rice, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The temple contains two altars and a natural water spring that is thought to have held spiritual significance for the worshipers. During the excavation of the site many tools, weapons, pottery and small pieces of gold were found which are now on display in the [[Bahrain National Museum]]. The most famous find was a bronze bull's head&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth C. L. During Caspers, The Bull's Head from Barbar Temple II, Bahrain A Contact with Early Dynastic Sumer, East and West, vol. 21, no. 3/4, pp. 217-223 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is on the tentative list of [[UNESCO World Heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelist/1570 UNESCO World Heritage Centre - Barbar Temple]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
The site was discovered by P.V. Glob in 1954. Excavations, by a Danish team
led by Hellmuth Andersen and Peder Mortensen, began that year and 
extended until 1962.&lt;ref&gt;H. Helmuth Andersen and Flemming Hojlund, The Barbar Temples,

==Temple I==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
Temple I, the earliest temple was built on a rectangular platform approximately 25m long and 16 to 18m wide. This was originally constructed on a bed of clean sand, which appears to have been consolidated by a layer of blue clay. The temple was covered by a second layer of clean sand.

At the foundation of Temple I offerings were deposited in the clay core of the temple terrace and they consisted of dozens of clay goblets found in separate groups each containing seven beakers which were broken and buried within the foundations of the terrace. Also copper objects were deposited in small heaps or singly. In the south-western corner of this early temple, steps led down to a square-built well. The central terrace was preserved in its full height, 2 metres, with the remains of trapezoid shrine in the center and adjoining rooms. This first one was built from local Bahraini stone. The cult features the subterranean shrine, the temple well and the oval sacrificial court.

==Temple II==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
Temple II is most liveable still with retaining walls and terraces stiffs, first stage the oval terrace was built in local stone, but after an enlargement it was built in limestone which must have been carried by boat from nearby Jidda island where stone was hewn out by hand and carefully dressed into remarkably neat masonry blocks. The skill with which this task was carried out may be clearly seen in the temple walls and especially around the sacred well. A double circular altar and an offering table stood in the center of the shrine. To the south were three cult stones shaped like the anchors of the merchant ships. Although the central one bore a protruding animal head, like the altars depicted on the seals. A temple treasure lay in the stone frame pit in the north-east comer.The central terrace was crowned by a shrine built of cut stone with stone paving. Smaller buildings clustered around it covering the rest of the terrace. There were no buildings on the outer oval terrace but altars and cult symbols were visible. A plinth with recessed stone cylinder lay to the south and a plinth with three pillars was situated near the north-west wall. A double row of plinths for cult objects lined both sides of the stairs from the upper terrace. On each of these plinths were two square holes lined with bitumen and sheet copper nailed to wood.Here may have stood copper mounted poles with the emblems of gods, so often seen on the stamp seals, or, perhaps, wooden statues. From the central terrace a ceremonial stairway led to the subterranean shrine where water cult ceremonies took place. Halfway down the stair was a portal, and from there the stair was roofed. The rich natural spring which filled the pool probably accounts for the siting of the temple at Barbar. Water poured from a perforated stone jar beside a semicircular stone font at the threshold of a dry chamber near the basin. From the comers of the shrine deep stone built channels led the water to the surrounding fields and gardens

This remarkable underground shrine is interpreted{{by who|date=October 2018}} as a symbolic abzu the abode of Enki, the god of wisdom and of all freshwater.{{fact|date=October 2018}} The abzu was believed to be the abyss or freshwater ocean upon which the whole world rests.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Such temple abzus are mentioned in cuneiform texts in Mesopotamia.{{fact|date=October 2018}} East of the temple lay an oval sacrificial court, connected with a central temple platform by a paved ramp and a staircase. The floor of the court was covered with ashes and the bones of cattle and sheep, presumably sacrificed animals

==Temple III==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
Temple III in use until the early centuries of the second millennium, was larger than its predecessors. Two circular offering tables of finely cut stone with a low altar between them still stand in the middle of the courtyard. Note the three standing stone blocks pierced with a round hold. It is thought that these were tethering points for the sacrificial animals. To give you some idea of size, the third temple's terrace was probably about {{convert|30|m2}}.

'''Belokrinitskoe soglasie''' ({{IPA-ru|bʲɪləkrʲɪˈnʲit͡skəje sɐˈɡlasʲɪje}}) is the largest and one of the most 'temperate' and 'optimistic' denominations among the [[Popovtsy]] [[Old Believers]]. The name derives from the name of the village [[Stary Vovchynets|Belokrinitsa]], where the full hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Oldrite Church was established.

From the end of 1840, when the [[Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy]] was accepted by the '''Belokrinitskoe soglasie''' these two terms became almost synonymous (at least when spoken about [[Old Believers]] in [[Russia]], but not in [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]]). In the 20th century the term '''Belokrinitskoe soglasie''' is synonymous with [[Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church]].

Some confusions may occur when using the term '''Belokrinitskoe soglasie''' in respect to a schism of [[Okruzhniki]] and [[Neokruzhniki]]. From one point of view, both sides of a schism originated from the [[Rogozhskoe cemetery]] administrative system and so both belong to the '''Belokrinitskoe soglasie'''. From the other side, the [[Rogozhskoe cemetery]] priests and authorities were [[Okruzhniki]] almost entirely, so the term '''Belokrinitskoe soglasie''' can sometimes mean [[Okruzhniki]].

{{Tengrianism}}
'''Burkhanism''' or '''Ak Jang''' ({{Lang-alt|Ак јаҥ}}) is a [[new religious movement]] that flourished among the [[Indigenous peoples of Asia|indigenous]] people of [[Russia]]'s [[Gorno-Altai Autonomous Oblast|Gorno Altai]] region (''okrug'') between 1904 and the 1930s. [[Imperial Russia|Czarist Russia]] was suspicious of the movement's potential to stir up native unrest and perhaps involve outside powers.&lt;ref&gt;The most detailed account of the events of 1904-1906 is available in Russian. Sherstova (1986, 2010), Burhanizm [Burkhanism]), Tomsk State University Press. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] authorities ultimately suppressed it for fear of its potential to unify Siberian [[Turkic peoples]] under a common nationalism.

Originally [[millenarian]], [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] and anti-[[shamanic]], the Burkhanist movement gradually lost most of these qualities—becoming increasingly routine, institutionalized (around a hierarchy of oral epic singers), and accommodating itself to the pre-existing Altaian [[folk religion]]. It exists today in several revival forms.

On the whole, the Burkhanist movement was shown to be a syncretistic phenomenon combining elements of ancient pre-Shamanist, Shamanist, [[Lamaism|Lamaist]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] beliefs. According to a Professor of Tomsk State University [[Liudmila Ivanovna Sherstova|L. Sherstova]], it emerged in response to the needs of a new people - the Altai-kizhi or Altaians who sought to distinguish themselves from the neighboring and related tribes and for whom Burkhanism became a religious form of their ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;Sherstova, Burhanism, Chapter 1, 2, 3. Almost three hundred pages of the book leave little doubt about the validity of this conclusion by Sherstova made in 1977-1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the name ==

''Burkhanism'' is the usual English-language scholarly name, which has its origin in the Russian academic usage. One of the Burkhanist deities is Ak-Burkhan, or "White Burkhan." ''Burkhan'' means ''"god"'' or ''"buddha"'' in [[Mongolic languages]], yet Burkhanism is not considered [[Buddhist]], as the term is also used in shamanistic nomenclature. For example, in [[Mongolian Shamanism]], the name of the most sacred mountain, the rumored birthplace and final resting spot of [[Genghis Khan]], is also [[Burkhan Khaldun]].&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Neumann-Hoditz; ''Dschingis Khan'', published by Rowohlt Verlag GmbH; trans. 2005 by Piet de Moor, {{ISBN|90-5466-910-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ak-Burkhan is only one of a [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of deities worshiped by Burkhanists (see list below), but Ak-Burkhan nevertheless provides the name of the religion in Russian, and thence into other languages.

The Altaian name for the religion is ''Ak Jang'' ("White Faith"). "White" refers to its emphasis on the upper world (in the three-world cosmology of the Turkic and Mongolian [[Tengriism]]). Alternatively, the name may also allude to Ak Jang's rejection of animal sacrifices in favor of offerings of horse milk or horse-milk alcohol. "Jang" means authority; faith; custom; law or principle; and canon or rules of ensemble. In more colloquial settings, the term may also be used as a "way of doing things" and is used in reference to religions as well as political systems.&lt;ref&gt;Agnieszka Helmba, 2003. "Contemporary Religious life in the republic of Altai: The Interaction of Buddhism and Shamanism", ''Sibirica'' 3(2):165-182, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
&lt;ref&gt;The most detailed account of what happened in Altai in 1904-1905, including the files of the court trial of Chet Chelpanov and his "colleagues" is only available in Russian. See: Sherstova, Burhanizm, Tomsk (1986, 2010). Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chet Chelpanov.jpg|thumb|Chet Chelpan and his wife Kul]]
In April 1904 Chet Chelpan (or, Chot Chelpanov) and his adopted daughter Chugul Sarok Chandyk reported visions of a rider dressed in white, and riding a white horse. This figure, whom they called Ak-Burkhan ("White Burkhan"), announced the imminent arrival of the mythical messianic hero Oirat Khan who was actually a real historical figure{{mdash}}[[Khoit]]-[[Oirats|Oirat]] prince [[Amursana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://emscat.revues.org/2444|title=Power for the Powerless : Oirot/Amursana Prophecy in Altai and Western Mongolia, 1890s-1920s|work=Millénarismes et innovation rituelle en Asie du Nord|publisher=revues.org|author=Andrei A. Znamenski|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central figure in the research of Burkhanism in the past forty years, however, has demonstrated that Oirot-khan is a mythologized image of the Dzungar past of the people of Altai-kizhi.&lt;ref&gt;Sherstova, Burhanism, Tomsk (1986, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
Chet and Chugul gathered thousands of Altaians for prayer meetings, initially in the Tereng Valley. These were violently suppressed by mobs of Russians, instigated by the Altaian Spiritual Mission, who were afraid of the potential of the competing religion to decrease the Orthodox Christian flock in Altai.&lt;ref&gt;Sherstova, Burhanism, Tomsk (1986, 2010), Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Chet and Chugul were arrested, Chugul was released, and after a prolonged trial Chet was fully exonerated by court and released in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2 of Sherstova, Burhanism, Tomsk (1986, 2010) provides a reconstruction of the court proceedings on the basis of the court files that the author discovered in 1985 in the State Archive of Tomsk Region. The discovery caused a major sensation during the defence of Sherstova's dissertation in the Leningrad branch of the Institute of Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher [[Andrei A. Znamenski]] (see article below) compares the Burkanist movement to other indigenous revitalizing movements around the world, such as the Native American [[Ghost Dance]] or the Melanesian [[Cargo Cult]]. An excruciatingly detailed treatment of the comparisons and comparability of Burkhanism with the Melanesian Cargo Cult, the Mennonites, the Dukhobors of Georgia, the Mariitsy of Nizhnii Novgorod, and many other movements, is provided in Sherstova's dissertation from the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Sherstova, Burhanism, Tomsk State University Press (2010), Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Znamenski says, the prime motivating factor was Altaians' fear of displacement by Russian colonists, [[Russification]], and subjection to [[taxation]] and [[conscription]] on the same basis as Russian peasants.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 2 of Sherstova, Burhanism, Tomsk (1986, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrei Vinogradov]] (thesis linked below) sees Burkhanism as a typical nomadic Turko-Mongolian mobilization pattern—aiming to link families and clans (''seok'') into a steppe empire (which in this case never materialized). The Burkhanists' veneration of heroes from oral epics, he says, serves much the same cultural centralizing function as the veneration of other divine heroes such as [[Epic of King Gesar|Gesar]], [[Epic of Manas|Manas]], or [[Genghis Khan]]. As such it constitutes a major aspect of Turko-Mongolic religion, distinct from shamanism.

After the arrest of Chet and Chugul, [[Tyryi Akemchi]] arose to become the most prominent ''iarlikchi'', and helped organize the movement. Having been exposed to [[Buddhism]] through his years as a translator in Mongolia, Tyryi added a number of Buddhist trappings to Burkhanist ritual, such as bells. Within a decade, most of the Altaian population had joined the new faith.

In 1918 [[Grigory Gurkin|Gregorii Choros-Gurkin]] and other Altaian leaders declared the formation of something called the "Karakorum Regional Committee" (''Karakorumkaia Okruzhnaia Uprava''), with the object of establishing an [[Oyrot Autonomous Oblast|"Oirat Republic"]]. This was intended to include not only Altai but also neighboring republics of Tuva and Khakassia. It was forcibly dissolved with arrival of [[Bolshevik]] power in 1921.

==Deities==
[[File:Oirot.jpg|thumb|''Oirat – Messenger of the White Burkhan'' by [[Nicholas Roerich]].]]
Burkhanism accepts the "three worlds" of Mongolic and Turkic tradition. (These are the upper, middle, and lower worlds—in other words heaven, earth, and the underworld.) However, it rejects worship of traditional deities associated with the underworld. In addition, it imports into worship many figures from Altaian oral epic lore, which were not worshipped in the "shamanic" part of the Altaian religion.

'''Uch Kurbustan'''--"Uch" means "three," while "Kurbustan" comes from the Soghdian "Khormazta" (and thence from the Avestan "[[Ahura Mazda]]"). Thus, a triune God. Though imported from oral epics, Uch Kurbustan is a generalized spirit rather than a hero of stories with a personality. He may be analogous with the Turko-Mongolian High God ''[[Tengri]]'' ("Heaven").

Rather than an import from Buddhism, Christianity, or Turkic Islam, this particular trinity is likely to have been inspired by other triune gods and heroes from Turkic culture (sometimes in the form of a god with three sons). Uch Kurbustan is connected with the following three messianic heroes, also from Altaian oral epic lore:

:: '''Oirat''' or '''Galden-Oirat'''--mythological ancestor of the Western Mongols. A conflation / dim historical memory of a number of real-life Western Mongolian leaders from around the seventeenth century including [[Galdan Tseren]].

:: '''[[Amursana]]'''--a legendary [[Khoit]]-[[Oirats|Oirat]] chieftain who fled Chinese territory for Russian after the 1756 [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] destruction of [[Dzungaria]].

:: '''Shunu''' ("Wolf")--the Altaian version of [[Asena]], the totemic lupine ancestor recognized by various Turkic peoples.

The gods of the upper world, or ''aru tos'' ("pure ancestors"), are considered fragments or eminations of Uch Kurbustan. Burkhanism calls these '''Burkhans'''. Among them are:

:: '''Ak-Burkhan''' ("White Burkhan)--depicted as an old man with white hair, a white coat, and white headgear, who rides a white horse. Possibly analogous to the Mongolian "white old man," [[Tsagan Ebugen]]. A symbol of good fortune.

:: '''Jajyk'''--a formless spirit-mediator, assists with human-divine communication. Vinogradov compares with the Holy Spirit. Altaians distinguished between an Ak-Jajyk ("White Jajyk") who carried messages to the gods of the upper world, and a Sary-Jajyk ("Yellow Jajyk") who did the same for gods of the middle world, and is identified with the hearth.

:: '''Umai'''--the goddess of childbirth and children. Other Turkic lore--but not the Altaian--makes her the consort of the High God Tengri, and thus a primordial mother figure.

:: '''Ot-ene''', the "Mother of Fire"--worshipped before every sacrifice, but especially during one of the three major Burkhanist festivals

Gods of the "middle world"—i.e. the familiar spheres of nature and human affairs—include numerous local spirits, such as spirits associated with mountains (''taika-eezi'') or springs (''arzhans''), or "masters of the game". They may also be associated with particular clans (''seok''). More generalized ones include:

:: '''Altai-eezi''', the "Master of Altai"--a sort of ''[[genius loci]]'', suitably adapted for an Altaian national consciousness.

:: '''Ul'gan'''--a spiritual ancestor of several Altaian clans. Originally a proper name, now generalized. Some sources describe Ul'gan as the creator of the universe in Burkhanist theology; this is probably a misunderstanding.

Historically, Burkhanism rejected the traditional gods of the underworld, notably '''[[Erlik]]''' ('''Yerlik'''), its chief. This rejection is closely related to Burkhanism's rejection of Altaian shamanism, and corresponding elevation of oral epic singers (''yarlikchi''). (By "shaman" is here meant ''manjaktu kam''s, i.e. the "costume-wearing" specialists who communicate with the underworld gods.) Both rejections are likely to have been inspired by oral epic lore, which regularly features shamans as villains.

==Practices==
*Burning juniper (''archyn'') for blessing, purification, or healing
*Home or hilltop altars (''kure'' or ''murgul''), with candles and milk-offerings
*Erecting of [[cairn]]s (''[[oboo]]'')
*Recitation / composition / patronage of oral epics
*Divination and weather-control
*Display of white and yellow ribbons or streamers (from trees or strings, or dangling from the back of one's headgear)
*Prayer while standing, with hands raised; or with prostrations
*Celebration of festivals:
**''Shuten'' or ''Murgul''—a semiannual (spring and fall) festival dedicated to Uch Kurbustan
**''Chok'' or ''Jajyk Choktor''—a fall festival dedicated to ''jajyks''
**''Ot Takyr''—dedicated to Ot-Ene

Some sources speak of a list of "Twenty Commandments" for Burkhanism. The evidence for this is sparse. Alcohol and tobacco were proscribed in the early years.

Chugul came to be venerated as the main recipient of the original message. This was much less true of Chet, although both were addressed with honorific titles.

==Notable Burkhanists==
[[Grigorii Choros-Gurkin]], a Soviet landscape artist and leader of the Karakorum Executive Committee.

==Burkhanism today==
Russian painter [[Nicholas Roerich]] and his wife [[Helena Roerich]] passed through Altai in 1926. Nicholas painted ''Oirat—Messenger of the White Burkhan'' based on his understanding of the movement.

(Note that the painting's title apparently gets the theology backward—it was rather White Burkhan who was the messenger for Oirat.) Followers of [[Agni Yoga]], an [[esoteric]] movement founded by the Roerichs, have encouraged a recent revival of interest in Burkhanism among non-Altaians. At the same time they have insisted on a link with [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and a veneration of Mount [[Belukha]], elements not found in traditional Burkhanism.

A number of Burkhanist revival organizations emerged during the 1990s, mostly as attempts to formulate or preserve an Altaian ethno-nationalist identity. To that end many of them have been persuaded to reconsider earlier Burkhanism's vexed relationship with shamanism and / or Buddhism. A list of movements follows, with the name of a founder or leading supporter in parenthesis. For more information see Agniezka Halemba's article (linked below).

[[File:Carlos Mirabelli 3.jpg|thumb|Mirabelli (left) with alleged '[[materialization (paranormal)|materialization]]' (middle).]]
'''Carmine Carlos Mirabelli''' (2 January, 1889 - April 30, 1951) was a [[Brazil]]ian physical medium and [[Spiritualist]] from South America.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2006"&gt;Anderson, Rodger. (2006). ''Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules: A Biographical Dictionary with Bibliographies''. McFarland &amp; Company. p. 121. {{ISBN|978-0786427703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Mirabelli was born in Botucatu, [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], of Italian parents. He studied [[Spiritism]] at an early age and was introduced to the writings of [[Allan Kardec]]. As a teenager he worked in a shoe shop and claimed to have experienced [[poltergeist]] activity where shoe boxes would literally fly off the shelves. He was placed in an [[lunatic asylum]] for observation and psychologists said there was something wrong with him, but he was not physically sick.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Buckland|Buckland, Raymond]]. (2005). ''The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channeling, and Spirit Communication''. Visible Ink Press. p. 259. {{ISBN|978-1578592135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirabelli later became a medium and it was alleged he could produce [[automatic handwriting]], materializations of objects and people ([[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]), [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]]s and [[Psychokinesis|movement of objects]].&lt;ref name="Mello 1960"&gt;[[Antônio da Silva Mello|Mello, Antônio da Silva]]. (1960). ''Mysteries and Realities of This World and the Next''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. pp. 382-385&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, Mirabelli was tested by the Academia de Estudos Psychicos Cesare Lombroso in São Paulo and a report published in 1926 wrote that in more than 300 sittings genuine [[Materialization (paranormal)|materializations]] had been observed. When the report was published in English, it was challenged by various [[Parapsychology|psychical researchers]]. In 1928, the German scientist [[Hans Driesch]] investigated Mirabelli and found that some objects had been moved in the [[séance]] room but that there was no evidence for his supposed abilities of materialization or [[Apport (paranormal)|apportation]]. Mirabelli later began giving public mediumship demonstrations which were described as theatrical displays. Throughout his life Mirabelli had been involved with 15 [[lawsuit]]s for the illegal practice of [[witchcraft]]. He was suspected of utilizing tricks.&lt;ref&gt;Aykroyd, Peter H; Narth, Angela; Aykroyd, Dan. (2009). ''A History of Ghosts: The True Story of Séances, Mediums, Ghosts, and Ghostbusters''. Rodale Books. pp. 92-95. {{ISBN|978-1605298757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was alleged that Mirabelli could move bottles of magnetized water on a table without contact with them. This was disputed by [[Antônio da Silva Mello]] who noted that such a trick could have been performed "by means of a thread led to the table or by several other means, principally by the help of a partner who in this particular case was suspected by several persons present to be the medium's wife."&lt;ref name="Mello 1960"/&gt;

==Society for Psychical Research Investigation==

In 1934, [[Theodore Besterman]] a research officer for the [[Society for Psychical Research]] visited Brazil to investigate Mirabelli. He discovered that some  of the witness reports from the Academia de Estudos Psychicos Cesare Lombroso were unreliable and it was not an independent organization but one that was associated with Mirabelli and his personal friends. Whilst investigating the séances, Besterman claimed to have detected trickery.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2006"/&gt;

==Levitation trick==

In 1990, Dr. [[Gordon Stein]] found a levitation [[photograph]] of Mirabelli in the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) collection at the [[Cambridge University Library]]. It was inscribed by Mirabelli to Besterman from his visit in 1934.&lt;ref name="Stein 1996"&gt;[[Gordon Stein|Stein, Gordon]]. (1996). ''Carlos Mirabelli''. In ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. [[Prometheus Books]]. pp. 400-404. {{ISBN|1-57392-021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The levitation in the photograph was discovered to be a trick as there were signs of chemical retouching under Mirabelli's feet. The retouching showed that Mirabelli was not levitating but was standing on a ladder which was erased from the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (2005). ''Camera Clues: A Handbook for Photographic Investigation''. [[University Press of Kentucky]]. p. 178. {{ISBN|978-0813191249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stein:

:The fact that the fraudulent photo has been inscribed by Mirabelli to Besterman means that Mirabelli, then at the very peak of his powers was at least in pan, a fraud. He knowingly passed off a fraudulent photo of himself as authentic. It should make us cautious about accepting hearsay statements of Mirabelli's followers about the many wonders he had performed. More importantly, it should make us very cautious about accepting at face value other photographs of Mirabelli's marvels.&lt;ref name="Stein 1996"/&gt;

'''Cheontae''' is the [[Korea]]n descendant of the [[China|Chinese]] Buddhist school [[Tiantai]].  Tiantai was introduced to Korea a couple of times during earlier periods, but was not firmly established until the time of [[Uicheon]] (1055-1101) who established Cheontae in [[Goryeo]] as an independent school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S. Jr.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|editor2-link=Donald S. Lopez, Jr.|title=Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism.|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=912–913|isbn=9780691157863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Uicheon's influence, it came to be a major force in the world of [[Goryeo]] [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhism]]. After he returned from Song China in 1086, Uicheon sought to ease conflict between the doctrinal Gyo ({{lang|ko|教}}) schools and [[Zen|Seon]] ({{lang|ko|禪}}) schools, believing that the Cheontae doctrine would be effective to this end.  Cheontae doctrine holds the [[Lotus Sutra]] as the peak of the Buddha's teachings, and postulates the following:

* All things are empty and without essential reality.
* All things have a provisional reality.
* All things are both absolutely unreal and provisionally real at once.

In accordance with the Cheontae doctrine, all experiences in the sensory world are in fact expressions of Buddhist law (Dharma), and therefore contain the key to enlightenment. This explains the extravagant altars and the colorful details found at Cheontae temples, differing from the austere aesthetic of the Seon (Zen) school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iguide.travel/Guinsa]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheontae as a school has been largely absorbed into the [[Jogye]] Seon tradition, but an independent Cheontae school has been revived and has an estimated 2 million adherents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbtour.net/ecb_web/ecb_tour/ew_package_v?id=00224] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050218153114/http://www.cbtour.net/ecb_web/ecb_tour/ew_package_v?id=00224 |date=February 18, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school's headquarters are at [[Guinsa]] in [[Chungcheongbuk-do]], near [[Danyang County|Danyang]]. The school also funds and operates the Buddhist university, [[Geumgang University]].

'''Chunaru''' ({{lang-bn|চুনারু}}) is a [[Bengali Hindu]] caste whose traditional occupation is the manufacture of slaked lime from the shell of snails.&lt;ref name="kundu"&gt;{{cite book |title=বাঙালি হিন্দু জাতি পরিচয় |trans-title=An Introduction of Bengali Hindu Castes |language=Bengali |last=Kundu |first=Santosh Kumar |year=2008 |publisher=Presidency Library |location=Kolkata |isbn=978-81-89466-13-8 |pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the advent of quick lime from limestone and the arrival of cement as mortar ingredient, the Chunaru struggled to make a living of their traditional vocation and gradually dwindled in numbers. According to Dr. Maniklal Sinha, there are only about two to three hundred Chunaru families in [[West Bengal]] today.

== History ==
The [[Brahma Vaivarta Purana]] and the [[Brihaddharma Purana]] have no mention of the Chunarus. According to Santosh Kumar Kundu, the Chunarus were probably counted within the Shankhakars. He also believes that the Chunaru are neither counted as a Scheduled Caste or as an Other Backward Class probably because their numbers are very small. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}


The shells are first burnt in earthen ovens and then watered to prepare the slaked lime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ঝিনুক থেকে চুন উত্পাদনই জীবিকা |language=Bengali |trans-title=Where preparing lime from shells is the occupation |author=Ishwardi.com Newsdesk |url=http://www.ishwardi.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=194:2010-01-11-14-26-56&amp;catid=81:2009-12-21-09-54-38 |newspaper=Ishwardi.com |date=January 11, 2010 |accessdate=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hume titlepage1779.jpg|thumb|Title page]]
[[File:Painting of David Hume.jpg|thumb|David Hume]]
'''''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] work by the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]]. Through dialogue, three philosophers named Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes debate the nature of [[God]]'s existence. Whether or not these names reference specific philosophers, ancient or otherwise, remains a topic of scholarly dispute. While all three agree that a god exists, they differ sharply in opinion on God's nature or attributes and how, or if, humankind can come to knowledge of a deity.

In the ''Dialogues'', Hume's characters debate a number of [[argument]]s for the [[existence of God]], and arguments whose proponents believe through which we may come to know the nature of God. Such topics debated include the [[argument from design]]—for which Hume uses a house—and whether there is more suffering or good in the world ([[argument from evil]]).

Hume started writing the ''Dialogues'' in 1750 but did not complete them until 1776, shortly before his death. They are based partly on [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Natura Deorum]]''. The ''Dialogues'' were [[List of works published posthumously|published posthumously]] in 1779, originally with neither the author's nor the publisher's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hume |first=David|year=1779 |title=  Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |publisher= |place=London |edition= Second |page=  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7dbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= 20 June 2016}} via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
*'''Pamphilus''' is a youth present during the dialogues. In a [[Letter (message)|letter]], he reconstructs the conversation of Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes in detail for his friend Hermippus. He serves as the [[narrator]] throughout the piece. At the end of the Dialogues he believes that Cleanthes offered the strongest arguments. However, this could be out of loyalty to his teacher, as this does not seem to reflect Hume's own views on the topic. When other pieces on religion by Hume are taken into consideration, it may be noted that they all end with (apparently) ironic statements reaffirming the truth of Christian religious views. While the irony may be less readily evident in the Dialogues, this would suggest a similar reading of this work's ending.&lt;ref&gt;See Bernd Gräfrath's "Vernunftige Gelassenheit" in G. Gabriel, C. Schildknecht, Literarische Formen der Philosophie. Metzler, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero used a similar technique in his Dialogues. 
*'''Cleanthes''' is an "experimental theist"&amp;mdash;"an exponent of orthodox empiricism"&lt;ref name="anth"&gt;Anthony C. Thiselton, "A Concise Encyclopedia of the Philosophy of Religion"&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;who bases his beliefs about God's existence and nature upon a version of the [[teleological argument]], which uses evidence of design in the universe to argue for God's existence and resemblance to the human mind.
* '''Philo''', according to the predominant view among scholars, is the character who presents views most similar to those of Hume.&lt;ref&gt;William Crouch, {{cite web |url=http://www.onphilosophy.co.uk/natural_religion.html |title="Which character is Hume in the "Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion"?" |accessdate=2006-12-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205192218/http://www.onphilosophy.co.uk/natural_religion.html |archivedate=December 5, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philo, along with Demea, attacks Cleanthes' views on anthropomorphism and teleology; while not going as far as to deny the existence of God, Philo asserts that human reason is wholly inadequate to make any assumptions about the divine, whether through ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' reasoning or observation of nature.
* '''Demea''' "defends the [[Cosmological argument]] and philosophical theism..."&lt;ref name="anth" /&gt; He believes that the existence of God should be proven through ''a priori'' reasoning and that our beliefs about the nature of God should be based upon revelation and [[fideism]]. Demea rejects Cleanthes' "[[natural religion]]" for being too [[anthropomorphic]].  Demea objects to the abandonment of the ''a priori'' arguments by Philo and Cleanthes (both of whom are empiricists) and perceives Philo to be "accepting an extreme form of [[skepticism]]."&lt;ref name="anth"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15033">{{Status of religious freedom}}

The right to '''freedom of religion in the United Kingdom''' is provided for in all [[Law of the United Kingdom#Three legal systems|three constituent legal systems]], by devolved, national, European, and international law and treaty. Four constituent nations compose the United Kingdom, resulting in an [[religion in the United Kingdom|inconsistent religious character]], and there is no state church for the whole kingdom. 
== Laws guaranteeing freedom of religion ==

=== European Convention on Human Rights ===

The ECHR guarantees in Article 9 that subjects will have:

{{quotation|The right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance[…]

The freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.}}

=== Human Rights Act ===
The right is given in the United Kingdom by s. 1 ss. (1)(a) of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] (HRA), as the "right and fundamental freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/section/1|title=Human Rights Act 1998 1998 c. 42 s. 1|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations General Assembly ===

In Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in resolution 2200A (XXI) on 16 December 1966, the UN resolved that:

{{Quotation|Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice or teaching.}}

The [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]], a sub-body of the General Assembly, also resolved in General comment 22 on 30 July 1993 that the right to freedom of religion applies to unconventional or extra-institutional religions, as well as atheist or anti-clerical beliefs:

{{Quotation|Article 18 [of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief. The terms belief and religion are to be broadly construed. Article 18 is not limited in its application to traditional religions or to religions and beliefs with institutional characteristics or practices analogous to those of traditional religions.}}

== Monarchy ==
The [[Act of Settlement 1701]] decrees that the monarch of Great Britain (later the United Kingdom) "shall join in communion with the Church of England". This act was specifically designed to prevent a Catholic monarch from ascending to the throne, but in effect discriminates against all religions other than [[Protestantism]]. Members of the Royal family in line of succession who married a Roman Catholic (though not adherents of other denominations or faiths) were excluded from the succession. Under the provisions of the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]], marrying a Roman Catholic no longer disqualifies a person from succeeding to the Crown; however, the provision of the Act of Settlement requiring the monarch to be a Protestant continues unrepealed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22300293 BBC News UK - 25 April 2013 - ''Law ending exclusively male royal succession now law'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Churches with special status==

=== Church of England ===
In England, the state church is the [[Church of England]], and the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]] of the church is the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Monarch]].  As already mentioned, the monarch is required to "join in communion with the Church of England".  As part of the [[coronation]] ceremony, the monarch swears an [[Coronation Oath|oath]] to "maintain and preserve inviolably the settlement of the Church of England, and the doctrine, worship, discipline, and government thereof, as by law established in England" before being crowned by the senior cleric of the Church, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].  All clergy of the Church swear an oath of allegiance to the monarch before taking office.

Parliament has authority to govern the Church of England, but, since [[Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919|1919]] has generally delegated this authority to that Church's [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] (earlier called the Church Assembly).  Parliament retains the ability to veto measures of the General Synod or Church Assembly; this rarely invoked power was used in 1927 and 1928 to prevent adoption of a [[Book of Common Prayer#Further attempts at revision|revised prayer book]].  Measures also require [[royal assent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandChurch/QueenandtheChurchofEngland.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202214246/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandChurch/QueenandtheChurchofEngland.aspx |archivedate=December 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Appointment of Church of England bishops|appointment of bishops and archbishops of the Church]] falls within the [[royal prerogative]]. In current practice, the Prime Minister makes the choice from two candidates submitted by a commission of prominent Church members, then passes his choice on to the monarch.  The Prime Minister plays this role even though he himself is not required to be a member of the Church of England or even a Christian—for example [[Clement Attlee]] was an [[agnostic]] who described himself as "incapable of religious feeling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Clement Attlee|first=Jerry Hardman|last=Brookshire|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=New York|year=1995|isbn=0-7190-3244-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tn27AAAAIAAJ|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is an established church, the Church of England receives no state funding.  Instead, the Church relies on donations, land and investments.

===Church of Scotland===
Since the [[Church of Scotland Act 1921]], the Church of Scotland has been independent from the state.  The monarch does, however, take an oath to preserve the Church of Scotland at the meeting of the Privy Council immediately following his or her accession.&lt;ref name="royal.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandChurch/QueenandtheChurchofScotland.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202215833/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandChurch/QueenandtheChurchofScotland.aspx |archivedate=December 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The monarch also has the right to attend the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, but usually sends a High Commissioner in his or her place.&lt;ref name="royal.gov.uk"/&gt;

===Church in Wales===
Since 1920, the [[Church in Wales]] has been independent of the state.  The church is, however, legally required to perform opposite-sex marriages where at least one of those being married has resided in the parish for six months (a similar requirement applies to the Church of England).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/life/marriage/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption agencies ==

The [[Equality Act 2006]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6311503.stm ''No exemption for church adoption''], [[BBC News]], 29 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; is applied equally to religious-based and secular adoption agencies. The Catholic adoption agencies unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a compromise that would include an exemption for religious-based agencies, which would have allowed them to continue to facilitate adoption for opposite-sex parents only.

== Education ==

Several university student associations have implemented rules that require affiliated groups to allow "anybody, regardless of faith, ethnicity or sexuality, to sit on their ruling committees and to address their meetings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2469153,00.html ''Bishops back student fight for religious freedom on campus''], [[TimesOnline]], 24 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  However some Christian Unions say they should be allowed to require that their ruling committees share their beliefs.

== Service provision ==

In May 2008, Lillian Ladele, a [[Registrar General|registrar]] from [[Islington]], [[London]], took her employer, [[Islington London Borough Council]], to the London Central [[Employment Tribunal]], with the financial backing of the [[Christian Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1020809/Christian-registrar-threatened-sack-refusing-conduct-gay-marriages.html | work=Daily Mail | first=Paul | last=Sims | title=Christian registrar 'threatened with sack' after refusing to conduct gay marriages | date=21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ladele had refused to conduct [[Civil partnerships in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]] on religious grounds, and following complaints from other staff she was disciplined under the Council's ''Fairness for All'' policy. Ladele claimed she had been subject to direct and indirect discrimination, and harassment in the workplace, on grounds of her religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7413298.stm | work=BBC News | title=Registrars 'in fear' over beliefs | date=21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In July 2008, the tribunal found in Ladele's favour, however this ruling was overturned by the [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]] in December, 2008.&lt;ref name="guardian_ladele"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/20/gayrights-law Landmark rulings strengthen gay rights in workplace]. [[The Guardian]], December 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[2009] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/1357.html EWCA Civ 1357]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 a judge ruling on a bed and breakfast refusing to accommodate unmarried couples found in favour of a gay couple under the [[Equality Act 2010]] but allowed an appeal, commenting that the ruling: 'does affect the human rights of the defendants to manifest their religion'.[http://www.christian.org.uk/news/judge-rules-against-christians-in-bb-case-but-allows-appeal]

== History ==

Due to the United Kingdom having been formed by the [[political union|union]] of previously independent states from 1707,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/ Acts of Union 1707] parliament.uk, accessed 31 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/uniting.htm Uniting the kingdom?] nationalarchives.gov.uk, accessed 31 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/visitingHolyrood/union_exhibition.pdf Making the Act of Union 1707] scottish.parliament.uk, accessed 31 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; most of the largest religious groups do not have UK-wide organisational structures.

=== Blasphemy law ===

{{main|Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom}}

The common law offence of [[blasphemy]] was repealed in 2008. The last person to be imprisoned for blasphemy in the UK was [[John William Gott]] in 1922, for comparing [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] to a [[clown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3753408.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q &amp; A: Blasphemy law | date=18 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next blasphemy case was in 1977, when [[Mary Whitehouse]] brought a private prosecution ([[Whitehouse v. Lemon]]) against the editor of ''[[Gay News]]'' for blasphemous libel after he published a poem by [[James Kirkup]] called "The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name". Denis Lemon was given a nine-month suspended sentence and a £500 fine for publishing the "most scurrilous profanity" which portrayed the sexual love of a Roman centurion for the body of Christ on the cross.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/print/0%2C3858%2C5041480-103602%2C00.html | work=The Guardian | first=Alan | last=Travis | title=Medieval blasphemy laws set for repeal | date=18 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence was upheld on appeal.

In this appeal case, [[Leslie Scarman, Baron Scarman|Lord Scarman]] held that the modern law of blasphemy was correctly formulated in Article 214 of ''Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law'', 9th edition (1950). This states as follows:

{{Quotation|Every publication is said to be blasphemous which contains any contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible, or the formularies of the [[Church of England]] as by law established. It is not blasphemous to speak or publish opinions hostile to the Christian religion, or to deny the existence of God, if the publication is couched in decent and temperate language. The test to be applied is as to the manner in which the doctrines are advocated and not to the substance of the doctrines themselves.}}

In 1996 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (case #19/1995/525/611) upheld a ban on ''Visions of Ecstasy'', an erotic video about a 16th-century nun, based on the video infringing on the blasphemy law.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; The Court estimated that a limited ban on vulgar or obscene publications that would be offensive to believers, while keeping legal the criticism of religion, was compatible with the principles of a democratic society.

On May 8, 2008 the offence of blasphemy was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humaniststudies.org/enews/?id%3D348%26article%3D0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607204857/http://humaniststudies.org/enews/?id=348&amp;article=0 |archivedate=2008-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some acts that were once viewed as blasphemous may now be prosecutable under other legislation, such as the [[Public Order Act 1986]] as amended by the [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Strange Death of Blasphemy", by Russell Sandberg and Norman Doe, in ''The Modern Law Review'' '''71''', #6 (November 2008), pp. 971-986, {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2230.2008.00723.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[God in Christianity]] is represented by the [[Trinity]] of three [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostases or "persons"]] described as [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]] and [[Holy Spirit]]. 
While "Father" and "Son" implicitly invoke [[male|masculine sex]], the [[gender of the Holy Spirit]] from earliest times was also represented as including feminine aspects (partly due to grammatical gender, especially in the Syriac church). Furthermore, the (feminine) concept of [[Holy Wisdom]] was identified with [[Christ the Logos]] and thus with [[God the Son]] from earliest times. 
Even the ostensibly masculine terms "Father" and "Son" were explicitly stated to be taken as metaphorical, and not as representing divine [[ousia|essence]], 
by [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (4th century).&lt;ref name=ONeill8&gt;Dennis O'Neill, ''Passionate Holiness: Marginalized Christian Devotions for Distinctive Peoples'' (2010), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=qjl1H9GcetMC&amp;pg=PA8 p. 8].&lt;/ref&gt; 
The same position is still held in the 1992 [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;"In no way is God in man's image. He is neither man nor woman. God is pure spirit in which there is no place for the difference between the sexes. But the respective 'perfections' of man and woman reflect something of the infinite perfection of God: those of a mother and those of a father and husband." [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p6.htm CCC 370].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=bordwell&gt;David Bordwell, 2002, ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'',Continuum International Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-86012-324-8}} page 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCCs239"&gt;"Deum humanam sexuum transcendere distinctionem. Ille nec vir est nec femina, Ille est Deus." From "Pater per Filium revelatus", ''Catechismus Catholicae Ecclesiae''. (Citta del Vaticano: Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1993): 1-2-1-1-2 ¶ 239. ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P17.HTM Official English translation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303003725/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P17.HTM |date=March 3, 2013 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammatical gender in the Bible==
The first words of the [[Old Testament]] are ''B'reshit bara Elohim''—"In the beginning God created."&lt;ref&gt;[[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]], (Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 1990), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The verb ''bara'' (created) [[Verb conjugation#Verbal agreement|agrees]] with a [[grammatical gender|masculine]] [[grammatical number|singular]] subject.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} ''[[Elohim]]'' is used to refer to both genders and is plural; it has been used to refer to both Goddess (in 1 Kings 11:33), and God (1 Kings 11:31; https://sites.google.com/site/yahwehelohiym/yahweh/yahweh-the-elohim-of-israel). The masculine gender in Hebrew can be used for objects with no inherent gender, as well as objects with masculine natural gender, and so it is widely used, attributing the masculine gender to most things.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} However, the noun used for the Spirit of God in Genesis—"Ruach"—is distinctly feminine, as is the verb used to describe Her activity during creation—"rachaph"—translated as "fluttereth". This verb is used only one other place in the Bible (Deuteronomy 32:11) where it describes the action of a mother eagle towards her nest. The consistent use of feminine nouns and verbs to refer to the Spirit of God in the Torah, as well as the rest of the Jewish Scriptures, indicates that at least this aspect of Elohim was consistently perceived as Feminine.&lt;ref&gt;(Sexism is a Sin, by J.R. Hyland).&lt;/ref&gt;
Genesis 1:26-27 says that the ''[[elohim]]'' were male and female,&lt;ref name=coogan&gt;{{cite book|last=Coogan|first=Michael|title=God and Sex. What the Bible Really Says|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_gPKQEACAAJ&amp;dq=god+and+sex |accessdate=May 5, 2011|edition=1st|date=October 2010 |publisher=Twelve. Hachette Book Group|location=New York, Boston|isbn=978-0-446-54525-9|page=175|chapter=6. Fire in Divine Loins: God's Wives in Myth and Metaphor|quote=humans are modeled on ''elohim'', specifically in their sexual differences.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and humans were made in their image.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan (2010:176)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the most common phrases in the [[Tanakh]] are ''vayomer Elohim'' and ''vayomer YHWH''—"and God said". Again, the verb ''vayomer'' (he said) is masculine; it is never ''vatomer'', the feminine of the same verb form. The personal name of God, ''YHWH'', is presented in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus 3]] as if the ''Y'' (Hebrew ''yod'') is the masculine subjective prefix to the verb ''to be''.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In [[Psalms]] 89:26 God is referred to as Father.
"He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation."&lt;ref&gt;ASV 1901, Public Domain&lt;/ref&gt;

Some literary approaches to the [[Old Testament]] have argued that parallels between Biblical stories and earlier [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] and [[Canaan]]ite creation myths show a matriarchal substratum that has been overlaid by a patriarchal approach.&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, ''The Origins and History of Consciousness'' pages 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt; "In the Bible, the earth is the feminine complement of God: the two combined to form man, who articulates their relationship, for example, in sacrifice."&lt;ref&gt;Francis Landy, The Song of Songs chapter of ''The Literary Guide to the Bible'', page 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Testament]] also refers to the Holy Spirit in masculine terminology,{{vague|date=December 2010}} most clearly in the [[Gospel of John]] 14-16.

==Denominational views==

===Roman Catholic Church===
The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] (CCC) #239 states, in reference to the Father: "God transcends the human distinction between the sexes. He is neither man nor woman: he is God."&lt;ref name=bordwell/&gt;&lt;ref name="CCCs239"/&gt; The CCC discusses the traditional imagery and language of God as Father.&lt;ref name=CCCs239 /&gt; It notes, however, that God is not limited to this role alone—maternal [[Imagery (literature)|imagery]] are also used in the Bible.&lt;ref name=CCCs239 /&gt; It also notes that human fatherhood only imperfectly reflects God's archetypal fatherhood.&lt;ref name=CCCs239 /&gt;
God is referred to as masculine in Catholic teaching and practice.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20010507_liturgiam-authenticam_en.html Liturgiam Authenticam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118125820/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20010507_liturgiam-authenticam_en.html |date=January 18, 2012 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

Though [[Catholic Church|Church]] teaching, in line with its [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors]], holds that God has no literal sex because he has no body (a prerequisite of sex),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Summa Theologica|year=1274|location=Part 1, Question 3, Article 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=of Hippo|first=Augustine|title=Confessions|date=c. 397|location=Book 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; classical and scriptural understanding states that God should be referred to (in most contexts) as masculine by analogy. It justifies this by pointing to God's relationship with the world as begetter of the world and revelation (i.e. analogous to an active instead of feminine receptive role in sexual intercourse).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lang |first1=David |title=Why Matter Matters: Philosophical and Scriptural Reflections on the Sacraments |year=2002 |publisher=Our Sunday Visitor |location=Chapter Five: Why Male Priests? |isbn=978-1931709347 |author2=Peter Kreeft |authorlink=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Council of Churches===
The Inclusive Language Lectionary published by the American [[National Council of Churches]], to which many Protestant churches belong, states in its introduction "The God worshiped by the biblical authors and worshiped in the Church today cannot be regarded as having gender, race, or color."
&lt;ref name=NCC&gt;{{cite book|title=An inclusive-language lectionary: Readings for Year B|edition=Revised|publisher=National Council of Churches|year=1987|pages=12|isbn=978-0-664-24059-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LDS Church===

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) differs from most churches in that they believe that the [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Father, the Son and the Spirit]] are separate and male as well as masculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution= Lesson 1: The Godhead |url= http://www.lds.org/manual/aaronic-priesthood-manual-3/lesson-1-the-godhead?lang=eng |title= Aaronic Priesthood Manual 3 |publisher= LDS Church |year= 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1= Donald Q. |last1= Cannon |authorlink= Donald Q.

See also: [[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusive language==
A common source of confusion on this issue is the continued use of masculine language to describe God by many Christian groups. Such language does not necessarily imply a belief in the masculinity of God, although it is sometimes taken as such. For example the Catholic Church continues to describe God using masculine terms, in spite of the clear doctrinal statement that God "transcends gender".&lt;ref name=bordwell/&gt;&lt;ref name="CCCs239"/&gt; For most groups this language is traditional, though it also reflects a belief that some gender-neutral language (such as referring to God as "it") does not adequately reflect the personhood of God. Devices such as invented gender-neutral terms and alternating masculine/feminine terms are seen as clumsy.

Many churches have however adopted inclusive language in the description of God. In recent history, many [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] and [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] denominations have adopted or encouraged the use of inclusive language (such as both feminine and masculine language, or non-gendered language) when referring to God; these include the [[United Church of Christ]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of America]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elca.org/secretary/guidelines/ELCAPublishingStandards.pdf ELCA Publishing Standards] (2003), Section on "Terms for God: Inclusive language"&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Metropolitan Community Church]].

===United Church of Christ===
[[The New Century Hymnal]], the hymnal of the United Church of Christ (UCC), uses inclusive language; one of its concerns while being authored was reducing the solely-masculine use of language for God, and/or balancing masculine images with feminine and non-gendered images, while retaining masculine imagery for Jesus regarding his earthly life.

At least two UCC conferences (Massachusetts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inclusive Language Guidelines |url=http://www.macucc.org/leadership/inclusive_language.htm |accessdate=2008-07-09 |publisher=Massachusetts Conference, United Church of Christ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511174329/http://www.macucc.org/leadership/inclusive_language.htm |archivedate=2008-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ohio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inclusive Language Guidelines |url=http://www.ocucc.org/Resources/InclusiveGuide.htm |accessdate=2008-07-09 |publisher=Ohio Conference - United Church of Chris |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513220020/http://ocucc.org/Resources/InclusiveGuide.htm |archivedate=2008-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) have adopted guidelines for using inclusive language, and the majority of clergy and laity in the UCC report using inclusive language when referring to God during worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.org/assets/pdfs/witgf/ss2005.pdf Worshipping into God's Future: Summary and Strategies 2005], United Church of Christ.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ministry ==
=== Bethel Family Worship Center ===
In June 1996, the Lord spoke to [then] Evangelist George Bloomer that he would soon begin pastoring a church, so he pitched a tent and began a 30-day old-fashioned Holy Ghost Crusade. This first tent meeting drew national attention as some city officials demanded the Crusade to cease and the tent to come down; but God said stay and the man of God would not be moved. The battle was fought, the ministry prevailed and Bethel Family Worship Center began after the 30-day tent revival's completion. 
Bethel Family Worship Center was birthed out of warfare and today continues to serve the Lord as a place for people to come hear the uncompromised Word of God and be set free! Bethel's desire is to reach the heart and save the soul.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://bethelfamily.org/history Bethel Family Worship Center History]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== C.L.U.R.T. – Come Let Us Reason Together ===
C.L.U.R.T. International Assemblies is an organization that provides covering for many independent churches. The founder, Bishop George G. Bloomer, is the presiding Bishop and Overseer. The purpose of CLURT is to prepare God-called men and women for spiritual service in C.L.U.R.T.

The '''Hamaj Regency''' ({{lang-ar|وصاية ٱلهمج}} {{transl|ar|wiṣāyat ul-Hamaj}}) was a political order in the region of modern-day central [[Sudan]] from 1762 to 1821. During this period the ruling family of the [[Sennar (sultanate)|Funj Sultanate of Sennar]] continued to reign, while actual power was exercised by the regents.

==Origins==
The [[Shankalla]] were people of the upper Blue Nile, between [[Sennar]] and [[Ethiopia]].  They predate the arrival of the Arabs in that part of Sudan, and are considered by some to be part of the Shilluk group of peoples. Their language is part of the [[Koman languages|Koman]] branch of the Sudan linguistic family.&lt;ref&gt;James Stuart Olson, The Peoples of Africa: An Ethnohistorical Dictionary, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996 p.219&lt;/ref&gt; They were often the targets of [[Funj]] slave raids, and the term 'hamaj' was a derogatory term (meaning 'riffraff') used by the Funj to describe them.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour Khalid, War &amp; Peace in the Sudan, Routledge 2012 p.9&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hamaj were incorporated into the Funj [[Sultanate of Sennar]] in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Loimeier, Muslim Societies in Africa: A Historical Anthropology, Indiana University Press, 2013 p.152&lt;/ref&gt; Funj society was strictly divided by skin colour and other physical characteristics.  The Funj classified themselves as 'blue' ({{lang-ar|ازرق}} ''{{transl|ar|azraq}}'') and they described the Hamaj as 'red' ({{lang-ar|احمر}} ''{{transl|ar|aḥmar}}'').&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Thomas &amp; Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, State and Instability in the South, Springer, 1989 p.62&lt;/ref&gt; According to 'The Funj Chronicle', a slave called Hamaj settled in Sennar along with his extended family, where the prospered and 'increased greatly until they had the power and the prestige in the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Malcolm Holt, The Sudan of the Three Niles: The Funj Chronicle, 910-1288/1504-1871, Brill, 1999 p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seizure of Power==
The Hamaj came to power during the reign of Sultan [[Badi IV]].  He made himself unpopular among the ruling elite by distributing lands of old established families to his new non-Funj followers — [[Nuba]] and others. This continued a policy advanced by some of his predecessors, of relying less on the traditional Funj military aristocracy and more on slave armies. Badi placed his military forces under the command of the Hamaj general [[Muhammad Abu Likaylik]], whom he had appointed as shaykh (possibly, governor) of [[Kordofan]] in 1747.  When news of Badi's increasingly arbitrary rule reached the Funj armies in Kordofan, they agreed to depose him under the leadership of Abu Likaylik. They crossed the White Nile back into core Funj territory at Alays, where they were joined by Badi's son [[Nasir of Sennar|Nasir]].  They advanced on Sennar and surrounded it, but agreed to allow Badi to leave under an amnesty.  Abu Likaylik then installed Nasir as sultan, and the regency began.&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Holt and M.W. Daly, A History of the Sudan, Routledge 2014.29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hamaj rule==
The sixty years of the Hamaj regency were characterised by constant internal strife, both between the Hamaj and the Funj sultans, and between different members of Abu Likaylik's family.

Eight years after he had installed Nasir as sultan, Abu Likaylik removed him and banished him.  When he learned that Nasir was conspiring to regain his throne, he had him executed. When Abu Likaylik died in 1776 or 77 he was replaced as regent by his brother, Badi wad Rajab. Once again the ruling Funj sultan, now Ismail, conspired unsuccessfully to remove the regent.  Ismail was banished to [[Suakin]] and his son Adlan II made sultan in his place.&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Holt and M.W. Daly, A History of the Sudan, Routledge 2014 p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Then some of the sons of Abu Likaylik rebelled against Badi wad Rajab, in alliance with Adlan II, and killed him. One of the sons, Rajab, then assumed the regency himself. During his regency the Hamaj faced their greatest crisis when the Funj nearly succeeded in overthrowing them. While Rajab was on campaign in Kordofan in 1784-5, the sultan Adlan II carried out a coup against Rajab's brother who was ruling as his deputy in Sennar. Returning from the west, Rajab was killed in the battle of Taras with Funj forces in November 1785, and the Hamaj forces retired in disarray. Adlan's restoration was short-lived however.  Ih 1788-9 the Hamaj defeated him again, restored their regency, and he died soon after. Rajab's campaign in 1785 marked the end of attempts by the Hamaj to control Kordofan, which was soon after (1787) conquered by the [[Sultanate of Darfur|Keira Sultanate]] of Darfur, which thereafter exercised effective control over all of the territory west of the [[White Nile]]. the beginning of the loss of territory to the Funj state which culminated, in 1821, with the sultans and regents controlling little outside the city of Sennar itself.&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Holt and M.W. Daly, A History of the Sudan, Routledge 2014 p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Internecine warfare continued however as the new regent Nasir found his position challenged by two of his brothers, Idris and Adlan.  After several months of fighting he was killed in 1798, in an act of revenge, by the son of regent Badi wad Rajab, to avenge his father. Both Idris and Adlan became co-regents.  Idris was distinguished by his reputation for justice and kindness,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Leslie Hill, A Biographical Dictionary of the Sudan, Psychology Press, 1967 p.179&lt;/ref&gt; and after his death Adlan ruled on his own.  His nephew Muhammad, then apparently also as co-regent, conspired against him, overthrew him and held power until 1808, when he was killed by Muhammad, son of the regent Adlan, in revenge for his father's murder. Muhammad wad Adlan managed to retain power until 1821, on the eve of the Egyptian invasion, when he was overthrown by his cousin Hasan wad Rajab.&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Holt and M.W. Daly, A History of the Sudan, Routledge 2014 p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
{{further|Egyptian invasion of Sudan 1820-24#Submission of Sennar}}
As the Egyptian army advanced south through Sudan in 1821, taking the submission of various tribes and towns as it went, the Hamaj regent Muhammad wad Adlan had sent a defiant message to its commander Ismail Pasha but early in April he was overthrown and killed by his cousin Hasan wad Rajab.  By the time Hasan had suppressed all opposition, it was too late to mount any kind of opposition to the Egyptians.  Hasan fled to the Ethiopian border, leaving the murdered regent's brother Ali wad Adlan to lead negotiations for capitulation.  Probably on 12 June, the last Funj sultan Badi VI offered his submission to Ismail in person, and the following day the Egyptian army entered Sennar unopposed. The descriptions of the town they found are a sad testament to the ruin to which the endless wars and strife of the Hamaj had reduced Sennar - the royal palace was derelict, and the mosque covered in graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Holt and M.W. Daly, A History of the Sudan, Routledge 2014 p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after taking Sennar Ismail Pasha suspected Ali wad Adlan of disloyalty, and had him hanged.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Leslie Hill, A Biographical Dictionary of the Sudan, Psychology Press, 1967 p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Ismail also hunted down Hasan wad Rajab and the killers of the regent Muhammad wad Adlan.  Hasan was imprisoned but treated with leniency - many of his confederates however were executed by impalement.&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Holt and M.W. Daly, A History of the Sudan, Routledge 2014 p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Ismail released Hasan wad Rajab from prison and Hasan accompanied him on an expedition to Fazughli, near the Ethiopian border, raiding for slaves with force of Hamaj cavalry alongside the Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Leslie Hill, A Biographical Dictionary of the Sudan, Psychology Press, 1967 p.158&lt;/ref&gt; In 1822, Ismail Pasha was killed by the [[Ja'alin tribe|Jaaliyyin]] at [[Shendi]].  Rebellions broke out all over central Sudan, but were steadily suppressed by the Egyptian garrisons along the Nile.  Hasan wad Rajab led one rebellion but was killed fighting them at the battle of Abu Shawka, south of Sennar.&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Holt and M.W. Daly, A History of the Sudan, Routledge 2014 p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

Idris Muhammad Adlan Abu Likaylik was a Hamaj chieftain who was lord of the Funj mountains near the Ethiopian border.  He had never submitted to Egyptian rule until 1826, when Ali Khurshid Bey, Egyptian governor of Sennar, brought about his reconciliation with the new regime.  He was then appointed shaykh of the Funj mountains, where he remained in office until 1851 when the Governor-General Abdul Latif Pasha removed him and replaced him with his nephew Adlan.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Leslie Hill, A Biographical Dictionary of the Sudan, Psychology Press, 1967 p.178&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, as the Egyptians steadily modernised local government, Hamaj clan members played little influence in Sudanese public life.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Leslie Hill, A Biographical Dictionary of the Sudan, Psychology Press, 1967 p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian [[theology]], the '''Harrowing of Hell''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Descensus Christi ad Inferos'', "the descent of Christ into hell") is the triumphant descent of [[Christ]] into Hell (or [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]) between the time of his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and his [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] when he brought salvation to all of the righteous who had died since the beginning of the world.&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;Warren, Kate Mary. "Harrowing of Hell." ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910.3 Mar. 2013 Notice that the Latin word is inferos NOT infernos. Inferos meaning below, infernos meaning flames of fire.&lt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07143d.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, the soul of Jesus descended into the realm of the dead.

The Harrowing of Hell is referred to in the [[Apostles' Creed]] and the [[Athanasian Creed|Athanasian Creed (''Quicumque vult'')]] which state that [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] "descended into [[Christian views on hell|Hell]]".

According to ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', the story first appears clearly in the [[Gospel of Nicodemus]] in the section called the [[Acts of Pilate]], which also appears separately at earlier dates within the [[Acts of Peter and Paul]].&lt;ref name="Wilhelm501"&gt;''New Testament Apocrypha, Vol. 1'' by Wilhelm Schneemelcher and R. Mcl. Wilson (Dec 1, 1990) {{ISBN|066422721X}} pages 501-502&lt;/ref&gt; The descent into hell had been related in [[Old English]] poems connected with the names of [[Cædmon]] and [[Cynewulf]]. It is subsequently repeated in [[Ælfric of Eynsham]]'s homilies c. 1000 AD, which is the first known inclusion of the word "harrowing". [[Middle English literature|Middle English dramatic literature]] contains the fullest and most dramatic development of the subject.&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;

As an image in [[Christian art]], the harrowing is also known as the '''''Anastasis''''' (a Greek word for "resurrection"), considered a creation of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine culture]] and first appearing in the [[Latin West|West]] in the early 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Ross, entry on "Anastasis", ''Medieval Art: A Topical Dictionary'' (Greenwood, 1996), pp. 10–11 [https://books.google.com/books?id=b-5YPoia7qwC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22ANASTASIS.+Anastasis%22+intitle:Medieval+intitle:art&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9Vw8TZ65DYHogQe836jwCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ANASTASIS.%20Anastasis%22%20intitle%3AMedieval%20intitle%3Aart&amp;f=false online].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The [[Greek language|Greek]] wording in the ''Apostles' Creed'' is {{lang|grc|κατελθόντα εἰς τὰ κατώτατα}}, ("katelthonta eis ta katôtata"), and in [[Latin]] ''descendit ad inferos''. The Greek {{lang|grc|τὰ κατώτατα}} (''ta katôtata'',"the lowest") and the Latin ''inferos'' ("those below") may also be translated as "[[underworld]]", "netherworld", or "abode of the dead."

The realm into which Jesus descended is called Hell, in long-established English usage, but [[Sheol]] or [[Limbo]] by some Christian theologians to distinguish it from the hell of the damned.&lt;ref name=Most&gt;Most, William G. "Christ's Descent into Hell and His Resurrection".&lt;http://www.ewtn.com/faith/teachings/resua1.htm&gt; Accessed 7 Mar 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "harrow" comes from the [[Old English]] ''hergian'' meaning to harry or despoil and is seen in the [[homily|homilies]] of [[Ælfric of Eynsham|Aelfric]], c. 1000.&lt;ref&gt;''Harrow'' is a by-form of ''harry'', a military term meaning to "make predatory raids or incursions"[[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Harrowing of Hell'' refers not merely to the idea that Christ descended into Hell, as in the Creed, but to the rich tradition that developed later, asserting that he triumphed over ''inferos'', releasing Hell's captives, particularly [[Adam and Eve]], and the righteous men and women of the [[Old Testament]] period.

===Scripture===
[[Image:MantegnaDescentLimbo.jpg|thumb|right|''Christ's Descent into [[Limbo]]'' by [[Andrea Mantegna]] and studio, c. 1470.]]

In [[Classical mythology]] Hades is the underworld inhabited by departed souls and the god [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] is its ruler. The New Testament uses the term "Hades" to refer to the abode or state of the dead. In some places it seems to represent a neutral place where the dead awaited the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. Several passages from the [[New Testament]] have been taken by some{{who|date=March 2017}} to imply that Christ descended into this realm of the dead to bring the righteous ones to Heaven. Other New Testament passages imply it is a place of torment for the unrighteous, leading to speculation that it may be divided into two very different sections.

====Verses containing the word "Hades"====
[[File:Bodleian Library MS. Arm. d.13. Armenian Gospels-0020-0.jpg|thumbnail|right|The descent into Hell, from a 1609 Armenian Gospel miniature, via the [[Bodleian Library]]]]
In the [[New King James]] version of the New Testament, there are 10 references to Hades:

* {{Bibleref2|Matthew|11:23}}: "And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to ''Hades''; for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day."
*{{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}}: "And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of ''Hades'' shall not prevail against it."
*{{Bibleref2|Luke|10:15}}: "And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to ''Hades''."
*{{Bibleref2|Luke|16:23}}: "And being in torments in ''Hades'', he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.'' (See article [[Abraham's bosom]])
*{{bibleref2|Acts|2:27}}: "For You will not leave my soul in ''Hades'', nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.''
*{{bibleref2|Acts|2:31}}: "...he, foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not left in ''Hades'', nor did His flesh see corruption."
*{{Bibleref2|1cor|15:55||1 Corinthians 15:55}}: “O Death, where is your sting? O ''Hades'', where is your victory?”
*{{Bibleref2|Revelation|1:18}}: "I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of ''Hades'' and of Death."
*{{Bibleref2|Revelation|6:8}}: "So I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and ''Hades'' followed with him. And power was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth."
*{{Bibleref2|Revelation|20:13}}: "The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works."
*{{Bibleref2|Revelation|20:14}}: "Then Death and ''Hades'' were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."

====Verses without "Hades" but doctrinal support====
Although these verses do not contain the word "Hades", theologians have concluded that comparable terms are used as synonyms:
* {{bibleref2|1Peter|3:19–20||1 Peter 3:19–20}}: (Jesus) "went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits—to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water...."
:In the original Greek: "{{lang|grc|ἐν ᾧ καὶ τοῖς ἐν φυλακῇ πνεύμασιν πορευθεὶς ἐκήρυξεν, ἀπειθήσασίν ποτε ὅτε ἀπεξεδέχετο ἡ τοῦ θεοῦ μακροθυμία ἐν ἡμέραις Νῶε…}}."
* {{bibleref2|Ephesians|4:7–10||Ephesians 4:7-10 NIV}}: "But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. This is why it&lt;sup&gt;[or God]&lt;/sup&gt; says, 'When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people.'{{Bibleref2c|Psalm|68:18}} (What does 'he ascended' mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions?&lt;sup&gt;[or ''the depths of the earth'']&lt;/sup&gt; He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe."
:In the original Greek: {{lang|grc|διὸ λέγει, ἀναβὰς εἰς ὕψος ᾐχμαλώτευσεν αἰχμαλωσίαν, ἔδωκεν δόματα τοῖς ἀνθρώποις. τὸ δὲ ἀνέβη τί ἐστιν εἰ μὴ ὅτι καὶ κατέβη εἰς τὰ κατώτερα [μέρη] τῆς γῆς; ὁ καταβὰς αὐτός ἐστιν καὶ ὁ ἀναβὰς ὑπεράνω πάντων τῶν οὐρανῶν, ἵνα πληρώσῃ τὰ πάντα.}}

: Verse 8 above is a truncated paraphrase adapting {{bibleref2|Psalm|68:18}}, with a changed point of view: "When you ascended on high, you led captives in your train; you received gifts from men, even from the rebellious—that you, O {{LORD}} God, might dwell there."(NIV) The parenthetical verses 9–10 of Ephesians are widely read as an [[exegesis|exegetical gloss]] on the text. The word for "lower parts" (the comparative form: {{lang|grc|τὰ κατώτερα}}) is similar to the word used for "Hell" in the Greek version of the Apostles Creed (the superlative form: {{lang|grc|τὰ κατώτατα}}, English: "lowest [places]").

:[[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]] writes that the entire passage {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|4:1-16}} is a prayerful exhortation to the readers that they measure up to their high calling in Christ. He takes "measuring up" to mean in terms of the unity and maturity of the one body which they already are (vv. 4,12,16). He says that in this long paragraph, the goal of redemption is the building up of the one body of Christ. {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|4:4-6||Verses 4 through 6}} set forth their sevenfold unity: "one body, one Spirit, ...one hope..., one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, the one over all and through all, and in all." Without mentioning "harrowing", he writes that "The very Christ who ''ascended'' is then described as the one who ''descended'' and who gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors, and teachers to the church.&lt;ref&gt;Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology.'' Nashville: Broadman, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.195}}
*{{Bibleref2|Philippians|2:9-10}}: "God exalted Him and gave to Him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bend, of those in heaven, and on the earth, and ''under the earth''" (Emphasis added).
:This can also refer to the power of Jesus over Satan. The passage is poetic, and so need not mean that Sheol is under the earth.&lt;ref name=Most/&gt;
* {{bibleref2|Romans|10:6-8}}: "But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:) Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;" refers to descending into the deep (the abyss) and this is contrasted with ascending into heaven.
:These verses speak of the work of Christ as Himself having done all that is necessary, descending to the deep and ascending into heaven, being complete and sufficient for all who believe in Him. This salvation can therefore be received by faith in the word preached, without the need for persons to achieve it for themselves.
* {{bibleref2|Zechariah|9:11}} refers to prisoners in a waterless pit. "As for you, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will free your prisoners from the waterless pit."
:The verses' reference to captives has been presented as a reflection of Yahweh's captives of the enemy in [[Book of Psalms|Psalm 68:17–18]]: "God's chariots were myriad, thousands upon thousands; from Sinai the Lord entered the holy place. You went up to its lofty height; you took captives, received slaves as tribute. No rebels can live in the presence of God."
* {{bibleref2|Isaiah|24:21-22}} also refers to spirits in prison, reminiscent of Peter's account of a visitation to spirits in prison: "And it shall come to pass in that day, that the {{LORD}} shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited."

=== Early Christian teaching ===
The Harrowing of Hell was taught by [[theology|theologians]] of the [[early church]]: St [[Melito of Sardis]] (died c. 180) in his ''Homily on the Passover'' and more explicitly in his ''Homily for Holy Saturday''; [[Tertullian]] (''A Treatise on the Soul'', 55), [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] (''Treatise on Christ and Anti-Christ'') [[Origen]] (''[[Against Celsus]]'', 2:43), and, later, St [[Ambrose]] (died 397) all wrote of the Harrowing of Hell. The early heretic [[Marcion]] and his followers also discussed the Harrowing of Hell, as mentioned by Tertullian, [[Irenaeus]], and [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]]. The 6th-century [[Christolytes]], as recorded by [[John of Damascus]], believed that Jesus left his soul and body in hell, and only rose with his divinity to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0368&amp;q1=christolytes|title=History of Science: Cyclopædia, or, An universal dictionary of arts and sciences: Chose - clause|last=|first=|date=|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gospel of Matthew relates that immediately after Christ died, the earth shook, there was [[Crucifixion darkness|darkness]], the veil in the Temple was torn in two, and many people rose from the dead and walked about in Jerusalem and were seen by many people there. According to the apocryphal [[Acts of Pilate|Gospel of Nicodemus]], the Harrowing of Hell was foreshadowed by Christ's raising of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] from the dead prior to his own crucifixion. The hymns proper to the weekend suggest that as he did on earth, [[John the Baptist]] prepared the way for Jesus in Hell by prophesying to the spirits held there that Christ would soon save them.
[[File:Christ's_Descent_into_Limbo_by_Dürer.png|thumb|upright|''Christ's Descent into Limbo'', woodcut by [[Albrecht Dürer]], c. 1510]]
[[Image:5part-icon-Hell.jpg|thumb|right|[[Russian icon]] of John the Baptist foretelling the descent of Christ to the righteous in [[Hell in Christianity|Hades]] (17th century, [[Solovetsky Monastery]]).]]

In the ''[[Acts of Pilate]]''—usually incorporated with the widely read medieval ''Gospel of Nicodemus''—texts built around an original that might have been as old as the 3rd century AD with many improvements and embroidered interpolations, chapters 17 to 27 are called the ''Decensus Christi ad Inferos.'' They contain a dramatic dialogue between Hades and prince [[Satan]], and the entry of the King of Glory, imagined as from within [[Tartarus]]. &lt;!-- nothing about "Lazarus is said to have prophesied to those in Hell both about his own imminent resurrection and Christ's coming resurrection and victory" however --&gt; 

The richest, most circumstantial accounts of the Harrowing of Hell are found in medieval dramatic literature, such as the four great cycles of English [[mystery play]]s which each devote a separate scene to depict it, or in passing references in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]''. The subject is found also in the Cornish mystery plays and the York and Wakefield cycles. These medieval versions of the story do not derive from the bare suggestion made in the Epistle ascribed to Peter, but come from the ''Gospel of Nicodemus.''&lt;ref&gt;"The Apocryphal New Testament" edited by Prof JK Elliott 1993 {{ISBN|0-19-826182-9}} pp164&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptions of the afterlife ==
{{main|Afterlife}} {{refimprove|date=January 2017}}
The [[Old Testament]] view of the afterlife was that all people, whether righteous or unrighteous,  went to [[Sheol]] when they died. No Hebrew figure ever descended into Sheol and returned, although an apparition of the recently deceased Samuel briefly appeared to Saul when summoned by the [[Witch of Endor]]. [[Sheol#Sheol in the intertestamental literature|Several works]] from the [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple period]] elaborate the concept of Sheol, dividing it into sections based on the righteousness or unrighteousness of those who have died.

The New Testament maintains a distinction between Sheol, the common "place of the dead", and the eternal destiny of those condemned at the [[Final Judgment]], variously described as [[Gehenna]], [[Outer Darkness|"the outer darkness,"]] or a [[Lake of fire|lake of eternal fire]]. Modern English translations of the Bible maintain this distinction (e.g. by translating ''Sheol'' as "the Pit" and ''Gehenna'' as "[[Hell]]"), but the influential King James Version used the word "hell" to translate both concepts.

The [[Hellenistic]] views of heroic descent into the Underworld and successful return follow traditions that are far older than the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]] popular at the time of Christ. The [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] includes such a scene, and it appears also in ''[[Odyssey]]'' XI. Writing shortly before the birth of Jesus, [[Vergil]] included it in the ''[[Aeneid]]''. What little we know of the [[worship]] in mystery religions such as the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] and [[Mithraism]] suggests that a ritual death and rebirth of the initiate was an important part of their [[liturgy]]. Again, this has earlier parallels, in particular with the worship of [[Osiris]]. The ancient homily on ''The Lord's Descent into Hell'' may mirror these traditions by referring to [[baptism]] as a symbolic death and rebirth. (''cf.'' {{bibleref2|Colossians|2:9–15}}) Or, these traditions of [[Mithraism]] may be drawn from early Christian homilies.

== Interpretations of the doctrine ==

===Catholicism===
[[Image:HarrowingBermejo.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''Christ leads the patriarchs from Hell to Paradise'', by Bartolomeo Bertejo, Spanish, ca 1480: [[Methuselah]], [[Solomon]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]], and [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] and [[Eve]] lead the procession of the righteous behind Christ.]]

There is an ancient [[homily]] on the subject, of unknown authorship, usually entitled ''The Lord's Descent into Hell'' that is the second reading at Office of Readings on [[Holy Saturday]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/spirit/documents/spirit_20010414_omelia-sabato-santo_en.html The Lord's descent into hell]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' states: "By the expression 'He descended into Hell', the Apostles' Creed confesses that Jesus did really die and through his death for us conquered death and the devil 'who has the power of death' ({{bibleref2|Hebrews|2:14}}). In his human soul united to his divine person, the dead Christ went down to the realm of the dead. He opened Heaven's gates for the just who had gone before him."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p122a5p1.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church]'', p. 636–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Catechism says, the word "Hell"—from the Norse, ''Hel''; in Latin, ''infernus, infernum, inferi''; in Greek, {{lang|grc|ᾍδης}} ([[Hell in Christianity|Hades]]); in Hebrew, ''שאול'' (Sheol)—is used in Scripture and the Apostles' Creed to refer to the abode of all the dead, whether righteous or evil, unless or until they are admitted to Heaven (CCC 633). This abode of the dead is the "Hell" into which the Creed says Christ descended. His death freed from exclusion from Heaven the just who had gone before him: "It is precisely these holy souls who awaited their Savior in Abraham's bosom whom Christ the Lord delivered when he descended into Hell", the Catechism states (CCC 633), echoing the words of the [[Roman Catechism]], 1,6,3. His death was of no avail to the damned.

Conceptualization of the abode of the dead as a place, though possible and customary, is not obligatory (Church documents, such as catechisms, speak of a "state or place"). Some maintain that Christ did not go to the  place of the damned, which is what is generally understood today by the word "Hell". For instance, [[Thomas Aquinas]] taught that Christ did not descend into the "Hell of the lost" in his essence, but only by the effect of his death, through which "he put them to shame for their unbelief and wickedness: but to them who were detained in [[Purgatory]] he gave hope of attaining to glory: while upon the holy Fathers detained in Hell solely on account of [[original sin]], he shed the light of glory everlasting."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4052.htm Summa Theologica, III, 52, art. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

While some maintain that Christ merely descended into the "limbo of the fathers", others, notably theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] (inspired by the visions of [[Adrienne von Speyr]]), maintain that it was more than this and that the descent involved suffering by Jesus.&lt;ref name=Reno&gt;Reno, R.R. [http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/?p=1192 Was Balthasar a Heretic?] First Things, October 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Some maintain that this is a matter on which differences and theological speculation are permissible without transgressing the limits of orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=Reno/&gt; However, Balthasar's point here has been forcefully condemned by conservative Catholic outlets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchmilitant.tv/dispatches/emptyhell/ "Massa Damnata"]. ChurchMilitant.TV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://taylormarshall.com/2013/03/did-christ-suffer-in-hell-when-he.html Did Christ Suffer in Hell When He Descended into Hell?]. Taylor Marshall.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodoxy===
[[Image:Anastasis at Chora.jpg|thumb|300px|In ''Harrowing of Hades'', fresco in the ''parecclesion'' of the [[Chora Church]], [[Istanbul]], c. 1315, raising Adam and Eve is depicted as part of the Resurrection icon, as it always is in the East.]]

Saint [[John Chrysostom]]'s [[Paschal Homily]] also addresses the Harrowing of Hades, and is typically read during the [[Paschal Vigil]], the climactic service of the Orthodox celebration of [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter).

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the Harrowing of Hades is celebrated annually on [[Holy and Great Saturday]], during the [[Vespers|Vesperal]] [[Divine Liturgy of Saint Basil]] as is normative for the [[Byzantine Rite]]. At the beginning of the service, the [[antependium|hangings]] in the church and the [[vestment]]s worn by the clergy are all somber [[Great Lent|Lenten]] colours (usually purple or black). Then, just before the [[Gospel]] reading, the [[liturgical colors]] are changed white and the deacon performs a [[censing]], and the priest strews [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] leaves around the church, symbolizing the broken gates of hell; this is done in celebration of the harrowing of Hades then taking place, and in anticipation of Christ's imminent resurrection.

The Harrowing of Hades is generally more common and prominent in Orthodox [[iconography]] compared to the Western tradition. It is the traditional [[icon]] for [[Holy Saturday]], and is used during the [[Paschal season]] and on Sundays throughout the year.

The traditional Orthodox icon of the [[Resurrection of Jesus]], partially inspired by the apocryphal ''[[Gospel of Nicodemus|Acts of Pilate]]'' (4th c.), does not depict simply the physical act of Jesus's coming out of the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]], but rather it reveals what Orthodox Christians believe to be the spiritual reality of what his [[Death and resurrection of Jesus|Death and Resurrection]] accomplished.

The icon depicts Jesus, vested in white and gold to symbolize his divine majesty, standing on the brazen gates of Hades (also called the "Doors of Death"), which are broken and have fallen in the form of a cross, illustrating the belief that by his death on the cross, Jesus "trampled down death by death" (see [[Paschal troparion]]). He is holding [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] and [[Eve]] and pulling them up out of Hades. Traditionally, he is not shown holding them by the hands, but by their wrists, to illustrate the theological teaching that mankind could not pull himself out of his [[original sin|original]] or [[ancestral sin]], but that it could come about only by the work (''[[Essence-Energies distinction|energia]]'') of God. Jesus is surrounded by various righteous figures from the [[Old Testament]] ([[Abraham]], [[David]], etc.); the bottom of the icon depicts Hades as a chasm of darkness, often with various pieces of broken locks and chains strewn about. Quite frequently, one or two figures are shown in the darkness, bound in chains, who are generally identified as personifications of [[Death]] or the [[Devil]].

===Lutheranism===

[[Martin Luther]], in a sermon delivered in Torgau in 1533, stated that Christ descended into Hell.

The [[Formula of Concord]] (a Lutheran confession) states, "we believe simply that the entire person, God and human being, descended to Hell after his burial, conquered the devil, destroyed the power of Hell, and took from the devil all his power." (Solid Declaration, Art. IX)

Many attempts were made following Luther's death to systematize his theology of the descensus, whether Christ descended in victory or humiliation. For Luther, however, the defeat or "[[Humiliation of Christ|humiliation]]" of Christ is never fully separable from His victorious glorification. Some argued that Christ's suffering was completed with His words from the cross, "It is finished."{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Luther himself, when pressed to elaborate on the question of whether Christ descended to Hell in humiliation or victory responded, "It is enough to preach the article to the laypeople as they have learned to know it in the past from the stained glass and other sources."{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Calvinism===
[[John Calvin]] expressed his concern that many Christians "have never earnestly considered what it is or means that we have been redeemed from God's judgment. Yet this is our wisdom: duly to feel how much our salvation cost the Son of God." 

Calvin's conclusion is that "If any persons have scruples about admitting this article into the Creed, it will soon be made plain how important it is to the sum of our redemption: if it is left out, much of the benefit of Christ’s death will be lost."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformed.org/master/index.html?mainframe=/documents/Christ_in_hell/index.html Center for Reformed Theology and Apologetics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin strongly opposed the notion that Christ freed prisoners, as opposed to traveling to Hell as part of completing his sufferings (Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book 2, chapter 16, sections 8-10),

The [[Calvinism|Reformed]] interpret the phrase "he descended into Hell" as referring to Christ's pain and humiliation ''prior'' to his death, and that this humiliation had a spiritual dimension as part of God's judgement upon the sin which he bore on behalf of Christians. The doctrine of Christ's humiliation is also meant to assure believers that Christ has redeemed them from the pain and suffering of God's judgment on sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=R. Michael|title=Reformed Theology|year=2012|pages=67{{ndash}}68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mormonism===
{{main|Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)}}
The Harrowing of Hell has been a unique and important doctrine among members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] since its founding in 1830 by [[Joseph Smith]], although members of the church ("[[Mormons]]") usually call it by other terms, such as "Christ's visit to the spirit world." Like Christian exegetes distinguishing between [[Sheol]] and [[Gehenna]], Latter-day Saints distinguish between the realm of departed spirits (the "[[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)|spirit world]]") and the portion (or state) of the wicked ("[[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)#Spirit prison|spirit prison]]"). The portion or state of the righteous is often referred to as "paradise".

Perhaps the most notable aspect of Latter-day Saint beliefs regarding the Harrowing of Hell is their view on the purpose of it, both for the just and the wicked. [[Joseph F. Smith]], the sixth president of the Church, explained in what is now a canonized revelation, that when Christ died, "there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of the spirits of the just, ... rejoicing together because the day of their deliverance was at hand. They were assembled awaiting the advent of the Son of God into the spirit world, to declare their redemption from the bands of death" ([[Doctrine and Covenants|D&amp;C]] {{lds||dc|138|12|,15-16|||x}}).

In the LDS view, while Christ announced freedom from physical death to the just, he had another purpose in descending to Hell regarding the wicked. "The Lord went not in person among the wicked and the disobedient who had rejected the truth, to teach them; but behold, from among the righteous, he organized his forces…and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel preached to the dead ... to those who had died in their sins, without a knowledge of the truth, or in transgression, having rejected the prophets" ({{lds|D&amp;C|dc|138|29|30,32}}). From the Latter-day Saint viewpoint, the rescue of spirits was not a one-time event but an ongoing process that still continues ({{lds|D&amp;C|dc|138}}; {{lds|1 Peter|1-pet|4|6}}). This concept goes hand-in-hand with the doctrine of [[baptism for the dead]], which is based on the LDS belief that those who choose to accept the gospel in the spirit world must still receive the saving ordinances in order to dwell in the kingdom of God ({{lds|Mark|mark|16|16}}; {{lds|John|john|3|5}}; {{lds|1 Peter|1-pet|3|21}}). These baptisms and other ordinances are performed in LDS temples, wherein a church member is baptized vicariously, or in behalf of, those who died without being baptized by proper authority. The recipients in the spirit world then have the opportunity to accept or reject this baptism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://mormon.org/faq/topic/baptism/question/baptism-for-the-dead |title=Why do Mormons perform baptisms for the dead? |department=Frequently Asked Questions |website=Mormon.org |publisher=LDS Church |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213103405/http://mormon.org/faq/topic/baptism/question/baptism-for-the-dead |archive-date=2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rejection of the doctrine==
A number of Christians reject the doctrine of the "harrowing of hell", claiming that "there is scant scriptural evidence for [it], and that Jesus's own words contradict it".&lt;ref name="burke"&gt;Daniel Burke, '[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/what-did-jesus-do-on-holy-saturday/2012/04/02/gIQATLMSrS_story.html What did Jesus do on Holy Saturday?]' in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 2, 2012 (accessed 14/01/2013)&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]], for example, says "there is no textual [i.e. Biblical] basis for believing that Christ descended into hell", and, therefore, Piper does not recite the "he descended into hell" phrase when saying the Apostles' Creed.&lt;ref&gt;John Piper, '[http://www.christianpost.com/news/did-christ-ever-descend-to-hell-49959/ Did Christ Ever Descend to Hell?]' in ''[[The Christian Post]]'' April 23, 2011 (accessed 14/01/2013)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wayne Grudem]] also skips the phrase when reciting the Creed; he says that the "single argument in ... favor [of the "harrowing of hell" clause in the Creed] seems to be that it has been around so long. ... But an old mistake is still a mistake".&lt;ref name="burke"/&gt; In his book ''Raised with Christ'', Pentecostal Adrian Warnock agrees with Grudem, commenting, "Despite some translations of an ancient creed [i.e. the Apostles' Creed], which suggest that Jesus ... 'descended into hell', there is no biblical evidence to suggest that he actually did so."&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Warnock, ''Raised with Christ'' (Wheaton: Crossway, 2010), p. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354–430) argued that 1 Peter 3:19–20, the chief passage used to support the doctrine of the "harrowing of hell", is "more allegory than history".&lt;ref name="burke"/&gt;

===Christian mortalism===
The above views share the traditional Christian belief in the [[immortality of the soul]]. The [[Christian mortalism|mortalist]] view of the [[intermediate state]] requires an alternative view of the {{bibleref2|Acts|2:27}} and {{bibleref2|Acts|2:31}}, taking a view of the [[New Testament]] use of [[Hell]] as equivalent to use of [[Hell in Christianity|Hades]] in the [[Septuagint]] and therefore to [[Sheol]] in the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman T. Burns, ''Christian Mortalism from Tyndale to Milton'' 1972 p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Tyndale]] and [[Martin Bucer]] of Strassburg argued that Hades in Acts 2 was merely a metaphor for the grave. Other reformers [[Christopher Carlisle]] and [[Walter Deloenus]] in London, argued for the article to be dropped from the creed.&lt;ref&gt;''Descent into Hell'' in ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: A-D'' ed. and article Geoffrey W. Bromiley pp. 926-927.&lt;/ref&gt; The Harrowing of Hell was a major scene in traditional depictions of Christ's life avoided by [[John Milton]] due to his mortalist views.&lt;ref&gt;William Bridges Hunter ''Milton's English poetry: being entries from A Milton encyclopedia'' p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortalist interpretations of the Acts 2 statements of Christ being in Hades are also found among later Anglicans such as [[E. W. Bullinger]].&lt;ref&gt;E. W. Bullinger "Hell" in ''A Critical Lexicon and Concordance to the English and Greek New Testament'' pp. 367-369.&lt;/ref&gt;

While those holding mortalist views on the soul would agree on the "harrowing of hell" concerning souls, that there were no conscious dead for Christ to literally visit, the question of whether Christ himself was also dead, unconscious, brings different answers:
* To most [[Protestant]] advocates of "[[soul sleep]]" such as [[Martin Luther]], Christ himself was not in the same condition as the dead, and while his body was in Hades, Christ, as second person of the Trinity, was conscious in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Hagen. ''A theology of Testament in the young Luther: the lectures on Hebrews'' 1974 p95 "For Luther it refers to God's abandonment of Christ during the three days of his death:"&lt;/ref&gt;
* To Christian mortalists who are also [[non-Trinitarian]], such as [[Socinians]] and [[Christadelphians]],&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker H.A. ''Studies in the Gospels''&lt;/ref&gt; the maxim "the dead know nothing" includes also Christ during the three days.

Of the three days, Christ says "I was dead" (Greek ''egenomen nekros'' ἐγενόμην νεκρὸς, Latin ''fui mortuus'').{{Bibleref2c|Revelation|1:18}}

===Drama===
* The earliest surviving Christian drama probably intended to be performed is the ''[[Harrowing of Hell (drama)|Harrowing of Hell]]'' found in the 8th-century ''[[Book of Cerne]]''.

===Literature===
* In [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'' the Harrowing of Hell is mentioned in Canto IV by the pilgrim's guide [[Virgil]]. Virgil was in Hell in the first place because he was not exposed to Christianity in his lifetime, and therefore he actually describes in generic terms Christ as a "mighty one" who rescued the Hebrew forefathers of Christianity, but left him behind in the very same circle. It is clear that he does not fully understand the significance of the event, as Dante does.
* An incomplete [[Middle English]] telling of the Harrowing of Hell is found in the [[Auchinleck manuscript]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Auchinleck.nls.uk|url=http://auchinleck.nls.uk/mss/harrow.html|title=Auchinleck manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although the [[Orpheus|Orfeo]] legend has its origin in pagan antiquity, the Medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] of [[Sir Orfeo]] has often been interpreted as drawing parallels between the Greek hero and Jesus freeing souls from Hell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry, Elisabeth |title=Orpheus with His Lute: Poetry and the Renewal of Life|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|date= 1992|pages= 38, 50–53, 81}} ''et passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Treharne, Elaine|title=Speaking of the Medieval|work=The Oxford Handbook of Medieval Literature in English|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 2010|page= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the explication of Orpheus' descent and return from the Underworld as an allegory for Christ's as early as the ''[[Pierre Bersuire|Ovide Moralisé]]'' (1340).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedman, John Block |title=Orpheus in the Middle Ages|publisher=Syracuse University Press|date= 2000|pages= 125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Stephen Lawhead]]'s novel ''Byzantium'' (1997), a young [[Irish monk]] is asked to explain Jesus' life to a group of [[Vikings]], who were particularly impressed with Jesus' "[[Descent to the underworld]]" (''Helreið'').
[[File:Follower of Jheronimus Bosch Christ in Limbo.jpg|thumb|''Christ in Limbo'', by a follower of [[Hieronymus Bosch]]]]

Parallels in Jewish literature reference legends of Enoch and Abraham's harrowings of the Underworld, unrelated to Christian themes. These have been updated in [[Isaac Leib Peretz]]'s short story "[[Neilah]] in [[Gehenna]]", in which a Jewish [[hazzan]] descends to Hell and uses his unique voice to bring about the repentance and liberation of the souls imprisoned there.

===Music===
* The Harrowing of Hell is the subject of several [[baroque]] [[oratorio]]s,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} most notably [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri]]'s ''Gesù al Limbo'' (1803) to a text by Luigi Prividali.&lt;ref&gt;Recording and essay with Il Giudizio Finale; Te Deum. dir Alberto Turco, Bongiovanni&lt;/ref&gt;

* A follower of [[Hieronymus Bosch]] depicts Christ in Limbo in a vivid composition, now owned by the Indianapolis Museum of Art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christ in Limbo|url=http://collection.imamuseum.org/artwork/79340/|website=Indianapolis Museum of Art|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of the [[Jews]] in [[Belmonte (Portugal)|Belmonte]]''', [[Portugal]], reaches back over six hundred years.

==Belmonte marranos==
{{main|Marrano|Converso}}
[[File:Museu Judaico de Belmonte.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jewish Museum of Belmonte (''Museu Judaico de Belmonte'').]]
The [[marrano]]s that have been living in Belmonte are sometimes referred to as the "Belmonte Jews." They are a community that has survived in secrecy for hundreds of years by maintaining a tradition of [[endogamy]] and by hiding all the external signs of their faith. 

The community in the municipality of [[Belmonte (Portugal)|Belmonte]], [[Cova da Beira Subregion|Cova da Beira]] subregion, [[Portugal]], goes back to the 12th century and they were only discovered in 1917 by a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] mining engineer named Samuel Schwarz. Some of them resumed the public practice of [[Judaism]] in the 1970s, and opened a [[synagogue]], ''Bet Eliahu'', in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-jewish-story.org/belmonte.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Belmonte Project was founded under the auspices of the [[American Sephardi Federation]], in order to raise funds to acquire Judaic educational material and services for the community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansephardifederation.org/PDF/newsletter/spring2003.pdf|title=SEPHARDIM TODAY|publisher=americansephardifederation.org|pages=9|accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which now numbers 300).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/12391/|title=After 500 Years in Hiding, Jews Bring Prosperity to Iberian Town|last=Nolan|first=Rachel |date=3 January|publisher=forward.com|accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Jewish Museum of Belmonte (''Museu Judaico de Belmonte'') &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cm-belmonte.pt/Museujudaico/museujudaco.html www.cm-belmonte.pt/Museujudaico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726015013/http://www.cm-belmonte.pt/Museujudaico/museujudaco.html |date=2010-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; opened on 17 April 2005. 

A preserved [[Hebrew]] synagogal inscription from Belmonte, dating from 1296-1297, was found which likely was intended to be placed above the synagogue ark.&lt;ref name="bh.org.il"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Belmonte |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/belmonte |publisher=[[The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot]] |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2006, the [[American Sephardi Federation]] ceased to have the Belmonte Project under its auspices. Their [[Sephardi]]c tradition of [[Crypto-Judaism]] is considered unique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2738534,00.html www.dw-world.de/dw/article]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Annyas]] (or Anes)—a descendant of a Marrano family from Belmonte who immigrated to [[Ireland]]—became the Mayor of [[Youghal]] in [[County Cork]] in 1555, the first person of the Jewish religion to hold such an elected position in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Affairs1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ireland.

His work included paintings, drawings and [[linocut]]s, of which he was an early pioneer. An associate in his early career of many leading artists working in Britain of his period, including [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]], [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]], and members of the [[Vorticism]] movement, he ended his life relatively neglected.

==Early life==
Brodzky was born in [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]], [[Melbourne]] in 1885 to the Australian journalist Maurice Brodzky (a [[Jew]]ish immigrant to Australia from Poland), and his wife Flora, née Leon.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"&gt;Lambirth (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth he assisted his father in the production of the magazine ''Table Talk''.&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;Cannon (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

Brodzky studied initially at the [[National Gallery of Victoria Art School|National Gallery School]] in Melbourne.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt; In 1904 his father was bankrupted after exposing corruption, and Horace moved with his family to San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt;

==London==
In 1908, Brodzky went to London where he studied during 1911 at the [[City and Guilds of London Art School|City and Guilds South London Technical Art School]]. He became an acquaintance and follower of [[Walter Sickert]]. Amongst his friends was Henri Gaudier-Brzeska who created in 1913 a [[portrait bust]] of Brodzky (now in the [[Tate Gallery]], London), and whose biography he wrote in 1933.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/search?q=Brodzky "Brodzky"], ''Tate Gallery'' website, accessed 29 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Brodzky is said to have been so engrossed in talk when he visited Gaudier-Brzeska's studio in the [[King's Road]], that he missed the last bus to [[Herne Hill]] where he lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicholson|first1=Virginia|title=Among the Bohemians: Experiments in Living 1900-1939|date=2003|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=0141933402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brodzky travelled to Italy with the poet  [[John Gould Fletcher]]  and this led to his first London exhibition, "Paintings and Sketches of Italian and Sicilian Scenes" (c. 1911), of which one painting was selected for the 1912 [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt;  He was in fact the first Australian to be exhibited at the Biennale.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt; In 1914 his work was exhibited along with that of other Jewish artists, including Mark Gertler and [[David Bomberg]], in the [[Whitechapel Gallery]]. Brodzky became a member of [[The London Group]].&lt;ref name="lag"&gt;[http://www.londonartsgroup.com/Artist-Info.cfm?ArtistsID=355&amp;Collection=&amp;info=CV "Horace Brodzky"], London Arts Group website accessed 2 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he was a pioneer of the technique of linocut, in which medium he has been said to have "excelled". His early oils reveal the influence of both Gertler and Bomberg.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weindling"&gt;Weindling (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Among his works of this period are portraits of [[Jacob Epstein]] and [[Jacob Kramer]].&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;

==New York==
In 1915 Brodzky moved to New York, with an introduction to the art patron [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]].&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt; There he worked as a poster artist and an arts journalist,&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt; and in 1917 helped Quinn organize a New York exhibition of Vorticist artists. In 1919 he married Bertha Greenfield; they were to have three sons.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt; In 1920 [[Egmont Arens]] published in New York a collection of 21 of Brodzky's linoprints. Brodzky also designed [[book jacket]]s for writers including [[Eugene O'Neill]] and [[Theodore Dreiser]],&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt; and painted a portrait of O'Neill.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;

==Back to England==
Returning to London in 1923 he became a professional artist. His work featured in the first-ever exhibition of linocuts, organized by [[Claude Flight]] at the [[Redfern Gallery]] in  1929.&lt;ref name="Anon2"&gt;Anon 2 (n.d)&lt;/ref&gt; Initial success however withered in the 1930s, when his marriage broke up, and from then on he lived in financial straits. In 1935 [[James Laver]] published a study  ''Forty Drawings by Horace Brodzky''. Laver described Brodzky's drawing technique as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Brodzky prefers the ordinary 'dip-in' steel nib, for this enables the hand, by varying its pressure on the paper, to broaden the line at will, or rather in obedience to the obscure subconscious or half-conscious promptings which guide the hand to its task. He makes no preliminary studies, draws no pencil outline, carefully rubbed out afterwards to give a false impression of spontaneity. There are no erasures or alterations. Each drawing is made 'au premier coup'. It is made very quickly, as a unity, and when finished the artist cannot remember at what point it was started. The drawing has been thrown on the paper, as it were, with a single gesture.&lt;ref name="lag"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1946 Brodzky published his own study of the French-Romanian-Jewish artist [[Pascin|Jules Pascin]]. In London he lived for most of the rest of his life in the [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] and [[Willesden]] areas, continuing to produce paintings, drawings and linocuts. He supported himself by teaching and painting stage-decor and from 1948 to 1962 he was art-editor of the ''Antique Dealer and Collector's Guide'', (founded by his brother Adrian).&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt;

==Final years==
In 1963, Brodzky wrote to the collector [[Ruth Borchard]], who had just purchased from him a self-portrait for the sum of 12 guineas (₤12.60):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since 1911 I have been connected with the London art world &amp; have exhibited at all important exhibitions…and have worked for modern art... For a long time I have sold none of my work &amp; have had to rely on selling items by other artists that I have collected…This letter is not an angry complaint but just the plain facts that I thought you might like to know.&lt;ref&gt;Anon 1 (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1965 80th anniversary exhibitions were organized for Brodzky at the [[Ben Uri Gallery]] and the [[Oxford Union]] Cellars.&lt;ref name="Anon2"/&gt; In 1967 some of his early linocuts were reissued in London in a signed edition of 60 prints. Brodzky died in Kilburn in 1969, when his estate was valued for [[probate]] at £7977.&lt;ref name="Lambirth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt; Exhibitions of Brodzky's work were held in the [[Jewish Museum of Australia]] (1988) and at the Boundary Gallery, London (1989).&lt;ref name="Anon2"/&gt;

According to all four [[schools of Sunni law]] and Shia law, [[interfaith marriage]]s are condoned only between a Muslim male and a non-Muslim female from the [[People of the Book]] (that is, [[Christians]] and [[Jews]]) and not vice versa. In many Muslim majority countries, interfaith marriages (apart from marriages of Muslim men to Jewish-or-Christian women) are prohibited, and/or regarded as socially taboo. 

In some diaspora societies, interfaith marriages between Muslims and non-Muslims take place at substantial rates, including marriages that contradict the 
sharia consensus. For example, in the United States, about one in ten Muslim women are married to non-Muslims, including about one in six Muslim women under 40 and about 20% of Muslim women who describe themselves as less devoutly religious.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/identity-assimilation-and-community/pf_2017-06-26_muslimamericans-02new-04/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage of Muslim men to non-Muslim women==
Islamic marriage rules between Muslim men and non-Muslim women are regulated by Islamic principles. There are restrictions to whom a Muslim man can marry which are further explained below.


According to Qur'an (5:5)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Noble Qur'an|url=https://quran.com/5/5|website=quran.com|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;,
"''This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. '''And [lawful in marriage are] chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture before you, when you have given them their due compensation, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [secret] lovers.''' And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers''". From this verse, it can be understood that Muslim men are allowed to marry non-Muslim women from the [[People of the Book]] (i.e. the Jews and Christians).


However, the Quran (2:221)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Noble Qur'an|url=https://quran.com/2/221|website=quran.com|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also states,
"'''''And do not marry Polytheist women until they believe,  And a believing slave woman is better than a Polytheist women, even though she might please you. And do not marry Polytheist men [to your women] until they believe. And a believing slave is better than a Polytheist men, even though he might please you. Those invite [you] to the Fire, but Allah invites to Paradise and to forgiveness, by His permission. And He makes clear His verses to the people that perhaps they may remember''". From this verse, it can be understood that Muslim men are not allowed to marry women who associate or similarise Allah with anything.


Having all the above verses taken into account, it can be concluded that Muslim men can marry non-Muslim women with following conditions:
*  Muslim man can marry the women from the [[People of the Book]] (i.e. the Jews and Christians)
*  Muslim man cannot marry polytheist women

==Marriage of Muslim women to non-Muslim men ==

Interfaith marriage between Muslim women and non-Muslim men has been a highly sensitive topic across the Muslim world for centuries, as it is considered to be a violation of Islamic law by the consensus of scholars. Although there are changes, it is still banned in many Muslim societies. While the law permits a Muslim man to marry a non-Muslim woman, it does not allow a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man without proof of his conversion to Islam. Almost all Islamic nations prohibit it. Tunisia is one of the few Muslim majority countries where Muslim women are allowed to marry non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41278610&lt;/ref&gt;

In parts of the diaspora, interfaith marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslims take place at substantial rates, in contradiction to the sharia consensus. For example, in the United States, about 10% of Muslim women are married to non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/identity-assimilation-and-community/pf_2017-06-26_muslimamericans-02new-04/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to Islam of one spouse in a non-Muslim marriage==
Under Islamic law, if a non-Muslim woman is married to a non-Muslim, and she converts to Islam, the marriage is suspended until her husband converts to Islam. She could, in theory, leave the non-Muslim husband and marry a Muslim one. If the non-Muslim husband does convert a new marriage is not needed. In the Quran, it is said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;O ye who believe! When there come to you believing women refugees, examine (and test) them: God knows best as to their Faith: if ye ascertain that they are Believers, then send them not back to the Unbelievers. '''They are not lawful (wives) for the Unbelievers, nor are the (Unbelievers) lawful (husbands) for them'''. But pay the Unbelievers what they have spent (on their dower), and there will be no blame on you if ye marry them on payment of their dower to them. But hold not to the guardianship of unbelieving women: ask for what ye have spent on their dowers, and let the (Unbelievers) ask for what they have spent (on the dowers of women who come over to you). Such is the command of God. He judges (with justice) between you. And God is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom. {Surah 60:10}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern practice==
In practice, many Arab countries allowed interfaith marriage to Christian or Jewish women but not to non-Muslim men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wluml.org/english/pubs/rtf/dossiers/dossier22/D22-13-psl.rtf The Need to Unify Personal Status Laws in Arab Countries] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429175400/http://www.wluml.org/english/pubs/rtf/dossiers/dossier22/D22-13-psl.rtf |date=April 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lebanon]] for example there is no civil personal status law and marriages are performed according to the religion of the spouses. There, Muslim women cannot marry non-Muslim men, whereas this is possible vice versa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2012/Jun-14/176772-more-lebanese-opting-for-civil-marriage-abroad.ashx |title=More Lebanese opting for civil marriage abroad &amp;#124; News , Lebanon News |publisher=The Daily Star |date= |accessdate=2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least if the spouse is a Christian or Jewish woman. [[Turkey]] allows marriages to non-Muslim men through secular laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law2.fordham.edu/publications/articles/500flspub13019.pdf TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY LOVING: NATIONALITY, GENDER, AND RELIGION IN THE MUSLIM WORLD] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719194930/http://law2.fordham.edu/publications/articles/500flspub13019.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tunisia]] since 16 September 2017, Muslim women can lawfully marry any man of any faith, or of none.  In [[Malaysia]] a non-Muslim must convert to Islam in order to marry a Muslim. The offspring of such unions are automatically Muslims and all Malaysian Muslims are legally prohibited from leaving Islam (''[[Apostasy in Islam|Riddah]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysia.gov.my/EN/Relevant%20Topics/Society%20and%20Life/Citizen/Family/Marriage/ProcedureMarriageMuslimandNonMuslim/Pages/MarriageBetweenMuslimandNonMuslim.aspx Marriage Procedures Between Muslim and Non-Muslim]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813113000/http://www.malaysia.gov.my/EN/Relevant%20Topics/Society%20and%20Life/Citizen/Family/Marriage/ProcedureMarriageMuslimandNonMuslim/Pages/MarriageBetweenMuslimandNonMuslim.aspx |date=August 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interfaith marriage especially between [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] often have been the bone of contention and have resulted in communal riots in [[India]]. ''[[Love Jihad]]'', also called Romeo Jihad, widely regarded as a [[conspiracy theory]], is an alleged activity under which young Muslim boys and men are said to reportedly target young girls belonging to non-Muslim communities for conversion to Islam by feigning love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muzaffarnagar-love-jihad-beef-bogey-sparked-riot-flames/article1-1120889.aspx |title=Muzaffarnagar: 'Love jihad', beef bogey sparked riot flames |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=12 Sep 2013 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Stephen Brown |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/2009/stephenbrown/the-%E2%80%9Clove-jihad%E2%80%9D-by-steven-brown/ |title=The "Love Jihad" |publisher=Front Page Mag |date=2009-10-16 |accessdate=2014-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323091755/http://www.frontpagemag.com/2009/stephenbrown/the-%E2%80%9Clove-jihad%E2%80%9D-by-steven-brown/ |archivedate=2014-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Common"&gt;{{cite news|author=Ananthakrishnan G |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Love-Jihad-racket-VHP-Christian-groups-find-common-cause/articleshow/5117548.cms |title='Love Jihad' racket: VHP, Christian groups find common cause |publisher=Times of India |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/09/04/indias-fake-love-jihad/|title = India’s Fake ‘Love Jihad’|first = Siddhartha|last=Mahanta|date = 5 September 2014|work = [[Foreign Policy]]|accessdate = 24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official investigations in Uttar Pradesh had found no credence in allegations of Love Jihad that had been brought before them, with state police chief A.L. Banerjee stating that, "In most cases we found that a Hindu girl and Muslim boy were in love and had married against their parents' will. There are also  instances where Muslim girls marry Hindu 
boys under the Special Marriage Act, 1954.

[[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] '''John Frederick Charles''' "'''Boney'''" '''Fuller''', [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (1 September 1878 – 10 February 1966) was a senior [[British Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]], [[military history|military historian]], and [[military strategy|strategist]], notable as an early theorist of modern [[armoured warfare]], including categorizing [[Principles of Warfare|principles of warfare]]. With 45 books and many articles, he was a highly prolific author whose ideas reached army officers and the interested public. He explored the business of fighting, in terms of the relationship between warfare and social, political, and economic factors in the civilian sector. Fuller emphasized the potential of new weapons, especially tanks and aircraft, to stun a surprised enemy psychologically.

Fuller was highly controversial in British politics because of his support for the organized fascist movement. He was also an [[occult]]ist and [[Thelema|Thelemite]] who wrote a number of works on [[esotericism]] and [[mysticism]].

==Early life==
Fuller was born in [[Chichester]], [[West Sussex]] and is the son of an Anglican clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Spencer C., ''The European Powers in the First World War: An Encyclopedia'', Routledge, 2013, {{ISBN|1135507015}}, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;  After moving to [[Lausanne]] with his parents as a boy, he returned to England at the age of 11 without them; three years later, at "the somewhat advanced age of 14", he began attending [[Malvern College]]&lt;ref name="Memoirs"&gt;Fuller, ''Memoirs of an Unconventional Soldier'', Ivor Nicholson and Watson Ltd., London, 1936, ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and, later trained for an army career at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], from 1897 to 1898. His nickname of "Boney", which he was to retain, is said to have come either from an admiration for [[Napoleon Bonaparte]],&lt;ref&gt;Brian Holden Reid, "J. F. C. Fuller: Military Thinker", Macmillan, 1987, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; or from an imperious manner combined with military brilliance which resembled Napoleon's.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trevor N. Dupuy]], Curt Johnson, David L. Bongard, ''[[Harper Encyclopedia of Military Biography]]'', HarperCollins, 1992, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Fuller was commissioned into the 1st Battalion of the [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry|Oxfordshire Light Infantry]] (the old [[43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot|43rd Foot]]), and served in [[South Africa]] from 1899 to 1902.  In the spring of 1904 Fuller was sent with his unit to India, where he contracted [[typhoid fever]] in autumn of 1905; he returned to England the next year on sick-leave, where he met the woman he married in December 1906.&lt;ref name="Memoirs"/&gt; Instead of returning to India, he was reassigned to units in England, serving as an [[adjutant]] to the 2nd South Middlesex Volunteers (amalgamated into the 7th Middlesex during the [[Haldane Reforms]]) and helping form the 10th Middlesex, until he was accepted into the Staff College at [[Camberley]] in 1913, starting work there in January 1914.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Trythall,  ''"Boney" Fuller: The Intellectual General'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War I|First World War]], Fuller was a staff officer with the Home Forces and with 7 Corps in France, and from 1916 in the Headquarters of the [[Machine-Gun Corps]]' Heavy Branch which was later to become the [[Royal Tank Regiment|Tank Corps]].  He helped plan the tank attack at the 20 November 1917 [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] and the tank operations for the Autumn offensives of 1918.  His [[Plan 1919]] for a fully mechanised offensive against the German army was never implemented.  After 1918 he held various leading positions, notably as a commander of an experimental brigade at [[Aldershot]].

After the war Fuller collaborated with his junior [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] in developing new ideas for the [[mechanisation]] of armies, 
launching a crusade for the mechanization and modernization of the British Army.  Chief instructor of [[Camberley Staff College]] from 1923, he became military assistant to the chief of the Imperial General Staff in 1926.  
In what came to be known as the "Tidworth Incident", Fuller turned down the command of the [[Experimental Mechanized Force]], which was formed on August 27, 1927.  The appointment also carried responsibility for a regular infantry brigade and the garrison of [[Tidworth Camp]] on [[Salisbury Plain]].  Fuller believed he would be unable to devote himself to the Experimental Mechanized Force and the development of mechanized warfare techniques without extra staff to assist him with the additional extraneous duties, which the [[War Office]] refused to allocate.
He was promoted to Major-General in 1930 and retired three years later to devote himself entirely to writing.&lt;ref&gt;Trythall,  ''"Boney" Fuller: The Intellectual General'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and Fascism==

After retirement, Fuller served as a reporter during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] (1935) and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39). On his retirement in 1933, impatient with what he considered the inability of democracy to adopt military reforms, Fuller became involved with Sir [[Oswald Mosley]] and the British [[Fascism|Fascist]] movement.  As a member of the [[British Union of Fascists]] he sat on the party's Policy Directorate and was considered one of Mosley's closest allies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oswaldmosley.com/j-f-c-fuller/&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a member of the clandestine [[far right]] group the [[Nordic League]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Thurlow, ''Fascism in Britain: A History, 1918-1985'', (1987), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller's ideas on mechanized warfare continued to be influential in the lead-up to the Second World War, ironically less with his countrymen than with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], notably [[Heinz Guderian]] who spent his own money to have Fuller's ''Provisional Instructions for Tank and Armoured Car Training'' translated.&lt;ref name="atkin1990"&gt;{{cite book | title=Pillar of Fire: Dunkirk 1940 | publisher=Birlinn Limited | author=Atkin, Ronald | year=1990 | location=Edinburgh | page=26 | isbn=1 84158 078 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1930s the German [[Wehrmacht|Army]] implemented tactics similar in many ways to Fuller's analysis, which became known as [[Blitzkrieg]].  Like Fuller, theorists of Blitzkrieg partly based their approach on the theory that areas of large enemy activity should be bypassed to be eventually surrounded and destroyed.  Blitzkrieg-style tactics were used by several nations throughout the Second World War, predominantly by the Germans in the invasion of Poland (1939), Western Europe (1940), and the Soviet Union (1941).  While Germany and to some degree the Western Allies adopted Blitzkrieg ideas, they were not much used by the [[Red Army]], which developed its armored warfare doctrine based on [[deep operations]], which were developed by Soviet military theorists Marshal [[Tukhachevsky|M. N. Tukhachevsky]] et al. in the 1920s based on their experiences in the First World War and the [[Russian Civil War]].

Fuller was the only foreigner present at Nazi Germany's first armed manoeuvres in 1935.  Fuller frequently praised Adolf Hitler in his speeches and articles, once describing him as "that realistic idealist who has awakened the common sense of the British people by setting out to create a new Germany".&lt;ref name ="McKinstry"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKinstry|first=Leo|title=Operation Sealion|publisher=John Murray|year=2014|isbn=978-1-84854-704-9}} (p. 217)&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 1939 Fuller was an honoured guest at Hitler's 50th birthday parade, watching as "for three hours a completely mechanised and motorised army roared past the Führer." Afterwards Hitler asked, "I hope you were pleased with your children?" Fuller replied, "Your Excellency, they have grown up so quickly that I no longer recognise them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], 1939–45, Fuller was under suspicion for his Nazi sympathies. He continued to speak out in favour of a peaceful settlement with Germany.&lt;ref name ="McKinstry"/&gt;  [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]] (in his war diaries, p.&amp;nbsp;201) comments that "the Director of Security called on him to discuss Boney Fuller and his Nazi activities", though Alan Brooke commented that he did not think Fuller "had any unpatriotic intentions".  Although he was not interned or arrested, he was the only officer of his rank not invited to return to service during the war. There was some suspicion that he was not incarcerated in May 1940 along with other leading officials of the BUF because of his association with [[Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside|General Edmund Ironside]] and other senior officers. Mosley himself admitted to "a little puzzlement" as to why Fuller had not been imprisoned.&lt;ref name ="McKinstry"/&gt;

Fuller spent his last years a deeply embittered man feeling that the wrong side had won the Second World War, a thesis most fully announced in the 1961 edition of ''The Reformation of War'' where he announced his belief that Hitler was the savior of the West against the Soviet Union, and denounced Churchill and Roosevelt for being too stupid to see this. Fuller died in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], Cornwall in 1966.

==Military theories==
Fuller was a vigorous, expressive, and opinionated writer of [[military history]] and of controversial predictions of the future of war, publishing ''On Future Warfare'' in 1928. Seeing his teachings largely vindicated by the Second World War, he published ''Machine Warfare: An Enquiry into the Influence of Mechanics on the Art of War'' in 1942.

===''The Foundations of the Science of War (1926)''===
Fuller is perhaps best known today for his "Nine Principles of War"&lt;ref&gt;''The Foundations of the Science of War'' (1926 ed.); Chapter IX, Section 6&lt;/ref&gt; which have formed the foundation of much of modern military theory since the 1930s, and which were originally derived from a convergence of Fuller's mystical and military interests. The Nine Principles went through several iterations; Fuller stated that 
''...the system evolved from six principles in 1912, rose to eight in 1915, to, virtually, nineteen in 1923, and then descended to nine in 1925...''&lt;ref name=Foundations&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=J.F.C.|title=The Foundations of the Science of War|year=1926|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, notice how his analysis of General Ulysses S. Grant was presented in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. F. C. Fuller|title=The Generalship of Ulysses S. Grant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZbfasAL1qUC&amp;pg=PA13|year=1929|page=13ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Army modified Fuller's list and issued its first list of the principles of war in 1921, making it the basis of advanced training for officers into the 1990s, when it finally reconceptualized its training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Dougherty|title=The United States Military in Limited War: Case Studies in Success and Failure, 1945-1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKbQ8iVzmFUC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Nine Principles of War====
The '''Nine Principles''' involve the uses of Force (combat power). They have been expressed in various ways, but Fuller's 1925 arrangement is as follows:

# '''Direction:''' What is the overall aim? Which objectives must be met to achieve the aim?
# '''Concentration:''' Where will the commander focus the most effort?
# '''Distribution:''' Where and how will the commander position their force?
# '''Determination:''' The will to fight, the will to persevere, and the will to win must be maintained.
# '''Surprise (Demoralisation of Force):''' The commander's ability to veil their intentions while discovering those of their enemy. Properly executed ''Surprise'' unbalances the enemy - causing Demoralisation of Force.
# '''Endurance:''' The force's resistance to pressure. This is measured by the force's ability to anticipate complications and threats. This is enhanced by planning on how best to avoid, overcome, or negate them and then properly educating and training the force in these methods.
# '''Mobility:''' The commander's ability to maneuver their force while outmaneuvering the enemy's forces.
# '''Offensive Action (Disorganisation of Force):''' The ability to gain and maintain the initiative in combat. Properly executed ''Offensive Action'' disrupts the enemy - causing Disorganisation of Force.
# '''Security:''' The ability to protect the force from threats.

====Triads and Trichotomies====
Cabalistic influences on his theories can be evidenced by his use of the "[[Trichotomy (philosophy)|Law of Threes]]" throughout his work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Foundations of the Science of War'' (1926 ed.); Chapter IX, Section 6&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller didn't believe the Principles stood alone as is thought today,&lt;ref&gt;''Foundations of the Science of War'' (1926 ed.); Chapter IX, Section 6; Diagrams 17, 18 &amp; 19&lt;/ref&gt; but that they complemented and overlapped each other as part of a whole, forming the [[Economy of force|Law of Economy of Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Foundations of the Science of War (1926 ed.); ''...be reduced to three groups, namely, principles of control, resistance, and pressure, and finally to one law - the law of economy of force...''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organization of Force====
These Principles were further grouped into the categories of ''Control'' (command / co-operation), ''Pressure'' (attack / activity) and ''Resistance'' (protection / stability). The Principles of Control guides the dual Principles of Pressure and of Resistance, which in turn create the Principles of Control.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*'''Principles of Control (1, 4, &amp; 7):''' Direction, Determination, &amp; Mobility.
*'''Principles of Pressure (2, 5, &amp; 8):''' Concentration, Surprise, &amp; Offensive Action.
*'''Principles of Resistance (3, 6, &amp; 9):''' Distribution, Endurance, &amp; Security.

====The Unity of the Principles of War====
They were also grouped into Cosmic (''Spiritual''),  Mental (''Mind / Thought / Reason''), Moral (''Soul / Sensations / Emotions''), and Physical (''Body / Musculature / Action'') Spheres, in which two Principles (like the double-edged point of an arrowhead) combine to create or manifest a third, which in turn guides the first and second Principles (like the fletches on an arrow's tail). Each Sphere leads to the creation of the next until it returns to the beginning and repeats the circular cycle with reassessments of the ''Object'' and ''Objective'' to redefine the uses of ''Force''. The Cosmic Sphere is seen as outside the other three Spheres, like the Heavens are outside the Realm of Man. They influence it indirectly in ways that cannot be controlled by the commander, but they are a factor in the use of Force. Force resides in the center of the pattern, as all of these elements revolve around it.&lt;ref&gt;''Foundations of the Science of War'' (1926 ed.); Chapter IX, Section 6; Diagram 17.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Cosmic Sphere:''' Goal (''Object'') &amp; Desire (''Objective'') =  Method (''Economy of Force'')
**''Goal'' is the overall purpose or aim of the mission (what Goals must the mission complete or achieve?).
**''Desire'' concerns the priority of the achievement or acquisition of the Goal (how important and essential is the Goal to the overall mission effort?).  
**''Method'' is how the forces available will carry out the mission (How much of the mission's force will be assigned - or are available - to accomplish the Goal?).  
*'''Mental Sphere (1, 2, &amp; 3):''' Reason (''Direction'') &amp; Imagination (''Concentration'') = Will (''Distribution'')
*'''Moral Sphere (4, 5, &amp; 6):'''  Fear (''Determination'')  &amp; Morale (''Surprise'') = Courage (''Endurance'')
*'''Physical Sphere (7, 8, &amp; 9):''' Attack (''Offensive Action'') &amp; Protection (''Security'') = Movement (''Mobility'')

These [[Principles of War]] have been adopted and further refined by the military forces of several nations, most notably within NATO, and continue to be applied widely to modern strategic thinking. Recently they have also been applied to business tactics&lt;ref&gt;

===''Armament and History (1945)''===
Fuller also developed the idea of the ''Constant Tactical Factor''. This states that every improvement in warfare is checked by a counter-improvement, causing the advantage to shift back and forth between the offensive and the defensive. Fuller's firsthand experience in the First World War saw a shift from the defensive power of the machine gun to the offensive power of the tank.

==Magic and mysticism==
Fuller had an [[occultist]] side that oddly mixed with his military side.  He was an early disciple of English poet and magician [[Aleister Crowley]], and was very familiar with his and other forms of [[magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]] and [[Thelemic mysticism|mysticism]].  While serving in the [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry#Operations across the Empire (1881–1914)|First Oxfordshire Light Infantry]] he had entered and won a contest to write the best review of Crowley's poetic works, after which it turned out that he was the only entrant.  This essay was later published in book form in 1907 as ''The Star in the West''.  After this he became an enthusiastic supporter of Crowley, joining his magical order, the [[A∴A∴]]., within which he became a leading member, editing order documents and its journal, ''[[The Equinox]]''. During this period he wrote ''The Treasure House of Images'', edited early sections of Crowley's magical autobiography ''The Temple of Solomon the King'' and produced highly regarded paintings dealing with A∴A∴ teachings: these paintings have been used in recent years as the covers of the journal's revival, ''The Equinox, Volume IV''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

After the ''Jones vs. The Looking Glass'' case, in which a great deal was made of Aleister Crowley's [[bisexuality]] (although Crowley himself was not a party to the case), Fuller became worried that his association with Crowley might be a hindrance to his career. Crowley writes in chapter 67 of his book, ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'':

{{quote|
...to my breathless amazement he fired pointblank at my head a document in which he agreed to continue his co-operation on condition that I refrain from mentioning his name in public or private under penalty of paying him a hundred pounds for each such offence. I sat down and poured in a broadside at close quarters.

"My dear man," I said in effect, "do recover your sense of proportion, to say nothing of your sense of humour. Your contribution, indeed! I can do in two days what takes you six months, and my real reason for ever printing your work at all is my friendship for you. I wanted to give you a leg up the literary ladder. I have taken endless pain to teach you the first principles of writing. When I met you, you were not so much as a fifth-rate journalist, and now you can write quite good prose with no more than my blue pencil through two out of every three adjectives, and five out of every six commas. Another three years with me and I will make you a master, but please don't think that either I or the Work depend on you, any more than [[J.P. Morgan]] depends on his favourite clerk."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

After this, contact between the two men faded rapidly. The front pages of the 1913 issues of the ''Equinox'' (Volume 1, nos. 9 and 10), which gave general directions to A∴A∴ members, included a notice on the subject of Fuller, who was described as a "former Probationer";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.the-equinox.org/vol1/no9/eqi09000.html |title=Sun in Aries: Frontpages |work=The Equinox |publisher=Weiland &amp; Co |volume=1 |number=9 |publication-date=March 1913 |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notice disparaged Fuller's magical accomplishments and warned A∴A∴ members to accept no magical training from him. However, Fuller continued to be fascinated with [[occult]] subjects and in later years he would write about topics such as the [[Qabalah]] and [[yoga]].

Fuller was a prolific writer and published 45+ books.&lt;ref name=Trythall&gt;{{cite book|last=Trythall|first=A.J.|title="Boney" Fuller: The Intellectual General|year=1977|publisher=Cassell|location=London|isbn=0-933852-98-3|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Jadeja dynasty ruled the [[Cutch State|princely state of Kutch]] between 1540 and 1948, at which time India became a [[Independence of India|republic]].

Although the [[British Raj|British rulers]] found the tradition distasteful, the Jadeja's high social status and the rigid caste system that forbade intermarriage with lower social groups contributed to the community's tradition of [[female infanticide]] because it was difficult and costly to arrange suitable marriages for female offspring, with substantial dowries often being required. The practice continues to some degree today, although where modern facilities are available it may take the form of [[female foeticide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Female Infanticide, Property and the Colonial State |first=L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1473">'''Jai Swaminarayan''' (also spelled '''Jay Swaminarayan''') ([[Devnagari]]: जय स्वमिनाराय) is a notable religious term used in the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]] for both ritual and social purposes. It is used not only as a "hello" but also as a "goodbye". The idea being any thing you say or start, has to start with the God's name. People from this sect of Swaminarayan use it to start a phone conversation and end it. They use it to begin and end the congregation. People following other faiths use their own god's name for e.g. Jai Sri Krishna or Jai Ganesha. The literal meaning of the term is, "Hail [[Swaminarayan]]." Within the Swaminarayan Sampraday, the term is used as a greeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/articles/articledetails.asp?Articleid=7 Jay Swaminarayan] Swaminarayan Satsang&lt;/ref&gt;  Presently this term is used in daily [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] rituals worldwide at the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AHI7AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Jai+Swaminarayan A New Face of Hinduism: The Swaminarayan Religion, by Raymond Brady Williams] Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ymE9AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Jai+Swaminarayan&amp;dq=Jai+Swaminarayan&amp;pgis=1 Shastriji Maharaj, by Kishore Mahipatram Dave, Kiśora Mahipatarāma Dave] Bochasanvasi Shri Akshapurushottam Sanstha&lt;/ref&gt;

She has served as the Rabbi in Residence of [[Jewish Funds for Justice]] and as the Director of Outreach and Education for [[Jewish Council on Urban Affairs]].

Jacobs is also the author of a teshuvah (legal position), passed by the [[Rabbinical Assembly]]'s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards that says that Jews should pay their workers a living wage, create dignified workplaces, and hire union workers when possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/20052010/jacobs-living-wage.pdf?phpMyAdmin=G0Is7ZE%2CH7O%2Ct%2CZ1sDHpI8UAVD6 |title=Work, workers, and the Jewish owner |author=Rabbi Jill Jacobs |date=May 28, 2008 |publisher=The Rabbinical Assembly |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was named to ''Newsweek'''s list of the fifty most influential rabbis in 2009 and 2010;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The 50 Most Influential Rabbis in America |author= |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/06/28/the-50-most-influential-rabbis-in-america.html |newspaper=Newsweek |date=June 28, 2010 |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ''[[The Forward]]'' newspaper's list of fifty influential American Jews in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Forward 50, 2006 |url=http://www.forward.com/forward-50-2006/ |newspaper=The Forward |year=2006 |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2008,&lt;ref name="Forward 50 2008"&gt;{{cite news |title=Forward 50, 2008 |url=http://www.forward.com/forward-50-2008/ |newspaper=The Forward |year=2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jill Jacobs - Forward 50 |year=2011 |url=http://forward.com/specials/forward-50-2011/jill-jacobs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to ''[[The Jewish Week]]''{{'}}s list of "thirty-six under thirty-six" in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=36 Under 36: The Next Wave SOCIAL JUSTICE &amp; GLOBAL CHANGE |author= |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/36_under_36_next_wave_social_justice_global_change |newspaper=The Jewish Week |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615055413/http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/36_under_36_next_wave_social_justice_global_change |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also named to ''Newsweek''{{'}}s list of the 50 Most Influential Rabbis in America in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=50 Influential Rabbis |date=April 3, 2009 |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/04/03/50-influential-rabbis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The 50 Most Influential Rabbis in America |date=June 28, 2010 |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/06/28/the-50-most-influential-rabbis-in-america.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=America's 50 Most Influential Rabbis |date=April 16, 2011 |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/04/16/50-most-influential-rabbis-in-america.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=America’s Top 50 Rabbis for 2012 |year=2012 |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/galleries/2012/04/02/america-s-top-50-rabbis-for-2012.html#slide_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs was born in Boston and grew up in Framingham, Massachusetts, where she attended Framingham public schools. She was ordained by the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in 2003 and also earned an MA in Talmud at the same time. She earned an MS in Urban Affairs from [[Hunter College]], CUNY, in 2003, and a BA in Comparative Literature from [[Columbia University]] in 1997. She is married to Rabbi Guy Austrian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jill Jacobs, Guy Austrian  |author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/fashion/weddings/05Jacobs.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 5, 2007 |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Al tifrosh min hatzibur," (Don't distance yourself from the community) ''Avot 2:5'' |author=Rabbi Marcelo R.

In 2003, Jacobs, then a rabbinical student at the Jewish Theological Seminary, got into a public debate with Rabbi [[Daniel Gordis]]. She  wrote an article for the JTS student bulletin in which she critiqued Israel's policies toward Arab neighborhoods in [[East Jerusalem]]. The JTS administration censored the article, and David Freidenreich, the student editor of the bulletin, quit in protest. Jacobs and Freidenreich distributed around the school a copy of the censored article along with Freidenreich's letter of resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS; A Rift at Jewish Theological Over an Article About Israel |author=Tara Bahrampour |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/nyregion/neighborhood-report-morningside-heights-rift-jewish-theological-over-article.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 9, 2003 |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordis heard about the article and sent an e-mail excoriating Jacobs to his list of several thousand correspondents. Jacobs responded with a public plea for civil dialogue. Gordis sent a follow-up e-mail apologizing for any personal embarrassment he caused, without retracting any of his earlier comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=E-mail Spat Shines Light On Volatile Israel Debates After the Fire |author=Daniel Treiman |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/8484/ |newspaper=The Forward |date=March 28, 2003 |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lukeford.net/profiles/profiles/danny_gordis.htm |title=Danny Gordis |work=lukeford.net |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach to Judaism and social justice ==

Jacobs's approach to Judaism and social justice is driven by a belief that Jews should be involved in the public square as Jews. In ''There Shall be No Needy'' she writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When Jews engage in the public discourse as Jews, we should bring Jewish law and principles into the conversation in such a way as to enrich, rather than shut down, the discourse. We should also bring into this dialogue Jews and others who are engaged in public life; the conversation among rabbis, public policy experts, grassroots activists, and Jewish communal professionals should generate a nuanced understanding of how the Jewish community might approach individual issues.   
This approach precludes quoting a simplified version of Jewish law or text in order to prove a point, or asserting that Jewish law unequivocally demands a certain approach to an issue. Rather, Jewish sources should help us to see various sides of an issue, challenge our assumptions, and help us to formulate a response that takes multiple factors into account. The commitment to living our Judaism publicly should then push us to take public action on these principles, both as individuals and as a community. If we succeed in facilitating this rich conversation, she says, we will create a new kind of Jewish politics in America. Rather than trade sound bites, we will continue the talmudic tradition of dialogue, in which various questioners and commentary engage in an often messy conversation that eventually leads to a fuller understanding of the situation at hand. Jews who now exercise their commitments to public life outside of the Jewish community, she says,  will find a place within this community, as they contribute their own wisdom and observations to the conversation. She claims Individual Jews and Jewish institutions will strengthen their commitment to public life, as the question of how to address current issues becomes part of the general Jewish conversation, rather than something separate from it or as an add-on to discussion of Shabbat, kashrut, and other aspects of Jewish practice. We will witness the emergence of a Judaism that views ritual observance, study, and engagement in the world as an integrated whole, rather than as separate and distinct practices. The Jewish community’s deepened involvement in public life will change the face of religious politics in America, as other communities will recognize the Jewish community as an important and authentic religious voice in the public square of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=There Shall Be No Needy: Pursuing Social Justice Through Jewish Law &amp; Tradition |last=Jacobs |first=Jill  |year=2009 |publisher=Jewish Lights Publishing |location=Woodstock, Vermont |isbn=978-1-58023-394-1 |pages=220–221) |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Throughout her work, she integrates Jewish legal and narrative text, social science research, and stories of people she has met and with whom she has worked.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3556">'''Kenneth Owen Arvidson''' (1938 in MA (''Auckland'') – 2011), was a New Zealand poet and academic.

==Early life==
Arvidson was born in Hamilton and attended Catholic schools there and in Auckland. His secondary education took place at [[Sacred Heart College, Auckland|Sacred Heart College]].&lt;ref&gt;K O Arvidson, "Out of Irishtown", ''The Source of the Song: New Zealand Writers on Catholicism'', ed. [[Mark Williams (writer)|Mark Williams]], VUP, Wellington, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
As a student at [[University of Auckland|Auckland University]] he began publishing poems in ''Kiwi'' in the late 1950s while studying science. Arvidson transferred to an Arts course, studying German (as a preliminary for MSc) and attending lectures by [[Bill Pearson (New Zealand writer)|Bill Pearson]], [[John Reid (professor of English)|John Reid]], [[M. K. Joseph|M K Joseph]], [[Allen Curnow]] and others.&lt;ref name="Oxford1"&gt;"Arvidson, K.O.", Robinson and Wattie, ''The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature'', Oxford, Auckland 1998, pp. 27 and 28.&lt;/ref&gt; While studying for his MA in English, Arvidson taught senior English at [[St Peter's College, Auckland|St Peter's College]] from 1961 to 1963. Notably, he taught and considerably influenced the poet [[Sam Hunt (poet)|Sam Hunt]] in the [[Sixth form|lower sixth form]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="Oxford2"&gt;"Hunt, Sam", Robinson and Wattie, ''The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature'', pp. 249 and 250.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Locke]], another poet, also benefited from his teaching. He endowed a prize for poetry at St Peter's, which was awarded to Sam Hunt in that year.&lt;ref name="Magazines"&gt;''St Peter's College Magazines 1960-1963''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Arvidson lectured at [[Flinders University|Flinders University of South Australia]] from 1967 to 1970 and in 1971 moved to the [[University of the South Pacific]] to develop a degree programme in English and Commonwealth literature. He joined the staff of the [[University of Waikato]] in 1974 and later became a professor of English there.&lt;ref name="Oxford1"/&gt; Arvidson's research interests include [[John Henry Newman]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], [[Victorian literature]], [[Irish literature]], Pacific literature and [[Australian literature]].&lt;ref name="Oxford1"/&gt;

==Poet==
Arvidson's verse has appeared in literary magazines in New Zealand and internationally, and has been anthologised in Australia and Japan as well as the Penguin, Oxford and other New Zealand collections. Temporal and spiritual matters balance one another in much of his poetry, in keeping with his [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] cast of thought.&lt;ref name="Oxford1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/name-110562.html |title=K.

'''King Zhou''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|oʊ}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/zhou "Zhou"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{zh|t=紂王|p=Zhòu Wáng}}) was the pejorative [[posthumous name]] given to '''Di Xin''' ({{zh|c=帝辛|p=Dì Xīn}}), the last king of the [[Shang dynasty]] of ancient China.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 220.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also called '''Zhou Xin''' ({{lang|zh|紂辛}}; Zhòu Xīn). He may also be referred to by adding "Shang" (商 Shāng) in front of any of his names. In Chinese, his name Zhòu ([[wikt:纣|紂]]) also refers to a horse [[crupper]],&lt;ref&gt;{{unihan|7D02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the part of a saddle or harness that is most likely to be soiled by the horse. It is not to be confused with the name of the succeeding dynasty which has a different character and pronunciation.

==Early reign==
In the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', [[Sima Qian]] wrote that Di Xin, in the early part of his reign, had abilities which surpassed those of the ordinary man, and was quick-witted and quick-tempered. According to legend, he was intelligent enough to win all of his arguments, and he was strong enough to hunt wild beasts with his bare hands.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 220-221, referencing Sima Qian's Yin Benji chapter (史记 · 辛本纪).&lt;/ref&gt; He was the younger brother of [[Weizi of Song|Zi Qi]] (子启) and [[Weizhong of Song|Zi Yan]] (子衍) (later rulers of [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]]'s vassal state [[Song (state)|Song]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Lüshi Chunqiu]] (吕氏春秋·仲冬纪第十一)&lt;!--- 纣之同母三人，其长曰微子启，其次曰中衍，其次曰受德。受德乃纣也，甚 少矣。纣母之生微子启与中衍也，尚为妾，已而为妻而生纣。纣之父、纣之母欲置微子启以为太子、太史据法而争之曰：“有妻之子，而不可置妾之子。”纣故为后。用法若此，不若无法。---&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and father of [[Wu Geng]]. His father [[Di Yi]] had two brothers, [[Ji Zi]] and [[Bi Gan]]. Di Xin added to the territory of Shang by battling the tribes surrounding it, including the [[Dongyi]] to the east.

==Late reign==
In his later years, Di Xin gave himself over to drinking, women and abandoned morals, preferring these to the proper governance of the country, and ignored almost all affairs of state. According to Sima Qian, he even hosted festive orgies where many people engaged in immoral things at the same time with his concubines and created songs with crude (erotic) lyrics and poor rhythm. In legends, he is depicted as having come under the influence of his wicked wife [[Daji]], and committing all manner of evil and cruel deeds with her.  In fictionalizations, including the novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'', she was said to be possessed by a malevolent [[huli jing|fox spirit]].

One of the most famous forms of entertainment Zhou enjoyed was the "Alcohol Pool and Meat Forest" (酒池肉林).  A large pool, big enough for several canoes, was constructed on the Palace grounds, with inner linings of polished oval shaped stones from the seashores.  This allowed for the entire pool to be filled with alcohol.  A small island was constructed in the middle of the pool, where trees were planted, which had branches made of roasted meat skewers hanging over the pool.  This allowed Zhou and his friends and concubines to drift on canoes in the pool.  When they thirsted, they reached down into the pool with their hands and drank the wine.  When they hungered, they reached up with their hands to eat the roasted meat.  This was considered one of the most famous examples of decadence and corruption of a ruler in Chinese history.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In order to please Daji, he created the "Cannon Burning Punishment" (炮烙之刑).  One large hollow bronze cylinder was stuffed with burning charcoal and allowed to burn until red-hot, then prisoners were made to literally hug the cylinder, which resulted in a painful and unsightly death.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Zhou and Daji were known to get highly aroused after watching such torture.  Victims ranged from ordinary people and prisoners to high government officials, such as [[Mei Bo]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Qu Yuan]], ''Tian Wen'' (天问). "梅伯受醢".&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fund Zhou's heavy daily expenses, extremely heavy taxes were implemented.  The people suffered greatly, and lost all hope for the Shang dynasty.  Zhou's brother Wei Zi tried to persuade him to change, but was rebuked. His uncle Bi Gan similarly remonstrated with him, but Di Xin had his heart ripped out so he could see what the heart of a sage looked like. When his other uncle  Ji Zi heard this, he went to remonstrate with the kingly nephew and, feigning madness, was imprisoned.

==Fall==
When [[Zhou dynasty]]'s army, led by the famous [[Jiang Ziya]], defeated the Shang dynasty at the [[Battle of Muye]] in 1046 BC, Di Xin gathered all his treasures around himself in the Palace, and then set fire to his palace and committed suicide.

The name "Zhou" actually appeared after the death of King Zhou, a posthumous name (although perhaps used furtively by his contemporaries). This name was a representation of his actions, both dishonorable and cold-hearted. King Zhou would go down in history as one of the worst examples of a corrupted king in China.

==Mentions in literature and legend==
Zhou is mentioned in the [[Confucian Analects]] ('''19''' "子張");&lt;ref&gt;http://ctext.org/analects/zi-zhang#n1593&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the [[Three Character Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ctext.org/three-character-classic#n90610&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou is also one of the main subjects of ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'' and its various derivations in popular media. Thus, Di Xin, also known as Zhou, has served as a (negative) exemplar of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] principles (presented as the wicked ruler who justifies regime change according to the [[Mandate of Heaven]]), as well as becoming an icon of popular culture. This makes for a biographically interesting figure, but one challenging a clear distinction between history, legend, and philosophical point-making.

In ''Fengshen Yanyi'', Zhou visited the Goddess [[Nüwa]]'s temple and offended the Goddess with his lustful comments towards her beauty. In response, Nüwa decided that the Shang dynasty should end and sent her three subordinates to become three beautiful women (including Daji) to bewitch Zhou. Under the influence of these women, Zhou becomes a ruthless king, losing the support of people and triggering his downfall. Until now, nobody knows most of his lifestyle from the reduced amount of artifacts found regarding to him.

==God of marriage==
According to the ''[[Investiture of the Gods]]'', [[Jiang Ziya]] recognized that King Zhou was a well-versed and well-trained individual that became an incapable ruler only because of having fallen victim to seduction. After his death, Jiang Ziya deified King Zhou as the '''Tianxi Xing''' (天喜星 "Star of Heavenly Happiness"). As the Tianxi Xing, he had the responsibility of managing the marriage affairs of humans.

The Roman deities most familiar today are those the Romans identified with Greek counterparts (see ''[[interpretatio graeca]]''), integrating [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]], [[ancient Greek art|iconography]], and sometimes [[Religion in ancient Greece|religious practices]] into [[ancient Roman culture|Roman culture]], including [[Latin literature]], [[ancient Roman art|Roman art]], and [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious life]] as it was experienced throughout the [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. Many of the Romans' own gods remain obscure, known only by name and sometimes function, through inscriptions and texts that are often fragmentary. This is particularly true of those gods belonging to the archaic religion of the Romans dating back to the [[Roman Kingdom|era of kings]], the so-called "religion of [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]]", which was perpetuated or revived over the centuries. Some archaic deities have [[Italic peoples|Italic]] or [[Etruscan religion|Etruscan counterparts]], as identified both by ancient sources and by modern scholars. Throughout the Empire, the deities of peoples in the [[Roman province|provinces]] were given new theological interpretations in light of functions or attributes they shared with Roman deities.

An extensive alphabetical list follows a survey of theological groups as constructed by the Romans themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "Roman Gods," ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), pp. 75 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uf2_kHAs22sC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22The+following+is+a+summary+of+the+different+groupings+of+deities+in+Rome%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Cfz0TN3eGIf9nAePv4npCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20following%20is%20a%20summary%20of%20the%20different%20groupings%20of%20deities%20in%20Rome%22&amp;f=false online] and 77 (note 49).

&lt;ref name="archaeological museum naples 2016"&gt;Museo Archeologico Nazionale (Napoli). "[http://cir.campania.beniculturali.it/museoarcheologiconazionale/thematic-views/image-gallery/RA49?set_language=en  so-called Venus in a bikini]." ''Cir.campania.beniculturali.it''. Accessed 3 October 2016.
&lt;br&gt;"''The statuette portrays Aphrodite on the point of untying the laces of the sandal on her left foot, under which a small Eros [[Squatting position|squats]], touching the sole of her shoe with his right hand. The goddess is leaning with her left arm (the hand is missing) against a figure of Priapus standing, naked and bearded, positioned on a small cylindrical altar while, next to her left thigh, there is a tree trunk over which the garment of the goddess is folded. Aphrodite, almost completely naked, wears only a sort of costume, consisting of a corset held up by two pairs of straps and two short sleeves on the upper part of her arm, from which a long chain leads to her hips and forms a star-shaped motif at the level of her navel. The 'bikini', for which the statuette is famous, is obtained by the masterly use of the technique of gilding, also employed on her groin, in the pendant necklace and in the armilla on Aphrodite’s right wrist, as well as on Priapus’ phallus. Traces of the red paint are evident on the tree trunk, on the short curly hair gathered back in a bun and on the lips of the goddess, as well as on the heads of Priapus and the Eros. Aphrodite’s eyes are made of glass paste, while the presence of holes at the level of the ear-lobes suggest the existence of precious metal ear-rings which have since been lost. An interesting insight into the female ornaments of Roman times, the statuette, probably imported from the area of Alexandria, reproduces with a few modifications the statuary type of Aphrodite untying her sandal, known from copies in bronze and terracotta''."

===Groupings of twelve===

====Lectisternium of 217 BC====
A [[lectisternium]] is a banquet for the gods, at which they appear as images seated on couches, as if present and participating. In describing the lectisternium of the Twelve Great gods in 217 BC, the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] [[Roman historiography|historian]] [[Livy]] places the deities in gender-balanced pairs:&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 22.10.9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]-[[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]
*[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]-[[Minerva]]
*[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]-[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]
*[[Apollo]]-[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]
*[[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]-[[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]
*[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]-[[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]
Divine male-female complements such as these, as well as the [[anthropomorphic]] influence of Greek mythology, contributed to a tendency in Latin literature to represent the gods as "married" couples or (as in the case of Venus and Mars) lovers.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[File:Altar twelve gods Louvre Ma666.jpg|thumb|left|''Di Consentes'' on an altar]]

====''Dii Consentes''====
[[Varro]] uses the name ''[[Dii Consentes]]'' for twelve deities whose gilded images stood in the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]]. These were also placed in six male-female pairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De re rustica'' 1.1.4: "eos urbanos, quorum imagines ad forum auratae stant, sex mares et feminae totidem.''&lt;/ref&gt; Although individual names are not listed, they are assumed to be the deities of the lectisternium. A fragment from [[Ennius]], within whose lifetime the lectisternium occurred, lists the same twelve deities by name, though in a different order from that of Livy: ''Juno, Vesta, Minerva, Ceres, Diana, Venus, Mars, Mercurius, Jove, Neptunus, Vulcanus, Apollo.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ennius]], ''Annales'' frg. 62, in J. Vahlen, ''Ennianae Poesis Reliquiae'' (Leipzig, 1903, 2nd ed.). Ennius's list appears in poetic form, and the word order may be dictated by the metrical constraints of [[dactylic hexameter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dii Consentes'' are sometimes seen as the Roman equivalent of the Greek [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]]. The meaning of ''Consentes'' is subject to interpretation, but is usually taken to mean that they form a council or consensus of deities.

{{div col end}}

Elsewhere, Varro claims [[Sol Indiges]], who had a [[sacred grove]] at [[Lavinium]], as Sabine but at the same time equates him with [[Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 5.10; Paul Rehak, ''Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Of those listed, he writes, "several names have their roots in both languages, as trees that grow on a property line creep into both fields. Saturn, for instance, can be said to have another origin here, and so too Diana."&lt;ref&gt;''e quis nonnulla nomina in utraque lingua habent radices, ut arbores quae in confinio natae in utroque agro serpunt: potest enim Saturnus hic de alia causa esse dictus atque in Sabinis, et sic Diana.''&lt;/ref&gt; Varro makes various claims for Sabine origins throughout his works, some more plausible than others, and his list should not be taken at face value.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Clark, ''Divine Qualities: Cult and Community in Republican Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2007) pp. 37–38; [[Emma Dench]], ''Romulus' Asylum: Roman Identities from the Age of Alexander to the Age of Hadrian'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 317–318.&lt;/ref&gt; But the importance of the Sabines in the early cultural formation of Rome is evidenced, for instance, by the [[Rape of the Sabine Women|bride abduction of the Sabine women]] by [[Romulus]]'s men, and in the Sabine ethnicity of [[Numa Pompilius]], second [[king of Rome]], to whom are attributed many of Rome's religious and legal institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Varro, however, says that the altars to most of these gods were established at Rome by [[Titus Tatius|King Tatius]] as the result of a vow (''[[votum]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Tatius is said by Varro to have dedicated altars to "[[Ops]], [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]], [[Vejovis|Vediovis]] and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], to [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]], [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], [[Vulcan (god)|Vulcan]] and [[Summanus]], and likewise to [[Larunda]], [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], [[Quirinus]], [[Vertumnus|Vortumnus]], the [[Lares]], [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]] and [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collectives==
Even in [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#invocatio|invocations]], which generally required precise naming, the Romans sometimes spoke of gods as groups or collectives rather than naming them as individuals. Some groups, such as the [[Camenae]] and [[Parcae]], were thought of as a limited number of individual deities, even though the number of these might not be given consistently in all periods and all texts. The following groups, however, are numberless collectives.

===Spatial tripartition===
Varro grouped the gods broadly into three divisions of heaven, earth, and underworld:
* ''di superi'', the gods above or heavenly gods, whose altars were designated as ''altaria''.&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''Divine Antiquities,'' book 5, frg. 65; see also Livy 1.32.9; Paulus apud Festus, p. 27; [[Servius Danielis]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 5.54; Lactantius Placidus , note to Statius, Theb. 4.459–60.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''di terrestres'', "terrestrial gods," whose altars were designated as ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ara|arae]].''
* ''[[di inferi]]'', the gods below, that is, the gods of the underworld, infernal or [[chthonic]] gods, whose altars were ''foci'', [[fire pit]]s or specially constructed hearths.

More common is a dualistic contrast between ''superi'' and ''inferi''.

===''Di indigetes'' and ''novensiles''===
The ''[[di indigetes]]'' were thought by [[Georg Wissowa]] to be Rome's indigenous deities, in contrast to the [[Novensiles|''di novensides'' or ''novensiles'']], "newcomer gods". No ancient source, however, poses this dichotomy, which is not generally accepted among scholars of the 21st century. The meaning of the epithet ''indiges'' (singular) has no scholarly consensus, and ''noven'' may mean "nine" ''(novem)'' rather than "new".

==Titles and honorifics==
Certain honorifics and titles could be shared by different gods, divine personifications, demi-gods and ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#divus|divi]]'' (deified mortals).

===''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' and ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]''===
''Augustus'', "the elevated or august one" ([[grammatical gender|masculine]] form) is an honorific and title awarded to [[Octavian]] in recognition of his unique status, the extraordinary range of his powers, and the apparent divine approval of his [[principate]]. After his death and deification, the title was awarded to each of his successors. It also became a near ubiquitous title or honour for various minor local deities, including the ''[[Lares#Lares and their domains|Lares Augusti]]'' of local communities, and obscure provincial deities such as the [[Africa (Roman province)|North African]] ''Marazgu Augustus''. This extension of an Imperial honorific to major and minor deities of Rome and her provinces is considered a ground-level feature of [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].

''Augusta'', the feminine form, is an honorific and title associated with the development and dissemination of Imperial cult as applied to [[Roman Empress]]es, whether living, deceased or deified as ''divae''. The first Augusta was [[Livia]], wife of [[Octavian]], and the title is then shared by various state goddesses including [[Bona Dea]], [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Minerva]], and [[Ops]]; by many minor or local goddesses; and by the female personifications of Imperial virtues such as [[Pax (mythology)|Pax]] and [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]].

===''Bonus'' and ''Bona''===
The [[epithet]] ''Bonus'', "the Good," is used in Imperial ideology with abstract deities such as ''Bona Fortuna'' ("Good Fortune"), ''Bona Mens'' ("Good Thinking" or "Sound Mind"), and ''[[Spes|Bona Spes]]'' ("Valid Hope," perhaps to be translated as "Optimism"). During the Republic, the epithet may be most prominent with [[Bona Dea]], "the Good Goddess" whose rites were celebrated by women. [[Bonus Eventus]], "Good Outcome", was one of Varro's twelve agricultural deities, and later represented success in general.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik H.J. Brouwer, ''Bona Dea: The Sources and a Description of the Cult'' pp. 245–246.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isis - Vienna.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.5|Roman Isis in black and white marble, from the time of [[Apuleius]]]]

===''Caelestis''===
From the middle Imperial period, the title ''Caelestis'', "Heavenly" or "Celestial" is attached to several goddesses embodying aspects of a single, supreme Heavenly Goddess. The ''Dea Caelestis'' was identified with the [[Virgo (constellation)|constellation Virgo]] ("The Virgin"), who holds the [[Libra (constellation)|divine balance of justice]]. In the ''[[The Golden Ass|Metamorphoses]]'' of [[Apuleius]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Apuleius]], ''[[The Golden Ass|Metamorphoses]]'' 11.2.&lt;/ref&gt; the protagonist Lucius prays to the Hellenistic Egyptian goddess [[Isis]] as ''Regina Caeli'', "[[Queen of heaven (antiquity)|Queen of Heaven]]", who is said to manifest also as Ceres, "the original nurturing parent"; Heavenly Venus ''(Venus Caelestis)''; the "sister of [[Phoebus]]", that is, Diana or [[Artemis]] as she is [[Temple of Artemis|worshipped at Ephesus]]; or [[Proserpina]] as the triple goddess of the underworld. [[Juno (mythology)#Epithets|Juno Caelestis]] was the Romanised form of the Carthaginian [[Tanit]].&lt;ref&gt;Benko, Stephen, ''The virgin goddess: studies in the pagan and Christian roots of mariology,'' Brill, 2004, pp. 112–114: see also pp. 31, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grammatically, the form ''Caelestis'' can also be a masculine word, but the equivalent function for a male deity is usually expressed through [[syncretism|syncretization]] with [[Caelus]], as in ''Caelus Aeternus Iuppiter,'' "Jupiter the Eternal Sky."

===''Invictus''===
[[File:Römermuseum Osterburken (DerHexer) 2012-09-30 032.jpg|thumb|Dedication made to the ''Deus Invictus'' by a [[Roman legionary]] in [[Brigetio]], [[Pannonia]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 03, 11008"A soldier of the [[Legio I Adiutrix]] [dedicated this] to the Unconquered God" ''(Deo Invicto / Ulpius Sabinus / miles legio/nis primae / (A)diutricis)''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''''Invictus'' ("Unconquered, Invincible")''' was in use as a divine epithet by the early 3rd century BC. In the Imperial period, it expressed the invincibility of deities embraced officially, such as Jupiter, Mars, [[Hercules in ancient Rome|Hercules]], and [[Sol Invictus|Sol]]. On coins, calendars, and other inscriptions, Mercury, Saturn, [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]], [[Fontus|Fons]], [[Serapis]], [[Sabazius]], Apollo, and the Genius are also found as ''Invictus.'' Cicero considers it a normal epithet for Jupiter, in regard to whom it is probably a synonym for ''Omnipotens''. It is also used in the [[Mithraic mysteries]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Ernst Hijmans, ''Sol: The Sun in the Art and Religions of Rome'' (diss., University of Groningen 2009), p. 18, with citations from the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mater'' and ''Pater''===
''Mater'' ("Mother") was an honorific that respected a goddess's maternal authority and functions, and not necessarily "motherhood" per se. Early examples included [[Terra Mater]] (Mother Earth) and the [[Mother of the Lares|Mater Larum]] (Mother of the [[Lares]]). [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], a goddess of chastity usually conceived of as a virgin, was honored as ''Mater''. A goddess known as [[Stata Mater]] was a [[compitalia|compital]] deity credited with preventing fires in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the middle Imperial era, the reigning Empress becomes ''Mater castrorum et senatus et patriae'', the symbolic Mother of military camps, the [[Roman senate|senate]], and the fatherland. The Gallic and Germanic cavalry ''([[auxilia]])'' of the Roman Imperial army regularly set up altars to the "Mothers of the Field" (''Campestres'', from ''campus'', "field," with the title [[Matres and Matrones|''Matres'' or ''Matronae'']]).&lt;ref&gt;R.W. Davies, "The Training Grounds of the Roman Cavalry," ''Archaeological Journal'' 125 (1968), p. 73 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[List of Roman deities#Magna Mater|Magna Mater]] (Great Mother) following.

Gods were called ''Pater'' ("Father") to signify their preeminence and paternal care, and the [[pietas|filial respect]] owed to them. ''Pater'' was found as an epithet of [[Dis Pater|Dis]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Mars (mythology)#Mars Pater|Mars]], and [[Liber Pater|Liber]], among others.

====Magna Mater====
"The Great Mother" was a title given to [[Cybele]] in her Roman cult. Some Roman literary sources accord the same title to [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]] and other goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.12.16–33. Cited in H.H.J. Brouwer, ''Bona Dea: The Sources and a Description of the Cult'' (Brill, 1989), pp. 240, 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Indigitamenta''==
{{Main|Indigitamenta}}
The ''indigitamenta'' are deities known only or primarily as a name; they may be minor entities, or epithets of major gods. Lists of deities were kept by the [[College of Pontiffs]] to assure that the correct names were invoked for public prayers. The [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#libri pontificales|books of the Pontiffs]] are lost, known only through scattered passages in [[Latin literature]]. The most extensive lists are provided by the [[Church Fathers]] who sought systematically to debunk Roman religion while drawing on the theological works of Varro, also surviving only in quoted or referenced fragments. [[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher|W.H. Roscher]] collated the standard modern list of ''indigitamenta'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher|W.H. Roscher]], ''Ausführliches Lexikon der griechischen und römischen Mythologie'' (Leipzig: Teubner, 1890–94), vol. 2, pt. 1, pp. 187–233.&lt;/ref&gt; though other scholars may differ with him on some points.

'''''Mahomet''''' ({{lang-fr|Le fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophète}}, literally ''Fanaticism, or Mahomet the Prophet'') is a five-act [[tragedy]] written in 1736 by French [[playwright]] and [[philosopher]] [[Voltaire]]. It received its debut performance in [[Lille]] on 25 April [[1741 in literature|1741]].

The play is a study of [[religious fanaticism]] and self-serving [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] based on an episode in the traditional biography of [[Muhammad]] in which he orders the murder of his critics.&lt;ref name="Voltaire, 1964"&gt;Voltaire, ''Mahomet the Prophet or Fanaticism: A Tragedy in Five Acts'', trans. Robert L. Myers, ( New York: Frederick Ungar, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire described the play as "written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect".&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire ''Letter to Benedict XIV'' written in Paris on August 17, 1745 AD: "Your holiness will pardon the liberty taken by one of the lowest of the faithful, though a zealous admirer of virtue, of submitting to the head of the true religion this performance, written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect. To whom could I with more propriety inscribe a satire on the cruelty and errors of a false prophet, than to the vicar and representative of a God of truth and mercy? Your holiness will therefore give me leave to lay at your feet both the piece and the author of it, and humbly to request your protection of the one, and your benediction upon the other; in hopes of which, with the profoundest reverence, I kiss your sacred feet."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The story of ''Mahomet'' unfolds during Muhammad's post exile [[Occupation of Mecca|siege of Mecca]] in 629 AD, when the opposing forces are under a short term [[truce]] called to discuss the terms and course of the war.

In the first act the audience is introduced to a fictional leader of the [[Mecca]]ns, Zopir, an ardent and defiant advocate of [[free will]] and [[liberty]] who rejects Mahomet. Mahomet is presented through his conversations with his second in command Omar and with his opponent Zopir and with two of Zopir's long lost children (Seid and Palmira) whom, unbeknownst to Zopir, Mahomet had abducted and enslaved in their infancy, fifteen years earlier.

The now young and beautiful captive Palmira has become the object of Mahomet's desires and jealousy. Having observed a growing affection between Palmira and Seid, Mahomet devises a plan to steer Seid away from her heart by indoctrinating young Seid in religious fanaticism and sending him on a [[suicide attack]] to assassinate Zopir in Mecca, an event which he hopes will rid him of both Zopir and Seid and free Palmira's affections for his own conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Mahomet Act IV Scene I Mahomet speaking ''We must work in secret, the dark shades of death must hide our purpose—while we shed old Zopir's blood, be sure you keep Palmira in deepest ignorance; she must not know the secret of her birth: her bliss and mine depend upon it''&lt;/ref&gt; Mahomet invokes divine authority to justify his conduct.

Seid, still respectful of Zopir's nobility of character, hesitates at first about carrying out his assignment, but eventually his fanatical loyalty to Mahomet overtakes him&lt;ref&gt;Mahomet Act IV scene IV Seid declares, ''To serve my God, to please and merit thee, This sword, devoted to the cause of heaven, Is drawn, and shall destroy its deadliest foe,''&lt;/ref&gt; and he slays Zopir. Phanor arrives and reveals to Seid and Palmira to their disbelief that Zopir was their father. Omar arrives and deceptively orders Seid arrested for Zopir's murder, despite knowing that it was Mahomet who had ordered the assassination. Mahomet decides to cover up the whole event so as to not be seen as the deceitful impostor and tyrant that he is.

Having now uncovered Mahomet's vile deception, Palmira renounces Mahomet's god&lt;ref&gt;Mahomet Act V scene VI&lt;/ref&gt; and commits suicide rather than fall into the clutches of Mahomet.

==Analysis and inspiration==
The play is a direct assault on the moral character of [[Muhammad]].  [[Umar|Omar]] is a known historical figure who became second caliph; the characters of Seid and Palmira represent Muhammad's adopted son [[Zayd ibn Harithah]] and his wife [[Zaynab bint Jahsh]].

[[Pierre Milza]] posits that it may have been "the intolerance of the [[Catholic Church]] and its crimes done on behalf of the Christ" that were targeted by the philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;[Pierre Milza, Voltaire p.638, Librairie Académique Perrin, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire's own statement about it in a letter in 1742 was quite vague: "I tried to show in it into what horrible excesses fanaticism, led by an impostor, can plunge weak minds."&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, Lettres inédites de Voltaire, Didier, 1856, t.1, Lettre à M. [[César De Missy]], 1er septembre 1743, p.450&lt;/ref&gt; It is only in another letter dated from the same year that he explains that this plot is an implicit reference to [[Jacques Clément]], the monk who assassinated [[Henry III of France|Henri III]] in 1589.&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, ''Lettres inédites de Voltaire'', Didier, 1856, t.1, Lettre à M. [[César de Missy|César De Missy]], 1 septembre 1742, p.450&lt;/ref&gt; However, Milza considers that Islam wasn't the only focus of the plot and that the author's aim when writing the text was to condemn "the intolerance of the Church and the crimes that have been committed in the name of the [[Christ]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Milza]], ''Voltaire'' p.638, Librairie Académique Perrin, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Napoleon]], during his captivity on [[Saint Helena]], criticised Voltaire's ''Mahomet'', and said Voltaire had made him merely an impostor and a tyrant, without representing him as a "great man":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Mahomet'' was the subject of deep criticism. 'Voltaire', said the Emperor, 'in the character and conduct of his hero, has departed both from nature and history. He has degraded Mahomet, by making him descend to the lowest intrigues. He has represented a great man, who changed the face of the world, acting like a scoundrel, worthy of the gallows. He has no less absurdly travestied the character of [[Umar|Omar]], which he has drawn like that of a cut-throat in a melo-drama.'&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of the Life, Exile, and Conversations of the Emperor Napoleon'', volume 2, Emmanuel-Auguste-Dieudonné comte de Las Cases, Redfield, 1855, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5XUuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA94 p.94]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] holds up ''Mahomet'' as exemplary of Voltaire's dramatic genius and of the brilliance of classical French theatre as a whole.

In 2005, a production of the play in [[Saint-Genis-Pouilly]], [[Ain]], France, resulted in demands for cancellation and street disturbances outside the performance itself.&lt;ref name=ppg&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06065/666058.stm Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: "Muslims ask French to cancel 1741 play by Voltaire"], 06 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure to cancel the play, the Mayor allowed the play to continue despite "street disturbances" from Muslim groups. "Mayor Bertrand says he is proud his town took a stand by refusing to cave in under pressure to call off the reading. Free speech is modern Europe's 'foundation stone', he says. 'For a long time we have not confirmed our convictions, so lots of people think they can contest them.'"&lt;ref name=ppg/&gt;

'''Maris''' (or '''Mariś''') was an [[Etruscan civilisation|Etruscan]] god often depicted as an infant or child and given many [[epithets]], including ''Mariś Halna'', ''Mariś Husrnana'' ("Maris the Child"), and ''Mariś Isminthians''. He was the son of [[Hercle]], the Etruscan equivalent of [[Heracles]]. On two [[bronze mirror]]s, Maris appears in scenes depicting an immersion rite to ensure his immortality, possibly connected to stories about the [[centaur]] Mares, the ancestor of the [[Ausones]], who underwent a triple death and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''Varia Historia'' 9.16; [[Massimo Pallottino]], "Religion in Pre-Roman Italy," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some scholars think he influenced Roman conceptions of the god [[Mars (god)|Mars]],&lt;ref&gt;Pallotino, pp. 29, 30; [[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], "The Origin of the ''Ludi Saeculares''," in ''Studies in Roman Literature, Culture and Religion''  (Brill, 1956), p. 219 ''et passim''; [[John F.

'''Mark Gauvreau Judge''' (born September 24, 1964) is an American author and journalist known for books about his suburban [[Washington, D.C.]] youth, recovery from alcoholism, and the role of music in American popular culture. 

Judge briefly drew national attention during the 2018 [[Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh]], when professor [[Christine Blasey Ford]] alleged that Judge was present and laughing as [[Brett Kavanaugh|Kavanaugh]] sexually assaulted her when they were high school students over 30 years previously. &lt;ref name=wp /&gt; Judge said that he had no memory of the incident.&lt;Ref name=tatum /&gt;&lt;ref name=beech /&gt;

[[File:Seddon being sentenced to death.jpg|thumb|right|355px|In 1912, the poisoner [[Frederick Seddon]] (''left'') was sentenced to death by [[Thomas Townsend Bucknill|Mr Justice Bucknill]] wearing a [[black cap]] (''right'')]]
"'''May God have mercy upon your soul'''" or "'''may God have mercy on your soul'''" is a phrase used within courts in various legal systems by judges pronouncing a [[capital punishment|sentence of death]] upon a person found guilty of a crime that requires a death sentence. The phrase originated in [[beth din]] courts in the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] as a way to attribute [[God]] as the highest authority in law.&lt;ref name=et&gt;{{cite book | first = | last = | title =The Ethical Outlook, Volumes 46-47 | publisher =American Ethical Union| edition =   | year = 1960| isbn =  | page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of the phrase later spread to [[England and Wales]]' legal system and from there to usage throughout the colonies of the [[British Empire]] whenever a death sentence was passed.

Depending on where it is used, the phrase has had different emphasis through the years. It was formally intended as a prayer for the soul of the condemned.&lt;ref name=trial /&gt;&lt;ref name=tcr /&gt; However, in later times, particularly in the United States, it has only been said as a result of legal tradition where the religious meaning and origin is not founded on belief.&lt;ref name=norton /&gt;

== Wording ==
The phrase is used by the presiding judge pronouncing the sentence of death after putting on a [[black cap]] and black gloves.&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; In England, the black gloves were a deliberate contrast with the white gloves normally worn at the end of an [[Assizes|Assize]] sitting, which indicated there had been no death sentence passed during the Assize.&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; The wording of the traditional phrase has changed over time. In England, the wording in the 18th century was "and the Lord have mercy upon thy soul". This later developed into "may God have mercy upon your soul", which was used as the traditional closing sentence by judges passing the death sentence in England and Wales, [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; The phrase is treated as a prayer and would traditionally be followed by "[[amen]]".&lt;ref name=trial&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/TrialOfWilliamPalmer/TXT/0000%20-%200335.txt |title=Full text of "Trial Of William Palmer" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lhhi /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Arthur W.A. | last =Pollock  | title =The United Service Magazine |publisher=H. Colburn |volume=168 |year=1887 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcr&gt;{{cite book | title =[[The Christian Register]] |publisher=American Unitarian Association|volume=89 |year=1910 |issn=2158-1622 |page=1159}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Newspaper reports would cite the usage of the phrase as "the usual words had been said".&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book | first =Ken | last =Leyton-Brown  | title =The Practice of Execution in Canada | publisher =UBC Press| edition =   | year = 2010| isbn = 0774859326 | page = 161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the common wording of the phrase in England was "the law is that thou shalt return to the place whence thou camest and from thence to a place of execution where thou shalt hang by the neck 'til the body be dead. Dead. Dead. And the Lord have mercy upon thy soul".&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; This phrase later developed over time until the 1940s when the phrase in [[Dominion]]s of the British Empire was:&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; {{quote|The sentence of this court is that you will be taken from  here to the place from whence you came and there be kept in close confinement until [date of execution], and upon that day that you be taken to the place of execution and there hanged by the neck until you are dead. And may God have mercy upon your soul.}}

== History ==
The phrase is likely to have originated in the Kingdom of Israel following the [[Law of Moses]] in beth din courts as a way of giving credence to the authority of God as the author of all law.&lt;ref name=et /&gt;&lt;ref name=hinge /&gt; It is likely to have come from [[Deuteronomy]] 16:18 where it stated: "Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, tribe by tribe; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0516.htm#18 |title=Deuteronomy 16 / Hebrew&amp;ndash;English Bible |publisher=Mechon Mamre |date= |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise to the theory that judges had been given authority from God to exercise judgment on matters of the law and would use the phrase to attribute this fact to God.&lt;ref name=hinge /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = J.C. | title = A Justification of the Dissenters Against Mr. Bennet's, Charge of Damnable Schisme by a Divine of the Church of England.

Smith | year = 1705| isbn = | URL = https://books.google.com/books?id=teFbAAAAQAAJ | page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase continued to be used in courts, passing from [[Jewish]] to [[Christian]] context as a way to continue to affirm God as the highest authority in law.&lt;ref name=hinge&gt;{{cite book | first =John | last =Hunsuck  | title =Hinge Points of History | publisher =Certa Publishing | edition =   | year = 2014| isbn =193974878X | chapter = 2: Covenant to Covenant, Moses to Jesus|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clarence Darrow]], [[Oliver O'Donovan]] and the Chicago [[Law review|Law Journal]] have stated that the phrase's continual usage may have come about as a result of judges feeling that while they could pass a sentence of death upon a person, they personally did not have the authority to destroy souls and that only God had the authority to do that.&lt;ref name=darrow /&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvin 1816 195"&gt;{{cite book | first =Jean | last =Calvin | title =Institutes of the Christian Religion, Volume 3| publisher =Harvard University| edition =H.

During the 17th century in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], the [[Puritan]] majority of judges at the time did not believe that stating "may God have mercy on your soul" had any meaning unless the accused had made a confession of the crime in open court. They, and other Puritan office holders, would also regularly press the condemned up until the point of execution to make a confession of the crime they had been convicted of to ensure that the phrase satisfactorily had meaning according to their views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Bradley | last =Chapin  | title =Criminal Justice in Colonial America, 1606-1660 | publisher =University of Georgia Press | edition =reprint   | year = 2010| isbn =0820336912 | page = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, following independence from Great Britain, the phrase was not commonly used. However, when the first death sentence was passed in [[Taos County, New Mexico]], the judge used the phrase but immediately followed it with a statement that the court would not be responsible for asking "an all wise providence" to do something the jury could not do due to the American principle of [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Ann | last =Lacy  | title =Frontier Stories: A New Mexico Federal Writers' Project Book | publisher =Sunstone Press | edition =   | year = 2010| isbn =0865347336 | pages = 87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, due to American law moving away from moral judgments based on Christian principles towards the principle of a judgment that was "[[beyond reasonable doubt]]", the phrases "not having the fear of God before your eyes" and "may God have mercy upon your soul" were the very few remainders within the American court system of the [[British North America|British colonial]] morality-based trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Rogers | last =Alan  | title =Murder and the Death Penalty in Massachusetts | publisher =University of Massachusetts Press | edition =   | year = 2008| isbn =1558496335 | page = 78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, "may God have mercy on your soul" has been used as a closing statement in modern times by American judges when passing a sentence of death.

== In popular culture ==
The phrase has been used in a number of books and films. The phrase was used in the film ''[[Let Him Have It]]'' by the character of [[Lord Goddard]], however "may The Lord have mercy upon your soul" was used instead of the regular phrase.&lt;ref name=lhhi&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Peter Medak (director) | author-link = [[Peter Medak]] | date = 12 September 1991  | title = [[Let Him Have It]] | medium = Motion picture  | location = England, UK | publisher = British Screen Production}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also written in [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Victor |last=Hugo |url=http://www.online-literature.com/victor_hugo/hunchback_notre_dame/40/ |title=The Hunchback of Notre Dame by Victor Hugo: Chapter III.

The '''Merkezefendi Cemetery''' ({{lang-tr|Merkezefendi Mezarlığı}}) is a [[burial ground]] situated in Merkezefendi neighborhood of [[Zeytinburnu]] district on the European part of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]. The neighborhood and so the cemetery is named after [[Merkez Efendi]], an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[sufi]] (1463–1552).

Many renowned intellectuals, writers and artists rest in this old cemetery covering an area of {{convert|27800|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeytinburnu-bld.gov.tr/bel_zeytinburnu/ilce_gezisi/tarih/mezarliklar.cfm |publisher=Zeytinburnu Belediyesi |title=Zeytinburnu Mezarlıkları |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cemetery was established in the 16th century with the construction of the tomb of [[Merkez Efendi]] at this location. It was extended in the 1950s, and another cemetery, the Kozlu Cemetery was established {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} far from this place.

'''Monseigneur''' (plural: Messeigneurs or Monseigneurs) is an [[honorific]] in the [[French language]], abbreviated Mgr., Msgr.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|monseigneur|id=121733}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English use it is a [[title]] before the name of a French [[prelate]], a member of a [[royal family]] or other dignitary.  

'''[[Monsignor]]''' is both a title and an honorific  in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Monseigneur}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[francophone]] countries, it is rendered ''Monseigneur'', and this spelling is also commonly encountered in [[Canadian English]] practice.  

In France, monsignori are not usually addressed as ''monseigneur'', but by the more common term ''monsieur l'abbé'', as are priests. The plural form is ''Messeigneurs''.

==Addressing==
Prior to the overthrow of the French monarchy in 1792, '''Monseigneur''' equated to [[His Royal Highness]] or [[His Serene Highness]] when used as part of the title of a [[royal prince]],&lt;ref&gt;Harrap's Shorter French and English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; as in ''[[Louis XVIII|Monseigneur le comte de Provence]]''. King [[Louis XIV]] promoted the use of ''Monseigneur'' without the title as a style for the [[dauphin de France]] but this use lapsed in the 18th century. French [[Orléanist|royalists]] commonly style the current pretender ''Monseigneur''. In his book ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' [[Charles Dickens]] uses this honorific as a [[collective noun]] denoting the great [[nobility]] as a class.

This form of formal address is currently still in use at courts in Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco, and France. [[Royal prince]]s are formally addressed in the old French style. By tradition a Belgian or Luxembourgian prince is addressed as "Monseigneur" rather than "[[Your Royal Highness]]". The word "Monseigneur" is used when addressing a prince in any of Belgium's [[official language]]s, there being no Dutch or German equivalent. In France, it is also sometimes used when addressing [[pretender]]s to the French throne  [[Henri, Count of Paris (born 1933)|Henri d'Orléans, Count of Paris]] and [[Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou]], and when addressing [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Albert II]], [[head of state|Sovereign]] of Monaco (French style always is used in Monaco). The spouse of the prince is addressed as Madame.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has often held [[mortification of the flesh]] (literally, "putting the flesh to death"), as a worthy spiritual discipline. The practice is rooted in the Bible: in the asceticism of the Old and New Testament saints, and in its theology, such as the remark by Saint [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], in his [[Epistle to the Romans]], where he states: "If you live a life of nature, you are marked out for death; if you mortify the ways of nature through the power of the Spirit, you will have life." (Romans 8:13, [[Douay–Rheims Bible|DRC]]). It is intimately connected with Christ's complete sacrifice of himself on the Cross: "those who belong to Christ have crucified nature, with all its passions, all its impulses" (Gal 5:24, [[Douay–Rheims Bible|DRC]]). Christ himself enjoined his disciples to mortify themselves when he said: "If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me" (Matt 16:24, [[Douay–Rheims Bible|DRC]]). According to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], "[t]he way of perfection passes by way of the Cross. There is no holiness without renunciation and spiritual battle. Spiritual progress entails the ascesis and mortification that gradually lead to living in the peace and joy of the Beatitudes: ‘He who climbs never stops going from beginning to beginning, through beginnings that have no end. He never stops desiring what he already knows.’".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P71.HTM|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - Point 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of mortification is to train "the soul to virtuous and holy living" (The Catholic Encyclopedia, article on Mortification&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10578b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Mortification|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;). It achieves this through conforming ones passions to reason and faith. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, internal mortification, such as the struggle against pride and self-love, is essential, but external mortification, such as fasting can also be good if they conform with a spirit of internal mortification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10578b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Mortification|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mortification in Catholic history==
Throughout the Old Testament, persons fast and wear sackcloth to appease God. Furthermore, the [[nazirite]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s were persons who took special vows to, among other things, abstain from alcohol.

In the New Testament, Saint [[John the Baptist]] is the most clear example of a person practising corporal mortification. According to Mark 1:6, "John was clothed with a garment of camel’s hair, and had a leather girdle about his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey" ([[Douay–Rheims Bible|DRC]]).

The rule of St. [[Augustine of Hippo]] says: "Subdue your flesh by fasting from meat and drink, so far as your health permits. But if anyone is not able to fast, at least let him take no food out of meal time, unless he is sick."

[[St. Dominic Loricatus]] (995–1060) is said to have performed "One Hundred Years Penance" by chanting 20 psalters accompanied by 300,000 lashes over six days.
[[File:Franasis.JPG|right|thumb|200px|St. Francis: he asked pardon from his Brother Ass (the way he referred to his body), for his severe penances.]]
Later, [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]], who is said to have received the ''[[stigmata]]'', painful wounds like those of Jesus Christ, is said to have asked pardon to his body, whom he called Brother Ass,&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy
 | wstitle = St. Francis of Assisi
 | author = Paschal Robinson
}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the severe self-afflicted penances he has done: vigils, fasts, frequent flagellations and the use of a [[hairshirt]].

A [[Doctor of the Church]], St. [[Catherine of Siena]] (died 1380), was a tertiary Dominican who lived at home rather than in a convent, and who practiced austerities which a prioress would probably not have permitted. She is notable for fasting and subsisting for long periods of time on nothing but the [[Blessed Sacrament]]. St. Catherine of Siena wore sackcloth and scourged herself three times daily in imitation of St. Dominic.

In the sixteenth century, [[Thomas More|Saint Thomas More]], the Lord Chancellor of England, wore a [[hairshirt]], deliberately mortifying his body. He also used the '[[flagellation|discipline]].'

[[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius of Loyola]] while in [[Manresa]] in 1522 is known to have practiced severe mortifications. In the Litany prayers to Saint Ignatius he is praised as being “constant in the practice of corporal penance.” He was in the habit of wearing a cord tied below the knee.&lt;ref&gt;See his ''Autobiography'', first chapter, for mention of the cord tied below the knee.&lt;/ref&gt;

St. [[Teresa of Ávila]], a Doctor of the Church, undertook severe mortification once it was suggested by friends that her supernatural ecstasies were of diabolical origin. She continued until [[Francis Borgia]] reassured her. She believed she was goaded by angels and had a passion to conform her life to the sufferings of Jesus, with a motto associated with her: "Lord, either let me suffer or let me die."
[[File:Teresa of Avila dsc01644.jpg|170px|left|thumb|St. [[Teresa of Ávila]]: her motto was "Lord, either let me suffer or let me die."]]

St. [[Marguerite Marie Alacoque]] (22 July 1647 October-17 October 1690), the promoter of the devotion to the Sacred Heart, practised in secret severe corporal mortification after her First Communion at the age of nine, until becoming paralyzed, which confined her to bed for four years. Having been cured of her paralysis by the intercession of the Virgin Mary, she changed her name to Marie (French: Mary) and vowed to devote her life to the service of Mary.

St. [[Junípero Serra]] (November 24, 1713&amp;nbsp;– August 28, 1784) was a Franciscan friar who founded the mission chain in Alta California. A statue of Fr. Junipero Serra rests in Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol Building, representing the state of California. He was known for his love for mortification, self-denial and absolute trust in God.

A notable saint in the nineteenth century was St. [[Jean Vianney]] who converted hundreds of people in laicist France. [[Pope John XXIII]] said of him: "You cannot begin to speak of St. John Mary Vianney without automatically calling to mind the picture of a priest who was outstanding in a unique way in voluntary affliction of his body; his only motives were the love of God and the desire for the salvation of the souls of his neighbors, and this led him to abstain almost completely from food and from sleep, to carry out the harshest kinds of penances, and to deny himself with great strength of soul...[T]his way of life is particularly successful in bringing many men who have been drawn away by the allurement of error and vice back to the path of good living."{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

During the later part of the nineteenth century, [[Thérèse de Lisieux|Saint Thérèse of the Child Jesus]], another Doctor of the Church, at three years of age was described by her mother: "Even Thérèse is anxious to practice mortification.” Thérèse later wrote: "My God, I will not be a saint by halves. I am not afraid of suffering for Thee.” The "Little Flower", famous for her "little way" and love of God, fasted and used the "discipline" vigorously, "scourging herself with all the strength and speed of which she was capable, smiling at the crucifix through the tears which bedewed her eyelashes", according to one of her biographers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In the early twentieth century, the child seers of [[Our Lady of Fatima|Fatima]] said they had initially seen an angel, who said: "In every way you can offer sacrifice to God in [[Acts of Reparation|reparation]] for the sins by which He is offended, and in supplication for sinners. In this way you will bring peace to our country, for I am its guardian angel, the Angel of Portugal. Above all, ''bear and accept with patience the sufferings God will send you''." [[Lucia Santos]] later reported that the idea of making sacrifices was repeated several times by the Virgin Mary and that she had shown them a vision of [[hell]] which prompted them to ever more stringent self-mortifications to save souls. Among many other practices, Lucia wrote that she and her cousins wore tight cords around their waists, flogged themselves with stinging nettles, gave their lunches to beggars and abstained from drinking water on hot days. Lucia wrote that Mary said God was pleased with their sacrifices and bodily penances.

[[File:Ignatius Loyola.jpg|thumb|left|140px|St. Ignatius: he is praised in his litany for being "constant in the practice of corporal penance"]]

At the latter half of the twentieth century, [[Josemaría Escrivá|Saint Josemaría Escrivá]] practiced self-flagellation and used the [[cilice]], a modern-day version of the [[hairshirt]]. [[Pio of Pietrelcina|Saint Pio of Pietrelcina]], a saint who received the ''[[stigmata]]'' wrote in one of his letters: "Let us now consider what we must do to ensure that the [[Holy Spirit]] may dwell in our souls. It can all be summed up in mortification of the flesh with its vices and concupiscences, and in guarding against a selfish spirit... The mortification must be constant and steady, not intermittent, and it must last for one's whole life. Moreover, the perfect Christian must not be satisfied with a kind of mortification which merely appears to be severe. He must make sure that it hurts." Like St. Josemaria, Padre Pio and [[Mother Teresa of Calcutta]] used the [[cilice]] and [[discipline]] regularly as means of doing penance.&lt;ref&gt;"Spirituality of Mother Teresa of Calcutta and Its Transforming Influence on the Apostolate of the Missionaries of Charity for the Poorest of the Poor", p. 103, a doctoral thesis submitted at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas (the Angelicum) by A.C. Savarimuthu, 1999. The document cites "Mother's Instructions," Vol. 3, Supplement 2, pp. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some branches of Christianity have also institutionalized the practice of self-inflicted [[penance]] and corporal mortification through their mandate on fasting and abstinence for specific days of the year. Christian communities in some parts of the world still practice processions of public flagellation during [[Lent]] and [[Holy Week]].

==20th-century Catholic documents==
Recent theology affirms the practice of mortification. The [[catechism]] of the Catholic Church states: “The way of perfection passes by way of the Cross. There is no holiness without renunciation and spiritual battle. Spiritual progress entails the ascesis and mortification that gradually lead to living in the peace and joy of the [[Beatitudes]]” (n. 2015).

"Jesus' call to conversion and penance, like that of the prophets before him, does not aim first at outward works, "sackcloth and ashes," fasting and mortification, but at the conversion of the heart, interior conversion. Without this, such penances remain sterile and false; however, ''interior conversion urges expression in visible signs, gestures and works of penance.''" (''CCC'' 1430)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1430.htm ''CCC'' 1430]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John XXIII]], who convened the Second Vatican Council, taught in ''Paenitentiam Agere,''
an encyclical he wrote on July 1, 1962:

:But the faithful must also be encouraged to do outward acts of penance, both to keep their bodies under the strict control of reason and faith, and to make amends for their own and other people's sins... St. Augustine issued the same insistent warning: "It is not enough for a man to change his ways for the better and to give up the practice of evil, unless by painful penance, sorrowing humility, the sacrifice of a contrite heart and the giving of alms he makes amends to God for all that he has done wrong." ...But besides bearing in a Christian spirit the inescapable annoyances and sufferings of this life, the faithful ought also take the initiative in doing voluntary acts of penance and offering them to God.... Since, therefore, Christ has suffered in the flesh," it is only fitting that we be "armed with the same intent." It is right, too, to seek example and inspiration from the great saints of the Church. Pure as they were, they inflicted such mortifications upon themselves as to leave us almost aghast with admiration. And as we contemplate their saintly heroism, shall not we be moved by God's grace to impose on ourselves some voluntary sufferings and deprivations, we whose consciences are perhaps weighed down by so heavy a burden of guilt?

[[Pope Paul VI]] also stated:

:“The necessity of mortification of the flesh stands clearly revealed if we consider the fragility of our nature, in which, since Adam’s sin, flesh and spirit have contrasting desires. This exercise of bodily mortification—far removed from any form of stoicism—does not imply a condemnation of the flesh which the Son of God deigned to assume. On the contrary, mortification aims at the 'liberation' of man.”

==Pain, human nature, and Christ==
Theologians also state that the [[Jesus|Son]], the second person of the [[Trinity]], united himself, as a person (through the hypostatic union), to everything human (except sin), including pain.
[[File:Talbot.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Venerable [[Matt Talbot]] (May 2, 1856 June-7 June 1925) was an Irish worker whose life would have gone unnoticed were it not for the cords and chains discovered on his body when he died.]]
Catholics believe that God, who in their view by his divine nature cannot change, has united with changing human nature, and therefore with human pain. The "I" of the Second Person suffers and feels pain. He is one with pain through Jesus Christ. Thus Christ's experience of pain (like all the human acts of Christ like sleeping, crying, speaking) whose subject is the divine Person is an ''infinite act''. This is based on the classic dictum that the acts belong to the Person (''actiones sunt suppositorum''). It is the Person who acts: It is God who walks, God who talks, God who is killed, and God who is in pain. Thus a [[Christian]] who is united to Jesus Christ through pain is one with his infinite act of saving the world.

This also goes together with another dictum in theology: whatever is not united (to the Divine Person) is not saved. Thus, his intellect, his will, his feelings, are all united with the Person, and are all sanctified and redeemed, including pain. Pain is therefore a sanctified and redeeming human experience.

==The salvific meaning of suffering==

[[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]], who according to a recently released book on his sainthood cause practiced self-flagellation and fasting before important events, wrote an entire apostolic letter on the topic of suffering, specifically the salvific meaning of suffering: ''Salvifici Doloris''. It is considered a major contribution to the theology of pain and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_11021984_salvifici-doloris_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote this after suffering from a bullet wound due to the assassination attempt of [[Ali Agca]]. Six weeks after meeting his attacker, he wrote about suffering in Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

[[File:John Paul II Brazil 1997 3.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Pope John Paul II: "Suffering, more than anything else, makes present in the history of humanity the powers of the Redemption."]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Christ did not conceal from his listeners the need for suffering. He said very clearly: "If any man would come after me... let him take up his cross daily, and ''before his disciples he placed demands of a moral nature that can only be fulfilled on condition that they should "deny themselves"''. The way that leads to the Kingdom of heaven is "hard and narrow", and Christ contrasts it to the "wide and easy" way that "leads to destruction."

Christ does not explain in the abstract the reasons for suffering, but he states: "Follow me!". Come! ''Take part through your suffering in this work of saving the world, a salvation achieved through my suffering!'' Through my Cross.

Gradually, as the individual takes up his cross, spiritually uniting himself to the Cross of Christ, the salvific meaning of suffering is revealed before him. ...It is then that man finds in his suffering interior peace and even spiritual joy."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Joy in suffering==
Saint Paul speaks of joy in suffering in [[Colossians]]: "I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake". He had found a source of joy in overcoming the sense of the uselessness of suffering.

He states that it is suffering, more than anything else, which clears the way for the grace which transforms human souls. ''Suffering, more than anything else, makes present in the history of humanity the powers of the Redemption''.

St. [[Louis de Montfort]]'s prayer to the Virgin Mary includes, in his request to become more like Mary, the clauses "to suffer joyfully without human consolation; to die continually to myself without respite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Catholic Online |url=http://www.catholic.org/prayers/prayer.php?p=121 |title=St. Louis De Montfort's Prayer to Mary - Prayers - Catholic Online |publisher=Catholic.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis de Montfort was a strong advocate of finding joy and holiness in suffering. Those who have completed his 33-day Total Consecration to Jesus to Mary often wear a metal chain around their wrist or ankle. While this is not necessarily mortification, it represents a constant reminder of one's voluntary spiritual enslavement to Jesus through Mary, and the desire to accept suffering as a gift and offer it to God.

==The need for prudence==
The [[Desert Fathers]] emphasize that mortification is a means, not an end. They generally recommended [[prudence]] when practising mortification, with severe mortifications done only under the guidance of an experienced [[spiritual director]]. Consequently, practising mortification for physical pleasure is seen as a sin. Likewise, mortification for reasons of [[scrupulosity]] (which is similar to [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]) is considered very harmful: a contemporary example is fasting due to [[anorexia nervosa]]. Catholic moral theologians recommend that the scrupulous not practice mortification, avoid persons and materials of an ascetical nature, and receive frequent spiritual direction and psychological help.&lt;sup id="fn_1_back"&gt;[[#fn 1|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;
Not all forms of self-mortification are approved of by the Catholic Church. Practices such as the nonlethal [[crucifixion]]s performed on Good Friday in the [[Philippines]] are generally frowned upon by Catholic officials. Participants imitate various parts of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], including his crucifixion. The spectacle draws a large amount of tourism every year.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20071205192939/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37299&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50698">'''Muhammad's wives''', or the '''wives of Muhammad''', were the women married to the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]]. Muslims use the term prominently before or after referring to them as a sign of respect. The term "Mothers of the Believers" is applied to them which is derived from {{Cite quran|33|6|style=ref}}: "The Prophet is closer to the believers than their selves, and his wives are (as) their mothers."&lt;ref name="Aleem"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prophet Muhammad(s) and His Family|last=Aleem|first=Shamim|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4343-2357-6|page=85|chapter=12. Mothers of Believers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad was monogamous for 25 years. After his first wife [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid]] died, he proceeded to marry the wives listed below, and most of them were widows. Muhammad's life is traditionally delineated as two epochs: [[Muhammad in Mecca|pre-hijra]] (emigration) in [[Mecca]], a city in western [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], from the year 570 to 622, and [[Muhammad in Medina|post-hijra]] in [[Medina]], from 622 until his death in 632. All but two of his marriages were contracted after the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] (migration to Medina). Of Muhammad's thirteen wives, at least two, Rayhana bint Zayd and Maria al-Qibtiyya, were actually wives from his servants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Bennett|editor1-first=Clinton|title=In Search of Muhammad|date=1998|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780304704019|page=251|edition=reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fred James Hill|author2=Nicholas Awde|title=A History of the Islamic World|date=2003|publisher=Hippocrene Books|isbn=9780781810159|page=24|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there is debate among Muslims as to whether these two became his wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jerome A.

==History==
{{Muhammad}}
In Arabian culture, marriage was contracted in accordance with the larger needs of the tribe and was based on the need to form alliances within the tribe and with other tribes. Virginity at the time of marriage was emphasized as a tribal honor.&lt;ref&gt;Amira Sonbol, ''Rise of Islam: 6th to 9th century'', Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Montgomery Watt|Watt]] states that all of Muhammad's marriages had the political aspect of strengthening friendly relationships and were based on the Arabian custom.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), p.287&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Esposito|Esposito]] points out that some of Muhammad's marriages were aimed at providing a livelihood for widows.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (1998), pp. 16–8.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that remarriage was difficult for widows in a society that emphasized virgin marriages.&lt;ref&gt;John Esposito. ''[[Islam: The Straight Path]]''. Oxford University Press. p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Edward Peters]] says that it is hard to make generalizations about Muhammad's marriages: many of them were political, some compassionate, and some perhaps affairs of the heart.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters (2003), p.84&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad's first marriage lasted 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Francois-Cerrah|first1=Myriam|title=The truth about Muhammad and Aisha|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/sep/17/muhammad-aisha-truth|website=theguardian|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives of Muhammad marriages==
According to Islamic belief, the main objectives of Muhammad's marriages can be divided into four.&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;Anwar Al Awlaki, The Life of the Prophet Muhammad, the Makkan Period, CD 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="E. Phipps"&gt;{{cite book|last1=E. Phipps|first1=William|title=Muhammad and Jesus: A Comparison of the Prophets and Their Teachings|date=1 September 1999|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0826412072|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CbUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=reasons+of+Muhammad+marriages&amp;hl=fa&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjelaDW_IbYAhUCElAKHVLDD0AQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=reasons%20of%20Muhammad%20marriages&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Helping out the widows of his companions.
# Creating family bonds between him and his companions (Muhammad married the daughters of Abu Bakr and Umar, whereas Uthman and Ali married his daughters. He therefore had family bonds with all the first four Caliphs).
# Spreading the message by uniting different clans through marriage.
# Increasing credibility and sources for conveying his private family life. If he only had one wife, then it would have been a tremendous responsibility on her to convey Muhammad's private acts of worship and family life, and people would try to discredit her to destroy the credibility of these practices. However, with multiple wives, there were a lot more sources to the knowledge, making it more difficult to discredit. Therefore, his marriages gave more women the opportunity to learn and teach the matters of his private life.

Muhammad's first marriage was at the age of 25 to the 40-year-old Khadijah. He was married to one woman until the age of 50, after which he is believed to have had multiple wives for the four reasons explained above. With the exception of Aisha, Muhammad only married widows and divorced women or captives.&lt;ref name="E. Phipps"/&gt;

===Khadijah bint Khuwaylid===

At the age of 25, Muhammad wed his wealthy employer, the 40-year-old merchant [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid|Khadija]].

He declared the year as Aam ul Huzn (year of sorrow).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guillaume|title=The Life of Muhammad|publisher=Oxford|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hijra (migration) to Medina===
{{See also|Hijra (Islam)}}

====Sawda bint Zamʿa====
Before [[Hijra (Islam)|he left for Medina]], it was suggested by [[Khawlah bint Hakim]] that he marry [[Sawda bint Zamʿa]], who had suffered many hardships after she became a Muslim. Prior to that, Sawda was married to a paternal cousin of hers named As-Sakran bin ‘Amr, and had five or six sons from her previous marriage. There are disagreements in Muslim tradition whether Muhammad first married Sawda or [[Aisha]]. In one account, he married Sawda in [[Shawwal]], when Sawda was about 55 years old, in the tenth year of Prophethood, after the death of Khadija. At about the same period, Aisha was betrothed to him.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Watt,"Aisha bint Abu Bakr", ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' Online&lt;/ref&gt; As Sawda got older, and some time after Muhammad's marriage to [[Umm Salama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Gorgias Press LLC| isbn = 978-1-59333-398-0| last = Al-Shati| first = Bint| authorlink=Bint al-Shati| others = Matti Moosa (trans.), D.

====Aisha bint Abu Bakr====
{{main article|Aisha bint Abu Bakr}}
Aisha was the daughter of Muhammad's close friend [[Abu Bakr]]. She was initially betrothed to [[Jubayr ibn Mut'im]], a Muslim whose father, though [[Paganism|pagan]], was friendly to the Muslims. When [[Khawlah bint Hakim]] suggested that Muhammad marry Aisha after the death of Muhammad's first wife (Khadija), the previous agreement regarding marriage of Aisha with ibn Mut'im was put aside by common consent.&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt;

The majority of traditional sources state that Aisha was betrothed to Muhammad at the age of six or seven, but she stayed in her parents' home until the age of nine, or ten according to [[Ibn Hisham]],&lt;ref name=spellberg40&gt;{{harvnb|Spellberg|1994|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the marriage was [[consummation|consummated]] with Muhammad, then 53, in [[Medina]].&lt;ref name=armstrong157&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1992|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aisha_hadith"&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|58|234}}, {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes-usc|5|58|236}}, {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes-usc|7|62|64}}, {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes-usc|7|62|65}}, {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes-usc|7|62|88}}, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|8|3309}}, {{Hadith-usc|muslim|8|3310}}, {{Hadith-usc|muslim|8|3311}}, {{Hadith-usc|abudawud|41|4915}}, {{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|41|4917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{harvnb|al-Tabari|1987|p=7}}, {{harvnb|al-Tabari|1990|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; This timeline has been challenged by a number of scholars in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Mustadrak by Al-Hakim, v3, page 169 and page 371&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Aisha and Sawda, his two wives, were given apartments adjoined to the [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] [[mosque]].&lt;ref name=Nomani1&gt;Nomani (1970), pg. 257-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Per Sunni belief, Aisha was extremely scholarly and inquisitive. Her contribution to the spread of Muhammad's message was extraordinary, and she served the Muslim community for 44 years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = AuthorHouse| isbn = 9781434323576| last = Aleem| first = Shamim| title = Prophet Muhammad(s) and His Family: A Sociological Perspective| date = 2007|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also known for narrating 2210 hadith,&lt;ref&gt;Islamyat: a core text for students&lt;/ref&gt; not just on matters related to Muhammad's private life, but also on topics such as [[Islamic inheritance|inheritance]], [[Hajj|pilgrimage]], [[Islamic eschatology|eschatology]], among other subjects.&lt;ref name=Asma&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 9781107031586| last = Sayeed| first = Asma| title = Women and the Transmission of Religious Knowledge in Islam| date = 2013-08-06 | pages=27–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was highly regarded for her intellect and knowledge in various fields, including poetry and medicine, which received plenty of praise by early luminaries, such as the historian [[Al-Zuhri]] and her student [[Urwa ibn al-Zubayr]].&lt;ref name=Asma /&gt;

===Widows of the war with Mecca===

====Hafsa bint Umar and Zaynab bint Khuzayma====
During the [[Conquest of Mecca|Muslim war with Mecca]], many men were killed leaving behind widows and orphans. [[Hafsa bint Umar]], daughter of [[Umar]] (‘Umar bin Al-Khattab), was widowed at [[battle of Badr]] when her husband [[Khunais ibn Hudhaifa]] was killed in action. Muhammad married her in 3 A.H./625 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Nomani (1970), pg. 360&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zaynab bint Khuzayma]] was also widowed at the battle of Badr. She was the wife of 'Ubaydah b. al-Hārith,&lt;ref&gt;Watt(1956), pg.393&lt;/ref&gt; a faithful Muslim and from the tribe of al-Muttalib, for which Muhammad had special responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Watt(1956), pg.287&lt;/ref&gt; When her husband died, Muhammad aiming to provide for her, married her in 4 A.H. She was nicknamed Umm Al-Masakeen (roughly translates as the mother of the poor), because of her kindness and charity.&lt;ref&gt;Lings (1983), p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

Close to Aisha's age, the two younger wives Hafsa and Zaynab were welcomed into the household. Sawda, who was much older, extended her motherly benevolence to the younger women. Aisha and Hafsa had a lasting relationship. As for Zaynab, however, she became ill and died less than eight months after her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Lings (1983), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Zaynab&gt;Lings (1983), p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nomani (1970), pg. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hind bint Abi Umayya (Umm Salama)====
The death of Zaynab coincided with that of Abu Salamah, a devout Muslim, as a result of his wounds from the [[Battle of Uhud]].&lt;ref name =Zaynab/&gt; Abu Salamah's widow, [[Umm Salama Hind bint Abi Umayya]] also a devoted Muslim, had none but her young children. Her manless plight reportedly saddened the Muslims, and after her ''[[iddah]]'' some Muslims proposed marriage to her; but she declined. When Muhammad proposed her marriage, she was reluctant for three reasons: she claimed to suffer from jealousy and pointed out the prospect of an unsuccessful marriage, her old age, and her young family that needed support. But Muhammad replied that he would pray to God to free her from jealousy, that he too was of old age, and that her family was like his family.&lt;ref name=Prophet&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamid |first=AbdulWahid|title=Companions of the Prophet Vol. 1 |date=1998 |publisher=MELS|location=London|isbn=0948196130|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;''Umm Salamah''.

====Rayhana bint Zayd====
In 626, [[Rayhana|Rayhana bint Zayd]], was a [[Jewish]] woman enslaved along with others after the defeat of the [[Banu Qurayza]] tribe. Her relationship with Muhammed is disputed. The sources regarding her status differ as to whether she was a concubine or whether she eventually married him.&lt;ref name="Tabaqat"&gt;{{Cite book

===Internal dissension===
After Muhammad's final battle against his Meccan enemies, he diverted his attention to stopping the [[Banu Mustaliq]]'s raid on Medina. During this skirmish, Medinan dissidents, begrudging Muhammad's influence, attempted to attack him in the more sensitive areas of his life, including his marriage to [[Zaynab bint Jahsh]],&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), 330-1&lt;/ref&gt; and an incident in which Aisha left her camp to search for her lost necklace, and returned with a Companion of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Spellberg2"&gt;[[Denise A. Spellberg]], Aisha bint Abī Bakr, Encyclopedia of the Qur'an&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zaynab bint Jahsh====
[[Zaynab bint Jahsh]] was Muhammad's cousin, the daughter of one of his [[Umama bint Abdulmuttalib|father's sisters]].&lt;ref name="Watt2"&gt;Watt (1974), p.156-159&lt;/ref&gt; In Medina Muhammad arranged the widowed Zaynab's marriage to his adopted son Zayd ibn Harithah. [[Caesar E. Farah]] states that Muhammad was determined to establish the legitimacy and right to equal treatment of the adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar E. Farah, ''Islam: Beliefs and Observances'', p.69&lt;/ref&gt; Zaynab disapproved of the marriage, and her brothers rejected it, because according to [[Ibn Sa'd]], she was of aristocratic lineage and Zayd was a former slave.&lt;ref name="Freyer88"/&gt;&lt;ref name = W158&gt;Watt (1974), page 158.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Montgomery Watt|Watt]] states that it is not clear why Zaynab was unwilling to marry Zayd as Muhammad esteemed him highly. He postulates that Zaynab, being an ambitious woman, was already hoping to marry Muhammad; or that she might have wanted to marry someone of whom Muhammad disapproved for political reasons.&lt;ref name = "Watt157158"&gt;Watt (1974), page 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Maududi]], after the Qur'anic verse {{cite quran|33|36|style=nosup|expand=no}} was revealed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Maududi| first = S. Abul A'la| authorlink = Abul Ala Maududi| title = The Meaning of the Qur'an| volume=4| publisher = Islamic publications ltd.| year = 1967|url=http://www.tafheem.net/main.html| page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaynab acquiesced and married Zayd.

Zaynab's marriage was unharmonious.&lt;ref name="Freyer88"&gt;Freyer Stowasser (1996), p. 88, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to Watt, it is almost certain that she was working for marriage with Muhammad before the end of 626. "Zaynab had dressed in haste when she was told 'the Messenger of God is at the door.' She jumped up in haste and excited the admiration of the Messenger of God, so that he turned away murmuring something that could scarcely be understood. However, he did say overtly: 'Glory be to God the Almighty! Glory be to God, who causes the hearts to turn!'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fishbein| first=Michael| authorlink=Michael Fishbein (translator)| title=The History Al-Tabari: The Victory of Islam| publisher=State University of New York Press|date=February 1997| isbn=978-0-7914-3150-4 |pages= 2–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaynab told Zayd about this, and he offered to divorce her, but Muhammad told him to keep her.&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt; The story laid much stress on Zaynab's perceived beauty.&lt;ref name = Rod/&gt; Nomani considers this story to be a rumor.&lt;ref name =Nomani&gt;Nomani (1970). ''Sirat al-Nabi''.&lt;/ref&gt; Watt doubts the accuracy of this portion of the narrative, since it does not occur in the earliest source. He thinks that even if there is a basis of fact underlying the narrative, it would have been subject to exaggeration in the course of transmission as the later Muslims liked to maintain that there was no celibacy and monkery in Islam.&lt;ref name = W158/&gt; Rodinson disagrees with Watt arguing that the story is stressed in the traditional texts and that it would not have aroused any adverse comment or criticism.&lt;ref name="Rod"/&gt;

Muhammad, fearing public opinion, was initially reluctant to marry Zaynab. The marriage would seem incestuous to their contemporaries because she was the former wife of his adopted son, and adopted sons were considered the same as biological sons.&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt; According to Watt, this "conception of incest was bound up with old practices belonging to a lower, communalistic level of familial institutions where a child's paternity was not definitely known; and this lower level was in process being eliminated by Islam."&lt;ref name="Watt1"&gt;William Montgomery Watt (1974), p.233&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad's decision to marry Zaynab was an attempt to break the hold of pre-Islamic ideas over men's conduct in society.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The Qur'an,{{cite quran|33|37|style=nosup|expand=no}} however, indicated that this marriage was a duty imposed upon him by God. It implied that treating adopted sons as real sons was objectionable and that there should now be a complete break with the past.&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt; Thus Muhammad, confident that he was strong enough to face public opinion, proceeded to reject these taboos.&lt;ref&gt;Watt(1956), p.330-1&lt;/ref&gt; When Zaynab's waiting period was complete, Muhammad married her.&lt;ref&gt;''Watt,'' page 156.&lt;/ref&gt; An influential faction in Medina, called "[[Munafiqun|Hypocrites]]" in the Islamic tradition,&lt;ref name = FS89&gt;Freyer Stowasser (1996), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; did indeed criticize the marriage as incestuous.&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt; Attempting to divide the Muslim community, they spread rumors as part of a strategy of attacking Muhammad through his wives.&lt;ref name = FS89/&gt; According to Ibn Kathir, the relevant Qur'anic verses were a "divine rejection" of the Hypocrites' objections.&lt;ref name = FS89/&gt; According to Rodinson, doubters argued the verses were in exact conflict with social taboos and favored Muhammad too much. The delivery of these verses, thus, did not end the dissent.&lt;ref name = Rod&gt;Rodinson, page 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Necklace incident====
Aisha had accompanied Muhammad on his skirmish with the Banu Mustaliq. On the way back, Aisha lost her necklace which she had borrowed from her sister Asma Bint Abu Bakr (a treasured possession), and Muhammad required the army to stop so that it could be found. The necklace was found, but during the same journey, Aisha lost it again. This time, she quietly slipped out in search for it, but by the time she recovered it, the caravan had moved on. She was eventually taken home by Safw'an bin Mu'attal.&lt;ref name = Ifk&gt;Peterson (2007), page 169-71&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumors spread that something untoward had occurred although there were no witnesses to this.&lt;ref name="Spellberg"&gt;[[Denise Spellberg|D. A. Spellberg]], ''Politics, Gender, and the Islamic Past: the Legacy of A'isha bint Abi Bakr'', [[Columbia University Press]], 1994, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes arose, and the community was split into factions. Meanwhile, Aisha had been ill, and unaware of the stories. At first, Muhammad himself was unsure of what to believe, but eventually trusted Aisha's protestations of innocence.&lt;ref name = Ifk/&gt; Eventually, verses of surah Nur were revealed, establishing her innocence, and condemning the slanders and the libel. Although the episode was uneasy for both Muhammad and Aisha, in the end, it reinforced their mutual love and trust.&lt;ref&gt;Ramadan (2007), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

According to shia ([[Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i|Allameh Tabataba']]), revealing of Nur's verses belongs to Maria al-Qibtiyya, another wife of Muhammad. Also the accuracy of incident free from which wife of Muhammad, isn't confirmed by shia scholar ([[Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi]]), because the [[Ismah]] of Muhammad is violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Multiple authors|title=The opinions of Shia and Sunni on Ifk incident|url=https://www.mouood.org/component/k2/item/17797-%D9%86%D9%82%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%83-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%87-%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%8C-%D8%A2%D9%8A%D9%87-11%D8%8C-%D9%88-%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%8A-%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%87-%D9%88-%D8%B3%D9%86%D9%8A.html|website=mouood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Makarem Shirazi|first1=Naser |title=Al amsel (الامثل)|volume=11|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconciliation===

====Juwayriyya bint al-Harith====

One of the captives from the skirmish with the [[Banu Mustaliq]] was [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith]], who was the daughter of the tribe's chieftain. Her husband, Mustafa bin Safwan, had been killed in the battle. She initially fell among the booty of Muhammad's companion Thabit b. Qays b. Al-Shammas. Upon being enslaved, Juwayriyya went to Muhammad requesting that she - as the daughter of the lord of the Mustaliq - be released, however the Prophet refused. Meanwhile, her father approached Muhammad with [[ransom]] to secure her release, but Muhammed still refused to release her. Muhammad then offered to marry her, and she accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Rodinson, page 196.&lt;/ref&gt; When it became known that tribes persons of Mustaliq were [[Kinship|kinsmen]] of the prophet of Islam through marriage, the Muslims began releasing their captives.&lt;ref&gt;Lings (1983), pg. 241-2&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Muhammad's marriage resulted in the freedom of nearly one hundred families whom he had recently enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;Nomani, pg. 365-6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safiyya bint Huyeiy Ibn Akhtab====
[[Safiyya bint Huyayy]] was a noblewoman,&lt;ref name =shati_saf1&gt;Al-Shati', 1971, 171&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of [[Huyayy ibn Akhtab]], chief of the Jewish tribe [[Banu Nadir]], who was killed at the [[Battle of the Trench]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq, ''Sirat Rasul Allah''. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). ''The Life of Muhammad'', p. 464. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad ibn Jabir al-Baladhuri, ''Kitab Futuh al-Buldan''. Translated by Hitti, P. K. (1916). ''Origins of the Islamic State'' vol. 1 p. 41. New York: Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt; She had been married first to the poet [[Sallam ibn Mishkam]], who had divorced her,&lt;ref name = shati_saf1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Vacca, Safiyya bt. Huyayy b. Ak̲htab, Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt; and second to [[Kenana ibn al-Rabi]], a commander. In 628, at the [[Battle of Khaybar]],&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt; Banu Nadir was defeated, her husband was executed and she was taken as a prisoner. Muhammad freed her from her captor Dihya and proposed marriage, which Safiyya accepted.&lt;ref name =Rodinson254/&gt; According to Martin Lings, Muhammad had given Safiyyah the choice of returning to the defeated Banu Nadir, or becoming Muslim and marrying him, and Safiyyah opted for the latter choice.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, Muhammad: His Life Based On The Earliest Sources (George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1983), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a hadith, Muhammad's contemporaries believed that due to Safiyya's high status, it was only befitting that she be [[manumission|manumitted]] and married to Muhammad.&lt;ref name="aziz-sufiya"&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/008.sbt.html#001.008.367] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820120526/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/008.sbt.html|date=2011-08-20}} Volume 1, Book 8, Number 367: Narrated 'Abdul 'Aziz&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars believe that Muhammad married Safiyya as part of reconciliation with the Jewish tribe and as a gesture of goodwill.&lt;ref&gt;Nomani(1970) p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1964) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; John L. Esposito states that the marriage may have been political or to cement alliances.&lt;ref&gt;John L. Esposito, Islam: The Straight Path, pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mawsili, Musnad p. 168"&gt;Abu Ya'la al-Mawsili, Musnad, vol. 13, p. 168, Cited in Muhammad Fathi Mus'ad, The Wives of the Prophet Muhammad: Their Strives and Their Lives, p.172)&lt;/ref&gt; Haykal opines that Muhammad's manumission of and marriage to Safiyaa was partly in order to alleviate her tragedy and partly to preserve their dignity, and compares these actions to previous conquerors who married the daughters and wives of the kings whom they had defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Husayn Haykal, The Life of Muhammad (North American Trust Publications, 1976), p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; According to some, by marrying Safiyyah, Muhammad aimed at ending the enmity and hostility between Jews and Islam.&lt;ref name="Mawsili, Musnad p. 168"/&gt;

Muhammad convinced Safiyya to convert to Islam.&lt;ref name =Rodinson254&gt;Rodinson (1971), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Al-Bayhaqi, Safiyyah was initially angry at Muhammad as both her father and husband had been killed. Muhammad explained "Your father charged the Arabs against me and committed heinous acts." Eventually, Safiyyah got rid of her bitterness against Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Bayhaqi, Dala'il an-Nubuwwah, vol. 4, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; According to Abu Ya'la al-Mawsili, Safiyya came to appreciate the love and honor Muhammad gave her, and said, "''I have never seen a good-natured person as the Messenger of Allah''".&lt;ref&gt;Abu Ya'la al-Mawsili, Musnad, vol. 13, p. 38, Cited in Muhammad Fathi Mus'ad, The Wives of the Prophet Muhammad: Their Strives and Their Lives, p.172)&lt;/ref&gt; Safiyyah remained loyal to Muhammad until he died.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Husayn Haykal, The Life of Muhammad (North American Trust Publications, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Islamic tradition, Safiyya was beautiful, patient, intelligent, learned and gentle, and she respected Muhammad as "Allah's Messenger". Muslim scholars state she had many good moral qualities.&lt;ref name="islamonline.com"&gt;Safiyah Bint Huyeiy Ibn Akhtab, www.islamonline.com&lt;/ref&gt; She is described as a humble worshiper and a pious believer. [[Ibn Kathir]] said, "she was one of the best women in her worship, piousness, ascetism, devoutness, and charity".&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Kathir, Al-Bidayah wa an-Nihayah, vol. 8, p. 47, Cited in Muhammad Fathi Mus'ad, The Wives of the Prophet Muhammad: Their Strives and Their Lives, p.177&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ibn Sa'd, Safiyyah was very charitable and generous. She used to give out and spend whatever she had; she gave away a house that she had when she was still alive.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqat, vol. 8, p. 102, Cited in Muhammad Fathi Mus'ad, The Wives of the Prophet Muhammad: Their Strives and Their Lives, p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon entering Muhammad's household, Safiyya became friends with Aisha and Hafsa. Also, she offered gifts to Fatima. She gave some of  Muhammad's other wives gifts from her jewels that she brought with her from Khaybar.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqat, vol.8, p.100, Cited in Muhammad Fathi Mus'ad, The Wives of the Prophet Muhammad: Their Strives and Their Lives, p.172&lt;/ref&gt; However, some of Muhammad's other wives spoke ill of Safiyya's Jewish descent. Muhammad intervened, pointing out to everyone that Safiyya's "husband is Muhammad, father is [[Aaron#Aaron in Islam|Aaron]], and uncle is [[Moses in Islam|Moses]]", a reference to revered prophets.&lt;ref name = shati_saf2&gt;Al-Shati', 1971, 178-181&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad once went to [[hajj]] with all his wives. On the way Safiyya's camel knelt down, as it was the weakest in the caravan, and she started to weep. Muhammad came to her and wiped her tears with his dress and hands, but the more he asked her not to cry, the more she went on weeping.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, vol.6, p. 337, Cited in Muhammad Fathi Mus'ad, The Wives of the Prophet Muhammad: Their Strives and Their Lives, p.176&lt;/ref&gt; When Muhammad was terminally ill, Safiyya was profoundly upset. She said to him "I wish it was I who was suffering instead of you."&lt;ref name="islamonline.com"/&gt;

====Ramla bint Abi Sufyan (Umm Habiba)====

In the same year, Muhammad signed a [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah|peace treaty with his Meccan enemies]], the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] effectively ending the state of war between the two parties. He soon married the daughter of the Quraysh leader, [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]], aimed at further reconciling his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1961), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; He sent a proposal for marriage to [[Ramla bint Abi Sufyan]], who, was in Abyssinia at the time when he learned her husband had died. She had previously converted to Islam (in Mecca) against her father's will. After [[Second migration to Abyssinia|her migration to Abyssinia]] her husband had converted to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.com/news/newsfull.php?newid=933 Umm Habibah: Ramlah Bin Abi Sufyan]. IslamOnline. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927133302/http://www.islamonline.com/news/newsfull.php?newid=933 |date=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad dispatched ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damri with a letter to the [[Negus]] (king), asking him for Umm Habiba’s hand — that was in [[Muharram]], in the seventh year of Al-Hijra.

====Maria al-Qibtiyya====

[[Maria al-Qibtiyya]] was an [[Egypt]]ian [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christian]], sent as a gift to Muhammad from [[Muqawqis]], a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] official.&lt;ref&gt;A. Guillaume (1955), p. 653&lt;/ref&gt; and bore him a son [[Ibrahim ibn Muhammad]], who died in infancy.

====Maymuna bint al-Harith====

As part of the [[treaty of Hudaybiyah]], Muhammad visited Mecca for the lesser pilgrimage. There [[Maymuna bint al-Harith]] proposed marriage to him.&lt;ref name = shati_may1&gt;Al-Shati', 1971, 222-224&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad accepted, and thus married Maymuna, the sister-in-law of Abbas, a longtime ally of his. By marrying her, Muhammad also established kinship ties with the banu Makhzum, his previous opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Ramadan (2007), p. 1701&lt;/ref&gt; As the Meccans did not allow him to stay any longer, Muhammad left the city, taking Maymuna with him.

[[File:Location of grave of Fatema and others at J.Baqi,Medina.JPG|thumb|A map showing the grave of the wives of Muhammad and his daughters in [[Al-Baqi'|al-Baqīʿ Cemetery]]. Central rectangle just in front of Main Gate.]]
[[File:Grave Ajvaje(wife) nabi 1.JPG|thumb|Grave of the wives of Muhammad in [[Al-Baqi'|al-Baqīʿ Cemetery]], [[Medina]].]]

According to the Qur'an, God forbade anyone to marry the wives of Muhammad, because of their respect and honour, after he died.
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Nor is it right for you that ye should annoy Allah's Messenger, or that ye should marry his wives after him at any time.''{{Cite quran|33|53}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The extent of Muhammad's property at the time of his death is unclear. Although Qur'an [2.180] clearly addresses issues of inheritance, Abu Bakr, the new leader of the Muslim [[ummah]], refused to divide Muhammad's property among his widows and heirs, saying that he had heard Muhammad say:

:We (Prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity.&lt;ref name="OR"&gt;

Muhammad's widow Hafsa played a role in the collection of the first Qur'anic manuscript. After Abu Bakr had collected the copy, he gave it to Hafsa, who preserved it until Uthman took it, copied it and distributed it in Muslim lands.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Shati', 1971, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Muhammad's widows were active politically in the Islamic state after Muhammad's death. Safiyya, for example, aided the Caliph Uthman during his siege.&lt;ref name = shati_saf2/&gt; During the first fitna, some wives also took sides. Umm Salama, for example, sided with Ali, and sent her son Umar for help.&lt;ref name = shati_umm2&gt;Al-Shati', 1971, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The last of Muhammad's wives, Umm Salama lived to hear about the tragedy of [[Karbala]] in 680, dying the same year.&lt;ref name = shati_umm2/&gt;  The grave of the wives of Muhammed is located at [[Al-Baqi'|al-Baqīʿ Cemetery]], [[Medina]].

==Family life==
Muhammad and his family lived in small apartments adjacent the mosque at Medina. Each of these were six to seven spans wide (5.5&amp;nbsp;feet) and ten spans long (7.5&amp;nbsp;feet). The height of the ceiling was that of an average man standing. The blankets were used as curtains to screen the doors.&lt;ref&gt;Numani, p. 259-60&lt;/ref&gt; According to an account by Anas bin Malik, "The Prophet used to visit all his wives in a round, during the day and night and they were eleven in number."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|1|5|268}}: Narrated Qatada: Anas bin Malik said, "The Prophet used to visit all his wives in a round, during the day and night and they were eleven in number."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Muhammad's wives had a special status as ''Mothers of the Believers'', he did not allow them to use his status as a prophet to obtain special treatment in public.&lt;ref name = Mariya&gt;Ramadan (2007), p. 168-9&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5892">'''Od iyesi''' ([[Tatar language|Tatar]]: ''Ут Иясе'' or ''Ut İyäse''; [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]]: ''Вут Ийӗ''; [[Sakha language|Sakha]]: ''Уот Иччи'')  is the [[Turkic culture|Turkic]] and [[Mongol]]ian spirit or deity of fire. In Turkic languages, Od (or Ot) means fire, and iye is the familiar spirit of any natural asset, literally meaning "master" or "possessor." Od iyesi protects the fire. It is also known as '''Ateş iyesi''' or '''Alev iyesi''' ("flame" or "blaze spirit").

==Od Ana==

'''Od Ana''' is the Turkic and Mongolian goddess of fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotterell |first=Arthur |author2=Rachel Storm |title=The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Mythology |year=1999|publisher=Lorenz Books |location=New York |isbn=0-7548-0091-1 |pages=466, 481}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also referred to as goddess of marriage.

She was said to have been born at the beginning of the world, when the earth and sky separated and daughter of [[Yer Tanrı]]. 
 
Some equate her to [[Umai]], the mother goddess of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] Siberians, who is depicted as having sixty golden tresses that look like the rays of the sun. Umai is thought to have once been identical with Ot of the [[Mongol]]s.

[[Tengri]], the chief god, orders three fires to be burnt in the human soul, and Od Ana buries and puts out the three fires on Earth. Today, [[Turkish people]] call this "cemre," the fire that falls to Air, Earth and Water every year.

'''Religion in Hungary''' has been dominated by forms of [[Christianity]] for centuries. According to the 2011 census, 54.2% of the [[Hungarians]] declared to believe in [[Christianity]], of whom 38.9% were [[Catholic]]s (for the majority following the Roman rite, and a minority the Greek rite), 13.8% were [[Protestants]] (11.6% were [[Calvinists]] and 2.2% were [[Lutheran]]s), 0.1% were [[Orthodox Christians]], and 1.3% were members of other Christian groups.&lt;ref name="Census2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xftp/idoszaki/nepsz2011/nepsz_orsz_2011.pdf|title=2011 évi népszámlálás – Országos adatok|trans-title=2011 Year Census – National Data|publisher=Hungarian Central Statistical Office|page=23: A népesség vallás szerint (Population according to religion)}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, 27.2% of the Hungarians did not declare a religious affliation, 16.7% declared explicitly to be [[not religious]] and 1.5% [[atheism|atheists]]. Minority religions practised in [[Hungary]] include [[Buddhism]] (0.1% in 2011), [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]] (0.1% in 2011).&lt;ref name="Census2011"/&gt;

==Christianity==

{{Main|History of Christianity in Hungary|Catholic Church in Hungary|Reformed Church in Hungary}}
[[File:King St. Ladislaus.jpg|thumb|left|upright|King [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|Ladislaus I]] was an important figure in the [[History of Christianity in Hungary|country's Christianity]] during the Middle Ages.]]
The majority of Hungarians became Christian in the 11th century. Hungary's first [[King of Hungary|king]], [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen I]], took up [[Western Christianity]], although his mother [[Sarolt]] was baptized into [[Eastern Christianity]]. Hungary remained predominantly Catholic until the 16th century, when the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] took place and, as a result, first [[Lutheranism]] and then soon afterwards [[Calvinism]] became the religion of almost the entire population. Protestants composed some 85-90% of the entire population, more than a half of the Hungarian population being part of the calvinist confessing Reformed Church and a quarter of lutheran confessing Evangelical Church. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pállfy |first1=Géza |title=Searching for faith: a change of religion in Hungary |date=2007 |publisher=Akadémia Kiadó |location=Budapest |page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 16th century, however, the Catholic Habsburg Kings and [[Jesuits]] led a successful campaign of [[Counter-Reformation]] among the Hungarians. The Jesuits not only founded educational institutions, including [[Péter Pázmány Catholic University]], the oldest university that still exists in Hungary, but also organized so-called missions in order to promote popular piety. 

Using both political and apologetic efforts, most of the High Nobility composing the Diet was already predominantly Catholic by 1640's, a process consolidated as the new reconquered estates were granted to the converted aristocracy, who supported in Counter-Reformation. Despite this, the lower nobility, the town burghers and the common people still retained a largely protestant - specially calvinist - identity, opposing the catholic german-likeness of the Habsburg courtly politics. Allied with the Constitutional Rights enforced by the Nobility and the military pressure of the Protestant [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]] on the eastern border, Catholic Counter-Reformation achieved partial results compared to the other Habsburg-controlled possessions, like Bohemia and Austria, were Catholicism was restored to the status of the sole religion of the realm. 

Some of the eastern parts of the country, especially around [[Debrecen]] (nicknamed "the Calvinist Rome"), still have significant Protestant communities. The [[Reformed Church in Hungary]] is the second-largest church in Hungary with 1,153,442 adherents as of 2011.&lt;ref name=1920-2011/&gt; The church has 1,249 congregations, 27 presbyteries, and 1,550 ministers. The Reformed Church supports 129 educational institutions and has 4 theological seminaries, located in [[Debrecen]], [[Sárospatak]], [[Pápa]], and [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformatus.hu/mutat/6819/|title=Facts and Statistics: General information of the Reformed Church in Hungary in figures|work=Reformatus.hu|date=2012|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutheranism is the third main historical religion in Hungary. It was introduced by Saxon settlers in the early 16th century, but after its brief efflorescence, the introduction of the Reformed Church and the Counter-Reformation made it almost non-existent amongst Hungarians up to the late 17th century. Later it was re-introduced through inward migration by Saxons and Slovaks. Today, the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Hungary]] is a small minority in Hungary today. Despite its relatively small number of adherents, it had a strong power and influence in internal politics since Hungary's independence from the strongly Catholic Habsburg Empire.

The proportion of all Protestantism in Hungary has decreased from around 27% in the early 20th century to about 16% in the early 21st century.&lt;ref name=1920-2011/&gt; [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Hungary]] has been the religion mainly of certain national minorities in the country, notably [[Romanians]], [[Rusyns]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Serbs]]. Hungary has also been the home of a sizable [[Armenian Catholic]] community. They worship according to the [[Armenian Rite]], but they have united with the Catholic Church under the primacy of the Pope. Some of the Armenians in Hungary are adherents of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] was legally recognized in Hungary in June 1988 and its first meetinghouse in the country was dedicated in October of the following year by President [[Thomas S. Monson]]. In June 1990, the Hungary Budapest [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]] was created, followed by the first [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] in June 2006. The mission, its [[District (LDS Church)|districts]], and the Budapest Hungary Stake together contain twenty-two [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]] and [[Ward (LDS Church)|branches]] serving approximately 5000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/hungary|title=Facts and Statistics|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==

[[File:Synagogue Sopron Hungary.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The former [[synagogue]] of the Hungarian city of [[Sopron]].]]{{Main|History of the Jews in Hungary}}
Historically, Hungary was home to a significant [[Jewish community]], especially when many Jews, persecuted in Russia, found refuge in the Kingdom of Hungary during the 19th century. The census of January 1941 found that 4.3% of the population, or around 400,000 people, were considered religious Jews. In 2011, only 10,965 Jews (0.1% of the population) remained.&lt;ref name=1920-2011/&gt; Some [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jews]] were able to escape the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] during World War II, but most (perhaps 550,000)&lt;ref&gt;Braham, Randolph L. - Tibori Szabó Zoltán, A Magyarországi Holokauszt Földrajzi Enciklopediája [The Geographic Encyclopedia of the Holocaust in Hungary].

Most Jewish people who remain in Hungary live in the centre of Budapest, especially in district VII. The largest synagogue in Europe, the [[Dohány Street Synagogue]], is located in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatsynagogue.hu/gallery_syn.html |title=Budapest Dohany street Great Synagogue – the largest synagogue in Europe |publisher=Greatsynagogue.hu |accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==

[[File:Malkocs bég dzsámija.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Mosque in [[Siklós]].]]
{{Main|Islam in Hungary}}
The influence of [[Muslim]]s in Hungary was especially pronounced in the 16th century during the time of the [[Ottoman Hungary|Ottoman rule]]. According to the 2011 census, there were 5,579 Muslims in [[Hungary]], less than 0.1% of the total population.&lt;ref name=1920-2011/&gt; Of these, 4,097 declared themselves as [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] and 2,369 as [[Arab people|Arab]] by ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Census2011"/&gt;

==Buddhism==

{{Main|Buddhism in Hungary}}
In recent decades [[Buddhism]] has spread to [[Hungary]], primarily in its [[Vajrayana]] forms through the activity of [[Tibet]]an missionary [[bhikkhu|monks]]. Since in Hungary religions are encouraged to institutionalise into [[Place of worship|church]] (''egyház'') bodies in order to be recognised by the government, various institutions have formed, including the Hungarian Buddhist Church (''Magyarországi Buddhista Egyházközösség''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistaegyhaz.hu/|title=Magyarországi Buddhista Egyházközösség|trans-title=Hungarian Buddhist Church|language=hu|work=buddhistaegyhaz.hu|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Gate of Dharma Buddhist Church (''A Tan Kapuja Buddhista Egyház''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tkbe.hu/|title=A Tan Kapuja Buddhista Egyház|trans-title=Gate of Dharma Buddhist Church|language=hu|work=tkbe.hu|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, mostly Vajrayana. A [[Shaolin temple]], the [[Hungarian Shaolin Temple]], was founded in [[Budapest]] in 1994.

[[Dalit Buddhist movement|"Navayana" Buddhism]] or Ambedkarite Buddhism, a recent Buddhist denomination emerged among the [[Dalit]]s of [[India]], a form of Buddhism socially and politically engaged for the betterment of the conditions of marginalised peoples, has been spread also to the [[Roma in Hungary|Romani]] ethnic minority of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jura Nanuk|url=http://cerf-institute.org/2012/10/29/european-dalits-the-role-of-buddhism-in-social-integration-of-young-roma-in-hungary/|title=European Dalits: The role of Buddhism in social integration of young Roma in Hungary|work=Central-European Religious Freedom Institute|date=29 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031071028/http://cerf-institute.org/2012/10/29/european-dalits-the-role-of-buddhism-in-social-integration-of-young-roma-in-hungary/|archivedate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paganism==

{{Main|Neopaganism in Hungary}}
A rise of [[Neopagan]] (''Újpogányság'') movements has occurred in Hungary over the last decades.&lt;ref name="Koloszi"&gt;Ádám Koloszi. ''Social Constructions of the Native Faith: Mytho-historical Narratives and Identity-discourse in Hungarian Neo-paganism''. Central European University, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|author1=László-Attila Hubbes|author2=Rozália Klára Bakó|url=http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=336017068111080126078068069117095112028053007053033039065095087064115102122012096112048110119035050040030028112079100087070065007021047086002012098103065123019113024008082048006019064089070082065064110110069115074119095065064095070001080012068012126000&amp;EXT=pdf|title=Romanian and Hungarian Ethno-Pagan Organizations on the Net|publisher=Hungarian University of Transylvania|date=2011|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Hungarian paganism, based on [[Hungarian mythology]] and [[shamanism]] ([[Táltos]] tradition), has been revived and is known as ''[[Ősmagyar Vallás]]'' ("Ancient Hungarian Religion"). The Traditional Church of the Order of Arpad (''Árpád Rendjének Jogalapja Tradicionális Egyház''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arpadegyhaz.hu/index.php?type=webpage&amp;id=3|title=Árpád Rendjének Jogalapja Tradicionális Egyház|trans-title=Traditional Church of the Order of Arpad|language=hu|work=arpadegyhaz.hu|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ancient Hungarian Church (''Ősmagyar Egyház''), the Community of the Hungarian Religion (''Magyar Vallás Közössége''), the Ancient Hungarian Táltos Church (''Ősmagyar Táltos Egyház''), the ''Yotengrit'', and various Táltos groups are representative of this religion.&lt;ref name="Koloszi"/&gt;

Some Hungarians espouse [[Hungarian Turanism|Turanist]] ideas, and therefore other Táltos are affiliated with [[Tengrism]]. The Tengri Community (''Tengri Közösség'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tengri.hu/index.php/en/|title=Tengri Community|work=tengri.hu|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the Tengrist churches of Hungary. [[Wicca]], a religion of [[England|English]] origin, has spread to Hungary as in the other countries of [[Western Europe]]. [[Zsuzsanna Budapest]], a Hungarian who emigrated to the [[United States]], is the founder of the Wiccan denomination known as [[Dianic Wicca]], popular in North America. The Celtic Wiccan Tradition Church&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wicca.hu/|title=A Wicca Magyarországon|trans-title=The Wicca in Hungary|language=hu|work=wicca.hu|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Kelta-Wicca Hagyományőrzők Egyháza'') is a [[Celtic Wicca]]n church in Hungary.

The most recent statistics on '''religion in Rwanda''' were published by the US Government in 2013, yet the source information dates back to the national Census of 2002, which reports that: 56.9% of the Rwanda's population is [[Roman Catholicism in Rwanda|Roman Catholic]], 26
% is [[Protestant]], 11.1% is [[Seventh-day Adventist]], 4.6% is [[Islam in Rwanda|Muslim]] (mainly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]), 1.7% claims no or other religious affiliation, and 0.1% practices [[African traditional religion|traditional indigenous beliefs]].&lt;ref name=report&gt;International Religious Freedom Report, 2013: Rwanda, United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/222297.pdf. AND International Religious Freedom Report, 2011: Rwanda, United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/192958.pdf. Retrieved 2014-08-20. ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures for Protestants include the growing number of members of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (36,000 in 2013)  and [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Protestant groups.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; There is also a small population of [[Bahá'í Faith in Rwanda|Baha'is]]. There has been a proliferation of small, usually Christian-linked schismatic religious groups since the [[Rwandan genocide|1994 genocide]].&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

There are small and secretive communities of [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], comprising mostly foreign adherents, typically businessmen from [[China]] and [[India]] as well as university professors and students. Neither religion seriously attempts conversion in Rwanda or has places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g0FC40EQujwC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=Hinduism+in+Rwanda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F5X6rvmOEz&amp;sig=vSP8z3jl5WMQyFJCwvjxVURYMW0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidg8qcoNLWAhUO7mMKHSo1B_QQ6AEIaTAN#v=onepage&amp;q=Hinduism%20in%20Rwanda&amp;f=false|title=Culture and Customs of Rwanda|last=Adekunle|first=Julius|date=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780313331770|location=|pages=40|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current context==
Foreign [[missionaries]] and church-linked nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) of various religious groups operate in the country.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Foreign missionaries openly promote their religious beliefs, and the Government welcomes their development assistance.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The [[Constitution of Rwanda]] provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the Government generally respects this right in practice.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Local government officials sometimes detain Jehovah's Witnesses for refusing to participate in security patrols.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; In 2007, the US government received no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==History==

=== Colonial period ===
Although the ethnic divisions and tensions between [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] predate the colonial era, the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) report on the genocide states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the colonial era, under German and then Belgian rule, Roman Catholic missionaries, inspired by the overtly racist theories of 19th century Europe, concocted a destructive ideology of ethnic cleavage and racial ranking that attributed superior qualities to the country's Tutsi minority, since the missionaries ran the colonial-era schools, these pernicious values were systematically transmitted to several generations of Rwandans…&lt;ref name=OAU&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/OCHA-64DEEY?OpenDocument "Rwanda: The Preventable Genocide"], [[Organization of African Unity]], 7 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the Roman Catholic [[missionaries]] came to Rwanda in the late 1880s, they contributed to the "Hamitic" theory of race origins, which taught that the Tutsi were a superior race. The Church has been considered to have played a significant role in fomenting racial divisions between Hutu and Tutsi, in part because they found more willing converts among the majority Hutu.&lt;ref&gt;"''Dictionary of Genocide"'', Samuel Totten, Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven L. Jacobs, p. 380, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, {{ISBN|0-313-34644-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of religion in 1994 genocide===

An estimated 800,000 Rwandans died during ethnic violence over a brief span of 100 days between April and July 1994.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno1-3-04.htm#P95_39230&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the dead were Tutsis, and most of those who perpetrated the violence were Hutus.

The genocide started after the death of the [[President of Rwanda|Rwandan President]] [[Juvénal Habyarimana]], a Hutu, in the shooting down of his plane above [[Kigali International Airport|Kigali airport]] on 6 April 1994. The full details of that specific incident remain unclear; however, the death of the president was by no means the only cause of the mayhem. (Ethnic tension in Rwanda is not new. Disagreements between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis are common, but the animosity between them grew substantially after the end of the Belgian colonial regime.)

Timothy Longman has provided the most detailed discussion of the role of religion in the Rwandan genocide in ''Christianity and Genocide in Rwanda'', published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;
Timothy Longman, ''Christianity and Genocide in Rwanda'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Longman argues that both Catholic and Protestant churches helped to make the genocide possible by giving moral sanction to the killing. Churches had longed played ethnic politics themselves, favoring the Tutsi during the colonial period then switching allegiance to the Hutu after 1959, sending a message that ethnic discrimination was consistent with church teaching. The church leaders had close ties with the political leaders, and after the genocide began, the church leaders called on the population to support the new interim government, the very government supporting the genocide.

At the same time, churches did not uniformly support the genocide. In the period leading up to the genocide, 1990–1994, major splits emerged within most churches between moderates who promoted democratic change and conservatives allied with the Habyarimana regime. Many of the clergy were Tutsi, and they generally supported democratic reform, but many moderate Hutu within the churches supported reform as well. Churches provided major support to the formation of the new human-rights groups that emerged in the early 1990s. When the genocide began in 1994, some clergy and other church leaders opposed the violence,&lt;ref&gt;

Some individual members of the religious community attempted to protect civilians, sometimes at great risk to themselves.  For example, Mgr. {{ill|Thaddée Ntihinyurwa|fr}} of [[Cyangugu]] preached against the genocide from the pulpit and tried unsuccessfully to rescue three Tutsi religious brothers from an attack, while Sr. [[Felicitas Niyitegeka]] of the [[Auxiliaires de l’Apostolat]] in [[Gisenyi]] smuggled Tutsi across the border into [[Zaire]] before a militant militia executed her in retaliation.&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;

In her book ''Left to Tell: Discovering God in the Rwandan Holocaust'' (2006), [[Immaculée Ilibagiza]], a Tutsi woman, describes hiding with seven other Tutsi women for 91 days in a bathroom in the house of Pastor Murinzi - for the majority of the genocide. At the St Paul Pastoral Centre in Kigali about 2,000 people found refuge and most of them survived, due to the efforts of Fr Célestin Hakizimana. This priest "intervened at every attempt by the militia to abduct or murder" the refugees in his centre.  In the face of powerful opposition, he tried to hold off the killers with persuasion or bribes.&lt;ref name = "Kubai"&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:FischenthalKirche.JPG|thumb|A church in [[Fischenthal]], a village in the [[canton of Zürich]]]]
[[Christianity in Switzerland|Christianity]] is the predominant religion of [[Switzerland]], its presence going back to the [[Roman era Switzerland|Roman era]]. Since the 16th century, Switzerland has been traditionally divided into [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Swiss Reformation|Reformed]] confessions. 
However, adherence to Christian churches has declined considerably since the late 20th century, from close to 94% in 1980 to about 67% as of 2016. Furthermore notable is the significant difference in church adherence between Swiss citizens (72%) and foreign nationals (51%) in 2016.&lt;ref name=BfSreligion2016/&gt;

[[Switzerland as a federal state]] has no [[state religion]], though most of the [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] (except for [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]] and [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]]) recognize official churches (''[[Landeskirche]]n''), in all cases including the [[Roman Catholicism in Switzerland|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Swiss Reformed Church]]. These churches, and in some cantons also the [[Old Catholic Church]] and [[Jews|Jewish congregations]], are financed by official [[church tax|taxation of adherents]].&lt;ref name="CHKirchenSteuer"&gt;{{cite web |title=Die Kirchensteuern August 2013 |url=http://www.estv.admin.ch/dokumentation/00079/00080/00736/index.html?lang=de&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCDdYR6fGym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A-- |format=PDF |publisher=Schweizerische Steuerkonferenz SSK, Swiss Federal Tax Administration FTA, Federal Department of Finance FDF |location=Berne |year=2013 |language=German, French, Italian |accessdate=2014-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125112400/http://www.estv.admin.ch/dokumentation/00079/00080/00736/index.html?lang=de&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t%2Clnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCDdYR6fGym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A-- |archivedate=2012-01-25 |df= }}, [http://www.estv.admin.ch Swiss Federal Tax Administration]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Statistical Office (Switzerland)|Federal Statistical Office]] reported the religious demographics as of 2016 as follows (based on the resident population age 15 years and older):
66.9% Christian (including 36.5% Roman Catholic, 24.5% Reformed, 5.9% other),
24.9% unaffiliated,
5.2% Muslim, 
0.3% Jewish,
1.4% other religions.
(100%: 6,981,381, registered resident population age 15 years and older).&lt;ref name=BfSreligion2016/&gt;

==Demographics==
Until the 1970s, Protestants made up a majority of the Swiss population, decreasing to about a fourth nowadays. Some traditionally Protestant cantons and cities have today more Catholics than Protestants, due to a steady rise of the unaffiliated population in general combined with Catholic immigration from countries such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal, who mostly immigrated during the second half of the 20th century, and a less important immigration from Croatia during the last 25 years. 31% of all Catholics are foreign nationals versus 5% of Protestants. The unaffiliated form 25% of Switzerland's population in 2016,&lt;ref name=BfSreligion2016/&gt; and are especially strong in the canton of Basel-City, the canton of Neuchâtel, the canton of Geneva, the canton of Vaud, and Zürich. The country was historically about evenly balanced between Catholics and Protestants, with a complex patchwork of majorities over most of the country. One canton, Appenzell, was officially divided into Catholic and Protestant sections in 1597. The larger cities and their cantons (Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Zürich and Basel) used to be predominantly Protestant. [[Central Switzerland]], [[Valais]], [[Ticino]], [[Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhodes]], [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Canton of Basel-Land|Basel-Country]], [[Canton of St. Gallen|St Gallen]] and the half of [[Canton of Aargau|Aargau]] are traditionally Catholic. The [[Swiss Constitution]] of 1848, which came after the clashes between Catholic and Protestant cantons that culminated in the ''[[Sonderbundskrieg]]'', consciously defines a [[consociational state]], allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants. A 1980 initiative calling for the complete [[separation of church and state]] was rejected by 78.9% of the voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/va/19800302/index.html |title=Volksabstimmung vom 2. März 1980 |publisher=Schweizerische Bundeskanzlei |location=Berne, Switzerland |date=28 July 2015 |language=German, French, Italian |accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather recent [[immigration to Switzerland|immigration]] over the last 25 years has brought [[Islam]] (accounting for 5.2% in 2016&lt;ref name=BfSreligion2016/&gt;) and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] as sizeable minority religions.&lt;ref name=FSO&gt;{{Citation |last1=Bovay |first1=Claude |first2=Raphaël|last2= Broquet

Other Christian minority communities include Neo-[[Pietism]], [[Pentecostalism]] (mostly incorporated in the [[Schweizer Pfingstmission]]), [[Methodism]], the [[New Apostolic Church]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and the [[Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=FSO/&gt; Minor non-Christian minority groups are [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Judaism]] and other religions.&lt;ref name=FSO/&gt;

A survey conducted by [[Pew Research Center]] in 2017 found that 75% of Swiss adult population consider themselves Christians when asking about their current religion (irrespective of whether they are officially members of a particular Christian church by paying [[church tax]]). Nonetheless the same survey shows that only 27% of Christians in Switzerland attend church at least monthly, while the majority of Christians seldom go to church. 4% of people questioned state they have a non-Christian religion. 21% are of no religion, and nearly half of them consider themselves [[Atheism|Atheists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2018/05/29/being-christian-in-western-europe/ |title=Being Christian in Western Europe (survey among 24,599 adults (age 18+) across 15 countries in Western Europe) |publisher=Pew Research Center|date=29 May 2018  |accessdate=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many other European countries, the major Christian confessions are losing members whereas the numbers of unaffiliated and not religious people are growing fast and Muslims are slightly increasing and came to represent a more or less constant share of the population since 2000.

Inaugurated in July 2009, after four years of [[Minaret controversy in Switzerland|legal and political controversy]], this minaret, a Turkey-made plastic construction placed on the roof of the Turkish cultural center, was the initial motivation for the popular initiative voted upon later [[Swiss referendum, November 2009|in 2009]] which led to a nationwide ban of further minarets.]]

The [[Swiss constitution]] of 1848, written by the victorious pro-union Protestant cantons after the [[Sonderbundskrieg]] (Catholic-Separatist Civil War of 1847), consciously defines a [[consociational state]], allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants.
 
{{anchor|Jesuit question}} However, the Catholic [[Jesuits]] (''Societas Jesu'') were banned from all activities in either clerical or pedagogical functions by Article 51 of the [[Swiss constitution]] in 1848. The reason was the perceived threat resulting from Jesuit advocacy of [[traditionalist Catholicism]] to the stability of the state. In May 1973, 54.9% of Swiss voters approved removing the ban on the Jesuits (as well as Article 52 which banned monasteries and convents from Switzerland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/va/19730520/index.html |title=Volksabstimmung vom 20.05.1973 |date=20 May 1973 |language=German, French, Italian |publisher=Schweizerische Bundeskanzlei |accessdate=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement restrictions placed on [[History of the Jews in Switzerland|Swiss Jews]] in various instances between the 14th and 18th centuries were lifted with the revised [[Swiss Constitution]] of 1874.

A popular vote in March 1980 on the complete [[separation of church and state]] was clearly opposed to such a change, with only 21.1% voting in support, to the effect of the retention of the ''[[Landeskirche]]n'' system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/va/19730520/index.html |title=Volksabstimmung vom 02.03.1980|date=2 March 1980 |language=German, French, Italian |publisher=Schweizerische Bundeskanzlei |accessdate=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Swiss referendum, November 2009|November 2009]], 57.5% of Swiss voters approved of a [[popular initiative]] to ban the construction of [[minaret]]s in Switzerland. The four existing Swiss minarets, at mosques in [[Zürich]], [[Geneva]], [[Winterthur]] and [[Wangen bei Olten]] are not affected by the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/17/03/blank/key/2009/05.html |title=Abstimmungen – Indikatoren: Eidgenössische Volksabstimmung vom 29. November 2009 |language=German, French, Italian |publisher=Statistik Schweiz |date=29 November 2009 |accessdate=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of religion==
Full [[freedom of religion]] has been guaranteed since the revised [[Swiss Constitution]] of 1874 (Article 49). 
During the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], there had been no ''de facto'' freedom of religion, with persecution of [[Anabaptists]] in particular well into the 18th century. Swiss Jews had been given full political rights in 1866, although their right to settle freely was implemented as late as 1879 in the canton of [[Aargau]].
 
The current [[Swiss Constitution]] of 1999 makes explicit both positive and negative religious freedom in Article 15, paragraph 3--which asserts that every person has the right to adhere to a religious confession and to attend religious education—and paragraph 4, which asserts that nobody can be forced to either adhere to a religious confession or to attend religious education, thus explicitly asserting the right of [[apostasy]] from a previously held religious belief.

The basic right protected by the constitution is that of public confession of adherence to a religious community and the performance of religious cult activities. Article 36 of the constitution introduces a limitation of these rights if they conflict with public interest or if they encroach upon the basic rights of others. Thus, [[ritual slaughter]] is prohibited as conflicting with Swiss [[animal law]]s. 
Performance of cultic or missionary activities or religious processions on public ground may be limited. The Jesuit order was banned from all activity on Swiss soil from 1848 to 1973. The use of cantonal taxes to support cantonal churches has been ruled legal by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Federal Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://relevancy.bger.ch/php/clir/http/index.php?highlight_docid=atf%3A%2F%2F107-IA-126%3Ade&amp;lang=de&amp;type=show_document BGE 107 Ia 126, 130 (1981)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have argued that the [[Minaret controversy in Switzerland|minaret ban]] introduced by popular vote in 2009 constitutes a breach of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Zeit Online |url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2009-11/minarett-verbot-schweiz |title=Ein schwarzer Tag |author=Malte Lehming |date=30 November 2009 |location=Hamburg, Germany |accessdate=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Traces of the pre-Christian religions of the area that is now Switzerland include the [[European Bronze Age|Bronze Age]] "[[fire dog]]s". The [[Gaulish]] [[Helvetii]], who became part of [[Gallo-Roman]] culture under the [[Roman Empire]], left only scarce traces of their [[Gallo-Roman religion|religion]] like the statue of ''dea [[Artio]]'', a [[bear goddess]], found near [[Bern]]. A known Roman sanctuary to [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] was on a hill north-east of [[Baar, Switzerland|Baar]].&lt;ref&gt;''Baarburg'' at {{coord|47.205|N|8.555|E|}}; [[Tages-Anzeiger]] 5 June 2008 [http://tagi.ch/dyn/news/vermischtes/882184.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Peter, Zürich|St. Peter]] in [[Zürich]] was the location of a temple to [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]].

[[File:Sion Valere Castle 20070730.jpg|thumb|right|[[Basilique de Valère]] (12th century) in [[Sion, Switzerland|Sion]]]]

The [[Bishopric of Basel]] was established in AD 346; the bishopric of [[Bishop of Sion|Sion]], before 381; the bishopric of [[Geneva]]. in ''c''. 400: the bishopric of [[Vindonissa]] (now united as the [[Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg]]), in 517; and the [[Diocese of Chur]], before 451.

[[Germanic paganism]] briefly reached Switzerland with the immigration, from the 6th century, of the [[Alemanni]], who were gradually [[Germanic Christianity|converted to Christianity]] during the 6th and 7th centuries, with the establishment of the [[Bishopric of Constance]] in ''c''. 585. The [[Abbey of St. Gall]] rose as an important center of learning in the early Middle Ages.

The [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] was Roman Catholic as a matter of course until the [[Reformation in Switzerland|Reformation]] of the 1520s, which resulted in a lasting split of the Confederacy into Protestantism and Catholicism. This split lead to numerous violent outbreaks in [[Early Modern Switzerland|Early Modern times]] and included the partitioning of the former canton of Appenzell into the Protestant canton of [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]] and Catholic [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] in 1597. The secular [[Helvetic Republic]] was a brief intermezzo and tensions immediately resurfaced after 1815, leading to the formation of the modern confederal state in 1848, which recognizes ''[[Landeskirche]]n'' on a cantonal basis: the Roman Catholic and the Reformed Churches in each canton, and since the 1870s (following the controversies triggered by the [[First Vatican Council]]) the [[Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland|Christian Catholic Church]] in some cantons.

Geneva holds a special place in Protestant history as fundamental parts of [[John Calvin]]'s religious thought originated there, and was further progressed by [[Theodore Beza]], [[William Farel]] and other [[Reformed]] theologians. It also served as a haven for persecuted Protestants from France, including Calvin, who became the spiritual leader of the city, himself. [[Zürich]] is also important for Protestants, as [[Huldrych Zwingli]], [[Heinrich Bullinger]] and other Reformed theologians operated there.

The [[Jesuits]] (''Societas Jesu'') were the subject of a bitter controversy in 19th century Switzerland. 
The order had been dissolved in 1773 by [[Clement XIV]], but it was re-instated in 1814 by [[Pius VII]].

Over the following years, the Jesuits returned to the Swiss colleges they had owned prior to 1773, in Brig (1814), Sion (1814), Fribourg (1818) and Lucerne (1845), and especially Fribourg became a center of the [[Council of Trent]]. The Protestant cantons felt threatened by the re-appearance of the Jesuits and their program of [[traditionalist Catholicism]], which contributed to religious unrest and the formation of the [[Sonderbund]] of the Catholic cantons, and at the ''[[Tagsatzung]]'' of 1844 in vain demanded the expulsion of the Jesuit order from the territory of the Swiss confederacy.
The Protestant victory of the ''[[Sonderbundskrieg]]'' of 1847 led to the realization of such a ban in the 1848 [[Swiss Constitution]], expanded even further in the revised constitution of 1874, so that all activity of Jesuits either in clerical or in educational function was outlawed in Switzerland until 1973, when the paragraph was removed from the constitution by a popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{HDS|11718|Jesuits|author=Franz Xaver Bischof|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3645">'''Religion in the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]]''' (modern [[Argentina]]) saw great changes from the religious uses at the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], in the wake of the great social upheavals that took place during the [[Argentine War of Independence]]. Although the war was not a [[religious war]], and both patriots and royalists were equally [[Christian]], it was influenced by the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The relation with the [[Holy See]] through Spain was cut, until being restored by [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]].

==Colonial times==
During the colonial times, the local clergy was concerned because religious people [[Peninsulars|appointed from Spain]] were privileged over locals, regardless of their merits.&lt;ref&gt;Carbia, p. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; Religious people were more literate and illustrated than the average people in the viceroyalty, and had easier access to restricted books, such as those of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Those books were not limited to theological ones.&lt;ref&gt;Carbia, p. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; This illustration started during the reign of [[Charles III of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Carbia, p. 21-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Most prelates supported the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]]. Friar Ignacio Grela promoted at the cathedral the strengthening of the British influence, as well as the bishop [[Benito Lué y Riega]].&lt;ref&gt;Carbia, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, they stayed silent after the liberation of the city by [[Santiago de Liniers]].&lt;ref&gt;Carbia, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] was overthrown during the [[Peninsular War]], they supported the [[Retroversion of the sovereignty to the people]] principle.

==May Revolution==
{{see also|May Revolution|Primera Junta}}
Twenty-seven religious people attended the [[May Revolution#Tuesday, May 22|May 22 open cabildo]] to decide the fate of viceroy Cisneros. Benito Lue y Riega was a vocal opposer of his destitution, but seventeen of them voted for the end of his mandate and a military expedition to the other cities. At the end of it, the priest [[Manuel Alberti]] was appointed to the [[Primera Junta]].&lt;ref&gt;Carbia, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Lue y Riega accepted the authority of the junta, but the Junta did not trust him completely, and prevented him from taking a trip across the cities in order to watch him in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;Carbia, p. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; The distrust towards him extended to the supporters of the new government, generating incidents. As a result, he was prevented from making public appearances at his church.&lt;ref&gt;Carbia, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The regular clergy took advantage of the revolution and the cut off relations with Spain, and requested promotions and [[benefice]]s to the new government. People at lower ranks declared themselves [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriots]] suffering injustices, in order to get government protection.&lt;ref&gt;Carbia, p. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; The junta considered some cases, but eventually condemned the clergy that defied their religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Carbia, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a violent night incident against Antonio Palavecino forced the military to intervene, and the junta started to monitor more carefully the activities inside convents.

'''The Royal Aal al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought ''' is an international [[Islam]]ic non-governmental, independent institute in [[Amman]], Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aalalbayt.org/en/index.html The Royal Aal al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030052414/http://www.aalalbayt.org/en/index.html |date=October 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is affiliated with the [[Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre]].

The late King [[Hussein Bin Talal]] established the Institute in 1980, and entrusted it to Prince [[Prince Hassan bin Talal]]. It passed on to Crown Prince [[Prince Hamzah bin Al Hussein]] on August 8, 1999 and then to Prince [[Ghazi bin Muhammad]], who is the Chair of the Board of Trustees.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Fellows of the Institute attend a conference every 2–3 years. The last one was held in September 2010, under the title "Islam and the Environment".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petra.gov.jo/Public_News/Nws_NewsDetails.aspx?lang=2&amp;site_id=1&amp;NewsID=6088&amp;Type=P Jordan News Agency (Petra) |Aal al-Bayt Institute holds its 15th General Conference] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508223708/http://www.petra.gov.jo/Public_News/Nws_NewsDetails.aspx?lang=2&amp;site_id=1&amp;NewsID=6088&amp;Type=P |date=May 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was the leading sponsor of the statements, ''The [[Amman Message]]'' and ''[[A Common Word Between Us and You]]''.

'''''The 99''''' ({{lang-ar|الـ99}} or {{lang|ar|التسعة وتسعون}}) is a [[comic book]], created by [[Naif Al-Mutawa]] and published by [[Teshkeel Comics]], featuring a team of superheroes with special abilities based on the [[Names of God in the Qur'an|99 attributes of Allah]] in [[Islam]] but some are virtues encouraged by a number of faiths.

The character cast consists of Dr. Ramzi, a scholar and social activist, the 99 youngsters (some of them children), with special abilities conferred to them by "Noor" gemstones. The set of evil characters is led by the power-hungry Rughal, who seeks to steal the power of the Noor stones and their bearers for his personal benefit. The storyline pits the 99 led by Dr. Ramzi in their pursuit of social justice and peace against the forces of chaos and evil.

== Creation ==
The series was created by Naif Al-Mutawa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8127699.stm BBC NEWS | World | Middle East | 'Why I based superheroes on Islam'], ''[[BBC]]'', July 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; founder and C.E.O. of [[Teshkeel Media Group]]. The initial creative team for ''The 99'' was composed of comic book industry veterans such as [[Fabian Nicieza]], [[Stuart Moore]], [[June Brigman]], [[Dan Panosian]], [[John McCrea (comics)|John McCrea]], [[Ron Wagner]], [[Sean Parsons]] and [[Monica Kubina]].&lt;ref name="teshkeel.com"&gt;http://www.teshkeel.com   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520194031/http://www.teshkeel.com/ |date=May 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 99 was first launched in Kuwait in 2006 after it received approval from the country’s Ministry of Information, following which it was released globally. In September 2006, Unicorn Investment Bank acquired a stake in Teshkeel Media Group. Since the bank has a Sharia board, the investment enabled The 99 to gain approval in Saudi Arabia with its Sharia compliance.&lt;ref name="ind love"&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/the-all-islamic-super-heroes-muslim-children-love-the-99-comics-but-hardliners-loathe-their-creator-10101891.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenational.ae/the-latest-challenge-of-the-99-superheroes-is-tackling-a-fatwa-1.262154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
An ''Origins Preview'' was first published in the Middle East in May 2006, followed by a US reprinting in July [[2007 in comics|2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=title|id=14628|title=''Origins Preview''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The 99'' #1 was printed in September 2006 in the Middle East and was published in the US in August 2007 as ''First Light''.&lt;ref&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=title|id=15334|title=''First Light''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The 99'' only ran five issues in printed form, but both Middle East and USA editions continued to be published electronically until September 2013, with the final issue being #35. Indonesian and Indian editions were also produced.

== Premise ==

=== The Noor gemstones ===
During [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|the siege of Baghdad in 1258]], books from the [[House of Wisdom]] were tossed into the [[Tigris]] river by the [[Ilkhanate]] [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] forces and allied troops to use them as a bridge. Downstream, scholars dipped 99 gemstones into the water to absorb the wisdom and power from the books.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiYU3DZCepQ#t=0m59s THE 99 Animation Preview (Eng.)]", The99 YouTube channel, 2 December 2009. Retrieved 4 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characters ===
[[File:Iart695 DR RAMZI The 99.jpg|thumb|Doctor Ramzi Razem]]
The 99 are ordinary teenagers and adults from across the globe, who come into possession of one of the ninety-nine magical mystical Noor Stones (Ahjar Al Noor, Stones of Light) and find themselves empowered in a specific manner. All dilemmas faced by The 99 are overcome through the combined powers and capabilities of three or more members. Through this, The 99 series aims to promote values such as cooperation and unity throughout the Islamic world. Although the series is not religious, it aims to communicate Islamic virtues which are, as viewed by series creator Dr. Al-Mutawa, universal in nature.

The concept of The 99 is based on the [[Names of God in the Qur'an|99 attributes of Allah]]. Many of these names refer to characteristics that can be possessed by human individuals. For example, – generosity, strength, faithfulness, wisdom are all virtues encouraged by a number of faiths.

In compliance with Islamic tradition, the Arabic version of the aliases of each of the 99 is written without the definite [[Article (grammar)|article]] "Al-", because use of this precise form is [[Names of God in the Qur'an#Personal names|exclusive to Allah]]. This serves to remind that The 99 are only mortals, and sets them as human role models, with their qualities and weaknesses.

One of the characters, Batina The Hidden, wears a [[burqa]], which some reports highlighted.

== Critical reception and reviews ==
'''General'''

''The 99'' was listed by ''[[Forbes]]'' as one of the ‘Top 20 Trends Sweeping the Globe’&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/2008/01/09/internet-culture-global-forbeslife-globalpop08-cx_ee_0109pop_slide.html&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2008. In April 2010, in response to his speech in Cairo titled "[[A New Beginning]]", former US President [[Barack Obama]] mentioned Dr. Naif Al-Mutawa at the [[Presidential Summit on Entrepreneurship]] in Washington, referring to ''The 99'' as “perhaps the most innovative response,” and that “his comic books have captured the imagination of so many young people with superheroes who embody the teachings and tolerance of Islam”.&lt;ref&gt;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-presidential-summit-entrepreneurship&lt;/ref&gt;
''The 99'' has been covered by international media outlets including ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/22/world/middleeast/comics-to-battle-for-truth-justice-and-the-islamic-way.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2013/06/11/showbiz/comic-book-heroes-the-99-write/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newsweek.com/muslim-superheroes-rescue-95595&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC]],&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8127699.stm&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/07/AR2006020702034.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Controversies'''

In a religious decree carried by Saudi websites, the clerics ruled the series blasphemous because the superheroes of its title are based on the 99 attributes ascribed to Allah in the Quran. The Grand Mufti Abdulaziz al-Sheikh, head of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Issuing Fatwas, said "The 99 is a work of the devil that should be condemned and forbidden in respect to Allah's names and attributes." The original comic strip version, first released in 2006, had already run into opposition from Muslims not only in Saudi Arabia but also in neighboring Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gcl5RKC5SR3nukgBUXwklQi9kXKg?docId=962e2459-b8d2-4e4a-bf28-d70b66942013&lt;/ref&gt;

The fatwa arose when Al-Mutawa was sued by a Kuwaiti civilian for blasphemy in a court of law in Kuwait in 2014. Al-Mutawa fought the case and won. There was an appeal in 2015 which he won as well.&lt;ref name="ind love"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/the-times/is-it-a-bird-is-it-a-plane-no-its-99-muslim-superheroes/news-story/5ac7fe9f385d6a1513573234b61b5694&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrea Peyser]], columnist at the ''[[New York Post]]'', wrote in October 2010: "Hide your face and grab the kids. Coming soon to a TV in your child's bedroom is a posse of righteous, Sharia-compliant Muslim superheroes, including one who fights crime hidden head-to-toe by a burqa."&lt;ref name="nyp-20101011"&gt;[[Andrea Peyser]]. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20101014042252/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/trading_cape_for_the_burqa_SVLKS5gF1HlJugmRPFJepL Trading cape for the burqa]", ''[[New York Post]]'' (stored at the [[Internet Archive]]), 11 October 2010. Retrieved 26 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, 2014, ''The [[Kuwait Times]]'' reported that [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] members had issued death threats and offered unspecified rewards for the assassination of Dr. Al-Mutawa, via Twitter. Al-Mutawa defended the work saying that he had received clearance from sharia scholars and never would have gone ahead with the project had he not.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.kuwaittimes.net/isil-calls-killing-99-creator/ ISIL calls for killing 'The 99' creator]", kuwaittimes.net, 2 July 2014.
