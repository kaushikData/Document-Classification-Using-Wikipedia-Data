"'''99 Luftballons'''" ({{lang-de|Neunundneunzig Luftballons}}, "99 balloons") is a song by the German band [[Nena (band)|Nena]] from their 1983 [[Nena (album)|self-titled album]]. An English-language version titled "'''99 Red Balloons'''", with lyrics by [[Kevin McAlea]], was also released on the album ''[[99 Luftballons (album)|99 Luftballons]]'' in 1984 after widespread success of the original in Europe and Japan. The English version is not a [[direct translation]] of the German original and contains somewhat different lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 99 Red Balloons – interview with the writer, Kevin McAlea |publisher= Eighty-eightynine |url= http://www.eightyeightynine.com/music/99luftballoons-english.html |accessdate= 17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyrics==
While at a [[The Rolling Stones European Tour 1982|June 1982 concert]] by [[the Rolling Stones]] in [[West Berlin]], Nena's guitarist [[Carlo Karges]] noticed that balloons were being released. As he watched them move toward the horizon, he noticed them shifting and changing shapes, where they looked like strange [[spacecraft]] (referred to in the German lyrics as a "[[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]"). He thought about what might happen if they floated over the [[Berlin Wall]] to the [[East Berlin|Soviet sector]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 15 March 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Also cited by the band was a newspaper article from the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' about five local high school students in 1973 who played a prank to simulate a UFO by launching 99 (one was lost from the original 100) aluminized Mylar balloons attached with ribbons to a traffic flare.  The red flame from the flare reflected by the balloons gave the appearance of a large pulsating red object floating over [[Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area|Red Rock Canyon]] outside the [[Las Vegas Valley]] in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Strange flying object sighted over Red Rock |date= 9 September 1973 |newspaper= [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A direct translation of the title is sometimes given as "Ninety-Nine Air Balloons", but the song became known in English as "Ninety-Nine Red Balloons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The New English-German Dictionary: "Luftballon" |accessdate= 2 June 2007 |url= http://www.iee.et.tu-dresden.de/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/wernerr/search.sh?string=luftballon&amp;nocase=on&amp;hits=50 |quote= ''balloon -- der Luftballon''}} {{dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The New English-German Dictionary: "Balloon" |accessdate= 2 June 2007 |url= http://www.iee.et.tu-dresden.de/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/wernerr/search.sh?string=balloon&amp;nocase=on&amp;hits=50 |quote= ''balloon -- der Ballon, balloon -- der Luftballon''}} {{dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title "99 Red Balloons" almost [[scansion|scans]] correctly with the syllables falling in the right places within the rhythm of the first line of lyrics, although ''Neunundneunzig'' (99) has one syllable more than "ninety-nine".

The lyrics of the original German version tell a story: 99 balloons are mistaken for UFOs, causing a [[General officer|general]] to send pilots to investigate. Finding nothing but children's balloons, the pilots decide to put on a show and shoot them down. The display of force worries the nations along the borders and the [[defence minister]]s on each side bang the drums of conflict to grab power for themselves. In the end, a 99-year war results from the otherwise harmless flight of balloons, causing devastation on all sides without a victor. At the end, the singer walks through the devastated ruins and lets loose a balloon, watching it fly away.&lt;ref name="Compare"&gt;{{cite web|title= 99 Luftballons, Side by Side Comparison |website= In the 80s |accessdate= 29 October 2014|url= http://www.inthe80s.com/redger3.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English version and other re-recordings==
The English version retains the spirit of the original narrative, but many of the lyrics are translated poetically rather than directly translated: red helium balloons are casually released by the civilian singer (narrator) with her unnamed friend into the sky and are registered as missiles by a faulty [[early warning system]]; the balloons are mistaken for military aircraft which results in panic and eventually nuclear war.&lt;ref name="Compare"/&gt;

From the outset Nena and other members of the band expressed disapproval for the English version of the song, "99 Red Balloons". In March 1984, the band's keyboardist and song co-writer [[Jörn-Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen|Uwe Fahrenkrog Petersen]] said, "We made a mistake there. I think the song loses something in translation and even sounds silly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title= A very good group from Germany |magazine= No.1 |date= 17 March 1984 |page= 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview that month the band including Nena herself were quoted as being "not completely satisfied" with the English version since it was "too blatant" for a group not wishing to be seen as a protest band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Andy |last= Strike |title= 99 Red Herrings |magazine= [[Record Mirror]] |date= 10 March 1984 |page= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having given in excess of 500 concerts over a period of more than 30 years, Nena has never sung "99 Red Balloons" live, even at her rare concerts in England, always performing the German version instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Nena tours and setlists |url= http://www.nena.de/gigografie |publisher= Nena.de |accessdate= 10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2015}}

There have been two re-recordings of the original German version of the song that have been released by Nena: a modern version in 2002, which was included on ''[[Nena feat. Nena]]'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Nena feat. Nena – 20 Jahre by Nena |url= https://itunes.apple.com/de/album/nena-feat.-nena-20-jahre/id79336560?l=en |publisher= [[iTunes]] DE. [[Apple Inc.]] |accessdate= 27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a retro version in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 99 Luftballons – Single by Nena |url= https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/99-luftballons-single/id587139487 |publisher= [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] US. [[Apple Inc.]] |accessdate= 27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included some verses in French.

Live recordings of the song are included on all seven of Nena's live albums, dating from 1995 to 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 99 Luftballons |url= http://www.nena.de/de/99-luftballons |website= Nena.de |accessdate= 8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Live at SO36 |url= http://www.nena.de/de/discografie/live-so36 |website= Nena.de |accessdate= 8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Nichts Versäumt Live |website= Nena.de |accessdate= 9 November 2018 |url= https://www.nena.de/en/node/2505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special edit that combined the English and German versions of the song was played on [[American Top 40]] with [[Casey Kasem]] for the week of 24 March 1984 (Program #814-12).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Pete |last= Battistini |year= 2010 |title= American Top 40 with Casey Kasem (the 1980s) |publisher= AuthorHouse |page= 224 |isbn= 978-1-45205-038-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
American and Australian audiences preferred the original German version, which became a very successful non-English-language song, topping charts in both countries, reaching {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}1}} on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' chart, [[Kent Music Report]], and {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}2}} on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], behind "[[Jump (Van Halen song)|Jump]]" by [[Van Halen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title= March 3, 1984 – The Hot 100 |url= http://www.billboard.com/charts/1984-03-03/hot-100 |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 3 March 1984 |accessdate= 17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was certified [[RIAA certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. The later-released English translation, "99 Red Balloons", topped the charts in the UK, Canada and Ireland.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IRL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UK"/&gt;

[[VH1 Classic]], an American cable television station, ran a charity event for [[Hurricane Katrina]] relief in 2006. Viewers who made donations were allowed to choose which [[music video]]s the station would play. One viewer donated $35,000 for the right to program an entire hour and requested continuous play of "99 Luftballons" and "99 Red Balloons" videos. The station broadcast the videos as requested from 2:00 to 3:00 pm [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] on 26 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title= VH1 Classic to Air the Classic 80s Music Video '99 Luftballons' for an Entire Hour on Sunday, 26 March |date= 22 March 2006 |publisher= [[VH1 Classic]].

In his 2010 book ''[[Music: What Happened?]]'', critic and musician [[Scott Miller (pop musician)|Scott Miller]] declared that the song possesses "one of the best [[Hook (music)|hook]]s of [[1980s in music|the eighties]]" and listed it among his top song picks for 1984. Nonetheless, he cautioned: "It must be admitted that this song suffers from an embarrassingly out-of-place disco funk interlude, and the word ''kriegsminister''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Scott |last= Miller |authorlink= Scott Miller (pop musician) |title= Music: What Happened? |year= 2010 |page= 120 |publisher= 125 Books |location= Alameda, CA |isbn= 978-0-61538-196-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The promotional video, which was originally made for the Dutch music programme ''[[TopPop]]'' and broadcast on 13 March 1983, was shot in a Dutch military training camp, the band performing the song on a stage in front of a backdrop of fires and explosions provided by the [[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch Army]]. Towards the end of the video, the band are seen taking cover and abandoning the stage, which was unplanned and genuine since they believed the explosive blasts were getting out of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Rolf |last= Brendel |year= 2014 |title= Nena – Geschichte einer Band |publisher= Aufbau Verlag GmbH &amp; Co |location= Berlin |pages= 131–5 |isbn= 978-3-35105-015-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the video was used for a $200,000 fundraising campaign for Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. [[MTV Classic (U.S. TV network)|VH1 Classic]] played the English and German versions for an hour straight as part of [[Mercy Corps]]' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Laura |last= Barcella |year= 2012 |title= The End: 50 Apocalyptic Visions from Pop Culture That You Should Know About...Before It's Too Late |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3N43BP2jqlEC&amp;pg=PA16 |accessdate= 19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A World Apart''''' is a 1988 anti-[[apartheid]] [[drama (genre)|drama]], written by [[Shawn Slovo]] and directed by [[Chris Menges]]. It is based on the lives of Slovo's parents, [[Ruth First]] and [[Joe Slovo]].  The film was a [[co-production (filmmaking)|co-production]] between companies from the UK and [[Zimbabwe]], where the movie was filmed. It features [[Hans Zimmer]]'s first non-collaborative [[film score]].

==Plot==
Set in [[Johannesburg]] in 1963, the film examines the abrupt ending of 13-year-old Molly's blithe childhood when her father, a member of the [[South African Communist Party]], flees into exile. Ostracised by her peers, Molly draws closer to her mother who is part of the campaign against [[apartheid]]. Their relationship is challenged by hardship, political intimidation, and the mother's eventual arrest.

The film title references both the gap between the mother and her teenage girl, who fails to grasp why their family is so fixated with events beyond their comfortable white suburb, and another separating this world from that of South Africa's poverty-stricken black townships. 

Essentially, the film is a tribute to [[Ruth First]] by her daughter and concludes in a moment of epiphany as Molly comes to terms with her mother's activism and understands that she too must play a part in the struggle against racial injustice.

The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' attributes the term to [[Franklin P. Adams]], a writer who coined it as an anagram of ''patronym'', to emphasize "apt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title =aptronym |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/30911/aptronym|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |accessdate=2008-07-19 |location= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Frank Nuessel, in ''The Study of Names'' (1992), an ''aptonym'' is the term used for "people whose names and occupations or situations (e.g., workplace) have a close correspondence."

In the book ''What's in a Name?'' (1996), author [[Paul Dickson (writer)|Paul Dickson]] cites a long list of aptronyms originally compiled by Professor Lewis P. Lipsitt, of [[Brown University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dickson|first1=Paul|title=What's in a Name? Reflections of an Irrepressible Name Collector|date=1996|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=Springfield, Mass.|isbn=0-87779-613-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Carl Jung]] wrote in his book ''[[Synchronicity (book)|Synchronicity]]'' that there was a "sometimes quite grotesque coincidence between a man's name and his peculiarities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9664000/9664697.stm "When the name fits the job"] BBC. Retrieved 26 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nominative determinism]] is a hypothesis which suggests a causal relationship based on the idea that people tend to be attracted to areas of work that fit their name.

'''''Beatlemania''''' was a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theater|musical]] [[revue]] focused on the music of [[The Beatles]] as it related to the events and changing attitudes of the tumultuous 1960s. A "[[rockumentary]]," advertised as "''Not the Beatles, but an incredible simulation'',"&lt;ref name=4Young&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1977/04/05/75061713.html?pageNumber=41 "Four Young Musicians to Simulate Beatles,"] ''New York Times'' (April 5, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; it ran from 1977 to 1979&lt;ref&gt;Itzkoff, Dave. [https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/beatles-concert-show-let-it-be-coming-to-broadway/ "ARTSBEAT; Beatles Concert Show Coming to Broadway,"] ''New York Times'' (May 9, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; for a total of 1,006 performances.

== Synopsis ==
''Beatlemania'' took the form of a roughly chronological history of The Beatles via their music. About 50&lt;ref name=4Young /&gt; songs were performed during the show. Other than some onstage banter, there was very little dialogue during the production, which consisted mostly of exact re-enactments of the Beatles' music. The multimedia production was notable for its extensive use of backdrops, slides, newspaper headlines, and video footage to evoke the 1960s and iconic Beatle moments.&lt;ref name=Rockwell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Klein /&gt;

== Productions ==
Beatles [[tribute bands]] predated ''Beatlemania'' — notably [[Rain: A Tribute to the Beatles|Rain]] (which debuted in 1975)&lt;ref name=rgj&gt;Sion, Mike. [http://www.rgj.com/story/life/2015/01/21/rain-new-generation-takes-reins-beatles-tribute/22132047/ "Rain: New generation takes reins of Beatles tribute,"] ''Reno Gazette-Journal'' (January 23, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; — but ''Beatlemania'' was the first production to create a full multimedia theatrical experience.

Originally conceived and produced by Steve Leber and David Krebs,&lt;ref name=4Young /&gt; ''Beatlemania'' debuted in Boston at the [[Colonial Theatre (Boston)|Colonial Theatre]] in April 1977. It premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on May 31, 1977 (after previewing since May 26 — although no critics were invited),&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;Klein, Alvin. [http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/11/16/112061666.html?pageNumber=340 'Beatlemania' Captures the Panorama of a Decade,"] ''New York Times'' (November 16, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; with cast members Joe Pecorino ("[[John Lennon|John]]"), Mitch Weissman ("[[Paul McCartney|Paul]]"), [[Les Fradkin]] ("[[George Harrison|George]]"), and Justin McNeill ("[[Ringo Starr|Ringo]]").&lt;ref name=Rockwell&gt;Rockwell, John. [http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1977/06/17/92246641.html?pageNumber=53 "Stage: 'Beatlemania's' Formula Is Sincerely Flattering,"] ''New York Times'' (June 17, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Quickly achieving sellout status without ever having an official "opening night", ''Beatlemania'' saw great success and coverage in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', ''[[Us (magazine)|Us]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. For the first six months, every ticket for the show was sold out.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

The production was nominated for the 1978 [[Tony Award]] for Best Lighting Design by designer [[Jules Fisher]], while the sound engineer was longtime industry veteran William (Bill) Rofot. Season 3 of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s ''[[Weekend Update]]'' (airing March 15, 1978) parodied the show when [[Dan Aykroyd]] mentioned "''Beatlemaniamania'': not ''Beatlemania'', but an incredible simulation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77oupdate.phtml "77o: Christopher Lee / Meat Loaf: Weekend Update with Jane Curtin &amp; Dan Aykroyd,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219090708/http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77oupdate.phtml |date=February 19, 2018 }} Saturday Night Live Transcripts website. Accessed March 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beatlemania'' ran until October 17, 1979, for a total of 1006 performances; grossing more than $40 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20080198,00.html "Picks and Pans Review: Beatlemania—the Movie,"] ''People'' Vol. 16, No. 11 (September 14, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;  During its New York run, the show moved to the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]] and finally the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]].  

As the show expanded in its formative years, over 50 original cast members formed 10 "bunks" (or casts of a single set of four). As the New York show continued its run, shows were opened in Los Angeles, Chicago, Cincinnati, and London. At its peak, ''Beatlemania'' had several permanent shows in several cities around the world and several semi-temporary shows in many more cities in the U.S. and the rest of the world. 

After closing on Broadway, the ''Beatlemania Bus and Truck Tour'' began, running until 1983 and touring across the United States and worldwide. Short-term tours of Australia, Europe, Asia, and Africa were produced after 1982.

An updated show, ''With the Beatles'', was created as a tribute to the musical in 1983.

The 1986 decision in a lawsuit by the Beatles production company [[Apple Corps]] officially ended the show for a period of time, but revival tours still continue today, under such names as  ''Beatlemania: Yesterday and Today''&lt;ref&gt;Weizel, Richard. [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/13/nyregion/years-of-yesterdays-and-yeah-yeah-yeah.html "Years of Yesterdays And Yeah, Yeah, Yeah,"] ''New York Times'' (May 13, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Beatlemania Now''.&lt;ref&gt;Plasko, Joe. [http://www.tnonline.com/2010/sep/13/beatlemania-now "Beatlemania Now: Tribute paid to the Fab Four and the 1960's,"] ''[[Times News (Pennsylvania)|Times News]]'' (September 13, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Beatlemania: The Album'' ==
In 1978, ''Beatlemania'' released a self-titled original cast album of the show which included contributions from the first and second cast of performers from the show (as well as five additional off-stage musicians — keyboards; violin; cello; sax/flute/recorder; trumpet/picollo trumpet and oboe). Released on [[Arista Records]] in 1978, the album received warm audience reaction, even placing on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for several weeks, before falling into obscurity. 

Tracks from the album included most but not all of the original show's song list, and several of the tracks were either re-recorded entirely or partially re-recorded in the studio. Cast members that appear on the album include Mitch Weissman, Joe Pecorino, [[Les Fradkin]], Justin McNeill, Randy Clark, Reed Kailing, P. M. Howard, and Bobby Taylor.

== ''Beatlemania: The Movie'' ==
After three years of production USA Video Productions took an interest in making a film version of the ''Beatlemania'' stage show. After a brief contract negotiation, ''Beatlemania: The Movie'' began production in late 1980 (shortly before the [[murder of John Lennon]]). Directed by Joseph Manduke, the film's cast featured Mitch Weissman (bass guitar; "Paul"), David Leon (rhythm guitar; "John"), Tom Teeley (lead guitar; "George"), and Ralph Castelli (drums; "Ringo").&lt;ref name=Rosenbaum&gt;Rosenbaum, Jonathan. [http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/beatlemania/Film?oid=1056339 "Beatlemania,"] ''Chicago Reader''. Accessed March 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beatlemania: The Movie'' was released in the summer of 1981 and received negative reviews. [[Janet Maslin]] of ''The New York Times'', "''Beatlemania'' was a horror on the stage, and it's even more of a horror at close range, where the seams really show. This isn't a loving impersonation, or even an honest one. It's cheap, disingenuous and loathsome."&lt;ref&gt;Maslin, Janet. [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/07/movies/beatlemania-their-lives-our-times.html 'BEATLEMANIA,' THEIR LIVES, OUR TIMES,"] ''New York Times'' (August 7, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' wrote, "My idea of hell is being forced at gunpoint to resee this ... atrocity, ... based on a terrible stage musical."&lt;ref name=Rosenbaum /&gt; Other observers{{who|date=March 2016}} criticized the film for being too artsy and not worthy of being associated with the stageshow; plans for a follow-up film were immediately cancelled.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

== Apple Corps lawsuit==
In 1979, [[Apple Corps]] sued show creator Steve Leber and ''Beatlemania''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s producers, alleging that Apple Corps owned various publicity rights and trademarks, and Leber and others "appropriated to themselves" the value of those trademarks and the Beatles' goodwill and fame without paying for it. In 1986, Los Angeles Superior Court judge Paul Breckenridge found in favor of Apple Corps, and ordered Leber and Beatlemania Inc. to pay Apple $5.6 million, plus 7% interest from September 1979. He also found that Apple was entitled to a court order barring the further unconsented use or exploitation of the Beatles, and that Beatlemania's actions "amounted to virtually a complete appropriation of the Beatles' persona" without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The judge also found that [[Ely Landau]] and the This Is The Week That Was Beatlemania Company, which produced the ''Beatlemania'' film, were liable $2 million and 7% interest, also payable to Apple Corps.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;Reuters.

== Cast members ==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
Because of the vocal strain (especially for "Paul") involved in doing 10 or more shows per week, each production utilized two (2) casts or "bunks," as they were dubbed by musical director Sandy Yaguda. The Original Broadway production featured Bunk 1 (Mitch Weissman, Joe Pecorino, Les Fradkin and Justin McNeill).&lt;ref name=Rockwell /&gt; and Bunk 2 (Randy Clark, Reed Kailing, P.M. Howard, and Bobby Taylor). Subsequent cast members of the Leber-Krebs production are known as "Original" cast members, as the show expanded with several touring casts. 

Casts and casting became independent after 1984 as revival and current casts tour under many different Beatle-related nomenclatures. (It is common practice for other Beatles tribute bands to promote themselves falsely as "Original Broadway Cast".){{cn|date=March 2016}}

'''''Bo Jackson Baseball''''' is a [[baseball]] video game that was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] and [[IBM PC]]-compatibles. The game features athlete [[Bo Jackson]], who at the time of the game's release was a star in professional baseball and a former professional [[American football|football]] player. In Europe, the game was released by [[Mindscape]] as '''''TV Sports: Baseball''''', part of the ''TV Sports'' series that included ''[[TV Sports: Basketball]]'' and other games based on hockey and American football.

==Gameplay==
[[File:BoJacksonBaseballScreenshot.png|175px|left|thumb|Someone has successfully hit the ball and it looks like it's going to go towards the back wall of the stadium.]]

An option allows the player to play anywhere from five to nine innings.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt; Players can choose to throw five different kinds of pitches either slowly, at a normal speed, or very rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=90| title = Pitching information | publisher = [[allgame]]| date = | accessdate = 2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nintendo Power]] gave this game a 2.8 out of 5 in their September 1991 review while [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] issued a 4.25 out of 10 review in their October 1991 issue of their magazine.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt;

Players can either play in exhibition mode or playoff mode. Either one or two players can participate. In addition to those options, a ''CPU vs CPU'' mode and a ''CPU vs CPU quick mode'' are available in order to quicken up a tournament; the purpose is to see the stats of that particular match and quickly end tournaments. The game uses city names but not the team names because of not having any proper licensing with Major League Baseball.&lt;ref name="mobygames"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/bo-jackson-baseball| title = Additional release information | publisher = [[MobyGames]]| date = | accessdate = 2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the players are purely fictional and they cannot be edited. Some of the player names are parodies of real life baseball players (such as Baltimore's "Kenrip" being a not-so-subtle parody of [[Cal Ripken]]).

There is even a [[cheat code]] that allows players to play as an all-Bo Jackson baseball team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cheatscodesguides.com/nes-cheats/bo-jackson-baseball/| title = All-Bo Team Information | publisher = Cheat Codes Guides| date = | accessdate = 2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commodore Amiga version includes a [[Sports league|league]] mode that the NES version doesn't have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/docs.php?id=229| title = Commodore Amiga instruction manual for ''Bo Jackson Baseball'' | publisher = Lemon Amiga| date = | accessdate = 2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Amiga version of ''Bo Jackson Baseball'' has enhanced 16-bit graphics that are superior to the NES version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hol.abime.net/3405| title = Commodore Amiga information for ''Bo Jackson Baseball'' | publisher = Abime| date = | accessdate = 2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that the IBM version of ''Bo Jackson'' was best as an arcade game and, because of its lack of real players' statistics, less successful than competitors as a simulation.&lt;ref name="rogers199205"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=94 | title=Bo Knows Arcade Baseball | work=Computer Gaming World | date=May 1992 | accessdate=24 November 2013 | author=Rogers, Win | pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7667">The '''British Blues Awards''' were inaugurated in 2010. The prize was awarded in various categories, such as 'Male vocals', 'Female vocals', 'Guitarist', 'Bass player' and 'Keyboard player', 'Blues band', 'Young artist', 'Blues album', 'Blues festival' and 'Lifetime achievement'.

The Awards were suspended in 2017, due to technical problems surrounding the validity of the online public voting system, which over time had become susceptible to abuse.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishbluesawards.com/home/4581355856|title=Home - British Blues Awards|website=Britishbluesawards.com|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15046">'''Chilean electronic music'''  refers to the [[electronic music]] genre and its subgenres produced in [[Chile]] or by Chileans.

==History==
The origins of electronic music in Chile can be found as far back as 1958, when physicist [[Werner Meyer-Eppler]] visited Chile. As a result of his visit, experimentation with electronic music gained support from the scientific community and an electronic music laboratory was established.

In 1959, Jose Visencio Asuar published a thesis entitled "Generación mecánica y electrónica del sonido musical" (Mechanical and Electronic Generation of Musical Sound), and to demonstrate his thesis he composed "Variaciones espectrales" (Spectral Variations), the first piece of electronic music in Chile.

In 1966, at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile | Universidad Católica]], Samuel Claro released his second electronic music album, ''Estudio N°1''.

Asuar released ''Estudio Aletorio'' in 1962 and ''Ambientes Sonoros'' in 1967. Both records were released in Germany (Karlsruhe) and Venezuela (Caracas).

In 1968, Tomás Lefever composed 19 electronic tracks and released ''Klesis'', a compilation album containing works by Amenábar and Asuar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Claro |first=Samuel |authorlink=Samuel |last2=Urrutia Blondel |first2=Jorge |authorlink2=Jorge Urrutia Blondel |date=1973 |title=Historia de la musica en Chile |edition=1st |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0033099.pdf/ |accessdate= August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is not clear when exactly the electronic music movement as it is known today reached Chile. At the beginning of the 1990s a small underground movement had emerged, with DJs such as [[Cristian Vogel]], [[Ricardo Villalobos]], [[Matías Aguayo]] and [[Sergio Orrego]], the opening of the specialist store Background, and small scale events like “Barracudas” in 1992, “Corriente Alterna” (1993), “Distrito Distinto” (1993), “Background” (1994), “Avanzada multimedia” (1994), “Frontera Final” (1995) and “Spandex Parties” taking place through the 1990s. However, most commentators see the true birth of electronica in Chile at the Alacran Peninsula in the city of [[Arica]], in an event that took place during the solar eclipse of November 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zona.cl/download/pdf/rave.pdf “CUANDO LA LUNA CHOCO CON EL SOL” (When the moon crash with the sun)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508223650/http://www.zona.cl/download/pdf/rave.pdf |date=2014-05-08 }} Originally from Zona de contacto, zona.cl by Hernán Roríguez Matte, November 18, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The solar eclipse took place on November 3, 1994, with excellent views available in northern Chilean cities such as Arica, drawing astronomers from around the world to observe the rare phenomenon in the area’s [[Astronomy in Chile|uniquely clear skies]]. A group of [[electronic music|electronica]] fans and DJs decided to use the eerie eclipse landscape as a backdrop to host Chile's first rave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euphorianews.wordpress.com/2008/01/27/articulando-la-electronica-en-chile/ ARTICULANDO LA ELECTRÓNICA EN CHILE] taken from ''Euphoria'' magazine, February 03, 2008, Santiago, Chile&lt;/ref&gt; The event was sponsored by the German clothing manufacturer Pash and took place outdoors in the Scorpion Peninsula, opposite to the historic [[Morro de Arica]]. Ravers could observe the eclipse and wait for its shadow to pass, with electronic music as a soundtrack. DJs who took part in the rave included [[John Acquaviva]], [[Richie Hawtin]], [[Ricardo Villalobos]], [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], [[Pascal (musician)|Pascal]], Siddhartha and [[Adrian]].

Though it was a small event, the Alacran rave has gained near legendary status in Chile and has become a landmark in the country's electronic scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euphorianews.wordpress.com/2010/05/17/desde-la-revista-la-noche EUPHORIA, 18 AÑOS DESARROLLANDO LA CULTURA DE LA MÚSICA ELECTRÓNICA] Extract taken from La Noche, independent free distribution magazine, based on Santiago Chile, May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the scene has grown fast and massive events have taken place in many of Chile's major cities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.800.cl/archives/9155 Historia de la música electrónica en Chile] 800.cl Santiago, Chile, October 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; including “C[C2] reamfields”, “Sensation White” (a spin-off from [[Amsterdam]]’s “Sensation”), and Ultra Music, an event that first appeared in [[Miami]].

In the last decade, techno and house music, mostly inspired by the movement in Berlin, has grown in Santiago. These underground scene has been recorded by labels like Comeme and Pirotecnia with stars from the scene like Alejandro Paz and Mamacita. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.latercera.com/noticia/el-underground-electronico-sale-a-luz/ El Underground Electrónico sale a la luz, La Tercera] &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Society for Chilean Music (SIMUC)]] has a [[podcast]] called ''MEC''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simuc.org/sections/podcasts/mec/ MEC], a podcast on Chilean electronic music by the [[International Society for Chilean Music (SIMUC)]]&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated exclusively to Chilean electronic music. The first episode was aired on September 30, 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1622">'''Cococubs''' were a set of 32 hollowcast hand-painted lead [[figurine|figures]] of [[anthropomorphic]] creatures given away with [[Cadburys]] Bournville [[Cocoa solids|Cocoa]] from 1934 to 1939.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Britains Civilian Toy Soldiers |last=Joplin |first=Norman |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher=Schiffer Publishing |location= |isbn=978-0-7643-1520-6 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were designed by the commercial artist and prolific illustrator of children's books, [[Ernest Aris]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Man Who Drew for Beatrix Potter |last=Aris |first=Ernest |author2=Dudley Chignall|year=2009 |publisher=Lulu Publishing |location= |isbn= |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free gifts were available just as Britain was coming out of a [[great depression|depression]] where few families had spare income to indulge their children with toys. The scheme was a huge success, and within a few weeks of the campaign Cadburys ran out of the supplies of both the drinking chocolate and the Cococubs. It was only after a delay of two months that supplies were again on sale.

It was hailed by the ''Grocery Merchants Journal'' as "One of the cleverest publicity schemes of the year. It is difficult to over-estimate the sales value of such a scheme."&lt;ref&gt;The Grocery &amp; Provision Merchant, November 1934, p.276&lt;/ref&gt; Some 300,000 children subsequently joined the Cococub Club, which issued a 'Newspaper' to its members together with a badge and membership card.

The game was released in Europe on April 28, 2006, followed shortly by a North American release on May 15 and a Japanese release on July 12. Unlike previous ''DDR'' arcade releases, all versions have the same features and song list. It is the 5th arcade release in Europe, the 3rd arcade release in North America, and the 9th arcade release in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Features==
===Characters===
''SuperNova'' reintroduces characters, after their absence from ''[[DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution 6thMix|DDRMAX]]'' games and ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Extreme]]''. In ''SuperNova'', character selection is random by default, but can be changed in the options menu. The following eight characters are available:
{{div col}}
* Afro
* Baby-Lon
* Emi
* Gus (new)
* Rage
* Jenny
* Robo-Zukin (new)
* Ruby (new)
{{div col end}}
''SuperNova 2'' retains these characters while adding six new characters and a dedicated character selection screen, for a total of 14 characters. Three of the new characters (Alice, Julio and Yuni) and all returning characters, with the exception of Robo-Zukin, also receive a second costume, for a total of 23 costumes. The following new characters are available:
{{div col}}
* Alice
* Dark-Zukin
* Concent Be-fU
* Concent Kyo-fU
* Julio
* Yuni
{{div col end}}
Of the 14 characters, 10 return in ''[[Dance Dance Revolution A]]''. The Concent and Zukin pairs are unavailable.

===e-Amusement===
The game supported [[e-Amusement]] functionality in Asia, with limited testing outside of Asia.

===Link Data (cancelled)===
Link Data was a planned feature for the ''Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova'' series designed to provide connectivity between the arcade and [[PlayStation 2]] versions of the game, by means of a PlayStation 2 [[memory card]]. The reader was depicted in arcade flyers, but it was never released. This feature already existed in ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Extreme]]'' and several earlier releases, but used [[PlayStation (console)|original PlayStation]] memory cards and readers instead, which ''SuperNova'' does not support. Supplier issues with Sony forced Konami to cancel the functionality. To compensate, Konami offered a coupon or soundtrack sampler for customers in [[North America]] who purchased the game in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Konami America |title=Arcade Linking Function |url=http://www.konami.com:80/edealinv/servlet/ExecMacro?nurl=control/Support.vm&amp;ctl_nbr=3810 |accessdate=July 12, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217142714/http://www.konami.com/edealinv/servlet/ExecMacro?nurl=control%2FSupport.vm&amp;ctl_nbr=3810 |archivedate=December 17, 2006 |date=December 17, 2006 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The game was released in North America on May 15, 2006, with the first confirmed sighting at [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]] at the [[Tomorrowland]] Starcade. Its release in Japan was delayed slightly so that the game software could be updated to fix the reported timing issues, and was later released with an extra song (the aforementioned remix of Flow) in late July 2006.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Music==
{{Main|Music of Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova}}

'''''Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2''''', sometimes abbreviated as '''''DDR SN2''''', was released on August 22, 2007 by [[Konami]] to Japanese arcades and on February 21, 2008 for the [[PlayStation 2]] counterpart. In North America, a slightly different PlayStation 2 version was released first on September 25, 2007 before that region's arcade release on January 17, 2008. It is the final arcade release to be powered by the PlayStation 2 by means of the Python 2 arcade board.

SuperNova 2 features the standard gameplay modes as well as new modes to challenge seasoned players. The soundtrack ranges from classic Konami Originals to new pop and dance standards. The console version in North America features songs by [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Ian Van Dahl]] and [[Goldfrapp]]. Also featured is [[EyeToy]] support for additional gameplay elements as well as mini-games using the camera and online play through the PlayStation Network allowing players to face-off with other players across the country. The game was well received as a solid addition to the DDR lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ps2.ign.com/objects/949/949450.html |title=Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA 2 |accessdate=2008-04-23 |publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Arcade===
The original ''Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova'' arcade release in North America reached sales of about 250 brand new cabinets by distributor Betson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DSG Vintage Arcade Post-Mortem (For Now) |url=https://dsgcw.blogspot.com/2015/08/dsg-vintage-arcade-post-mortem-for-now.html |website=Desert Sky Games |accessdate=October 25, 2018 |date=August 18, 2015 |quote=It turned out to be an original first-run dedicated (not converted) unit, one of about 250 ever built by exclusive distributor Betson Vending using internals supplied by Sony and Konami.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion kits were also available, upgrading a machine with ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Extreme]]'' or older to SuperNova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BETM 023116N: DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION SUPERNOVA KIT |url=http://www.betson.com:80/products/amusement/BETM-023116N |website=Betson Enterprises |accessdate=October 27, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110110737/http://www.betson.com:80/products/amusement/BETM-023116N |archivedate=January 10, 2008 |date=January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2018, there are 337 ''SuperNova'' and ''SuperNova 2'' arcade machines available worldwide, of which 253 are located in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arcades |url=https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/arcades.php |website=Zenius -I- vanisher.com |accessdate=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Americas: 162 SN and 91 SN2 --&gt;

In North America, Konami partnered with Betson to distribute ''SuperNova'' and ''SuperNova 2'' to arcades. The partnership resulted in "lower quality footpads and monitors" compared to Japan, though still of better quality than the infamous ''[[Dance Dance Revolution X]]'' and ''[[Dance Dance Revolution X2|X2]]'' arcade releases in North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Knoop |first1=Joseph |title=The rise, fall and return of Dance Dance Revolution in America |url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/12/11/16290772/the-rise-fall-and-return-of-dance-dance-revolution-in-america |website=Polygon |accessdate=October 25, 2018 |date=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donaldism''' is the [[fandom]] associated with [[Disney]] [[comics]] and [[Animated cartoon|cartoons]]. The name refers to [[Donald Duck]] and was first used by author [[Jon Gisle]] in his book ''Donaldismen'' in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1goTERg-s28C |page=255 |title=Understanding Disney: the manufacture of fantasy |author=Janet Wasko |isbn= 978-0-7456-1484-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Donaldismen: En muntert-vitenskapelig studie over Donald Duck og hans verden |author=Jon Gisle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jS-7QQAACAAJ |year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some (especially [[Europe]]an) countries, donaldism is mainly centred on comics and comic strips, while in other countries, e.g. the [[United States|US]], these are largely neglected while motion pictures and shorts are relatively much more popular. Originally the term, as defined by Gisle, referred to a "Research branch as well as the material that is the object this research. In the latter meaning, the word denotes every Disney signed comic story. In the former meaning, donaldism is a branch of comics research, specialising in the study of precisely Disney's production." While this original meaning of the word was defined in 1973, today donaldism tends to also cover general fandom within Disney comics and even motion pictures and shorts.

Although the term refers directly to the ''[[Scrooge McDuck universe|Duck universe]]'', it includes other Disney universes.

== Donaldist ==
A '''donaldist''' is a supporter of donaldism: a [[fan (aficionado)|fan]] or [[research]]er of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] [[comics]].

According to the 1977 manifest of [[Norway|Norwegian]] donaldist society "Donaldistene", "donaldists are [[Donald Duck]] fans who study ''Donald Duck &amp; Co'' [Norwegian Disney [[comic book]], editor] from social and political structures and viewpoints. Moreover, they try in the best possible way to preserve donaldistic cultural material for their own and others' collections."

Part of Donaldist culture is to create [[backronym]]s for names and titles; this usage stems from [[Carl Barks|Carl Barks's]] [[Junior Woodchucks]] comics, where the scout leaders generally had long and pompous titles, leading to jocular [[acronym]]s.

The term Donaldist has been used in authorized Disney publications: the collector-themed [[Gemstone Publishing]] album series ''[[Walt Disney Treasures]]'' was advertised with the slogan/question, "Are You a Donaldist?"

== Donaldistic research ==
One of the first, important discoveries was in 1960 when U.S. American fan John Spicer wrote the first fan letter to [[Carl Barks]], to which  Barks replied. Until then, [[Walt Disney]] was thought to have drawn and written all comics himself, although fans suspected otherwise. It was later discovered that [[Walt Disney|Disney]] himself had only been involved in the production of a handful of comics.

In 1973 Jon Gisle published the [[Donald Duck]] analysis ''Donaldismen. En muntert-vitenskapelig studie over Donald Duck og hans verden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gabrielsen|first=Bjørn|title=Kvikt om kvakk|newspaper=[[Dagens Næringsliv]]|date=21 October 2006|page=64|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donaldistic research is still being performed, although generally at a lower frequency than in the 1970s and '80s. Research results today are typically presented in [[fanzine]]s or in [[website|Internet websites]].

=== Denmark ===
Although Gisle's book was translated into Danish with the title "Andeologien" ("The Donald / Duck [[-logy|-ology]]"), after Donald's Danish name "Anders And", currently the Norwegian/international term "donaldism" is the most commonly used.

In [[Denmark]], one of the main sources for donaldistic research and other donaldistic articles is ''Carl Barks &amp; Co.'', with [[Freddy Milton]] as editor and main driving force. The first issue was published in 1974, and the fanzine continued until 2000 at a varied frequency; sometimes several issues per year, sometimes years passed without an issue. The fanzine presented much donaldistic research, including a large index of Danish [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] [[comic book]]s (which is now maintained by the Inducks project and the original authors). Despite its name, the fanzine contained material on various fields within Disney [[comics]], but still with an overweight on material about [[Carl Barks]], the passing of whom unleashed the discontinuation of the fanzine.

In 2001 a Danish donaldistic society (''Dansk Donaldist-Forening'' in [[Danish language|Danish]]) was formed by a group of Danish donaldists and the following year the first issue of their fanzine ''DDF(R)appet'' was published. DDF(R)appet has a publication frequency of approximately two issues per year, and among its articles are a few research presentations.

Other notable (comics) fanzines which are not donaldistic as such but still carry donaldistic material from time to time are: ''Nørd-nyt'', ''Rackham'', ''Seriejournalen'', and ''Strip!''.

* ''Ankkalinnan Pamaus'' (1999- )
* ''Sarjainfo'' (1972- ) (General Comics information)

=== Germany ===

''D.O.N.A.L.D.'' (''Deutsche Organisation nichtkommerzieller Anhänger des lauteren Donaldismus'' or the German Organization of Non-commercial Devotees of Pure Donaldism) is the donaldistic society of [[Germany]]. Founded by [[Hans von Storch]], it has presented many contributions to donaldistic research through its fanzine ''Der Donaldist''. It also holds several meetings and one congress each year.

Donaldists have risen in rank and are actively infiltrating the culture pages of several important newspapers in Germany, such as the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], where they subtly install quotations easily recognisable to fans of the comics. The German study of Donaldism is decisively influenced by the German translations of Barks's comic books by [[Erika Fuchs]].

They were also influential when the ''Museum for Comic and Language-Art'', called ''Erika-Fuchs-Haus''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erika-fuchs.de/&lt;/ref&gt; was opened in [[Schwarzenbach an der Saale]], Fuchs' main living place, in 2015.

=== Norway ===

==== ''Donaldisten'' (''The Donaldist'') ====
In the homeland of donaldism, [[Norway]], the fanzine ''Donaldisten'' (''The Donaldist'') has been published since 1973. The donaldistic society ''Gammeldonaldismens Venner'' (''Friends of the Early Donaldism''), founded 1975, issued ''Donaldisten'' in the years 1975-88. Focusing on Jon Gisle's definition of donaldism, the issues contain many research results.

In 1995 publication of Donaldisten was continued by a new society, ''Donaldistene'' (''The Donaldists''), but after only one issue, a nine-year time span passed until another issue was published in 2004. The new society focuses less on research, mirroring a general change among donaldists. Mid 2007, Donaldistene still have only published two issues of Donaldisten, though.

==== Other fanzines ====
March 2007 a new Norwegian fanzine about donaldism entitled ''Kvakk!'' (''Quack!'') was announced, which will bring articles, interviews, and reviews. Behind the fanzine are the same persons who also maintain Norway's most popular website on Disney comics, ''Andeby Online'' (''Duckburg Online''). The first issue will be out in the summer of 2007, and after that there will be four issues released every year.

* ''Carl Barks and The Old Master's Secret'' (1976, one issue)
* ''Duckmite'' (1979, one issue)
* ''Duckburg'' (1981–82, four issues)

=== Sweden ===

[[Sweden]] has a long tradition of publishing donaldistic research and other articles in their fanzine ''NAFS&lt;small&gt;(K)URIREN&lt;/small&gt;'' since 1977. The fanzine is published once or twice a year by the Swedish donaldistic society, ''NAFS&lt;small&gt;(K)&lt;/small&gt;'' (''Nationella Ankistförbundet i Sverige (kvack))'' or ''The Swedish National Donaldism Society (quack)''), founded on September 21, 1976. The local name for Donaldism is "ankism" (lit. "duckism"). Donald Duck's name in Sweden is "Kalle Anka" (loosely translated as "Charlie Duck").

=== U.S.A. ===

* ''The Barks Collector'' (1976- )
* ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' (1976- ) (General comics information)
* ''The Duckburg Times'' (1977- )
* ''The Barks Catalog''
* ''Barksburg'' (1982)
* ''The Duck Hunter'' (1995-1996)

==Plot==
Peng is a carefree [[goose]] whose flock is migrating in [[China]]. His attitude and demeanor is disapproved by leader Bing, who he and his flock abandon while Peng is asleep. Meanwhile, Chi and Chao, a pair of [[ducklings]] on their way to a mystical place called Pleasant Valley, ends up being separated from their flock due to a careless stunt from Peng. To hide from a sinister [[cat]] named Banzou, they end up sleeping with Peng after they see him fending off Banzou. Surprised by their presence, Peng ends up recklessly flying away from them before he breaks his wing with a gong. Flightless and frightened, Peng decides to use the ducklings to fend himself off from predators, and return safely to his flock. The ducklings reluctantly agree to go with him.

After a series of misadventures, Peng starts to grow on the ducklings, however, before he agrees to help the ducklings reunite with their flock, he comes across his own flock, where Chi and Chao discover his true intentions. The two groups end up parting their own separate ways, as they try to get to their destinations. Peng attempts to fly one more time, but is soon knocked down by [[hermit]] [[squirrel]] Carl. Carl builds Peng a makeshift wing for him. Inspired, Peng decides to use the wing to head back to Chi and Chao. However, when the ducklings reunite with their flock, they soon realize that Pleasant Valley is actually a restaurant that serves ducklings. Peng rescues Chi and Chao, however, during their escape, they get separated again. Banzou returns and holds the ducklings hostage, Peng confronts Banzou, but becomes badly injured from fighting him. Chi and Chao light a rocket and launches him into the sky.

Weakened, Peng tries to bring Chi and Chou back with his flock, but a snow storm makes him worse. The ducklings fly him towards the spring where the geese are, and Chao, remembering a honk Peng taught him calls for Peng's girlfriend Jingjing, who ultimately ends up rescuing him. The geese welcome the ducks to their flock, and Bing allows the ducks in the flock, having proven wrong of his judgment towards Peng. Peng introduces Jingjing to Chi and Chao, and tells her that might end up having more children.

In a mid credits scene, Larry, a [[turtle]], makes his way to valley, only to find everyone gone.

An '''experience point''' (often abbreviated to '''exp''' or '''XP''') is a unit of measurement used in tabletop [[role-playing game]]s (RPGs) and [[role-playing video game]]s to quantify a [[player character]]'s progression through the game. Experience points are generally awarded for the completion of missions, overcoming obstacles and opponents, and for successful role-playing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In many RPGs, characters start as fairly weak and untrained. When a sufficient amount of experience is obtained, the character "levels up", achieving the next stage of character development. Such an event usually increases the character's statistics, such as maximum [[health (gaming)|health]], [[magic (gaming)|magic]] and strength, and may permit the character to acquire abilities or improve existing ones. Leveling up may also give the character access to more areas or items.

In some role-playing games, particularly those derived from ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', experience points are used to improve characters in discrete [[#Level-based progression|experience levels]]; in other games, such as ''[[GURPS]]'' and the ''[[World of Darkness]]'' games, experience points are spent on specific abilities or attributes chosen by the player.

In most games, as the difficulty of the challenge increases, the experience rewarded for overcoming it also increases. As players gain more experience points, the amount of experience needed to gain abilities typically increases. Alternatively, games keep the amount of experience points per level constant, but progressively lower the experience gained for the same tasks as the character's level increases.  Thus, as the [[player character]] strengthens from gaining experience, they are encouraged to accept tasks that are commensurate with their improved abilities in order to advance.

==Types==
===Level-based progression===
{{distinguish|Level (video gaming)}}
In games derived from ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (''D&amp;D''), an accumulation of a sufficient number of experience points (XP) increases a character's "level", a number that represents a character's overall skill and experience. To "level" or "level up" means to gain enough XP to reach the next level. By gaining a level, a character's abilities or stats will increase, making the character stronger and able to accomplish more difficult tasks, including safely battling stronger enemies, gaining access to more powerful abilities (such as spells or combat techniques), and to make, fix or disable more complex mechanical devices, or resolve increasingly difficult social challenges.

Typically levels are associated with a [[character class]], and many systems will allow combinations of classes, allowing a player to customize how their character develops.

Some systems that use a level-based experience system also incorporate the ability to purchase specific traits with a set amount of experience; for example, ''D&amp;D'' 3rd Edition bases the creation of [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] items around a system of experience expenditure (known as ''burning xp'') and also uses a system of feat selection which closely matches the advantages of systems such as ''[[GURPS]]'' or the ''[[Hero System]]''. The [[d20 System]] also introduced the concept of [[prestige class]]es which bundle sets of mechanics, character development and requirements into a package which can be "leveled" like an ordinary class.

Some games have a level cap, or a limit of levels available. For example, in the online game ''[[RuneScape]]'', no player can currently get higher than level 120 which needs a combined 104,273,167 experience points to gain, nor can any one skill gain more than 200 million experience.  Some games have a dynamic level cap, where the level cap is dependent upon the levels of the average player (so it gradually increases).

===Activity-based progression===
In some systems, such as the classic tabletop role-playing games ''[[Traveller (role-playing game)|Traveller]]'', ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' and ''[[Basic Role-Playing]]'', and the role-playing video games ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunham|first1=Jeremy|title=Final Fantasy II Review|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/808/808182p1.html|website=IGN|accessdate=2016-05-24|date=2007-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gann|first1=Patrcik|title=RPGFan Reviews - Romancing SaGa|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/romancingsagaminstrel/index.html|website=RPGFan|accessdate=2016-05-24|date=2005-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Grandia (series)|Grandia]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reyes|first1=Francesca|title=Grandia|url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/162/162007p1.html|website=IGN|accessdate=2016-05-24|date=1999-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; series progression is based on increasing individual [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistic]]s (skills, rank and other features) of the character, and is not driven by the acquisition of (general) experience points. The skills and attributes are made to grow through exercised use. Some authors believe that activity-based progression encourages tedious grinding processes, like intentionally taking damage and attacking allied characters to increase health in Final Fantasy II, or forcing player to jump constantly to increase acrobatics skill in The Elder Scrolls series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/26/final-fantasy-ii-review-3ls/] {{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/preview/51830-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-preview|title=The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Preview |website=Gamerevolution.com|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/04/18/skyrim-skills/|title=Skyrim’s Levelling/Skills System Clarified|date=18 April 2011|website=Rockpapershotgun.com|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/final-fantasy-ii-a-retrospective?page=2|title=Final Fantasy II: A Retrospective|date=31 July 2016|website=Ign.com|accessdate=3 February 2018|author=Andy Corrigan|quotation="if you want to get better at something, you need to do a lot of it. [...] it didn’t quite meld well with turn-based combat. Playing in this way off the back of an already grind-heavy predecessor, and having the manipulable stats broken down to this minute degree made the levelling process seem like it would be a huge, impenetrable wall. In fact, there are so many attributes that you can and need to level up independently that I actually nearly gave up in the first few hours when improving them to any significant degree seemed painfully slow going."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free-form advancement===
{{See also|Character point}}
Free-form advancement is used by many role-playing systems including ''[[GURPS]]'', ''[[Hero System]]'' or the ''[[World of Darkness]]'' series. It allows the player to select which skills to advance by allocating "points". Each character attribute is assigned a price to improve, so for example it might cost a character 2 points to raise an [[archery]] skill one notch, 10 points to raise overall [[dexterity]] by one, or it might cost 20 points to learn a new [[Spell (gaming)|magic spell]].

Players are typically free to spend points however they choose, which greatly increases the control that a player has over the character's development, but also usually causes players to find that complexity increases as well. Some games therefore simplify character creation and advancement by suggesting ''packages'' or ''templates'' of pre-selected ability sets, so for example a player could have their character become an "investigator" by purchasing a package deal which includes many skills and abilities, rather than buying them each separately.

===Cash-in advancement===
A cash-in experience advancement system uses experience points to "purchase" such character advancements as class levels, skill points, new skills, feats or increasing saving throw bonuses or base attribute points each of which has a set cost in experience points with set limits on the maximum bonuses that can be purchased at a given time usually once per game session. Once experience points are used thus they are "spent" and are erased from the character record or marked as spent and cannot be used again. ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay]]'' are examples of games that use a cash-in advancement system.

===Hybrid systems===
Some games use advancement systems which combine elements from two or more of the above types. For example, in the third edition of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', whenever a level is gained in a character class, it provides a number of skill points (the exact number is calculated based on the class and the character's intelligence statistic), which can be spent to raise various skills. Character level (generally the sum of a character's total levels in all classes) is used to calculate how high skills can be raised, when an ability score can be raised and when a character can gain new feats (a class of special abilities which include special attacks, proficiencies in various weapons and bonuses on the dice rolls used to determine the outcome of various actions) and how many experience points are needed to advance in level. In ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'', experience points are divided into two categories: base experience and job experience. Gaining base experience increases a character's base level, which is used to calculate a character's maximum [[hit point|HP]] and [[magic point|SP]], increasing base level also provides points which can be spent to increase stats such as strength, agility and intelligence. Gaining job experience increases a character's job level, each job level provides a skill point which can be spent in the job's skill tree to gain a new ability, such as a spell, special attack or passive bonus, or improve an existing ability.

==Video games==
Since many early [[role-playing video game]]s are derived from ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barton|first1=Matt|title=The History of Computer Role-Playing Games Part 1: The Early Years (1980-1983)|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132024/the_history_of_computer_.php|website=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2007-10-30|language=en|date=2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; most use a level-based experience system.

In many games, characters must obtain a minimum level to perform certain actions, such as wielding a particular weapon, entering a restricted area, or earning the respect of a [[non-player character]]. Some games use a system of "character levels", where higher-level characters hold an absolute advantage over those of lower level. In these games, statistical character management is usually kept to a minimum. Other games use a system of "skill levels" to measure advantages in terms of specific aptitudes, such as weapon handling, spell-casting proficiency, and stealthiness. These games allow the players to customize their characters to a greater extent.

Some games, particularly among [[MUD]]s and [[massively multi-player online role-playing game|MMORPG]]s, place a limit on the experience a character gains from a single encounter or challenge, to reduce the effectiveness of [[Powerleveling|power-leveling]].

Remorting is another technique that, while encouraging power-leveling, alleviates its ill effects by giving the player a sense of achievement as it maintains balance with other characters of lower level within the game.

===Perks===
{{see also|Skill tree|Power-up}}

"Perks" are special bonuses that [[video game]] players can add to their characters to give special abilities.  The term refers to the general usage of "[[wiktionary:perk|perk]]" as an abbreviation of "[[wiktionary:perquisite|perquisite]]". Perks are a variation of the [[power-up]] mechanic,&lt;ref name="Shamoon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shamoon|first1=Evan|title=Call of Duty 4 Preview for 360 from 1UP.com|url=http://www.1up.com/previews/call-duty-4_7|website=[[1UP.com]]|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=9 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623225728/http://www.1up.com/previews/call-duty-4_7|archivedate=23 June 2016|date=10 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are permanent rather than temporary and are progressively unlocked through experience points.

The concept of permanent power-ups that are progressively unlocked dates back to the early [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] [[Action role-playing game|action RPGs]], ''[[Deadly Towers]]'' (1986) and ''[[Rygar (Nintendo Entertainment System)|Rygar]]'' (1987), which blurred the line between the power-ups used in [[Action-adventure game|action-adventures]] and the experience points used in [[role-playing video game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Roe R.|last=Adams|work=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=November 1990|issue=76|pages=83–84|title=Westward Ho! (Toward Japan, That Is): An Overview of the Evolution of CRPGs on Dedicated Game Machines|quote=While America has been concentrating on yet another ''Wizardry'', ''Ultima'', or ''Might &amp; Magic'', each bigger and more complex than the one before it, the Japanese have slowly carved out a completely new niche in the realm of CRPG. The first CRPG entries were ''Rygar'' and ''Deadly Towers'' on the NES. These differed considerably from the "action adventure" games that had drawn quite a following on the machines beforehand. Action adventures were basically arcade games done in a fantasy setting such as ''Castlevania'', ''Trojan'', and ''Wizards &amp; Warriors''. The new CRPGs had some of the trappings of regular CRPGs. The character could get stronger over time and gain extras which were not merely a result of a short-term "Power-Up." There were specific items that could be acquired which boosted fighting or defense on a permanent basis. Primitive stores were introduced with the concept that a player could buy something to aid him on his journey.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first video game to use the term "perks" to refer to such a mechanic was possibly the 1997 role-playing video game ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]''. Perks have been used in various other video games in recent times, including [[first-person shooter]]s such as ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'' (2007),&lt;ref name="Shamoon"/&gt; ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' (2009), and ''[[Killing Floor (2009 video game)|Killing Floor]]'' (2009), as well as [[action game]]s such as ''[[Metal Gear Online]]'' (2008).

===Remorting===
"Remorting" (also known as "rebirth", "ascending/ascension", "reincarnating", or "[[new game plus]]") is a game mechanic in some role-playing games whereby, once the player character reaches a specified level limit, the player can elect to start over with a new version of his or her character.  The bonuses that are given are dependent on several factors, which generally involve the stats of the character before the reincarnation occurs.  The remorting character generally loses all levels, but gains an advantage that was previously unavailable, usually access to different [[race (fantasy)|race]]s, [[avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]]s, [[character class|class]]es, skills, or otherwise inaccessible play areas within the game.  A symbol often identifies a remorted character.

The term "remort" comes from [[MUD]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Natalia|title=What is Remort?|url=http://tharsis-gate.org/articles/imaginary/WHATIS~1.HTM|website=Tharsis Gate|publisher=Imaginary Realities|accessdate=2016-05-24|date=May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some of which players may become [[Immortal (MUD)|immortal]] characters—administrative staff—simply by advancing to the maximum level. These users are generally expected to distance themselves from gameplay, and interaction with players may be severely limited. When an immortal chooses to vacate his or her position to resume playing the game—usually from level one just as with any new character—he or she is said to have remorted, "becoming mortal again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Towers|first1=J.

[...] They're the people putting in their time to add new areas and monsters to the realm [...] The day may come when you find yourself in that big comfy chair in the sky.

===Grinding===
{{Main|Grinding (video gaming)}}
Grinding refers to the process of repeating one specific activity over and over. This is done, for example, by repeatedly participating in challenges, quests, tasks and events which reward experience points for performing repetitive, often menial challenges. This definition can also be used in [[Computer games#Multiplayer|multi-player game]]s, but it is typically displaced by a much more charged meaning. A term intended to describe this style of play without pejorative connotation is [[Optimization (role-playing games)|optimization]], also known as  "XP farming".

==={{anchor|Power-Leveling}} Power-leveling===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Power-leveling is using the help of another, stronger player to level a character more quickly than is possible alone.

One kind of power-leveling refers to an experienced character [[Twinking#RPGs|assisting a character of much lower power]] (who is often controlled by the experienced character's controller as an assistant character or improved future main character in training) in defeating enemies that would normally be too powerful for the inexperienced character but are easily and quickly killed by the more powerful character or, in games in which experience points or "credits" are distributed in proportion to group members' levels, weakened almost to the point of death by the more powerful character, who is not grouped with the inexperienced character.  In the latter case, once an enemy is weakened to the point at which the lower-level character can safely finish the kill (usually with the more powerful character's use of healing spells/effects as a backup), the more powerful character uses a spell or effect to stop battle or, if the lower-level character's skills permit, allows itself to be "rescued" by the lower-level character, who then finishes the kill and gets all of the associated experience points. Defeating high-level enemies rewards the lower level character with more experience points than it could otherwise achieve.

A second kind of power-leveling refers to a player paying a company or individual to play and level-up their character.  The customer provides the company with the username and password for their account, and the company assigns an employee to play the character for the customer until a desired level is reached.  This is against the [[Terms of Service|terms of service]] of many games and, if caught, may result in the character being banned. There are also risks involved, as an unscrupulous service may "steal" the character, for later resale to another customer.

Power-leveling increased in ''[[EverQuest]]'' as it became more common to sell characters through the [[Internet]]. Techniques of [[kill stealing]] and [[Powergaming|power-gaming]] would make this pursuit considerably more attractive.

To combat power-leveling and leeching, some [[game designer]]s have devised better means of rewarding a player based on their actual contribution to the completion of the task. Another method used is to cap how much experience a character can gain at any single moment. For example, the game might not allow a character to gain more than 20% of the experience they need to level up by defeating an enemy. This is controversial in that it also punishes players who are skilled enough to face challenges more difficult than regular players or that band together with other players to face more difficult challenges.  

Another anti-power-leveling method, popularized through widespread adoption of the CircleMUD code base, is to distribute experience points from an enemy across a party ''[[pro rata]]'' by level, such that each party member gains a fraction of the enemy's experience points corresponding to the fraction of a party's total level ownership possessed by that character.  For example, after any given battle, a level-30 character in a party would earn twice as much experience as would a level-15 character.  Power-levelers sometimes circumvent this provision by what could be called "passive power-leveling", where a high level character who has access to healing abilities does not formally join the lower-level character's party, instead ''a'') healing and/or "powering up" the lower-level character, ''b'') targeting the enemy with spells or effects that do not involve joining the battle, and/or ''c'') fighting alongside the lower-level character until the enemy is nearly defeated and then pausing the battle (''e.g.'', through use of "calm" or a similar command) and allowing the lower-level character to resume, finish, and claim all the experience points for itself.  

Finally, power-leveling may be rendered more difficult by having very large jumps between experience points required for each subsequent level of experience. It is common practice to have experience needed increasing in a non-linear way relative to experience levels to push players to the next town or land, but it can also reduce the opportunities for power-leveling as a player would be forced to find a different power-leveling technique for every couple of experience levels and move and do that technique.

===Sharing===
Games, that allow several characters participating in a single event (such as battle or quest completion), implement various methods of determining how and when experience gets shared between participants. These methods include: only ''[[Last-hitting_(game_design)|last-hitting]]'' character, whose hit killed the enemy, getting experience (as in ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series); unconditionally sharing experience among characters (as in ''[[D&amp;D|D&amp;D system]]''); and giving experience based on each character's actions (as in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]''). In some online games, it is possible to join a group and gain experience, loot or other rewards, while providing little or no contribution to the group. This type of behaviour is referred to as leeching, particularly when it is done without the permission of other group members. In games which allow players to gain rewards by [[kill stealing]], this is also considered a form of leeching. This is extremely common in games such as ''[[Dungeon Defenders]]'', in which all players receive the same rewards regardless of their contributions.

===Botting===
{{main|computer game bot}}
Some players of online games use automated programs known as [[computer game bot|bots]] to grind or leech for them in order to progress with minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-has-a-botting-problem-1792727078|title=The Elder Scrolls Online Has A Botting Problem|first=Mike|last=Fahey|website=Kotaku.com|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice often violates the terms of service. Bots are also commonly used in commercial operations in order to powerlevel a character, either to increase the sale value of the account, or to allow the character to be used for commercial [[gold farming]].

'''Freeview''' is the New Zealand's [[digital terrestrial television]] platform. It is operated by a [[joint venture]] between the country's major [[free-to-air]] broadcasters – government-owned [[Television New Zealand]] and [[Radio New Zealand]], government-subsidised [[Māori Television]], and the Australian-owned [[MediaWorks New Zealand]] (operators of [[Three (New Zealand)|Three]], [[Bravo (New Zealand)|Bravo]] and [[The Edge TV]]). It consists of a [[high-definition television|HD]]-capable [[digital terrestrial television]] service, to around 86% of the population in the major urban and provincial centres of New Zealand, and a standard-definition [[satellite television]] service, called Freeview Satellite, covering the whole of mainland New Zealand and the major offshore islands. Freeview uses the [[DVB-S]] and [[DVB-T]] standards on government-provided spectrum.

Freeview was launched in May 2007, preparing for [[digital television transition|analogue switch-off]], which began on 30 September 2012 and was completed on 1 December 2013{{ref|ASO|a|a}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Jonathan |last=Coleman |authorlink= Jonathan Coleman (politician) |date= 10 June 2011 |title= Digital switchover dates confirmed – beehive.co.nz |publisher= New Zealand Government }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was estimated that Freeview makes up approximately 61.7% of the television share in New Zealand.

Freeview-certified [[set-top box]]es and [[Integrated Digital Television|IDTVs]], as well as [[Digital video recorder|PVRs]], are available at most major retailers. Uncertified equipment can also be used to receive the service, which may have advantages (cheaper, extra features, international channels) and disadvantages (no/limited EPG, no auto-retuning) over certified equipment.

== History ==
[[File:Freeview NZ logo.svg|thumb|150px|right|Former logo]]

It was announced{{by whom|date=June 2014}} on 15 June 2006 that Freeview's digital terrestrial television would broadcast via satellite ([[DVB-S]]) from mid-2007 and via terrestrial transmissions ([[DVB-T]]) from mid-2008. Freeview's marketing campaign began on 23 April 2007 through a website and through four [[television advertisement]]s shown on Freeview's shareholders' TV channels, using the slogan "Make bad reception a thing of the past", and showing people using proverbial substitutes for [[Television antenna|rabbit ears]] for receiving TV reception. Since 2012, Māori comedian [[Pio Terei]] has been the advertising face of Freeview.

Freeview's satellite service began on 2 May 2007 with five television channels: [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]], [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]], [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]], [[C4 (TV channel)|C4]], and [[Māori Television]]. Freeview's first digital-only channel, [[TVNZ Sport Extra]] temporary channel from [[TVNZ]], began on 18 May 2007, providing coverage of the [[V8 Supercar]] racing. The channel has since ceased broadcasting.

The Freeview terrestrial service, originally named "Freeview&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;HD", officially launched on 14 April 2008. The service initially operated only from [[Kordia]] sites for areas surrounding [[Auckland]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], [[Tauranga]], [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]]-[[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]], [[Palmerston North]], [[Wellington]], [[Christchurch]], and [[Dunedin]].  JDA sites were upgraded later{{by whom|date=June 2014}} with [[DVB-T]] [[QAM (television)|QAM]] modulating multiplexers for non-metro areas.

In October 2014, ''Worldnet TV'' launched the first commercial MHEG-IC channel in New Zealand and was added to JDA regional sites as an MHEG-IC application on LCN 250 which includes seven live streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Worldnet TV channel ready to go over broadband|url=http://www.stoppress.co.nz/blog/2014/03/free-worldnet-tv-channel-ready-go-over-broadband|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freeview Big Winners in Digital Switch Over|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1403/S00391/freeview-big-winners-in-digital-switch-over.htm|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 29 October 2014, live channels include [[NHK World]], [[Arirang TV]], MBC, [[Yonhap]], MBN, HiTV+ and BTN.

===Metadata===
Freeview has its own eight-day [[electronic programme guide]] (EPG), named Freeview EPG; [[TVNZ Teletext|TVNZ's Teletext service]] was also available until it was discontinued in April 2013.&lt;ref name="tvnz"&gt;{{cite web |  year=2006|title=FreeView Digital Broadcasting Information Summarised FAQ| work=Free-To-Air Digital Television – TVNZ  | url=http://digital.tvnz.co.nz/faq.html| accessdate=2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPG via the satellite service provides an eight-day schedule with programme details on both a traditional EIT and MHEG-5 application, whereas the EPG via the terrestrial service has limited programme details via the traditional EIT with full details available only via the MHEG-5 application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EIT EPG on DVB-T| url=http://www.freeviewshop.co.nz/forum/index.php/topic,1243.msg5179.html#msg5179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all ''certified'' NZ Freeview (also all Australian "Freeview EPG" branded) receivers to activate the MHEG-5 EPG, the receiver ''must'' remap the remote control's ''guide'' button to be an extended function key for use by MHEG-5 applications which are normally limited to the four coloured buttons for launching functions.  This is more common on terrestrial than on satellite due to the differences in launch dates.  Receivers that do this make the traditional EIT function useless, which is why independent local broadcasters (such as the Hawke's Bay's TVHB) have to pay Freeview to include their scheduling details within the Freeview guide.   Broadcasters within the UK do not have this problem as they only use the traditional EIT with MHEG-5's use limited to interactive services such as the ''Red Button'' Teletext replacement and internet streaming services.

During the third week of December 2014, TVNZ tested using the same [[Huffman coding|Huffman]] look-up tables the BBC implemented to force viewers to use approved Freeview receivers that [[Freeview (UK)#Copy protection|restrict]] HD recording and viewing.  The Huffman tables are being used to compress the EIT text used for terrestrial schedule event names and descriptions.  From March 2015, TVNZ began compressing the EIT schedule again. Compressing the EIT text in the schedule would not achieve the same receiver use given the terrestrial EIT only has limited programme details.  Receivers that don't use the BBC huffman tables will either display no details or display garbage characters.

===Distribution===
{{As of | 2013}} the Freeview platform has 30 television channels and 4 radio stations.&lt;ref name="channels"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://freeviewnz.tv/media/23078/channel-guide-sep-2012-a.pdf |title= Freeview Channel Guide |date= September 2012 |accessdate= 27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the satellite service ([[Telecommunications link|up-linked]] from the [[Avalon studios]] in Lower Hutt), up to 18 channels will be available, with six each assigned to TVNZ and MediaWorks frequencies, and the balance to other networks.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{Cite video | people=Maharey, Steve |date=2006 | title=Free-To-Air Digital Announcement video  | url=http://digital.tvnz.co.nz/ | medium=Press conference |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that TVNZ's and MediaWorks's current free-to-air channels will be available on Freeview, there will be eight extra channels in total, between the two.

== Defunct channels ==
Services (taken from AsiaSat 3S @ 105 east) that were available before the Freeview launch on satellite were [[Zing (TV channel)|Zing]] channels ZEE TV, Cinema, News and Punjabi, BHARAT TV, [[Al Jazeera]] Arabic and English channels, [[Deutsche Welle|DWTV]], [[TV5Monde|TV5]] and [[VOA]].

The Freeview&amp;#124;HD Demo terrestrial channel 100 was removed to free up space for various SD channels.

The TVNZ Sport Extra channel 20 was temporarily provided for the 2008 Olympics, the space on DVB-S was later used by a regional version of TV One.

The Auckland-based STRATOS channel 21 was discontinued due to service fee increases that occurred when its ratings increased, it was later replaced by ChoiceTV.  STRATOS later reemerged on pay TV under the name [[Face TV]].

TVNZ 6 and 7 were discontinued due to the government-provided funding coming to an end and were respectively, replaced by U and an hour delay of TV One. TVNZ U was replaced by an hour delay of TV2 in 2013.

[[Trackside (New Zealand)|Trackside]] became a pay TV only channel on 14 April 2014 as a measure to raise more revenue for increased services for [[New Zealand Racing Board]] customers.

[[C4 (TV channel)|C4]] closed-down on 26 June 2014 to free space for a time shifted version of FOUR.

The following channels were closed down due to being unable to meet transmission costs:  [[Sommet Sports]] on 12 December 2014, [[Cue TV|Cue]] on 10 April 2015, and tvCentral (Hamilton and Tauranga) and TV Rotorua both on 30 April 2015.

== Other broadcasters ==
Freeview will be open to other free-to-air broadcasters if they want to join.

According to Kordia there is space for approximately only 20 channels on the two satellite transponders that Freeview leases {{as of | 2011 | lc = on}}. However at 22.5 MBd with a FEC of 3/4 one 23&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency can only accommodate either six SD 4:3 H.262 QPSK channels or four HD 16:9 H.264 8PSK channels while maintaining an optimal bit rate.

== Quality ==

Satellite transmissions are broadcast in [[576i]], but the satellite transponder is [[High-definition television|high-definition]] capable.
Terrestrial transmissions can be broadcast in high definition, and the government lets the broadcasters decide whether to broadcast in high definition or to continue in [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]].

Six channels currently broadcast in high definition: TVNZ 1, TVNZ 2, TVNZ DUKE, Three, Maori Television and Te Reo in [[1080i]]''&lt;ref name="fvshd"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.freeviewshop.co.nz/news-i-14.html|title= News |accessdate= 9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.

Freeview satellite broadcasts have declined in quality since the service launched as TV ONE and TV3 are now being broadcast many times to provide region-specific advertisements; this reduces the bandwidth available to other channels on that frequency.''&lt;ref name="picquality"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.freeviewshop.co.nz/forum/index.php/topic,1000.msg4193.html|title= Government refuses to intervene in Freeview satellite picture quality problem  |accessdate= 26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' From July 2016, Mediaworks will deregionalise TV3 so that is uses 1 SD channel alongside its HD channel. 

The TVNZ frequency currently has 8 SD channels while the MediaWorks one has 12 TV channels and 5 radio channels.

== Technology ==

UHF terrestrial broadcasting using DVB-T [[H.264]] (also known as DVB-T HD),&lt;ref name="Digital Terrestrial"&gt;{{cite web | title = Digital Terrestrial | url = http://www.freeviewshop.co.nz/digital-terrestrial-i-8.html | publisher = freeviewshop | year = 2012 | accessdate = 2012-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently covers 86 percent of the country's population. Only three towns with a population over 10,000 do not have terrestrial service: [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] (pop. {{NZ population data|Queenstown|y}}), [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] (pop. {{NZ population data|Blenheim|y}}) and [[Whakatane]] (pop. {{NZ population data|Whakatane|y}}). In addition, [[Oamaru]] (pop. {{NZ population data|Oamaru|y}}) has limited terrestrial service through local station 45 South TV, while coverage of [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]] (pop. {{NZ population data|Cambridge Zone|y}}) is intermittent as hills partially block the signal from Te Aroha transmitter and Hamilton Towers transmitter is not powerful enough (63&amp;nbsp;watts) to reach the town. Freeview's terrestrial transmissions are broadcast from Kordia's and JDA's transmitter towers.

Freeview uses the [[DVB-T]] [[ODFM]] standard for terrestrial transmission, as established in 2001 with NZS6610:2001, to avoid the [[multipath propagation|multipath]] problem caused by New Zealand's rugged topography. [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]], the rival US standard that uses [[8-VSB]] modulation, had a number of first gen. demodulators that couldn't handle multipath well, so it was not chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Transmission Platforms | work=Digital Television Discussion Document 2001 | url=http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentPage____9390.aspx#P126_25725| accessdate=2006-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrestrial Freeview is broadcast in [[H.264]], which unlike [[H.262]] has an expensive transmission [[MPEG-4 AVC#Patent licensing|patent licensing]] tax for free TV and subscription use. People who took part in the Auckland digital trial using terrestrial [[H.262]] receivers needed to change their receivers to more expensive [[H.264]] models in order to receive terrestrial Freeview. DVB-T [[H.264]] is also known in other countries as DVB-T HD, due to [[H.262]] being used for SD. Currently the government owned [[TVNZ]] and [[Kordia]] which operate the [[H.264]] re-compression multiplexers are failing to fully meet the in ''Good Standing'' payments to be included in the licensees listing.  [[MHEG-5]] is used for the electronic programming guide.

MHEG-5 support is built by the UK's Strategy and Technology who provided the similar applications for the BBC's ''Red Button'' and terrestrial internet streaming platform.

Freeview Satellite uses the [[Optus fleet of satellites#Optus D1|Optus D1]] satellite to broadcast, on two [[Transponder#Satellite communications|transponder]]s, leased from Kordia. The satellite transmissions utilise [[H.262]] video. Freeview cannot easily move to [[H.264]] video broadcasting in the future as the encoding is unsupported by a large number of the receivers in the Freeview Satellite install base, also the additional patent licensing tax would make the satellite service even more expensive for channel operators. Unlike the terrestrial service, the satellite service broadcasts a more useful traditional DVB EPG alongside the functionally limited MHEG-5 EPG.

Freeview had discussed with [[Telecom New Zealand|Telecom]] about the provision of [[IPTV]] over [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line|ADSL]] until it was shelved due to bandwidth and availability limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Tom | last=Pullar-Strecker| title=Sky watches broadband move | date=24 July 2006 | publisher=Stuff | url=http://stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3740872a28,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Certification ===
Freeview certifies [[set-top box]]es but does not sell them; they are marketed by electronics retailers.&lt;ref name="video" /&gt; Freeview certification centres the localisation of multimedia data, primarily for the electronic programming guide (EPG).  This data is broadcast over DVB using the [[MHEG-5]] standard. At the moment this is only used to transmit [[Electronic program guide|EPG]] data.

Freeview Record certification of [[digital video recorder]]s is similar to Freeview certification, but also includes dual tuner with smart conflict resolution including alternate recordings of repeat programmes and one touch series recording from the EPG. Full fast forward and rewind cuing is available while an automatic ad skip function is not allowed. For copyrighted HD content, only devices that comply with studio DTCP are allowed to externally transfer content while all SD content is transferrable. There are no time limits on content playback. As of May 2012, there are currently two certified MyFreeview Satellite receivers available, which are from the New Zealand-based Dish TV company.

MHEG-5 is used exclusively for a full 8-day terrestrial broadcast schedule as Freeview do not fully populate the DVB EIT EPG, this means there are few uncertified terrestrial receivers on the market able to run the MHEG-5 Freeview EPG application. An uncertified terrestrial DVR would have to know the specific files to extract from the DSM-CC stream to support a full EPG.

Freeview certification requires [[set-top box]]es to disallow high definition video output over connections that do not support [[HDCP]]. In practice this means nearly all HD [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] televisions sold in New Zealand and many early flat screen televisions can only receive high definition from an uncertified set-top box, which can output high definition over HDCP-free connections like [[component cable]]s or on HDMI without HDCP.

Digital TV Labs is an officially approved test centre for Freeview New Zealand conformance testing, where manufacturers wishing to deploy devices with the associated Freeview  New Zealand logos and access to the Freeview EPG can obtain pass reports.

There are also many non-certified options are available.  These and other FTA receivers have no limit on advert skipping nor restrict access to the recorded files or prevent streaming of recordings to other devices, Ultraplus X-9200HD PVR, Vu+ Duo, Xcruiser XDSR385HD PVR are all examples of units that are or have been sold in NZ and have all of this capability. They can also receive any other available non-freeview channel.

A terrestrial network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://freeviewnz.tv/coverage.aspx |title= Freeview coverage |accessdate= 25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[64-QAM]] and [[256-QAM]] capable transmitters around New Zealand are maintained by both [[Kordia]] and Johnson Dick and Associates (JDA).

Kordia owned sites are on mostly crown-owned [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|DOC]] land providing TV and radio digital services to only Freeview and Igloo, whereas JDA equipped sites are only on commercial land.  Shared sites such as Auckland's Sky Tower have the advantage of not requiring a separate antenna unlike Nelson's Mainland TV which is located between sites. In the Wairarapa and Southland, JDA's Popoiti and Forest Hill transmitters were used rather than Kordia's Otahoua and Hedgehope transmitters which had previously been used for UHF transmitters, necessitating viewers in these regions to rotate their outdoor antennas.

Polarisation (i.e., antenna orientation) is either horizontal/flat (H) or vertical/tall (V). A high-power site has a licensed broadcasting power of 10,000&amp;nbsp;watts or greater; a medium-power site has a licensed broadcasting power of between 500 and 10,000&amp;nbsp;watts; and a low-power site has a licensed broadcasting power of less than 500&amp;nbsp;watts.

High-power sites are [[Waiatarua]] (H) for the [[Auckland]] metropolitan area (including Pukekohe), [[Te Aroha]] (H) for the [[Waikato Region|Waikato]] and parts of [[Tauranga]], Mount Erin (V) for [[Hawke's Bay]], [[Mount Taranaki]] (H) for [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]], Wharite (V) for the [[Manawatu]], [[Mount Kaukau|Kaukau]] for the [[Wellington]] (H) metropolitan area, [[Sugarloaf (Christchurch)|Sugarloaf]] (H) for Christchurch, [[Mount Cargill]] (H) for Dunedin and Forest Hill (V) for [[Invercargill]]. All except the last are operated by Kordia.

Medium-power sites run by Kordia are [[Waiheke Island Aerodrome|Waiheke Island Airstrip]] (V) for [[Waiheke Island]], Kopukairua (V) for [[Tauranga]], Ngarara (V) for [[Kapiti Coast|Kapiti]], and Fitzherbert (V) for [[Lower Hutt]] and [[Wainuiomata]].

Medium-power sites run by JDA are Parihaka (V) for [[Whangarei]], [[Sky Tower (Auckland)|Sky Tower]] (V) for Auckland, Pukepoto (V) for [[Rotorua]], Whakaroa (V) for [[Taupo]], Parikanapa (H) and Wheatstone Road (H) for [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]], Popoiti (H) for the [[Wairarapa]], Mount Campbell (V) and Botanical Ridge (H) for [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], and Cave Hill (V) for [[Timaru]].

Low-power sites run are Pinehill (H) for Auckland's [[North Shore City|North Shore]],&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;While named after the suburb of [[Pinehill, New Zealand|Pinehill]], the transmitter is actually located in the suburb of [[Murrays Bay]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Remuera]] (V) for the Remuera area, Hamilton Towers (V) for Hamilton city, [[Hawke's Bay Airport|Napier Airport]] (V) for northern Napier, Mount Jowett (H) for [[Whanganui]], Baxters Knob (H) for [[Porirua]] and [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]], and [[Haywards]] (V) for the Hutt Valley. All except the last are operated by Kordia.

== Finance ==
Freeview is the second digital TV system attempted by the government. The first, in 2000, cost NZ$6.8 million.

The government will pay up to NZ$25 million and provide free radio spectrum, estimated to be worth up to NZ$10 million during the transition to digital;&lt;ref name="govt"&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=New Zealand Government | date=15 June 2006 | title=Free-to-air digital TV to begin roll-out | url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0606/S00270.htm | accessdate=2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the companies involved will pay the remaining $50 million. [[Canterbury Television|Canterbury TV]] estimates it will need to pay NZ$1 million a year if it joins Freeview.&lt;ref name="alt"&gt;{{cite news  |title = Alt TV changes its tune (yay)  |work = The New Zealand Herald |publisher =  |date = 2 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government claims a NZ$230 million benefit to the economy.&lt;ref name="govt" /&gt;

== Competition ==
[[SKY Network Television|SKY]] had a "free-to-air" package where channels similar to the ones available on Freeview were available for a monthly fee of NZ$18.29, plus an installation fee of NZ$99.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can I temporarily disconnect SKY when I'm away on holiday? |work=Sky TV frequently asked questions |url=http://www.skytv.co.nz/index.cfm?pageid=445&amp;script=faqmodule&amp;faq=grp&amp;gid=9&amp;nrcontent=0&amp;pid=445 |accessdate=2006-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204155923/http://skytv.co.nz/index.cfm?pageid=445&amp;script=faqmodule&amp;faq=grp&amp;gid=9&amp;nrcontent=0&amp;pid=445 |archivedate=4 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 90,000 people use this service, generally those who cannot get a high quality signal from analogue terrestrial television.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite news | first=Claire | last=Trevett| title=18 TV channels and it's all free | date=15 June 2006 | publisher=NZ Herald | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10386824 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SKY has been relatively unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people=Poland, Owen (Reporter)|date=2006 | title=Freeview TV to hit Sky hard  | url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/video_popup_windows_skin/750634 | medium=TV-News | publisher=TV ONE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because both services use Optus D1, a SKY dish can be used to receive Freeview, but a separate set-top box is required.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=TV viewers may need two boxes | date=3 July 2006 | publisher=Stuff | url=http://stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3718577a28,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GammaPhi FullColor.jpg|thumb|right|Gamma Phi Circus logo]]
'''Gamma Phi Circus''', sponsored by [[Illinois State University]], is the oldest collegiate [[circus]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="GPC History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gammaphicircus.illinoisstate.edu/historyheritage/ |title=History and Heritage &amp;#124; Gamma Phi Circus |publisher=Gammaphicircus.illinoisstate.edu |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715070927/http://gammaphicircus.illinoisstate.edu/historyheritage/ |archivedate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as the Gamma Phi [[fraternity]], founded in 1929 by ISU gymnastics instructor Clifford "Pop" Horton.&lt;ref name="GPC History" /&gt; The fraternity's first circus performance took place in 1931. Gamma Phi Circus is a performing arts fraternal organization and is no longer affiliated with social fraternities or sororities and is a registered student organization.&lt;ref name="GPC FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gammaphicircus.illinoisstate.edu/historyheritage/faq.shtml |title=FAQ &amp;#124; History and Heritage &amp;#124; Gamma Phi Circus |publisher=Gammaphicircus.illinoisstate.edu |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301120255/http://gammaphicircus.illinoisstate.edu/historyheritage/faq.shtml |archivedate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Gamma Phi Circus was founded in 1929 by Dr. Clifford Horton, who was a [[gymnastics]] instructor for Illinois State Normal University.&lt;ref name="GPC History" /&gt; The Gamma Phi fraternity was founded in 1929 and held the first Gamma Phi Circus performance in 1932 on the Illinois State University [[campus]]. The [[Bloomington-Normal]] community has had strong ties to circuses since the 1880s, and was home to the Flying Wards and the Conciellos, both trapeze acts. Women always performed in the Circuses and began to be formally initiated into the organization in 1939.&lt;ref name="GPC History" /&gt;

Circus [[alumni]] have gone on to perform in a variety of venues including the Shrine Circuses, the Circus Kingdom, Roberts Brothers Circus, Kelly Brothers Circus, the Great American Circus, and the Circus Alleluia. They have also performed at [[Disney World]], Sea World, [[Busch Gardens]], [[Universal Studios]], [[Great America (disambiguation)|Great America]], and at Club Med Resorts. Members and alumni have also competed several times internationally in the Rhoenradturnen (Wheel Gymnastics) World Championships. In February 2017, five members competed in two acts at the first annual VivaFest, a circus competition in Las Vegas, Nevada. Lyric Hoop and Cyr Wheel received fourth place and Dance Trapeze received fifth. There were 37 acts in Gamma Phi Circus's category.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Financial aspects ==
Gamma Phi Circus is an entirely self-financed organization supported by [[revenue]] from the home performances.&lt;ref name="GPC FAQ" /&gt; "Home Shows" performed at Illinois State University draw visitors to the university. Gamma Phi Circus also offers free exhibitions that publicize the show and the University. Local businesses and corporations help with the cost of the show by sponsoring certain acts and purchasing advertisement space in the program. The circus rents space from the university at full cost, buys or makes the costumes, and does maintenance and buys equipment for the rehearsal areas. Advertising is through TV, radio, newspapers, and brochures.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Shows ==
Gamma Phi Circus performs "Home Shows" as well as exhibitions and road shows.&lt;ref name="GPC FAQ" /&gt; Every April their Home Show at [[Redbird Arena]] usually consists of twenty or more acts and typically draws an audience of over 16,000 fans. Twenty to thirty road shows and exhibitions are also performed each year for schools, businesses, and charities. Gamma Phi Circus' road show performances are approximately two hours long, and are performed in advance of the main Home Show. They perform double-duty as both a full circus performance and a preview and tune-up for the main show. Exhibitions are usually forty-five minutes in length and will normally consist of floor acts only including acrosport, globes, unicycles, gymwheel, chair balancing and juggling and are typically performed for school assemblies and open houses.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

'''Igor Fokin''' (1960 &amp;ndash; September 21, 1996) was a [[Russians|Russian]] [[puppeteer]] and [[busking|street performer]].  He learned his craft in his hometown of [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]].  He moved from the former [[Soviet Union]] to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], in the [[United States]], in 1993.  He was able to bring his wife and son over in 1994, and was also granted a [[Visa (document)|visa]] which allowed him to continue to live and perform in the United States.  He performed puppet shows on summer evenings on street corners in Cambridge.  He used wooden [[marionettes]] set to traditional Russian music.  The marionettes were carved and painted by him, and he also sewed the marionettes' clothing.  In 1996, he performed shows as part of the festivities at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]],  [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  He died early in the morning from [[heart failure]] on September 21, 1996, at the age of 36, just a few hours after returning home from a show in [[Harvard Square]].

Soon after word of his death spread, several fund raisers were held for his family by area street performers and members of the local community.  On September 22, 2001, five years and one day after his death, a sculpture modelled after one of his marionettes was erected in his memory on the street corner in [[Brattle Square]] where he performed.

The '''Imagineering Foundation''' is a charity organisation that encourages school children aged from 8-16 to engage with engineering.

==History==
It was formed in 1999 by a group of [[The Midlands, England|Midlands]] engineers who were concerned about a perceived lowering of interest in engineering activities by schoolchildren, leading to a skills shortage in the [[STEM fields|STEM]] subjects. It was launched as an educational charity on 31 July 2001.

The website was developed in 2004, with educational material for the clubs.

==Structure==
It is based in [[Warwickshire]]. It also has a substantial online presence with a website built so tutors can access project material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Imagineering Foundation|url=https://imagineering.org.uk/about-us/history/|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Function==
===Clubs===
It currently organizes 147 engineering clubs mostly in [[England]], but with two in Wales and five in Scotland. Most of the clubs are in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], and to a lesser extent in the [[East Midlands]] ([[Northamptonshire]]). Each week, around 1800 children take part in the clubs.

It publishes a magazine called ''The Imagineer''.

===Fairs===
It hosts children's engineering fairs at the [[Royal Bath and West Show]], the [[Royal International Air Tattoo]] at [[RAF Fairford]], and the International Air Day at [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)|RNAS Yeovilton]]. These events are often attended by people (parents) already interested in engineering - the organization's target audience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7388">'''Ink wash animation''' (水墨动画, ''shuimo donghua'') is an [[animation]] style that is unique to [[China]]. This style combines both Chinese traditional aesthetics of [[Shui-mo]] and modern animation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "National Style and National Identity: The Rise of Ink-Painting Animation in the Early 1960s," in On the Move: The Trans/national Animated Film in 1940s-1970s China|last = Du|first = Daisy Yan|publisher = University of Wisconsin-Madison|year = May 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It first appeared in the 1961 with the first Chinese ink-wash animation ''Tadpoles Searching for Mother''.&lt;ref name="fading" /&gt; After the 1990s, film studios gradually gave up ink-wash animation production due to the high demand in cost and techniques.&lt;ref name="extinction" /&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Qian Jiajun.gif|150px|thumb|right|Qian Jiajun, one of the most important founders of water-ink painting animation]]
In late 1950s, inspired by China's legendary painter [[Qi Baishi]]'s water-ink painting, Chinese animation industry pioneers began to explore ways to turn Chinese traditional paintings into cartoon form.&lt;ref name="extinction"&gt;[http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/ent3296.html  "Once famous Chinese ink painting animation faces extinction."] Retrieved Jun 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The first ink-wash animation film, ''[[Where is Mama|Tadpoles Searching for Mother]]'', received the Best Animated Film Prize at the First [[Hundred Flowers Awards]], as well as several international prizes.&lt;ref name="fading"&gt;[http://www.ecns.cn/art/2011/06-21/151.shtml "Water-ink animation: a fading Chinese dream."] Retrieved Jun 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, more ink-wash film were produced.

But by the 1990s, animation studios without government funding were urged to produce cheap television series instead of costly ink-wash production. Techniques that had once been identified as state secrets were used to shoot commercial advertising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinesefilms.cn/141/2012/03/21/141s8224.htm "Water-ink Animation's Uncertain Future."] Retrieved Jun 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Feeling from Mountain and Water]]'', produced in 1988, is said to be the last masterpiece of Chinese ink-wash animation film.&lt;ref name="fading" /&gt;

==Major works==

===''Tadpoles Searching for Mother'' (1961)===
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Tadpoles Searching for Mother.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''Tadpoles Searching for Mother'' (1961)]] --&gt;
The film is based on a children's story written by [[Fang Huizhen]] and [[Sheng Lude]]. A group of newly born tadpoles decide to seek for their mother who they've never met before. On the way, they mistake golden fish, crab, tortoise and fish for their mother, and they gather new clues about their mother's appearance through each encounter.

This 14-minute film has been internationally recognized in many film festivals, including the [[Locarno International Film Festival]] in 1961, the 4th [[Annecy International Animation Film Festival]] in 1962, and the 3rd [[Animafest Zagreb|Zagreb World Festival of Animated Films]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="shuimo"&gt;[http://www.idhan.com/media/smdh/smdh.html "水墨动画——中国心灵."] Retrieved June 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the surface, the film appears to be simple. However, each frame required complex techniques and much work in order to present the artistic style of ink-wash painting. The techniques were even regarded as a "state secret".&lt;ref name="artists"&gt;[http://news.mtime.com/2011/08/30/1469021-2.html "正在消亡的水墨动画电影."] Retrieved Jun 12, 014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Cowboy's Flute'' (1963)===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cowboy Flute.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''The Cowboy's Flute'' (1963)]] --&gt;
{{main|The Cowboy's Flute}}
Produced in 1963, this film uses Chinese ink paintings to depict the charming relationship between a young cow herding boy with extraordinary flute playing skills and his faithful water buffalo. The boy falls asleep in a tree, and he dreams that he has lost his buffalo. It turns out that the buffalo is drawn to the beautiful scenery of a waterfall and refuses to return to the herding boy. The boy then plays the flute, and the melody helps bring the buffalo back to him.

There is no dialogue in the film. Story is told through animation and the accompanying music, therefore the film is entirely accessible to a non-Chinese speaking audience. The flute melody was played by China's most famous bamboo flute soloist [[Lu Chunling]].&lt;ref name="shuimo" /&gt; The film was awarded the Golden Prize at the [[Odense International Film Festival|Odense International Fairy Tale Film Festival]] in Denmark. People{{who|date=July 2017}} called ink-wash animation the "fifth Chinese invention".&lt;ref name="fading"/&gt;

===''Feeling from Mountain and Water'' (1988)===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mountain and water 1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''Feeling from Mountain and Water'' (1988)]] --&gt;
Named after [[Shan shui|a phrase for landscape painting]], ''Feeling from Mountain and Water'' became the last water-ink animation. The film tells the simple tale of an impoverished elderly [[zither]] musician and a young boy. The zither musician falls ill on his way back home. The boy kindly takes him to his house and takes care of the musician. To thank the boy, the musician begins to teach the boy zither and becomes his mentor and friend. The film eschews dialogue, yet the animation and music make the film rich in emotion and philosophical ideas.&lt;ref name="shuimo" /&gt;

The 18-minute film is regarded by many as the masterpiece of Chinese ink-wash animation. The musical accompaniment of the film is mainly featured by zither, however, "some of the most moving moments of the film unfold purely through the image to the sound of rushing winds or total silence".&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/culture/2008-06/04/content_11848479_2.htm "Water-and-Ink animation."] Retrieved Jun 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==

===Cultural Revolution===
During the ten-year turmoil of [[Cultural Revolution]], many animation producers were attacked, and the development of animation industry was suspended. ''The Cowboy's Flute'' became the target of criticism because of its representation of pastoral life instead of class struggles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifengweekly.com/display.php?newsId=4312# "钱家骏：水墨动画的拓荒者."] Retrieved Jun 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market economy reform===
When ink-wash animation was first produced in 1960s, China was under the [[planned economy]]. Film studios were owned and supported by the state.&lt;ref name="extinction" /&gt; Fundings were granted to animation production at the standard of 8000RMB per minute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.163.com/dingxiaolin_nj/blog/static/34004922009729523245/ "中国水墨动画路在何方？"] Retrieved Jun 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, artists and technicians in the production teams were able to fully engage in artistic creation and innovation without financial or commercial burdens.

However, starting in the late 1980s, China began its transition into [[market economy]]. State-owned studios lost their government funding, and were urged to produce cheap television series in oder to support themselves. Ink-wash animation production was regarded as "costly" and "unnecessary".&lt;ref name="extinction"/&gt;

'''''Joey and Maria's Comedy Italian Wedding''''' is an interactive [[dinner theater]] presentation in the United States.  Rights to the show are owned by Dillstar Productions of [[Rancho Cucamonga, California]] and is leased by AKA Interactive Entertainment. Presently it is running in [[Anaheim, California]], [[San Diego, California]], [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[Hartford, Connecticut]] and [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. 

The show was written by the husband-and-wife team of Paul and Darlyne Franklin.

Audience members are active participants in the wedding nuptials and subsequent [[wedding reception|reception]], which  take place in a restaurant in [[Boston]]'s North End owned by the bride's cousin and the play's [[master of ceremonies]], Carmine Cannoli.  The wedding, performed by "St. Anthony's" parish [[Roman Catholic priest|priest]] Pastor Fazool, brings together the families of two young lovers, Joseph Anthony Gnocchi and Maria Angelina Cavatelli.  The cast of characters are all, in fact, named after [[Italian cuisine|Italian dishes]].  Chaos ensues during the ceremony with the unexpected arrival of Joey's provocatively dressed ex-girlfriend, Viola Vermicelli.  Viola, it seems, is still in love with Joey.  Despite Joey's roving eye, he's very much in love with Maria and loudly protests Viola's arrival.  After the couple is joined, the cast leaves the room and are reintroduced one at a time by Carmine.  A toast is raised by Joey's scatterbrained [[best man]], Rocco Ravioli.  During the toast, dinner is being served to the guests.  

Upon its completion, the cast moves about the tables, chatting and flirting with the guests.  After dinner, the party itself commences with traditional Italian-American flourishes such as a sing-along and a ''[[tarantella]].''  The traditional bouquet and garter tosses place the guests who catch them in a rather bizarre and extremely funny onstage situation in which the male guest is asked to remove the garter from the leg of the female guest using only his teeth.  The arrival of Maria's [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafioso]] godfather Don Ziti (often played by a selected good-sport audience member) also means the arrival of a large sum of money for the new couple.  The "money" is handed over to Joey's cousin, bridesmaid Louisa Ravioli, for safekeeping.  The money later turns up missing and a male guest is "accused" of stealing it.  He's led out the door and is met by a hail of gunfire... which misses.  Joey &amp; Maria come back dressed in snazzy traveling clothes, ready for one final dance, then off to honeymoon in Vegas and spend some of that wedding dough... "and they all lived happily ever after!"

Very few parts of ''Joey and Maria's Comedy Italian Wedding'' are scripted, with the momentum of the play maintained by ad-libbed [[slapstick]] humor.

The following is a '''list of amusement rides manufactured by the now-defunct [[Arrow Development]] and [[Arrow Dynamics]]'''.

Note that Arrow changed names and ownership four times between 1945 and 2002, operating as Arrow Development from 1945 to 1981, Arrow-Huss from 1981 to 1984, and as Arrow Dynamics from 1986 to 2001. The remaining assets were purchased by S&amp;S on October 28, 2002. In November 2012, Sansei Yusoki Co. Ltd, acquired controlling interest in S&amp;S and renamed itself S&amp;S Sansei Technologies.

&lt;!-- This is a list of existing projects and CONFIRMED future projects. "Confirmed" means the park has issued a press release announcing it (acceptable) or a reliable source (i.e., local newspaper) has published an article mentioning its construction (preferable). This is not a wish-list nor is it a place for speculation and rumor. --&gt;

As of 2018, Arrow Development has built 102 [[roller coaster]]s&lt;!--see ref--&gt; around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rcdb.com/6835.htm Arrow Development - rcdb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''MAC Awards''', established in 1986, are presented annually to honor achievements in [[cabaret]], [[comedy]] and [[jazz]]. They are administered by the non-profit '''Manhattan Association of Cabarets &amp; Clubs''' ('''MAC'''), founded in 1983, and voted on by the MAC membership.&lt;ref name="MAC History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://macnyc.com/about/history/ |title=Manhattan Association of Cabarets &amp; Clubs (MAC): History |website=MACNYC.com |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Awards encompass more than two dozen categories, such as: vocalists and vocal groups, piano bar and jazz performers, comedy and musical performers, writers of songs and special material, directors, musical directors, recordings, and musical revues. In addition, through special awards, MAC salutes outstanding contributions to the field of live entertainment, including Lifetime Achievement Awards. Honorees of the MAC Awards have included [[Liza Minnelli]],&lt;ref name="MAC 1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://macnyc.com/1999-mac-award-winners/ |title=1999 MAC Award Nominees and Winners |website=MACNYC.com|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Manilow]],&lt;ref name="MAC 2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://macnyc.com/2000-mac-award-winners/ |title=2000 MAC Award Nominees and Winners |website=MACNYC.com|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosemary Clooney]],&lt;ref name="MAC 2001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://macnyc.com/2001-mac-award-winners/ |title=2001 MAC Award Nominees and Winners |website=MACNYC.com|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]],&lt;ref name="MAC 2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://macnyc.com/2003-mac-award-winners/ |title=2003 MAC Award Nominees and Winners |website=MACNYC.com|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Manhattan Transfer]],&lt;ref name="MAC 2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://macnyc.com/2004-mac-award-winners/ |title=2004 MAC Award Nominees and Winners |website=MACNYC.com|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keely Smith]],&lt;ref name="MAC 2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://macnyc.com/2005-mac-award-winners/ |title=2005 MAC Award Nominees and Winners |website=MACNYC.com|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Betty Buckley]],&lt;ref name="MAC 2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://macnyc.com/2006-mac-award-winners/ |title=2006 MAC Award Nominees and Winners |website=MACNYC.com|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maureen McGovern]]&lt;ref name="MAC 2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://macnyc.com/2008-mac-award-winners/ |title=2008 MAC Award Nominees and Winners |website=MACNYC.com|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BWW 2008-05"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/2008-MAC-Award-Winners-Announced-20080507 |date=May 7, 2008 |title=2008 MAC Award Winners Announced |website=BroadwayWorld.com |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Polly Bergen]].&lt;ref name="MAC 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://macnyc.com/2009-mac-awards-nominees-winners/ |title=2009 MAC Award Nominees and Winners|website=MACNYC.com|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association==
The Manhattan Association of Cabarets &amp; Clubs (MAC) itself was founded in 1983 as an organization "for cabaret owners, managers, and booking agents to meet and exchange ideas." Its membership was opened to performers in 1985. The Board of Directors began bestowing its MAC Awards in 1986 to those they deemed "had made a contribution to live entertainment, whether a business person, local performer, dedicated critic, or cabaret luminary." Currently, the Awards are voted on by the MAC membership and honor cabaret, comedy, and jazz performers, as well as behind- the-scenes professionals.&lt;ref name="MAC History"/&gt;

Curt Davis was the first president of MAC. After his death he was succeeded by Erv Raible, co-owner of several New York piano bars and cabarets. Other MAC presidents have included Jamie deRoy, Michael Estwanick, Barry Levitt, Judy Barnett, Scott Barbarino and Ricky Ritzel. The Association's current president is Lennie Watts, appointed in 2009.A 501C6 trade organization with a dues-paying membership, MAC differs from a 501C3-designated organization in that contributions to it are not tax deductible. According to the organization's website, "MAC’s mission is to advance the art and business of live entertainment ... its activities are designed to heighten public awareness of the field’s contributions and vitality, to honor its creativity, to build its current and future audiences, and to speak out as an influential voice on behalf of MAC members and the industry at large."&lt;ref name="MAC History"/&gt;

'''''Manhua''''' ({{zh|t=漫畫|s=漫画|p=Mànhuà ''[[Help:IPA for Mandarin|[mân.xwä̂]]]''|j=maan6 waa2}}) are Chinese [[comics]] produced in [[Mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Taiwan]].

==Etymology==
The word "manhua", literally "impromptu sketches", is originally an 18th-century term used in Chinese [[literati painting]]. It became popular in Japan as [[manga]] in the late 18th century. [[Feng Zikai]], in his 1925 series of cartoons entitled ''Zikai Manhua'', reintroduced the term into Chinese in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Petersen |first=Robert S. |title=Comics, Manga, and Graphic Novels: A History of Graphic Narratives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hr7aZh6oonoC&amp;pg=PA120 |year=2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313363306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Politcal Map of 19th Century China（時局全圖）.jpg|thumb|''The Situation in the Far East'', an 1899 manhua by [[Tse Tsan-tai]]]]

[[File:Mr. Wang joins the army.gif|thumb|"Abandon the Civilian Life, Join the Army": [[Ye Qianyu]]'s 1939 Mr. Wang manhua reflects the artist's own life during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]]]]

The oldest surviving examples of Chinese drawings are stone [[relief]]s from the 11th century BC and [[pottery]] from 5000 to 3000 B.C. Other examples include symbolic brush drawings from the [[Ming Dynasty]], a satirical drawing titled "Peacocks" by the early [[Qing Dynasty]] artist [[Zhu Da]], and a work called "Ghosts' Farce Pictures" from around 1771 by Luo Liang-feng. Chinese manhua was born in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, roughly during the years 1867 to 1927.&lt;ref name="Wendy"&gt;Wong, Wendy Siuyi.  [2002] (2001) ''[[Hong Kong Comics: A History of Manhua]]''. [[Princeton Architectural Press]], New York.  {{ISBN|1-56898-269-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of [[lithographic]] printing methods derived from the West was a critical step in expanding the art in the early 20th century. Beginning in the 1870s, satirical drawings appeared in newspapers and periodicals. By the 1920s palm-sized picture books like [[Lianhuanhua]] were popular in [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name="Lent"&gt;Lent, John A. [2001] (2001) Illustrating Asia: Comics, Humor Magazines, and Picture Books. University of Hawaii Press. {{ISBN|0-8248-2471-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered the predecessor of modern-day manhua.

One of the first magazines of satirical cartoons came from the [[United Kingdom]] entitled ''The China Punch''.&lt;ref name="Wendy" /&gt; The first piece drawn by a person of Chinese nationality was ''The Situation in the Far East'' from [[Tse Tsan-tai]] in 1899, printed in Japan. [[Sun Yat-Sen]] established the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1911 using [[Hong Kong Comics|Hong Kong's manhua]] to circulate anti-[[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] propaganda. Some of the manhua that mirrored the early struggles of the transitional political and war periods were ''The True Record'' and ''Renjian Pictorial''.&lt;ref name="Wendy" /&gt;

Up until the establishment of the Shanghai Sketch Society in 1927, all prior works were Lianhuanhua or loose collections of materials. The first successful manhua magazine, ''[[Shanghai Sketch]]'' (or ''Shanghai Manhua'') appeared in 1928.&lt;ref name="Wendy" /&gt; Between 1934 and 1937 about 17 manhua magazines were published in Shanghai. This format would once again be put to propaganda use with the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. By the time the [[Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupied Hong Kong]] in 1941, all manhua activities had stopped. With the surrender of the Japanese in 1945, political mayhem between Chinese [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] took place. One of the critical manhua, ''This Is a Cartoon Era'' by Renjian Huahui made note of the political backdrop at the time.&lt;ref name="Wendy" /&gt;

One of the most popular and enduring comics of this period was [[Zhang Leping]]'s ''[[Sanmao (comics)|Sanmao]]'', first published in 1935.

The rise of Chinese immigration turned Hong Kong into the main manhua-ready market, especially with the [[baby boom]] generation of children. The most influential manhua magazine for adults was the 1956 ''Cartoons World'', which fueled the best-selling [[Uncle Choi]]. The availability of Japanese and Taiwanese comics challenged the local industry, selling at a pirated bargain price of 10 cents.&lt;ref name="Wendy" /&gt; Manhua like ''[[Old Master Q]]'' were needed to revitalize the local industry.

The arrival of television in the 1970s was a changing point. [[Bruce Lee]]'s films dominated the era and his popularity launched a new wave of [[Kung Fu]] manhua.&lt;ref name="Wendy" /&gt; The explicit violence helped sell comic books, and the [[Government of Hong Kong]] intervened with the Indecent Publication Law in 1975.&lt;ref name="Wendy" /&gt; ''[[Oriental Heroes|Little Rascals]]'' was one of the pieces which absorbed all the social changes.
The materials would also bloom in the 90s with work like [[McMug]] and three-part stories like "Teddy Boy", "Portland Street" and "Red Light District".&lt;ref name="Wendy" /&gt;

Since the 1950s, Hong Kong's manhua market has been separate from that of mainland China.

''[[Si loin et si proche]]'', by Chinese writer and illustrator Xiao Bai, won the Gold Award at the 4th [[International Manga Award]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-01-12/xiao-bai-si-loin-et-si-proche-wins-4th-intl-manga-award|title= Xiao Bai's Si loin et si proche Wins 4th Int'l Manga Award|date=2011-01-12|accessdate= 2014-01-14|work= [[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.manga-award.jp/en/index.html|title= The 4th International MANGA Award|accessdate= 2014-01-14|work= manga-award.jp|publisher= International MANGA Award Executive Committee.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other manhua have also won the Silver and Bronze Awards at the International Manga Award.

In the second half of the 2000s and early 2010s, various Chinese cartoonists began using [[social media]] to spread [[satirical]] [[Webcomics|strips and cartoons online]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/16/148695679/provocative-chinese-cartoonists-find-an-outlet-online|website=[[npr.org]]|title=Provocative Chinese Cartoonists Find An Outlet Online|last=Langfitt|first=Frank|date=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Print publishing, being strictly controlled in China, is slowly being traded in for [[microblogging in China|microblogging]] websites such as [[Sina Weibo]] and [[Douban]], where manhua can reach a wide audience while subject to less editorial control.&lt;ref name=tcj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/chinese-web-comics-scarlet-faced-dog-and-bu-er-mia/|publisher=''[[The Comics Journal]]''|title=Chinese Web Comics: Scarlet-Faced Dog and Buermiao|last=Martin|first=R. Orion|date=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite China being a major consumer of comics for decades, the medium has never been taken as "serious works of art". R. Martin of ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' describes the Chinese outlook on comics as "pulpy imitations of [[films]]". Furthermore, China strictly controls the publishing of comics, and as a result, cartoonists faced difficulty reaching a large audience. Many cartoonists in the late 2000s began self-publishing their work on [[social media]] instead of attempting to issue paper editions. Websites such as [[Douban]] (2005) and [[Sina Weibo]] (2009) are popular venues for [[digital comic|web manhua]] and [[webcomics]].&lt;ref name=tcj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/chinese-web-comics-scarlet-faced-dog-and-bu-er-mia/|publisher=''[[The Comics Journal]]''|title=Chinese Web Comics: Scarlet-Faced Dog and Buermiao|last=Martin|first=R. Orion|date=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taipei International Comics and Animation Festival]] celebrated a coming "webcomics era" in 2015. With increased [[smartphone]] usage with a younger generation, [[digital comics|web manhua]], [[webcomics]], and [[webtoons]] are expected to become more popular. With an increasing prevalence of Chinese-language online comic platforms, young artists have more opportunities to publish their work and gain a reputation.&lt;ref name=Taipei&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/02/10/2003611251|publisher=''[[Taipei Times]]''|title='Web comics era' is on display at Taipei show|last1=Chih-chi|first1=Kan|last2=Wei-han|first2=Chen|date=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 2010s, [[manhwa|South Korean webtoons]] and webtoon platforms have become increasingly popular in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201708100023.aspx|work=[[Focus Taiwan]]|title=AR game, webcomics featured at Taipei comics fair|last=Chen|first=Christie|date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, two manhua have been adapted into [[anime]] television series: ''[[Yi Ren Zhi Xia]]'' and ''[[Soul Buster]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-06-09/chinese-japanese-anime-hitori-no-shita-the-outcast-announced/.103039|title= Chinese/Japanese Anime Hitori no Shita the outcast Announced|date= June 9, 2016|accessdate= August 17, 2016|work= [[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-08-03/studio-pierrot-unveils-soul-buster-chinese-co-production-anime-for-october/.104964|title= Studio Pierrot Unveils Soul Buster Chinese Co-Production Anime for October|date= August 3, 2016|accessdate= August 7, 2016|work= [[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another series, ''[[Bloodivores]]'', based on a web manhua, will start airing on October 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-09-01/chinese-japanese-anime-bloodivores-announced-for-october/.105972|title= Chinese/Japanese Anime Bloodivores Announced for October|date= September 1, 2016|accessdate= September 25, 2016|work= [[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another series, ''The Silver Guardian'', is scheduled to premiere in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-03-16/the-silver-guardian-anime-reveals-story-staff-2017-airing/.99847|title= The Silver Guardian Anime Reveals Story, Staff, 2017 Airing|date= March 16, 2016|accessdate= September 25, 2016|work= [[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In 1925, the political work of [[Feng Zikai]] published a collection entitled ''Zi-Kai Manhua'' in ''Wenxue Zhoubao'' (Literature Weekly).&lt;ref name="Lent" /&gt; While the term ''"manhua"'' had existed before when borrowed from Japanese ''"[[manga]]"'', this particular publication took precedence over the many other description of cartoon arts that came before it.&lt;ref name="Wendy" /&gt; As a result, the term manhua became associated with Chinese comic materials. The [[Chinese character]]s for manhua are identical for those used in Japanese manga and [[Korea]]n [[manhwa]]. Someone who draws or writes manhua is referred to as a ''manhuajia'' ({{zh|t=漫畫家|s=漫画家|p=mànhuàjiā}}).

==Categories==
Before the official terminology was established, the art form was known by several names.&lt;ref name="Wendy" /&gt;

Today's manhua are simply distinguished by four categories.

==Characteristics==
Modern Chinese-style manhua characteristics is credited to the breakthrough art work of the 1982 ''[[Chinese Hero: Tales of the Blood Sword|Chinese Hero]]''.&lt;ref name="Wendy" /&gt; It had innovative, realistic drawings with details resembling real people. Most manhua work from the 1800s to the 1930s contained characters that appeared serious. The cultural openness in Hong Kong brought the translation of American [[Disney]] characters like [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Pinocchio]] in the 1950s, demonstrating western influence in local work like ''Little Angeli'' in 1954. The influx of translated Japanese manga of the 60s, as well as televised [[anime]] in Hong Kong also made a significant impression. Unlike manga, manhua comes in full color with some panels rendered entirely in painting for the single issue format.

==Differences in formatting==
Depending on the region where it's created, manhua can have differences in the way it is formatted and presented. Besides the use of traditional and simplified Chinese characters, manhua can also be read differently depending on where it's from. Manhua from mainland China is read from left-to-right like Western comics and Korean manhwa while manhua from Taiwan and Hong Kong is read from right-to-left like Japanese manga. The same applies to the text in its original Chinese. Text in manhua from mainland China is placed horizontally and read from left-to-right while in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the text is placed vertically going down and is read from right-to-left. This is due to the changes that the Chinese communist government made to the way Chinese text is written and read to bring it more align to the way it's done in the West. Since Taiwan and Hong Kong have some autonomy from the Chinese government, they have stuck to their traditional ways of formatting and writing.

==Digital manhua==

===Web manhua===
Online manhua, known as [[digital comic|web manhua]], are a growing art form in China, where traditionally published manhua are in decline. Web manhua are posted on social media and web manhua portals, which serve as a lower bar of entry than the strictly controlled print publication outlets in the country. Though little money is currently made through online manhua in China, the medium has become popular due to ease of uploading and publishing titles, color publication, and free reading access. Some popular web manhua sites include QQ Comic and U17. In recent years, several Chinese web manhua have been adapted into animated series, with some in co-production with the Japanese animation industry.

===Webcomics===
As [[microblogging in China|microblogging]] and [[webcomics]] were gaining popularity in China, the form was increasingly used for political activism and [[satire]]. Despite China being a major consumer of comics for decades, the medium has never been taken as "serious works of art". R. Martin of ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' describes the Chinese outlook on comics as "pulpy imitations of [[films]]". Furthermore, China strictly controls the publishing of comics, and as a result, cartoonists faced difficulty reaching a large audience. Many cartoonists in the late 2000s began self-publishing their work on [[social media]] instead of attempting to issue paper editions. Websites such as [[Douban]] (2005) and [[Sina Weibo]] (2009) are popular venues for webcomics.&lt;ref name=tcj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/chinese-web-comics-scarlet-faced-dog-and-bu-er-mia/|publisher=''[[The Comics Journal]]''|title=Chinese Web Comics: Scarlet-Faced Dog and Buermiao|last=Martin|first=R. Orion|date=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; he [[Taipei International Comics and Animation Festival]] celebrated a coming "webcomics era" in 2015. With increased [[smartphone]] usage with a younger generation, webcomics featuring a scrollable [[infinite canvas]] are expected to become more popular. With an increasing prevalence of Chinese-language webcomic portals, young artists have more opportunities to publish their work and gain a reputation.&lt;ref name=Taipei&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/02/10/2003611251|publisher=''[[Taipei Times]]''|title='Web comics era' is on display at Taipei show|last1=Chih-chi|first1=Kan|last2=Wei-han|first2=Chen|date=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 2010s, [[Webtoon|South Korean webcomics]] and webtoon platforms have become increasingly popular in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201708100023.aspx|work=[[Focus Taiwan]]|title=AR game, webcomics featured at Taipei comics fair|last=Chen|first=Christie|date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartoonists such as [[Kuang Biao]] and [[Rebel Pepper]] make use of the Internet to criticize the [[Communist Party]] and its leaders. Communist [[propaganda]] and figures such as [[Lei Feng]] are openly mocked on microblogs and in online cartoons, despite efforts of censorship by the Chinese government. David Bandurski, a researcher with the [[University of Hong Kong]]'s [[China Media Project]], stated that social media has "dramatically changed the environment for cartoonists [as] they now have a really good platform to find an audience." Chinese animator [[Pi San]] criticized internet companies and web portals for being "pretty cowardly" and "too sensitive", as they take on the role of first line of defense through self-censorship. Rebel Pepper's account on Sina Weibo, where he posts his satiral cartoons, had been deleted over 180 times by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/16/148695679/provocative-chinese-cartoonists-find-an-outlet-online|website=[[npr.org]]|title=Provocative Chinese Cartoonists Find An Outlet Online|last=Langfitt|first=Frank|date=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blogging websites such as Sina Weibo are also highly censored by the Chinese government. [[Reuters]] reported in September 2013 that about 150 graduates, all male, were employed to censor Sina Weibo day and night, and automatic censors processed around three million posts per day. A research team from [[Rice University]], Texas, stated that they saw "a fairly sophisticated system, where human power is amplified by computer automation, capable of removing sensitive posts within minutes."&lt;ref name=scmp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1355746/drawing-ire|publisher=''[[South China Morning Post]]''|title=Drawing Ire|date=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images censored from Sina Weibo include a portrait of [[Mao Zedong]] wearing a [[pollution mask]], a photo compilation identifying the expensive watches on the wrists of supposedly low-waged local officials, and criticism on police action, censorship in education, and the [[one child policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/kevintang/online-comics-censored-in-china|publisher=''[[Buzzfeed]]''|title=14 Online Comics Censored In China|last=Tang|first=Kevin|date=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Webtoons===
[[Webtoons]] have grown in popularity in China as another form to consume and produce manhua in the country thanks in part to the popularity of [[manhwa|South Korean webtoons]]. Microblogging platforms Sina Weibo and Tencent have also offered webtoons on their digital manhua sites alongside web manhua. Also Beijing-based platform Kuaikan Manhua specialises in artwork targeting young readers. Several of these manhuas have later been translated into various languages. While webtoon portals in mainland China are mainly run by the big internet companies, webtoon portals in Taiwan are offered and operated by big webtoon publishers outside the country like Comico, and Naver (under the Line brand).

==Economics==
[[Chinese Animation and Comic Publisher Association]] secretary-general [[Roger Kao]] stated in 2015 that comic book sales were strongly in decline. The [[Taiwan]]ese comics industry expects webcomics to prosper financially, though no accurate figures exist as of yet. Prize-winning cartoonists such as [[Chung Yun-de]] and [[Yeh Yu-tung]] were forced to turn to webcomics as their monthly income was too low to live from.&lt;ref name=Taipei /&gt;

[[Beijing]] cartoonist [[Bu Er Miao]] sells her webcomic ''Electric Cat and Lightning Dog'' on Douban's [[eBook]] service for 1.99 [[CNY]] (roughly 0.30 [[USD]]). When asked about whether she makes a profit off of her webcomic, Miao described the 1.79 CNY she makes per comic sold as "an amount of money that if you saw it on the street, no one would bother to pick it up."&lt;ref name=tcj /&gt; Political cartoonist Liu "Big Corpse Brother" Jun had over 130,000 followers on Sina Weibo in December 2013, and Kuang Biao has his work appear both online and in various print journals.&lt;ref name=scmp /&gt;

==Adaptations==
The Chinese webcomic ''[[One Hundred Thousand Bad Jokes]]'' received a [[film adaptation]] [[One Hundred Thousand Bad Jokes (film)|of the same name]] released in 2014.

{{Life in Sri Lanka}}

'''Media of [[Sri Lanka]]''' consist of several different types of communications media: [[television]], [[radio]], [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], and [[Web sites]]. State and private media operators provide services in the main languages [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[English language|English]]. The government owns two major TV stations, radio networks operated by the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC), and newspaper titles in Sinhala, Tamil, and English.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/country_profiles/1168427.stm | work=BBC News | title=Country profile: Sri Lanka | date=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the growth of Sri Lankan economy, many satellite TV channels were introduced.

However, there are over a dozen privately owned radio stations and more than 30 privately operated television stations.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; They often engage in political debates.

The use of the internet is a growing force within Sri Lanka, many of the newspapers now have online editions.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;  Because of the limited circulation for the daily and weekly newspapers, they are heavily dependent on advertising. As a result of this it is very rare to see Sri Lankan newspapers engage in investigative journalism or daring exposés of big business.

==Press freedom==
{{Main|Freedom of the press in Sri Lanka}}
Press freedom is a major concern in Sri Lanka. Both sides in the war make efforts to silence inconvenient reporters. Around 15 reporters received death threats from one faction or the other in 2004&lt;ref&gt;. 
{{cite web |url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=13442 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030154040/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=13442 |archivedate=2007-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The assassinated reporter [[Aiyathurai Nadesan]], correspondent in Batticaloa for several Tamil media stated just prior to his assassination in 2005:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We are caught between a rock and a hard place. It is very difficult for us to check reports either with the security forces or the Tamil Tigers. And when a news item on local events is datelined Colombo, it puts us at risk of reprisals on the ground.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2005, the Tamil newspaper [[Thinakkural]] was threatened   by [[Karuna Amman|Karuna]]. Copies of the newspaper were burned in the Eastern provinces.&lt;ref name="rsf.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=13442 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030154040/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=13442 |archivedate=2007-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, distribution of  the Tamil weekly [[Thinamurasu]]  is blocked by the LTTE because it  is close to another armed group, the [[EPDP]].&lt;ref name="rsf.org"/&gt;

[[BBC World Service]] stopped its broadcast in Sinhalese and Tamil for fear of reprisal against its reporters.&lt;ref name="rsf.org"/&gt;

During the [[Rajapaksa]] administration, press freedom in Sri Lanka became the "worst in any democratic country",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7702880.stm | work=BBC News | title='Drop' in S Lanka press freedom | date=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Reporters without borders]] index, ranking 165th among 173 countries in the index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=19391 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610065257/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=19391 |archivedate=2009-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On 21 November 2008, a twelve-member group of masked men, forcibly entered the printing press of Sunday Leader, Morning Leader and Irudina Sinhala weekly and set fire damaging printing machines and copies of newspapers printed ready for distribution. 
The state jammed transmission of BBC programs which contained content the government disliked.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2008/12/081212_rsf_bbc.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
The main private TV network [[Sirasa]] was repeatedly threatened by minister [[Mervyn Silva]], attacked by a petrol bomb on 2.1.2009 and raided by gunmen on 6.1.2009, who set on fire the main control room.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7813043.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gunmen raid Sri Lanka TV station | date=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in response to [[state media|SLBC]] criticizing Sirasa's coverage of the [[Battle of Kilinochchi (2008–2009)|capture of Kilinochchi]].

According to the head of the company, [[Chevaan Daniel]]: "It's either that the citizens of Sri Lanka are able to drive around attacking institutions armed with weapons and grenades, or there is a hand behind it."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Lasantha Wickrematunge]], the chief editor of the English Weekly [[Sunday Leader]] and Sri Lanka's most influential journalist, was assassinated on the Thursday January 8, 2009 by unknown gunmen. The newspaper and its editor as well as the editor of Morning Leader have been harassed and threatened continuously during the preceding three years. All Leader publications are very critical towards the government and exponents of opposition political views.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2009/01/090108_lasantha.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; According to Reporters without Borders, the Rajapaksa administration blocks investigations into the murder of journalists.&lt;ref name="rsf.org"/&gt;

Defence minister Gotabhaya Rajapaksa threatened to chase Chris Morris, a  BBC journalists, out of the country, if he does not act responsibly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.island.lk/2009/02/01/news1.html | title=The Island-News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local reporters in the country continue to be threatened, as was the case with 54-year-old M.I. Rahmathulla, who was beaten in April 2009 for reporting on political corruption in the Batticaloa region of Sri Lanka's Eastern Province.&lt;ref&gt;Risking Lives for Information Exchange Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting {{cite web |url=http://pulitzercenter.typepad.com/untold_stories/2009/04/sri-lanka-risking-lives-for-information-exchange.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515133852/http://pulitzercenter.typepad.com/untold_stories/2009/04/sri-lanka-risking-lives-for-information-exchange.html |archivedate=2009-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Print media==
{{main|Print media in Sri Lanka}}

===Newspapers===
{{Main|List of newspapers in Sri Lanka}}
Important English language newspapers are the [[Sunday Leader]] ''Daily FT'', ''[[Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)|Daily Mirror]]'', the ''[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|Daily News]]'', ''[[Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka)|Sunday Observer]]'' and ''[[The Island (Sri Lanka)|The Island]]''. Sinhalese newspapers are ''[[Dinamina]]'', ''[[Lankadeepa]]'', ''[[Lakbima]]'', and ''[[Divaena]]''. Tamil newspapers are ''[[Uthayan]]'', '[[Tamil Mirror]]'' ''[[Thinakaran]]'', ''[[Thinakkural]]'', ''[[Sudar Oli]]'', ''[[Thinathanthi]]'', ''Metro'' and ''[[Virakesari]]''.

===Magazines and other periodicals===

==Broadcasting==

===Radio===
{{main|Radio in Sri Lanka}}

Radio broadcasting in [[Sri Lanka]] dates back to 1923. Radio broadcasting, like other forms of media in the country, is generally divided along linguistic lines with state and private media operators providing services in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[English language|English]] language.

===Television===
{{main|Television in Sri Lanka}}

The first [[Television network]] of [[Sri Lanka]] was launched on 13 April 1979. The [[ITN channel]], owned by the [[Independent Television Network Limited]] (ITN) became the first terrestrial television channel of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="itn1"&gt;''ITN Sri Lanka'', [http://www.itn.lk/about.html About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227013549/http://www.itn.lk/about.html |date=2009-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 5, 1979 ITN  was converted to a government owned business&lt;ref name="itn1"/&gt; and was later brought under the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Act of 1982 along with the newly created [[Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation]] (SLRC).&lt;ref name="pr1"&gt;''Press reference'', [http://www.pressreference.com/Sa-Sw/Sri-Lanka.html SRI LANKA Press, Media, TV, Radio, Newspapers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant changes occurred in 1992 as the government permitted the establishment of private television networks.&lt;ref name="pr1"/&gt; Subsequently, the Maharaja Television Network (MTV) was launched in collaboration with [[Singapore Telecommunications Limited]] (SingTel).

Since then many new television networks have come into existence within Sri Lanka. There are also a number of Satellite networks and pay per view television networks in Sri Lanka such as [[Dialog TV]] which boasts over 500,000 subscribers in the country. The national telecommunications provider [[Sri Lanka Telecom]] also launched an [[IPTV]] service in 2008.

==Film==
{{main|Cinema of Sri Lanka}}

Sri Lankan cinema is a fledgling industry that has struggled to find a footing since its inauguration in 1947. Sri Lankan films are usually made in the Sinhalese language, the language of the majority Sinhala people.

In the first nine years most films were made in South India and followed the conventions of Indian cinema. Studio shooting was the norm, with Indian style sets erected in film studios. Even though it is popularly held that ''[[Rekava]]'', made in 1956 by pioneer director [[Lester James Peries]], was the first Sinhala film to be shot completely out of studio, it was really the film "Gambada Sundari", made in 1950 which was the first film shot outside studios. It was also the first Sri Lankan film where, like in "Rekawa", the dialog was recorded on the spot. This was because the film was shot on 16mm, using an Auricon sound-on-film camera which recorded the sound on the 16mm film optically, unlike in the case of where the sound was recorded on a [[Sound follower#Models|Kinevox 35mm magnetic recorder]]. The film was later 'blown-up' to 35mm and was screened in Colombo in 1950.

Though "Rekawa" was acclaimed by local and international critics, the film failed to find an audience in the country and was a box office failure. Films continued to follow formulaic storylines borrowed from [[India]] up through the early 60s despite such efforts as ''[[Sandesaya]]'' and ''[[Kurulu Bedda]]''.

Artists such as [[Tissa Abeysekara]], Dr. D.B.Nihalsingha, [[Prasanna Vithanage]] and [[Vimukthi Jayasundara]] have attempted to breathe new life into the industry. Nihalsingha was an accomplished cinematographer as well as an editor: so his films has an input which was special and brought a viewpoint to all his films, most of which focused on the exploited women.

Vithanage's film ''[[Purahanda Kaluwara]]'' is widely considered one of the best movies made in Sri Lanka as is Jayasundara's ''[[Sulanga Enu Pinisa]]'' which won the coveted ''Camera d'Or'' for best first film at the 2005 [[Cannes Film Festival]].

In recent years, films have begun to tackle gritty subjects such as family relationships, abortion and results of the conflict between the military and [[Tamil Tiger]] rebels in the north. Director [[Asoka Handagama]] especially has drawn criticism for pursuing such material in his work.

==Internet==
{{main|Internet in Sri Lanka}}

Numerous websites covering a wide range of topics, in addition to news and current affairs, exists. While all major newspaper have a web presence, many Sri Lankans turn to independent web publishers for their digital media needs.

'''''Nickelodeon Robot Wars''''' is a game show that aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from August 25, 2002 to October 6, 2002. Hosted by [[Dave Aizer]], the show was Nickelodeon's take on ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'', the popular and long-running robot-fighting game show. The show was canceled after one season, and subsequently aired on [[Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids|Nickelodeon GAS]].

The series of six shows was filmed at [[Shepperton Studios]] in England in January 2002 at the same time as the second season of the ''Robot Wars: Extreme Warriors'' series shown on The New TNN American television network (now [[Spike (TV network)|Spike]]). Both shows featured American teams and robots flown to England for the filming.

==Tournaments==

Seven different tournaments took place over the six show series. Most of the tournaments aired within a single show, but a few spread out over multiple shows.

==Adjustments and changes==
The show featured robot competitors familiar to fans of the American series of Robot Wars, such as 'Rosie The Riveter' and 'The Revolutionist,' but the robot operators were all children associated with the teams.

To suit the younger audience, a few adjustments and changes were made to the arena and House Robots.
* All flame hazards, including the flame pit, fire jets and Sgt Bash's flamethrower, were disabled.
* Sir Killalot was renamed "Sir K," a name he was commonly referred to in the official UK Robot Wars magazine.
* The Pit Release Bumper was moved further down the arena wall, closer to the bottom-right CPZ.
* The language used was changed, with rougher language being disallowed.

'''Nélida Roca''' ({{IPA-es|ˈneliða ˈroka}}; May 30, 1929{{spaced ndash}}December 4, 1999), was one of the first showbusiness [[diva]]s and [[sex symbol]]s of [[Argentina]]. She was an actress, dancer, singer, model and theater [[Vedette (entertainer)|supervedette]].

Born '''Nélida Mercedes Musso''' in [[Buenos Aires]], her friends and colleagues fondly called her ''La Roca'' ("The Rock"). From [[childhood]], she sought to become a famous artist, but had to confront her parents' strong opposition to the idea. Her mother was from the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] region of [[Spain]], and her father was an [[Italian Argentine|Italian]] man from [[Genoa]].
 
Nélida married Julio Rivera Roca, a jazz piano player, in 1949, which got her to complete her dream as the lead vocalist in his orchestra. She was discovered in 1950, during one such performance, by [[Luis César Amadori]], owner of the Maipó Theatre, and first starred on the professional stage in Amadori's ''The Maipó Theatre is Telling its Stories''. The show's commercial success allowed Amadori to triple the price of the seats, and she became a legend in her genre during the 1950s. Critics and her public came to know her as "The Venus of [[Corrientes Avenue]]" (the Buenos Aires [[Argentine culture#Cinema and theatre|theatre]] district).

She remarried in 1963 with vocalist Aldo Perricone (known by his stage name, Ricky Giuliano), though the marriage ended in 1969. In her last show, in the winter of 1974, she shared top credits with the then up-and-coming star, [[Susana Giménez]]. The show, ''The Golden Revue'', her last performance, dealt with cultural changes in Argentina over the years.

==Death==
She died of a heart attack in December 1999, at age 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exitoina.com/2010-08-24-20546-adabel-guerrero-rindio-tributo-a-nelida-roca/|title=Adabel Guerrero rindió tributo a Nélida Roca|work=revista Caras|date=24 August 2010|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''praetexta''''' or '''''fabula praetexta''''' was a genre of Latin [[tragedy]] introduced at Rome by [[Gnaeus Naevius]] in the third century B.C. It dealt with historical Roman figures, in place of the conventional [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]]. Subsequent writers of ''praetextae'' included [[Ennius]], [[Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]]. The name refers to the ''toga praetexta'', the official dress of Roman magistrates.

All [[Roman Republic]]an tragedies are now lost. From the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]] only one play has survived, the [[Octavia (play)|''Octavia'']].

'''Primero''' (in English also called Primus, ''{{lang|fr|Prime}}'', or in Italian ''{{lang|it|Primiera}} or Spanish ''Primera'')'', is a 16th-century gambling [[card game]] of which the earliest reference dates back to 1526. Primero is closely related to the game of [[primo visto]] (a.k.a. prima-vista, and various other spellings), if not the same.

The gambling game with this name goes back to the 16th century, being known to [[Gerolamo Cardano]] as ''{{lang|it|primiera}}'', which he thought of as the noblest of all card games, to [[François Rabelais]] as ''{{lang|fr|prime}}'', and to [[Shakespeare]] as primero.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Card Games'', pg. 226 – {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origins of primero ==

It still seems uncertain whether the game of primero is of Spanish or Italian origin. Although [[Daines Barrington]] is of the opinion that it is of Spanish origin, a poem of [[Francesco Berni]] is the earliest known writing to mention the game; it affords proof that it was at least commonly played in Italy at the beginning of the 16th century. His work entitled ''Capitolo del Gioco della Primiera'', published in Rome in 1526, and believed to be the earliest extant work describing a card game, contains some particulars on primero.&lt;ref&gt;''Researches into the History of Playing Cards and Printing'', by [[Samuel Weller Singer]]; London: Bensley &amp; Son, 1816; pg. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David Parlett]], the game's card-point system is found in other Italian games but nowhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parlett|first1=David|title=The Oxford Guide to Card Games|date=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=91-92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is still very much played in central Europe and Spain with Italian-suited cards, under the name of ''goffo'' or ''bambara'',&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Card Games'', [[David Parlett]]; {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}; p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; remaining the major native vying game of Italy. [[Alessandro Striggio]]'s  [[madrigal]] dramatizing a party of the game "II gioco di primiera" was published in 1569.

== Etymology ==

This old game of cards was called ''{{lang|fr|prime}}'' in France, ''{{lang|es|primera}}'' in Spain, and ''{{lang|it|primiera}}'' in Italy. All names derived from the Latin ''{{lang|la|primarius}}'', 'first'. In English literature, besides the occasional use of the foreign names, the game is designated primero (and also prima-vista, a probable variant), with the usual corruptions in spelling of the early days.

According to [[Stephen Skinner (lexicographer)|Stephen Skinner]], primero and prima-vista are one and the same game.&lt;ref&gt;''Etymologicon Linguae Anglicanae'', Stephen Skinner, 1671. Quote (in Latin): "''{{lang|la|ab Ital. Primiera, Luxus qu dam chartarum, ab Ital. Primiero, Primus, &amp; Prima-vista. Primus aspectus}}''".&lt;/ref&gt; As for John Minshew, primero and prima-vista (''{{lang|la|Primum et primum visum}}'', that is, first and first seen, because he that can show such an order of cards, wins the game), are two different games of cards.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Minsheu]]'s 1617 ''Ductor in Linguas'' (''Guide into Tongues'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Whichever opinion these two seventeenth-century [[lexicographer]]s might have had on the origin of primero, it seems fairly plausible that the game being played in different parts of Europe had to acquire similar names as it migrated from one country to another, or from one region to the other, notably in Italy and Spain. And with the addition of new rules to the original set of rules, or even variations on the rules that the game devised, it finally reached a level of development that made them become separate games, despite their common origin. So, as the Italian writer Berni said: "The game is played differently in different places."

== The gamblers ==
[[file:Primero.jpg|right|thumb|''Four Gentlemen of High Rank Playing Primero'', now attributed to the Master of the Countess of Warwick or his circle.]]
[[Daines Barrington]],&lt;ref&gt;(1677) ''Archaeologia'', v. III, pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt; described an Elizabethan card party painted by [[Federico Zuccari]], and that originally belonged to [[Lord Falkland]], in which [[Lord Burleigh]] is represented playing at cards with three other persons, apparently of distinction, each having two rings on the same fingers of both their hands. The cards used are marked as at present, although they differ from those of modern times for being narrower and longer. Eight of the cards lie on the table with the blank side uppermost, for the cards at that time had blank backs, while four remain in each of the other players hands. A particular in this painting is that one of the players is seen showing his cards, which are: the jack (knave) of hearts, the ace, 7 and 6 of clubs. The cover of the pack lying on the table displays two lions [[Heraldic supporter|supporting]] a shield, upon which is what appears to be a [[heraldic rose]] (the crest of the Tudors), and underneath, though indistinctly, the partially illegible name of a French card-maker Jehan Licl**rer. This particular shows that the cards then used were at least sometimes obtained from France. The money on the table, together with considerable heaps of gold and silver, appears to be coins of Edward VI and Queen Elizabeth I.

As the first [[Marquess of Exeter]], Lord Burleigh, is said to have entirely devoted his time to business and study, taking no diversion but that afforded by his gardens, of which he was both fond and proud, it is to be supposed that this painting was not actually a portrait of him, though mistaken for his, as was the ownership of the old manor-house of Wimbledon.&lt;ref&gt;''Sharpe's London Magazine'' by Princeton University, Vol. 13–14, pg. 169 London, 1846-47&lt;/ref&gt; So, there seems to be little doubt here as for which game the artist meant to describe, and that the person exhibiting his cards to the spectators had won a lush, for his three clubs are the best cards for counting.

A passage in an old play by [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]] has been quoted by several writers as evidence that primero was a gambling game.&lt;ref&gt;"Primero, why I though[t] thou hadst not been so much gamester as play at it" - Greene's: (1611) ''Tu Quoque''&lt;/ref&gt; But a person who objects to cards, might make such a remark with respect to any card game, whether a gambling game or not. Judging from the partial descriptions of the game which remain to us, it might seem that primero was played for either large or small stakes, as agreed upon. [[John Florio]] describes primero played by two persons for "one shilling stake and three rest (pool)."&lt;ref&gt;Florio's ''Second Frutes'' (1591)&lt;/ref&gt; In Minsheu's "Spanish Dialogues",  four play; the stake is two shillings and the rest, eight.&lt;ref&gt;''Once a Week'', vol. 10; Eneas Sweetland Dallas; London: Bradbury and Evans, 1863; p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; The text is self-explanatory, explaining also the meaning of the name primero.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Minsheu]], ''Spanish Dialogues'' (long title: ''Pleasant and Delightful Dialgues in Spanish and English''); London: John Haviland, 1623; p. 26.  Quote: "I take it that it is called ''primero'', because it hath the first place at the play at cardes."  See any online copy for the full dialogue of the gamers as they play, e.g. [http://jducoeur.org/game-hist/primero-dialogue.html this excerpt] of the passage in question.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primero and the Tudor dynasty ==

Primero appears to have been one of the earliest card games played in England during the Renaissance and the [[Tudor dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;''A glossary: or, Collection of words, phrases, names, etc.'' v. II pg. 687, Robert Nares, London (1859)&lt;/ref&gt; and certainly it continued to be one of the most fashionable games throughout the reigns of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], [[Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England]], [[Elizabeth I]] and [[James I of England|James I]], due to the frequent mention of it by many writers of that time. Already during the reign of Henry VII, notices of money issued several times for the King's losses at cards appear in the Remembrance's Office, dated December the 26th, in the ninth year of his reign. There, an entry is made of one hundred shillings paid at one time to him for the purpose of playing at cards. The private expenses of Princess Mary, Henry VIII's daughter and later Queen, also contain numerous items of money "for the playe at cardes". But despite the records, it is not certain that primero found its way to England previously to the marriage of Queen Mary I with [[Philip II of Spain]], although there is no doubt that his coming to England from the court of Charles V would have cause it to be more generally known and played. [[William Shakespeare]] also speaks of Henry VIII playing at primero with his brother-in-law [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], and makes [[Falstaff]] say: "I never prospered since I forswore myself at primero." Additionally, the clown Lancelot in Shakespeare's ''The Merchant of Venice'' confides in this father that "for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have sun some ground" (2.2.91-92). To "set up [one's] rest" alludes to a type of gamble in the Italian version of primero {{see below|lc=y|short=y}}.  Among the epigrams of [[John Harington (writer)|John Harington]] we have one which describes "The Story of Marcus' Life at Primero",&lt;ref&gt;"The Story of Marcus' Life at Primero", in ''Old English Plays'', Fourth Ed., Vol. IX; ed. W. Carew Hazlitt; London: Reeves and Turner; 1874 (reprint of 1744 original publications by Robert Dodsley).&lt;br /&gt;
{{quote|1=&lt;poem&gt;Fond Marcus ever at Primero playes,
Long winter nights, and as long Summer dayes:
And I heard once, to idle talke attending;
The Story of his times, and coines mis-spending.
...&lt;/poem&gt;

== Evolution and decline ==

Judging by the pattern of succession of games during the Renaissance, it is to be noted that many of the card games played throughout Europe, ascended in popularity to be later replaced by another type of game, again brought into England by the court gamester of that time. So that, by the last quarter of the 16th century, primero had already decreased in popularity, and was gradually replaced by the [[trick-taking game]] [[Spoil Five|maw]], the favorite card game of James I, and alluded by Harington as supplanting primero. According to [[Charles Cotton]],&lt;ref&gt;''Cotton's Complete Gamester'', ed. of 1721, pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt; primero, which by the time of the Restoration in 1660 had already evolved into many other variations, some of six cards, rapidly went out of fashion with the introduction of the Spanish game of [[Ombre]].

== Rules of the game ==

The object of the game, as in poker, is to attain the highest possible hand, or at least bluff your competitors out of betting against you. There are no existing written rules for the 16th-century primero, only descriptions. However, a number of reconstructions of the game have been made, primarily on the basis of books describing playing strategy and references in period literature.

=== The play ===
Primero is played with a 40-card deck, and there are special decks made for this game. It works best with four to six players. The player who holds the ''prime'', a sequence of the best cards and a good trump, is sure to be successful over the adversaries – hence the game's name.

=== English version ===

Because this is a gambling game, the first step is for all players to ante into the pot. The deal is counter-clockwise, starting with the dealer. Each player receives 4 cards dealt in 2's from a 40-card deck ranking K Q J 7 6 5 4 3 2 A. Anyone dealt a winning combination calls for an immediate showdown, and the player with the best hand wins the pot. Two cards go to each player, which is followed by the next phase of betting, and two more cards are dealt to each player. Then either eight cards are dealt face down on the table and the remaining cards are left out as a draw or stock pile.

Alternatively, eight cards are laid out on the table and players may draw and discard from only these. When a player is satisfied with his cards, he may knock on the table, calling out: ''Vada'' (go!), which brings an immediate showdown won by the best hand. If no one bets, the stakes are carried forward to the next deal; but if one stays in, at least one other must contest the pot, this obligation ultimately falling upon the player immediately ahead of the last bettor if everyone else has folded. In a showdown, the better equal combinations are those with the highest point. Thus, a quartet of aces (4x16=64) beats a quartet of 5s (60), but it's beaten by four 6s (72). Four kings will not beat four queens or jacks, as these hands all count 40. Such ties are broken in favor of the [[eldest hand]] competing.

Players ''vie'' or ''vye'' by stating how high a hand they are claiming to have, and may ''bluff'' by overstating it. What they apparently must not do is to underbid their hands; for as Cardano puts it: "If anyone wins with the greatest point, he is obliged to show another card; otherwise he loses his deposit because he could have a 'Flush'... Similarly, if he 'vies' on the basis of point, he is obliged to show two different cards and one of a matching suit, so that no one may suspect him of having a 'Flush' or 'Prime'."&lt;ref&gt;''King Henry VIII - All is true.'' John Fletcher, Gordan McMullan, pg. 437 – The Arden Shakespeare 2000 {{ISBN|1-903436-25-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A player may either knock or draw in a turn, but not both. Once a player knocks, he may no longer draw. When two players have knocked, the play stops, and cards are shown. Betting starts after the two cards are dealt, and may continue after these two cards have been dealt, and then at every round, just before the dealer's turn. The dealer always bets first. Players may match, raise, or fold any time during wagering. If all players refuse a bet, it must be withdrawn.

=== Italian version ===

In Rome, the full 52-card deck was used.&lt;ref&gt;Zorli, Girolamo. [http://www.tretre.it/menu/accademia-del-tre/documenti-e-articoli/francesco-bernis-primero/ Francesco Berni's Primero] at TreTre. Retrieved 7 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In Florence, it is custom to leave out the 7s, 8s and 9s, keeping and vying only with the smaller cards; the "rest" (''to set up a rest'' means 'to win [something]', and is a phrase which occurs in almost every poem in the times of James and Charles. It is taken from terms used at primero, and perhaps other games then played)&lt;ref&gt;''Supposes'', by Gascoigne, A.3 S.2&lt;/ref&gt; is made at the second card, and when the first player say "pass", every one is obliged to discard, notwithstanding any one may have an ace or a 6 in hand. In Venice, for instance, the mode of playing may be different; in Lombardy, Naples, France and Spain, so many countries, so many customs. But of all the modes, none can be superior to that of the court of Rome. There, the 7s, 8s and 9s are not withdrawn; there it is allowed to discard, but not both cards after "pass" is once said; nor can this be done with the two cards of the ''rest'', as it is usual in other places. The most essential operation of this game may be its two principal hands, the ''flush''{{clarify|date=April 2016|reason=What is the Italian term? Don't switch back and forth between the languages randomly.}} and the ''{{lang|it|primera}}'', and a third, derived from the first, which is called ''{{lang|it|punto}}''; from these three are deducted all the varieties which daily occur at primero, as the greater and lesser ''flush'', the great and little ''prime'', and more or less points; this diversity gives rise to numerous controversies and disputable points. Another excellent hand in this game is four-of-a-kind; four court cards, four aces, etc., beat both the flush and ''{{lang|it|primera}}.

=== Spanish version ===

[[Jacob Le Duchat]], in a note on that chapter of Rabelais,&lt;ref&gt;''Oeuvres de Rabelais avec les remarques de Duchat'', T. 1, pg. 78, 4 to. Amst. 1741&lt;/ref&gt; in which the games Gargantua played at are enumerated, has described the mode of playing primero, and a similar account may be gathered from the ''Dictionary of the Spanish Academy.'' According to Duchat, there are two kinds of primero, the greater and the lesser; the difference between them is that the former is played with the figured cards, while at the latter the highest card is the 7, which counts for 21. Each player has four cards, which are dealt one by one. the next card in value to the 7 is the 6, which counts for 18; then the 6, which counts for 15. The ace is equivalent to 6 points, but the 2 (deuce), the 3 (trey) and the 4 count only for their respective numbers. To these cards may be added, if the players choose, the ''{{lang|es|quinola}}'', for which the jack of hearts is most commonly chosen, and of which he may make what card and what colour he likes. After which each of the players show their four cards, and he whose cards are all of different sorts wins the prime, if they are all of one colour he wins the Flush.
Meanwhile, according to the ''Great Spanish Dictionary'', is played by dealing four cards to each player; the value of the 7, 6 and ace, are the same; but the 2 is said to count for 12, the 3 for 13, the 4 for 14, and the 5 for 15, the figured cards are each equivalent to 10. The best hand is the flush, that is, four cards of high numbers and one of one colour; the next is the ''{{lang|es|punto}}''(supremus), consisting of the ''{{lang|es|quinola}}', 7, 6, and ace, which count for 55; then the {{lang|es|primera}}, or prime, which is four cards of different suits. Should two persons have flushes, the player who counts the highest number, or the greatest flush wins, and the same regulation holds good in regard to the prime. But should there be neither flush nor prime, the one who can count the most points in one suit wins.&lt;ref&gt;''Dicionario de la Lengua Castellana para la Real Academia in voce Primiera'', pg. 563. Ed. 1856&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Quantum of Solace''''' is a 2008 British [[spy film]], the twenty-second in the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' series]] produced by [[Eon Productions]], directed by [[Marc Forster]] and written by [[Paul Haggis]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]].  It is the second film to star [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond]]. The film also stars [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Gemma Arterton]], [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]], and [[Judi Dench]].  In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, [[Vesper Lynd]], and is assisted by [[Camille Montes]], who is plotting revenge for the murder of her own family.  The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman [[Dominic Greene]], a member of the [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] organisation&lt;!-- "Organisation" is British spelling, and the article uses British spelling --&gt;, who intends to stage a ''[[coup d'état]]'' in Bolivia to [[Water privatization in Bolivia|seize control of their water supply]].

Producer [[Michael G. Wilson]] developed the film's plot while the previous film in the series, [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], was being shot.  Purvis, Wade, and Haggis contributed to the script.  Craig and Forster had to write some sections themselves due to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|Writers' Strike]],&lt;ref name=Goldberg /&gt; though they were not given the screenwriter credit in the final cut.  The title was chosen from a 1959&lt;!-- The story was first published in November 1959 in ''Modern Woman's Magazine'', q.v. For Your Eyes Only (short story collection) for the citation --&gt; short story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', though the film does not contain any elements of that story.  Location filming took place in Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]].  Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage [[Douglas DC-3]] was used for a flight sequence, and [[Dennis Gassner]]'s set designs are reminiscent of [[Ken Adam]]'s work on several early ''Bond'' films.  Taking a course away from the usual [[List of James Bond villains|Bond villains]], Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains.

The film was also marked by its frequent depictions of violence, with a 2012 study by the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand finding it to be the most violent film in the franchise.  Whereas ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' featured 109 "trivial or severely violent" acts, ''Quantum of Solace'' had a count of 250—the most depictions of violence in any ''Bond'' film—even more prominent since it was also the shortest film in the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|title=Sean Connery was the girliest Bond|publisher=Meeja|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=6 September 2011|location=Australia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108212058/http://meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|archivedate=8 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Quantum of Solace'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 29 October 2008, gathering mixed reviews, which mainly praised Craig's gritty performance and the film's action sequences, but felt that the film was less impressive than its predecessor ''Casino Royale''.  {{As of|2016|September}}, it is the fourth-highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film, without adjusting for inflation, earning $586&amp;nbsp;million worldwide, and becoming the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh highest-grossing film of 2008]].

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Please remember to keep it short and around 600 words per WikiProject Films/Style guidelines, and that a spoiler warning is unnecessary per Wikipedia:Spoiler. --&gt;
James Bond is driving from [[Lake Garda]] to [[Siena]], Italy, with the captured [[List of James Bond villains#Casino Royale 2006|Mr. White]] ([[Jesper Christensen]]) in the [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] of [[Aston Martin DBS V12|his car]]. After evading pursuers, Bond delivers White to [[M (James Bond)|M]], who interrogates him regarding his organisation, [[SPECTRE#Rebooted continuity|Quantum]]. M's [[bodyguard]], Craig Mitchell (Glenn Foster), is a [[double agent]]; he attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering Mitchell had a contact in [[Haiti]], Edmund Slate ([[Neil Jackson]]). Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill [[Camille Montes]] ([[Olga Kurylenko]]) at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur [[List of James Bond villains#Quantum of Solace|Dominic Greene]] ([[Mathieu Amalric]]). Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano ([[Joaquín Cosío]]), who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow his government and become the new president, in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.

After rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'' in [[Bregenz]], Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s South American section, Gregg Beam ([[David Harbour]]), strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A [[Counter Terrorism Command|Special Branch]] bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines ([[Paul Ritter (actor)|Paul Ritter]]), is killed by one of Greene's men after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally [[List of James Bond allies#René Mathis|René Mathis]] ([[Giancarlo Giannini]]) to accompany him to Bolivia. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields ([[Gemma Arterton]]), a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police working for Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put him in the boot of Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and the cops are killed.

The following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is shot down by a Bolivian fighter aircraft. They [[skydive]] into a [[sinkhole]], and discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a [[monopoly]]. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in [[Petroleum|crude oil]]. Bond meets CIA Agent [[Felix Leiter]] ([[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]), who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet in the [[Atacama Desert]] to finalise their agreement. Warned by Leiter, he evades the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] when they attempt to kill him.

At an [[eco hotel]] in the desert, Greene tells Medrano that now he controls the majority of Bolivia's water supply, Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Planet Bolivia's sole water [[utility company]] at significantly higher rates. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills the chief of police ([[Fernando Guillén Cuervo]]) for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum, leaving him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil, wondering if Greene will get thirsty enough to drink it.

Bond travels to [[Kazan]], Russia, where he finds [[Vesper Lynd]]'s former lover, Yusef Kabira ([[Simon Kassianides]]), a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections, and who is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau ([[Stana Katic]]), a [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|Canadian Intelligence]] agent, of Kabira's true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate. He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Walking away, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.

==Cast==
* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]. Craig's physical training for his reprise of the role placed extra effort into running and boxing, to spare him the injuries he sustained on his stunts in the first film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Martyn Palmer |title=The man with the golden touch |work=[[The Times]] |date=24 November 2007|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article2900516.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0 |accessdate=25 November 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig felt he was fitter, being less bulky than in the first film.&lt;ref name=criminal/&gt; He also practised speedboating and stunt driving.

* [[Mathieu Amalric]] as [[List of James Bond villains#Quantum of Solace|Dominic Greene]], the main villain. He is a leading member of Quantum posing as a businessman working in [[reforestation]] and charity funding for environmental science. In the 2015 Bond film ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', he is revealed to have been a member of the [[SPECTRE|titular crime syndicate]], of which Quantum is a subsidiary. Amalric acknowledged taking the role was an easy decision because, "It's impossible to say to your kids that 'I could have been in a Bond film but I refused.'"&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Amalric wanted to wear make-up for the role, but Forster explained that he wanted Greene not to look grotesque, but to symbolise the hidden evils in society.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; Amalric modelled his performance on "the smile of [[Tony Blair]] [and] the craziness of [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]]," the latter of whom he called "the worst villain we [the French] have ever had … he walks around thinking he's in a Bond film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bond villain spills the beans | work = [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] | date = 24 January 2008 | url = http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/85747-bond-villain-spills-the-beans | accessdate=31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later claimed this was not criticism of either politician, but rather an example of how a politician relies on performance instead of a genuine policy to win power. "Sarkozy, is just a better actor than [his presidential opponent] [[Ségolène Royal]]—that's all," he explained.&lt;ref name=environment/&gt; Amalric and Forster reconceived the character, who was supposed to have a "special skill" in the script, to someone who uses pure animal instinct when fighting Bond in the climax.&lt;ref name=pity&gt;{{cite news|title=Quantum of Solace: Mathieu Amalric on playing James Bond's nemesis|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2 October 2008|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/10/23/sm_mathieuamalric.xml|accessdate=23 October 2008|location=London|first=Murphy|last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruno Ganz]] was also considered for the part,&lt;ref name=diary22&gt;{{cite news |title=Bond 22 Pre-Production Diary (22)|publisher=[[MI6-HQ.com]] |date=30 December 2007 |url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/bond_22_preprod_diary22.php3?t=&amp;s=articles |accessdate=31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Forster decided Amalric gave the character a "pitiful" quality.&lt;ref name=pity/&gt;

* [[Gemma Arterton]] as MI6 agent Strawberry Fields, who works at the British consulate in Bolivia. Fields, who is merely an office worker as described by M, takes herself seriously and tries to overpower Bond when the pair meet. She is later seduced by Bond, infiltrates Greene's fund raiser party with him and ends up paying the ultimate price. Forster found Arterton a witty actress and selected her from a reported 1,500 candidates. One of the casting directors asked her to audition for the role, having seen her portray Rosaline in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' at the [[Globe Theatre]].&lt;ref name=dianarigg&gt;{{cite news | author = Chris Tilly | title = Gemma Arteron Q&amp;A | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 30 January 2008 | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/848/848237p1.html | accessdate = 30 January 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080201171744/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/848/848237p1.html | archivedate = 1 February 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arterton said Fields was "not so frolicsome" as other Bond girls, but is instead "fresh and young, not … a [[femme fatale]]."&lt;ref name=bbctitle/&gt; Arterton described Fields as a homage to the 1960s Bond girls, comparing her red wig to that of [[Diana Rigg]], who played [[Tracy Bond]] in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''. Rigg, alongside [[Honor Blackman]], is one of her favourite Bond girls.&lt;ref name=dianarigg/&gt; Arterton had to film her character's death scene first day on the set, where she was completely covered head to toe in non-toxic black paint.

Marc Forster asked his friends and fellow directors [[Guillermo del Toro]] and [[Alfonso Cuarón]] to appear in cameos.

Michael G. Wilson decided on the film's title ''Quantum of Solace'' only "a few days" before its announcement on 24 January 2008.&lt;ref name=bbctitle&gt;{{cite news |title=New Bond film title is confirmed |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=24 January 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7206997.stm |accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the name of a short story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s anthology ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' (1960).&lt;ref name=confuse/&gt; The film is related to the title in one of its thematic elements: "when the 'Quantum of Solace' drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone." Daniel Craig admitted, "I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in your relationship then the relationship is over. It's that spark of niceness in a relationship that if you don't have you might as well give up."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; He said that "Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend [Vesper Lynd] has been killed,"&lt;ref name=confuse&gt;{{cite news |title=Daniel: the title is meant to confuse |work=[[Press and Journal (Scotland)|Press and Journal]] |date=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore, "[Bond is] looking for revenge … to make himself happy with the world again."&lt;ref name=bbctitle/&gt; Afterwards, Quantum was made the name of the organisation introduced in ''Casino Royale''.&lt;ref name=quantum/&gt; Craig noted the letter Q itself looks rather odd.&lt;ref name=criminal/&gt; Near the end of the film, the Camille Montes character and Bond have a discussion about their individual quests to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Montes asks Bond to "let me know what it feels like" when he succeeds, the implication of the title being that it will be a small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.

According to a December 2011 interview with Craig, "We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers' strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes—and a writer I am not."&lt;ref name=Goldberg&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|title=Daniel Craig Talks about the Script Problems on QUANTUM OF SOLACE; Says Why He's Encouraged for SKYFALL|url=http://collider.com/daniel-craig-quantum-of-solace-script-problems/130951/|publisher=Collider|accessdate=29 August 2012|date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he and Forster "were the ones allowed to do it. The rules were that you couldn't employ anyone as a writer, but the actor and director could work on scenes together. We were stuffed. We got away with it, but only just. It was never meant to be as much of a sequel as it was, but it ended up being a sequel, starting where the last one finished."&lt;ref name=Goldberg/&gt;

Shooting in [[Panama City]] began on 7 February 2008 at [[Howard Air Force Base]]. The country doubled for Haiti and Bolivia, with the National Institute of Culture of Panama standing in for a hotel in the latter country. A sequence requiring several hundred [[extra (actor)|extras]] was also shot at nearby [[Colón, Panama|Colón]].&lt;ref name=andeanhotel&gt;{{cite news | title = Production Diary (11) | publisher = [[MI6-HQ.com]] | date = 9 February 2008 | url = http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/bond_22_prod_diary11.php3?t=qos&amp;s=qos | accessdate=9 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shooting in Panama was also carried out at [[Fort Sherman]], a former US military base on the Colón coast.

During filming in [[Sierra Gorda, Chile]], the local mayor, Carlos Lopez, staged a protest because he was angry at the filmmakers' portrayal of the [[Antofagasta Region]] as part of Bolivia. He was arrested, detained briefly, and put on trial two days later.

From 4–12 April the main unit shot on Sienese rooftops.&lt;ref name=fountain/&gt; Shooting on the real rooftops turned out to be less expensive than building them at Pinewood.&lt;ref name=artfilm/&gt; The next four weeks were scheduled for filming the car chase at [[Lake Garda]] and [[Carrara]].&lt;ref name=fountain/&gt; On 19 April, an [[Aston Martin]] employee driving a [[Aston Martin DBS V12|DBS]] to the set crashed into the lake. He survived, and was fined £400 for reckless driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Nick Pisa | title = Driver of James Bond's Aston Martin cheated death in dramatic crash |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another accident occurred on 21 April, and two days later, two stuntmen were seriously injured, with one, Greek stuntman Aris Comninos, having to be put in intensive care. Filming of the scenes was temporarily halted so that Italian police could investigate the causes of the accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Paul Bompard | title = James Bond production halted amid fears of a curse |work=[[The Times]] | date = 24 April 2008 | url =http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article3810782.ece | accessdate=24 April 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell said the accidents were a testament to the realism of the action.&lt;ref name=empire/&gt; Rumours of a "curse" spread among tabloid media, something which deeply offended Craig, who disliked that they compared Comninos' accident to something like his minor finger injury later on the shoot (also part of the "curse"). Comninos recovered safely from his injury.&lt;ref name=criminal/&gt;

For the role Craig trained to be less bulky than in ''Casino Royale'' and told ''[[Men's Fitness]]'' magazine "In fact, I was much fitter for this film compared to ''Casino Royale''—I really had to be—and I was running a hell of a lot more in training, just so I could do these scenes, whereas last time I spent far more time pumping heavy weights to bulk up so I could look big."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mattpomroy.com/2008/12/01/quantum-physique/|title=Quantum Physique|date=2008-12-01|website=Matt Pomroy|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming took place at the [[Bregenzer Festspiele|floating opera stage]] at [[Bregenz]], Austria, from 28 April – 9 May 2008. The sequence in which Bond stalks the villains during a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'' required 1,500 extras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Production Diary (10) | publisher = [[MI6-HQ.com]] | date = 8 February 2008 | url = http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/bond_22_prod_diary10.php3?t=qos&amp;s=qos | accessdate=9 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production used a large model of an eye, which Forster felt fitted in the Bond style, and the opera itself has parallels to the film.&lt;ref name=lake&gt;{{cite news|title='Quantum of Solace' set visit: filming in Austria; Craig's next Bond moves; 007's new foes; rumors laid to rest|publisher=[[MSN]]|date=8 May 2008|url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/hitlist/05-13-08|accessdate=16 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010045516/http://movies.msn.com/movies/hitlist/05-13-08/|archivedate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short driving sequence was filmed at the nearby [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Production Diary (1) |publisher=[[MI6-HQ.com]] |date=3 January 2008|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/bond_22_prod_diary01.php3?t=&amp;s=articles |accessdate=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew returned to Italy from 13–17 May to shoot a (planned) car crash at the marble quarry in Carrara,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Production Diary (32) | publisher = [[MI6-HQ.com]] | date = 16 May 2008 | url = http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/bond_22_prod_diary32.php3?t=qos&amp;s=qos | accessdate=16 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a recreation of the Palio di Siena at the [[Piazza del Campo]] in Siena. 1,000 extras were hired for a scene where Bond emerges from the ''Fonte Gaia''. Originally, he would have emerged from the city's cisterns at [[Siena Cathedral]], but this was thought disrespectful.&lt;ref name=fountain/&gt; By June the crew returned to Pinewood for four weeks,&lt;ref name=lake/&gt; where new sets (including the interior of the hotel in the climax) were built.&lt;ref name=zetumer/&gt;&lt;ref name=modernism/&gt; The [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party was held on 21 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 'Quantum of Solace' wrap party held on Saturday night, David Arnold confirms | publisher = [[MI6-HQ.com]] | date = 22 June 2008 | url = http://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=6394 | accessdate=22 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louise Frogley replaced [[Lindy Hemming]] as [[costume design]]er, though Hemming remained as supervisor. Hemming hired [[Brioni (fashion)|Brioni]] for Bond's suits since her tenure on the series began with 1995's ''[[GoldenEye]]'', but Lindsay Pugh, another supervisor, explained their suits were "too relaxed." [[Tom Ford]] was hired to tailor "sharper" suits for Craig. Pugh said the costumes aimed towards the 1960s feel, especially for Bond and Fields. [[Prada]] provided the dresses for both Bond girls. [[Jasper Conran]] designed Camille's ginger bandeau, bronze skirt and gold fish necklace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jasperconran.com/collections/womenswear/archive/james-bond,116,ART.html |title=Jasper Conran Spring Summer 2008 Collection |publisher=Jasperconran.com |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Chrome Hearts]] designed gothic jewellery for Amalric's character, which the actor liked enough to keep after filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jessica Fellowes|title=James Bond week: 007 and his girls are back with a crisp new look|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=22 October 2008|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG3365681/James-Bond-week-007-and-his-girls-are-back-with-a-crisp-new-look.html|accessdate=25 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophie Harley, who created [[Vesper Lynd]]'s earrings and Algerian loveknot necklace in ''Casino Royale'', was called upon to create another version of the necklace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jessica Fellowes|title=Necklace with a starring role|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=22 October 2008|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG3365680/Necklace-with-a-starring-role.html|accessdate=25 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film returns to the traditional [[James Bond gun barrel sequence|gun barrel opening shot]], which was altered into part of the story for ''Casino Royale'' where it was moved to the beginning of the title sequence. In this film the gun barrel sequence was moved to the end of the movie, which Wilson explained was done for a surprise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Caro|title=15 James Bond facts you need to know|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=9 November 2008|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-11-09/news/0811070249_1_casino-royale-daniel-craig-olga-kurylenko|accessdate=8 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to signify the conclusion of the story begun in the previous film. The opening credits sequence was created by [[MK12]]. Having worked on Forster's ''[[Stranger than Fiction (2006 film)|Stranger than Fiction]]'' and ''[[The Kite Runner (film)|The Kite Runner]]'', MK12 spontaneously began developing the sequence early on in production, and had a good idea of its appearance which meant it did not have to be redone when the [[#Music|title singer]] was changed. MK12 selected various twilight colours to represent Bond's mood and focused on a dot motif based on the gunbarrel shot.

Aerial shots using helicopters were banned, and the crew were also forbidden from showing any violence "involving either people or animals."&lt;ref name=paliodisiena/&gt; To shoot the foot chase in [[Siena]] in April 2008 four camera cranes were built in the town, and a [[Skycam|cable camera]] was also used.&lt;ref name=siena/&gt; [[Framestore]] worked on the Siena chase, duplicating the 1,000 extras during principal photography to match shots of the 40,000-strong audience at the real Palio, removing wires that held Craig and the stuntmen in the rooftop segment of the chase, and digital expansion of the floor and skylight in the art gallery Bond and Mitchell fall into.&lt;ref name=vfxworld/&gt; The art gallery fight was intended to be simple, but during filming Craig's stunt double accidentally fell from the construction scaffolding. Forster preferred the idea of Bond hanging from ropes reaching for his gun to kill Mitchell, rather than having both men run out of the building to continue their chase as specified in the script, and the number of effects shots increased.&lt;ref name=vfxworld/&gt;

To film the aerial dogfight, a "Snakehead" camera was built and placed on the nose and tail of a [[Piper Aerostar]] 700. [[SolidWorks]], who provided the software used to design the camera, stated "pilots for the first time can fly as aggressively as they dare without sacrificing the drama of the shot." The camera could turn 360 degrees and was shaped like a [[periscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Chris Reidy | title = "Snakehead" films James Bond dogfight footage |work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date = 12 May 2008 | url = http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2008/05/_the_concord_of.html | accessdate=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew also mounted SpaceCams on helicopters, and placed cameras with 1600mm lenses underground, to cover the action.&lt;ref name=dogfight/&gt; Forster wanted to film the plane fight as a homage to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[North by Northwest]]'', and chose planes like the [[Douglas DC-3]] to suit that.&lt;ref name=aicnqa&gt;{{cite news|title=Capone talks with James Bond himself, Daniel Craig, and Quantum of Solace director Marc Forster in London!!!|publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=21 September 2008|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/38427|accessdate=22 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=For Your Eyes Only: RT in Austria with James Bond |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=9 May 2008 |url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/quantum_of_solace/news/1727255/2/for_your_eyes_only_rt_in_austria_with_james_bond |accessdate=16 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208092012/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/quantum_of_solace/news/1727255/2/for_your_eyes_only_rt_in_austria_with_james_bond |archivedate= 8 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[free-fall]] scene involved its own set of challenges; Craig disliked the idea of "being hung by wires and blown by a large fan in front of a green screen"{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}, but actual [[sky diving]] coverage has serious drawbacks. It's not only difficult, dangerous and time-consuming, but nearly always results in problematic head-replacements for close-ups{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell and VFX Designer [[Kevin Tod Haug]] presented the idea of filming the scene in a large [[vertical wind tunnel]] in [[Bedford]] to do this sequence as practically as possible{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.
While a great solution for the actors' performances, the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the sky over the Bolivian desert; and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight [[Dalsa Origin]] cameras (supported by seven HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was used to create a [[virtual camera]] with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. [[Ged Wright]] and his team at [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]]&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in a synthetic environment as seen by a synthetic camera.
During the shooting in the wind tunnel Craig and Kurylenko wore wind-resistant contact lenses that enabled them to open their eyes as they fell. For safety and comfort, they only shot for 30 seconds at a time.&lt;ref name=ugoqa&gt;{{cite news|url=http://movieblog.ugo.com/index.php/movieblog/more/your_quantum_of_solace_questions_answered/ |title=Your Quantum of Solace Questions Answered! |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |date=21 September 2008 |accessdate=22 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924230111/http://movieblog.ugo.com/index.php/movieblog/more/your_quantum_of_solace_questions_answered/ |archivedate=24 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forster wished he had had more time to work on the free-fall scene.&lt;ref name=vfxworld/&gt;

The [[Moving Picture Company]] created the climactic hotel sequence. The fire effects were supervised by [[Chris Corbould]], and post-production MPC had to enhance the sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, so it would look more dangerous.&lt;ref name=vfxworld/&gt; A full-scale replica of the building's exterior was used for the exploding part Bond and Camille escape from.
The boat chase was another scene that required very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing a few shots of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head,&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle to make it look more dangerous.&lt;ref name=vfxworld/&gt; Crowd creation was done for the ''[[Tosca]]'' scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out.&lt;ref name=fxguide&gt;{{cite news|title=Back into Bondage|date=16 November 2008|author=Bill Dawes|publisher=[[fxguide]]|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/back_into_bondage/|accessdate=22 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forster edited the opera scene to resemble ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]''.&lt;ref name=comingsoon/&gt; In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in ''Quantum of Solace''.&lt;ref name=vfxworld/&gt;

[[David Arnold]], who composed the scores for the previous four Bond films, returned for ''Quantum of Solace''.

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an [[approval rating]] of 65% based on 285 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Brutal and breathless, ''Quantum Of Solace'' delivers tender emotions along with frenetic action, but coming on the heels of ''Casino Royale'', it's still a bit of a disappointment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/quantum_of_solace/|title=Quantum of Solace (2008)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/quantum-of-solace|title=Quantum of Solace Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics generally preferred ''Casino Royale'', but continued to praise  Daniel Craig's depiction of Bond, and agree that the film is still an enjoyable addition to the series. The action sequences and pacing were praised, but criticism grew over the realism and serious but gritty feel that the film carried over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Butler |title=UK Tomatometer Preview: Quantum Of Solace – Is the New Bond Shaken or Stirred? |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=31 October 2008 |url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/quantum_of_solace/news/1777726/uk_tomatometer_preview_quantum_of_solace_is_the_new_bond_shaken_or_stirred |accessdate=1 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106152925/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/quantum_of_solace/news/1777726/uk_tomatometer_preview_quantum_of_solace_is_the_new_bond_shaken_or_stirred |archivedate= 6 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Moore]], the third actor to play Bond in the films, said that  Daniel Craig was a "damn good Bond but the film as a whole, there was a bit too much flash cutting [and] it was just like a commercial of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what the hell was going on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir Roger Moore weighs in on 'Quantum of Solace'|publisher=[[MI6-HQ.com]]|date=16 March 2009|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=7432&amp;t=mi6&amp;s=news|accessdate=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Newman]] of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' gave it 4/5, remarking it was not "bigger and better than ''Casino Royale'', [which is] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun." However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Kim Newman]]|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134523|title=''Quantum of Solace'' (12A)|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' review noted that "following ''Casino Royale'' was never going to be easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth—with a yawn"; the screenplay "is at times incomprehensible" and the casting "is a mess." The review concludes that "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get [[product placement]]; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Cosmo Landesman]]|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article5001623.ece|title=Quantum of Solace – The Sunday Times review|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=26 October 2008|accessdate=28 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave a more positive review, rating it as 4 stars, and was particularly fond of  Daniel Craig's performance, saying he "made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" and calling the film "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes "''Quantum of Solace'' isn't as good as ''Casino Royale'': the smart elegance off Daniel  Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Peter Bradshaw]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/18/jamesbond1|title=Quantum of Solace|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=18 October 2008|accessdate=28 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]'' says, "Notices will focus—rightly—on Craig's magnetism as the steely, sexy, murderous MI6 agent, but two other factors weigh in and freshen up proceedings: Forster's new technical team, led by cinematographer Roberto Schaefer and production designer Dennis Gassner. And the ongoing shift of M, as played by Judi Dench, to front and centre: the Bond girls fade into insignificance as she becomes his moral counterpoint and theirs is the only real relationship on screen." The review continues, "Bond is, as has been previously noted, practically the [[Martin Scorsese]] of the [[BAFTA]]s: 22 films later, with grosses probably close to the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of one of the small nations it depicts, it's still waiting for that [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film|Alexander Korda award]]. The best ''Casino Royale'' could achieve was a gong for sound. Will this be the year that changes its fortunes?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantum of Solace|publisher=Screen Daily|date=20 October 2008|url=http://www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=41477|accessdate=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', who praised the previous film, disliked ''Quantum of Solace''. He wrote that the plot was mediocre, characters weak and that Bond lacked his usual personality, despite his praise for Daniel Craig's interpretation of the role. Throughout his review, he emphasised that "James Bond is not an action hero."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081111/REVIEWS/811129989 Review] by Roger Ebert, ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', 12 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kate Muir]] wrote in ''[[The Times]]'' that "The ''Bond'' franchise is 50 years old this year, and the scriptless mess of ''Quantum of Solace'' may be considered its mid-life crisis", before she went on to praise the film's successor ''[[Skyfall]]'' as a "resurrection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Muir|first=Kate|title=Bond's resurrection is one to die for|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=13 October 2012|authorlink=Kate Muir|location=London|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers criticised the choice of ''Quantum of Solace'' as a title. "Yes, it's a bad title," wrote Marni Weisz, the editor of ''Famous'', a Canadian film publication distributed in cinemas in that country, in an editorial entitled "At least it's not ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Marni Weisz, "At least it's not Octopussy," ''Famous'', October 2008, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all the reviews were as critical. Tim Robey of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', in a reflective review of the film in 2013, was positive. He praised the film's shorter runtime, claiming that many other ''Bond'' films run out of steam before the end, and included ''Casino Royale'' in this category. Describing the film as having a "rock-solid dramatic idea and the intelligence to run with it", he gave the film four stars out of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robey|first=Tim|title=James Bond: Quantum of Solace, Review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10540055/James-Bond-Quantum-of-Solace-review.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 December 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Race Pro''''' is a [[sim racing]] [[video game]] developed by SimBin Studios (later [[Sector3 Studios]]) and published by [[Atari]] exclusively for [[Xbox 360]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=IGN RacePro| publisher=IGN| url=http://xbox360.ign.com/objects/142/14254925.html| date=| accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is described as having "ultra realistic car models" with cars ranging in power from {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1000|hp|abbr=on}}. The game uses the new Lizard game engine whereas the PC SimBin games used the Gmotor engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=RacePro Atari Gamer's Day2008 Interview Prt.1| publisher=Gamespot | url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/driving/racepro/video/6197609/racepro-atari-gamers-day-2008-interview-1| date=| accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the first console game completed and released by SimBin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=PC racing sim developer SimBin takes the console plunge| publisher=IGN| url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/888/888242p1.html| date=| accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game uses the ISI (RFactor) game engine under license. It features cars and drivers from the 2007, 2006 and the original 1987 [[FIA]] [[World Touring Car Championship]] seasons, as well as the European F3000, Formula BMW, Mini Challenge and Caterham cup. The game also has three [[FIA GT Championship|GT]] categories, on top of this it has racing [[Radical Sportscars|Radicals]] and road cars which are the [[Audi R8 (road car)|Audi R8]], [[Koenigsegg CCX]], [[Koenigsegg CCXR]] and [[Dodge Viper]].

The drivers in the game are mostly real people, such as [[Tiff Needell]], [[Tor Graves]], and all the Touring car drivers of the [[2007 World Touring Car Championship season|2007 FIA WTCC championship]].

==Tracks==
Tracks available in the game are those that were used in the 2007 WTCC and only the configuration used that year is available to drive for each circuit. They can all be raced in offline and online and in wet and dry conditions with up to sixteen entrants.

[[Autódromo Internacional de Curitiba]], [[Pau Grand Prix|Circuit de Pau]], Macau's [[Guia Circuit]] and [[Circuito da Boavista|Porto Circuit]] had not been playable before on seventh-generation consoles though you could drive around Macau and sections of the Guia Circuit in [[Project Gotham Racing 4]].

The other tracks are [[Circuit de Valencia]], [[Brno Circuit]], [[Brands Hatch]], [[Motorsport Arena Oschersleben]], [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza]], [[Scandinavian Raceway|Anderstorp Raceway]], [[Circuit Park Zandvoort]], [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]], and [[Road America]].

==Reception==

''Race Pro'' has received mixed ratings, with an average [[Metacritic]] score of 72%. The main criticisms were the grainy textures and large amounts of [[Screen tearing|tearing]], sparsely constructed tracks, and lack of in-game music. The game has an issue whereby it can sometimes lose players' saved career progress when going online. Wet weather is cosmetic only, so grip levels do not change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=RacePro Metacritic Score |publisher=Metacritic |url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/racepro |date=| accessdate=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sveriges Radio [[Aktiebolag|AB]]''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈsværjɛs ˈrɑːdɪʊ}}, "Swedish Radio") is [[Sweden]]'s national publicly funded [[radio programming|radio]] broadcaster. Sveriges Radio is a [[public limited company]], owned by an independent foundation, and funded through a [[television licence|licensing fee]], the level of which is decided by the [[Riksdag|Swedish Riksdag]]. No advertising is permitted. Its legal status could be described as that of a [[quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation|quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization]].

==History==
The company – which was founded as '''AB Radiotjänst''' ("Radio Service Ltd") by a consortium of newspaper companies, the [[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå|TT news agency]], and radio manufacturing interests on 21 March 1924 – made its first broadcast on 1 January 1925: a relay of High Mass from [[Saint James's Church, Stockholm|St James's Church]] in [[Stockholm]]. It was officially renamed Sveriges Radio in 1957.

Sveriges Radio was originally responsible for all broadcasting in Sweden, both radio and television, and hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975 Eurovision Song Contest]]. A reorganization in 1979 saw it become the parent company of four subsidiaries:
*Sveriges Riksradio (RR), ''Swedish National Radio'';
*Sveriges Lokalradio (LRAB), ''Swedish Local Radio'';
*[[Sveriges Utbildningsradio]] (UR), ''Swedish Educational Broadcasting''; and
*[[Sveriges Television]] (SVT), ''Swedish Television''.

This structure was dissolved in 1993 with the national and local radio companies merging under the name of the old parent company: Sveriges Radio AB.

== National radio ==
Four radio channels are available nationwide on [[FM radio|FM]] and via the [[internet]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=3756&amp;artikel=3649665 Direktlänkar, kanaler i MP3 (192 kbps)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716115450/http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=3756&amp;artikel=3649665 |date=2012-07-16 }}", links to channels streaming in mp3 format.

'''''The Hebrew Hammer''''' is a 2003 American [[comedy film]] written and directed by Jonathan Kesselman. It stars [[Adam Goldberg]], [[Judy Greer]], [[Andy Dick]], [[Mario Van Peebles]], and [[Peter Coyote]]. The plot concerns a [[Jewish]] [[blaxploitation]] crime fighter known as the Hebrew Hammer who must save [[Hanukkah]] from the evil son of [[Santa Claus]], who wants to destroy Hanukkah and [[Kwanzaa]] and make everyone celebrate [[Christmas]].

The film parodies blaxploitation films, and features [[Melvin Van Peebles]] in a cameo as "[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song|Sweetback]]".

==Plot==
The film begins with a flashback to a young Mordechai Jefferson Carver. At school, Mordechai is tormented by his fellow students and his teacher for being a Jewish child in a public school predominantly attended by Christians, and for celebrating Hanukkah while everyone else celebrates Christmas. He feels further alienated as he walks through his neighborhood and sees a seemingly endless number of Christmas decorations and window displays celebrating the holiday and announcing that Jews aren't welcome. As he lies down on the sidewalk in front of a store saying "Jews Welcome (for about 5 minutes)" and spins his [[dreidel]] to cheer himself up, Santa Claus walks by and crushes the toy under his foot, then gives Mordechai the [[middle finger|finger]].

The scene then changes to the present with Mordechai as the Hebrew Hammer, a certified [[Male circumcision|circumcised]] [[Detective|dick]] who has dedicated his life to defending Jews. His snappy dress (a cross between that of a pimp and a [[Hasidic Jew]]) and tough-guy demeanor have made him a local hero within the Jewish community. Jews and African-Americans have enjoyed a tenuous peace with the White Christians over the previous few decades, because the current Santa (the son of the cruel Santa who stomped Mordechai's dreidel years earlier) has pursued a policy of inclusion and tolerance.  This Santa is murdered and replaced by his son, Damian, who seeks to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa thus reserving December for Christmas alone. Mordechai is reluctantly recruited to stop Damian, gaining allies along the way, including love interest and daughter of the Chief of the Jewish Justice League Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal and the Kwanzaa Liberation Front's leader Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim.

The fight takes them to exotic locales such as [[Israel]], [[K-Mart]], the Jewish Atomic Clock outside [[Jerusalem]] and the final battle at the [[North Pole]].

==Controversy==
''The Hebrew Hammer'' parodies many common [[stereotype]]s about Jews. During filming, the movie came to the attention of the [[Anti-Defamation League]], which were concerned that it might promote unfavorable images of Jews; the film happens to include a direct parody of the ADL as members of the fictional Jewish Justice League. After viewing the film, Warren Katz of the ADL brought legal action against the producers of the film, but lost in a summary ruling handed down by the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]]. The film also drew criticism from some Christian groups, who argued that the film portrayed most Christians as being anti-Semitic and intolerant. 

Many scenes were shot in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], [[Brooklyn]], which has a large community of Hasidic Jews. Filmmakers were initially concerned that members of the Hasidic community might protest the movie, as they did with the 1998 film ''[[A Price Above Rubies]]'', and shut down filming. Reaction of the Hasidim in Borough Park was mixed, however. No organized protest was pursued, and some residents of the neighborhood actually agreed to appear as extras in the film.

==Reception==
The film received a rating of 52% on aggregate review site [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|hebrew_hammer|The Hebrew Hammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In 2017, plans for a sequel titled ''The Hebrew Hammer Vs. Hitler''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2568284/|title=The Hebrew Hammer vs. Hitler}}&lt;/ref&gt; were announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/TheHebrewHammerII|title=The Hebrew Hammer II|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/life/film/1.824074|title=The Hebrew Hammer Is Set to Fight His Biggest Foes Yet - Hitler and anti-Semitism|last=|date=|website=Haaretz|publisher=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequel will be funded in part by crowd funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://app.microventures.com/crowdfunding/hebrew-hammer-2|title=MicroVentures - The Hebrew Hammer Vs. Hitler|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will begin in the present day, with the Hammer coming out of retirement to fight the increase in racism brought on by Donald Trump's election. He does this by going back in time to fight the worst source of antisemitism in the 20th century.

'''''The Magician's Hat''''' (Čarobnjakov šešir) is a [[1990 in film|1990 animated film]] produced by the [[Croatia Film]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkD9AnoQecE CAROBNJAKOV SESIR-Trailer on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; company and directed by [[Milan Blažeković]]. It is the sequel to 1986's ''[[The Elm-Chanted Forest]]''. 

==Story==
Thistle the magician teams up with his animal friends, along with some fairies and a volcano-dwelling dragon, to rescue their forest from the wrath of Mrazomor the Ice Emperor and his army of icy ghost witches. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film691828.html FilmAffinity]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://mubi.com/films/the-magician-s-hat MUBI]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
In late 2007, both this film and its predecessor, ''The Elm-Chanted Forest'', received their DVD debut in the countries of former Yugoslavia from Happy TV. As of 2015, ''The Magician's Hat'' has seen no official release in North America. 

==Cancelled US release==
[[Peter Fernandez]] was working on an English dub for this film, but it was ultimately cancelled by American Distributors for reasons unknown, yet possibly due to the scene where Mrazomor gets stabbed in the chest by the Sword of Salvation  and thought it was too dark for Western viewers, namely children.

'''Thoth''' (stylised as '''THOTH''') is an abstract [[shoot 'em up]] video game created by Jeppe Carlsen, former lead gameplay designer of [[Playdead]] games ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]'' and ''[[Inside (video game)|Inside]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/thoth-a-trippy-deconstruction-of-arcade-shooters-w443624|title=New Game 'Thoth' Is a Trippy Deconstruction of Arcade Shooters|last=Walden|first=Matthew|date=5 October 2016|work=|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=2016-10-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurogamer.es/articles/2016-09-05-double-fine-anuncia-thoth|title=Double Fine anuncia Thoth|last=Maria Sempere|first=Josep|date=5 September 2016|work=|newspaper=Eurogamer.es|language=es|access-date=2016-10-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published by [[Double Fine Productions]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/09/double-fine-presents-thoth-new-game-from-inside-pu.html|title=Double Fine Presents Thoth, New Game from Inside Puzzle Designer Jeppe Carlsen|last=Wade|first=Cameron|date=2 September 2016|work=|newspaper=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|access-date=2016-10-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
As a solo developer, Carlsen had previously worked on independent platformer [[140 (video game)|''140'']].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Carlsen had thought about designing a game inspired by ''[[Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved]]'' and ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'' before he started working on ''Limbo''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indiegames.com/2016/10/thoth.html|title=IndieGames.com THOTH Is A Horror Game, Disguised As Twin-Stick Shooter|last=Faust|first=Thomas|date=10 October 2016|website=indiegames.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music for the game was composed by [[Experimental music|experimental]] composers SØS Gunver Ryberg and [[Cristian Vogel]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Progress through the levels of the game is made by eliminating all enemies. Doing so transforms them into ghostly voids that relentlessly chase the player. The game can be played solo or with two players cooperatively; when playing with a second player, the first player to die will become a ghost void that haunts the player. The main sequence of levels are divided into sets of four, each introducing new enemy types and [[game mechanics]]. If the main 64 levels are completed, the player gains access to randomly generated levels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Tropical Village''' is a theme park in [[Ayer Hitam]], [[Batu Pahat District]], [[Johor]], [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosmo.com.my/kosmo/content.asp?y=2008&amp;dt=0720&amp;pub=Kosmo&amp;sec=Jom_Singgah&amp;pg=jo_01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The replicas of the structures are built within this 32 acres theme park that allow visitors to have another memorable experience. The park is divided into four sections: Landmarks, Leisure Corner, Playground and Agricultural Enclosure.

The Landmarks Section is a garden with a wonderful famous landmark in the whole world. There's a section of Malay Culture like [[Kompang]] sculpture, [[Kuda Kepang]], Mini Malaysia such as [[Petronas Towers]], [[Fort A famosa]] and Mini World.

The Leisure Corner is especially appealing to younger visitors with its Haunted House, House of Mirrors and Dinosaur Train among other attractions. The Playground with its Oriental Island, Pet Corner and Garden of the Shy Monkey is also a favourite with little ones. The park has dorms for visitors who want to stay overnight and continue the fun the next day.

Though '''women artists''' have been involved in the making of art throughout history, their work, when compared to that of their male counterparts, is often both overlooked and undervalued. Prevailing stereotypes about the sexes have caused certain media, such as [[Textile arts|textile]] or [[fiber art]]s, to be primarily associated with women, despite having once been categories both men and women participated in. Additionally, art forms that have gained this distinction are, as in the case of both textile and fabric arts, demoted to categories like "[[Arts and Crafts movement|arts and crafts]]", rather than [[fine art]].&lt;ref name="moca"&gt;Aktins, Robert. [http://www.moca.org/pc/viewArtTerm.php?id=14 "Feminist art."] ''Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.'' 1997 (retrieved 23 Aug 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in art have been faced with challenges due to gender biases in the mainstream fine art world.&lt;ref name="moca" /&gt; They have often encountered difficulties in training, travelling and trading their work, as well as gaining recognition. Beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s, [[feminist]] artists and art historians created a [[Feminist art movement]] that overtly addresses the role of women in the art world and explores the role of women in [[art history]]&lt;ref name="moca" /&gt; and in society.

==Prehistoric era==
There are no records of who the artists of the prehistoric eras were, but studies of many early ethnographers and cultural anthropologists indicate that women often were the principal artisans in [[Neolithic]] cultures, in which they created pottery, textiles, baskets, painted surfaces and jewelry. Collaboration on large projects was typical. Extrapolation to the artwork and skills of the [[Paleolithic]] era suggests that these cultures followed similar patterns. [[Cave painting]]s of this era often have human hand prints, 75% of which are identifiable as women's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131008-women-handprints-oldest-neolithic-cave-art/ "Were the First Artists Mostly Women?"]  "National Geographic", October 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient historical era==
{{Women in society sidebar}}

===India===
"For about three thousand years, the women – and only the women – of [[History of Mithila|Mithila]] have been making devotional paintings of the gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon. It is no exaggeration, then, to say that this art is the expression of the most genuine aspect of Indian civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Vequaud, Ives, ''Women Painters of Mithila'', Thames and Hudson, Ltd., London, 1977 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Europe and the Middle East===
The earliest records of western cultures rarely mention specific individuals, although women are depicted in all of the art and some are shown laboring as artists. Ancient references by [[Homer]], [[Cicero]], and [[Virgil]] mention the prominent roles of women in textiles, poetry, music, and other cultural activities, without discussion of individual artists. Among the earliest European historical records concerning individual artists is that of [[Pliny the Elder]], who wrote about a number of Greek women who were painters, including [[Helena of Egypt]], daughter of Timon of Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/elliott/art/67.html Women in Art] retrieved January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1479.html The Ancient Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026153755/http://ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1479.html |date=2010-10-26 }} Retrieved January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern critics posit that ''[[Alexander Mosaic]]'' might not have been the work of [[Philoxenus of Cythera|Philoxenus]], but of Helena of Egypt. One of the few named women painters who might have worked in Ancient Greece,&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad; Oppenheimer; Addiss, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summers, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; she was reputed to have produced a painting of the battle of Issus which hung in the [[Temple of Peace, Rome|Temple of Peace]] during the time of [[Vespasian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ptolemy Chennus|Ptolemy Hephaestion]] ''New History'' (codex 190) [[Bibliotheca (Photius)|''Bibliotheca'' Photius]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other women include [[Timarete]], [[Eirene (artist)|Eirene]], Kalypso, Aristarete, [[Iaia]], and Olympias. While only some of their work survives, in [[Red-figure pottery|Ancient Greek pottery]] there is a ''caputi hydria'' in the Torno Collection in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/628077 The Caputi Hydria] Retrieved June 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It is attribute to [[List of Greek vase painters|the Leningrad painter]] from {{circa|460–450}} [[common era|BCE]] and shows women working alongside men in a workshop where both painted vases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1jWo_YaOW4UC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;dq=caputi+hydria+in+The+Torno+Collection+in+Milan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jtkVLNQ0hw&amp;sig=1UhqdRBJtJuM2LmKGQgOQX321vA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=j9EYTOSzB8GB8gaTnt24DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=caputi%20hydria%20in%20The%20Torno%20Collection%20in%20Milan&amp;f=false Fig. 37] Retrieved June 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Artists from the [[Medieval]] period include [[Claricia]], [[Diemudus]], [[Ende (artist)|Ende]], [[Guda]], [[Herrade of Landsberg]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]]. In the early Medieval period, women often worked alongside men. Manuscript illuminations, embroideries, and carved capitals from the period clearly demonstrate examples of women at work in these arts. Documents show that they also were brewers, butchers, wool merchants, and iron mongers. Artists of the time period, including women, were from a small subset of society whose status allowed them freedom from these more strenuous types of work. Women artists often were of two literate classes, either wealthy aristocratic women or nuns. Women in the former category often created embroideries and textiles; those in the later category often produced illuminations.

There were a number of embroidery workshops in England at the time, particularly at Canterbury and Winchester; ''[[Opus Anglicanum]]'' or English embroidery was already famous across Europe – a 13th-century papal inventory counted over two hundred pieces. It is presumed that women were almost entirely responsible for this production. One of the most famous embroideries of the Medieval period is the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], which was embroidered with [[wool]] and is 230 feet long. Its images narrate the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman Conquest of England]]. The Bayeux Tapestry may have been created in either a commercial workshop by a royal or an aristocratic lady and her retinue, or in a workshop in a nunnery. In the 14th century, a royal workshop is documented, based at the [[Tower of London]], and there may have been other earlier arrangements. Manuscript illumination affords us many of the named artists of the Medieval Period including [[Ende (artist)|Ende]], a 10th-century Spanish nun; [[Guda]], a 12th-century German nun; and [[Claricia]], a 12th-century laywoman in a Bavarian scriptorium. These women, and many more unnamed illuminators, benefited from the nature of convents as the major loci of learning for women in the period and the most tenable option for intellectuals among them.

In many parts of Europe, with the [[Gregorian Reforms]] of the 11th century and the rise in feudalism, women faced many strictures that they did not face in the Early Medieval period. With these societal changes, the status of the convent changed. In the British Isles, the Norman Conquest marked the beginning of the gradual decline of the convent as a seat of learning and a place where women could gain power. Convents were made subsidiary to male abbots, rather than being headed by an abbess, as they had been previously. In Pagan [[Scandinavia]] (in Sweden) the only historically confirmed female [[runemaster]], [[Gunnborga]], worked in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Upplands runinskrifter 1, s. 307 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, however, under the [[Ottonian Dynasty]], convents retained their position as institutions of learning. This might be partially because convents were often headed and populated by unmarried women from royal and aristocratic families. Therefore, the greatest late Medieval period work by women originates in Germany, as exemplified by that of [[Herrade of Landsberg]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]]. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098–1179) is a particularly fine example of a German Medieval intellectual and artist. She wrote ''The Divine Works of a Simple Man'', ''The Meritorious Life'', sixty-five hymns, a miracle play, and a long treatise of nine books on the different natures of trees, plants, animals, birds, fish, minerals, and metals. From an early age, she claimed to have visions. When the Papacy supported these claims by the headmistress, her position as an important intellectual was galvanized. The visions became part of one of her seminal works in 1142, ''[[Scivias]]'' ''(Know the Ways of the Lord)'', which consists of thirty-five visions relating and illustrating the history of salvation. The illustrations in the ''[[Scivias]]'', as exemplified in the first illustration, depict Hildegarde experiencing visions while seated in the monastery at [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]. They differ greatly from others created in Germany during the same period, as they are characterized by bright colors, emphasis on line, and simplified forms. While Hildegard likely did not pen the images, their idiosyncratic nature leads one to believe they were created under her close supervision.

The 12th century saw the rise of the city in Europe, along with the rise in trade, travel, and universities. These changes in society also engendered changes in the lives of women. Women were allowed to head their husbands' businesses if they were widowed. The [[Wife of Bath]] in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is one such case. During this time, women also were allowed to be part of some artisan [[guild]]s. Guild records show that women were particularly active in the textile industries in Flanders and Northern France. Medieval manuscripts have many marginalia depicting women with spindles. In England, women were responsible for creating ''Opus Anglicanum'', or rich embroideries for ecclesiastical or secular use on clothes and various types of hangings. Women also became more active in illumination. A number of women likely worked alongside their husbands or fathers, including the daughter of [[Maître Honoré]] and the daughter of [[Jean le Noir (illuminator)|Jean le Noir]]. By the 13th century most [[illuminated manuscript]]s were being produced by commercial workshops, and by the end of the Middle Ages, when production of manuscripts had become an important industry in certain centres, women seem to have represented a majority of the artists and scribes employed, especially in Paris. The movement to [[printing]], and of book illustration to the [[printmaking]] techniques of [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]], where women seem to have been little involved, represented a setback to the progress of women artists.

This is the first period in Western history in which a number of secular female artists gained international reputations. The rise in women artists during this period may be attributed to major cultural shifts. One such shift was a move toward [[humanism]], a philosophy affirming the dignity of all people, that became central to Renaissance thinking and helped raise the status of women. In addition, the identity of the individual artist in general was regarded as more important; significant artists from this period whose identities are unknown virtually cease to exist. Two important texts, ''On Famous Women'' and ''The City of Women'', illustrate this cultural change. [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], a 14th-century humanist, wrote ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' (Latin for ''[[On Famous Women]]'') (1335–59), a collection of biographies of women. Among the 104 biographies he included was that of [[Thamar]] (or Thmyris), an ancient Greek vase painter. Curiously, among the 15th-century manuscript illuminations of ''On Famous Women'', Thamar was depicted painting a self-portrait or perhaps painting a small image of the Virgin and Child. [[Christine de Pizan]], a remarkable late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, wrote ''[[Book of the City of Ladies]]'' in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as [[Anastasia (artist)|Anastasia]], who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women.

The most notable of these was ''[[Il Cortegiano]]'' or ''[[The Courtier]]'' by 16th-century Italian humanist [[Baldassare Castiglione]]. This enormously popular work stated that men and women should be educated in the social arts. His influence made it acceptable for women to engage in the visual, musical, and literary arts. Thanks to Castiglione, this was the first period of renaissance history in which noblewomen were able to study painting. [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] was the most successful of these minor aristocrats who first benefited from humanist education and then went on to recognition as painters.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt; Artists who were not noblewomen were affected by the rise in humanism as well. In addition to conventional subject matter, artists such as [[Lavinia Fontana]] and [[Caterina van Hemessen]] began to depict themselves in self-portraits, not just as painters but also as musicians and scholars, thereby highlighting their well-rounded education. Along with the rise in humanism, there was a shift from craftsmen to artists. Artists, unlike earlier craftsmen, were now expected to have knowledge of perspective, mathematics, ancient art, and study of the human body. In the late Renaissance the training of artists began to move from the master's workshop to the [[Academic art|Academy]], and women began a long struggle, not resolved until the late 19th century, to gain full access to this training. Study of the human body required working from male nudes and corpses. This was considered essential background for creating realistic group scenes. Women were generally barred from training from male nudes, and therefore they were precluded from creating such scenes. Such depictions of nudes were required for the large-scale religious compositions, which received the most prestigious commissions.

Although many aristocratic women had access to some training in art, though without the benefit of figure drawing from nude male models, most of those women chose marriage over a career in art. This was true, for example, of two of Sofonisba Anguissola's sisters. The women recognized as artists in this period were either nuns or children of painters. Of the few who emerged as Italian artists in the 15th century, those known today are associated with convents. These artists who were nuns include [[Caterina dei Virgi]], [[Antonia Uccello]], and [[Suor Barbara Ragnoni]]. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the vast majority of women who gained any modicum of success as artists were the children of painters. This is likely because they were able to gain training in their fathers' workshops. Examples of women artists who were trained by their fathers include the painter [[Lavinia Fontana]], the miniature portraitist [[Levina Teerlinc]], and the portrait painter [[Caterina van Hemessen]]. Italian women artists during this period, even those trained by their family, seem somewhat unusual. However, in certain parts of Europe, particularly northern France and Flanders, it was more common for children of both genders to enter into their father's profession. In fact, in the Low Countries where women had more freedom, there were a number of artists in the Renaissance who were women. For example, the records of the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] in [[Bruges]] show not only that they admit women as practicing members, but also that by the 1480s twenty-five percent of its members were women (many probably working as manuscript illuminators).

Artists from the [[Baroque]] era include: [[Mary Beale]], [[Élisabeth Sophie Chéron]], [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Katharina Pepijn]], [[Catharina Peeters]], [[Johanna Vergouwen]], [[Isabel de Cisneros]], [[Giovanna Garzoni]]&lt;ref name="3 women artists in Italy"&gt;[http://www.lifeinitaly.com/art/women-artist-3.asp 3 women artists in Italy] Retrieved June 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Judith Leyster]], [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], [[Louise Moillon]], [[Josefa de Óbidos|Josefa de Ayala]] better known as Josefa de Óbidos, [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], [[Van de Passe family|Magdalena de Passe]], [[Clara Peeters]], Maria Virginia Borghese (daughter of art collector [[Olimpia Aldobrandini]]),&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Sheila, [http://www.medici.org/highlights/canvas-commoners Canvas is for Commoners], Highlights from the Mediceo del Principato, medici.org, 2008-3-20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luisa Roldán]] known as La Roldana, [[Rachel Ruysch]], [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Anna Maria van Thielen]], [[Francisca-Catherina van Thielen]] and [[Elisabetta Sirani]]. As in the Renaissance Period, many women among the Baroque artists came from artist families. [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] is an excellent example of this. She was trained by her father, [[Orazio Gentileschi]], and she worked alongside him on many of his commissions. [[Luisa Roldán]] was trained in her father's ([[Pedro Roldán]]) sculpture workshop.

Women artists in this period began to change the way women were depicted in art. Many of the women working as artists in the Baroque era were not able to train from nude models, who were always male, but they were very familiar with the female body. Women such as [[Elisabetta Sirani]] created images of women as conscious beings rather than detached muses.  One of the best examples of this novel expression is in Artemesia Gentileschi's ''Judith beheading Holofernes'', in which Judith is depicted as a strong woman determining her own destiny. While other artists, including [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and the more traditional woman, [[Fede Galizia]], depicted the same scene with a passive Judith, in her novel treatment, Gentileschi's Judith appears to be an able actor in the task at hand. Action is the essence of it and another painting by her of Judith leaving the scene. [[Still life]] emerged as an important genre around 1600, particularly in the Netherlands. Women were at the forefront of this painting trend. This genre was particularly suited to women, as they could access the materials for still life readily. In the North, these practitioners included [[Clara Peeters]], a painter of ''banketje'' or breakfast pieces, and scenes of arranged luxury goods; [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], the internationally renowned flower painter; and [[Rachel Ruysch]], a painter of visually charged flower arrangements. In other regions, still life was less common, but there were important women artists in the genre including [[Giovanna Garzoni]], who created realistic vegetable arrangements on parchment, and [[Louise Moillon]], whose fruit still life paintings were noted for their brilliant colors.

In many countries of Europe, the Academies were the arbiters of style.  The Academies also were responsible for training artists, exhibiting artwork, and, inadvertently or not, promoting the sale of art. Most Academies were not open to women. In France, for example, the powerful Academy in Paris had 450 members between the 17th century and the French Revolution, and only fifteen were women. Of those, most were daughters or wives of members. In the late 18th century, the French Academy resolved not to admit any women at all. The pinnacle of painting during the period was [[history painting]], especially large scale compositions with groups of figures depicting historical or mythical situations. In preparation to create such paintings, artists studied casts of antique sculptures and drew from male nudes. Women had limited, or no access to this Academic learning, and as such there are no extant large-scale history paintings by women from this period. Some women made their name in other genres such as portraiture. [[Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun]] used her experience in portraiture to create an allegorical scene, ''Peace Bringing Back Plenty'', which she classified as a history painting and used as her grounds for admittance into the Academy. After the display of her work, it was demanded that she attend formal classes, or lose her license to paint.  She became a court favourite, and a celebrity, who painted over forty self-portraits, which she was able to sell.&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;Heller, Nancy G., ''Women Artists: An Illustrated History'', Abbeville Press, Publishers, New York 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-89659-748-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, two women, [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Mary Moser]], were founding members of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London in 1768.  Kauffmann helped [[Maria Cosway]] enter the Academy. Although Cosway went on to gain success as a painter of mythological scenes, both women remained in a somewhat ambivalent position at the Royal Academy, as evidenced by the group portrait of ''The Academicians of the Royal Academy'' by Johan Zoffany now in The [[Royal Collection]]. In it, only the men of the Academy are assembled in a large artist studio, together with nude male models. For reasons of decorum given the nude models, the two women are not shown as present, but as portraits on the wall instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?object=400747| title = The Royal Academicians| last = Zoffany| first = Johan| authorlink = Johann Zoffany| year = 1771–1772| work = | publisher = [[Royal Collection|The Royal Collection]]|accessdate = March 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis in [[Academic art]] on studies of the nude during training remained a considerable barrier for women studying art until the 20th century, both in terms of actual access to the classes and in terms of family and social attitudes to middle-class women becoming artists.  After these three, no woman became a full member of the Academy until [[Laura Knight]] in 1936, and women were not admitted to the Academy's schools until 1861. By the late 18th century, there were important steps forward for artists who were women. In Paris, the Salon, the exhibition of work founded by the Academy, became open to non-Academic painters in 1791, allowing women to showcase their work in the prestigious annual exhibition. Additionally, women were more frequently being accepted as students by famous artists such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]].

==19th century==

=== Painters === 

Women artists of the early part of the 19th century include [[Marie-Denise Villers]], who specialized in portraiture; [[Constance Mayer]], who painted portraits and allegories; [[Marie Ellenrieder]], who was noted mainly for her religious paintings in the [[Nazarenes (artists)|Nazarene]] style.

In the second half of the century, [[Emma Sandys]], [[Marie Spartali Stillman]], [[Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale]], and [[Maria Zambaco]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~androom/biography/p012261.htm Maria Zambaco] Retrieved June 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; were women artists of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement. Also influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites were [[Evelyn De Morgan]] and the activist and painter [[Barbara Bodichon]].

Impressionist painters [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Marie Bracquemond]], and the [[United States|Americans]], [[Mary Cassatt]] and [[Lucy Bacon]], became involved in the French [[Impressionist]] movement of the 1860s and 1870s. American Impressionist [[Lilla Cabot Perry]] was influenced by her studies with [[Monet]] and by [[Japanese art]] in the late 19th century. [[Cecilia Beaux]] was an American portrait painter who also studied in France. [[Olga Boznańska]] is considered the best-known of all Polish women artists, and was stylistically associated with Impressionism.  

[[Rosa Bonheur]] was the best-known female artist of her time, internationally renowned for her paintings of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Elizabeth Weed (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTb9d7vZhA0C&amp;pg=PA50 The Question of Gender: Joan W. Scott's Critical Feminism]''. Indiana University Press. p. 50. {{ISBN|0253223245}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Thompson]] (Lady Butler), perhaps inspired by her life-classes of armoured figures at the [[Royal College of Art|Government School]], was one of the first women to become famous for large history paintings, specializing in scenes of military action, usually with many horses, most famously ''[[Scotland Forever!]]'', showing a cavalry charge at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].

[[Kitty Lange Kielland]] was a Norwegian landscape painter.

[[Elizabeth Jane Gardner]] was an American academic painter who was the first American woman to exhibit at the [[Paris Salon]]. In 1872 she became the first woman to ever win a gold medal at the Salon. 

In 1894, [[Suzanne Valadon]] was the first woman admitted to the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] in France. [[Anna Boch]] was a [[post-impressionist]] painter, as was [[Laura Muntz Lyall]], who exhibited at the 1893 [[World Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and then in 1894 as part of the [[Société des artistes français]] in Paris. 

===Photography===

[[Julia Margaret Cameron]] and [[Gertrude Kasebier]] became well known in the new medium of [[photography]], where there were no traditional restrictions, and no established training, to hold them back. 

=== Sculpture ===
[[Camille Claudel]], [[Edmonia Lewis]] and [[Enid Yandell]].

In the late 19th century, [[Edmonia Lewis]], an [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]]-[[Ojibwe]]-[[Haitian Americans|Haitian American]] artist from New York began her art studies at [[Oberlin College]]. Her sculpting career began in 1863. She established a studio in [[Rome, Italy]] and exhibited her marble sculptures through Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmonialewis.com/chronology.htm "Biography – Chronology of Mary Edmonia Lewis."] ''Edmonia Lewis.''

===Female education in the 19th century===

During the century, access to academies and formal art training expanded more for women in Europe and North America. The British Government School of Design, which later became the [[Royal College of Art]], admitted women from its founding in 1837, but only into a "Female School" which was treated somewhat differently, with "life"- classes consisting for several years of drawing a man wearing a suit of armour. 

The Royal Academy Schools finally admitted women beginning in 1861, but students drew initially only draped models. However, other schools in London, including the [[Slade School of Art]] from the 1870s, were more liberal.  By the end of the century women were able to study the naked, or very nearly naked, figure in many Western European and North American cities. The Society of Female Artists (now called ''The [[Society of Women Artists]]'') was established in 1855 in London and has staged annual exhibitions since 1857, when 358 works were shown by 149 women, some using a pseudonym.&lt;ref name=society&gt;[http://www.society-women-artists.org.uk/History.html "History"], ''The Society of Women Artists''.

[[Hilma af Klint]] (1862–1944) was a pioneer abstract painter, working long before her abstract expressionist male counterparts. She was Swedish and regularly exhibited her paintings dealing with realism, but the abstract works were not shown until 20 years after her death, at her request. She considered herself to be a spiritualist and mystic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuchman|first1=Maurice|title=The Spiritual in Art: Abstract Painting, 1890–1985|publisher=Abbeville Pr|isbn=0896596699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]] (1865–1933) was a Scottish artist whose works helped define the "Glasgow Style" of the 1890s and early 20th century. She often collaborated with her husband, the architect and designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], in works that had influence in Europe. She exhibited with Mackintosh at the 1900 [[Vienna Secession]], where her work is thought to have had an influence on the Secessionists such as [[Gustav Klimt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.org/features/item/margaret-macdonald|title=Margaret Macdonald|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]] (1878–1962) was an early American modernist in New York City.

Among the other women artists prominent in the [[Russian avant-garde]] were [[Natalia Goncharova]], [[Varvara Stepanova]] and [[Nadezhda Udaltsova]]. [[Sonia Delaunay]] and her husband were the founders of [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].

[[Dorothea Lange]] documented the Depression. [[Margaret Bourke-White]] created the industrial photographs that were featured on the cover and in the lead article of the first ''Life Magazine''. [[Diane Arbus]] based her photography on outsiders to mainstream society. [[Graciela Iturbide]]'s works dealt with Mexican life and feminism, while [[Tina Modotti]] produced "revolutionary icons" from [[Mexico]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Sarah M., ''Tina Modootti: Photographs'', Harry N.

Mary Carroll Nelson founded the [[Society of Layerists in MultiMedia|Society of Layerists in Multi-Media]] (SLMM), whose artist members follow in the tradition of [[Emil Bisttram]] and the Transcendental Painting Group, as well as [[Morris Graves]] of the Pacific Northwest Visionary Art School. In the 1970s, [[Judy Chicago]] created ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', a very important work of [[feminist art]]. [[Helen Frankenthaler]] was an [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] painter and she was influenced by [[Jackson Pollock]]. [[Lee Krasner]] was also an [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] artist and married to Pollock and a student of [[Hans Hofmann]]. [[Elaine de Kooning]] was a student and later the wife of [[Willem de Kooning]], she was an [[New York Figurative Expressionism|abstract figurative painter]]. [[Anne Ryan]] was a collagist. [[Jane Frank]], also a student of [[Hans Hofmann]], worked with [[mixed media]] on canvas. In Canada, [[Marcelle Ferron]] was an exponent of [[Les Automatistes|automatism]].

From the 1960s on, [[feminism]] led to a great increase in interest in women artists and their academic study. Notable contributions have been made by the [[art historian]]s [[Germaine Greer]], [[Linda Nochlin]], [[Griselda Pollock]] and others. Some [[art historian]]s such as [[Daphne Haldin]] have attempted to redress the balance of male-focused histories by compiling lists of women artists, though many of these efforts remain unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Drummond Charig | first= Frankie | date= 4 April 2016 | title= Daphne Haldin’s Archive and the 'Dictionary of Women Artists' | url=  http://www.britishartstudies.ac.uk/issues/issue-index/issue-2/still-invisible#018 | journal= British Art Studies | publisher= [[Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art]] and [[Yale Center for British Art]] | issue= 2 | doi=10.17658/issn.2058-5462/issue-02/still-invisible/018 | access-date=  28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures like Artemesia Gentileschi and Frida Kahlo emerged from relative obscurity to become feminist [[cultural icon|icons]]. The [[Guerilla Girls]], an anonymous group of females formed in 1985, were "the conscience of the art world." They spoke out about indifference and inequalities for gender and race, particularly in the art world. The Guerilla Girls have made many posters as a way of bringing attention, typically in a humorous way, to the community to raise awareness and create change. In 1996, [[Catherine de Zegher]] curated an exhibition of 37 great women artists from the twentieth century. The exhibition, ''Inside the Visible'', that travelled from the ICA in Boston to the National Museum for Women in the Arts in Washington, the Whitechapel in London and the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, included artists' works from the 1930s through the 1990s featuring [[Claude Cahun]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Charlotte Salomon]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Nancy Spero]], [[Francesca Woodman]], [[Lygia Clark]] and [[Mona Hatoum]] among others.

In 1993, [[Rachel Whiteread]] was the first woman to win the [[Tate]] Gallery's [[Turner Prize]]. [[Gillian Wearing]] won the prize in 1997, when there was an all-woman shortlist, the other nominees being [[Christine Borland]], [[Angela Bulloch]] and [[Cornelia Parker]]. In 1999, [[Tracey Emin]] gained considerable media coverage for her entry ''[[My Bed]]'', but did not win. In 2006 the prize was awarded to abstract painter, [[Tomma Abts]]. In 2001, a conference called "Women Artists at the Millennium" was organized at [[Princeton University]]. A book by that name was published in 2006, featuring major art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]] analysing prominent women artists such as [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Sally Mann]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Rachel Whiteread]] and [[Rosemarie Trockel]]. Internationally prominent [[contemporary artists]] who are women also include [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]], [[Marina Abramović]], [[Jaroslava Brychtova]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Lee Bul]], [[Sophie Calle]], [[Janet Cardiff]], [[Li Chevalier]], [[Marlene Dumas]], [[Marisol Escobar]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Runa Islam]], [[Chantal Joffe]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Karen Kilimnik]], [[Sarah Lucas]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Jenny Saville]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Shazia Sikander]], [[Lorna Simpson]], [[Lisa Steele]], [[Stella Vine]], [[Kara Walker]], [[Rebecca Warren]], [[Bettina Werner]] and [[Susan Dorothea White]]. &lt;!--DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST--&gt;

[[Japan]]ese artist [[Yayoi Kusama]]'s paintings, collages, soft sculptures, performance art and environmental installations all share an obsession with repetition, pattern, and accumulation. Her work shows some attributes of [[feminism]], [[minimalism]], [[surrealism]], [[Outsider Art|Art Brut]], [[pop art]], and [[abstract expressionism]], and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She describes herself as an "obsessive artist". In November 2008, Christie's auction house New York sold her 1959 painting ''No. 2'' for $5,100,000, the record price in 2008 for a work by a living female artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/15/artmarkets | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=New York art sales: 'I knew it was too good to last' | date=2008-11-15 | first=Anthony | last=Haden-Guest}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2010–2011, [[Pompidou Centre]] in Paris presented its curators' choice of contemporary women artists in a three-volume's exhibition named ''elles@Centrepompidou''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?p=953|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212114941/http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?p=953|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-12-12|title=Communiqué présentation 3e rotation de l’exposition "elles" |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum showed works of major women artists from its own collection. 2010 saw [[Eileen Cooper]] elected as the first ever woman 'Keeper of the Royal Academy'. 1995 saw Dame [[Elizabeth Blackadder]] in the 300-year history made 'Her Majesty's painter and limber in Scotland, she was awarded the OBE in 1982.

An interesting genre of women's art is women's environmental art. As of December 2013, the [[Women Environmental Artists Directory]] listed 307 women environmental artists, such as [[Marina DeBris]], [[Vernita Nemec]] and [[Betty Beaumont]]. DeBris uses beach trash to raise awareness of beach and ocean pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=staff|title=Our Town, Central|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/-145278-ocprint--.html|publisher=Orange County Register|accessdate= December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to educate children about beach trash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OC... and Sculpture by the Sea!|url=http://www.sutherland-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/news/oc-by-the-sea|publisher=Sutherland Public School}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nemec recently used junk mail to demonstrate the complexity of modern life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vernita Nemec Segments of Endless Junkmail|url=http://artdaily.com/news/19141/Vernita-Nemec-Segments-of-Endless-Junkmail|publisher=Artdaily.org, The First Art Newspaper on the Net|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaumont has been described as a pioneer of environmental art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distinguished Alumni Awards|url=http://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/alumni-friends/distinguished-alumni-award/alumni-2006/|publisher=UC Berkeley|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses art to challenge our beliefs and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Camouflaged Cells Betty Beaumont|journal=Newfound Journal|date=Winter 2011|volume=2|issue=1|url=http://www.newfoundjournal.org/archives/volume-2/issue-1/photography-beaumont/|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misrepresentation in art history==
[[Image:Judith Leyster - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Judith Leyster]], ''Self-portrait'', 1630, [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.]]
[[Image:Villers Young Woman Drawing.jpg|thumb|[[Marie-Denise Villers]], ''Young Woman Drawing'' 1801, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
Women artists have often been mis-characterized in historical accounts, both intentionally and unintentionally; such misrepresentations have often been dictated by the socio-political mores of the given era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/19wa/hd_19wa.htm|title=Women Artists in Nineteenth-Century France – Essay – Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |first= Nicole|last=Myers|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of issues that lie behind this, including:
* Scarcity of biographical information
* Anonymity – Women artists were often most active in artistic expressions that were not typically signed. During the Early Medieval period, manuscript illumination was a pursuit of monks and nuns alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=B_qNtLc72fYC Nuns as Artists: The Visual Culture of a Medieval Convent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035602/http://books.google.com/books?id=B_qNtLc72fYC |date=2014-10-19 }}, Jeffrey F. Hamburger, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Painters' Guild]]s – In the Medieval and Renaissance periods, many women worked in the workshop system. These women worked under the auspices of a male workshop head, very often the artist's father. Until the twelfth century there is no record of a workshop headed by a woman, when a widow would be allowed to assume her husband's former position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prak|first1=Maarten R.|title=Craft Guilds in Early Modern Low Countries: Work, Power and Representation|date=2006|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=0754653390|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often [[guild]] rules forbade women from attaining the various ranks leading to master,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=ucZcPgAACAAJ Dutch Seventeenth-Century Genre Painting: Its Stylistic and Thematic Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035605/http://books.google.com/books?id=ucZcPgAACAAJ |date=2014-10-19 }}, Wayne Franits, Yale University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-300-10237-2}}, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=_v3WNI0DiKIC Dutch Painting 1600–1800] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035608/http://books.google.com/books?id=_v3WNI0DiKIC |date=2014-10-19 }} Pelican history of art, {{ISSN|0553-4755}}, Yale University Press, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; so they remained "unofficial" in their status.
* Naming Conventions – the [[Family name|convention whereby women take their husbands' last names]] impedes research on female articles, especially in cases in which a work of unknown origin was signed only with a first initial and last name. Even the simplest biographical statements may be misleading. For example, one might say that [[Jane Frank]] was born in 1918, but in reality she was [[Jane Schenthal]] at birth – Jane "Frank" didn't exist until over twenty years later.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Phoebe B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=izcwMwEACAAJ "The Sculptural Landscape of Jane Frank"]  [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/ow/3569fb46ba6eb6ea.html World Cat] ([[A.S. Barnes]]: [[South Brunswick, New Jersey]], and [[New York City|New York]], 1968) {{ISBN|1-125-32317-5}} [A second edition of this book was published in July 1969 (Yoseloff: [[London]], {{ISBN|0-498-06974-5}}; also {{ISBN|978-0-498-06974-1}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples like this create a discontinuity of identity for women artists.
* Mistaken identity and incorrect attribution – In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, work by women was often reassigned. Some unscrupulous dealers even went so far as to alter signatures, as in the case of some paintings by [[Judith Leyster]] (1630) that were reassigned to [[Frans Hals]].&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede de Groot, Cornelis. "Judith Leyster," ''Jahrbuch der Königlich Preussischen Kunstsammlungen'' vol. 14 (1893), pp. 190–198; 232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofrichter, Frima Fox. "Judith Leyster: Leading Star," ''Judith Leyster: A Dutch Master and Her World'', (Yale University, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NGA&gt;Molenaer, Judith. [http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/artist-info.1485.html?artistId=1485&amp;pageNumber=1 "Leyster, Judith, Dutch, 1609–1660,"] National Gallery of Art website. Accessed Feb. 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie-Denise Villers]] (1774–1821) was a French painter who specialized in [[portrait]]s. Villers was a student of the French painter [[Girodet]]. Villers' most famous painting, Young Woman Drawing, (1801) is displayed in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. The painting was attributed to [[Jacques-Louis David]] at one time, but was later realized to be Villers' work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5221">The '''World Dance Council Ltd''' ('''WDC'''),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dancewdc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; is a registered limited company, the legal successor to the ''International Council of Ballroom Dancing'', and was established at a meeting organised by [[Phillip J. S. Richardson]] on 22 September 1950 in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyndon Wainwright|Wainwright, Lyndon]] [1997]. ''The story of British popular dance''. International Dance Publications, Brighton. 
&lt;/ref&gt; For a period from 1996 to 2006, the WDC was known as the ''World Dance &amp; Dance Sport Council Ltd'' (WD&amp;DSC).

The primary objective, at the time of its formation, was to provide an agreed basis for holding world championships in competitive [[ballroom dance]]. That objective has been achieved. Initially consisting of nine European countries and three others, today the WDC has become the leading authority on professional dance competitions, with members in numerous countries throughout the world. Each country is allowed one vote. {{As of|2006}} there are 59 members. Its governing body, the Presidium, consists of a President and a number of Vice-Presidents, in 2014 seven Vice Presidents were elected.

WDC includes the [[Dancesport|Competitive Dance]] Committee, the [[Social Dance|Dancesation]] Committee and the a private public partnership agreement with the  WDC [[Amateur League]] (WDCAL).

== Mode of operation ==
The WDC is democratic in its operation. All major decisions are taken on the basis of one full member, one vote. The full members are (with a few exceptions) individual countries. There are some Affiliate members, such as the [[Ballroom Dancers Federation]] International. The WDC operates through a general council and two committees:

* The World Competitive Dance Committee regulates professional competitive dancing and all matters to do with competitions and their regulations.
* The Dancesation Committee deals with all matters of the dance profession that relate to the activities of Dance Schools and Dance Teachers and all other forms of dance like performing arts, hip Hop, Argenitine Tango to name but a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dancewdc.org/index.php?set_ActivMenu=95 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220028/http://www.dancewdc.org/index.php?set_ActivMenu=95 |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not regulate social dance directly: that is the business of individual organisers.
* The WDC Amateur League was founded in 2007. This regulates and designates the World and continental Amateur championships and licenses and regulates Amateur Dancing.

Each member country in the WDC has its own national organisation, such as the [[British Dance Council]], which acts as a forum for the many interested parties in that country. The national bodies decide on their delegates to the WDC. The WDC also operates a WDC National Dance Council system in certain countries, which allows a multi-member system within that NDC, fostering the co-operation of major dance organisations in these countries.

== WDC Events ==
These events are under WDC regulation, but organised in various countries each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdcdance.com/index.php/competitive-dance/calendar-wdc-world-ranking-events|title=Calendar - WDC World Ranking Events|website=www.wdcdance.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
