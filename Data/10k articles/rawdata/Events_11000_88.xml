'''''A Disappearing Number''''' is a 2007 play co-written and devised by the Théâtre de Complicité company and directed and conceived by English playwright [[Simon McBurney]]. It was inspired by the collaboration during the 1910s between two of the most remarkable pure mathematicians of the twentieth century, [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] from India, and the [[Cambridge University]] [[University don|don]] [[G.H. Hardy]].

It was a co-production between the UK-based theatre company [[Complicite]] and [[Theatre Royal, Plymouth]], and [[Ruhrfestspiele]], [[Wiener Festwochen]], and the [[Holland Festival]]. ''A Disappearing Number'' premiered in Plymouth in March 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/29033/complicite-transfer-a-disappearing-number-to|title=Complicite transfer A Disappearing Number to West End|last=Smith|first=Alistair|date=26 July 2010|work=[[The Stage]]|accessdate=9 August 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; toured internationally, and played at [[The Barbican Centre]] in Autumn 2007 and 2008&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2008/a-disappearing-number-review-at-barbican-theatre-london/&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Lincoln Center]] in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/theater/reviews/17disappear.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by [[Simon McBurney]] with music by [[Nitin Sawhney]].  The production is 110 minutes with no intermission.

The piece was co-devised and written by the cast and company. The cast in order of appearance: [[Firdous Bamji]], Saskia Reeves, David Annen, [[Paul Bhattacharjee]], Shane Shambu, Divya Kasturi and Chetna Pandya.

==Plot==
Ramanujan first attracted Hardy's attention by writing him a letter in which he proved that
:&lt;math&gt;1+2+3+\cdots = -\frac{1}{12}\ (\Re)&lt;/math&gt;

where the notation &lt;math&gt;(\Re)&lt;/math&gt; indicates a [[Ramanujan summation]].

Hardy realised that this confusing presentation of the series [[1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯]] was an application of the [[Riemann zeta function]] &lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;s=-1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus du Sautoy]], ''[[The Music of the Primes]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanujan's work became the foundation of [[string theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Polchinski | first = Joseph | authorlink = Joseph Polchinski | title = String Theory, Volume I: An Introduction to the Bosonic String | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1998 | pages = 22 | isbn = 978-0-521-63303-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play includes live ''[[tabla]]'' playing, which "morphs seductively into pure mathematics", as the ''[[Financial Times]]'' review put it, "especially when … its rhythms shade into chants of number sequences reminiscent of the libretto to [[Philip Glass]]'s ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]''. One can hear the beauty of the sequences without grasping the rules that govern them."

The play has two strands of narrative and presents strong visual and [[physical theatre]]. It interweaves the passionate intellectual relationship between Hardy and the more intuitive Ramanujan, with the present-day story of Ruth, an English maths lecturer, and her husband, a globe-trotting Indian-American businessman "to illuminate the beauty and the patterns — the mystery — of mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128513493 Jeff Lunden, "'A Disappearing Number': A Vivid Theatrical Equation"], ''NPR Morning Edition'', 15 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It also explores the nature and spirituality of infinity, and explores several aspects of the Indian [[diaspora]].

Ruth travels to India in Ramanujan's footsteps and eventually dies. Al follows, to get closer to her ghost. Meanwhile, 100 years previously, Ramanujan is travelling in the opposite direction, making the trip to England, where he works with Hardy on maths and contracts tuberculosis. [[Partition (number theory)|Partition]] (as a maths concept) is explored, and diverging and converging series in mathematics become a metaphor for the Indian [[diaspora]].

[[File:US-Huey-helicopter-spraying-Agent-Orange-in-Vietnam.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[U.S. Army]] [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|Huey helicopter]] spraying Agent Orange over agricultural land during the [[Vietnam War]]]]

'''Agent Orange''' is an [[herbicide]] and [[defoliant]] chemical, one of the "tactical use" [[Rainbow Herbicides]]. It is widely known for its use by the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] as part of its [[herbicidal warfare]] program, [[Operation Ranch Hand]],&lt;ref name="Buckingham"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100928-054.pdf |title=The Air Force and Herbicides |last=Buckingham |publisher=AFHSO}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Vietnam War]] from 1961 to 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science20.com/news_articles/agent_orange_linked_skin_cancer_risk-128602 |title=Agent Orange Linked To Skin Cancer Risk |date=January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a mixture of equal parts of two herbicides, [[2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4,5-T]] and [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4-D]]. In addition to its damaging environmental effects, traces of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxin]] (mainly [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]], the most toxic of its type)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/agent-orange-and-cancer.html Agent Orange and Cancer], ''American Cancer Society''&lt;/ref&gt; found in the mixture have caused major health problems for many individuals who were exposed.

Up to four million people in [[Vietnam]] were exposed to the defoliant. The government of Vietnam says as many as 3 million people have suffered illnesses because of Agent Orange.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/14/AR2007061401077_4.html|title=Agent Orange Still Haunts Vietnam, US|date=2007-06-14|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Red Cross of Vietnam]] estimates that up to 1 million people are disabled or have health problems as a result of Agent Orange contamination.&lt;ref name="Jessica King"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/10/world/asia/vietnam-us-agent-orange/ |title=U.S. in first effort to clean up Agent Orange in Vietnam |author=Jessica King |date=2012-08-10|accessdate= 2012-08-11|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government has challenged these figures as being unreliable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"Defoliation" entry in {{cite book|editor-last=Tucker|editor-first=Spencer C.|title=The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-961-0|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical is capable of [[Mutagen|damaging]] [[gene]]s, resulting in deformities among the offspring of exposed victims. The U.S. government has documented higher cases of [[leukemia]], [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], and various kinds of [[cancer]] in exposed veterans. Agent Orange also caused enormous environmental damage in Vietnam. Over 3,100,000 hectares (31,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 11,969&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of [[forest]] were defoliated. Defoliants eroded tree cover and seedling forest stock, making [[reforestation]] difficult in numerous areas. Animal [[species diversity]] sharply reduced in contrast with unsprayed areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The aftermath of the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam resulted in massive legal consequences. The [[United Nations]] ratified [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 31/72]] and the [[Environmental Modification Convention]]. Lawsuits filed on behalf of both US and Vietnamese veterans sought compensation for damages.

Agent Orange was to a lesser extent used outside Vietnam. Land in neighbouring [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] was also sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War because forests on the border with Vietnam were used by the [[Vietcong]]. Some countries, such as [[Canada]], saw testing, while other countries, such as [[Brazil]], used the herbicide to clear out sections of land for agriculture.

==Chemical composition==
[[File:2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo(b,e)(1,4)dioxine 200.svg|thumb|[[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin]] (TCDD)]]
[[File:2,4-D.svg|thumb|[[2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D)]]
[[File:2,4,5-T.svg|thumb|[[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T)]]

The active ingredient of Agent Orange was an equal mixture of two [[phenoxy herbicide]]s – [[2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D) and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T) – in [[ester|iso-octyl ester]] form, which contained traces of the [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxin]] [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-''p''-dioxin]] (TCDD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Institute of Medicine |author2=Committee to Review the Health Effects in Vietnam Veterans of Exposure to Herbicides |title=Veterans and Agent Orange: Health Effects of Herbicides Used in Vietnam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YQTHJlt5l4C&amp;pg=PA90 |year=1994 |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=978-0-309-04887-3 |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TCDD was a trace (typically 2-3 ppm, but ranging from 50 ppb to 50 ppm),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Young AL, Thalken CE, Arnold EL, Cupello JM, Cockerham LG |title=Fate of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-''p''-dioxin (TCDD) in the Environment: Summary and Decontamination Recommendations |url=https://www.nap.edu/read/13166/chapter/5 |year=1976 |publisher=U.S. Air Force Academy. USAFA TR 76 18 |access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but significant contaminant of Agent Orange. TCDD is the most toxic of the dioxins, and is classified as a human carcinogen by the US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/text_version/chemicals.php?id=12 |title=Tox Town – Dioxins – Toxic chemicals and environmental health risks where you live and work |website=toxtown.nlm.nih.gov |access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If not bound chemically to a biological surface such as soil, leaves or grass, Agent Orange dries quickly after spraying and breaks down within hours to days when exposed to sunlight and is no longer harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/basics.asp |title=Facts About Herbicides – Public Health |publisher=US Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration |access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxicology===
Due to its fat-soluble nature, TCDD enters the body through physical contact or ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yonemoto, Junzo |title=The Effects of Dioxin on Reproduction and Development |journal=Industrial Health |volume=28 |date=2000 |pages=259–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dioxin easily accumulates in the food chain. Dioxin enters the body by attaching to a protein called the [[aryl hydrocarbon receptor]] (AhR), a transcription factor. When TCDD binds to AhR, the protein moves to the nucleus, where it influences gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ngo, Anh Duc; Taylor, Richard; Roberts, Christine L. |title=Association Between Agent Orange and Birth Defects: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |date=2006 |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=1220–1230|doi=10.1093/ije/dyl038 |pmid=16543362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Palmer, Michael |title=The Case of Agent Orange |journal=Contemporary Southeast Asia |date=2007 |volume=29 |pages=172–195 |doi=10.1355/cs29-1h}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Several herbicides were discovered as part of efforts by the USA and the British to develop herbicidal weapons for use during [[World War II]]. These included [[2,4-D]] (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), [[2,4,5-T]] (coded LN-14, and also known as trioxone), [[MCPA]] (2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, 1414B and 1414A, recoded LN-8 and LN-32), and [[isopropyl phenylcarbamate]] (1313, recoded LN-33).&lt;ref name="FAB"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Perera, Judith |author2=Thomas, Andy |date=April 18, 1985 |title=This horrible natural experiment |journal=New Scientist |pages=34–36 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=q7v_rDK0uOgC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=this+horrible+natural+experiment+Perera+Thomas#v=onepage&amp;q=this%20horrible%20natural%20experiment%20Perera%20Thomas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, the [[U.S. Department of the Army]] contracted the botanist and bioethicist [[Arthur Galston]], who discovered the defoliants later used in Agent Orange, and his employer [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana]] to study the effects of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yale.edu/2008/07/18/memoriam-arthur-galston-plant-biologist-fought-use-agent-orange |title=In Memoriam: Arthur Galston, Plant Biologist, Fought Use of Agent Orange |website=Yale News |access-date=2017-03-10|date=2008-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Galston, then a graduate student at the University of Illinois, in his research and 1943 Ph.D. [[dissertation]] focused on finding a chemical means to make [[soybean]]s [[flower]] and [[fruit]] earlier.&lt;ref name="Schneider2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider |first=Brandon |date=2003 |title=Agent Orange: A deadly member of the rainbow |url=http://research.yale.edu/ysm/article.jsp?articleID=48 |journal=[[Yale Scientific]] |volume=77 |issue=2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125154522/http://research.yale.edu/ysm/article.jsp?articleID=48 |archivedate=2009-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered both that 2,3,5-[[triiodobenzoic acid]] (TIBA) would speed up the flowering of soybeans and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans.&lt;ref name="Schneider2003" /&gt; From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. Army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the [[Bushnell Army Airfield]] in [[Florida]]. As a result, the U.S. began a full-scale production of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and would have used it against Japan in 1946 during [[Operation Downfall]] if the war had continued.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p. 111"&gt;Verwey, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the war, the relationship between the two countries was well established. In the years after the war, the U.S. tested 1,100 compounds, and field trials of the more promising ones were done at British stations in India and Australia, in order to establish their effects in tropical conditions, as well as at the U.S.'s testing ground in Florida.&lt;ref name="FAB"/&gt;

Between 1950 and 1952, trials were conducted in [[Tanganyika]], at [[Kikore]] and Stunyansa, to test arboricides and defoliants under tropical conditions. The chemicals involved were 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and [[endothall]] (3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid). During 1952–53, the unit supervised the aerial spraying of 2,4,5-T over the Waturi peninsula in Kenya to assess the value of defoliants in the eradication of [[tsetse fly]].&lt;ref name="FAB"/&gt;

== Early use ==
During the [[Malayan Emergency]] (1948–1960), Britain was the first nation to employ the use of [[herbicide]]s and [[defoliant]]s to destroy bushes, trees, and vegetation to deprive insurgents of concealment and targeting food crops as part of a starvation campaign in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/us/agent-oranges-long-legacy-for-vietnam-and-veterans.html |title=Agent Orange’s Long Legacy, for Vietnam and Veterans |last=Haberman |first=Clyde |date=2014-05-11 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed account of how the British experimented with the spraying of herbicides was written by two scientists, E.K. Woodford of [[Agricultural and Food Research Council|Agricultural Research Council]]'s Unit of Experimental Agronomy and H.G.H. Kearns of the [[University of Bristol]].&lt;ref name="FAB"/&gt;

After the Malayan conflict ended in 1960, the U.S. considered the British precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a [[laws of war|legal tactic of warfare]]. [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] advised [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] that the British had established a precedent for warfare with herbicides in Malaya.&lt;ref name="MAY"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Global Politics of Pesticides: Forging Consensus from Conflicting Interests |page=61 |author=Bruce Cumings |year=1998 |publisher=[[Earthscan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in the Vietnam War==
[[File:Aerial-herbicide-spray-missions-in-Southern-Vietnam--1965-1971.jpg|thumb|Map showing locations of U.S. Army aerial herbicide spray missions in South Vietnam taking place from 1965 to 1971.]]

In mid-1961, President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] of South Vietnam asked the United States to conduct aerial herbicide spraying in his country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Operation Ranch Hand: The Air Force and Herbicides in Southeast Asia, 1961-1971|last=Buckingham|first=William|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=1982|isbn=978-1453821824|location=|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August of that year, the [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] conducted herbicide operations with American help. But Diem's request launched a policy debate in the [[White House]] and the [[State Department|State]] and [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Departments]]. However, U.S. officials considered using it, pointing out that the British had already used herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s. In November 1961, [[U.S. President|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] authorized the start of [[Operation Ranch Hand]], the codename for the [[U.S. Air Force]]'s herbicide program in Vietnam.

During the Vietnam War, between 1962 and 1971, the United States military sprayed nearly {{convert|20000000|U.S.gal|m3}} of various chemicals – the "[[rainbow herbicides]]" and defoliants – in Vietnam, eastern Laos, and parts of Cambodia as part of the aerial defoliation program known as [[Operation Ranch Hand]], reaching its peak from 1967 to 1969. For comparison purposes, an olympic size pool holds approximately {{cvt|660000|U.S.gal|m3}}.&lt;ref&gt;"pellow-2007-159"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stellman-2003-681-687"&gt;"stellman-2003-681-687"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Clyde |last = Haberman |title = Agent Orange's Long Legacy, for Vietnam and Veterans|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/us/agent-oranges-long-legacy-for-vietnam-and-veterans.html |newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2014-05-11|access-date = 2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the British did in Malaya, the goal of the US was to defoliate rural/forested land, depriving guerrillas of food and concealment and clearing sensitive areas such as around base perimeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Tucker, Spencer |work=Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: Political, Social and Military History |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=1997 |title=Agent Orange |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was also a part of a general policy of [[forced draft urbanization]], which aimed to destroy the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside, forcing them to flee to the U.S.-dominated cities, depriving the guerrillas of their rural support base.&lt;ref name="stellman-2003-681-687" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kolko-144-145"&gt;"kolko-144-145"&lt;/ref&gt;

Agent Orange was usually sprayed from helicopters or from low-flying [[C-123 Provider]] aircraft, fitted with sprayers and "MC-1 Hourglass" pump systems and {{convert|1000|U.S.gal|L}} chemical tanks. Spray runs were also conducted from trucks, boats, and backpack sprayers.&lt;ref&gt;Schuck, 1987: [https://books.google.com/books?id=waTdqLYCyPMC&amp;pg=PA16 p. 16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerCauses/OtherCarcinogens/IntheWorkplace/agent-orange-and-cancer?sitearea=PED Agent Orange and Cancer], ''American Cancer Society'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2009: [https://books.google.com/books?id=1iCHpk2fZksC&amp;pg=PA26 p. 26]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first batch of herbicides was unloaded at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]] in South Vietnam, on January 9, 1962.&lt;ref name="hay-1982-p151"&gt;Hay, 1982: [https://books.google.com/books?id=V524J4zh06MC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Air Force records show at least 6,542 spraying missions took place over the course of Operation Ranch Hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jPL4wSfgan4C&amp;pg=PA143|title=Ecological Destruction, Health, and Development: Advancing Asian Paradigms|last=Furukawa|first=Hisao|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Trans Pacific Press|isbn=9781920901011|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1971, 12 percent of the total area of South Vietnam had been sprayed with defoliating chemicals, at an average concentration of 13 times the recommended [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] application rate for domestic use.&lt;ref name="sbsg-1971-p36"&gt;SBSG, 1971: [https://books.google.com/books?id=agsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36 p. 36]&lt;/ref&gt; In South Vietnam alone, an estimated 10 million [[hectares]] of agricultural land was ultimately destroyed.&lt;ref name="luong-2003-p3"&gt;Luong, 2003: [https://books.google.com/books?id=AkIhYEavBrEC&amp;pg=PA3 p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, TCDD concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered safe by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref name="fawthrop-war-against"&gt;Fawthrop, Tom; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3798581.stm "Vietnam's war against Agent Orange"], BBC News, June 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fawthrop-suffering"&gt;Fawthrop, Tom; [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/10/agentofsuffering "Agent of Suffering"], ''Guardian'', February 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign destroyed {{convert|5|e6acre|km2|sigfig=1|order=flip}} of upland and mangrove forests and thousands of square kilometres of crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/world/asia/us-moves-to-address-agent-orange-contamination-in-vietnam.html |title=U.S. Moves to Address Agent Orange Contamination in Vietnam |last=Fuller |first=Thomas |date=2012-08-09 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, more than 20% of South Vietnam's forests were sprayed at least once over a nine-year period.&lt;ref name="kolko-144-145"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verwey-113" /&gt;

In 1965, members of the [[U.S. Congress]] were told "crop destruction is understood to be the more important purpose&amp;nbsp;... but the emphasis is usually given to the jungle defoliation in public mention of the program."&lt;ref name="verwey-113"&gt;Verwey, 1977: [https://books.google.com/books?id=QgmHOdIjITsC&amp;pg=PA113 p. 113]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Military personnel]] were told they were destroying crops because they were going to be used to feed guerrillas. They later discovered nearly all of the food they had been destroying was not being produced for guerrillas; it was, in reality, only being grown to support the local civilian population. For example, in Quang Ngai province, 85% of the crop lands were scheduled to be destroyed in 1970 alone. This contributed to widespread famine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people malnourished or starving.&lt;ref&gt;Verwey, 1977: [https://books.google.com/books?id=QgmHOdIjITsC&amp;pg=PA116 p. 116]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. military began targeting food crops in October 1962, primarily using [[Agent Blue]]; the American public was not made aware of the crop destruction programs until 1965 (and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring). In 1965, 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops. The first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the [[State Department]] in March 1966.&lt;ref name="p. 111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kolko-144-145"/&gt;

Many experts at the time, including [[Arthur Galston]], opposed herbicidal warfare due to concerns about the side effects to humans and the environment by indiscriminately spraying the chemical over a wide area. As early as 1966, resolutions were introduced to the [[United Nations]] charging that the U.S. was violating the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]], which regulated the use of [[chemical weapons|chemical]] and [[biological weapons]]. The U.S. defeated most of the resolutions,&lt;ref name="galston-light"&gt;Peterson, Doug [http://www.las.illinois.edu/alumni/magazine/articles/2004/galston Arthur W. Galston: Matters of Light], ''LASNews Magazine'', [[University of Illinois]], Spring 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schuck, 1987. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that Agent Orange was not a chemical or a biological weapon as it was considered a herbicide and a defoliant and it was used in effort to destroy plant crops and to deprive the enemy of concealment and not meant to target human beings. The U.S. delegation argued that a weapon, by definition, is any device used to injure, defeat, or destroy living beings, structures, or systems, and Agent Orange did not qualify under that definition. It also argued that if the U.S. were to be charged for using Agent Orange, then Britain and its Commonwealth nations should be charged since they also used it widely during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=When Technology Fails: Significant Technological Disasters, Accidents, and Failures of the Twentieth Century |year=1994 |page=104 |author=Igor Primoratz |publisher=[[Overlook Hardcover]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Britain commented on the draft Resolution 2603 (XXIV): "The evidence seems to us to be notably inadequate for the assertion that the use in war of chemical substances specifically toxic to plants is prohibited by [[international law]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_gb_rule76|title=Customary IHL –  Practice Relating to Rule 76.

==Health effects==

{{main article|Effects of Agent Orange on the Vietnamese people}}
The government of Vietnam says that 4 million of its citizens were exposed to Agent Orange, and as many as 3 million have suffered illnesses because of it; these figures include their children who were exposed.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"/&gt; The [[Red Cross of Vietnam]] estimates that up to 1 million people are disabled or have health problems due to contaminated Agent Orange.&lt;ref name="Jessica King"/&gt; The United States government has challenged these figures as being unreliable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In 2006, Anh Duc Ngo and colleagues of the [[University of Texas Health Science Center]] published a [[meta-analysis]] that exposed a large amount of heterogeneity (different findings) between studies, a finding consistent with a lack of consensus on the issue.&lt;ref name="1940-5030"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/birth-defects-caused-agent-orange|last=King|first=Jesse|title=Birth Defects Caused by Agent Orange|journal=Embryo Project Encyclopedia|date=2012-11-08|hdl=10776/4202|issn=1940-5030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, statistical analysis of the studies they examined resulted in data that the increase in birth defects/[[relative risk]] (RR) from exposure to agent orange/dioxin "appears" to be on the order of 3 in Vietnamese-funded studies, but 1.29 in the rest of the world.

====National Academy of Medicine====
Starting in the early 1990s, the federal government directed the Institute of Medicine (IOM), now known as the [[National Academy of Medicine]], to issue reports every 2 years on the health effects of Agent Orange and similar herbicides. First published in 1994 and titled Veterans and Agent Orange, the IOM reports assess the risk of both cancer and non-cancer health effects. Each health effect is categorized by evidence of association based on available research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/agent-orange-and-cancer.html | title=Agent Orange and Cancer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last update, titled Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 2014 (and published in 2016), the links between Agent Orange exposure and cancer were listed as shown. (Note that this table shows only cancers.) Other health effects are listed in the next section.)

More recent research established that veterans exposed to Agent Orange suffer more than twice the rate of highly aggressive [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usmedicine.com/agencies/department-of-veterans-affairs/agent-orange-increases-lethal-prostate-cancer-risk/ |title=Agent Orange Increases Lethal Prostate Cancer Risk |publisher=U.S. Medicine |access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, recent reports from the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences show that Agent Orange exposure also doubles the risk of invasive skin cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyle|first1=Annette M.|title=Agent Orange Exposure Appears to Double Risk of Invasive Skin Cancer |url=http://www.usmedicine.com/agencies/department-of-defense-dod/agent-orange-exposure-appears-to-double-risk-of-invasive-skin-cancer/|publisher=U.

While in Vietnam, the veterans were told not to worry, and were persuaded the chemical was harmless.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, Kenneth J.; [http://politicalaffairs.net/killing-me-softly-how-agent-orange-murders-vietnam-s-children/ "Killing Me Softly: How Agent Orange Murders Vietnam's Children"], ''Political Affairs'', April 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; After returning home, Vietnam veterans began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects might be related to Agent Orange and the other toxic herbicides to which they had been exposed in Vietnam. Veterans began to file claims in 1977 to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to Agent Orange, or more specifically, dioxin, but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43790.pdf |title=Veterans Exposed to Agent Orange: Legislative History, Litigation, and Current Issues |last=Sidath |first=Viranga Panangala |last2=Shedd |first2=Daniel |date=November 18, 2014 |website=Federation of American Scientists |publisher=Congressional Research Service |access-date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to qualify for compensation, veterans must have served on or near the perimeters of military bases in Thailand during the Vietnam Era, where herbicides were tested and stored outside of Vietnam, Veterans who were crew members on C-123 planes flown after the Vietnam War, or were associated with Department of Defense (DoD) projects to test, dispose of, or store herbicides in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/claims-postservice-agent_orange.asp|title=Veterans Exposed to Agent Orange |date=January 19, 2018 |website=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs |publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs |access-date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 1993, the Department of Veterans Affairs had compensated only 486 victims, although it had received disability claims from 39,419 soldiers who had been exposed to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fleischer |first1=Doris Zames |last2=Zames |first2=Freida |title=The disability rights movement: from charity to confrontation |publisher=Temple University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-56639-812-1 |page=178 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3t84d8tLEVcC&amp;pg=PA178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological impact==
{{see also|Environmental impact of war}}
[[File:Before and after spraying agent orange.jpg|thumb|Mangrove forests, like the top one east of Saigon, were often destroyed by herbicides.]]
About 17.8 percent—{{convert|3100000|ha|sqkm sqmi}}—of the total forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which disrupted the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, and loss of seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Furukawa, 2004: [https://books.google.com/books?id=jPL4wSfgan4C&amp;pg=PA215 p. 215]&lt;/ref&gt; Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as [[bamboo]] and [[cogon grass]]), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species [[biodiversity|diversity]] was also impacted; in one study a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] biologist found 24 species of birds and five species of [[mammal]]s in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chiras, Daniel D.|title=Environmental science|year=2010|edition=8th|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett|isbn=978-0-7637-5925-4|page=499|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L28bHnPXo1AC&amp;pg=PA499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dioxins from Agent Orange have persisted in the Vietnamese environment since the war, settling in the soil and sediment and entering the [[food chain]] through animals and fish which feed in the contaminated areas. The movement of dioxins through the [[food web]] has resulted in [[bioconcentration]] and [[biomagnification]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vallero, Daniel A.|title=Biomedical ethics for engineers: ethics and decision making in biomedical and biosystem engineering|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-7506-8227-5|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AeT56Pi8LFYC&amp;pg=PA73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The areas most heavily contaminated with dioxins are former U.S. air bases.&lt;ref&gt;Furukawa, 2004: [https://books.google.com/books?id=jPL4wSfgan4C&amp;pg=PA221 pp. 221–222]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociopolitical impact==
American policy during the Vietnam War was to destroy crops, accepting the sociopolitical impact that that would have.&lt;ref name=Turse/&gt; The [[RAND Corporation]]'s ''Memorandum 5446-ISA/ARPA'' states: "the fact that the VC [the Vietcong] obtain most of their food from the neutral rural population dictates the destruction of civilian crops&amp;nbsp;... if they are to be hampered by the crop destruction program, it will be necessary to destroy large portions of the rural economy – probably 50% or more".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Verwey |first=Wil D. |title=Riot Control Agents and Herbicides in War: Their Humanitarian, Toxicological, Ecological, Military, Polemological, and Legal Aspects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QgmHOdIjITsC&amp;pg=PA115 |date=1977 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-286-0336-3 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crops were deliberately sprayed with Agent Orange, areas were bulldozed clear of vegetation, and the rural population was subjected to bombing and artillery fire. In consequence, the urban population in South Vietnam nearly tripled, growing from 2.8 million people in 1958 to 8 million by 1971. The rapid flow of people led to a fast-paced and uncontrolled urbanization; an estimated 1.5 million people were living in Saigon slums due to people moving to cities.&lt;ref name="pp. 4"&gt;Luong, 2003: [https://books.google.com/books?id=AkIhYEavBrEC&amp;pg=PA4 pp. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Turse&gt;{{cite book |last=Turse |first=Nick |title=Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeFK5dkYZsEC&amp;pg=PT95 |date=2013 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |isbn=978-0-8050-9547-0 |pages=95–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal and diplomatic proceedings==
=== International ===
The extensive environmental damage that resulted from usage of the herbicide prompted the [[United Nations]] to pass [[United Nations Convention on Environmental Modification|Resolution 31/72]] and ratify the [[Environmental Modification Convention]]. Many states do not regard this as a complete ban on the use of herbicides and defoliants in warfare but it does require case-by-case consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/cpmhuemt/cpmhuemt.html |title=Convention on the Prohibition of the Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques |publisher=Audiovisual Library of International Law |date=December 10, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule76 |title=Practice Relating to Rule 76.

In the [[Conference on Disarmament]], Article 2(4) Protocol III of the weaponry convention contains "The Jungle Exception", which prohibits states from attacking forests or jungles "except if such natural elements are used to cover, conceal or camouflage combatants or military objectives or are military objectives themselves". This exception voids any protection of any military and civilian personnel from a napalm attack or something like Agent Orange and is clear that it was designed to cover situations like U.S. tactics in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Detter, Ingrid |title=The Law of War |publisher=Ashgate |date=2013 |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. veterans class action lawsuit against manufacturers ===
Since at least 1978, several lawsuits have been filed against the companies which produced Agent Orange, among them [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow Chemical]], [[Monsanto Company|Monsanto]], and [[Diamond Shamrock]].&lt;ref name=EncNatSec&gt;"Agent Orange" entry in Encyclopedia of United States National Security, edited by Richard J. Samuel. SAGE Publications, 2005. {{ISBN|9781452265353}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

Attorney [[Hy Mayerson]] was an early pioneer in Agent Orange litigation, working with [[environmentalism|environmental attorney]] [[Victor Yannacone]] in 1980 on the first [[Class-action suit|class-action suits]] against wartime manufacturers of Agent Orange. In meeting Dr. [[Ronald Codario|Ronald A. Codario]], one of the first civilian doctors to see affected patients, Mayerson, so impressed by the fact a physician would show so much interest in a Vietnam veteran, forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on Agent Orange and the effects of [[dioxin]] on animals and humans to Codario's office the day after he was first contacted by the doctor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wilcox, 1983:&lt;/ref&gt; The corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Scott|first=Wilbur J.|title=The Politics of Readjustment: Vietnam Veterans Since the War|publisher=Transaction|year=1993|isbn=978-0-202-30406-9|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLg8rVfYO9EC&amp;pg=PA130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayerson, with Sgt. Charles E. Hartz as their principal client, filed the first US Agent Orange class-action lawsuit, in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1980, for the injuries military personnel in Vietnam suffered through exposure to toxic dioxins in the [[defoliant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1347&amp;dat=19800125&amp;id=ZdMSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0_oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5065,3012612 |title=''Dying Veteran May Speak From Beyond The Grave In Court: Lakeland Ledger |date=1980-01-25 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney Mayerson co-wrote the brief that certified the Agent Orange Product Liability action as a [[class action]], the largest ever filed as of its filing.&lt;ref&gt;Croft, Steve; [http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=270939 Agent Orange], ''CBS Evening News'', May 7, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Hartz's [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] was one of the first ever taken in America, and the first for an Agent Orange trial, for the purpose of preserving [[testimony]] at trial, as it was understood that Hartz would not live to see the trial because of a [[brain tumor]] that began to develop while he was a member of [[Tiger Force]], [[special forces]], and [[LRRPs]] in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayerson.com/html/about.html |title=The Mayerson Law Offices |publisher=The Mayerson Law Offices |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pottsmerc.com/ |title=Pottstown Mercury |publisher=Pottsmerc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans' lead expert, Dr. Codario, including about 100 articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade, as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed, what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans, and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The chemical companies involved denied that there was a link between Agent Orange and the veterans' medical problems. However, on May 7, 1984, seven chemical companies settled the class-action suit out of court just hours before jury selection was to begin. The companies agreed to pay $180 million as compensation if the veterans dropped all claims against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editors=Stanley, Jay; Blair, John D.|title=Challenges in military health care: perspectives on health status and the provision of care| publisher=Transaction Publishers| year=1993|isbn=978-1-56000-650-3|page=164| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8k-WIJYwIF4C&amp;pg=PA164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slightly over 45% of the sum was ordered to be paid by Monsanto alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Harrington|first=John C.|title=The challenge to power: money, investing, and democracy|publisher=Chelsea Green Publisher|year=2005|isbn=978-1-931498-97-5|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGgeiQvijI8C&amp;pg=PT260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many veterans who were victims of Agent Orange exposure were outraged the case had been settled instead of going to court, and felt they had been betrayed by the lawyers. "Fairness Hearings" were held in five major American cities, where veterans and their families discussed their reactions to the settlement, and condemned the actions of the lawyers and courts, demanding the case be heard before a jury of their peers. Federal Judge [[Jack B. Weinstein]] refused the appeals, claiming the settlement was "fair and just". By 1989, the veterans' fears were confirmed when it was decided how the money from the settlement would be paid out. A totally disabled Vietnam veteran would receive a maximum of $12,000 spread out over the course of 10 years. Furthermore, by accepting the settlement payments, disabled veterans would become ineligible for many state benefits that provided far more monetary support than the settlement, such as [[Food Stamps|food stamps]], [[public assistance]], and [[Government pension|government pensions]]. A widow of a Vietnam veteran who died of Agent Orange exposure would only receive $3700.&lt;ref name="oxford-milhist-725"&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Chambers, John Whiteclay|editor2=Anderson, Fred|title=The Oxford companion to American military history|chapter=Toxic Agents: Agent Orange Exposure|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999| isbn=978-0-19-507198-6|page=725| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Rzy_yNMKbcC&amp;pg=PA725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Monsanto spokesman Jill Montgomery said Monsanto should not be liable at all for injuries or deaths caused by Agent Orange, saying: "We are sympathetic with people who believe they have been injured and understand their concern to find the cause, but reliable scientific evidence indicates that Agent Orange is not the cause of serious long-term health effects."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Agent Orange Victims Sue Monsanto| last=Fawthrop|first=Tom| work=CorpWatch|date=November 4, 2004|url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=11638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Jersey Agent Orange Commission===
In 1980, [[New Jersey]] created the New Jersey Agent Orange Commission, the first state commission created to study its effects. The commission's research project in association with [[Rutgers University]] was called "The Pointman Project". It was disbanded by Governor [[Christine Todd Whitman]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prestin|first1=Terry|title=Agent Orange Panel Closes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/03/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-agent-orange-panel-closes.html|accessdate=13 September 2014|work=The New York Times|issue=Section B; Page 1; Column 1|date=July 3, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Pointman I, commission researchers devised ways to determine small dioxin levels in blood. Prior to this, such levels could only be found in the [[adipose tissue|adipose (fat) tissue]]. The project studied dioxin ([[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]]) levels in blood as well as in adipose tissue in a small group of Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange and compared them to those of a matched control group; the levels were found to be higher in the former group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=371123 "Dioxins and Dibenzofurans in Blood and Adipose Tissue of Agent Orange—Exposed Vietnam Veterans and Matched Controls"], ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', Vol. 259 No. 11, March 18, 1988, p. 1661–1667&lt;/ref&gt;

The second phase of the project continued to examine and compare dioxin levels in various groups of Vietnam veterans, including [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and [[Brownwater Navy|brown water riverboat Navy]] personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yyvmcMsNnB4C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=The+Pointman+Project+rutgers#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Pointman%20Project%20rutgers&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of the Veteran in America|last=Pencak|first=William|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2009|isbn=9780313087592|location=|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Congress===
In 1991, Congress enacted the [[Agent Orange Act of 1991|Agent Orange Act]], giving the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] the authority to declare certain conditions "presumptive" to exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin, making these veterans who served in Vietnam eligible to receive treatment and compensation for these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.va.gov/AgentOrange/ |title=Agent Orange – Office of Public Health and Environmental Hazards |publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs |date=2009-11-11 |accessdate=2012-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703211712/http://www1.va.gov/agentorange/ |archivedate=2012-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same law required the [[National Academy of Sciences]] to periodically review the science on dioxin and herbicides used in Vietnam to inform the [[Secretary of Veterans Affairs]] about the strength of the scientific evidence showing association between exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin and certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/laws/PL102-4.asp |title=PL 102-4 and The National Academy of Sciences |publisher=.nationalacademies.org |date=1981-11-03 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authority for the National Academy of Sciences reviews and addition of any new diseases to the presumptive list by the VA is expiring in 2015 under the sunset clause of the Agent Orange Act of 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/radiation/dir/mstreet/commeet/meet3/brief3.gfr/tab_g/br3g1f.txt |title=Agent Orange Act of 1991 |publisher=[[George Washington University]] |accessdate=2017-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201132816/http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/radiation/dir/mstreet/commeet/meet3/brief3.gfr/tab_g/br3g1f.txt |archivedate=2017-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through this process, the list of 'presumptive' conditions has grown since 1991, and currently the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has listed [[prostate cancer]], respiratory cancers, [[multiple myeloma]], [[type II diabetes mellitus]], [[Hodgkin's disease]], [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], soft tissue sarcoma, [[chloracne]], [[porphyria cutanea tarda]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], and [[spina bifida]] in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange as conditions associated with exposure to the herbicide. This list now includes B cell leukemias, such as [[hairy cell leukemia]], [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[ischemic heart disease]], these last three having been added on August 31, 2010. Several highly placed individuals in government are voicing concerns about whether some of the diseases on the list should, in fact, actually have been included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/08/31/aging_vets_costs_concern_obamas_deficit_co_chair|title=Aging vets' costs concern Obama's deficit co-chair|work=Boston.com|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2010-08-31|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, an appraisal of the 20 year long ''Air Force Health Study'' that began in 1982 indicates that the results of the AFHS as they pertain to Agent Orange, do not provide evidence of disease in the Ranch Hand veterans due to "their elevated levels of exposure to Agent Orange".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buffler|first=Patricia A.|last2=Ginevan|first2=Michael E.|last3=Mandel|first3=Jack S.|last4=Watkins|first4=Deborah K.|date=2011-09-01|title=The Air Force Health Study: An Epidemiologic Retrospective|url=http://www.annalsofepidemiology.org/article/S1047-2797(11)00048-2/abstract|journal=Annals of Epidemiology|language=English|volume=21|issue=9|pages=673–687|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2011.02.001|pmid=21441038|issn=1047-2797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VA denied the applications of post-Vietnam C-123 aircrew veterans because as veterans without "boots on the ground" service in Vietnam, they were not covered under VA's interpretation of "exposed". At the request of the VA, the [[Institute Of Medicine]] evaluated whether or not service in these C-123 aircraft could have plausibly exposed soldiers and been detrimental to their health. Their report "Post-Vietnam Dioxin Exposure in Agent Orange-Contaminated C-123 Aircraft" confirmed it.&lt;ref name=iom&gt;{{cite news|author1=Committee to Evaluate the Potential Exposure of Agent Orange/TCDD Residue and Level of Risk of Adverse Health Effects for Aircrew of Post-Vietnam C-123 Aircraft; Board on the Health of Select Populations|title=Post-Vietnam Dioxin Exposure in Agent Orange-Contaminated C-123 Aircraft|url=https://iom.nationalacademies.org/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2015/C-123/C-123%20findings.pdf|accessdate=2015-09-03|work=Institute of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015 the Secretary of Veterans Affairs issued an Interim final rule providing presumptive service connection for post-Vietnam C-123 aircrews, maintenance staff and aeromedical evacuation crews.

===U.S.–Vietnamese government negotiations===
In 2002, Vietnam and the U.S. held a joint conference on Human Health and Environmental Impacts of Agent Orange. Following the conference, the U.S. [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] (NIEHS) began scientific exchanges between the U.S. and Vietnam, and began discussions for a joint research project on the human health impacts of Agent Orange.&lt;ref name="p. 310"&gt;Young, 2009: [https://books.google.com/books?id=1iCHpk2fZksC&amp;pg=PA310 p. 310]&lt;/ref&gt;

These negotiations broke down in 2005, when neither side could agree on the research protocol and the research project was canceled. More progress has been made on the environmental front. In 2005, the first U.S.-Vietnam workshop on remediation of dioxin was held.&lt;ref name="p. 310"/&gt;

Starting in 2005, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) began to work with the Vietnamese government to measure the level of dioxin at the [[Da Nang Air Base]]. Also in 2005, the Joint Advisory Committee on Agent Orange, made up of representatives of Vietnamese and U.S. government agencies, was established. The committee has been meeting yearly to explore areas of scientific cooperation, technical assistance and [[environmental remediation]] of dioxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://vietnam.usembassy.gov/pr081209.html|title = US, Vietnam to Hold Fourth Joint Advisory Meeting on Agent Orange/Dioxin|accessdate = August 11, 2011|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111015102640/http://vietnam.usembassy.gov/pr081209.html|archivedate = October 15, 2011|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A breakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on this issue occurred as a result of United States President [[George W. Bush]]'s state visit to Vietnam in November 2006.

====Vietnamese victims class action lawsuit in U.S. courts====
On January 31, 2004, a [[victim's rights group]], the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/dioxin (VAVA), filed a lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] in [[Brooklyn]], against several U.S. companies for liability in causing personal injury, by developing, and producing the chemical, and claimed that the use of Agent Orange violated the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare]], 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]], and the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]]. Dow Chemical and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the U.S. military, and were named in the suit, along with the dozens of other companies (Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Thompson Chemicals, Hercules, etc.). On March 10, 2005, Judge [[Jack B. Weinstein]] of the Eastern District – who had presided over the 1984 U.S. veterans class-action lawsuit – dismissed the lawsuit, ruling there was no legal basis for the [[plaintiff|plaintiffs']] claims. He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under [[international law]] at the time of its use by the U.S.; the U.S. was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide; and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_us_rule76|title=Customary IHL -  Rule 76.

{{quote|The [[U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]'s [[DARPA|Advanced Research Project Agency]]'s (ARPA) [[Project AGILE]] was instrumental in the United States' development of herbicides as a military weapon, an undertaking inspired by the British use of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T to destroy jungle-grown crops and bushes during the insurgency in Malaya. The United States considered British precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a legally accepted tactic of war. On November 24, 1961, [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] advised [[U.S. President|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] that herbicide use in Vietnam would be lawful, saying that "[t]he use of defoliant does not violate any rule of international law concerning the conduct of chemical warfare and is an accepted tactic of war. Precedent has been established by the British during the emergency in Malaya in their use of helicopters for destroying crops by chemical spraying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Literary Cold War, 1945 to Vietnam |author=Adam Piette |date=May 25, 2009 |pages=201–202 |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |isbn=978-0-7486-3527-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v01/d275|title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961–1963, Volume I, Vietnam, 1961 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

George Jackson stated that "if the Americans were guilty of war crimes for using Agent Orange in Vietnam, then the British would be also guilty of war crimes as well since they were the first nation to deploy the use of herbicides and defoliants in warfare and used them on a large scale throughout the Malayan Emergency. Not only was there no outcry by other states in response to Britain's use, but the U.S. viewed it as establishing a precedent for the use of herbicides and defoliants in [[jungle warfare]]." The U.S. government was also not a party in the lawsuit, due to [[sovereign immunity]], and the court ruled the chemical companies, as contractors of the U.S. government, shared the same immunity.
The case was appealed and heard by the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[Manhattan]] on June 18, 2007. Three judges on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case. They ruled that, though the herbicides contained a dioxin (a known poison), they were not intended to be used as a poison on humans. Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision. The lawyers for the Vietnamese filed a petition to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to hear the case. On March 2, 2009, the Supreme Court denied [[certiorari]] and refused to reconsider the ruling of the Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warlegacies.org/Agent%20Orange/Appealdecision.pdf |title=February 22, 2008 Decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals re: Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange v.

In a November 2004 [[Zogby International]] poll of 987 people, 79% of respondents thought the U.S. chemical companies which produced Agent Orange defoliant should compensate U.S. soldiers who were affected by the toxic chemical used during the war in Vietnam. Also, 51% said they supported compensation for Vietnamese Agent Orange victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vietnamembassy-usa.org/relations/most-americans-favor-compensation-agent-orange-victims|title=Most Americans favor compensation for Agent Orange victims {{!}} Embassy of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in the United States|last=|first=|date=November 19, 2004|website=vietnamembassy-usa.org|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Help for those affected in Vietnam===
To assist those who have been affected by Agent Orange/dioxin, the Vietnamese have established "peace villages", which each host between 50 and 100 victims, giving them medical and psychological help. As of 2006, there were 11 such villages, thus granting some social protection to fewer than a thousand victims. U.S. veterans of the war in Vietnam and individuals who are aware and sympathetic to the impacts of Agent Orange have supported these programs in Vietnam. An international group of veterans from the U.S. and its allies during the Vietnam War working with their former enemy—veterans from the Vietnam Veterans Association—established the Vietnam Friendship Village outside of [[Hanoi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vietnamfriendship.org|title=Vietnam Friendship Village Project|accessdate=August 18, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917012142/http://www.vietnamfriendship.org/|archivedate=17 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center provides medical care, rehabilitation and vocational training for children and veterans from Vietnam who have been affected by Agent Orange. In 1998, The [[Vietnam Red Cross]] established the Vietnam Agent Orange Victims Fund to provide direct assistance to families throughout Vietnam that have been affected. In 2003, the [[Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange]] (VAVA) was formed. In addition to filing the lawsuit against the chemical companies, VAVA provides medical care, rehabilitation services and financial assistance to those injured by Agent Orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vava.org.vn/|title=Hội Nạn nhân chất độc da cam/dioxin Việt Nam|website=vava.org.vn|language=vi-VN|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese government provides small monthly stipends to more than 200,000 Vietnamese believed affected by the herbicides; this totaled $40.8 million in 2008 alone. The Vietnam Red Cross has raised more than $22 million to assist the ill or disabled, and several U.S. foundations, United Nations agencies, European governments and nongovernmental organizations have given a total of about $23 million for site cleanup, reforestation, health care and other services to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;Statement by Amb.

In 2008, Australian researcher Jean Williams claimed that cancer rates in the town of Innisfail, Queensland were 10 times higher than the state average due to secret testing of Agent Orange by the Australian military scientists during the Vietnam War. Williams, who had won the Order of Australia medal for her research on the effects of chemicals on U.S. war veterans, based her allegations on Australian government reports found in the Australian War Memorial's archives. A former soldier, Ted Bosworth, backed up the claims, saying that he had been involved in the secret testing. Neither Williams or Bosworth have produced verifiable evidence to support their claims. The Queensland health department determined that cancer rates in Innisfail were no higher than those in other parts of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=McMahon, Barbara |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/19/australia |title=Australia cancer deaths linked to Agent Orange |newspaper=The Guardian |date=May 19, 2008 |accessdate=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of chemicals present in the island's soil, together with resolutions passed by [[Legislature of Guam|Guam's legislature]], suggest that Agent Orange was among the herbicides routinely used on and around military bases [[Anderson Air Force Base]], [[Naval Air Station Agana]], [[Guam]]. Despite the evidence, the Department of Defense continues to deny that Agent Orange was ever stored or used on Guam. Several Guam veterans have collected an enormous amount of evidence to assist in their disability claims for direct exposure to dioxin containing herbicides such as 2,4,5-T which are similar to the illness associations and disability coverage that has become standard for those who were harmed by the same chemical contaminant of Agent Orange used in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Dimond2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-hero-project/articles/2013/09/25/were-vets-who-served-in-guam-exposed-to-agent-orange-and-denied-benefits.html |title=Were Vets Who Served in Guam Exposed to Agent Orange and Denied Benefits? |last1=Dimond |first1=Diane |date=September 25, 2013 |website=The Hero Project |publisher=The Daily Beast |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States local press KPHO-TV in Phoenix, Arizona, alleged (in 2011) that the United States Army had in 1978 buried 250 drums of Agent Orange in [[Camp Carroll, South Korea|Camp Carroll]], the U.S. Army base in Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpho.com/news/27892124/detail.html |title=Valley Veteran Blows Whistle On Burial Of Agent Orange |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514170728/http://www.kpho.com/news/27892124/detail.html |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |date=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, about 20,000 South Koreans filed two separated lawsuits against U.S. companies, seeking more than $5 billion in damages.

In January 2006, the South Korean Appeals Court ordered Dow Chemical and Monsanto to pay $62 million in compensation to about 6,800 people. The ruling acknowledged that "the [[defendant]]s failed to ensure safety as the defoliants manufactured by the defendants had higher levels of dioxins than standard", and, quoting the U.S. National Academy of Science report, declared that there was a "causal relationship" between Agent Orange and a range of diseases, including several cancers. The judges failed to acknowledge "the relationship between the chemical and peripheral neuropathy, the disease most widespread among Agent Orange victims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-01-26-agent-orange-damages_x.htm |title=USATODAY.com – Korea orders Agent Orange payments |website=usatoday30.usatoday.com |access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, veterans who provide evidence meeting VA requirements for service in Vietnam, and who can medically establish that anytime after this 'presumptive exposure' they developed any medical problems on the list of presumptive diseases, may receive compensation from the VA.

[[File:Ivon Watkins Dow factory, New Plymouth.jpg|thumb|The Ivon Watkins-Dow factory in [[New Plymouth]], New Zealand]]
The use of Agent Orange has been controversial in New Zealand, because of the exposure of New Zealand troops in Vietnam and because of the production of Agent Orange for Vietnam and other users at an Ivon Watkins-Dow chemical plant in Paritutu, [[New Plymouth]]. There have been continuing claims, as yet unproven, that the suburb of Paritutu has also been polluted; see [[New Zealand in the Vietnam War#Agent Orange|New Zealand in the Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/dioxin/news/article.cfm?c_id=675&amp;objectid=10412402 |title=Concern prompts review of Dioxin study |newspaper=New Zealand Herald |date=November 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are cases of New Zealand soldiers developing cancers such as bone cancer but none has been scientifically connected to exposure to herbicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rowland, R.E.; Edwards, L.A.; Podd, J.V. |title=Elevated Sister Chromatid Exchange Frequencies in New Zealand Vietnam War Veterans |journal=Cytogenetic and Genome Research |volume=116 |issue=4 |date=2007 |pages=248–251 |doi=10.1159/000100407 |pmid=17431321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Air Force]] operation to remove Herbicide Orange from Vietnam in 1972 was named [[Operation Pacer IVY]], while the operation to destroy the Agent Orange stored at [[Johnston Atoll]] in 1977 was named [[Operation Pacer HO]]. Operation Pacer IVY (InVentorY) collected Agent Orange in [[South Vietnam]] and removed it in 1972 aboard the ship {{MV|Transpacific}} for storage on Johnston Atoll.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denix.osd.mil/shf/HerbicideOrange.cfm |title=Investigations into Allegations of Herbicide Orange on Okinawa, Japan |last=Young |first=Alvin L. |publisher=Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (I &amp; E)|date=January 2013 |accessdate= March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) reports that {{cvt|1800000|U.S.gal|L|order=flip}} of Herbicide Orange was stored at Johnston Island in the Pacific and {{cvt|480000|U.S.gal|L|order=flip}} at [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]] in [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=Sierra&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/910096MY.PDF |title=Final report of the Federal Task Force for Hazardous Materials Management of the Western Federal Regional Council Region IX, August 1, 1973 to June 30, 1977 |last1=Bourns |first1=Charles T. |date=March 1, 1978 |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research and studies were initiated to find a safe method to destroy the materials and it was discovered they could be incinerated safely under special conditions of temperature and dwell time.&lt;ref name=Sierra /&gt; However, these herbicides were expensive and the Air Force wanted to resell its surplus instead of dumping it at sea.&lt;ref name="Guam" /&gt; Among many methods tested, a possibility of salvaging the herbicides by reprocessing and filtering out the [[2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin]] (TCDD) contaminant with carbonized (charcoaled) coconut fibers. This concept was then tested in 1976 and a pilot plant constructed at Gulfport.&lt;ref name=Sierra /&gt;

From July to September 1977 during [[Operation Pacer HO]] (Herbicide Orange), the entire stock of Agent Orange from both Herbicide Orange storage sites at Gulfport and Johnston Atoll was subsequently [[incinerated]] in four separate burns in the vicinity of Johnson Island aboard the Dutch-owned waste incineration ship {{ship|MT|Vulcanus}}.&lt;ref name="Guam"&gt;{{cite web |title=Phase II Environmental Baseline Survey, Johnston Atoll, Appendix B, page B19-20 |url=http://www.guamagentorange.info/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Johnston_Atoll_History.261114404.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421032235/http://www.guamagentorange.info/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Johnston_Atoll_History.261114404.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 21, 2013 |accessdate=August 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, some records of the storage and disposition of Agent Orange at [[Johnston Atoll]] have been associated with the historical records of [[Operation Red Hat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.va.gov/vetapp14/Files1/1403511.txt|title=Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, claimed as due to herbicide exposure or ionizing radiation.|last=|first=|date=February 10, 2014|website=US Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Okinawa, Japan===
There have been dozens of reports in the press about use and/or storage of military formulated herbicides on Okinawa that are based upon statements by former U.S. service members that had been stationed on the island, photographs, government records, and unearthed storage barrels. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has denied these allegations with statements by military officials and spokespersons, as well as a January 2013 report authored by Dr. Alvin Young that was released in April 2013.&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blanket2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2013/06/04/issues/as-evidence-of-agent-orange-in-okinawa-stacks-up-u-s-sticks-with-blanket-denial/ |title=Issues as evidence of agent orange in Okinawa stacks up US sticks with blanket denial |date=June 4, 2013 |newspaper=Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An Ecological Assessment of Johnston Atoll cover.png|thumb|left|A scientific study of the effects military contamination at Johnston Atoll included a statement confirming records of Agent Orange storage in Okinawa.&lt;ref name="Ecological" /&gt;]]

In particular, the 2013 report refuted articles written by journalist Jon Mitchell as well as a statement from "An Ecological Assessment of Johnston Atoll" a 2003 publication produced by the [[United States Army Chemical Materials Agency]] that states, "in 1972, the U.S. Air Force also brought about 25,000 200L drums of the chemical, Herbicide Orange (HO) to Johnston Island that originated from Vietnam and was stored on Okinawa."&lt;ref name="Ecological"&gt;{{cite web |title="An Ecological Assessment of Johnston Island," produced through funding from the Chemical Materials Agency, United States Department of the Army.

Further official confirmation of restricted (dioxin containing) herbicide storage on Okinawa appeared in a 1971 Fort Detrick report titled "Historical, Logistical, Political and Technical Aspects of the Herbicide/Defoliant Program", which mentioned that the environmental statement should consider "Herbicide stockpiles elsewhere in PACOM (Pacific Command) U.S. Government restricted materials Thailand and Okinawa ([[Kadena AFB]])."&lt;ref name="Stockpile"&gt;{{cite news |title= "Herbicide Stockpile" at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa: 1971 U.S. Army report on Agent Orange |first=Jon |last=Mitchell |url=http://japanfocus.org/-Jon-Mitchell/3883 |newspaper=The Asia-Pacific Journal, Vol 11, Issue 1, No. 5, |date=January 14, 2012 |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 DoD report says that the environmental statement urged by the 1971 report was published in 1974 as "The Department of Air Force Final Environmental Statement", and that the latter did not find Agent Orange was held in either Thailand or Okinawa.&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blanket2013"/&gt;

===Thailand===
Agent Orange was tested by the United States in Thailand during the war in Southeast Asia. Buried drums were uncovered and confirmed to be Agent Orange in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Agent Orange Found Under Resort Airport |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-05-26/news/9905260083_1_agent-orange-chemical-birth-defects|work=Chicago tribune News |location=Chicago, Illinois |date=May 26, 1999 |agency=Tribune News Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers who uncovered the drums fell ill while upgrading the airport near [[Hua Hin District]], 100&amp;nbsp;km south of Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Boonthan |last=Sakanond|title=Thailand: Toxic Legacy of the Vietnam War|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/1999/05/thailand-toxic-legacy-of-the-vietnam-war/ |location=Bangkok, Thailand |date=May 19, 1999 |agency=Inter Press Service }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnam-era Veterans whose service involved duty on or near the perimeters of military bases in Thailand anytime between February 28, 1961, and May 7, 1975, may have been exposed to herbicides and may qualify for VA benefits.&lt;ref name="VA.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/locations/thailand.asp |title=Thailand Military Bases and Agent Orange Exposure – Public Health |publisher=[[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] |accessdate=10 March 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A declassified Department of Defense report written in 1973, suggests that there was a significant use of herbicides on the fenced-in perimeters of military bases in Thailand to remove foliage that provided cover for enemy forces.&lt;ref name="VA.gov"/&gt;

In 2013, VA determined that herbicides used on the Thailand base perimeters may have been tactical and procured from Vietnam, or a strong, commercial type resembling tactical herbicides.&lt;ref name="VA.gov"/&gt;

===United States===
The [[University of Hawaii]] has acknowledged extensive testing of Agent Orange on behalf of the United States Department of Defense in Hawaii along with mixtures of Agent Orange on Kaua'i Island in 1967–68 and on Hawaii Island in 1966; testing and storage in other U.S. locations has been documented by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Keever |first1=Beverly Deepe |title=University vulnerable to pitfalls of secret experiments |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2005/03/27/editorial/special2.html |accessdate=30 March 2017|work=Star Bulletin |date=March 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Health.

In 1971, the C-123 aircraft used for spraying Agent Orange were returned to the United States and assigned various East Coast USAF Reserve squadrons, and then employed in traditional airlift missions between 1972 and 1982. In 1994, testing by the Air Force identified some former spray aircraft as "heavily contaminated" with dioxin residue. Inquiries by aircrew veterans in 2011 brought a decision by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs opining that not enough dioxin residue remained to injure these post-Vietnam War veterans. On 26 January 2012, the U.S. Center For Disease Control's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry challenged this with their finding that former spray aircraft were indeed contaminated and the aircrews exposed to harmful levels of dioxin. In response to veterans' concerns, the VA in February 2014 referred the C-123 issue to the Institute of Medicine for a special study, with results released on January 9, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Agent Orange Residue on Post-Vietnam War Airplanes |url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/locations/residue-c123-aircraft/index.asp |author=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs |accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Post-Vietnam Dioxin Exposure in Agent Orange–Contaminated C-123 Aircraft|url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2015/Post-Vietnam-Dioxin-Exposure-in-Agent-Orange-Contaminated-C-123-Aircraft.aspx|author=Institute of Medicine of the National Academies|accessdate=April 2, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150404212954/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2015/Post-Vietnam-Dioxin-Exposure-in-Agent-Orange-Contaminated-C-123-Aircraft.aspx|archivedate=April 4, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suspended spraying of Agent Orange in [[U.S. National Forest|National Forests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nicosia |first=Gerald |title=Home to War: A History of the Vietnam Veterans' Movement |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hq2_JFvV0kC&amp;pg=PA446 |year=2004 |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf |isbn=978-0-7867-1403-2 |page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A December 2006 Department of Defense report listed Agent Orange testing, storage, and disposal sites at 32 locations throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, Thailand, Puerto Rico, Korea, and in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2006: pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; The Veteran Administration has also acknowledged that Agent Orange was used domestically by U.S. forces in test sites throughout the United States. [[Eglin Air Force Base]] in Florida was one of the primary testing sites throughout the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report on DoD Herbicides Outside of Vietnam |url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/docs/agentorange/dod_herbicides_outside_vietnam.pdf |publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs |accessdate=September 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup programs==
In February 2012, Monsanto agreed to settle a case covering Dioxin contamination around a plant in [[Nitro, West Virginia]], that had manufactured Agent Orange. Monsanto agreed to pay up to $9 million for cleanup of affected homes, $84 million for medical monitoring of people affected, and the community's legal fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-02-24/monsanto-says-it-settled-west-virginia-lawsuits-over-nitro-plant |title=Monsanto Settles West Virginia Lawsuits Over Nitro Plant |last=Kaskey |first=Jack |date=February 24, 2012 |publisher=Bloomburg |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wvgazettemail.com/News/201311220094|title=Supreme Court affirms Monsanto pollution settlement in Nitro|date=November 22, 2013|work=|publisher=Charleston Gazette-Mail|last1=Ward|first1=Ken|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August 2012, the United States and Vietnam began a cooperative cleaning up of the toxic chemical on part of [[Danang International Airport]], marking the first time Washington has been involved in cleaning up Agent Orange in Vietnam. Danang was the primary storage site of the chemical. Two other cleanup sites the United States and Vietnam are looking at is [[Biên Hòa]], in the southern province of [[Đồng Nai Province|Đồng Nai]]—a "hotspot" for [[dioxin]]—and [[Phù Cát]] airport in the central province of [[Bình Định]], says U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam [[David Shear]]. According to the Vietnamese newspaper ''[[Nhân Dân]]'', the U.S. government provided $41 million to the project, which will reduce the contamination level in 73,000 cubic meters of soil by late 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/09/us-vietnam-usa-agentorange-idUSBRE87803K20120809|title=U.S. starts its first Agent Orange cleanup in Vietnam|last=Ho|first=Binh Minh|date=August 9, 2012|work=|access-date=March 30, 2017|publisher=Reuters|editor-last=Michael Perry|editor-first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 45,000 cubic meters were "cleaned", an equal amount began in October 2016 scheduled for completion in mid 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-10-vietnam-danang-dioxin-clean-up.html|title=Vietnam, US launch Danang dioxin clean-up|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that destruction requires high temperatures (over 1000 °C), the destruction process is energy intensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs225/en/|title=Dioxins and their effects on human health|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Bernadette McCallion of [[AllMovie]] gave the film two and a half stars out of five and called the film a "heart-wrenching made-for-cable drama". Diane Wild of [[DVD Verdict]] reviewed the film in 2005. She felt the film lost its "emotional effect because we don't get to know these characters as real people". She added: "The filmmakers may have thought the story was compelling enough on its own, but without the help of well-developed characters, it feels oddly jarring. Criticizing this well-meaning film feels like kicking a puppy - a sick puppy - but it's not a particularly entertaining hour and a half, when what should be a heart wrenching story is undermined by a script that treats its protagonists as saints instead of people. Unfortunately ''And Then There was One'' is too dated and simplistic to bring anything meaningful to the AIDS on film canon, and it doesn't manage to be a compelling drama outside of the real-life tragedy of the disease itself."&lt;ref name="dvdverdict1"/&gt;

Buchan makes a brief appearance as himself.&lt;ref name=gateway&gt;{{cite web|title=Angus Buchan's Ordinary People Opens April 5 |url=http://gatewaynews.co.za/2012/02/17/angus-buchans-ordinary-people-movie-opens-in-sa-on-april-5/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504162122/http://gatewaynews.co.za/2012/02/17/angus-buchans-ordinary-people-movie-opens-in-sa-on-april-5/ |archivedate=4 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film opens with Angus Buchan's story as he realizes from the time he is a teen that he wants to be a preacher, and is discouraged when his minister tells him about the years of schooling he must complete.  He goes on to acquire a farm and eventually marry, and while he works hard to make a success of his land, he never abandons his dream.  He begins by preaching to the maize in his field from the back of his truck, and this grows into his audience of thousands at his Mighty Men's Conferences.

The story then shifts to three interwoven stories, based on real characters and real events.

Lucky Nzimande (Lucky Koza) is a career criminal who unwittingly attempts to hijack what turns out to be two policemen on their way to the Mighty Men's Conference.  After his gun fails to fire on Lucky, one of the policemen takes this as a sign from God that he is meant to take the man to the Conference with them. They handcuff Lucky in the back and ask him about his story; he talks about never knowing his father and his mother dying when he was 8.  He started stealing early on to help provide for his siblings and grandmother, who died when he was 13.  Lucky escapes from the policemen and is assaulted that night, suffering a gash on his head.  The next day the men see him and kindly offer to tend to his wound and give him a ride home.  Afterwards he agrees to go to the Conference with them.

André Cloete (Jaco Muller) is an alcoholic young adult who is self-destructing quickly due in part to his emotionally absent but strictly religious father.  His mother covers for him when he crashes his car into a neighbor's gate, begging her not to call the police.  After another severe accident his father prays over him and realizes he is too harsh, but Andre continues to drink and party after getting out of the hospital.  He then finally agrees to attend the Conference with his father and brother.

John Peters (Anton Dekker) is a middle-aged [[panel beater]] and biker with two sons.  He marries a woman named Marlene and she and her two girls move in with them.  Marlene's brother-in-law Danny (David James) asks John for a business loan; John doesn't have the money but agrees to stand surety if Danny applies for a bank loan.  John's youngest son then dies in a motorcycle accident, Danny defaults on the loan and John is diagnosed with a chronic lung condition. Sensing he is taking his anger out on his oldest son, Marlene encourages him to attend the Conference.  John reconciles with Danny and apologizes to his son before he goes.

The men all make their way to a Mighty Men's Conference where they listen to Buchan's preaching, which includes his recounting of the two heart attacks he suffered the year before.

After the Conference, Lucky returns to his impoverished hometown and begins passing out religious flyers.  Andre calls a friend and tells him that he's given his life to the Lord.  John suffers an accident on the way home and dies.  After his funeral, Danny is seen off to himself, crying and praying.

The film ends with titles revealing that Lucky continues to preach, Andre does volunteer work, and John's oldest son Gavin took over his business and continues to care for Marlene and her girls.&lt;ref name="gateway" /&gt;&lt;ref name=screenafrica&gt;{{cite web | title = New Angus Buchan Film Starts Shooting | url = http://www.screenafrica.com/page/news/industry/420877-New-Angus-Buchan-film-starts-shooting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bonsai Kitten''' was a [[hoax]] website that claimed to provide instructions on how to grow a kitten in a jar, so as to mold the bones of the kitten into the shape of the jar as the cat grows, much like how a [[bonsai]] plant is shaped. It was made by an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] university student going by the [[Pseudonym|alias]] of Dr. Michael Wong Chang.&lt;ref name="declan"&gt;{{cite web|author=Declan McCullagh|date=9 February 2001|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2001/02/41733|title=FBI Goes After BonsaiKitten.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317000000/http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2001/02/41733 |archivedate=17 March 2014|publisher=[[Wired News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The website generated furor after members of the [[General public|public]] complained to [[animal rights]] organizations. The Michigan Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA) stated that "while the site's content may be faked, the issue it is campaigning for may create [[Animal abuse|violence towards animals]]". Although the website was shut down some time ago, [[petitions]] are still circulated to shut down the site or complain to its [[internet service provider|ISP]]. The website has been debunked by several organizations including [[snopes.com]] and [[the Humane Society of the United States]].

==Start of the website==

On October 30, 2000, BonsaiKitten.com was featured as a "Cruel Site of the Day" on the website Cruel.com. When this attracted complaints, Cruel.com removed its links to BonsaiKitten.com. Afterwards, however, when links to the BonsaiKitten.com website then spread across the world, many concerned animal lovers sent complaints to the [[Animal Welfare Institute]] and the [[Humane Society of the United States]]. Animal welfare groups made statements saying that Bonsai Kittens were not real. The URL drew criticism, which caused the initial host, MIT, to remove it.&lt;ref name="declan" /&gt;

==Description of the spoof==
[[File:Square watermelon.jpg|thumb|[[Square watermelon]]. The square watermelon was later said by the site creator to be influential in the creation of BonsaiKitten.com. (Square watermelons are grown in jars so as to form a square shape.)]]
BonsaiKitten.com's pictures show kittens in jars, presented as real examples of the "lost art" as described on the Bonsai Kitten web page. The spoof, according to "Dr. Chang", is that the world increasingly sees nature as a commodity, so such a site may well be in demand. The spoof came to large-scale attention as The Cruel Site of the Day for December 22, 2000, and was continually heavily condemned by animal rights organizations, and after hundreds of people complained daily to them, they stated that even if Bonsai Kitten was a spoof it "encourages animal cruelty".&lt;ref name="declan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer Jacobson |date=21 January 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211191919/http://chronicle.com/free/2001/02/2001022101t.htm|url=http://chronicle.com/free/2001/02/2001022101t.htm|title=Created at MIT, a 'Bonsai Kitten' Website Stirs Animal Lovers' Passions|publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education|The Chronicle]]|archivedate=11 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Salkowski|date=19 February 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310213313/http://dispatches.azstarnet.com/joe/2001/0219-982430241.htm|title=Animal Lovers Aren't Laughing at kitty-contorting web spoof|publisher=Dispatches Ground Zero|url=http://dispatches.azstarnet.com/joe/2001/0219-982430241.htm|archivedate=10 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The webpage being featured on the cruel.com website was significantly controversial and it was quickly removed. Initial humane society statements decrying the website as "encouraging abuse" caused local investigation, along with an [[FBI]] announcement that it was to investigate the [[hoax]]. The prosecution of the site by the FBI was welcomed by animal activists, but decried by web authorities. The FBI backed up its investigating of Bonsai Kitten by using a law signed by President Bill Clinton in 1999.&lt;ref name="declan" /&gt; The attacking of the BonsaiKitten.com website had the effect of displacing the website, which found a new ISP two more times, before being permanently hosted on [[Rotten.com]] servers. Because the website is still kept on some mirrors, it continues{{update after|2011|11|26}} to receive complaints from animal activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Linda Fuoco|date=8 August 2001|title= Pet Tales - Monthly Column|publisher=Pittsburgh Post Gazette|quote=The Allegheny County district attorney's office launched an investigation after receiving complaints about Bonsai Kitten.

The furor over the site triggered by animal rights organizations has been offset by their continued statements that the site itself is a fake. They have been stating this since 2001.&lt;ref name="janelle" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Theo Emery |date=2001-02-22 |title=Animal Lovers Not Laughing at about joke Internet site "Bonsai Kitten" |work=[[Associated Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy post-2000===

Since 2000, groups such as the [[Animal Welfare Institute]] and The Humane Society of the United States have received hundreds of complaints. Animal welfare groups declared the site as fake but stated they did believe it was potentially harmful. Other animal rights groups have stated that the site creates an atmosphere of cruelty to animals. There is no evidence to date that the site is anything more than satire. Numerous authorities have advised people to stop sending complaint forms via [[email]].

The original bonsaikitten.com is [[mirror website|mirrored]] by many sites today. The nature and presentation of the sites content is such that many [[animal rights activist]]s still take issue with the context of the website. Bonsai Kitten has been further updated from other servers, but infrequently and slowly, with recent additions to the site being research indicating that kitty litter causes [[brain damage]]. The website states that this enhances the Bonsai Kitten art form's practical value.&lt;ref name="hunting" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes_Bonsai"&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/bonsai.asp Bonsai Kitten]. Snopes. Retrieved 2010-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the controversy===

The controversy started soon after the creation of the BonsaiKitten.com website.&lt;ref name="hunting" /&gt; It has continued since and has been the object of numerous spam email pleas. These pleas rely on the audiences, often not knowing English, to spread them.&lt;ref name="Snopes_Bonsai" /&gt; Consequently, these petitions are often spread via the Internet in non-English-speaking countries.&lt;ref name="Snopes_Bonsai" /&gt; Blues News also provided a link, which was shortly thereafter removed from the site, as complaints against the website's existence and its content began to surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Smith |first=Andrew |date= 26 January 2001 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/01/26/bonsai_kitten_craze_sweeps_online/ |title=Bonsai Kitten craze sweeps online world |work=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central City Opera House''' is located in the [[Central City/Black Hawk Historic District]] in [[Central City, Colorado]], United States. It was constructed in 1878.&lt;ref name="Leggett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leggett|first=Ann|title=Insiders' Guide® to Boulder and Rocky Mountain National Park|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SI2M91foS7IC&amp;pg=PA171|date=August 18, 2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7627-5624-7|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has offered operatic and theatrical productions that drew prominent actors and performers in the late 19th-century, and in the early 20th-century it was a motion picture theatre.

The opera house was designated to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=73000474}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Central City Opera House |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author=Liston E.

==Construction and subsequent renovations==
In 1877, the citizens of Central City formed the Gilpin County Opera House Association to fundraise for the state's first [[opera house]].&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown pp. 173–179" /&gt; [[Denver]] architect [[Robert S. Roeschlaub]] designed the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] stone and brick structure,&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc /&gt; with a crescent-shaped balcony and arched windows.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; [[San Francisco]] artist [[John C. Massman]] painted a mural to the ceiling with a central medallion that features the sky, surrounded by a large geometrical patter, and [[trompe-l'œil]] architectural moldings.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc /&gt;

It was built by Welsh and Cornish miners and town residents, who had a tradition of music,&lt;ref name="Loomis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Satterthwaite|first=Ann|title=Local Glories: Opera Houses on Main Street, Where Art and Community Meet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXOhCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT207|date=February 23, 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-939256-8|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some of the best building professionals in the area.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The opera house is kept cool during the summer by a creek flows that through a flume under the building.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Electricity was installed in 1896 and it was renovated, without structural changes in 1903.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc /&gt;

In 1929 a dedicated band of Denver preservationists and music lovers formed the Central City Opera House Association to perform a renovation and re-open the opera house.  It was a volunteer-driven effort led by [[Ida Kruse McFarlane]], Edna Chappell and [[Anne Evans (arts patron)|Anne Evans]] that resulted in an extensive restoration of the Opera House in 1932.&lt;ref name="Brown pp. 173–179" /&gt; In the 1980s and 1990s, the entire structure was restored, including the foundation and replacement of the 1920-era lighting relic by a computerized lighting system. In 1999, wooden chairs were replaced with plush new theater seating.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Productions and cinema==
[[File:2013-7 s.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.9|Portrait of Edwin Booth by John Singer Sargent, 1890, which hung at The Players clubhouse. Now in the collection of the [[Amon Carter Museum of American Art]].]]
With the 1878 grand opening, Central City was Colorado's cultural capital until another opera house, Tabor Grand Opera House, opened in 1881. The Opera House was not turning a profit and it expanded its repertoire to include theatre productions to increase its revenues. They featured prominent 19th-century actors such as [[Joseph Jefferson]], [[Edwin Booth]], [[Fanny Janauschek|Madame Januschek]] and Fannie Barlow.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc /&gt; In addition, [[Buffalo Bill]] performed here as well as [[P. T. Barnum]]'s circus.&lt;ref name="Brown pp. 173–179" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heim" /&gt;

Peter MacFarlane, who was a contractor for the original construction and the contractor for the 1903 renovation, became the principal owner of the Opera House by 1910, when he opened it as a motion picture theatre. The Opera House closed in 1927.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc /&gt;

[[File:Lillian Gish-edit1.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|[[Lillian Gish]], 1921]]
The opera house was donated to the [[University of Denver]] in May 1931 by MacFarlane's heirs and restoration was organized by the newly formed Central City Opera House Association.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc /&gt; The summer of 1932, actress [[Lillian Gish]] opened the newly restored opera house with ''Camille''.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown pp. 173–179"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert L.

It was first performed in 1956.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;  In 2001, it was the first opera company in the United States to produce ''[[Gloriana]]'' of [[Elizabeth I]] by [[Benjamin Britten]]. [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' was performed by the [[Central City Opera]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="Leggett pp. 172–173"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leggett|first=Ann|title=Insiders' Guide® to Boulder and Rocky Mountain National Park|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SI2M91foS7IC&amp;pg=PA172|date=August 18, 2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7627-5624-7|pages=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Ramey]] and [[Beverly Sills]] have performed at the opera house. It was noted by Daniel Rule, who managed the Central City Opera company, that 29 of the performers of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York had performed at Central City. The Central City Opera House Association owns 30 Victorian houses in town that are used during the summer to board singers who perform at the opera house.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/10/travel/grand-opera-in-a-colorado.html |title=Grand Opera In a Colorado |last=Arsone |first=Sarah |date=June 10, 1990 |work=The New York Times |access-date=June 16, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 2000 all of the operas were performed in English. Central City Opera now performs all of its operas in their original languages.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The opera house continues to offer several operatic productions each summer and screenings of silent and classic films.&lt;ref name="Leggett pp. 172–173"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Arts America: Enjoying the Best Art Museums, Theater, Classical Music, Opera, Jazz, Dance, Film, and Summer Festivals in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Nl__jDIuHIC&amp;pg=PA354|date=March 17, 2014|publisher=Huntington Press Inc|isbn=978-1-935396-04-8|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Concerto: One Night in Central Park''''' is a [[live album]] by Italian [[tenor]] [[Andrea Bocelli]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatermania.com/new-york/news/10-2011/andrea-bocelli-concerto-one-night-in-central-park_43001.html Andrea Bocelli Concerto: One Night In Central Park CD &amp; DVD Set for November 15 Release]&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was recorded September 15, 2011, during a concert at the [[Central Park]]'s [[Great Lawn and Turtle Pond|Great Lawn]], in New York City. Guest performers included [[Celine Dion]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Chris Botti]], [[Bryn Terfel]], [[Pretty Yende]], and music producer [[David Foster]].&lt;ref name="Central Park Guests"/&gt;

PBS Announced that it would broadcast the concert nationwide, as ''Andrea Bocelli Live in Central Park''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/about/news/archive/2011/andrea-bocelli-arts/ PBS Announces Andrea Bocelli Live in Central Park, The Tenor’s Free Concert With New York Philharmonic and Special Guests] [[PBS]].org&lt;/ref&gt;

The album, immediately upon release, entered the Billboard Top 10 and peaked at No. 4 on the [[Billboard 200|Billboard ''200'']].&lt;ref name="Billboard 200"/&gt;

==Background==
It was announced that Bocelli will give a free concert sponsored by [[Barilla Group|Barilla]], in September, on the [[Great Lawn and Turtle Pond|Great Lawn]] of [[Central Park]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Concert Announcement"&gt;[http://bocellicentralpark.com/news/detail/andrea_bocelli_gifts_new_york_city_with_a_once_in_a_lifetime_musical Andrea Bocelli Gifts New York City With A Once In A Lifetime Musical] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402000000/http://bocellicentralpark.com/news/detail/andrea_bocelli_gifts_new_york_city_with_a_once_in_a_lifetime_musical |date=April 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Bocelli Concert Central Park Poster.jpeg|200px|thumb|left|Central Park Concert Poster]]
After the announcement Bocelli declared that, "I cannot help but smile when thinking about the upcoming concert in Central Park. It was my father's dream, and my father was right, because my artistic path would have been entirely different without the strong and sincere embrace of this extraordinary city where everything is possible, even when it seems impossible." Bocelli continues, "My father will not be there, but I can count on his blessing and his kind and gentle smile to give me courage. My mother, sitting in the front row, will feel my father too, and they will be together again just like when I was a little boy performing on the fireplace steps. Perhaps they had secretly dreamed that I might have the opportunity to perform in New York City, and maybe right here in Central Park."&lt;ref name="Concert Announcement"/&gt;

[[Mayor of New York City|New York City Mayor]] [[Michael Bloomberg]] said, "The Great Lawn in Central Park is one of the most remarkable and beautiful outdoor venues in the world and it is a great pleasure to welcome Andrea Bocelli back to New York to perform there. This free concert will be a memorable cultural moment for the thousands of New Yorkers and visitors that will watch the event live in the park, and many, many more through the broadcast by [[WNET]]."&lt;ref name="Concert Announcement"/&gt;

[[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|New York City Parks]] Commissioner Adrian Benepe said, "I join the Mayor and all New Yorkers in thanking Andrea Bocelli and all involved in making a beautiful autumn evening full of splendor and world-class music possible, in one of the most cherished outdoor places in New York City. From the Great Lawn in the heart of [[Manhattan]] to the [[Great Performances]] series on WNET, where millions more will be able to share this gift, it will be a very special occasion. A million thank yous. Grazie mille!"&lt;ref name="Concert Announcement"/&gt;

During the concert that took place September 15, during a rainy day, Bocelli was accompanied by the [[New York Philharmonic]], conducted by its music director [[Alan Gilbert (conductor)|Alan Gilbert]], and the [[Westminster Choir College|Westminster Symphonic Choir]].&lt;ref name="Central Park Guests"&gt;[http://bocellicentralpark.com/news/detail/celine_dion_tony_bennett Céline Dion, Tony Bennett Among Those To Celebrate With Andrea Bocelli On Central Park’s Great Lawn] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132620/http://bocellicentralpark.com/news/detail/celine_dion_tony_bennett |date=April 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also joined on stage by singers [[Celine Dion]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Bryn Terfel]], [[Ana María Martínez]] and [[Pretty Yende]], instrumentalists [[Chris Botti]], [[Andrea Griminelli]] and [[Nicola Benedetti]], and producer [[David Foster]].&lt;ref name="Central Park Guests"/&gt;

The concert took place September 15, and was attended by 70,000 people, including [[Michael Bloomberg|Mayor Bloomberg]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.showbiz411.com/2011/09/16/trumps-trump-each-other-at-andrea-bocelli-central-park-concert Trumps Trump Each Other at Andrea Bocelli Central Park Concert]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/trump_family_reunion_sZA7WMx4T9Er1MNF38mcfI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME= Trump family reunion], [[New York Post]] September 18, 2011 article.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deeply Vale Festivals''' were unique [[free festival]]s held near [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] in northwest England in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979 and at a different site in 1980 and 1981 They are regarded as significant events that united [[punk rock|punk]] music into the festival scene. Anniversary festivals took place in March 2015 and September 2016 (two days).

==History==

===1970s===
In the 1970s [[Rochdale]] resident and associate of [[John Peel]] (through his links with the band Tractor) Chris Hewitt was one of the main organisers of the event between 1976 and 1978 along with residents of a commune further up Oldham Road in Rochdale. Hewitt's inspiration for Deeply Vale Festivals was partly triggered working on [[Bickershaw Festival]] with [[Jeremy Beadle]] in 1972 and an event at [[Rivington Pike]] in August 1976. Chris went on to produce many other festivals and concerts and start a record company [[Ozit/Dandelion Records]].

===Deeply Vale 1976–79===
Starting with an audience of 300 camping for two days in 1976 watching space rockers Body and John Peel favourites [[Tractor (band)|Tractor]], the festival grew to 3,000 in 1977 (bands including [[Andy McCluskey]]'s Pegasus, a forerunner of [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark|OMD]] in 1977). By 1978 and 1979 there were 20,000 people watching bands and camping for six days.

The [[Home Office]]-sponsored body that reported on many pop festivals from the mid-1970s – [[Festival Welfare Services]] – said in a report on the 1978 that the 20,000 people event at Deeply Vale Festival "was actually better organised than the large [[Bob Dylan]] concert at [[Blackbushe]] the same summer"; "In fact in 1978 it was a model for how festivals should be run". It was the biggest free festival in England ending its annual run in the valley of Deeply Vale after four years in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Brown | title=Stiff competition for summer's hot tickets | date=17 April 2006 | work =[[The Guardian]]| url =https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1755284,00.html  | accessdate = 9 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the 1970s festivals, Deeply Vale hoped to bring together music of all styles, to create new styles and genres and maybe break a few. Since music seems to follow trends set in history by names such as [[the Beatles]], [[the Kinks]], Bob Dylan, the [[Rolling Stones]], [[the Doors]] and many others who broke the musical mould of the 1950s and 1960s turning the times into a psychedelic outlook on life. Deeply Vale has been credited as a catalyst for many bands who have formed since the 1970s festivals. Amongst people who claim to have been in the audience and inspired to pursue a musical career include [[Andy Rourke]] of [[The Smiths]], [[David Gedge]] from [[the Wedding Present]], Dave Fielding, [[Mark Burgess (musician)|Mark Burgess]] and Reg Smithies from [[the Chameleons]], [[Jimi Goodwin]] from the [[Doves (band)|Doves]], [[Boff Whalley]] from Chumbawamba Steve Cowen from the [[Mock Turtles]] and [[Ian Brown]] from [[the Stone Roses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Paul | last=Taylor | title=Rock'n'roll Rochdale | date=19 November 2004 | work =[[Manchester Evening News]]| url =http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/137/137475_rocknroll_rochdale.html  | accessdate = 9 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deeply Vale Festivals were the first of the hippie music festivals to mix punk bands on the bill in amongst festival stalwarts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Cowen | title=The Birmingham Post: Perspective: Truly, madly, Deeply Vale | date=14 August 2004 | work =[[Birmingham Post]]| url =http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:BPOC&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=10488E68EF5F767D&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&amp;req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815  | accessdate = 9 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; like [[Steve Hillage]], [[Nik Turner]], [[the Ruts]], [[Misty in Roots]], [[Tractor (band)|Tractor]] (who had already achieved some notoriety as a [[John Peel]] band), [[Here &amp; Now (band)|Here and Now]] and [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]].

[[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] were regulars at the festival at a young age (and [[Mark E. Smith]] held the event in high esteem), and [[Durutti Column]] played their fourth ever gig on the Deeply Vale Festival stage. Both these bands were introduced by a young [[Tony Wilson]] who had just started his own record company and offered to help his friend Chris Hewitt by appearing at Deeply Vale in 1978.

The festival resumed on a smaller scale at Pickup Bank (Edgworth/Darwen) in 1980 and 1981.

===Recognition 2009===
In September 2009, two buildings associated with Deeply Vale Festivals, [[Factory Records]], Tractor and John Peel – one building formerly Tractor Sound Studios in [[Heywood, Greater Manchester|Heywood]] and one in Rochdale Tractor Music / Cargo Studios – had blue plaques unveiled to commemorate the important part the buildings played in the genealogy of rock music. The blue plaques campaign was put together by [[Peter Hook]] and Chris Hewitt.

===''Truly, Madly, Deeply Vale''===
{{See also|Truly, Madly, Deeply Vale}}
Luke Bainbridge (journalist and editor of the ''Observer Music Monthly'' and attendee of Deeply Vale Festivals as a youngster) said in the 2004 ITV documentary ''[[Truly, Madly, Deeply Vale]]'' that the festivals were far more organised than Glastonbury by 1978. In July 2007 the DVD ''Deeply Vale Festivals'' was released. It contains 3 hours 40 minutes of archive band performances and interviews and the 49-minute ''Truly, Madly, Deeply Vale'' film plus other rare interviews, crowd footage and band performances.

===Festivals book===

A 272-page A4 book tracing the history of the four festivals in the Deeply Vale valley 1976/77/78/79, the two (Deeply Vale 1980 and 1981) festivals at Pickup Bank, the Rivington Pike Free Festivals 1976 and 1977, and the Manchester 1978 Rock Against Racism concerts was released in October 2014. The book came in a box set and contained eight hours of Deeply Vale related music spread over 6 CDs.

=== Deeply Vale 2015 ===
Following the release of the documentary, there were plans to resurrect the festival in this century. One idea was to merge with relaunching the [[Bickershaw Festival]] to become the Deeply Vale Bickershaw Festival. In the end Deeply Vale happened again after the release of the 2014 box set.

On 20 March 2015, Deeply Vale Festival 2015 took place in Heywood with Steve Hillage, with Mark E Smith from The Fall there to watch him, plus other performances from Notsensibles, Nik Turner, Segs from The Ruts, Victor Brox, George Borowski, Andy T, Graham Massey and Graham Clark, Andy Sharrocks and Accident on the East Lancs, Wilful Damage, Physical Wrecks, Movement Banned and Brian Eastwood and Pie.

=== Deeply Vale 2016 ===
To mark the 40th anniversary of the first year of Deeply Vale 1976, on Saturday 17 and Sunday 18 September 2016 a festival was held at the Heywood Civic Centre in Heywood, including appearances by many of the artists who had played the original festivals: Steve Hillage, members of Here and Now and Gong, Nik Turner, Segs from The Ruts, The Drones, Victor Brox, Andy T, Mike Sweeney and the Salford Jets, Fast Cars, Andy Sharrocks and Accident on the East Lancs, Wilful Damage, Physical Wrecks, George Borowski and Gaynor Wilson with Jaki Windmill, Andy Bole, Potential Victims, Crude Oil Inc, Alchemist, Mudanzas and loads more. The festival weekend was captured on film and released as a beautiful artworked 3 DVD set.

'''Deon William Swiggs''' (born 6 September 1986, [[Nelson, New Zealand]]) is the Christchurch City Councillor representing the Central ward. Prior to Swiggs being elected, he was most well known for his participation in Rebuild Christchurch, an organisation founded after the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]].

== 1986–2015 ==
[[File:DeonSwiggsPrinceCharles.jpg|thumb|Deon Swiggs meets Prince Charles in Christchurch]]
Swiggs was born in Nelson, New Zealand and is the oldest of 3 siblings. Until Swiggs was 5, he was raised at [[Parihaka|Parihaka Pa]] as a Christian. Swiggs was educated at [[Marlborough Boys' College]] where he was a [[sixth form]] [[prefect]]. After graduating in 2004, Swiggs joined the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] in 2005 as a navigation officer. Swiggs left the Navy in 2008 to pursue a career in the business sector.&lt;ref name="about me"&gt;{{cite web |last=Swiggs |first=Deon |title=Deon Swiggs: About |url= http://deonswiggs.com/about/ |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Swiggs worked as a [[real estate]] agent for Harcourts in New Plymouth before transferring to Christchurch in 2009. He left the company in 2010 to form Swiggs Consulting Limited. Later in 2010, Swiggs was offered the position of South Island Accounts Manager at AdzUp.&lt;ref name="about me" /&gt;

At the time of the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]], Swiggs was working for AdzUp, two days later he founded Rebuild Christchurch, which collated information from a variety of sources and placed this information in an easy to understand format. Swiggs has been called one of the innovate new entrepreneurs born out of the Christchurch earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Entrepreneurs emerge from Chch quake|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Entrepreneurs-emerge-from-Chch-quake/tabid/423/articleID/299853/Default.aspx#ixzz2YdpjgSMi|publisher=3news.co.uk|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February 2011, Swiggs was in the AdzUp office located in the Christchurch CBD when the first earthquake struck,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/02/new-zealand-earthquake-hard-to-move-on-when-ground-keeps-moving.html |title=New Zealand earthquake: Hard to move on when ground keeps moving |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=22 February 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he left the building he was in, and helped other people with the aftermath of the earthquake.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In April 2011, Swiggs was made redundant from AdzUp due to the earthquakes. From this time, Swiggs worked full-time on RebuildChristchurch.co.nz and studied on the side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Entrepreneurs-emerge-from-Chch-quake/tabid/423/articleID/299853/Default.aspx |title=Entrepreneurs emerge from Chch quake – Story – NZ News |publisher=3 News |date= |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Swiggs was nominated for Young New Zealander of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPIT Student in the Business of Recovery|url=http://www.cpit.ac.nz/news-and-events/news/cpit-student-in-the-business-of-recovery|publisher=Cpit.ac.nz|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was named alongside [[Roger Sutton]] and [[Bob Parker (mayor)|Bob Parker]] as a leader in the Canterbury Rebuild.

Swiggs was accepted into a placement at the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology in February 2013 into a Bachelor of Applied Management. In March 2013, Swiggs Graduated from CPIT with Bachelor of Applied Management Majoring in Sales and Marketing &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8127366/Student-numbers-up-in-line-with-rebuild |title=Student numbers up in line with rebuild – Story – NZ News |publisher=The Press |date= |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Graduate Diploma in Innovation and Entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8127366/Student-numbers-up-in-line-with-rebuild |title=Student numbers up in line with rebuild – Story – NZ News |publisher=The Press |date= |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Press'' reported on 27 April 2013 that Swiggs was contemplating running for Councillor of the [[Christchurch City Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Press Campaigners set their sights on council seats|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8602859/Campaigners-set-their-sights-on-council-seats|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 August 2013, Swiggs announced he had put his nomination forward for the [[Christchurch East by-election, 2013|Christchurch East by-election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachel Young |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/the-east/9085151/Deon-Swiggs-to-challenge-Dalziel-seat |title=Deon Swiggs To Stand for Dalziel's Christchurch... |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date= |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 September 2013 Swiggs found his nomination was unsuccessful. Poto Williams was selected and elected Member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poto Williams selected as Labour Christchurch East Candidate|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1309/S00398/poto-williams-selected-as-labour-christchurch-east-candidate.htm|website=Scoop.co.nz|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Swiggs and Christchurch broadcaster Chris Lynch along with award-winning film maker [[Gerard Smyth]] spent a week interviewing various citizens of Christchurch about their views on the Christchurch Earthquake Recovery Act draft transition recovery plan, which expired in April 2016. As of 28 July, the video has been watched more than 30,000 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MEIER|first1=CECILE|title='Huge wave of support' for locally-led recovery|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/business/the-rebuild/70626210/huge-wave-of-support-for-locallyled-recovery|website=The Press|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

name="Fox News - World's First 'Archaeological Dig' of the Internet"&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/11/10/archaeological-dig-internet/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [http://www.digital-archaeology.org Digital Archaeology] exhibition, organised by [http://www.linkedin.com/in/jimboulton Jim Boulton], made its debut at [https://web.archive.org/web/20100924045145/http://www.internetweekeurope.com/ Internet Week Europe] 2010. The show celebrates the golden era of the website but more importantly, it seeks to document the formative years of digital culture and raise the profile of web archiving.

The debut exhibition showcased 15 groundbreaking websites and featured a keynote presentation by Helen Hockx-Yu, Web Archiving Programme Manager at The British Library. Such was the level of interest, Boulton was invited to run it again at [http://www.internetweekny.com Internet Week New York] 2011 in an expanded format, where it attracted 12,000 visitors. The New York show was sponsored by [[Google]] and featured a keynote presentation by Abigail Grotke, Web Archiving Team Lead at the Library of Congress.&lt;ref 
name="Library of Congress blog post"&gt;http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2011/06/digital-archaeology-on-display/&lt;/ref&gt; The event was held again, in a reduced form, as part of [http://digital-archaeology.org/error-404-digital-shoreditch/ Digital Shoreditch] 2013, where it was visited by the team at CERN responsible for restoring the first website.&lt;ref 
name="CERN - First hands-on experience with the Nexus browser"&gt;http://first-website.web.cern.ch/blog/first-hands-experience-nexus-browser&lt;/ref&gt;

Curator [http://www.linkedin.com/in/jimboulton Jim Boulton] said of the importance of the event "Today, when almost a quarter of the earth's population is online, this artistic, commercial and social history is being wiped from the face of the earth. Unless we act now to archive our recent digital past, we are in real danger of losing the building blocks of the web that have so shaped modern culture."&lt;ref

Digital Archaeology featured as a key part of a larger exhibition, called  [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10412004/Space-Invaders-and-Tetris-classed-as-digital-archaeology.html Digital Revolution] debuting at The Barbican in 2014 and now at the National Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm.

===The Project - 1991===
'''The Project''' was the first website to connect and share documents on personal computers via the internet. It was published by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]] in 1991 and used HTML 1.0. Its first web address was http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html, which described the WorldWideWeb project.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - The Project"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/1.php&lt;/ref&gt;

No screenshots were kept of the very first website. The website featured at Digital Archaeology is believed to be the earliest available copy, from 1992.&lt;ref

===Antirom - 1994===
The '''Antirom''' art collective was formed in London in 1994 as a “protest against ill-conceived point-and-click interfaces grafted onto repurposed old content repackaged as multimedia.” With the radical vision to explore interactivity as a media in its own right rather than as an interface to content, [[Antirom]] changed the face of interactive design. The original experiments were funded by a grant from the Arts Council of Great Britain. Design agency Tomato contributed graphically, and the band Underworld provided the music. Developed rapidly by multiple authors, Antirom's interactive experiments often revolved around a single idea, such as sound mixing or scrolling. Although always entertaining, these playful, interactive “toys” could deliberately confound, forcing the user into an active relationship with the media.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - Antirom"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/2.php&lt;/ref&gt; Built in Director 5 (Shockwave).

===Word.com - 1995===
Founded by Dan Pelson, Tom Livacarri and Carey Earle in 1995, '''Word.com''' was one of the earliest and most influential e-zines. Unlike many web publications of the time, which simply re-created the print magazine format online, [[Word Magazine|Word.com]] was a true multimedia experience, incorporating games, audio, and chat. Its DIY ethos and first-person conversational style immediately appealed its audience of “underachieving sub-geniuses,” and the site was soon receiving 95,000 page views a day. Its authentic content (notably the Shockwave game [[SiSSYFiGHT]], often cited as one of the earliest examples of massively multiplayer online games) and Yoshi Sodeoka's icon-driven design influenced hundreds of other sites, yet it was never a commercial success. But Word.com was also far from commercially naïve — a pioneer in the use of online advertising, it was the first website to integrate paid content for branded microsites.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - Word.com"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/3.php&lt;/ref&gt; The site used HTML2.0, Director 5 &amp; RealAudio.

===The Blue Dot - 1995===
[[Razorfish (company)|Razorfish]] became one of the world's most established digital agencies partly because of a bouncing blue dot. Created out of an apartment in the East Village, its homepage utilized the server-push GIF-animation capabilities of Netscape Navigator 1.1 to create the first animated website — crashing many a browser in the process. Razorfish founders Jeffrey Dachis and Craig Kanarick followed this milestone with one of the first online art galleries, '''The Blue Dot'''. Created “for our souls” rather than commercial gain, The Blue Dot was a playground of art, design, photography, and provocation, showcasing work by artists like Ryan McGinness, Spencer Tunick, and Jill Greenberg. It notoriously included such delights as “The Society for the Recapture of Virginity” and “Dick for a Day.”

The Blue Dot is now in the permanent collection of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - The Blue Dot"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/4.php&lt;/ref&gt; The site used HTML2.0, Director 5 &amp; RealAudio.

===CyberOrchids - 1996===
Designer, programmer, technologist, artist, professor, author: [[John Maeda]] is all of these and more. Now president of the Rhode Island School of Design, the former associate research director of MIT's Media Lab has also enjoyed a long and productive commercial partnership with Japanese cosmetic brand Shiseido. Commissioned to accompany Shiseido's orchid e-commerce service, John Maeda's '''CyberOrchids''', built as a Java applet, was one of the first e-card tools.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide -Cyber Orchids"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/5.php&lt;/ref&gt; The site used HTML 2.0, Java.

===The Web Stalker - 1997===
[[Webby Award|Webby]] Award-winner and “the first internet application designed by artists,” '''The Web Stalker''' is an experimental browser developed by British web-art activists I/O/D. Working on the principle that the browsers of the day (Netscape Navigator 4.01 and Internet Explorer 3.0) were built to fulfil commercial imperatives determined by advertisers and software corporations rather than the information needs of the individual, The Web Stalker browser stripped out the superfluous, so only the raw text, links, and meta data remained.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - The Web Stalker"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/6.php&lt;/ref&gt; Built in Director 6.

===Noodle Box - 1997===
Using Director 6 software, '''Noodle Box''' was a series of computer game like interactive experiments. Created by Play/Create and designed by [[Daniel Brown (web designer)|Daniel Brown]], the site featured a landscape of building blocks, inspired by the computer games of the 1980s.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - Noodle Box"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/7.php&lt;/ref&gt; The site was set apart from many others of its time due to the playful nature of the site. Built in Director 6.

Noodlebox appears in the San Francisco MOMA and the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A).

===Head-space - 1997===
The '''Head-space'''&lt;ref name="Head-space Project"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPX8Ngfjn5A&lt;/ref&gt; Project, created and curated by [[Jason Michael Holland|Jason Holland]] and [[Felix Velarde]] and produced by [[Head New Media]], was a collaborative creative space and a spawning ground for multiple interactive projects such as the Brixton-based community website [[Urban 75]] and John Lundberg's CircleMakers.org but was perhaps most famous for the interactive game Slap a Spice Girl.&lt;ref name="Story Worldwide - Head-space"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/25.php&lt;/ref&gt; The site used both Director &amp; HTML 3.

===K10k - 1997===
'''K10k''', also known as “The Designers’ Lunchbox,”  was a global digital design portal. The site was the result of a chance meeting online between Toke Nygaard and Michael Schmidt. Nygaard and Schmidt gained inspiration from sites like DigitalThread.com and Shift.jp.org but wanted to create something that was “fresher and funkier, and updated every single week.”&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - K10k"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/8.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was built by [http://www.cubancouncil.com Cuban Council] and is built in HTML 4.0.

===Less Rain - 1998===
Less Rain was founded in 1997 by Vassilios Alexiou and Lars Eberle. The name they chose for their company not only reflects London's temperate climate but also their design philosophy. Clean, natural, playful and unpredictable. Kicking against the vector graphic trend dominating interaction design at the time, their early work had a hand-crafted feel, driven by photography. The first site they designed for themselves, nicknamed Walter The Fish, typified their approach.Walter was a grouper, bought at Billingsgate Fish Market in 1998. Photographed at five stages of consumption, he provided the navigation system for Less Rain's website. Those visiting on fast connection speeds were served the full fish. Slower speeds were offered the bare bones. Built in HTML 3.0, Director 6.0 (Shockwave)

===New Beetle - 1998===
Founded in 1994, Deepend was one of the first true web design agencies. The Web's slow connection speeds, limited fonts and restricted colour palette deterred most designers. Gary Lockton, David Streek and Simon Waterfall were the exception. While their contemporaries were exploring the technical capabilities of the web, Deepend defined its aesthetic potential. Deepend websites for VW Beetle, Hoover and the Design Museum in ’98, ’99 and 2000 set the standard the rest of the industry aspired to. Incorporating great design, audio, video and games, they pushed the medium way beyond its supposed limits. Built in HTML 3.0, Flash 3.0, QuickTime 3.0

===Modern Living - 1998===
Starting off life as a comic strip in 1996, Dutchman Han Hoogerbrugge began publishing his '''Modern Living''' / Neurotica animations to his website as a series of looping GIFs in ’98. Soon afterward, he progressed to Flash, which introduced an interactive element to his art. Describing his work as an ongoing self-portrait, the central theme of Hoogerbrugge’s work is his battle with modern life. The repetitive, jerky nature of his animations that so accurately reflect his neurosis are actually a result of the bandwidth restrictions of 1998. A 28k modem necessitates the short, low-frame-rate animations he has become famous for. The series concluded in 2001 when the 100th episode was published. Subsequent work includes the non-linear interactive story “Hotel,” developed for the Submarine Channel.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - Modern Living"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/17.php&lt;/ref&gt; The site is built using animated GIFs and Flash 3.

===Yugop - 1999===
When [[Yugo Nakamura]] unveiled his MONO*crafts site at yugop.com in 1999, it made an entire industry stop and draw a breath. One of the first designers to embrace and exploit the potential of [[ActionScript]], Nakamura's interactive environments were very fluid, calming, and natural. Previously a gardener, he quotes an old Japanese saying: “Rather than beautifying one’s own creation, make better the environment that surrounds it” — in other words, better to make a beautiful user experience than a beautiful website.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - Yugop"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/9.php&lt;/ref&gt; Built in Flash 4.

===Jonni Nitro - 1999===
In 1999, Jonni Nitro was the most exciting animation on the Web. Centred on a female secret agent on a quest against an unnamed terrorist threat, Tubatomic's G-Woman took its visual cues from graphic novels like Frank Miller's Sin City. Using a highly stylised video-to-vector process, the animated series pushed Flash well beyond its apparent capabilities.&lt;ref 
name="Submarine Channel - Jonni Nitro"&gt;http://www.submarinechannel.com/animation/jonni-nitro/&lt;/ref&gt; Built in Flash 4.

===Barneys - 2000===
Founded by Peter Kang and Gene Na in 1999, one of Kioken's early websites was for the R &amp; B singer Brandy, and a string of entertainment clients followed, most notably including Jennifer Lopez, Motown, and Bad Boy Records. Criticized by some for a lack of usability, contrary to popular opinion, Kioken was resolute in its belief that audiences raised in the video game era were practiced in deciphering interfaces — in fact, they took pleasure in the experience. Taking their cue from TV and video games, Kioken's websites had a depth and emotional quality absent from their counterparts. [[Bleed (printing)|Full-bleed]] images, parallax movement, and floating palettes were used with great effect, all coming together beautifully on '''Barneys.com'''. According to Na, it's simple: “You have to think beyond the limits of a page.”&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - Barneys"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/12.php&lt;/ref&gt; Built in Flash 4.

===Levi Twisted Denim - 2000===
Lateral was founded in 1997 by Jon Bains and Simon Crab. Quickly joined by David Jones and David Hart, they were already digital veterans, having worked at Obsolete since 1994. Their first account was Levi's Europe, an account they retained for a decade. The Levi Twisted Denim site, twists the browser, opening multiple windows and creating a usability nightmare in the process. Bravo to them. Built in HTML 4.01, Director 8.0 (Shockwave), RealPlayer 4.0

===PrayStation - 2000===
[[Joshua Davis (web designer)|Joshua Davis]] wanted to write and illustrate children's books. After his first two attempts received two rejection letters, a friend told him, “You don’t need them anymore — there’s this whole internet thing happening. You can self-publish.” Davis went out and bought a book on HTML and changed the face of interactive design forever. '''PrayStation''' was Joshua Davis's sketchbook — an experimental personal site of digital exploration, a place where success and failure were all documented, learned from and generously shared. Lessons weren’t all that were given away: PrayStation was one of the first sites to provide its source files free. Fueled by his obsessive nature, the site evolved at an astonishing rate, and Davis built a devoted audience and a deserved reputation as the most exciting web designer on the planet.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - PrayStation"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/11.php&lt;/ref&gt; Built in Flash 4.

===MTV2 - 2000===
'''MTV2''''s BAFTA award-winning website designed by Bradley Cho-Smith and Mickey Stretton and built by agency Digit and was known for marking the first time the creative started with the web and led the TV and print campaigns. It was built largely in Flash, and exploited multiple 3D-authoring tools like Vecta 3D, 3D Studio Max, and Swift 3D.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - MTV2"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/24.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The site's styling is draws inspiration from classic first-person shooter games like Doom or Quake, and there are more subtle culture references to classic video games and science-fiction movies throughout. One example being the rise of a faceted block that exits the screen in homage to the Millennium Falcon from [[Star Wars]].

Built in Flash 8, Vectra 3D, 3D Studio Max, Swift 3D.

===Requiem for a Dream - 2000===
[[Hi-ReS!]] leapt onto our screens in 1999 following the launch of their experimental website soulbath.com, “an exhibition of anti-banners.” Twelve million page views later, the site caught the attention of the film director Darren Aronofsky, and he gave founders Alexandra Jugovic and Florian Schmitt their first commercial project, building the website for his new film Requiem for a Dream. Like all Hi-ReS! film websites since, the result is much more than a trailer, it's a cinematic gem in its own right. Requiem for a Dream is about addiction, compulsion, and inevitable descent. The website investigates similar web-based behaviors, particularly online gambling and the “morbid patterns the medium is able to create in its users.” As the user descends deeper into the malfunctioning website, it gradually deteriorates and finally falls apart, ejecting the visitor in its death throes.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - Requiem for a Dream"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/10.php&lt;/ref&gt; Built in Flash 4.

===Bang &amp; Olufsen - 2000===
'''Bang &amp; Olufsen's''' first global ecommerce site, created by Large Design, was described by the Financial Times as "the most beautiful site in the world". The site was updated monthly and drove users to store via a series of interactive [[product demonstration]]s that recreated the magic of B&amp;O products. The website uses PHP 3, HTML 4.0 and Flash 4.

===JAM: Tokyo-London - 2001===
Airside was founded in 1998 by Fred Deakin, Nat Hunter and Alex Maclean. The playful style they became known for is perhaps best illustrated by the website they created for the Barbican exhibition JAM: Tokyo-London. The exhibition showcased the work of visual designers from both cities. Airside's website served as both the website for the show and an exhibit in its own right. A crowd of animated characters represented the exhibitors. Clicking on them revealed their work, choosing a discipline highlighted the appropriate characters in an entertaining way. Japanese designers danced on request, fashion designers removed their clothes. The site was nominated for a BAFTA. Built in Director 8.0 (Shockwave), HTML 4.01

===Frost Design - 2002===
The post dot-com world was a more serious place. Many agencies had gone out of business, those that hadn’t, had a decade of experience to perfect their craft. Standards were higher. Born out of the ashes of Deepend in 2001, De-construct was one of the agencies that set those standards. Instead of reinventing communication design, they recognised its solid foundations and built on them. No site expressed this more clearly than the typographically driven site they created for Frost Design. Embraced by the entire design industry, it was this site that convinced many graphic design agencies to take the web more seriously. Built in Flash 5.

===Subservient Chicken - 2004===
When ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky wanted its creation for Burger King brought to life online, it turned to long-term collaborator [http://www.barbariangroup.com The Barbarian Group]. Its response was to create an interactive video-based site that allowed visitors to control the chicken via their keyboards. Playing on transgressive webcam culture, more than 300 different clips were tagged with all manner of commands, and, a year before YouTube existed and six years before the Tipp-Ex bear, a much-imitated format was born.”.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - Subservient Chicken"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/18.php&lt;/ref&gt; Built in Flash MX.

===Vodafone Future Vision - 2004===
When Vodafone commissioned [http://www.northkingdom.se North Kingdom] to develop a website that depicts a vision of the future of mobile communications, it did so with an open brief. North Kingdom was not only involved with the design and execution of the site, but it also collaborated on what the future might look like. And it did so with remarkable foresight, predicting the prevalence of geo-location technology, electronic paper, foldable screens, tablet devices, and the dominance of touch-screen interfaces, three years before the launch of the iPhone.”.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - Vodafone Future Vision"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/14.php&lt;/ref&gt; Built in Flash MX.

===Gift Mixer 3000 - 2004===
A hybrid of HAL 9000 and a mixing deck, [http://www.firstborn.com Firstborn]’s Gift Mixer 3000 for Borders is Artificial Intelligence with a sense of humor, a “living, breathing, walking, talking, gift-matching machine.”.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - Gift Mixer 3000"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/26.php&lt;/ref&gt; Built in Flash MX.

===IKEA Dream Kitchens - 2005===
Forsman &amp; Bodenfors's groundbreaking website for IKEA consists of six kitchens frozen in time and space. In one, a champagne bottle erupts and the bubbles hang in midair. In another, steam suspends inanimately above a frying pan. As visitors explore the 3D panoramic views of each kitchen, they are treated to Matrix-style special effects. Combining bullet time and kitchens is about as ambitious as it gets. The IKEA Dream Kitchen website is possibly the most awarded website of all time. Built in Flash 8.0

===We Feel Fine - 2006===
Constantly searching the web for new occurrences of the phrases “I feel” and “I am feeling” and recording the subsequent adjective, '''We Feel Fine''' is a barometer for the world's emotions. By categorizing these feelings by the age, gender, and location of the author and beautifully displaying the results as individual colored dots, the site becomes “an artwork authored by everyone.” Are women more emotional than men? Do our feelings change as we age? Are people happier when the sun is shining? [[Jonathan Harris (artist)|Jonathan Harris]] and [[Sep Kamvar]]'s We Feel Fine answers these questions through millions of individual stories yet reduces them to a data set, dehumanizing us and humanizing the machine in the process.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - We Feel Fine"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/21.php&lt;/ref&gt; Built in Java, Perl, Processing.

===Agent Provocateur - 2007===
Large Design created a series of websites for '''Agent Provocateur''' between 2004 and 2007. They were cited in Vogue magazine as being the “sexiest sites on the web.” Starring Maggie Gyllenhaal, the 2007 website was based on one of the most neglected areas of popular culture, the trashy novel. In the early twentieth century, pulp fiction was churned out in every imaginable genre, and their covers and titles were intense, exploitative, sexy, and graphic featuring some of the most provocative imagery of the time. McHarg reimagined this cover art for Agent Provocateur, retaining the intensity but ensuring women were portrayed in positions of strength. In the words of Joe Corré, “The website does more than sell; it’s about telling a story, taking people on a personal adventure.”.&lt;ref name="Story Worldwide - Agent Provocateur"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/23.php&lt;/ref&gt; Built in Flash 8, HTML 4.01, PHP 3.

===Unlimited - 2007===
Long-term client Orange approached [http://www.pokelondon.com Poke] to communicate the “Unlimited” message it was using to unify its mobile data and broadband offers. Poke's response was to build the world's first never-ending webpage — one that visitors could never reach the bottom of. Even more impressive, the perpetually extending page is a rich collection of animations, mini-games, and interactive toys and appears to never repeat itself. This playful and sharable idea was also provocative, challenging people to try to “beat it,” some resting books on their keyboards overnight in the endeavor.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - Unlimited"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/15.php&lt;/ref&gt; Built in Flash CS3.

===HBO Voyeur - 2007===
Voyeurism is part of human nature: We are fascinated by other people, and the web has given us the unchecked ability to spy on others without censure. The HBO Voyeur advertising campaign plays on this shared guilty pleasure. Created by BBDO to demonstrate the evolution of the HBO brand across multiple platforms, the campaign consisted of a four-minute film projected onto the side of an apartment block in New York and original content distributed across the social web. All held together by a highly sophisticated website developed by [http://www.bigspaceship.com Big Spaceship], this master class in multichannel storytelling was the final nail in the coffin for the stand-alone 30-second ad.&lt;ref 
name="Story Worldwide - HBO Voyeur"&gt;http://www.storyworldwide.com/dig/sites/22.php&lt;/ref&gt; Built in Flash CS3.

=== LA Fashion Week 2008 controversy ===
In 2008, there were numerous celebrity fashion designers showcasing their designs at LA's Fashion Week. Many people believed that, because of this new surge of "celebs-as-trendsetters", some fashion regulars and legitimate designers did not attend the 2008 fashion event. Instead, attendees turned their attention to the designs of "[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]" star [[Lauren Conrad]], who debuted her collection during the week, [[Nicky Hilton]], and [[The Pussycat Dolls]].

[[Sue Wong]] was one of the designers that openly voiced her opinion about celebrity designers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://omg.yahoo.com/l-a-fashion-week-celebrity-by-design/news/7274 omg! news on Yahoo!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Wong calls the emerging trend "absolutely bogus." Wong is usually a regular at the Mercedes-Benz LA Fashion Week, but decided not to show in 2008, claiming she wanted to concentrate on doing something "different."
"Sure, every celebrity and his brother wants to be a fashion designer", said Wong, who has been designing since 1968. "It's not like anybody can pick it up and do it. It's a science. You need to know fit and construction." Wong has also claimed that the celebrities are just capitalizing on their "15 minutes of fame." Normally, up-and-coming designers would not get the kind of exposures celebrities get for their clothing lines.

Lauren Conrad has tried to defend herself against the criticisms and pressures put on her before her fashion launch. Conrad, who has trained at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles, said the additional pressure thrust upon her Fashion Week debut made her nervous while working on the line. She described it as "California chic", basing this season on a recent trip to Paris reflected in simple, clean pieces accessorized with berets, netting, leather gloves, bows and lace."I will probably never have the respect I want in the fashion industry, but I can work hard every day to try and prove myself", Conrad said. "Can I really be criticized for taking advantage on an opportunity that allows me to have what I've always wanted?"

Wong still voiced her skepticism. "Let's see whether she can survive and thrive. It takes so much dedication", she said. "You gotta really pay your dues to be a serious artist." A review by Jenny Peters of Fashion Wire Daily criticized her debut line, writing, "There was absolutely nothing new or innovative in her collection."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionwiredaily.com/first_word/fashion/article.weml?id=1866 Lauren Conrad's First Foray into Fashion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tikal-Calakmul Wars]] were a series of wars between Tikal and Calakmul. The '''First Tikal-Calakmul War''' was the  first of these wars.
During this and following conflicts in [[Petén Basin|Petén]] [[vassal states]] like [[Naranjo]] and [[Dos Pilas]] were often used.
Though [[Yaxchilan]] was in the war it only had a minor presence at the beginning.

==Yaxchilan and Calakmul==
[[File:BackpassagelookinBldg19Yaxchilan.JPG|thumbnail|An alley in Yaxchilan]]
In 537 the Ajaws of [[Bonampak]], [[Lakamtuun]], and [[Calakmul]] (Calakmul) were captured by Yaxchilan.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.121.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bonampak and Lakamtuun remained under the control of Yaxchilan but in retaliation Calakmul conquered the latter. This gave the polity a strategic position with territory in boath the east and the west of [[Tikal]].
Calakmul was the largest Classic Maya city ever, containing around 6500 buildings in the initial 30 square kilometre area.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, M.D. (2011) ''The Maya''. Thames &amp; Hudson&lt;/ref&gt; The population density in the urban core may have been 1000/km2. Greater Calakmul, consisting of around 122 km2, probably had a density of around 420/km2. Together this would count for a total urban population of 50.000 inhabitants. Twenty secondary sites were found within the Calakmul kingdom, raising the population to around 200.000. There appear to have been smaller third- and fourth-level sites. When all populations are summed up, the total population of the Calakmul Kingdom may have been between 1.5- and 1.75 million people. This appears to be a larger population than the kingdom of Tikal.&lt;ref&gt;Braswell, G. E., Gunn, J. D., Domínguez Carrasco, M. R., Folan, W. J., Fletcher, L. A., Morales-López, A., &amp; Glascok, M. D. (2004). Defining the terminal classic at Calakmul, Campeche. The terminal Classic in the maya lowlands: Collapse, transition, and transformation, 162-194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==All out war==
By 546 (9.5.11.11.18 on the Maya calendar) [[Naranjo]] had been conquered by Calakmul; during this time  Aj Wosal was appointed ruler of Naranjo.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 561 (9.6.6.15.17) the ruler known as [[Sky Witness]] was crowned at Los Alcranes.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; His reign began the Kaan dynasty in Calakmul.
Sky Witness played a major role in the politics of the Maya. He forged an alliance with [[Caracol]], which had previously been a major ally of Tikal.
In 562 (9.6.7.16.2) Wak Chan K’awiil, Ajaw of Tikal, was captured and sacrificed by soldiers from Caracol during a raid directly into the city of Tikal. His death ended the reign of his dynasty in Tikal.
In 564 (9.6.9.16.12) troops from Tikal had a victory in Caracol, but it was short lived.
[[File:Calakmul Wall Painting.jpg|thumbnail|left|Tuun K'ab' Hix was Ajaw of Calakmul before Sky Witness]]
In 572 (9.6.18.0.14) the year Sky Witness died Tikal was defeated.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Temple of the Great Jaguar.jpg|thumbnail|Tikal, the temple of the jaguar with the palace behind it]]
The political and economic implications of defeat by Calakmul had a major impact on Tikal. South of Tikal city but still in the kingdom was [[Mutul]], Mutul actually prospered slightly from the war. Tikal remained one of the most powerful cities in Peten, even in the world, but having lost much of its importance power partially transferred to Mutul.
In 695 (9.13.2.14.19) 123 years later Tikal would turn the tables in Calakmul.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.496.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Good Friday''' is a Christian [[holiday]] commemorating the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] and his death at [[Calvary]]. It is observed during [[Holy Week]] as part of the [[Paschal Triduum]] on the Friday preceding [[Easter Sunday]], and may coincide with the Jewish observance of [[Passover]]. It is also known as '''Holy Friday''', '''Great Friday''', and '''Black Friday'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chambers Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA639|accessdate=13 April 2012|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=978-81-86062-25-8|page=639}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elizabeth Webber|author2=Mike Feinsilber|title=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACB81ZeNN5sC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=13 April 2012|year=1999|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-628-2|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Franklin M.

[[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity]] disagree over the computation of the date of Easter and therefore of Good Friday.

==Name==
===Etymology===
A common [[folk etymology]] incorrectly claims "Good Friday" is a corruption of "God Friday". The term in fact comes from the sense "pious, holy" of the word ''good''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/good-friday |title=Good Friday – Definition of Good Friday |publisher=Yourdictionary.com |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' also gives other examples with the sense "of a day or season observed as holy by the church" as an archaic sense of ''good'' (''good'', adj. 8c) as in ''good tide'' meaning "Christmas" or "Shrove Tuesday", and ''Good Wednesday'' meaning the Wednesday in Holy Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/79925#eid2855682 |title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oed.com |date= |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other languages===
In German-speaking countries, Good Friday is generally referred to as ''Karfreitag'' (''Kar'' from [[Old High German]] ''kara''‚ "bewail", "grieve"‚ "mourn", Freitag for "Friday"): Mourning Friday. The ''Kar'' prefix is a [[cognate]] of the English word "care" in the sense of cares and woes; it meant mourning. The day is also known as ''Stiller Freitag'' ("Silent Friday") and ''Hoher Freitag'' ("High Friday, Holy Friday"). In the Nordic countries it is called "The Long Friday". In Greek, Polish and Hungarian, Good Friday is generally referred to as ''Great Friday'' (''Μεγάλη Περασκευή'', ''Wielki Piątek'', ''Nagypéntek'').

[[File:Gustave Doré - The Holy Bible - Plate CXLI, The Judas Kiss.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Judas Kiss'' by [[Gustave Doré]], 1866]]
{{Death of Jesus|Holy Week}}
According to the accounts in the Gospels, the royal soldiers, guided by Jesus' disciple [[Judas Iscariot]], [[Arrest of Jesus|arrested]] Jesus in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]]. Judas received money ([[30 pieces of silver]]) ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:14–16|KJV}}) for [[Bargain of Judas|betraying Jesus]] and told the guards that whomever [[Kiss of Judas|he kisses]] is the one they are to arrest. Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to the house of [[Annas]], the father-in-law of the [[Cohen Gadol|high priest]], [[Caiaphas]]. There he was interrogated with little result and sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest where the [[Sanhedrin]] had assembled ({{Bibleverse||John|18:1–24|KJV}}).

Conflicting testimony against Jesus was brought forth by many witnesses, to which Jesus answered nothing. Finally the high priest adjured Jesus to respond under solemn oath, saying "I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us, are you the Anointed One, the Son of God?" Jesus testified ambiguously, "You have said it, and in time you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of Heaven." The high priest condemned Jesus for [[blasphemy]], and the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin concurred with a sentence of death]] ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:57–66|KJV}}). Peter, waiting in the courtyard, also [[Denial of Peter|denied Jesus]] three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had predicted.

In the morning, the whole assembly brought Jesus to the Roman governor [[Pontius Pilate]] under charges of subverting the nation, opposing taxes to Caesar, and making himself a king ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:1–2|KJV}}). Pilate authorized the Jewish leaders to judge Jesus according to their own law and execute sentencing; however, the Jewish leaders replied that they were not allowed by the Romans to carry out a sentence of death ({{Bibleverse||John|18:31|KJV}}).

[[Pilate's court|Pilate questioned]] Jesus and told the assembly that there was no basis for sentencing. Upon learning that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate referred the case to the ruler of [[Galilee]], [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]], who was in [[Jerusalem]] for the [[Passover]] Feast. [[Jesus at Herod's court|Herod questioned]] Jesus but received no answer; Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate told the assembly that neither he nor Herod found Jesus to be guilty; Pilate resolved to have Jesus whipped and released ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:3–16|KJV}}). Under the guidance of the chief priests, the crowd asked for [[Barabbas]], who had been imprisoned for committing murder during an insurrection. Pilate asked what they would have him do with Jesus, and they demanded, "Crucify him" ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:6–14|KJV}}). [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Pilate's wife]] had seen Jesus in a dream earlier that day, and she forewarned Pilate to "have nothing to do with this righteous man" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:19|KJV}}). Pilate had Jesus [[Flagellation of Christ|flogged]] and then brought him out to the crowd to release him. The chief priests informed Pilate of a new charge, demanding Jesus be sentenced to death "because he claimed to be God's son." This possibility filled Pilate with fear, and he brought Jesus back inside the palace and demanded to know from where he came ({{Bibleverse||John|19:1–9|KJV|}}).

[[File:Ecce homo by Antonio Ciseri (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Antonio Ciseri]]'s depiction of ''[[Ecce Homo]]'' with Jesus and [[Pontius Pilate]], 19th century]]
Coming before the crowd one last time, Pilate declared Jesus innocent and washed his own hands in water to show he had no part in this condemnation. Nevertheless, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified in order to forestall a riot ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:24–26|KJV}}) and ultimately to keep his job. The sentence written was "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews." Jesus carried his cross to the site of execution (assisted by [[Simon of Cyrene]]), called the "place of the Skull", or "[[Golgotha]]" in Hebrew and in Latin "Calvary". There he was crucified along with two criminals ({{Bibleverse||John|19:17–22|KJV}}).

Jesus agonized on the cross for six hours. During his last three hours on the cross, from noon to 3&amp;nbsp;pm, [[Crucifixion darkness|darkness fell over the whole land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45}}; {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:13}}; {{Bibleverse||Luke|23:44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|spoke from the cross]], quoting the messianic [[Psalm 22]]: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"

With a loud cry, Jesus gave up his spirit. There was an earthquake, tombs broke open, and the curtain in the Temple was torn from top to bottom. This tear, according to Christian tradition, signified a removal of restriction of the common Jews from the Temple's "Holiest of Holies", and that God's people now could, themselves, communicate directly with their advocate before God, Jesus the Christ, rather than needing the Temple's High Priest as an intercessor.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The [[centurion]] on guard at the site of crucifixion declared, "Truly this was God's Son!" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45–54|KJV}})

[[Joseph of Arimathea]], a member of the Sanhedrin and secret follower of Jesus, who had not consented to his condemnation, went to Pilate to request the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:50–52|KJV}}). Another secret follower of Jesus and member of the Sanhedrin named [[Nicodemus]] brought about a hundred-pound weight mixture of spices and helped wrap the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39–40|KJV}}). Pilate asked confirmation from the centurion of whether Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:44|KJV}}). A soldier pierced the side of Jesus with a lance causing blood and water to flow out ({{Bibleverse||John|19:34|KJV}}), and the centurion informed Pilate that Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:45|KJV}}).

Joseph of Arimathea took Jesus' body, wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and placed it in his own new tomb that had been carved in the rock ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:59–60|KJV}}) in a garden near the site of crucifixion. Nicodemus ({{Bibleverse||John|3:1|KJV}}) also brought 75 pounds of [[myrrh]] and [[aloes]], and placed them in the linen with the body, in keeping with Jewish burial customs ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39–40|KJV}}). They rolled a large rock over the entrance of the tomb ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:60|KJV}}). Then they returned home and rested, because [[Shabbat]] had begun at sunset ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:54–56|KJV}}). Matt. 28:1 "After the Shabbat, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb". i.e. "After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,.......". "He is not here; he has risen, just as he said..........".(Matt. 28:6) On the third day, which is now known as Easter Sunday (or Pascha), Jesus rose from the dead.

==In Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Christianity==
[[File:Crucifixion by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of the Crucifixion, 16th century, by [[Theophanes the Cretan]] ([[Stavronikita Monastery]], [[Mount Athos]])]]
Byzantine Christians ([[Eastern Christians]] who follow the [[Rite of Constantinople]]: [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] and [[Greek Catholic Church|Greek-Catholics]]) call this day "Great and Holy Friday", or simply "Great Friday".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise Dictionary of Theology|author=Gerald O'Collins, Edward G. Farrugia|p=108|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-587-68236-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the sacrifice of Jesus through his crucifixion is commemorated on this day, the [[Divine Liturgy]] (the sacrifice of bread and wine) is never celebrated on Great Friday, except when this day coincides with the [[Great Feast]] of the [[Annunciation]], which falls on the fixed date of 25 March (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], 25 March currently falls on 7 April of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). Also on Great Friday, the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout [[Great Lent]],&lt;ref&gt;There is a wide variety of uses regarding the [[liturgical colors]] worn during Great Lent and Holy Week in the Rite of Constantinople.&lt;/ref&gt; but instead don [[black vestments]]. There is no "stripping of the altar" on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy and Great Thursday]] as in the West; instead, all of the [[antipendia|church hangings]] are changed to black, and will remain so until the Divine Liturgy on [[Great Saturday]].

The faithful revisit the events of the day through public reading of specific [[Psalms]] and the [[Gospel]]s, and singing [[hymn]]s about Christ's death. Rich visual imagery and symbolism as well as stirring hymnody are remarkable elements of these observances. In the [[Orthodox theology|Orthodox understanding]], the events of [[Holy Week]] are not simply an annual commemoration of past events, but the faithful actually participate in the death and resurrection of Jesus.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Each hour of this day is the new suffering and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service – unique and incomparable both in the power of tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church brings us to the foot of the cross of Christ erected on Golgotha, and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.&lt;ref name="Bulg"&gt;{{Cite book

Great and Holy Friday is observed as a strict [[Fasting|fast]], and adult Byzantine Christians are expected to abstain from all food and drink the entire day to the extent that their health permits. "On this Holy day neither a meal is offered nor do we eat on this day of the crucifixion. If someone is unable or has become very old [or is] unable to fast, he may be given bread and water after sunset. In this way we come to the holy commandment of the Holy Apostles not to eat on Great Friday."&lt;ref name="Bulg"/&gt;

===Matins of Holy and Great Friday===
The Byzantine Christian observance of Holy and Great Friday, which is formally known as '''The Order of Holy and Saving Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ''', begins on Thursday night with the '''''Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels'''''. Scattered throughout this [[Matins]] service are twelve readings from all four of the Gospels which recount the events of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] from the [[Last Supper]] through the [[Crucifixion]] and [[Holy Sepulchre|burial]] of Jesus. Some churches have a candelabrum with twelve candles on it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished.
[[File:Agias Triados frescos cross.jpg|thumb|upright|Good Friday cross from the [[Katholikon|Catholicon]] at Holy Trinity Monastery, [[Meteora]], Greece]]

The first of these twelve readings {{Bibleverse||John|13:31–18:1|KJV}} is the longest Gospel reading of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical year]], and is a [[concatenation]] from all [[four Gospels]]. Just before the sixth Gospel reading, which recounts Jesus being nailed to the cross, a large [[Christian cross|cross]] is carried out of the sanctuary by the priest, accompanied by [[incense]] and candles, and is placed in the center of the [[nave]] (where the congregation gathers)''Sēmeron Kremātai Epí Xýlou'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today He who hung the earth upon the waters is hung upon the Cross ''(three times)''.&lt;br&gt;He who is King of the angels is arrayed in a crown of thorns.&lt;br&gt;He who wraps the Heavens in clouds is wrapped in the purple of mockery. &lt;br&gt;He who in Jordan set Adam free receives blows upon His face.&lt;br&gt;The Bridegroom of the Church is transfixed with nails. &lt;br&gt;The Son of the Virgin is pierced with a spear.&lt;br&gt;We venerate Thy Passion, O Christ ''(three times)''.&lt;br&gt;Show us also Thy glorious Resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

During the service, all come forward to kiss the feet of Christ on the cross. After the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]], a brief, moving hymn, ''The Wise Thief'' is chanted by singers who stand at the foot of the cross in the center of the nave. The service does not end with the [[First Hour]], as usual, but with a special [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] by the priest:

&lt;blockquote&gt;May Christ our true God, Who for the salvation of the world endured spitting, and scourging, and buffeting, and the Cross, and death, through the intercessions of His [[Theotokos|most pure Mother]], of our holy and [[Holy Fathers|God-bearing fathers]], and of all the [[saint]]s, have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and the Lover of mankind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Royal Hours===
[[File:Service of the Royal Hours - Great Friday -- Annunciation, Toronto, 2014.JPG|right|thumb|Vigil during the Service of the Royal Hours.]]
{{main|Royal Hours}}
The next day, in the forenoon on Friday, all gather again to pray the '''''Royal Hours''''', a special expanded celebration of the [[Little Hours]] (including the First Hour, [[Third Hour]], [[Sext|Sixth Hour]], [[Ninth Hour]] and [[Typica]]) with the addition of scripture readings ([[Old Testament]], [[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]]) and hymns about the Crucifixion at each of the Hours (some of the material from the previous night is repeated). This is somewhat more festive in character, and derives its name of "Royal" from both the fact that the Hours are served with more solemnity than normal, commemorating Christ the King who humbled himself for the salvation of mankind, and also from the fact that this service was in the past attended by the Emperor and his court.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

===Vespers of Holy and Great Friday===
[[File:Toronto-Apokathylosis-2012-04-13.jpg|left|thumb|The crucified Christ, just before the [[Deposition from the Cross]] and the placing of the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaphios]] in the Sepulcher.]]
In the afternoon, around 3&amp;nbsp;pm, all gather for the '''''Vespers of the Taking-Down from the Cross''''', commemorating the [[Deposition from the Cross]]. The Gospel reading is a [[concatenation]] taken from all four of the Gospels. During the service, the body of Christ (the ''soma'') is removed from the cross, as the words in the Gospel reading mention [[Joseph of Arimathea]], wrapped in a linen shroud, and taken to the [[altar]] in the sanctuary.[[File:Gold embroidery example.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios]] ("winding sheet"), depicting the preparation of the body of Jesus for burial]] Near the end of the service an ''[[Epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios]]'' or "winding sheet" (a cloth embroidered with the image of Christ prepared for burial) is carried in procession to a low table in the [[nave]] which represents the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]]; it is often decorated with an abundance of flowers. The epitaphios itself represents the body of Jesus wrapped in a burial shroud, and is a roughly full-size cloth icon of the body of Christ. Then the priest may deliver a [[homily]] and everyone comes forward to venerate the epitaphios. In the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] practice, at the end of Vespers, [[Compline]] is immediately served, featuring a special ''Canon of the Crucifixion of our Lord and the Lamentation of the Most Holy [[Theotokos]]'' by Symeon the Logothete.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

===Matins of Holy and Great Saturday===
[[File:Epitaphios Peleka.jpg|thumb|left|The Epitaphios being carried in [[procession]] in a church in Greece.]]
On Friday night, the Matins of [[Holy and Great Saturday]], a unique service known as '''''The Lamentation at the Tomb''''' (''Epitáphios Thrēnos'') is celebrated. This service is also sometimes called ''Jerusalem Matins''. Much of the service takes place around the tomb of Christ in the center of the nave.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

A unique feature of the service is the chanting of the Lamentations or Praises (''[[Encomium|Enkōmia]]''), which consist of verses chanted by the clergy interspersed between the verses of [[Psalm 119]] (which is, by far, the longest [[psalm]] in the Bible). The ''Enkōmia'' are the best-loved hymns of Byzantine hymnography, both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited to each other and to the spirit of the day. They consist of 185 [[tercet]] [[antiphon]]s arranged in three parts (''stáseis'' or "stops"), which are interjected with the verses of Psalm 119, and nine short ''doxastiká'' ("[[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloriae]]") and ''Theotókia'' (invocations to the Virgin Mary). The three ''stáseis'' are each set to its own music, and are commonly known by their initial antiphons: {{lang|grc|Ἡ ζωὴ ἐν τάφῳ}}, "Life in a grave", {{lang|grc|Ἄξιον ἐστί}}, "Worthy it is", and {{lang|grc|Αἱ γενεαὶ πᾶσαι}}, "All the generations".  Musically they can be classified as [[strophic]], with 75, 62, and 48 tercet [[stanza]]s each, respectively. The climax of the ''Enkōmia'' comes during the third ''stásis'', with the antiphon "''Ō glyký mou Éar''", a lamentation of the Virgin for her dead Child ("O, my sweet spring, my sweetest child, where has your beauty gone?"). The author(s) and date of the ''Enkōmia'' are unknown. Their High Attic linguistic style suggests a dating around the 6th century, possibly before the time of [[St. Romanos the Melodist]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Epitaph Adelaide.jpg|thumb|The Epitaphios mounted upon return of procession, at an Orthodox Church in Adelaide, Australia.]]
At the end of the [[Great Doxology]], while the [[Trisagion]] is sung, the epitaphios is taken in [[crucession|procession]] around the outside the church, and is then returned to the tomb. Some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door, above waist level, so the faithful most bow down under it as they come back into the church, symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ. The epitaphios will lay in the tomb until the Paschal Service early Sunday morning. In some churches, the epitaphios is never left alone, but is accompanied 24 hours a day by a reader chanting from the Psalter.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The [[Troparion]] (hymn of the day) of Good Friday is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The noble [[Joseph of Arimathea|Joseph]], when he had taken down Thy most pure Body from the [[Tree of Life (Judeo-Christian)|tree]], wrapped it in fine linen, and anointed it with spices, and placed it in a new tomb.
Glory to the [[God the Father|Father]], and to the [[Jesus|Son]], and to the [[Holy Spirit]], both now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.
The angel came to the [[myrrh-bearing women]] at the tomb and said:
[[Myrrh]] is fitting for the dead, but Christ has shown Himself a stranger to corruption.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Day of Fasting===
[[File:St.Martin-Karfreitag36.JPG|thumb|[[Crucifix]] prepared for veneration]]
The Catholic Church regards Good Friday and [[Holy Saturday]] as the Paschal fast, in accord with Article 110 of [[Sacrosanctum Concilium]].&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html|title=Sacrosanctum concilium|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Latin Church]], a [[Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church|fast day]] is understood as having only one full meal and two [[Collation (meal)|collations]] (a smaller repast, the two of which together do not equal the one full meal)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/liturgical-year/lent/catholic-information-on-lenten-fast-and-abstinence.cfm|title=Fast &amp; Abstinence|website=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|language=en|access-date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/Penance/Abstinence.pdf|title=Fasting and Abstinence|date=24 January 1985|website=Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales|access-date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; – although this may be observed less stringently on Holy Saturday than on Good Friday.&lt;ref name="vatican.va"/&gt;

===Services on the day===
The [[Roman Rite]] has no celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] between the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]] evening and the [[Easter Vigil]] unless a special exemption is granted for rare solemn or grave occasions by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] or the [[Ordinary (officer)|local bishop]]. The only [[sacrament]]s celebrated during this time are [[Baptism]] (for those in danger of death), [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]], and [[Anointing of the Sick]].&lt;ref&gt;Roman Missal: Good Friday, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no celebration of the Eucharist, it is distributed to the faithful only in the Service of the Passion of the Lord, but can also be taken at any hour to the sick who are unable to attend this service.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Missal: Good Friday, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Lord's Supper any candlesticks and [[altar cloth]]s, cross or crosses are removed leaving it bare so that they may be returned in-ceremony on Easter Sunday which memorialises the day of Christ's resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Missal, Good Friday, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also customary to empty the [[holy water]] [[holy water font|fonts]] in preparation of the blessing of the water at the Easter Vigil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/LawText/Index/6/LawIndex/46|title=Removing Holy Water During Lent.

The Celebration of the Passion of the Lord takes place in the afternoon, ideally at three o'clock; however, for pastoral reasons (especially in countries where Good Friday is not a public holiday), it is permissible to celebrate the liturgy earlier, even shortly after midday, or at a later hour up until 9pm.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Missal: Good Friday, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/2/SubIndex/38/ContentIndex/325/Start/319|title= V.

[[File:Ecce Mass, Good Friday, Our Lady of Lourdes, Philadelphia.jpg|thumb|right|Communion from the [[Blessed Sacrament]] on Good Friday (Our Lady of Lourdes, Philadelphia)]]

The Good Friday liturgy consists of three parts: the [[Liturgy of the Word]], the [[Veneration of the Cross]], and [[Holy Communion]].
* The '''Liturgy of the Word''' consists of the clergy and assisting ministers entering in complete silence, without any singing. They then silently make a full [[prostration]]. This signifies the abasement ([[Fall of man|the fall]]) of (earthly) humans.&lt;ref name="Pope Francis prostrating"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3509799/Pope-Francis-lies-prostrate-floor-St-Peter-s-Basilica-Vatican-pray-silently-Good-Friday-service-sharing-picture-kissing-crucifix-Instagram.html|title=Pope Francis slams Europe's attitude to migrants|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Missal'', "Good Friday", Celebration of the Lord's Passion, n. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It also symbolizes the grief and sorrow of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;''Circular Letter Concerning the Preparation and Celebration of the Easter Feasts'', [http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/6/SubIndex/97/ContentIndex/325/Start/319 V. Good Friday], 16 January 1988, Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship.&lt;/ref&gt; Then follows the [[Collect]] prayer, and the reading or chanting of {{Bibleverse||Isaiah|52:13–53:12}}, {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|4:14–16}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|5:7–9}}, and the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] account from the [[Gospel of John]], traditionally divided between three deacons,&lt;ref&gt;Congregation of Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments, ''Paschale Solemnitatis'', III, n.66 (cf. n. 33)&lt;/ref&gt; yet usually divided between the celebrant, one or two singers or readers, and the congregation which speaks the part of the "crowd". This part of the liturgy concludes with the ''orationes sollemnes'', a series of prayers for the Church, the Pope, the clergy and laity of the Church, those preparing for baptism, the unity of Christians, the Jewish people, those who do not believe in Christ, those who do not believe in God, those in public office, those in special need.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Missal: Good Friday, 7–13.&lt;/ref&gt; After each prayer intention, the deacon calls the faithful to kneel for a short period of private prayer; the celebrant then sums up the prayer intention with a Collect-style prayer.
* The '''Adoration of the Cross''' has a [[crucifix]], not necessarily the one that is normally on or near the altar at other times of the year, solemnly unveiled and displayed to the congregation, and then venerated by them, individually if possible and usually by kissing the wood of the cross, while hymns and the [[Improperia]] ("Reproaches") with the [[Trisagion]] hymn are chanted.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Missal: Good Friday, 14–21.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Holy Communion''' is done according to a rite based on that of the final part of Mass, beginning with the [[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]], but omitting the ceremony of "[[Fraction (religion)|Breaking of the Bread]]" and its related chant, the "[[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]]". The [[Eucharist]], consecrated at the Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], is distributed at this service.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Missal: Good Friday, 22–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the reform of [[Pope Pius XII]], only the priest received Communion in the framework of what was called the "[[Mass of the Presanctified]]", which included the usual Offertory prayers, with the placing of wine in the chalice, but which omitted the [[Canon of the Mass]].&lt;ref name="sanctamissa.org"/&gt; The priest and people then depart in silence, and the altar cloth is removed, leaving the altar bare except for the crucifix and two or four candlesticks.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Missal: Good Friday, 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stations of the Cross===
[[File:GoodFr CroosWay Colloseo.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Way of the Cross]], celebrated at the [[Colosseum]] in Rome on Good Friday]]
[[File:Canopy erected at the Temple of Venus and Rome during Good Friday ceremonies.JPG|thumb|Rome: canopy erected at the "Temple of Venus and Rome" during the "Way of the Cross" ceremony]]

In addition to the prescribed [[liturgy|liturgical]] service, the [[Stations of the Cross]] are often prayed either in the church or outside, and a prayer service may be held from midday to 3.00&amp;nbsp;pm, known as the [[Three Hours' Agony]]. In countries such as Malta, Italy, Philippines, Puerto Rico and Spain, processions with statues representing the Passion of Christ are held.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

In Rome, since the papacy of Saint [[John Paul II]], the heights of the [[Temple of Venus and Roma]] and their position opposite the main entrance to the Colosseum have been used to good effect as a public address platform. This may be seen in the photograph below where a red canopy has been erected to shelter the Pope as well as an illuminated cross, on the occasion of the '''Way of the Cross''' ceremony. The Pope, either personally or through a representative, leads the faithful through meditations on the stations of the cross while a cross is carried from there to the Colosseum.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

In Polish churches, a tableau of Christ's Tomb is unveiled in the sanctuary. Many of the faithful spend long hours into the night grieving at the Tomb, where it is customary to kiss the wounds on the Lord's body. A life-size figure of Jesus lying in his tomb is widely visited by the faithful, especially on Holy Saturday. The tableaux may include flowers, candles, figures of angels standing watch, and the three crosses atop Mt Calvary, and much more. Each parish strives to come up with the most artistically and religiously evocative arrangement in which the Blessed Sacrament, draped in a filmy veil, is prominently displayed.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

===Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ===
{{main|Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ}}
[[File:Christ Carrying the Cross 1580.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[El Greco]]'s ''Jesus Carrying the Cross'', 1580]]
The Roman Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as ''[[acts of reparation]]'' for the sufferings and insults that Jesus suffered during his Passion on Good Friday. These Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ do not involve a petition for a beneficiary, but aim to "repair the sins" against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the [[Holy See]] in 1898) which also includes prayers as [[Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Reparation|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Raccolta|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P. Christopher et al., 2003 ''The Raccolta'' St Athanasius Press {{ISBN|978-0-9706526-6-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices ''{{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his encyclical ''[[Miserentissimus Redemptor]]'' on reparations, [[Pope Pius XI]] called Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ a duty for Catholics and referred to them as "some sort of compensation to be rendered for the injury" with respect to the sufferings of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_08051928_miserentissimus-redemptor_en.html |title=Pius XI, Miserentissimus Redemptor (08/05/1928) |work=vatican.va |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812031528/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_08051928_miserentissimus-redemptor_en.html |archivedate=12 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John Paul II]] referred to [[Acts of Reparation]] as the "unceasing effort to stand beside the endless crosses on which the Son of God continues to be crucified".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_20001021_riparatrici_en.html |title=Letter of the Holy Father John Paul II to Cardinal Fiorenzo Angelini for the 50th Anniversary of the Benedictine Sisters of Reparation of the Holy Face |website=Vatican archives |date=27 September 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502234831/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_20001021_riparatrici_en.html |archivedate=2 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anglican Communion==
The 1662 [[Book of Common Prayer]] did not specify a particular rite to be observed on Good Friday but local custom came to mandate an assortment of services, including the [[Seven Last Words from the Cross]] and a three-hour service consisting of [[Matins]], [[Eucharist|Ante-communion]] (using the [[Reserved Sacrament]] in [[high church]] parishes) and [[Evening Prayer (Book of Common Prayer)|Evensong]]. In recent times,{{When|date=April 2017}} revised editions of the [[Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]] and [[Common Worship]] have re-introduced pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] forms of observance of Good Friday corresponding to those in today's Roman Catholic Church, with special nods to the rites that had been observed in the Church of England prior to the [[English Reformation|Henrican, Edwardian and Elizabethan reforms]], including Creeping to the Cross.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Lutheran Church==
[[File:Chancel of Grace Lutheran Church on Good Friday.jpg|thumb|The [[chancel]] of this Lutheran church is adorned with black [[parament]]s on Good Friday, the liturgical colour associated with Good Friday in the Lutheran Churches.]]
In [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] tradition from the 16th to the 20th century, Good Friday was the most important religious holiday, and abstention from all worldly works was expected. During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].&lt;ref name="GassmannOldenburg2011"/&gt;

More recently, Lutheran liturgical practice has recaptured Good Friday as part of the larger sweep of the great Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Vigil of Easter. The Three Days remain one liturgy which celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus. As part of the liturgy of the Three Days, Lutherans generally fast from the Eucharist on Good Friday. Rather, it is celebrated in remembrance of the [[Last Supper]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] and at the [[Vigil of Easter]]. One practice among Lutheran churches is to celebrate a [[tenebrae]] service on Good Friday, typically conducted in candlelight and consisting of a collection of passion accounts from the four gospels. While being called "Tenebrae" it holds little resemblance to the now-suppressed Catholic monastic rite of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historiclectionary.com/2010/03/a-word-about-tenebrae/ |title=A Word About Tenebrae &amp;#124; |publisher=Historiclectionary.com |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Good Friday liturgy appointed in ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'', the worship book of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, specifies a liturgy similar to the revised Roman Catholic liturgy. A rite for adoration of the crucified Christ includes the optional singing of the Solemn Reproaches in an updated and revised translation which eliminates some of the anti-Jewish overtones in previous versions. Influenced by the ecumenical liturgical renewal movement and in an attempt to recover patterns of worship from the early church, many Lutheran congregations are moving away from long preaching services centered on a dramatic and sentimentalized remembrance of the "Seven Last Words," sayings of Jesus assembled from the four gospels, toward a more devotional practice that places an emphasis on the triumph of the cross, and a singular biblical account of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

Along with observing a general Lenten fast,&lt;ref name="GassmannOldenburg2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gassmann|first1=Günther|last2=Oldenburg|first2=Mark W.|title=Historical Dictionary of Lutheranism|date=10 October 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=9780810874824|page=229|quote=In many Lutheran churches, the Sundays during the Lenten season are called by the first word of their respective Latin Introitus (with the exception of Palm/Passion Sunday): Invocavit, Reminiscere, Oculi, Laetare, and Judica.

Many other mainstream [[Protestant]] communities hold special services on this day as well. [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] hold a [[Lovefeast]] on Good Friday as they receive Holy Communion on [[Maundy Thursday]]. The [[Methodism|Methodist Church]] commemorates Good Friday with [[fasting]],&lt;ref name="BaysWacker2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bays|first1=Daniel H|last2=Wacker|first2=Grant|title=The Foreign Missionary Enterprise at Home: Explorations in North American Cultural History|date=14 March 2010|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=9780817356408|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[service of worship]], often based on the [[Seven Last Words from the Cross]].&lt;ref name="Reflector-Good Friday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reflector.com/local/content/news/stories/2008/03/21/GoodFriday.html |title=Christians mark Good Friday |publisher=The Daily Reflector |accessdate=21 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330184414/http://www.reflector.com/local/content/news/stories/2008/03/21/GoodFriday.html |archivedate=30 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UMC-Good Friday"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=258&amp;GID=179&amp;GMOD=VWD&amp;GCAT=G| title = Good Friday |publisher = United Methodist Church|accessdate =21 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for some communities to hold interdenominational services on Good Friday.

In the [[Reformed]] tradition, Good Friday is one of the [[evangelical feast]]s and is thus widely observed with [[church service]]s, which feature the Solemn Reproaches in the pattern of [[Psalm 78]], towards the end of the liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rca.org/resources/good-friday|title=Good Friday|publisher=[[Reformed Church in America]]|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Malaysia is a [[Muslim world|Muslim majority country]], Good Friday is declared as a public holiday in the states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in [[East Malaysia]] as there is a significant Christian indigenous population in both states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Ipgrave|title=Building a Better Bridge: Muslims, Christians, and the Common Good : a Record of the Fourth Building Bridges Seminar Held in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 15–18, 2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O109P8UHP2wC&amp;pg=PA109|year=2008|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=1-58901-731-5|pages=109–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===
The Holy Week commemorations reach their peak on Good Friday as the Roman Catholic Church celebrates the passion of Jesus. Solemn celebrations take place in all churches together with processions in different villages around [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]]. During the celebration, the narrative of the passion is read in some localities, while the Adoration of the Cross follows. Good Friday processions take place in [[Birgu]], [[Bormla]], [[Għaxaq]], [[Luqa]], [[Mosta]], [[Naxxar]], [[Paola, Malta|Paola]], [[Qormi]], [[Rabat]], [[Senglea]], [[Valletta]], [[Żebbuġ, Malta|Żebbuġ (Città Rohan)]] and [[Żejtun]]. Processions in Gozo will be in [[Nadur]], [[Victoria, Gozo|Victoria]] (St. George and Cathedral), [[Xagħra]] and [[Żebbuġ, Gozo]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

===Philippines===
In the predominantly [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]] [[Philippines]], the day is commemorated with street processions, the [[Way of the Cross]], the chanting of the ''[[Pasyon|Pasyón]]'', and performances of the ''Senákulo'' or [[Passion play]]. Some devotees engage in self-[[Flagellant|flagellation]] and even have themselves [[Crucifixion in the Philippines|crucified]] as expressions of penance despite health risks and strong disapproval from the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/dozens-ignore-warnings-to-reenact-crucifixion-799322.html|title=Dozens ignore warnings to re-enact crucifixion|date=22 March 2008|accessdate=23 March 2008|work=[[The Independent]] | location=London | first1=Kathy | last1=Marks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Church bells are not rung and Masses are not celebrated, while television features movies, documentaries and other shows focused on the religious event and other topics related to the Catholic faith, broadcasting mostly religious content. Malls and shops are generally closed, as are restaurants as it is the second of three public holidays within the week.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

After three o'clock in the afternoon (the time at which Jesus is traditionally believed to have died), the faithful venerate the cross in the local church and follow the procession of the Burial of Jesus. The image of the dead Christ is then laid in state to be venerated, and sometimes treated in accordance with local burial customs.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

In [[Cebu]] and many parts of the [[Visayan Islands]], people usually eat ''[[binignit]]'' and ''[[Cuisine of the Philippines#Merienda|biko]]'' as a form of [[fasting]].&lt;ref&gt;Izobelle T. Pulgo, "[http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/90044/90044 Binignit: A Good Friday Cebuano soul food]", ''Cebu Daily News'', 23 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deralyn Ramos, "[http://www.thici.com/sites/default/files/news/thibalita_march2013.pdf Holy Week in tne Philippines]", ''Tsuneishi Balita'', March 2013, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[UK]], Good Friday was historically a common law holiday and is recognised as an official public holiday&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_073741| title =Bank holidays and British Summer Time |publisher = Directgov|accessdate =19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as a [[Bank Holiday]]). All state schools are closed and most businesses treat it as a holiday for staff; however, many retail stores now remain open. [[Northern Ireland Civil Service|Government]] services in Northern Ireland operate as normal on Good Friday, substituting [[Easter Tuesday]] for the holiday.

There has traditionally been no horse racing on Good Friday in the UK. However, in 2008, betting shops and stores opened for the first time on this day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1582366/Good-Friday-gambling-angers-churches.html|title=Good Friday gambling angers churches|work=The Telegraph|first=Jonathan|last=Petre|date=21 March 2008|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014 Lingfield Park and Musselburgh staged the UK's first Good Friday race meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/24458664|title=Lingfield: £1m Good Friday fixture to be held at Surrey racecourse|work=BBC news|date=9 October 2013|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/musselburgh-to-host-historic-good-friday-racing-1-3136748|work=The Scotsman|title=Musselburgh to host historic Good Friday racing|first=Craig|last=Brown|date=11 October 2013|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] has for many years introduced its 7&amp;nbsp;am News broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] on Good Friday with a verse from [[Isaac Watts]]' hymn "[[When I Survey the Wondrous Cross]]".

O'Bannon'', an Indiana state employee sued the governor for giving state employees Good Friday as a day off. The US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the plaintiff, stating that the government could give state employees a paid day off when that day is a religious holiday, including Good Friday, but only so long as the state can provide a valid secular purpose that coincides with the obvious religious purpose of the holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/good-friday|title=Good Friday in the United States|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good Friday is the Friday before Easter, which is calculated differently in [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Western Christianity]] (see [[Computus]] for details). Easter falls on the first Sunday following the [[Paschal Full Moon]], the full moon on or after 21 March, taken to be the date of the vernal [[equinox]]. The Western calculation uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], while the Eastern calculation uses the [[Julian calendar]], whose 21 March now corresponds to the Gregorian calendar's 3 April. The calculations for identifying the date of the full moon also differ. See [[Computus]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

In Eastern Christianity, Easter can fall between 22 March and 25 April on Julian Calendar (thus between 4 April and 8 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar, during the period 1900 and 2099), so Good Friday can fall between 20 March and 23 April, inclusive (or between 2 April and 6 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar).{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Cultural references==
Good Friday assumes a particular importance in the plot of [[Richard Wagner]]'s music drama ''[[Parsifal]]'', which contains an orchestral interlude known as the "Good Friday Music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/good-friday-music|title=Good Friday Music – Dictionary definition of Good Friday Music – Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism from non-observers==
Some [[Baptist]] congregations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=L. K.|last=Landis  |url=http://www.kjbbc.com/wednesdaycrucifix.html |title=Proof for a Wednesday Crucifixion |publisher=King James Bible Baptist Church, Ladson, South Carolina |date=8 June 1998 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philadelphia Church of God]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetrumpet.com/index.php?q=4758.3049.102.0 |title=The Resurrection Was Not on Sunday |website=thetrumpet.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418010828/http://www.thetrumpet.com/index.php?q=4758.3049.102.0 |archivedate=18 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational]] churches oppose the observance of Good Friday, regarding it as a [[papist]] tradition, and instead observe the [[Crucifixion]] on Wednesday to coincide with the Jewish sacrifice of the [[Passover]] Lamb (which Christians believe is an Old Testament pointer to Jesus Christ). A Wednesday Crucifixion of Jesus allows for him to be in the tomb ("heart of the earth") for three days and three nights as he told the Pharisees he would be ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 12:40), rather than two nights and a day (by [[Counting#Inclusive counting|inclusive counting]], as was the norm at that time) if he had died on a Friday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebereancall.org/node/5889 |title=The Cradle &amp; the Cross (original) |publisher=thebereancall.org |date=1 December 1992 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factnet.org/discus/messages/3/19941.html |website=factnet.org |title=Cult, Cults, Abuse by Religions, Abuse Recovery Discussion &amp; Resources, Peer-Support, Legal support |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416103539/http://www.factnet.org/discus/messages/3/19941.html |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparation Day (14 [[Nisan]] on the [[Hebrew calendar]]) – which is the day before Passover (15 Nisan), instead of the Friday morning as the [[Synoptic Gospel]]s refer to the sabbath and they believe this refers to a "high sabbath" which occurs on feast days, and not the ordinary weekly sabbath.

The '''International Alpine Trial''' (''"Coupe Internationale des Alpes"'') was a [[Regularity rally|"Time-Speed-Distance" motor sport rally]] held annually (with exceptions) between 1928 and 1936.   It was one of the earliest international motorsport event of its kind and covered a distance of approximately 2,000 kilometers over an [[The Alps|Alpine]] route, usually including Italy, France, Switzerland and, till [[Machtergreifung|1933]], Austria and Germany.&lt;ref name="Pfundner2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Pfundner|title=Alpine Trials &amp; Rallies: 1910 - 1973|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNtwhCL2scgC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2005|publisher=Veloce Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1-904788-95-9|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!---
La Coupe Internationale des Alpes était une épreuve de rallye devenue française dite "de régularité", se déroulant annuellement pendant l'entre-deux-guerres en montagne, dans les Alpes. Elle fut en partie organisée par l'Automobile Club de France, pour les dernières courses.
---&gt;

== History ==
The event took place eight times between 1928 and 1936, over seven different routes.

* No trial was organised in 1930.   The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street Crash in October 1929]] had been accompanied by [[Great Depression|bank collapses and business closures]] across Europe.   The "International Alpine Trial" was not the only sporting event that failed to take place in 1930.

* The 1935 event was cancelled because of the rapidly deteriorating political situation, notably between France and Italy.   [[Mussolini]]'s [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invasion of Abyssinia]] had led to [[League of Nations]] sanctions against [[Italy]].  On the northern side of the Alps, the [[Nazi Germany|German]] government had for its own reasons recently introduced transit and currency restrictions which made it impractical to include Germany in the route.

=== 1928 ===
Approximately 100 crews registered for the 1928 event which was held during the third week in August.   Of these, 86 started from [[Milan]] and 44 crossed the finishing line in [[Munich]] after covering a notional 1,964 kilometers over 7 days.  There were no prizes for drivers/crews:  the four champion constructors were [[Adler (automobile)|Adler]], [[Brennabor]], [[Minerva (automobile)|Minerva]] and [[Officine Meccaniche|O.M.]].&lt;ref name=CIAselonDan1928&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamdan.com/archive/www2/miscral/28miscra.html|work=1928 Miscellaneous Rallies|publisher=Team DAN website|author=Daniel King (compiler)|title= I Coupe Internationale des Alpes  12-18 August 1928|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1929 ===
36 crews arrived at the finishing post in [[Como]] without attracting penality points, having completed a course of 2,518 kilometers.   They were all rewarded with "Alpine cups".   80 teams (out of 95 who had registered) departed from [[Munich]]:  48 of these completed the course without exceeding the permitted quota of penalty points.   Two "Alpine cups" were awarded to manufacturers:  [[Hansa (company)|Hansa]] and [[BMW]].&lt;ref name=CIAselonDan1929&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamdan.com/archive/www2/miscral/29miscra.html|work=1929 Miscellaneous Rallies|publisher=Team DAN website|author=Daniel King (compiler)|title= II Coupe International des Alpes  7-11 August 1929|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Georg Kimpel, driving one of the two [[Mercedes-Benz SSK]]s won the two [[Hillclimbing|special hillclimbing sections]] - trials of pure performance - which covered the [[:fr:Course de côte du Col du Stelvio|Stelvio]] [[Stelvio Pass|Pass]] and the [[Pordoi Pass]].

The Iraqi '''Kurdish Civil War''' was a military conflict that took place between rival [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] factions in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] during the mid-1990s, most notably between the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] and the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]]. Over the course of the conflict, Kurdish factions from Iran and Turkey, as well as Iranian, Iraqi and Turkish forces were drawn into the fighting, with additional involvement from the American forces. Between 3,000 and 5,000 fighters and civilians were killed. According to some estimates however, upwards of 8,000 civilians alone could have been killed throughout the more than three years of warfare.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Background==
Autonomy in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] was originally established in 1970 as the ''Kurdish Autonomous Region'' following the agreement of an Autonomy Accord between the government of Iraq and leaders of the Iraqi [[Kurds|Kurdish]] community. A Legislative Assembly was established in the city of Erbil with nominal authority over the Kurdish-populated governorates of [[Erbil Governorate|Erbil]], [[Dohuk Governorate|Dahuk]] and [[As Sulaymaniyah Governorate|As Sulaymaniyah]]. As various battles between separatist Kurds and Iraqi government forces continued until the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq]], the safety of Kurdish refugees led to the adoption of [[United Nations Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 688|Resolution 688]] which was used as a justification to implement [[Operation Provide Comfort]], a multilateral military operation that ensured the security of the Iraqi Kurdish region through the use of air power while simultaneously providing humanitarian aid to refugees fleeing persecution.&lt;ref&gt;L. Fawcett, ''Down but not out? The Kurds in International Politics'', Reviews of International Studies, Vol.27, 2001 p.117&lt;/ref&gt; While the no-fly zone covered Dahuk and Erbil, it left out Sulaymaniyah and Kirkuk. This led to a further series of bloody clashes between Iraqi forces and Kurdish troops. Shortly thereafter, an uneasy balance of power was reached, and Iraq withdrew its military and government officials from the region in October 1991. From that point on, Iraqi Kurdistan had achieved ''de facto'' independence under the leadership of two principal Kurdish parties – the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|Kurdish Democratic Party]] and the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] – free from the control of [[Baghdad]]. The region then adopted its own flag and national anthem.

Iraqi Kurdistan held [[Iraqi Kurdistan parliamentary election, 1992|parliamentary elections]] in 1992. The KDP gained an absolute majority of the votes in the [[Governorates of Iraq|governorates]] of [[Dohuk Governorate|Dohuk]] and [[Arbil Province|Arbil]], whereas the PUK garnered the broad support of the [[Sulaymaniyah Governorate|Sulaymaniyah]] governorate as well as the Kurdish portions of [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala]] (specifically the [[Kifri District|Kifri]] and [[Khanaqin District]]s). As a result of the election, the Kurdish parliament had been evenly split between [[Jalal Talabani]]'s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and [[Massoud Barzani]]'s Kurdish Democratic Party.&lt;ref name="slate.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Politi |first=Daniel |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1032/ |title=The Kurds - Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date= |accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After withdrawing its forces from Kurdistan in October 1991, the Iraqi government imposed an economic blockade over the region, restricting its oil and food supplies.&lt;ref&gt;M. Leezenberg, ''Iraqi Kurdistan: contours of a post-civil war society'', Third World Quarterly, Vol.26, No.4-5, June 2005, p.636&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations embargo on Iraq also significantly affected the Kurdish economy, preventing trade between the Kurds and other nations. As such, all economic dealings between Iraqi Kurdistan and the outside world were done through the [[black market]].

==1994 PUK–KDP clashes==
{{main|May 1994 PUK–KDP clashes}}

Fighting broke out between the two factions in May 1994. The clashes left around 300 people dead.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/kdp.htm |title=Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next year, around 2,000 people were killed on both sides.&lt;ref name="slate.com"/&gt; According to CIA agent [[Robert Baer]], members of the Iranian [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] provided limited support to the KDP and allowed the KDP to launch attacks from Iranian territory.

==Planned assassination of Saddam Hussein==
In January 1995, CIA case officer [[Robert Baer]] traveled to northern Iraq with a five-man team to set up a CIA station. He made contact with the Kurdish leadership and managed to negotiate a truce between Barzani and Talabani.

Within days, Baer made contact with an Iraqi general who was plotting to assassinate [[Saddam Hussein]]. His plan was to use a unit of 100 renegade Iraqi troops to kill Saddam as he passed over a bridge near Tikrit. Baer cabled the plan to Washington but did not hear anything back. After three weeks, the plan was revised, calling for an attack by Kurdish forces in northern Iraq while rebel Iraqi troops leveled one of Saddam's houses with tank fire in order to kill the Iraqi leader. Baer again cabled the plan to Washington and received no response. On 28 February, the Iraqi Army was placed on full alert. In response, the Iranian and Turkish militaries were also placed on high alert. Baer received a message directly from National Security Advisor [[Tony Lake]] telling him his operation was compromised. This warning was passed on to the Kurdish and Iraqi allies. With this new information, Barzani backed out of the planned offensive, leaving Talabani's PUK forces to carry it out alone.

The Iraqi Army officers planning to kill Saddam with tank fire were compromised, arrested and executed before they could carry out the operation. The PUK's offensive was still launched as planned, and within days they managed to destroy three Iraqi Army divisions and capture 5,000 prisoners.&lt;ref name="wmassociation.com"&gt;[http://www.wmassociation.com/reports/spkers/baer.html Robert Baer speech at World Media Association]  {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20070816094817/http://www.wmassociation.com/reports/spkers/baer.html |date=16 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Baer's pleas for American support of the offensive, none was offered, and the Kurdish troops were forced to withdraw. Baer was immediately recalled from Iraq and briefly investigated for the attempted murder of [[Saddam Hussein]]. He would later be cleared.&lt;ref name="wmassociation.com"/&gt;

==[[Battle of Erbil (1996)]]==
Although the Kurdish parliament ceased to meet in May 1996, the fragile cease-fire between the PUK and KDP held until the summer of 1996. During this period, the Iraqi government was permitted by the KDP to establish a smuggling route through the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] basin for the transportation of illegal petroleum exports.&lt;ref name=TTS1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pollack|first1=Kenneth|title=The Threatening Storm: What Every American Needs to Know Before an Invasion in Iraq|date=25 March 2003|publisher=Random House LLC, 2003|isbn=9781588363411|page=81|edition=The Case for Invading Iraq: An Excerpt from The Threatening Storm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HCZfUV-U97kC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6vPivVVOt_&amp;sig=hX-9bcgfdd2M-aiaCt2IjW0HmxU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WR2qU9L2L4OYyASTyILgDA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barzani and his associates seized the opportunity to impose taxation on this trade, giving them the means to earn several million dollars per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stansfield |first=G. |last2=Anderson |first2=L. |title=The Future of Iraq: Dictatorship, Democracy, or Division? |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |year=2004 |page=174 |isbn=1403963541}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a dispute with the PUK over the beneficiaries of Kurdish imports and exports. Although the two parties reached an agreement where the Iraqi–Turkish smuggling routes would be divided evenly between each other, the KDP continued its attempts to exert greater control over the movement of goods through Kurdistan.&lt;ref name=TTS1 /&gt;

Talabani established an alliance with Iran, permitting them to conduct a military incursion into northern Iraq aimed at the [[Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran]] on 28 July.&lt;ref name="slate.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/kdpi.htm |title=Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI) |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with the prospect of fighting both Iran and the PUK, [[Massoud Barzani]] asked for assistance from [[Saddam Hussein]]. Seeing an opportunity to retake northern Iraq, Saddam accepted. On 31 August, 30,000 Iraqi troops, spearheaded by an armored division of the [[Iraqi Republican Guard]] attacked the PUK-held city of [[Erbil]], which was defended by 3,000 PUK Peshmerga led by Korsat Rasul Ali, in conjunction with KDP forces. Erbil was captured, and Iraqi troops executed 700 [[prisoner of war|captured]] soldiers of the PUK and the [[Iraqi National Congress]] dissident group in a field outside Erbil.

This attack stoked American fears that Saddam intended to launch a genocidal campaign against the Kurds similar to the campaigns of [[Al-Anfal Campaign|1988]] and [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|1991]]. This move also placed Saddam in clear violation of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 688]] forbidding repression of Iraq's ethnic minorities. In response, the Clinton administration began [[Operation Desert Strike]] on 3 September, when American ships and [[B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers launched 27 cruise missiles at Iraqi air defense sites in southern Iraq. The next day, 17 more cruise missiles were launched from American ships against Iraqi air defense sites. The United States also deployed strike aircraft and an aircraft carrier to the [[Persian Gulf]] region, and the extent of the southern no-fly zone was moved northwards to the [[33rd parallel north|33rd parallel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/desert_strike.htm |title=Operation Desert Strike |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Details|Operation Desert Strike}}

After installing the KDP in control of Erbil, Iraqi troops withdrew from the Kurdish region back to their initial positions. The KDP drove the PUK from its other strongholds, and with additional Iraqi help captured Sulaymaniyah, on 9 September. Jalal Talabani and the PUK retreated to the Iranian border, and American forces evacuated 700 Iraqi National Congress personnel and 6,000 pro-Western Kurds out of northern Iraq.&lt;ref name="slate.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"/&gt; On 13 October, Sulaymaniyah was recaptured by the PUK, allegedly with support of Iranian forces.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,MARP,,IRQ,,469f38a6c,0.html|title=Refworld - Chronology for Kurds in Iraq|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld|accessdate=1 May 2016|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017070825/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CMARP%2C%2CIRQ%2C%2C469f38a6c%2C0.html|archivedate=17 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkish intervention==
{{main|Operation Hammer (1997)|Operation Dawn (1997)}}

Fighting continued throughout the winter between the KDP and PUK. Complicating matters, PKK was present in Iraq. PKK was allied with the PUK which later led KDP attack the PKK. According to some sources, the PKK began to fight against all who supported KDP, including some Assyrian and Arab groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/puk.htm |title=Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey which saw the Kurdish Civil war as an opportunity, allied with KDP and launched [[Operation Hammer (1997)|Operation Hammer]] in May, in a violent attempt to force the PKK to leave Iraqi Kurdistan. This operation caused heavy PKK casualties but was unsuccessful. PKK succeeded to keep their camps in Northern Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The State of the Middle East: An Atlas of Conflict and Resolution|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MehRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=KDP+attacked+PKK+1994&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4LYoA6JpQH&amp;sig=jfnfDJT2P7NXlpZck0ZvXK0b_58&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYiIWqrpfLAhXDJJoKHbJXDy4Q6AEIKzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=KDP%20attacked%20PKK%201994&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 1997, Turkish forces re-entered Iraqi Kurdistan and attacked PUK and PKK positions in an attempt to force the PKK to leave Iraqi Kurdistan. However, according to Turkish sources, it was an attempt to bring a cease-fire between the factions. The operation resulted in heavy PKK and PUK casualties. Later a cease-fire was negotiated between the PUK and KDP after the US decision to support a cease-fire.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Despite the cease-fire, renewed fighting broke out along the armistice line between the KDP and PUK in October and November. In this round of fighting, 1,200 combatants were killed on both sides and 10,000 civilians fled their homes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; On 24 November 1997, the KDP declared a unilateral cease-fire. The PUK, although not declaring a cease-fire officially, said their group would respect the truce, despite alleging that the KDP had violated the truce by attacking PUK positions on 25 November.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Iraq kurdish areas 2003 vector.svg|300px|thumb|Division of Kurdistan after the civil war]]

In September 1998, [[Massoud Barzani|Barzani]] and [[Jalal Talabani|Talabani]] signed the U.S.-mediated Washington Agreement establishing a formal peace treaty. In the agreement, the parties agreed to share revenue, share power, deny the use of northern Iraq to the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]], and not allow Iraqi troops into the Kurdish regions. The United States pledged to use military force to protect the Kurds from possible aggression by [[Saddam Hussein]]. At the same time, implementation of the U.N. [[Oil-for-Food Programme]] brought revenue to northern Iraq, allowing for increased standards of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewashingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=1219 |title=Kurdish Agreement Signals New U.S. Commitment |publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy |date=29 September 1998 |accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iraqi Kurdistan became a relatively peaceful region, before the terrorist group [[Ansar al-Islam]] entered the area in December 2001, bringing renewed conflict.

Around a month later, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[Iraq Liberation Act]] into law, providing for military assistance to Iraqi opposition groups, including the PUK and KDP. The KDP estimated that 58,000 of its supporters had been expelled from PUK-controlled regions from October 1996 to October 1997. The PUK says 49,000 of its supporters were expelled from KDP-controlled regions from August 1996 to December 1997.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org" /&gt;

The PUK and KDP later co-operated with American forces during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], routing Iraqi forces with the help of American air power and overrunning much of northern Iraq including the cities of [[Kirkuk]] and [[Mosul]]. After the invasion, Massoud Barzani was later elected president of Iraqi Kurdistan while Jalal Talabani was elected [[President of Iraq]].

Prof '''John William Heslop Harrison''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] [[FRSE]] (1881–1967), was Professor of [[Botany]] at [[Former colleges of Durham University|King's College]], [[Durham University]] (now [[Newcastle University]]). He enjoyed a brilliant career, specialising in the genetics of moths, but is now best remembered for an alleged [[academic fraud]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon 2000"&gt;Michael A. Salmon, Peter Marren, Basil Harley. (2000). ''The Aurelian Legacy: British Butterflies and Their Collectors''. University of California Press. pp. 216–217. {{ISBN|0-520-22963-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in [[Birtley, Tyne and Wear|Birtley]] on 22 January 1881, the son of George Heslop-Harrison, a pattern-maker at Birtley Iron Works. He was educated at [[Bede College]] School in [[Durham, England|Durham]] then Rutherford School for Boys in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]]. His mother was a keen gardener, and other influences such as his uncle, Rev J E Hull, and neighbour, Charles Robson, led him to an early interest in botany and natural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/14/243|title=John William Heslop Harrison. 1881–1967|first=A. D.|last=Peacock|date=1 November 1968|work=rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org|volume=14|pages=243–270|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1968.0011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then studied at Durham College of Science, graduating BSc in 1903. He did further postgraduate study at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle]] gaining an MSc in 1916 and doctorate (DSc) in 1917.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[James Hartley Ashworth]], Sir [[Thomas Hudson Beare]], [[Percy Hall Grimshaw]], and [[James Ritchie (naturalist)|James Ritchie]]. He served as the Society's Vice-President 1945–1948. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]] in 1928.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

He died in [[Birtley, Tyne and Wear]] on 23 January 1967.

==Career==

From 1903 to 1905 he was a schoolmaster in [[Gateshead]] and then until 1917 in [[Middlesbrough]].

In 1917 he began lecturing in Genetics and Botany at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle]] being given a professorship in 1927. He remained in this role until retiring in 1946.

===Isle of Rum===

In 1948 he was accused by [[John Raven]], a [[University of Cambridge]] classics tutor, of making false claims to have discovered certain plant species on the [[Isle of Rum]] on the west coast of [[Scotland]]. Whether or not such grasses were on Rum is pivotal to a theory that the islands escaped the last [[ice age]]. The fraud claim is described – and its veracity supported – in [[Karl Sabbagh]]'s book, ''A Rum Affair''.&lt;ref name="rumaffair"&gt;Sabbagh, Karl. (1999). ''A Rum Affair''. London: Allen Lane, The Penguin Press. {{ISBN|0-7139-9277-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 further proof about the forgeries committed by Heslop-Harrison emerged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3120761/Botanist-John-Heslop-Harrison-faked-rare-plant-discoveries.html "Botanist John Heslop Harrison faked rare plant discoveries"]. Alastair Jamieson, The Daily Telegraph, 2 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article4863866.ece "The botanist, the Ice Age flora and seeds of doubt"]. Magnus Linklater, The Times, 2 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jul/25/robinmckie.theobserver "Botanical fraudster who planted the evidence is weeded out"]. Robin McKie, ''The Guardian''. 25 July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lamarckian experiments===

Heslop Harrison was described as a loner who avoided as much contact as possible with other professionals and conducted most of his experiments at his home in [[Birtley, Tyne and Wear]].&lt;ref name="Salmon 2000"/&gt; He was a supporter of [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] evolution from his experiments with [[moth]]s and [[sawfly|sawflies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowler|Bowler, Peter J]]. (1983). ''The Eclipse of Darwinism: Anti-Darwinian Evolutionary Theories in the Decades Around 1900''. p. 103. Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|978-0801843914}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to researcher Michael A. Salmon "Heslop Harrison claimed to have experimental proof that physical changes in the life of an individual moth or sawfly could be passed on to its progeny, according to the theory of Lamarck... For example, Heslop Harrison thought that melanism resulted from the effect of pollution on individual moths which somehow altered their genes. When others attempted to repeat his experiment, however, they always seemed to come up with different results."&lt;ref name="Salmon 2000"/&gt;

In the 1920s, Heslop Harrison conducted experiments on the [[peppered moth]], claiming to have evidence for the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]]. Other scientists failed to replicate his results.&lt;ref&gt;Giltrow, Janet. (2002). ''Academic Reading, Second Edition: Reading and Writing Across the Disciplines''. Broadview Press. p. 144. {{ISBN|1-55111-393-7}} "During the 1920s, the entomologist J. W. Heslop-Harrison published experimental data supporting his claim that chemicals in soot caused widespread mutations from light winged to the dark winged form. Because these mutations were supposedly passed on to subsequent generations, Harrison claimed that he had documented a case of inheritance of acquired traits. Other biologists failed to replicate Harrison's results, and R. A. Fisher pointed out that Harrison's hypothesis required a mutation rate far higher than any previously reported."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Randy; Decker, Mark D. (2008). ''More Than Darwin: An Encyclopedia of the People and Places of the Evolution-creationism Controversy''. Greenword Press. p. 203 {{ISBN|978-0313341557}} "In the 1920s, British entomologist J.W Heslop Harrison (1881–1967) claimed that pigmentation of these moths was a result of Lamarckism. However, scientists could not repeat Harrison's work, and evolutionary biologists such as Ronald Fisher argued that Harrison's explanation required much higher rates of mutation than had been reported."&lt;/ref&gt; His experiments were criticised by [[J. B. S. Haldane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haldane | first1 = J. B. S. | year = 1932 | title = The Hereditary Transmission of Acquired Characters | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 129 | issue = | pages = 856–858 | doi=10.1038/129856a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1906 he married Christian Watson Henderson. Their eldest son was [[George Heslop-Harrison]] [[FRSE]] who also came to fame as an entomologist.

Heslop Harrison's fourth son was [[Jack Heslop-Harrison]] who became director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] in 1970. His daughter Helena married the botanist [[William Andrew Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf "Former Fellows of The Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''King Opera House''' is a performance hall located on [[Van Buren, Arkansas]]'s Main Street. Since it was built in the late 19th century, the [[opera house]]'s stage has hosted many plays and performers. The King Opera House is a contributing property to the [[Van Buren Historic District]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NRISref|2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-era]] structure first opened its doors in the late 19th century, and has since undergone extensive restoration prior to reopening for use in 1979.  The auditorium of the opera house has numerous seats on ground level, with additional seating in the balcony; all with an intricate, period-correct design.  Built for large and well-sized performances on its stage, the opera house's basement, in contrast, has two couches and two small closet-sized dressing rooms.  The basement can be highly cramped, in its relatively modest changing area and [[green room]], particularly for productions with large casts.

The '''Kuwaiti protests''' refers to the series of 2011–12 demonstrations for government reforms in the state of [[Kuwait]]. In November 2011, the [[government of Kuwait]] resigned in response to the protests, making Kuwait one of several countries affected by the [[Arab Spring]] to experience major governmental changes due to unrest. The protests began with [[Bedoon|stateless people (Bedoon)]].

==Timeline==

===Stateless protests (early 2011)===
[[Sabah Al-Sabah]], the [[Emir of Kuwait]], gave every Kuwaiti citizen 1,000 [[Kuwaiti dinar|dinars]] (3580 $) and a free food grant for one year on 18 January 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=After the Revolution, Economic Reform|work=The Wall Street Journal |author=Carl Schramm|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704268104576107660043625644|date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; officially to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Kuwait's liberation from occupying [[History of Iraq (1968–2003)|Iraqi]] forces during the [[First Gulf War]], as well as the 50th anniversary of the state's independence.&lt;ref name="Kuwait"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Kuwaitis' Free Food Grant to Cost $818&amp;nbsp;Million|publisher=KUNA Reports|author=Dahlia Kholaif |date=17 January 2011|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-18/kuwaitis-free-food-grant-to-cost-818-million-kuna-reports.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the grant was not extended to the stateless [[Bedoun]] living in Kuwait. Dozens demonstrated in [[Kuwait City]] on 19 February against their supposed second-class status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/video/stateless-arabs-demonstrate-in-kuwait/CAE0DC2D-AFEA-4036-BD8E-FCE980F21B9B.html?mod=WSJ_Article_Videocarousel_1|title=Stateless Arabs Demonstrate in Kuwait|last=|first=|date=19 February 2011|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition leaders called for further protests in March to pressure Prime Minister [[Nasser Al-Sabah]] to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/02/14/clashes-bahrain-planned-protest-rally/?test=latestnews|title=Clashes in Bahrain before planned protest rally |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=1 February 2010 |accessdate=19 February 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110218091806/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/02/14/clashes-bahrain-planned-protest-rally/?test=latestnews| archivedate= 18 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/168796.html |title=Kuwait braces for PM ouster mass rally |publisher=PressTV |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=11 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715113101/http://www.presstv.com/detail/168796.html |archivedate=15 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stateless people continued to protest into January 2012 despite a protest ban, turning out on 13 and 14 January in slums near [[Kuwait City]] to call for the right to citizenship. On both days, violence broke out, with riot police clashing with stateless demonstrators and arresting several dozen on 13 January and firing tear gas to disperse rally-goers on 14 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Chicago Tribune|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-kuwait-protesttre80d0pe-20120114,0,3018153.story|title=Protesters flout ban in fight to become Kuwaitis|date=14 January 2012|accessdate=15 January 2012}}{{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Kuwait Times|url=http://new.kuwaittimes.net/2012/01/15/police-fire-tear-gas-to-break-up-fresh-demos-citizen-rally-for-second-day-dozens-arrested/|title=Police fire tear gas to break up fresh demos – Citizens rally for second day, dozens arrested|date=15 January 2012|accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riot police on 2 October used tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse hundreds of stateless demonstrators who were demanding citizenship. Witnesses and activists said at least three people, including a policeman, were slightly wounded and 10 stateless were arrested as security forces laid a siege on Taima suburb in [[Al Jahra]] which houses tens of thousands of stateless. The new protest comes a week after three international human rights groups sent an unprecedented letter to Emir Al-Sabah urging him to end alleged abuse against stateless people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kuwait police fire tear gas to break up stateless demo |date=3 October 2012 |publisher=Google News |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i74XPj_5cfbjaYuWJXKMO4nZBMgA?docId=CNG.8b2b456bdc514b0dd075381637648f70.f51 |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012014810/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i74XPj_5cfbjaYuWJXKMO4nZBMgA?docId=CNG.8b2b456bdc514b0dd075381637648f70.f51 |archivedate=12 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political protests (mid 2011–2012)===
On the night of 16 November, demonstrators and several opposition [[member of Parliament|MPs]] stormed the [[National Assembly of Kuwait|National Assembly]], briefly occupying it while singing and shouting slogans calling for Prime Minister [[Nasser Al-Sabah]] to step down. They left after several minutes to rally in the adjacent [[Al-Erada Square]], although riot police attacked several protesters with nightsticks when a smaller group split off and tried to charge the prime minister's residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Aryn|last=Baker|date=17 November 2011|accessdate=18 November 2011|url=http://globalspin.blogs.time.com/2011/11/17/storming-kuwaits-parliament-whats-behind-the-latest-arab-revolt/|title=Storming Kuwait's Parliament: What's Behind the Latest Arab Revolt?|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the Constitutional Court declared on June 2012 that the February 2012 [[National Assembly of Kuwait|National Assembly]] [[Kuwaiti parliamentary election, February 2012|election]] were "illegal" and reinstated the previous pro-government parliament, thousands of Kuwaitis rally in [[Al-Erada Square]] on 26 June to protests against a court ruling that dissolved the opposition-dominated parliament. Demonstrators chanted "we will not surrender", while a prominent opposition MP called for a [[constitutional monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kuwait protest at court ruling dissolving parliament|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18606540|accessdate=25 September 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 August, around 3,000 people, mainly men in traditional Kuwaiti dress, gathered opposite parliament at Al-Erada Square to protest changes to the electoral law which they said could harm the prospects of opposition lawmakers in upcoming elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Westall|first=Sylvia|title=Thousands of Kuwaitis protest electoral law move|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/27/us-kuwait-politics-rally-idUSBRE87Q13Q20120827|accessdate=25 September 2012|agency=Reuters|date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1,500 Kuwaitis took part in a rally late on 10 September to protest against possible changes in the electoral law and call for more democracy. The crowd, which included opposition lawmakers and political activists, gathered outside parliament in a square which has hosted several anti-government demonstrations since late last year. However, the turnout was smaller than previous rallies in the major oil producer and there was only a light police presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Westall|first=Sylvia|title=Kuwaitis rally against government, voting law|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/10/kuwait-politics-rally-idUSL5E8KAC0A20120910|accessdate=25 September 2012|agency=Reuters|date=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of Kuwait opposition supporters rallied on 24 September, a day ahead where the  Constitutional Court is scheduled to rule on next day if the electoral constituency law is in line with the constitution based on a request submitted by the government last month. Around 10,000 people, who filled the seaside square opposite the parliament building, cheered loudly as opposition figures called for an elected government and warned against what they called a politicised ruling. The next day, the Constitutional Court ruled that the Gulf emirate's electoral constituency law was in line with the constitution, rejecting a government appeal. Dozens of opposition activists who were in the court room hailed the verdict and exchanged congratulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kuwait court rejects govt recourse on electoral law|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gJI9bk9NzuXGLH1Sd5dWdgHsWakA?docId=CNG.90d93b2bded630d0d6b10345856eccac.91|accessdate=25 September 2012|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |publisher=[[Google News]]|date=24 September 2012}}{{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October, Kuwaiti security forces detained at least five people, including the son of a prominent opposition figure, at an anti-government protest against possible changes to an election law. Several people were hurt in skirmishes at the rally, attended by at least 3,000 people who defied a request by authorities to cancel the Monday night demonstration. In some of the strongest remarks by an opposition figure, former lawmaker [[Musallam Al-Barrak]] appealed directly to Kuwaiti Emir to avoid "autocratic rule". His speech to the crowd contained extremely rare criticism of the ruler, "In the name of the nation, in the name of the people, we will not let you, your Highness, practice autocratic rule," Barrak told the rally in a speech addressed to the emir, drew repeated chants of "we will not let you, we will not let you" from the crowd. Analysts said his remarks, including the criticism of the emir could spark a strong reaction from the authorities. The son of [[Ahmed Al-Sadoun]], another prominent opposition leader and former parliament speaker, was among those detained during the protest near parliament where several anti-government demonstrations have taken place in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/16/kuwait-politics-protest-idUSL5E8LG12A20121016|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=16 October 2012|title=Five arrested at big Kuwait protest rally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Kuwaiti parliamentary election, December 2012|1 December elections]] which were won by pro-government candidates due to boycotts by the opposition, hundreds of opposition supporters demonstrated in various areas of Kuwait late on 6 December to demand scrapping the newly elected national assembly. Night demonstrations were staged in at least four areas of the state and that riot police used teargas and stun grenades to disperse the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Opposition hits streets in ‘flash’ demos |url=http://news.kuwaittimes.net/2012/12/05/opposition-hits-streets-in-flash-demos/ |accessdate=6 December 2012 |agency=[[Kuwait Times]] |date=4 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208013229/http://news.kuwaittimes.net/2012/12/05/opposition-hits-streets-in-flash-demos/ |archivedate=8 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists clashed with police on the next day as they took to the streets in at least eight areas of the Gulf state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kuwait emir asks outgoing PM to form cabinet|url=http://www.omantribune.com/index.php?page=news&amp;id=132942&amp;heading=Middle%20East|accessdate=6 December 2012|agency=[[Oman Tribune]] |date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands then demonstrated on 8 December to demand dissolving the new elected parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kuwaiti protesters rally to scrap new parliament|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j0GAnCcI0knzihY6cTCAN0vNHOdg?docId=CNG.97b8b23c0bf286d052ca7b78caff4943.751|accessdate=11 December 2012|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=8 December 2012}}{{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 October 2012, former MP Bader al-Dahum was taken into police custody. Khaled al-Tahus, also a former MP, was summoned for questioning by the prosecution service. Later, a group of around 500 people gathered outside the Justice Palace late Thursday night to protest against the detention of the former lawmakers. On the same day, Kuwait's [[Al-Sabah]] royal family issued a rare statement calling for "obedience" to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Westall|first=Sylvia|title=Kuwait's ruling family calls for obedience to the emir|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/18/us-kuwait-politics-arrests-idUSBRE89H1CK20121018|accessdate=19 October 2012|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three former lawmakers were all later released on bail on 23 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kuwait frees on bail opposition ex-MPs, activists|url=http://dailynewsegypt.com/2012/10/23/kuwait-frees-on-bail-opposition-ex-mps-activists/|accessdate=30 October 2012|work=[[Daily News Egypt]]|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local media reported on 24 October that authorities have banned gatherings of more than 20 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aboudi|first=Sami|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/23/us-kuwait-politics-protests-idUSBRE89M0CC20121023|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=23 October 2012|accessdate=24 October 2012|title=Kuwait bans gatherings of more than 20 people amid protests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Life of Galileo''''' ({{Lang-de|Leben des Galilei}}), also known as ''Galileo'', is a play by the twentieth-century [[Germany|German]] [[dramatist]] [[Bertolt Brecht]] with [[incidental music]] by [[Hanns Eisler]]. The play was written in 1938 and received its first theatrical production (in German) at the [[Schauspielhaus Zürich|Zurich Schauspielhaus]], opening on 9 September [[1943 in literature#New drama|1943]]. This production was directed by [[Leonard Steckel]], with [[Scenic design|set-design]] by [[Teo Otto]]. The cast included Steckel himself (as Galileo), [[Karl Paryla]] and [[Wolfgang Langhoff]].

The second (or 'American') version was written in English between 1945–1947 in collaboration with [[Charles Laughton]], and opened at the [[Coronet Theatre (Los Angeles)|Coronet Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] on 30 July 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/feuchtwanger/exhibits/Brecht/Coronet.html |first=Marje |last=Schuetze-Coburn |publisher=Feuchtwanger Memorial Library at the University of Southern California: |title=Bertolt Brecht's ''Galileo'' at the Coronet Theatre, February 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203000448/http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/feuchtwanger/exhibits/Brecht/Coronet.html |archivedate=2012-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by [[Joseph Losey]] and Brecht, with musical direction by [[Serge Hovey]] and set-design by [[Robert Davison (designer)|Robert Davison]]. Laughton played Galileo, with [[Hugo Haas]] as Barberini and [[Frances Heflin]] as Virginia. This production opened at the [[Maxine Elliott's Theatre]] in [[New York City|New York]] on 7 December of the same year.

In 1955, in the wake of the [[Manhattan Project]], Brecht prepared a third version. A production, by the [[Berliner Ensemble]] with [[Ernst Busch (actor)|Ernst Busch]] in the title role, opened in January 1957 at the [[Theater am Schiffbauerdamm]] and was directed by [[Erich Engel]], with set-design by [[Caspar Neher]].&lt;ref name="willett"&gt;Willett (1959, 46–47).&lt;/ref&gt; The play was first published in 1940.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

The action of the play follows the career of the great [[Italians|Italian]] [[natural philosopher]] [[Galileo Galilei]] and the [[Galileo affair]], in which he was tried by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] for the promulgation of his scientific discoveries. The play embraces such themes as the conflict between [[dogmatism]] and [[Science|scientific evidence]], as well as interrogating the values of constancy in the face of oppression.

== Versions of the play ==
After emigrating to the [[United States]] from [[Nazi Germany|Hitler's Germany]] (with stopovers in various other countries in between, among them the [[USSR]]), Brecht translated and re-worked the first version of his play in collaboration with the actor [[Charles Laughton]].&lt;ref&gt;McNeil (2005: 45–47)&lt;/ref&gt; The result of their efforts was the second 'American version' of the play, entitled simply ''Galileo'', which to this day remains the most widely staged version in the English-speaking world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} This version differed in tone from the original, as Brecht felt that the optimistic portrait of the scientific project present in the first version required revision in a post-[[Hiroshima#Atomic bomb|Hiroshima]] world, where science's harmful potential had become more apparent.&lt;ref&gt;McNeil (2005: 63; 111–113)&lt;/ref&gt; This second version formed the basis for Losey's 1975 film adaptation for [[American Film Theatre]] under the title ''[[Galileo (1975 film)|Galileo]]'' with [[Chaim Topol|Topol]] in the title role.

In September 1947, Brecht was subpoenaed in the US by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] for alleged [[communist]] connections. He testified before HUAC on 30 October 1947, and flew to Europe on 31 October. He chose to return to [[East Germany]] and continued to work on the play, now once again in the German language. The final German version premiered at [[Cologne]] in April 1955.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Matej Danter offers a readily-accessible and detailed comparison of the early, the American, and the final German versions.&lt;ref name="danter"&gt;Danter (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] performed a new version of the play based on a "pared down" translation by [[Mark Ravenhill]]; the [[Swan Theatre (Stratford)|Swan Theatre]] production received a favorable review from the veteran theater critic [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]].&lt;ref name=Billington&gt;{{cite news |title=A Life of Galileo – review |last=Billington |first=Michael |date=February 13, 2013 |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/feb/13/life-of-galileo-review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|1636 portrait of Galileo Galilei by [[Giusto Sustermans]]]]
Galileo, an eminent professor and scientist in the 17th century Venetian Republic, is short of money. A prospective student tells him about a novel invention, the telescope ("a queer tube thing"), that is being sold in Amsterdam. Galileo replicates it, and offers it to the Republic as his own creation. He gains an increase in his salary, but within a short time his ruse is discovered.

Galileo then uses the telescope for careful observations of the Moon and the planets, and he discovers the moons orbiting Jupiter. His observations strongly support [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of our [[Solar System]], which is counter both to popular belief and to the doctrine of the powerful [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He furthermore publishes in [[vernacular]] Italian, rather than traditional scientific [[New Latin|Latin]], thus making his work and conclusions more accessible to the common people.

His daughter's engagement to a well-off young man (with whom she is genuinely in love) is broken because of Galileo's reluctance to distance himself from his unorthodox teachings. Galileo is brought to the Vatican in Rome for interrogation by the [[Inquisition#Roman Inquisition|Inquisition]]. Upon being threatened with torture, he recants his teachings. His students are shocked by his surrender in the face of pressure from the church authorities.

Galileo, old and broken, now living under house arrest with a priest monitoring his activities, is visited by one of his former pupils, Andrea. Galileo gives him a book (''[[Two New Sciences]]'') containing all his scientific discoveries, asking him to smuggle it out of Italy for dissemination abroad. Andrea now believes Galileo's actions were heroic and that he just recanted to fool the ecclesiastical authorities. However, Galileo insists his actions had nothing to do with heroism but were merely the result of self-interest.

==Historical background==
The play stays generally faithful to Galileo's science and timeline thereof, but takes significant liberties with his personal life. Galileo did in fact use a telescope, observe the moons of Jupiter, advocate for the heliocentric model, observe [[sunspots]], investigate buoyancy, and write on physics, and did visit the Vatican twice to defend his work, the second time being made to recant his views, and being confined to house arrest thereafter.

One significant liberty that is taken is the treatment of Galileo's daughter Virginia Gamba (Sister [[Maria Celeste]]), who, rather than becoming engaged, was considered unmarriageable by her father and confined to a convent from the age of thirteen (the bulk of the play), and, further, died of dysentery shortly after her father's recantation. However, Galileo was close with Virginia, and they corresponded extensively.

==Allusions==
There are a number of allusions to Galileo's science and to Marxism which are not further elaborated in the play; some of these are glossed below.

The discussion of ''price'' versus ''value'' was a major point of debate in 19th century economics, under the terms [[exchange value]] versus [[use value]]. Within [[Marxian economics]] this is discussed under the [[labor theory of value]].

More subtly, Marx is sometimes interpreted as advocating [[technological determinism]] (technological progress determines social change), which is reflected in the telescope (a technological change) being the root of the scientific progress and hence social unrest.

The mention of tides refers to Galileo's theory that the motion of the Earth caused the tides, which would give the desired physical proof of the Earth's movement, and which is discussed in his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]],'' whose working title was ''Dialogue on the Tides.'' In actuality Galileo was wrong. Kepler correctly believed that the Moon's gravity caused the tides.

The bent wooden rail in scene 13 and the discussion that the quickest distance between two points need not be a straight line (though a straight line offers the ''shortest'' path, the fastest descent of a rolling ball in fact follows a curve) alludes to Galileo's investigation of the [[brachistochrone]] (in the context of the quickest descent from a point to a wall), which he incorrectly believed to be given by a quarter circle. Instead, the brachistochrone is a half [[cycloid]], which was only proven much later with the development of [[calculus]].

|A letter dated April 2012 from Thomas Ilming, curator Waffen und Technik, Vienna Military Museum, who holds the actual Belgium made Browning (FN) M1910 semi-auto pistol caliber .380 acp (9&amp;nbsp;mm kurz) s/n 19074 used by Princip. This semi-automatic pistol design allows the interchangeable barrels/receiver either 9mm kurz or 7.65mm which probably creates some confusion as to caliber, some references state .32 acp (7.65&amp;nbsp;mm). Letter from the Museum in Vienna states emphatically that the caliber of the assassination weapon was 9mm kurz.

'''Lunar Ultraviolet Cosmic Imager''' ('''LUCI''') is a small planned telescope that would be landed on the [[Moon]] to scan the sky in [[near UV]] wavelengths. It is a technology demonstrator developed by the [[Indian Institute of Astrophysics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-bangalore-based-startup-aims-for-the-skies-2007606|title=Bangalore-based startup aims for the skies {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=3 August 2014|work=dna|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014'&gt;"Prospect for UV observations from the Moon".

==Science objectives==

The science objectives of LUCI telescope are primarily to search for transient astronomic events such as [[supernova]]e, [[nova]]e, tidal disruption events by massive [[black hole]]s, and more exotic energetic sources such as [[superluminous supernova]]e and flashes from cosmic collisions which can be very energetic on all scales.&lt;ref name=DNA/&gt;&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'&gt; [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3266.pdf Prospect for UV observations from the Moon]. Margarita Safonova, Joice Mathew, Rekhesh Mohan, A. G. Sreejith, Jayant Murthy, Noah Brosch, Norbert Kappelmann, Arpit Sharma and Rahul Narayan. ''ArXive'' 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

LUCI would also look for faint [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s in the [[Solar System]], especially for [[near-Earth object]]s (NEO) and [[potentially hazardous object]]s.&lt;ref name=DNA/&gt; The aims are focused on UV sources not accessible by the more sensitive large space missions.&lt;ref name=DNA/&gt; 

==Overview==

The Earth's atmosphere absorbs and scatters UV photons, preventing observations of the active Universe. Placing a telescope on the surface of the Moon is advantageous because of its absence of atmosphere and ionosphere offers an unobstructed view of the space in all wavelengths. The Moon surface provides not just a stable platform, but an inexpensive and long-term access to observations in wavelengths not normally used by large orbital telescope missions. The only UV astronomical observations from the Moon to date were made by [[Apollo 16]] team in 1972.&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'/&gt; LUCI project started in 2013 and is funded by the India department of science and technology.&lt;ref name='B Mirror'/&gt; The telescope team is headed by Jayant Murthy.&lt;ref name=DNA&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-bangalore-based-startup-aims-for-the-skies-2007606|title=Bangalore-based startup aims for the skies {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=3 August 2014|work=dna|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===

LUCI is a small technology demonstrator without 3-axis pointing freedom, so it will rely on the motion of the lunar sky.&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'/&gt; The optical system is a two-spherical mirror configuration and a double-pass corrector lens. Its primary lens is all-spherical measuring 30 cm&lt;ref name='Mathew 2017'/&gt; transmitting light through the system to a photon-counting [[Charge-coupled device]] (CCD) detector which is sensitive to ultraviolet wavelengths.&lt;ref name='Sarpotdar 2016'&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.07392.pdf A generic FPGA-based detector readout and real-time image processing board]. Mayuresh Sarpotdar, Joice Mathew, Margarita Safonova and Jayant Murthy. [[Indian Institute of Astrophysics]], Bangalore, India. ''ArXive''. (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Mathew 2017'/&gt; The detector is an 8 mm UV-sensitive CCD with the response between 200 - 900 nm, so the engineers placed a solar blind filter before the CCD to restrict the bandpass to 200 - 320 nm.&lt;ref name='Mathew 2017'/&gt; 

LUCI is planned to be mostly contained within the lander, and it will be lowered back into its storage bay during the cold lunar nights.&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'/&gt; The baseline for LUCI's operation is "a few months".&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'/&gt;

'''''Man's Best Friend''''' is a 1993 [[United States|American]] [[horror comedy film]], directed and written by [[John Lafia]]. It stars [[Ally Sheedy]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Robert Costanzo]], [[Frederic Lehne]], [[John Cassini]], and [[J. D. Daniels]]. It was released by [[New Line Cinema]] on November 19, 1993. The official tagline was "Nature created him. Science perfected him. But no one can control him." The film's soundtrack was composed by [[Joel Goldsmith]] and its reception was mediocre. However, it was a modest success at the box office, grossing $12.9 million behind a $6 million budget.

==Plot==
{{plot|date=September 2016}}

Judy Sanders (Robin Frates), an employee of a genetic research facility named EMAX, contacts television personality Lori Tanner ([[Ally Sheedy]]), planning to meet after work so she can show Lori the atrocities and [[cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]] that go on in EMAX's laboratories. As she proceeds back to work, an animal assailant attacks and kills her before being sedated by Dr. Jarret ([[Lance Henriksen]]), a scientist performing [[vivisection]] and [[Genetic engineering|genetic altering]] and the owner of EMAX. Later, Lori arrives at EMAX, breaks into the laboratory, films the various animals that are being [[experiment]]ed on, and frees a [[Tibetan Mastiff]] named Max before escaping with him. Jarret immediately goes to the police and reports that his dog has been stolen. Later that day, a mugger ([[Thomas Rosales, Jr.]]) steals Lori's purse, but Max chases the thief, brutally kills him, and retrieves the purse.

Unaware that Max killed the mugger, Lori develops a bond with him, much to the disapproval of her boyfriend Perry ([[Fredric Lehne]]), who insists Max must stay in the backyard. However, Max can understand human conversations and becomes protective of Lori. Dr. Jarret is questioned by the police about Max and reveals that Max is a genetically altered dog, spliced with the [[DNA]] of various other [[animal]]s such as [[big cat]]s, [[snake]]s, [[chameleon]]s, and [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]], giving him enhanced strength, speed, and senses. Max is also prone to violent rages, and Jarrett regularly gives him a drug to keep him relaxed, but he fears that it won't be long before the effects of the drug wear off.

Max acts loyal, obedient, and lovable to Lori, but when her back is turned, he starts wreaking havoc in the neighborhood, terrorizing some local children (though he seems all right with Lori's young neighbor Rudy), devouring a [[cat]], destroying the brake lines in Perry's truck, mating with Rudy's collie Heidi, and murdering a [[Mail carrier|mail man]] (Rick Barker). All of these incidents go unnoticed by Lori. Realizing Max is trying to kill him, Perry tries to poison Max, but Max smells the [[poison]] in the [[meat]] and chases Perry out of the house. After Perry escapes in his truck, Max eats Lori's talking pet [[parrot]] and flushes the poisoned meat down the toilet.

Noticing Perry's animosity towards their new dog, Lori decides to find Max a new home. She takes him to a [[Wrecking yard|junkyard]] and leaves him with the owner Ray ([[William Sanderson]]), who assures her that Max will be taken to a ranch in a few days. However, when Lori leaves, Ray [[chain]]s Max to the wall and beats him with a [[shovel]]. When Max pulls loose from his chain, Ray burns his face with a [[blow torch]] but is quickly overpowered and killed. Max, now severely scarred, leaves the junkyard and makes his way back to Lori's house. The police, after discovering the dead mugger and having Dr. Jarret clarify that it was Max who killed him, now intend to stop Max at any cost. By the time Max returns to Lori's, Perry has replaced him with a new puppy named Spike. Max, feeling betrayed, burns Perry's face off with acidic urine and attacks Lori before the police arrive. Max then flees the house and evades the cops and an animal control unit by utilizing his genetic gifts.

As an ambulance takes Perry away, the police demand Lori's help to catch Max and wait for him. Max returns and kills the officers watching the house, which Lori soon discovers. In an attempt to get him back, Jarret kidnaps Lori and Spike in hopes that Max will follow them to the EMAX building, which he does. In the laboratory where she first discovered him, Max relinquishes his aggressive, homicidal nature and begins to kiss Lori's hand. Jarret shoots Max with a [[shotgun]] before being knocked onto a large electrical cage, which kills him. Lori pets Max's head as he dies.

Three months later, Rudy's collie has given birth to puppies, most of which look like their mother, with the one exception being a small black puppy that resembles Max.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22580">In the United States, '''Medicare fraud''' is the claiming of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] health care reimbursement to which the claimant is not entitled. There are many different types of Medicare fraud, all of which have the same goal: to collect money from the Medicare program illegitimately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://constantinecannon.com/whistleblower/medicare-fraud-and-government-healthcare-program-fraud/|title=Medicare Fraud and Fraud in Other Government Healthcare Programs|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total amount of Medicare fraud is difficult to track, because not all fraud is detected and not all suspicious claims turn out to be fraudulent. According to the [[Office of Management and Budget]], Medicare "improper payments" were $47.9 billion in 2010, but some of these payments later turned out to be valid.&lt;ref name="politifact"&gt;[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/04/darrell-issa/rep-darrell-issa-claims-government-could-save-125-/ politifact.com] (2011-01-04). Retrieved on 2011-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimates that total Medicare spending was $528 billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/01-26-outlook.pdf |title=The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2010 to 2020 |publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Medicare fraud ==
Medicare fraud is typically seen in the following ways:{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

# Phantom billing: The medical provider bills Medicare for [[Unnecessary health care|unnecessary procedures]], or procedures that are never performed; for unnecessary medical tests or tests never performed; for unnecessary equipment; or equipment that is billed as new but is, in fact, used.
# Patient billing: A patient who is in on the scam provides his or her Medicare number in exchange for kickbacks. The provider bills Medicare for any reason and the patient is told to admit that he or she indeed received the medical treatment.
# Upcoding scheme and unbundling: Inflating bills by using a billing code that indicates the patient needs expensive procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://constantinecannon.com/whistleblower/healthcare-fraud/upcoding/|title=Upcoding Fraud » Constantine Cannon|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://constantinecannon.com/whistleblower/healthcare-fraud/risk-adjustment/|title=Risk Adjustment Fraud » Constantine Cannon|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 crackdown on fraud charged "111 defendants in nine cities, including doctors, nurses, health care company owners and executives" of fraud schemes involving "various medical treatments and services such as home health care, physical and occupational therapy, nerve conduction tests and durable medical equipment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/02/20110217a.html |title=hhs.gov |publisher=hhs.gov |date=2011-05-07 |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Affordable Care Act]] of 2009'' provides an additional $350 million to pursue physicians who are involved in both intentional/unintentional Medicare fraud through inappropriate billing. Strategies for prevention and apprehension include increased scrutiny of billing patterns, and the use of data analytics. The healthcare reform law also provides for stricter penalties; for instance, requiring physicians to return any overpayments to CMS within 60 days time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicianspractice.com/healthcare-reform/content/article/1462168/2063974 Westgate, Aubrey "Medicare Fraud and Abuse and Your Practice"].

== Law enforcement and prosecution ==
[[File:Jimmy Carter signs Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments into law. - NARA - 176639.tif|thumb|right|220px|[[Jimmy Carter]] signs Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments into law]]

[[Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|The Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], as mandated by Public Law 95-452 (as amended), is to protect the integrity of Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) programs, to include Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the health and welfare of the beneficiaries of those programs. The Office of Investigations for the HHS, OIG collaboratively works with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in order to combat Medicare Fraud.

Defendants convicted of Medicare fraud face stiff penalties according to the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] and disbarment from HHS programs. The sentence depends on the amount of the fraud. Defendants can expect to face substantial prison time, deportation (if not a US citizen), fines, and restitution.

In 1997, the federal government dedicated $100 million to federal law enforcement to combat Medicare fraud. That money pays over 400 FBI agents who investigate Medicare fraud claims. In 2007, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, [[U.S. Attorney's Office]], and the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] created the [[Medicare Fraud Strike Force]] in Miami, Florida.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16045685 Feds Fight Rampant Medicare Fraud in South Florida]. NPR. Retrieved on 2010-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt; This group of anti-fraud agents has been duplicated in other cities where Medicare fraud is widespread. In Miami alone, over two dozen agents from various federal agencies investigate solely Medicare fraud.

The Justice Department has used the False Claims Act to recover more than $7.7 billion from January 2009 to June 2012 in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Jersey Hospital Pays U.s. $8,999,999 to Settle False Claims Act Allegations|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/June/12-civ-789.html|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Columbia/HCA fraud case ==
The [[Columbia/HCA]] fraud case is one of the largest examples of Medicare fraud in U.S. history. Numerous ''New York Times'' stories, beginning in 1996, began scrutinizing Columbia/HCA's business and Medicare billing practices. These culminated in the company being raided by Federal agents searching for documents and eventually the ousting of the corporation's CEO, [[Rick Scott]], by the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://jacksonville.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2006/04/17/story1.html?t=printable |title=Jacksonville Business Journal Friday, April 14, 2006 |publisher=Jacksonville.bizjournals.com |date= April 17, 2006|accessdate=2012-01-02 |first=M.C. |last=Moewe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the crimes uncovered were doctors being offered financial incentives to bring in patients, falsifying diagnostic codes to increase reimbursements from Medicare and other government programs, and billing the government for unnecessary lab tests,&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/02/09/360103/index.htm Bringing HCA Back to Life After years of scandal.] Fortune Magazine Feb 2004&lt;/ref&gt; though Scott personally was never charged with any wrongdoing. HCA wound up pleading guilty to more than a dozen criminal and civil charges and paying fines totaling $1.7 billion. In 1999, Columbia/HCA changed its name back to HCA, Inc.

In 2001, [[Hospital Corporation of America|HCA]] reached a plea agreement with the U.S. government that avoided criminal charges against the company and included $95 million in fines.&lt;ref name="JBJ-17Apr06"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2006/04/17/story1.html |date=April 14, 2006 |title=Ex-Columbia chief helps grow Solantic |work=Jacksonville Business Journal |author=M.C. Moewe}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2002, HCA agreed to pay the U.S. government $631 million, plus interest, and pay $17.5 million to state [[Medicaid]] agencies, in addition to $250 million paid up to that point to resolve outstanding Medicare expense claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=December 18, 2002 |title=HCA to settle more allegations for $631M |author=Julie Appleby |work=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/2002-12-18-hca-settlement-_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, civil lawsuits cost HCA more than $1.7 billion to settle, including more than $500 million paid in 2003 to two [[whistleblower]]s.&lt;ref name="JBJ-17Apr06"/&gt;

==Medicare fraud reporting by whistleblowers==
{{Main|False Claims Act}}
The DOJ Medicare fraud enforcement efforts rely heavily on healthcare professionals coming forward with information about Medicare fraud. Federal law allows individuals reporting Medicare fraud to receive full protection from retaliation from their employer and collect up to 30% of the fines that the government collects as a result of the whistleblower's information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicare Fraud Center - Report Medicare Fraud Here|url=http://medicarefraudcenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to US Department of Justice figures, whistleblower activities contributed to over $13 billion in total civil settlements in over 3,660 cases stemming from Medicare fraud in the 20-year period from 1987 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who can become a Medicare fraud whistleblower?|url=http://medicarefraudcenter.org/medicare-fraud-information/13-who-can-become-a-medicare-fraud-whistleblower.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Omnicare fraud===
In November 2009, Omnicare paid $98 million to the federal government to settle five [[qui tam]] lawsuits brought under the ''[[False Claims Act]]'' and government charges that the company had paid or solicited a variety of [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]|title=Nation's largest nursing home pharmacy and drug manufacturer to pay $112 million to settle false claims act cases|date=November 3, 2009|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2009/November/09-civ-1186.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company admitted no wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hilzenrath, David S.|date=January 16, 2010|title=Justice suit accuses Johnson &amp; Johnson of paying kickbacks|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011503903.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges included allegations that Omnicare solicited and received kickbacks from a pharmaceutical manufacturer [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], in exchange for agreeing to recommend that physicians prescribe Risperdal, a Johnson &amp; Johnson antipsychotic drug, to nursing home patients.

Starting in 2006, healthcare entrepreneur [[Adam B. Resnick]] sued Omnicare, a major supplier of drugs to [[nursing homes]], under the [[False Claims Act]], as well as the parties to the company's illegal kickback schemes. Omnicare allegedly paid kickbacks to nursing home operators in order to secure business, which constitutes Medicare fraud and [[Medicaid fraud]]. Omnicare allegedly had paid $50 million to the owners of the Mariner Health Care Inc. and SavaSeniorCare Administrative Services LLC nursing home chains in exchange for the right to continue providing pharmacy services to the nursing homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=U.S. Department of Justice|title=Complaint of the United States in the District Court of Massachusetts CA No. 06-10149 RGS| date=March 4, 2009|url=http://www.phillipsandcohen.com/CM/NewsSettlements/United%20States%20v%20%20Omnicare%20Mariner%20et%20al%20%20complaint.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Omnicare settled Resnick's False Claims Act suit that had been taken up by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] by paying $19.8 million to the federal government, while Mariner and SavaSeniorCare settled for $14 million.&lt;ref name="Scheme's victims"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ameet|first=Sachdev|title=Scheme's victims Scheme's victims seeking restitution FDIC could get most of payment; FDIC could get most of payment|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-02-11/news/1002100576_1_fdic-restitution-bank-fraud|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=12 September 2013|date=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Settle Whistleblower Kickback Case"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prominent New York City Real Estate Investor, Attorney and Atlanta Nursing Home Chains Pay $14 Million to Settle Whistleblower Kickback Case|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/prominent-new-york-city-real-estate-investor-attorney-and-atlanta-nursing-home-chains-pay-14-million-to-settle-whistleblower-kickback-case-85506647.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Walden Thoreau.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of [[Henry David Thoreau|Henry Thoreau]]'s memoir, ''[[Walden]]'' (1854)]]

A '''memoir''' (US: /ˈmemwɑːr/;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/memoir|title=memoir noun - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes|website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[French language|French]]: ''mémoire'': ''memoria'', meaning ''memory'' or ''reminiscence'') is a collection of memories that an individual writes about moments or events, both public or private, that took place in the subject's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=memoir |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster.com |date=July 5, 2015|publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/memoir}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=memoir |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |date=July 5, 2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/memoir}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assertions made in the work are understood to be factual. While memoir has historically been defined as a subcategory of [[biography]] or [[autobiography]]  since the late 20th century, the genre is differentiated in form, presenting a narrowed focus. A biography or autobiography tells the story "of a life", while a memoir often tells a story "from a life", such as [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]] events and turning points from the author's life. The author of a memoir may be referred to as a ''memoirist'' or a ''memorialist''.

==Early memoirs==
Memoirs have been written since the ancient times, as shown by [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', also known as ''Commentaries on the Gallic Wars''. In the work, Caesar describes the battles that took place during the nine years that he spent fighting local armies in the [[Gallic Wars]]. His second memoir, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' (or ''Commentaries on the Civil War'') is an account of the events that took place between 49 and 48 BC in [[Caesar's civil war|the civil war]] against [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Gnaeus Pompeius]] and the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. The noted [[Libanius]], teacher of rhetoric who lived between an estimated 314 and 394 AD, framed his life memoir as one of his literary [[oration]]s, which were written to be read aloud in the privacy of his study. This kind of memoir refers to the idea in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], that memoirs were like "memos", or pieces of unfinished and unpublished writing, which a writer might use as a memory aid to make a more finished document later on.

The ''[[Sarashina Nikki]]'' is an example of an early Japanese memoir, written in the [[Heian period]]. A genre of diary writing, [[Nikki Bungaku]], emerged during this time.
 
In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]], [[Jean de Joinville]], and [[Philippe de Commines]] wrote memoirs, while the genre was represented toward the end of the [[Renaissance]], through the works of [[Blaise de Lasseran-Massencôme, seigneur de Montluc|Blaise de Montluc]] and [[Margaret of Valois]], that she was the first woman to write her ''Memoirs'' in modern-style.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Viennot, Éliane, ''[http://revue.etudes-episteme.org/IMG/pdf/1Marguerite_de_Valois2.pdf Marguerite de Valois et l'écriture de l'histoire, 1574-1614]'', ''Études Épistémè'', 17, spring 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until the [[Age of Enlightenment]] encompassing the 17th and 18th centuries, works of memoir were written by [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]]; [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|François de La Rochefoucauld]], Prince de Marcillac of France; and [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon]], who wrote ''Memoirs'' at his family's home at the castle of [[La Ferté-Vidame]]. While Saint-Simon was considered a writer possessing a high level of skill for narrative and character development, it wasn't until well after his death that his work as a memoirist was recognized, resulting in literary fame.&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, George (1911). ''[https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri24chisrich#page/47/mode/1up Saint-Simon, Louis de Rouvroy, Duc de]'', In Chisholm, Hugh. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 24 (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press, pp. 47, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==From the eighteenth century==
Over the latter half of the 18th through the mid-20th century, memoirists generally included those who were noted within their chosen profession. These authors wrote as a way to record and publish their own account of their public exploits. Authors included politicians or people in court society and were later joined by military leaders and businessmen. An exception to these models is [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s 1854 memoir ''[[Walden]]'', which presents his experiences over the course of two years in a cabin he built near [[Walden Pond]].

Twentieth-century war memoirs became a genre of their own, including, from the [[First World War]], [[Ernst Jünger]] (''[[Storm of Steel]]'') and [[Frederic Manning]]'s  ''Her Privates We''. Memoirs documenting incarceration by [[Nazi Germany]] during the war include [[Primo Levi]]'s ''[[If This Is a Man]]'', which covers his arrest as a member of the [[Italian Resistance Movement]], followed by his life as a prisoner in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]; and [[Elie Wiesel]]'s ''[[Night (book)|Night]]'', which is based on his life prior to and during his time in the Auschwitz, [[Monowitz Buna Werke|Buna Werke]], and [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] concentration camps.

==Memoirs today==
In the early 1990s, memoirs written by ordinary people experienced a sudden upsurge, as an increasing number of people realized that their [[Ancestor|ancestors’]] and their own stories were about to disappear, in part as a result of the opportunities and distractions of technological advances. At the same time, [[psychology]] and other research began to show that familiarity with [[genealogy]] helps people find their place in the world and that life review helps people come to terms with their own past.

With the advent of inexpensive [[Self-publishing|digital book production]] in the first decade of the 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Henke |first1=Harold |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B1cQ9Zk2M40C&amp;dq |title=Electronic Books and ePublishing: A Practical Guide for Authors |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2001 |isbn=978-1852334352 |accessdate=2014-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Literary genre|genre]] exploded. Memoirs written as a way to pass down a personal legacy, rather than as a literary work of art or historical document, are emerging as a personal and family responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Balzer |first1=Paula |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tv0N4je5uxYC&amp;dq |title=Writing &amp; Selling Your Memoir: How to Craft Your Life Story So That Somebody Else Will Actually Want to Read It |publisher=Writer |year=2011 |isbn=978-1599631356 |accessdate=2014-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association of Personal Historians]] formed in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], in the early days of the modern memoir, as an international trade association for professionals who assist individuals, families, and organizations in documenting their life stories, preferably in archival formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wright |first=Chris |title=Ordinary people |work=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]] |publisher=Phoenix Media/Communications Group |date=2002-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morton Pumpkin Festival is annual four-day festival organized and sponsored by the Morton Chamber of Commerce held in mid-September. The '''Morton Pumpkin Festival''' was first held in [[Morton, Illinois]] in 1967. The event now draws more than 75,000 attendees annually.

In 1978, [[Governor of Illinois|Governor]] [[James R. Thompson]] declared Morton the “Pumpkin Capital of the World.”&lt;ref name="Community Spirit"&gt;[http://www.peoriamagazines.com/as/2007/sep-oct/community-spirit-profile-pumpkin] Community Spirit&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton's title of "Pumpkin Capital of the World" is tied to the presence of Nestle's Libby pumpkin plant, which processes more than 80 percent of the world's canned pumpkin.

==Festival Themes==
Each year, the Morton Chamber of Commerce selects a special theme for the Morton Pumpkin Festival.  Festival themes are voted on by the general public while taking the annual Pumpkin Festival Survey in September.  The top festival theme choices are then taken to the Pumpkin Festival Oversight Committee and the Morton Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors for the final selection.  Themes are announced in January during the Morton Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner.  

Many of the Pumpkin Festival events and activities including the Parades, Pageants, Entertainment, Competitions, and Opening Ceremonies incorporate costumes, music, and other elements in celebration of the annual theme.

==Food==
Many attendees of the festival come just for the food, especially the pumpkin flavored food.  Beyond the usual fair/carnival favorites and pumpkin pie, some of the other items include pumpkin chili, pumpkin cookies, pumpkin doughnuts, pumpkin caramel shake, pumpkin ice cream and pumpkin fudge. 

The marquee food-related event typically happens on the Saturday morning of the Pumpkin Festival. Saturday morning showcases the all-you-can-eat Pumpkin Pancake breakfast.  One price includes all the pumpkin pancakes you can eat, sausage, coffee &amp; milk.  All served under a huge tent with local children providing breakfast-time entertainment.

==Punkin Chuckin'==
The [https://web.archive.org/web/20121018122620/http://mortonmagnet.com/punkin_chuckin.php Punkin Chuckin' Contest] is a tradition that involves giant contraptions that hurl, catapult, or shoot 5-10 pound [[pumpkins]] in the air into an open field. Competitors compete for the title of “Punkin' Chucker Supreme” with a one mile goal. The contest is now well over a decade old and is said to be modeled after the [[Punkin_Chunkin#World Championship Punkin' Chunkin'|contest]] in [[Sussex County, Delaware]] the first weekend after Halloween, but Morton holds the world record for farthest pumpkin thrown.
The contest takes place in an open field over a span of two days. Around 500 pumpkins are picked in advance specifically for the contest which sports both a youth and an adult competition. The youth competition uses pumpkins from 5 to 8 pounds and the adult competition uses pumpkins from 8 to 10 pounds. Before the main throwing begins there is a safety meeting, during which there is also a “hand throwing contest” with a one dollar entry fee. The contest moves from the youth section into the adult, giving each team one throw, then moves back to the beginning and starts again giving each team a total of three contest throws. In between throws there are short breaks in which teams throw for fun and try to aim at old cars placed in the fields for targets. The contest is all about distance and at the end of the second day a winner is declared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mortonmagnet.com/chuckin.php Punkin Chuckin 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105205242/http://www.mortonmagnet.com/chuckin.php |date=2009-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Punkin Chuckin’ Contest has turned out some pretty amazing machines, from trebuchets to air cannons, but one machine holds a spot in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]. The Q-36 Pumpkin Modulator is a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} long air cannon that fired a pumpkin {{convert|4680|ft|m}} for a world record (the record as of November 2010 is held by team Big 10 Inch at 5545.43&amp;nbsp;ft). The Q-36 has an {{convert|80|ft|m|0|adj=on}} barrel and a {{convert|1800|USgal|L|adj=on}} air tank and tips the scale at {{convert|36000|lb|kg}}. A [[pumpkin]] leaving the tube flies at nearly{{Clarify|date=October 2008}} {{convert|681|mph|km/h}} but loses velocity quickly. This cannon has been seen on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]] as well as another famous device, the Acme Catapult, which saw airtime on [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.douglascoulter.com/Personal/body_punkin__chuckin_.html Punkin' Chuckin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acmecatapult.com] Acme Catapult&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Moscow Music Peace Festival''' was a one-time gathering of high-profile [[hard rock]] acts for a performance in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]] on 12 and 13 August [[1989 in music|1989]] to promote world peace and establish international cooperation in fighting the drug war in [[Russia]].  It was part of an era of momentous change in the [[Soviet Union]].

==Production and crew==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
The show involved a large production team and logistics provided by Eurotruk.  Generators powered the entire event as it was broadcast as a pay-per-view event by MTV.  Catering came from the UK.  There were direct-dial telephone lines from the production office, and satellite uplink from Bear Lake back to the USA.

The show production radios were the latest from the USA and some were encrypted. There was 6 Megawatts of power available from the generators.

==Management==
The concert was put together by the [[Make a Difference Foundation]], its founder, rock producer and manager [[Doc McGhee]], [[Stas Namin]] and other major players in the Soviet Union and the [[United States]]. It is often stated that McGhee agreed to bring his artists to Moscow after becoming involved in a drug scandal himself and wishing to avoid a jail sentence, but he explicitly denied that in 2011. "We always wanted to go over to Moscow and do the first rock show in the Soviet Union. I wanted to do their [[Woodstock Music and Art Festival|Woodstock]]." Since it had also been part of that plan that the proceeds would go to Make a Difference and doctors would be brought to the USSR to teach methods of treating addiction (Soviet doctors at the time primarily used [[electroshock therapy]] for that purpose), he did not expect the sentencing judge would have denied him the opportunity.&lt;ref name="I Want My MTV"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=498–501|chapter=43|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mötley Crüe have been on record stating they were upset with McGhee at this point in time. They felt McGhee was favoring Bon Jovi, whom he also managed, and whom Crüe disdained. When Bon Jovi closed the show, they used [[pyrotechnics]], which Mötley Crüe had been told they could not do (McGhee claims it was a malfunction on one side of the stadium that he did not hear because he was backstage). [[Sebastian Bach]] of [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]], whom McGhee also managed, says [[Tommy Lee]] went over to him and said "Your manager's a fucking asshole" and chugged most of a bottle of vodka Bach had been drinking (up to this point, Lee has said, it was the first time the band had done a show sober). Then he ran up to McGhee, punched him in the face and told him he could go manage [[The Chipmunks]] because he was no longer Mötley Crüe's manager. Bon Jovi fired him as well shortly afterwards. Lee and his bandmates were still so angry they refused to fly home on the same plane as McGhee.&lt;ref name="I Want My MTV" /&gt;

==Venue==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
The event was held over two days in [[Moscow]]'s largest stadium, Central Lenin Stadium (now called [[Luzhniki Stadium]]), which has a [[seating capacity]] of about 100,000.  However, as the concert used a proscenium stage rather than an arena stage, a thousands of seats behind the stage were not occupied.  The event was the first rock concert to be held at the stadium, which had previously been used primarily for sporting events.

==Performances==

Each band performed about a 5-song set. At the end of the concert a collaboration of musicians, featuring Vince Neil &amp; Sebastian Bach on vocals and Jason Bonham on drums, performed a rendition of "[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]].

The performances were shown on [[television|TV]] and are recapped in a video directed by [[Wayne Isham]]. Bootlegged copies of the performances have been uploaded to the Internet.

==Album==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Stairway to Heaven-Highway to Hell album cover.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Stairway to Heaven/Highway to Hell]]'']] --&gt;
The bands were all featured on the 1989 compilation album ''[[Stairway to Heaven/Highway to Hell]]'', put out the Make a Difference Foundation.  Each band recorded a song originally by some famous rock artist who had suffered a drug- or alcohol-related death.  These included songs from [[The Who]], the [[Sex Pistols]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Tommy Bolin]], [[Thin Lizzy]], and [[Janis Joplin]], along with a collaboration for [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Moby Dick (instrumental)|Moby Dick]]" (for [[John Bonham]]), and a live collaboration where the bands perform a medley of [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] songs.

==Problems==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
Noted in books such as ''Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal'', the concert also showcased the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] clashes which eventually helped lead to the collapse of [[glam metal]] shortly thereafter.  Many of the bands argued over who went on before whom, and many were envious of [[Bon Jovi]], who not only headlined the event and was far more considered to be pop music among the hard rock and heavy metal community, but also had a much more theatrical stage spectacle and longer set times; each band was supposed to do a stripped-down show with just music and no spectacular theatrics. [[Jon Bon Jovi]] supposedly offered his headlining spot to [[Ozzy Osbourne]] after Ozzy threatened to not go through with his set (a move many felt was calculated to further JBJ's 'boy next door' persona). Ozzy's set was initially scheduled before [[Mötley Crüe]]'s set. Apparently, Ozzy felt his band was bigger and he should go on after Mötley Crüe. To solve the problem, Mötley Crüe went on before Ozzy but the tape was edited so it appeared Ozzy went on before Mötley Crüe to the viewers back in the U.S. Those involved in the show's production felt this was an egotistical bush move on Ozzy's behalf since this was supposed to be for charity, and left many in the rock 'n roll community confused since Ozzy and Mötley Crüe toured together for Ozzy's ''[[Bark at the Moon]]'' and Mötley Crüe's ''[[Shout at the Devil]]'' albums, respectively, and became fast friends during the tour.

The members of Mötley Crüe were so incensed about preferences shown to Bon Jovi that [[Tommy Lee]] punched manager [[Doc McGhee]] (who was also the manager for Bon Jovi) backstage at the venue (McGhee was fired shortly thereafter), opting to fly back to the US on their own.  The concert was also often chided by the bands themselves as being [[hypocritical]], as many of the musicians were drinking or using drugs at the time despite the ties with the [[Make a Difference Foundation]].

The event became known for inspiring the song "[[Wind of Change (Scorpions song)|Wind of Change]]" by the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], a ballad which became a soundtrack to the collapse of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the end of Soviet Union.

'''''Nordic Game Jam''''' is an annual [[game jam]] that takes place in [[Copenhagen]], created in 2006 by Gorm Lai and the Danish chapter of the [[International Game Developers Association]] in collaboration with [[Jesper Juul (game researcher)|Jesper Juul]] (the [[IT University of Copenhagen]]) and Henriette Moos (Diginet Øresund). It is the biggest videogame-related event in Denmark and one of the largest game jams in the world, with 900 participants as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.nordicgamejam.org/2016/04/heres-to-the-winners-of-ngj16/|title=#NGJ16 winners announcement|author=Nordic Game Jam|date=April 17, 2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants are given a theme or series of restrictions at the beginning of the event and are then given around 40 hours to make a game around those. In 2009 it served as the flagship game jam and inspiration for [[Global Game Jam]]. The 2013 edition of Nordic Game Jam was for the first time held at [[Aalborg University – Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Official announcement for the new venue for Nordic Game Jam 2013 [http://www.aau-cph.dk/arrangementer/Arrangement//nordic-game-jam.cid78741]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
Participants in the Nordic Game Jam come from several [[Nordic countries]] as well as other countries around the world. People of all skill levels and from various fields are welcome, such as game designers, programmers, sound designers, graphic artists or simply those interested in learning how to make games.

Before the jam begins, participants are given some time to meet and form teams, encouraging partnering with new people. Afterwards the theme and restrictions for that year are released and the countdown begins.

==Past events==

===2006===
The first Nordic Game Jam was held from January 27–29, 2006, at the IT University of Copenhagen. During the jam, 40 participants created 8 games in 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;''Website for the 2006 edition of Nordic Game Jam [http://nordicgamejam.org/06/]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007===
In February 2007 the number of participants doubled to 80 with a total of 12 games created.&lt;ref&gt;''Website for the 2007 edition of the Nordic Game Jam [http://nordicgamejam.org/07/]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
For 2008 the number of participants increased to the point of becoming the biggest game jam in the world at its time, with 150 participants and 19 games.&lt;ref&gt;''Website for the 2008 edition of the Nordic Game Jam {{cite web |url=http://nordicgamejam.org/08/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116045632/http://nordicgamejam.org/08/ |archivedate=2013-01-16 |df= }}''&lt;/ref&gt; The main theme for 2008 was "Taboo" and three constraints: the game had to loop, had to be playable with a controller and was required to be multiplayer.

===2009===
In 2009 Nordic Game Jam became the flagship for the [[Global Game Jam]], which started that same year during the same time. Chairman of the IGDA Education Special Interest Group Susan Gold organized an initiative with Ian Schreiber and Gorm Lai to have game jams around the globe in the same way as the Nordic Game Jam and with Nordic Game Jam as flaghsip, inspiration and model. A total of 157 participants took part in the jam and made around 29 games.&lt;ref&gt;''Main page for the 2009 edition of the Nordic Game Jam.[http://nordicgamejam.org/09/NGJ09.html]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010===
For 2010 Nordic Game Jam brought the at the time [[Microsoft Game Studios]] Creative Director [[Peter Molyneux]] as keynote speaker and member of the jury.&lt;ref&gt;''Main page for the 2010 edition of the Nordic Game Jam.[http://nordicgamejam.org/10/]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011===
In 2011 [[Greg Costikyan]] was the keynote speaker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nordicgamejam.org/2011/01/05/world-renowned-game-designer-greg-costikyan-comes-to-denmark/ ''World-renowned Game Designer Greg Costikyan comes to Denmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012===
For 2012 Senior Designer at [[BioWare]] Manveer Heir gave that year's keynote speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nordicgamejam.org/2011/12/29/pre-interview-with-keynote-speaker-manveer-heir/ ''Pre-Interview with Keynote Speaker Manveer Heir]&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 350 participants attended that year.

===2013===
The 2013 edition of Nordic Game Jam however brought several changes. Besides taking place in a new venue (Aalborg University in Copenhagen) it was also moved one week ahead of the Global Game Jam, separating itself from the global competition to allow participants to go to both Nordic Game Jam and a Global Game Jam event elsewhere the week after. The keynote speakers were Dennaton and [[Vlambeer]]. The event attracted a total of 470 participants.

===2014===
In 2014, Nordic Game Jam took place at [[Aalborg University - Copenhagen]] again and had John Polson as the keynote speaker. The event had a total of 570 participants, and 110 games were created around the theme of [[privacy]].

===2015===
In 2015, the Nordic Game Jam hosted Steve Swink as the Keynote Speaker. The jam grew to more than 700 people, and centered around the theme: Obvious. The winning game was called "The Wuuuuuuu" - as it was controlled only by shouting into a microphone, all the jammers played it together during the final presentations.

===2016===
The 2016 edition hosted over 900 participants and created 182 games. The Keynote speech was held by Kevin Martens &amp; Jesse MacCree from Blizzard, the theme was "Leak" (and was therefore it was revealed before the jam), and the winning game was "Random Access Murder". The jam again took place at the Aalborg University Copenhagen, but the Award Ceremony was moved to Imperial Cinema.

===2017===
In 2017 the jam changed the location - it took place at [[Docken]], Copenhagen. On 21-23 April 2017, 700 participants created games under a theme 'Not there'. The winner of the jam was "Baba is you" by Hempuli.

===2018===
In 2018 the jam changed location again - it took place at TAP1, Copenhagen. On 13-16 April 2018, 700 participants created games under the theme 'Breaking Point'. The winner of the jam was "ON-LINE" by Peter Witt, Ronnie Vilhelmsen, Przemysław Krowiński, Jesper Helleskov Sørensen and Jens Peter Larsen.

'''Operation Eastern Exit''' was the codename given to the military evacuation of the [[Embassy of the United States, Mogadishu|United States embassy]] in [[Mogadishu]], the capital of [[Somalia]], in January 1991. In late December 1990, violence quickly enveloped the city as armed militants began clashing with government soldiers. On 1 January 1991, the [[United States Ambassador to Somalia|US Ambassador to Somalia]], [[James Keough Bishop]], contacted the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] requesting an evacuation of the embassy, which was approved the following day. [[United States Central Command]] began planning and mobilizing forces that evening. The initial plan was to evacuate with a military transport plane through the [[Aden Adde International Airport|Mogadishu International Airport]], but this was later abandoned. A helicopter evacuation via the {{USS|Guam|LPH-9|6}} and {{USS|Trenton|LPD-14|6}} was the remaining option.

On the morning of 5 January, a 60-person [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] and [[Navy SEAL]] security detail was dispatched from ''Guam'' aboard two [[Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion|CH-53E ''Super Stallion'']] helicopters to secure the embassy and prepare for the main evacuation. The two helicopters returned to ''Guam'' with the first 61 evacuees. Throughout the day, foreign [[diplomat]]s and civilians sought refuge at the embassy. Four waves of five [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|CH-46 ''Sea Knight'']] helicopters each evacuated the embassy compound shortly after midnight on 6 January. The evacuees were transported to [[Muscat, Oman]], where they disembarked on 11 January. In total, 281 diplomats and civilians from 30 countries were evacuated, including 12 heads of [[Diplomatic mission|missions]] (eight [[ambassador]]s and four [[Chargé d'Affaires|chargés d'affaires]]).

{{further|Embassy of the United States, Mogadishu#History}}
In the late 1980s, there was [[Somali Civil War#Fall of Barre regime (1986–1991)|increasing rebellion]] against the rule of [[List of Presidents of Somalia|Somali President]] [[Siad Barre]], a [[military dictator]]&lt;ref name="Independent: Barre obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkley Center"/&gt; who maintained tight control of power and had a record of human rights abuses.&lt;ref name="Independent: Barre obituary"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenfield|first1=Robert|title=Obituary: Mohamed Said&lt;!-- sic --&gt; Barre|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-mohamed-said-barre-1566452.html|accessdate=25 March 2015|work=The Independent|date=3 January 1995|quote=It was the end of his 22-year rule in Somalia, which had..degenerated into dictatorship...The complex security paraphernalia and the paramilitary organisations so typical of all repressive states...were installed...Once so identified, whole areas were devastated.

In July 1989, [[Embassy of the United States, Mogadishu|the embassy]] moved to a new, {{convert|80|acre|adj=on}} compound, {{convert|6|mi}} from the previous embassy and James K. Bishop was appointed as the [[United States Ambassador to Somalia|United States' ambassador to Somalia]].&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|46}}&lt;ref name="NYT: Embassy evacuation"/&gt; Ambassador Bishop had significant experience in crisis management at US embassies.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="USDiplomacy: Bishop transcript" /&gt; --&gt; In 1967, he was at the US Embassy in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] when the [[Six-Day War]] erupted.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="USDiplomacy: Bishop transcript" /&gt; --&gt; About 3,600 Americans were evacuated in 33 hours; Bishop was one of 26 diplomats and soldiers that remained in the city.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="USDiplomacy: Bishop transcript" /&gt; --&gt; As deputy assistant secretary of state for Africa from 1981–87, Bishop chaired several task forces for crises and gained experience in the State Department's operations center as evacuations were carried out during several [[coups d'etat]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="USDiplomacy: Bishop transcript" /&gt; --&gt; During his previous assignment as Ambassador to [[Liberia]] (1987–90), Bishop was overseeing the voluntary evacuation of embassy staff and civilians as [[First Liberian Civil War|a civil war]] in Liberia spread, when he left in March 1990.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="USDiplomacy: Bishop transcript" /&gt; --&gt; Soon after returning to Washington to prepare for his new appointment to [[Somalia]], he was appointed to a taskforce to deal with the crisis in Liberia, which included a gradual evacuation of American civilians and a rapid closure of the embassy in August.&lt;ref name="USDiplomacy: Bishop transcript" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|75–78}}

On 1 August, before leaving the US to take up his post in [[Mogadishu]], Ambassador Bishop visited [[United States Central Command]]—the military command for the [[Middle East]] and [[northeast Africa]]{{efn|Today, Somalia is part of the US military's [[United States Africa Command]] (established in 2008) area of responsibility.}}—where he spent most of the day with its commander, Gen.&amp;nbsp;[[Norman Schwarzkopf]].&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|84–85}} Ambassador Bishop, aware of the ongoing strife, believed "the odds were better than even that we would have to leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances."&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|85}} Ambassador Bishop understood from his past experiences in Beirut and Liberia the importance of being prepared to deal with emergencies and spent the afternoon working with military experts to review the embassy's Emergencies and Evacuation (E&amp;E) plan until he was "satisfied...that [Central Command] realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from Mogadishu and was prepared to do that."&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|85}} In its analysis of Operation Eastern Exit, the [[Center for Naval Analyses]] cited the Ambassador Bishop's previous experience and "clear understanding of his role"&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit"/&gt;{{Rp|v}} in the operation as one of the reasons Operation Eastern Exit went so well.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit"/&gt;{{Rp|v}}

Hours after Ambassador Bishop's visit to Central Command, [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraq invaded Kuwait]].&lt;ref name="History: Iraq invades Kuwait"/&gt;&lt;!-- The invasion began at 2:00AM local time, which was 23:00UTC 1 August and about 19:00/7:00PM in the eastern US. Ambassador Bishop spent most of the afternoon of 1 August at Central Command. --&gt; In 1979, the US negotiated access to an airport and port in both Mogadishu and [[Berbera]]; because of limited access the US had to locations in the Persian Gulf area, maintaining this access was a main interest for the Mogadishu embassy to pursue as the US mobilized to intervene in Kuwait.&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|84–85, 89–90}}

An increasing level of criminal violence prompted Ambassador Bishop to request the voluntary evacuation of dependents (e.g. children and spouses of staff) and non-essential staff in early December, although fighting between the government and the [[United Somali Congress]] (a rebel militia) remained no less than about {{convert|100|mi|order=flip|sigfig=2}} away.&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|93}} The voluntary evacuation later became a mandatory evacuation. By 19 December, the number of official US personnel in the city was reduced from 147 to 37;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit"/&gt;{{Rp|2}} around the same time, fighting between the government and rebels came within about {{convert|40|mi|order=flip}} of Mogadishu.&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|93}}

[[File:Siabar 003.jpg|thumb|right|President of Somalia, Major General [[Siad Barre]]]]
On 30 December, violence escalated "an order of magnitude"&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu"/&gt; as militants entered Mogadishu, which was quickly enveloped by a general state of lawlessness.&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu"/&gt; On 30–31 December, diplomats, including many stationed in offices elsewhere in the city, were collected and housed in the embassy compound, except two volunteers who remained in the embassy's ''K-7'' residential apartments located across Afgoy Road from the embassy.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|8}} The volunteers in the K-7 building would be needed as look-outs for the embassy compound's main gate.&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu"/&gt;{{efn|Until the K-7 compound was evacuated on 4 January, the embassy's main gate would only be opened to receive evacuees and send and receive armored vehicles (dispatched to fetch persons elsewhere in the city) when the lookouts radioed that no armed persons were on Afghoy Road.&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu"/&gt;}} On the morning of 31 December, the defense attaché was nearly killed when his vehicle was sprayed with bullets and that evening, a soldier at a roadblock shot the tires of a vehicle carrying another defense official.&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu"/&gt; Attempts by the US and other nations' diplomats, in particular the Italian embassy, to negotiate a ceasefire for foreigners to leave were unsuccessful. Afgoy Road became a "shooting gallery,"&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu"/&gt; preventing those in safe-havens outside the embassy from reaching it. On New Year's Day, the first American civilians began to seek refuge at the embassy.&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu"/&gt;

Ambassador Bishop requested an evacuation of the American community on 1 January, indicating that the evacuation could be with the planned Italian, French, or German evacuation efforts, but preferred an evacuation by the US military.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|8–9}} The State Department authorized the evacuation on 2 January and on that day, Ambassador Bishop specifically requested an evacuation by the US military, thereby initiating Operation Eastern Exit.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|9}}&lt;ref name="ADST: Evacuating Somalia"/&gt; Ambassador Bishop had spent a considerable amount of time discussing contingency plans for evacuation with other diplomatic posts.&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|90}} Ultimately, ten heads of missions—eight ambassadors and two [[Chargé d'Affaires|chargés d'affaires]]—along with their staff sought refuge in the US embassy compound and were evacuated.&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|94–95}}

==Plans, mobilization, and escalating violence==
Ambassador Bishop had visited Central Command in August 1990, where he worked with military experts to update the embassy's E&amp;E plan.&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|84–85}} The first notice that an evacuation of the Mogadishu embassy would be needed came on the morning of 1 January, when the top naval commander at Central Command sent a message to his naval operations staff: "Better have Amphib crowd take a look at a helo NEO of Mogadishu! time/distance to get there from Masirah OP area."&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|8}} Following the ambassador's 2 January evacuation request, the commander of Central Command ordered Air Force aircraft to the region, the movement of amphibious ships to Mogadishu, and requested [[United States Special Operations Command]] to prepare for a noncombatant evacuation operation.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|2}}

The initial plan was to evacuate via Mogadishu International Airport.&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity: Operation Eastern Exit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop"/&gt;{{Rp|94}} Soon after the evacuation request, the [[United States Air Force]] deployed [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]] transport planes and an [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130]], for gunfire support, to [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], awaiting clearances to enter Somalia and the ability to safely transfer evacuees from the embassy to the airport.&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|11}}&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop"/&gt;{{Rp|94}} However, the US and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain clearances.&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu"/&gt; It also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command-and-control structure, making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage.&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu"/&gt; Likewise, government troops faced a command-and-control problem; reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines, in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with.&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu" /&gt; Thus, it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible.&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity: Operation Eastern Exit"/&gt; Several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach Mogadishu, but faced the same problems of landing and transit of evacuees to the airport.&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop"/&gt;{{Rp|96}}

On 4 January, several incidents, including a couple exchanges of gunfire, suggested that the embassy's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed Somalis until the USS ''Guam'' and USS ''Trenton'' arrived with their helicopters and soldiers, at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 January.&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop"/&gt;{{Rp|94–97}} The embassy had just six Marine guards, whose job was limited to protecting the [[chancery (diplomacy)|chancery]].&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop"/&gt;{{Rp|95}} Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived.&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop"/&gt;{{Rp|95}} The request was denied, but the Ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning.&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop"/&gt;{{Rp|95}}

[[File:USS Guam (LPH-9) underway c1965.jpg|thumb|USS ''Guam'']]
USS ''Guam'' and USS ''Trenton'' began transit from the coast of Oman towards Mogadishu at 22:30 (23:30 Oman time){{efn|name=timezone}} on 2 January.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|13}} The commander of Amphibious Group Two had initially proposed a seven-ship Amphibious Task Group, composed of vessels anchored at [[Masirah Island]] (off Oman) and [[Dubai]] and including four amphibious ships so that the full range of amphibious capabilities would be available for the operation.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|12}} However, intervention in Kuwait seemed imminent{{efn|The US and allied countries would intervene in Kuwait two weeks later, on 17 January.}} and the commander of naval forces at Central Command did not want to divert that many ships from the Persian Gulf, thus the decision to send two of the closest ships.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|12–13}} Although the two vessels were selected by mid-afternoon on 2 January, the transfer of some personnel from Dubai to Masirah caused a delay of eight to ten hours.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|14}} ''Guam'' and ''Trenton'' carried forces from the 4th [[Marine Expeditionary Brigade]], including a detachment of CH-53E ''Super Stallion'' helicopters—the largest helicopters operated by the US military—and two squadrons of CH-46 ''Sea Knight'' helicopters.&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity: Operation Eastern Exit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|2}}

[[File:USS Trenton LPD-14 fleetweek2004.jpg|thumb|left|USS ''Trenton'']]
Planning began in earnest as the ships got underway, with a combined command center on ''Guam''.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|16}} --&gt; On the morning of 3 January, the task force's command questioned why they were not given the option of an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious landing]] and requested a [[Landing Ship, Tank|tank landing ship]] be added to the task force; the request was denied.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|16}} --&gt; A warrant officer who had previously served as a Marine Security Guard at the Mogadishu embassy during the mid-1980s was found.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|16}} --&gt; Despite Ambassador Bishop's planning with Central Command, the task force was provided outdated information.

==Evacuation==

The walled [[chancery (diplomacy)|chancery]] (foreground) is most prominent, but it was further located within the walled embassy compound (note wall in upper left, top). The administrative office building (top right) and Marine House (top, right of center) are visible. The helicopter landing zone was between the chancery and Marine House, above the roundabout.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|6}}]]
On the evening of 4 January, the final execute order was issued for a 02:45{{efn|name=timezone}} launch of two CH-53E Super Stallions to arrive at the embassy at dawn.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|19}} --&gt; The 60 soldiers selected for the security detail were issued weapons and ammunition. Two Marine Corps [[KC-130]] refueling tankers were mobilized closer to the operation, from [[Bahrain]] to Oman, to refuel the helicopters en route to Mogadishu&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|19}} --&gt; and the two helicopters transferred from ''Trenton'' to ''Guam''.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|19, 22}}

===Security detail and first evacuees===
Two CH-53E Super Stallions carrying a 60-man security detail—51 Marines and nine Navy SEALs—departed ''Guam'' at 02:47, {{convert|466|nmi}} from the embassy, and were expected to arrive at 06:20.&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity: Operation Eastern Exit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|3}} They performed two aerial refuelings.&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity: Operation Eastern Exit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|23}} During the first refueling, a pipe burst on one of the helicopters, dousing soldiers in fuel and nearly forcing a return to the ''Guam''; problems with the helicopters' navigation system also complicated the refueling rendezvous.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|23}} The helicopters arrived in Mogadishu at dawn, crossing the coast just south of the harbor at {{convert|25|-|50|ft}} in altitude on a route that was planned to avoid areas of more intense violence reported in the northern parts of the city.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|3, 23–24}} On their arrival in Mogadishu, the crew of the helicopters were using an outdated 1969 map, which showed the embassy in an isolated area.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|24}} Furthermore, they had been told the embassy could be discerned by its white stucco perimeter wall and golf course.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|23–24}} The embassy was, in fact, surrounded by new development and the crew saw white stucco walls around many buildings in the city.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|24}} The helicopters were flying too low to spot a strobe light which was placed on the embassy's water tower (the highest point within the embassy compound) and the golf course in the embassy compound had a black, oil-coated surface—not the familiar green grass that the helicopter crew would recognize.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|24, 26}}&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|98}}After breaking radio silence (their only direct communication with the embassy was unencrypted) to contact the embassy, they were able to discern it and land at 07:10.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|24}} As they arrived, a group of about 100 to 150 Somalis were attempting to enter the embassy compound via ladders on the wall, but scattered as the helicopters arrived.&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity: Operation Eastern Exit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|3, 23–26}}

The security detail moved to establish a perimeter around the embassy compound and the Air Force's AC-130 arrived to provide overhead support.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|24}} Ambassador Bishop gave the security detail clear instructions on the [[rules of engagement]]: they could only use deadly force if people came over the embassy compound's walls with obvious hostile intent.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|28}} He also identified three zones of defense, stating a preference to retreat to the third zone before the use of deadly force:&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|28}}
*the entire embassy compound
*the Chancery, Joint Administrative Office (JAO) building, Marine House, and the helicopter landing zone (HLZ)
*the chancery and JAO buildings (the two "safehaven" buildings where the evacuees were held)
Ambassador Bishop clearly explained his rationale to the security detail, which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|28}} He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got the impression that the US was intervening in the conflict.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|28}} To this effect, he requested the [[Voice of America]] and [[BBC]] broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|28}} The Marines who had been doused in fuel during the refueling were able to take a shower and wash their clothes.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|30}}

After an hour on the ground, the helicopters left with the first 61 evacuees, including all American civilians&lt;!-- "all non-official Americans" in CNA analysis --&gt; and four heads of mission&lt;!-- Nigerian, Turkish, &amp; UAE ambassadors and Omani chargé --&gt;.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|24}} Evacuees were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|24}} Complications with the only in-flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling, which would have forced the helicopters to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|25}} At 9:40, the helicopters arrived on ''Guam'' and unloaded the evacuees.&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity: Operation Eastern Exit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|25}}

===Embassy during the day===
No threats came upon the embassy during the day, although truckloads of armed Somalis frequently drove by the embassy along Afghoy Road.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|29}} --&gt; Only one incident seemed to directly target the embassy.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|31}} --&gt; A sniper and a spotter were positioned on the embassy's water tower (the highest structure in the compound) and came under fire; they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position on the water tower.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|29, 31}}

The Office of Military Cooperation, just one and a half blocks from the embassy, required evacuation.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|29}}&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|99}} --&gt; Despite its proximity to the embassy, an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|29}} --&gt; A convoy of vehicles with several Marines and SEALs left the embassy at 8:47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from the OMC (four Americans, a Filipino, and 17 Kenyans).&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|29}} --&gt; This was the only excursion outside the embassy by the security detail.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|29}}&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|99–100}} --&gt; Throughout the day, foreign diplomats contacted the embassy desiring to be evacuated; the US welcomed these requests, but required all of them to find their own transportation to the embassy.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|29}}&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|99–100}}

A Somali officer who had a previous relationship with the embassy, Major Siad, agreed to travel to rescue the German chargé d'affaires and British ambassador (junior staff from the British embassy had previously come to the US embassy).&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|100}}&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|29}} The Soviet Union was unable to land a plane in Mogadishu the previous day&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|10}} and the Soviet ambassador asked Ambassador Bishop if he and his staff could be rescued; Ambassador Bishop, a tennis partner of his Soviet counterpart, agreed but only if they found their own way to the embassy.&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|100}}&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|29}}  Seeing the helicopters on the morning of 5 January, they realized the Americans would not remain in the city much longer. At the request of Ambassador Bishop, Major Siad agreed to transport the Soviets, but only if he was paid enough; the US embassy paid Major Siad, who returned with the Soviet ambassador and 38 of his staff.&lt;ref name="ADST: Evacuating Somalia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|29}} The brother of President Barre, who was also a Major General and Chief of Police, showed up at the embassy in the afternoon with 25 members of his family requesting to be evacuated, but was turned away after a vocal conversation with the ambassador.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|30}}

The operation did not include soldiers to handle the evacuation control center (ECC), which was set up in the JAO&lt;!-- the CNA analysis does not explicitly state the ECC was set up in the JAO, but states that evacuees were processed in the JAO and the ECC is the part of an evacuation operation that handles evacuees --&gt;.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|30–32}} --&gt; A 44-person force consisting primarily of soldiers to handle the ECC was planned for insertion with the CH-53E ''Super Stallions'' after they had returned to the ''Guam''.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|30}} --&gt; However, this was cancelled over objections from the commander of the security detail.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|30}} --&gt; The deficit was partially handled by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from the security detail.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|30}} --&gt; The evacuees were grouped into 15-person "sticks" to be loaded onto the helicopters and were limited to one piece of luggage apiece.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|30–31}} --&gt; Some attempted to bring more, resulting in problems coordinating their evacuation.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|31}} --&gt; Furthermore, many evacuees had pets they wanted to bring, which were not allowed.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|31}} --&gt; Most pets were killed by their owners; some were given poison.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|31}} --&gt; Meanwhile, the soldiers were allowed to consume anything they wanted from the embassy's commissary, such as candy, sodas, and souvenirs (most had been stationed on ships for several months).&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|30}} --&gt; They were also allowed use or take anything they needed from the embassy; the medic filled several bags with medical supplies to return to the ship.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|30–32}}

As evening approached, work began to prepare the HLZ for the main evacuation.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|32}} --&gt; The area was used as a parking lot and several vehicles were left without keys by staff that had already been evacuated. Some cars had to be broken into to be moved.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|32}} --&gt; [[Glow stick|Chemical lights]] were placed in the HLZ in a NATO "Y" pattern.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|32}} --&gt; The entire mission would be conducted with [[Night vision device|night vision goggles]], which required all lights in the embassy compound to be turned off.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|31–32}}

===Main evacuation===
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 040707-N-6208N-104.jpg|thumb|Two CH-46 ''Sea Knight'' helicopters departing [[USS Kearsarge (LHD 3)|USS ''Kearsarge'']], a ship similar to ''Guam'']]
The main evacuation occurred in the early morning hours of 6 January and consisted of four waves of five CH-46 helicopters.&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity: Operation Eastern Exit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|33}} The timing of this phase was determined by range of the CH-46 ''Sea Knight'', which lack aerial refueling capability; the ships were about {{convert|350|-|380|nmi|abbr=on}} away during this phase.&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt; An AC-130 was sent from Saudi Arabia to provide gunfire support during the evacuation and two [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1 ''Iroquois'']] helicopters were on standby to provide gunfire support, but were not deployed.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|33–35}}

The first wave departed ''Guam'' at 23:43.&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|33}} As the second wave landed, Major Siad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by two truckloads of soldiers and held a grenade in one hand and a radio in the other.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="USDiplomacy: Bishop transcript"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|33}}&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|100–101}} --&gt; His request to speak with the ambassador was granted. Major Siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the Somali government had not granted the US permission to carry out such a military operation.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="USDiplomacy: Bishop transcript"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|33}}&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|100–101}} --&gt; He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="USDiplomacy: Bishop transcript"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|33}}&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|100–101}} --&gt; The second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the Major, who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to the ambassador's armored car.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="USDiplomacy: Bishop transcript"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|33}}&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|100–101}} --&gt; Ambassador Bishop remained engaged in conversation with the Major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the Major from reneging on the deal.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="USDiplomacy: Bishop transcript"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|33}}&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|100–101}} --&gt; The final wave departed the embassy at 1:49 and landed on ''Guam'' at 2:23; twenty minutes later, Ambassador Bishop declared the evacuation complete.&lt;ref name="USDiplomacy: Bishop transcript"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|33–34}}&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|100–101}}

===Aftermath at the embassy===
Armed looters were observed entering the embassy compound as the final wave departed.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|34}} --&gt; The doors of the chancery—the main building of the embassy—were reportedly blown open by RPGs within two hours of the embassy's evacuation.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|34}} --&gt; Somali employees of the embassy—known as foreign service nationals (FSNs)—could not be evacuated. Ambassador Bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees airlifted to safer parts of Somalia. Many of the FSNs had sought refuge in the embassy with their families and about 30 were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal. Local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the FSNs. The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys to the commissary and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed.&lt;ref name="USDiplomacy: Bishop transcript"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|101–102}}&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|34}}

===Return to Oman===
[[File:Ambassadors letter of thanks for Operation Eastern Exit.jpg|thumb|upright|Letter thanking the crew of the USS ''Guam'' for the evacuation, signed by the heads of missions that were evacuated]]
A total of 281 evacuees were taken from the embassy, including 12 heads of missions (eight [[ambassador]]s and four [[chargé d'affaires|chargés d'affaires]]) and 61 Americans (including Ambassador Bishop and 36 embassy staff).&lt;ref name="State Dept: History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt; The heads of mission were the ambassadors of the United States, [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Sudan]], [[Turkey]], [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[United Kingdom]] and the chargés of the embassies of [[Germany]], [[Kuwait]], Oman, and [[Qatar]].&lt;ref name="ADST: Evacuating Somalia"/&gt;

Rather than disembark in nearby Mombasa, as originally thought by the evacuees, the ships were ordered back to Oman—a five-day journey. The sailors and marines made way for the evacuees to share living quarters. When the chaplain of ''Guam'' asked crew to sign up as guides for the evacuees while aboard the vessel, two hundred signed up within an hour, and some of the sailors even dressed up as clowns to ease the ordeal for children.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu" /&gt; &lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|102}} --&gt; At the request of the ambassadors, a formal session with the ships' senior officers was held to express their thanks.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|102}} --&gt; On 11 January, the evacuees were offloaded at Muscat, Oman.&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity: Operation Eastern Exit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FSJ: Escape from Mogadishu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|102}}&lt;ref name="CNA: Operation Eastern Exit" /&gt;{{Rp|2}} That afternoon, the American evacuees were flown to Frankfurt, Germany, from where they continued home.&lt;ref name="ADST: Ambassador Bishop" /&gt;{{Rp|102}}

The event is promoted by [[MCD Productions|MCD]] and is sponsored by [[Heineken]]. Oxegen was originally a three-day festival, but from 2008 onwards, it was expanded to four days.

It took place at the [[Punchestown Racecourse]] in [[County Kildare]], [[Ireland]] and has an average attendance of around 60,000 a day, with around 50,000 of these camping on site for the duration, and the rest travelling to the site each day. It takes place on the same weekend as [[T in the Park]] in Scotland and shares a very similar lineup each year, but Oxegen is generally regarded as Ireland's version of the [[Glastonbury Festival]], with the [[Oxegen 2008|2008 festival]] sharing three of the same headliners as its [[England|English]] counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2008/jul/06/goodbye-glasto-hello-oxegen/ |title=Goodbye Glasto...

Oxegen, for two consecutive years, was named as the Best European Festival in a poll which included festivals from France, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom and other countries, leading ''[[The Sunday Business Post]]''{{'}}s Nicola Cooke to describe it as "one of the most successful music festivals in Ireland has{{sic}}".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nicola|last=Cooke|url=http://www.sbpost.ie/newsfeatures/rock-festivals-are-set-to-beat-the-economic-blues-49988.html|title=Rock festivals are set to beat the economic blues|date=20 June 2010|accessdate=20 June 2010|work=[[The Sunday Business Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leagues O'Toole has described it as an "enormously successful, award-winning, established brand [...] aimed at a young audience out for a good time, a post-[[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Cert]] rite of passage perfect for acts with big singalong tunes that sound great in the mud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Leagues|last=O'Toole|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2010/0625/1224273240780.html|title=Living on the edge|date=25 June 2010|work=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=25 June 2010|quote=The two big events that bookend the Irish summer are Oxegen and Electric Picnic, both now enormously successful, award-winning, established brands.

In April 2014, organisers announced that the Oxegen festival would not be going ahead that year, citing a lack of suitable headline acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.oxegen.ie/8175/news/oxegen-2014/ |title=Oxegen 2014 |publisher=Oxegen.ie |date= |accessdate=2014-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626132831/http://www.oxegen.ie/8175/news/oxegen-2014/ |archivedate=26 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Oxegen first took place in 2004 over the second weekend in July. [[The Killers]], who went on to headline the festival twice in 2007 and 2009, were one of the bands to appear at the first Oxegen. [[Dave Keuning]], in an interview with ''[[Hot Press]]'' prior to the 2009 festival, described Oxegen as "a big deal because it's one of the first European festivals we played {{Sic}} when we came over from [[Las Vegas Valley|Vegas]] in 2004. We only had one hit—"[[Mr. Brightside]]"—and were worried in case no one showed. But the tent was packed with people screaming out the words to songs we didn't think they knew. It was that night we thought, 'Hey, something's happening here!' Oxegen more so than Glastonbury even was the highlight of our summer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The original festival, [[Witnness]], sponsored by [[Guinness]], took place during the start of August with notable headliners, including [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[The Foo Fighters]] and [[Green Day]]. In its second and third year, running changed its dates to the second weekend of July. In 2008 Oxegen became a three-day festival.&lt;ref name="Rage Against The Machine to headline Oxegen festival"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/oxegenfestival/34594 |title=Rage Against The Machine to headline Oxegen festival |date=22 February 2008 |accessdate=2009-06-12 |work=NME |location=UK |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606045152/http://www.nme.com/news/oxegenfestival/34594 |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Oxegen has been defined by the attention focused on its own weather, with ''[[The Belfast Telegraph]]'' referring to 2005 as "the sunny one", 2006 as "the torrentially rainy one", 2007 as "the muddy one" and 2008 as "the so-so one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/rain-fails-to-dampen-oxegen-vibes-14402127.html|title=Rain fails to dampen Oxegen vibes|date=13 July 2009|accessdate=14 July 2009|work=The Belfast Telegraph|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
As well as the current eight stages of music, there are three large areas for camping which are subdivided by number and the colours blue, red and green – which is the VIP campsite. The backstage and media areas are located in the middle of the site in the buildings normally used to watch the races. Stalls and shops are also provided for festival-goers, as well as toilet and shower areas for campers from 2006 onwards.

A [[Centra]] store was located in each campsite from 2007 onwards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxegen.ie/2008/node/305 "SHOP TILL YOU DROP!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080716063008/http://www.oxegen.ie/2008/node/305 |date=16 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[An Post]] first appeared at the festival in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://phantom.ie/entertainment/from-the-newsdesk/1653-postcards-from-the-edgeof-oxegen.html |title=Postcards from the edge...of Oxegen |date=3 July 2008 |accessdate=6 July 2008 |work=Phantom FM |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721125949/http://phantom.ie/entertainment/from-the-newsdesk/1653-postcards-from-the-edgeof-oxegen.html |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 Festival==
[[File:Main stage at Oxegen 2006.jpg|right|thumb|The Main Stage on the Saturday of Oxegen 2006]]
{{For|main article|Oxegen 2006}}
'''Oxegen 2006''' took place at [[Punchestown Racecourse]] from 8 to 9 July. A limited number of tickets for the festival went on sale a week after the 2005 festival on Friday 15 July. On 20 February the festival was launched and the first acts were officially announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2006/0220/oxegen.html|title=The Who, Chili Peppers to headline OXEGEN 06|date=20 February 2006|accessdate=8 January 2008|work=RTÉ Arts|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tickets went on general sale on Friday 3 March at 8&amp;nbsp;am, with weekend camping tickets priced at €160. This allocation of tickets sold out within 48 minutes. The festival itself encountered bad weather which eclipsed previous records. There were improvements on the Sunday afternoon with sunny skies and a cool, gentle breeze ensuring a decrease in wet festival-goers.

[[The Who]] and [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] headlined the festival, the former performing live in Ireland for the first time in 35 years, the latter for the fourth time in five summers. [[James Brown]] made his last ever live performance at an Irish festival and [[Arctic Monkeys]] their first festival appearance in Ireland. Also appearing were [[The Strokes]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], [[Richard Ashcroft]], [[Primal Scream]], [[Editors (band)|Editors]], [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]], [[The Kooks]], [[Kasabian]], [[Sigur Rós]], [[The Feeling]], [[The Futureheads]], [[The Go! Team]], [[The Automatic]], [[Paolo Nutini]] and [[Lily Allen]]. Irish acts to appear included [[Bell X1 (band)|Bell X1]], [[Damien Dempsey]], [[Republic of Loose]], [[Director (band)|Director]], The Marshals, [[Sharon Shannon]], [[The Blizzards]], [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]], [[Gemma Hayes]] and [[Humanzi (band)|Humanzi]].

Security arrangements were criticised as being poor by some sections of the media. The camp-site was not free from trouble, with reports of tent-burning and an alleged stabbing on the Sunday night/Monday morning of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Green Room a considerable leak allowed rain into the enclosed marquee. There were 225 arrests for drugs (with 13 charged for possession with intent to supply), one alleged rape,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/now-rapeclaim-revelation-rocks-oxegen-organisers-82644.html|title=Now rape-claim revelation rocks Oxegen organisers|date=11 August 2006|accessdate=16 December 2007|first=Edel|last=Kennedy|work=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Evening Herald]]'' reported that around 250 people were treated for alcohol and drug abuse. When 40 people were sent to [[Naas]] General Hospital, fears were raised of a bad batch of [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]], but no evidence of such a batch was found. A number of media outlets were threatened with legal action on their coverage of Oxegen 2006 in its aftermath. These included the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' and [[boards.ie]], where all discussion of MCD events and venues was banned.

==2012 hiatus==
On 21 December 2011, MCD posted a short notice on the Oxegen website confirming rumours that Oxegen 2012 had been cancelled. The statement read as follows: "OXEGEN, like Glastonbury, is taking a year off in 2012 and will be back July 2013. Wishing everyone a very Happy Christmas &amp; peaceful New Year.

==2013 festival==
{{Main|Oxegen 2013}}

MCD chief Denis Desmond revealed, on the official Oxegen website in April 2013, the news that Oxegen will return to the Irish festival line-up this summer, after a one-year hiatus.

The festival took place in its usual home of Punchestown Racecourse in Kildare, and took place on August 2, 3 and 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.joe.ie/entertainment/music/the-first-confirmed-acts-for-oxegen-2013-are-0036859-1|title= The first confirmed acts for Oxegen 2013 are...|date=22 April 2013|work=Joe.ie|accessdate=24 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 22 April an announcement was made to confirm the first set of acts playing. Confirmed were [[Calvin Harris]], [[Rizzle Kicks]], [[Jack Beats]], [[Duke Dumont]], [[Example (musician)|Example]], [[Pitbull (entertainer)|Pitbull]], [[Nero (band)|Nero]]. On 24 April [[David Guetta]] was announced as one of the headline acts. The line-up was heavily criticized for having no guitar bands. The actual announcement posts were deleted on the same day as negative feedback was so heavy that festival promoters urged MCD to remove it to avoid embarrassment.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} It is thought that ticket sales were poor, and this may have been the last time MCD attend the festival. Revellers noted that there were 38 bands above this years headliners in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/oxegens-back-but-is-dj-guetta-really-enough-to-draw-in-the-fans-29219314.html|title= Oxegen's back... but is DJ Guetta really enough to draw in the fans?|date=24 April 2013|work=Evening Herald|accessdate=24 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pest house''', '''plague house''', '''pesthouse''' or '''fever shed''' was a type of building used for persons afflicted with [[communicable disease]]s such as [[tuberculosis]], [[cholera]], [[smallpox]] or [[typhus]]. Often used for forcible [[quarantine]], many towns and cities had one or more pesthouses accompanied by a cemetery or a waste pond nearby for disposal of the dead.

==Fever sheds in Canada==
{{main|Typhus epidemic of 1847}}
Fever sheds were built in several communities across [[Eastern Canada]] in 1847, to quarantine sick and dying [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants, who contracted [[typhus]] during the voyage to the New World during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].
===Montreal===
In [[Montreal]], between 3,500 and 6,000 Irish immigrants died in fever sheds in a quarantine area known as [[Goose Village, Montreal|Windmill Point]]. Three sheds were initially constructed,{{convert|150|ft|m}} long by 40 to {{convert|50|ft|m}} wide. As thousands more sick immigrants landed, more sheds had to be erected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gallagher |first=The Reverend John A. |year=1936 |title=The Irish Emigration of 1847 and Its Canadian Consequences|journal=CCHA Report, University of Manitoba Web Site|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1935-36/Gallagher.html|accessdate=2008-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of sheds would grow to 22, with troops cordoning off the area so the sick could not escape.&lt;ref name="Bruemmer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://montrealnewsinfo.blogspot.com/2009/05/seeking-hope-they-found-death.html|title=Seeking hope, they found death|last=Bruemmer|first=Rene|date=2009-05-30|work=Montreal Gazette|publisher=Canwest|accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toronto===
In [[Toronto]], during the summer of 1847, 863 Irish immigrants died of typhus at fever sheds built by the [[Toronto Board of Health]] at the northwest corner of [[King Street (Toronto)|King]] and [[John Street (Toronto)|John Street]]. There were at least 12 sheds, 22 metres long by 7.5 metres wide. &lt;ref name=toplaques&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto's Historical Plaques|url=http://www.torontoplaques.com/Pages_GHI/Irish_Immigrants_and_the_Fever_Sheds.html|website=Irish Immigrants and the Fever Sheds 1847|accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=BlogTO&gt;{{cite news|title=The UnderTOw: The Fever Sheds|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2007/04/the_undertow_the_fever_sheds/|accessdate=21 January 2012|newspaper=BlogTO|date=11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint John, New Brunswick===
[[Partridge Island, New Brunswick]], just outside the main harbour of [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], was chosen as the location for a pest house and quarantine station as far back as 1785. In 1847, with a large influx of Irish migrants, the typhus epidemic quickly filled the fever shed with sick and dying. By the 1847 typhus season, 2115 people had died in New Brunswick, with 1196 dying at Partridge Island and in Saint John.&lt;ref name=mccord&gt;{{cite web|title=1967.25A-C {{!}} Partridge Island|url=http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/collection/artifacts/1967.25A-C|website=[[McCord Museum]]|accessdate=22 January 2012|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Castle and brewery in Kolín 2.jpg|thumb|Because of a newly painted [[façade]], the whole building looks as if it has been reconstructed although the rest is still in decay (castle brewery in [[Kolín]], [[Czech Republic]])]]
In politics and economics, a '''Potemkin village''' (also '''Potyomkin village''', translated from the {{lang-ru|link=no|потёмкинские деревни|}}, {{IPA-ru|pɐˈtʲɵmkʲɪnskʲɪɪ dʲɪˈrʲɛvnʲɪ}} ''potyomkinskiye derevni'') is any construction (literal or figurative) built solely to deceive others into thinking that a situation is better than it really is. The term comes from stories of a fake portable village built solely to impress Empress [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] by her former lover [[Grigory Potemkin]] during [[Crimean journey of Catherine the Great|her journey to Crimea in 1787]]. While modern historians claim accounts of this portable village are exaggerated, the original story was that Potemkin erected phony portable settlements along the banks of the [[Dnieper River]] in order to impress the Russian Empress; the structures would be disassembled after she passed, and re-assembled farther along her route to be viewed again as if another example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Of Russian origin: Potemkinskie derevni|url=http://russiapedia.rt.com/of-russian-origin/potemkinskie-derevni/|website=Russiapedia|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

[[Grigory Potemkin]] was a minister and lover of the Russian Empress [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]].&lt;ref name="Davies2010"/&gt; After the Russian [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexation of Crimea]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and liquidation of the Cossack [[Zaporozhian Sich]] (see [[New Russia]]), Potemkin became governor of the region. Crimea had been devastated by the war, and the Muslim [[Crimean Tatars|Tatar]] inhabitants of Crimea were viewed as a potential [[fifth column]] of the Ottoman Empire; Potemkin's major tasks were to pacify and rebuild by bringing in Russian settlers. In 1787, as a new war was about to break out between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, Catherine II with her court and several ambassadors made an unprecedented [[Crimean journey of Catherine the Great|six-month trip to New Russia]]. One purpose of this trip was to impress Russia's allies prior to the war. Another purpose was to familiarize herself, supposedly directly, with her new possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=41052102|title=Catherine II Discovers the Crimea|last=Griffiths|first=David|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help accomplish this, Potemkin set up "mobile villages" on the banks of the [[Dnieper River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2008962_2008964_2009010,00.html|title=Top 10 Weird Government Secrets|last=Tharoor|first=Ishaan|date=2010-08-06|work=Time|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as the barge carrying the Empress and ambassadors arrived, Potemkin's men, dressed as peasants, would populate the village. Once the barge left, the village was disassembled, then rebuilt downstream overnight.&lt;ref name="Davies2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman Davies|title=Europe: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vD7SWb5lXBAC&amp;pg=PA658|date=30 September 2010|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-9179-2|pages=658–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical accuracy ===

Modern historians are divided on the degree of truth behind the Potemkin village story, and some writers argue that the story is an exaggeration. According to [[Simon Sebag-Montefiore]], Potemkin's most comprehensive [[english language|English-language]] biographer, the tale of elaborate, fake settlements with glowing fires designed to comfort the monarch and her entourage as they surveyed the barren territory at night, is largely fictional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/031114.html|title=The Straight Dope: Did "Potemkin villages" really exist?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aleksandr Panchenko, an established specialist on 19th-century Russia, used original correspondence and memoirs to conclude that the Potemkin villages are a myth. He writes: "Based on the above said we must conclude that the myth of 'Potemkin villages' is exactly a myth, and not an established fact."&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr Panchenko, [http://ec-dejavu.ru/p/Potemkin_village.html "Potyomkin villages as a cultural myth"], (rus) in Panchenko, O russkoi istorii i kul´ture (Saint-Petersburg, Azbuka, 2000), 416. "В связи с вышесказанным должно сделать заключение, что миф о «потемкинских деревнях» – именно миф, а не достоверно установленный факт."&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that "Potyomkin indeed decorated existing cities and villages, but made no secret that this was a decoration".&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr Panchenko, [http://ec-dejavu.ru/p/Potemkin_village.html "Potemkinskie derevni' kak kul´turnyi mif"], in Panchenko, O russkoi istorii i kul´ture (Saint-Petersburg, Azbuka, 2000), 416. "Потемкин действительно декорировал города и селения, но никогда не скрывал, что это декорации."&lt;/ref&gt;

The close relationship between Potemkin and the empress would make it difficult for him to deceive her. Thus, the deception would have been mainly directed towards the foreign ambassadors accompanying the imperial party.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Norman. ''Europe: A history'', London, Pimlico, 1997, p. 658.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although "Potemkin village" has come to mean, especially in a political context, any hollow or false construct, physical or figurative, meant to hide an undesirable or potentially damaging situation,&lt;ref name="Maxwell2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph A. Maxwell|title=Qualitative Research Design: An Interactive Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAHCOmtAZd0C&amp;pg=PA139|date=8 June 2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=1-4522-8583-7|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible that the phrase cannot be applied accurately to its own original historical inspiration. According to some historians, some of the buildings were real and others were constructed to show what the region would look like in the near future and at least Catherine and possibly also her foreign visitors knew which were which. According to these historians, the claims of deception were part of a defamation campaign against Potemkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2479/did-potemkin-villages-really-exist|title=The Straight Dope: Did "Potemkin villages" really exist?|publisher=|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/history/article12607459/An-Fuerst-Potemkin-war-alles-echt-Auch-die-Doerfer.html|title=Katharina die Grosse: An Fürst Potemkin war alles echt.

* Following the [[Manchurian Incident]], and China's referral of the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] occupation of [[Manchuria]] to the [[League of Nations]] in 1931, the League's representative was given a tour of the "truly Manchurian" parts of the region. It was meant to prove that the area was ''not'' under Japanese domination. Japan withdrew from the League the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Haruo Tohmatsu and H. P. Wilmott.

* The [[Nazi]] [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]], called "the Paradise Ghetto" in [[World War II]], was designed as a concentration camp that could be shown to the [[Red Cross]], but was really a Potemkin village: attractive at first, but deceptive and ultimately lethal, with high death rates from malnutrition and contagious diseases. It ultimately served as a way-station to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].

== In the United States legal system ==
"Potemkin village" is a phrase that has been used by American [[judge]]s, especially members of a multiple-judge panel who dissent from the majority's opinion on a particular matter, to refer to an inaccurate or tortured interpretation and/or application of a particular [[legal doctrine]] to the specific facts at issue. Use of the phrase is meant to imply that the reasons espoused by the panel's majority in support of its decision are not based on accurate or sound law, and their restrictive application is merely a masquerade for the court's desire to avoid a difficult decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Governance: Critical Concepts in Political Science, Volumen 1|last=Sinclair|first=Timothy J.|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2004|isbn=9780415276627|location=|pages= 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://russiapedia.rt.com/of-russian-origin/potemkinskie-derevni/|title=Of Russian origin: Potemkinskie derevni|last=Dmitriev|first=Oleg|date=|website=RT Russia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey]]'' (1992), [[Chief Justice of the United States|chief justice]] of the US, [[William Rehnquist]], wrote that ''[[Roe v.

"The [[affidavit]] is the Potemkin Village of today’s litigation landscape," wrote [[William G. Young]] of the [[District of Massachusetts]].

Sometimes, instead of the full phrase, just "Potemkin" is used, as an adjective. For example, the use of a row of trees to screen a clearcut area from highway drivers has been called a "Potemkin forest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/2/1/1628489/-THE-POTEMKIN-PRESIDENCY|title=THE POTEMKIN PRESIDENCY|work=Daily Kos|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the glossary entry for "clearcut" in ''We Have The Right To Exist: A Translation of Aboriginal Indigenous Thought'' states that "Much of the extensive clearcut in Northern Minnesota is insulated from scrutiny by the urbanized public by a Potemkin forest, or, as the D.N.R. terms it, an aesthetic strip--a thin illusion of forest about six trees deep, along most highways and fronting waters frequented by tourists."&lt;ref name="We Have a Right to Exist: A Translation of Aboriginal Indigenous Thought"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Wub-e-ke-niew|title=We Have The Right To Exist: A Translation of Aboriginal Indigenous Thought|url=http://www.maquah.net/We_Have_The_Right_To_Exist/|website=Maquah.net|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or for example in the phrase "Potemkin court", which implies that the court's reason to exist is being called into question; differing from the phrase "[[kangaroo court]]" with which the court's standard of justice is being impugned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fbj7mv3j2uUC&amp;pg=PT23&amp;lpg=PT23&amp;dq=Potemkin+court&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i7ZfnYsxis&amp;sig=DYP35AK_47kkplJPSzYDrCw0Moo&amp;hl=ja&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH66PdxITWAhUBeSYKHaWDCiE4ChDoAQgqMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Potemkin%20court&amp;f=false|title=International Criminal Justice at the Yugoslav Tribunal: A Judge's Recollection|last=Shahabuddeen|first=Mohamed|date=2012-11-01|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191649851|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General information ==

The [[Defense Science Board]] (DSB) conducted a 2002 "DSB Summer Study on Special Operations and Joint Forces in Support of Countering Terrorism."&lt;ref name=DOD&gt;[[Defense Science Board]], [http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/dod/dsbbrief.ppt "DSB Summer Study on Special Operations and Joint Forces in Support of Countering Terrorism,"] ''U.S. Department of Defense'', Final Outbrief, August 16, 2002; 78 pages (in [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] format).

This is the publicly published U.S. government document which proposes P2OG.&lt;/ref&gt; Excerpts from that study, dated August 16, 2002, recommend the creation of a super-[[Intelligence Support Activity]], an organization it dubs the Proactive, Preemptive Operations Group (P2OG), to bring together [[CIA]] and military [[Covert operation|covert action]], [[information warfare]], intelligence and cover and deception.&lt;ref name=arkin&gt;William M.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Among other things, this body would launch secret operations aimed at "stimulating reactions" among terrorists and states possessing weapons of mass destruction—that is, for instance, prodding terrorist cells into action and exposing themselves to "quick-response" attacks by U.S. forces.

Such tactics would hold "states/sub-state actors accountable" and "signal to harboring states that their sovereignty will be at risk", the briefing paper declares.&lt;ref name=arkin/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3705">The '''Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001''' (asp 14) is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]]. It was passed on 4 October 2001, receiving [[Royal Assent]] on 6 November.&lt;ref name="statutelaw introduction" /&gt;

==Background and legislation==
In January 2000, following the [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution of the Scottish Parliament]] the previous year, [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice|Justice Minister]] [[Jim Wallace, Baron Wallace of Tankerness|Jim Wallace]] announced proposals to reform [[Scots family law|family law in Scotland]], which would include new legislation on [[domestic abuse]].&lt;ref name=BBCJan00 /&gt; Plans to increase protection for victims of domestic violence were temporarily delayed&lt;ref name=BBCSep00 /&gt; but the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] was published in June 2001 and was subsequently passed by the parliament on 4 October.&lt;ref name=BBCOct01 /&gt; The act received Royal Assent on 6 November.&lt;ref name="statutelaw introduction" /&gt;

The act allows [[interdict]]s to be brought against abusers by their victims and gives the police the power to arrest and charge an individual who breaks such an interdict.&lt;ref name="statutelaw introduction" /&gt; By giving the police this new power, the act amends the [[Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981]].&lt;ref name="statutelaw amendment" /&gt; The 2001 act was intended to extend protection to victims of domestic abuse by unmarried and same-sex partners, as well as those no longer in a relationship with their abuser.&lt;ref name=evaluation /&gt;

{{Russo-Georgian war}}
Both sides of the [[Russo-Georgian War|2008 war between Russia and Georgia]] blamed each other for starting the war.

Although the Russian authorities have claimed that it was Georgia that started the war, many reports and researchers (among them independent Russian experts) concluded that the conflict started much earlier than the Georgian military operation began on 7 August at 23:35 and Russia was responsible. The relations between Georgia and Russia deteriorated since Vladimir Putin's rise to power in 1999-2000. South Ossetian separatists began attacking the Georgian villages in early August 2008, in order to force Georgia to respond militarily, thus giving a pretext for planned Russian invasion. Russia was preparing to go to war with Georgia for years before 2008 and intended to achieve geopolitical goals. Some researchers paid attention to the military exercise "Kavkaz 2008", which concluded in early August. During this exercise a written notice entitled "Soldier, know your probable enemy" (the enemy was clarified as Georgia) was circulated among the Russian participants. Russian journalists began arriving in Tskhinvali on 2 August to cover a war that had not yet begun. Some Russian regular troops entered South Ossetia before the Georgian military operation against Tskhinvali began on 7 August.

A European Union investigation claimed that "open hostilities" began with a large-scale Georgian military operation against [[Tskhinvali]] on 7 August, but noted that "a violent conflict had already been going on before in South Ossetia" and Georgian offensive was a "not proportionate" response to pre-war South Ossetian attacks. The commission could not confirm the claimed attack on Russian peacekeepers. The commission further stated that Russian citizenship, conferred to the vast part of Abkhaz and Ossetians can not be considered legally binding, and as a result, the defence of Russian citizens living abroad should not have been used as a reason for starting military action by Russia. The report stated that further Russian advance into Georgia proper was unjustified. The report found that all parties involved in the conflict had violated international law. However, the report was heavily criticised for some of its conclusions.

==Combatants' positions==

===Georgia===
Georgia first said that its military offensive responded to Ossetian shelling of Georgian villages, and it intended to "restore constitutional order" in South Ossetia.&lt;ref name="restore_order"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18941|title='Georgia Decided to Restore Constitutional Order in S.Ossetia'&amp;nbsp;– MoD Official|date=2008-08-08|publisher=Civil.Ge|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jZjDmcaV?url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18941|archivedate=2009-09-06|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=18952|title=Peace Enforcement Measures Underway in S.Ossetia – PM|date=2008-08-08|publisher=Civil.Ge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia also said it aimed to counter a Russian invasion.&lt;ref name=nyt-20081106&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/world/europe/07georgia.html|title=Georgia Claims on Russia War Called Into Question|author1=C.

In an interview with Der Spiegel, Saakashvili said that he "wanted to stop the Russian troops before they could reach Georgian villages." "When our tanks moved toward Tskhinvali, the Russians bombed the city. They were the ones – not us – who reduced Tskhinvali to rubble."&lt;ref name=spiegel1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,578273,00.html |title=Did Saakashvili Lie? The West Begins to Doubt Georgian Leader |publisher=Der Spiegel |date=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia released intercepted telephone calls purporting to show that part of a Russian armoured regiment crossed into South Ossetia nearly a full day before Georgia's attack on the capital, Tskhinvali, late on August 7.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/world/europe/16georgia.html | publisher=The New York Times | first=C.J. | last=Chivers | title=Georgia Offers Fresh Evidence on War's Start | date=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Russia says it acted to defend Russian citizens in South Ossetia, and its own peacekeepers stationed there.&lt;ref name="europe1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7549736.stm |title=Q&amp;A: Conflict in Georgia |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia allegedly suffered casualties during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL8187260 |title=Over 10 Russian peacekeepers killed in S.Ossetia-agencies |agency=Reuters |date=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a senior Russian official, the first Russian combat unit was ordered to move through the Roki Tunnel at around dawn of 8 August (after the Georgian attack had begun).&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Defending Russia's decision to launch attack in uncontested Georgia, Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] has said that Russia had no choice but to target the military infrastructure sustaining the Georgian offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080917/116929528.html |title=South Ossetia conflict FAQs |publisher=RIA Novosti |date=2008-09-20 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417174615/http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080917/116929528.html |archivedate=2009-04-17 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121919150258855111 |title=America Must Choose Between Georgia and Russia |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Russia went as far as accusing Georgia of committing genocide against Ossetians.&lt;ref name="council"/&gt;&lt;ref name="complete genocide"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/08/11/stories/2008081156011500.htm| title=Medvedev, Putin accuse Georgia of genocide |publisher=The Hindu |date=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that Georgia codenamed its attack Operation "Clear Field".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ria.ru/osetia/20080812/150307245.html |script-title=ru:Операция по захвату Южной Осетии называлась "Чистое поле" - Генштаб РФ |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=2008-08-12|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia also claimed that Georgia was planning to launch a two-day Operation "Rock" to retake Abkhazia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lenta.ru/news/2008/08/27/nogovitsyn2/ |script-title=ru:Грузия собиралась захватить Абхазию 9 тысячами солдат |publisher=Lenta.ru |date=2008-08-27|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia codenamed its military action "Operation to Force Georgia to Peace".&lt;ref name=jets&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7550804.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Russian jets attack Georgian town | date=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.embrusscambodia.mid.ru/osetia/osetia-chrono-e.html |title=Short Chronology, Peacekeeping Operation to Force Georgia to Peace |publisher=Embassy of the Russian Federation in the Kingdom of Cambodia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to political scientist [[Svante Cornell]], Moscow spent millions in a public-relations campaign to convince the world that Georgia, not Russia, began the war (despite abundant evidence, including some in Russian media, to the contrary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/17/russia-georgia-obama | publisher=The Guardian |author=Svante Cornell | title=Georgia feels Russia's heavy hand | date=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years after the August War, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev admitted NATO would have been expanded to admit ex-Soviet republics if Russia had not invaded Georgia in 2008 to defend a rebel region. "If you...had faltered back in 2008, the geopolitical situation would be different now," Medvedev said in a speech to soldiers at a [[Vladikavkaz]] base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/11/21/idINIndia-60645720111121 |title=Russia says Georgia war stopped NATO expansion |publisher=Reuters |author=Denis Dyomkin |date=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20111121/168901195.html | publisher=RIA Novosti | title=Russia’s 2008 war with Georgia prevented NATO growth - Medvedev | date=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Vladimir Putin said that Russia had drawn up a plan to counter a Georgian attack long before the August 2008 conflict in the Caucasus. He said the plan was developed by the Russian General Staff in late 2006-early 2007 and it was negotiated with Putin, who was serving his second presidential term in that period. According to Putin, South Ossetian militia were trained under this plan. However, he refused to reveal if he insisted on the use of force when the war began.&lt;ref name="three_days"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rt.com/politics/putin-ossetia-war-plan-168/ | publisher=RT | title=Russia was prepared for Georgian aggression – Putin | date=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beijing"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://voiceofrussia.com//2012_08_08/Russia-had-plan-to-rebuff-Georgian-aggression-Putin/ |title=Russia had plan to rebuff Georgian aggression - Putin |publisher=The Voice of Russia |date=8 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811112633/http://voiceofrussia.com//2012_08_08/Russia-had-plan-to-rebuff-Georgian-aggression-Putin/ |archivedate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Ossetia===

On 18 August 2008, ''[[Le Figaro]]'' published the report by journalist who was told by a young Russian soldier at some checkpoint in Georgia that he came from [[Shali, Chechen Republic]] and that they left on 5 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2008/08/19/01003-20080819ARTFIG00010-nous-ne-laisserons-jamais-l-otan-s-installer-.php |title=Nous ne laisserons jamais l'Otan s'installer |language=fr |publisher=Le Figaro |date=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Georgian military interviews==
Georgian soldiers told EurasiaNet that they thought their initial mission in South Ossetia was to stop attacks on Georgian villages. One senior lieutenant from 4th Brigade said: "Our goal was to put an end to fighting in the area and take control. Nobody in the army expected a war with Russia." One unnamed Georgian defense ministry source said: "The main thing is that the scope of the threat was underestimated, while our own combat capabilities were overestimated." Georgian military sources said that an attack had earlier been expected from Abkhazia, but not from South Ossetia. The 4th Brigade senior lieutenant said that they "were preparing for something in May when Georgia was denied NATO membership [a Membership Action Plan]," but there "were no preparations made" for a military operation in South Ossetia in August. "Many were on vacation and we were preparing to go Iraq in the fall."&lt;ref name="en_sources"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav091508.shtml |title=Georgia: Flaws Found in Tbilisi's War Planning and Operations |publisher=EurasiaNet |date=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 August 2008, the 4th brigade loaded tanks and missile launchers on a train bound for the Georgian city of Gori. On the night of 7–8 August, the 4th Brigade launched a three-pronged offensive on South Ossetian positions in Tskhinvali and in two Ossetian villages - Znauri and Khetagurovo. One of the assaults intended to divert South Ossetian militia forces away from the main objective. After Tskhinvali was nearly encircled, Georgian troops then tried to establish control over a key road to the north, one mid-ranking commander said. The road was being defended by South Ossetian garrison near the village of Tbeti. As Georgian soldiers were engaged with the South Ossetian garrison, the first Russian tanks appeared, the commander said. "We destroyed one tank after another, but they kept coming," the anonymous commander said.&lt;ref name="en_sources"/&gt;

==Phone intercepts==
In September 2008, Georgia released recordings of intercepted phone calls to prove that the Russian military moved into South Ossetia before the Georgian military operation began. ''The New York Times'' made its own translation from the original Ossetian language into Russian and then into English. Senior American officials reviewed the recordings and considered them as credible. The calls were made by Ossetian border guards on a Georgian cellular network. According to a call intercepted at 3:52 AM on 7 August, a supervisor at the South Ossetian border guard headquarters asked a guard at the tunnel with the surname Gassiev: "Listen, has the armor arrived or what?" The guard replied: "The armor and people." Asked if they had gone through, he replied, "Yes, 20 minutes ago; when I called you, they had already arrived."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/2008/09/20080916_Georgia_Transcript.pdf |title=Transcription of the recordings |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 3:41 AM, Gassiev told the supervisor in the first call that a Russian colonel had asked to inspect military vehicles that "crowded" the tunnel. Gassiev said: "The commander, a colonel, approached and said, ‘The guys with you should check the vehicles.’ Is that O.K.?" Asked about the identity of the colonel, Gassiev answered: "I don’t know. Their superior, the one in charge there. The B.M.P.’s and other vehicles were sent here and they’ve crowded there. The guys are also standing around. And he said that we should inspect the vehicles. I don’t know. And he went out." Gassiev informed the supervisor at 3:52 AM that armored vehicles had left the tunnel. They were commanded by a colonel Kazachenko.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Russia did not dispute veracity of the calls. According to Russian press reports after the war, Colonel Andrei Kazachenko who was mentioned in the recording, served in the 135th Motorized Rifle Regiment.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Uvarov claimed that on 7 August Russian peacekeeping contingent in South Ossetia was supplied with fuel and products. Georgia disputed this Russian explanation, arguing that rotations of the Russian peacekeeping battalion could be conducted only in daylight and after not less than a month of advance notification according to a mutual agreement in 2004.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==OSCE monitors==
A former senior [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) official, [[Ryan Grist]], who was in charge of unarmed monitors in South Ossetia at war's start,&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Champion |first=Marc |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122963718776319647 |title=British Monitor Complicates Georgian Blame Game |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; told the [[BBC]] in November 2008 that he had been warning of Georgia's military activity before its move into the South Ossetia region, saying there was a "severe escalation" and that this "would give the Russian Federation any excuse it needed in terms of trying to support its own troops."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7717169.stm |title=OSCE 'failed' in Georgia warnings |publisher=BBC News |date=8 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Grist, it was Georgia that launched the first military strikes against Tskhinvali. "It was clear to me that the [Georgian] attack was completely indiscriminate and disproportionate to any, if indeed there had been any, provocation,” he said. “The attack was clearly, in my mind, an indiscriminate attack on the town, as a town.”&lt;ref name=sundaytimes-20081109&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5114401.ece|title=Georgia fired first shot, say UK monitors|publisher=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=November 9, 2008|author=Jon Swain |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514033051/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5114401.ece |archivedate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grist's views were echoed by Stephen Young, who was another senior OSCE official in Georgia at the time. According to him, there had been no extensive shelling of the Georgian villages on the evening or night of August 7. Young added, that if there had been shelling of Georgian villages that evening, the OSCE monitors at the scene would have heard it. According to him, the monitors only heard occasional small arms fire.&lt;ref name=nyt-20081106 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sundaytimes-20081109 /&gt;

Georgia, and some Western diplomats in Tbilisi later questioned Grist's objectivity.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/article1372117.ece |title=Georgian claims on Russia war undercut |publisher=The Hindu |date=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OSCE curbed the attempts by ''The New York Times'' to interview the monitors, saying they would not be publicly engaged in disagreement.&lt;ref name=nyt-20081106 /&gt; Terhi Hakala, head of the OSCE mission to Georgia, called the monitors' claims "a bit irrelevant."&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt; OSCE Deputy Spokeswoman Virginie Coulloudon told the journalists that the organization's monitors make "patrol reports" from the ground "on a daily basis." Coulloudon also said that "the OSCE is not in a capacity to say who started the war and what happened before the night of [August] 7-8."&lt;ref name="kulakhmetov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Eyewitness_Accounts_Confirm_Shelling_Of_Georgian_Villages/1349256.html |title=Eyewitness Accounts Confirm Shelling Of Georgian Villages |publisher=RFE/RL |date=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists documented dozens of eyewitnesses' accounts that confirmed the reports that Pro-Moscow separatist forces had been shelling the Georgian villages before August 7. The eyewitness accounts are also consistent with a report issued on 5 August 2008, by a tripartite monitoring group, which included Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) observers and representatives of Russian peacekeepers in the region. The report, signed by the commander of Russian peacekeepers, General Marat Kulakhmetov, said there was evidence of attacks against ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia. The report also stated that South Ossetian separatists were using heavy weapons against the Georgian villages, which was prohibited by a 1992 cease-fire agreement.&lt;ref name="kulakhmetov"/&gt;

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (WSJ) wrote that in an interview Grist acknowledged he crossed through Russian lines without authorization on his own initiative to determine the facts, which ultimately cost him his OSCE job. He was forced to resign from the OSCE immediately after the war. WSJ adds Grist remains "scathing" about Georgian actions before and during the war, but says that some of his comments have been overinterpreted and quotes Grist saying "I have never said there was no provocation by the South Ossetians." "What I have said is that the response from the Georgian authorities was absolutely disproportionate," said Ryan Grist.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Ryan Grist said that on 12 August he went to visit a friend in Tskhinvali, [[Lira Tskhovrebova]], who was well connected with the separatist authorities. Friends took him to see two top South Ossetian officials. On the road to [[Tbilisi]] Grist was stopped by South Ossetian militia. He shouted the names of the officials he had just been meeting "so they wouldn't shoot" him.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt; In December 2008, an investigation by the [[Associated Press]] revealed that Lira Tskhovrebova was not an independent activist as she claimed. She was allegedly connected to South Ossetian KGB and Russian intelligence agency, the [[Federal Security Service|FSB]]. [[Matthew Bryza]], Deputy Assistant Secretary of State of the United States, also expressed his doubts about Tskhovrebova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rawstory.com/news/2008/AP_claims_South_Ossetia_activist_KGB_1215.html |title=Georgia charges South Ossetia activist is KGB spy |date=2008-12-15 |author1=David Edwards |author2=Muriel Kane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_n6YF1UvQk |title=South Ossetia Fighting: Independent or a Plant? |publisher=Associated Press |date=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Georgian Parliamentary Commission Report==
A Georgian parliamentary commission, which studied the war, released a report on 18 December 2008.&lt;ref name="pcr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=20158 |title=War Commission Releases Report |publisher=Civil.Ge |date=2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.ge/files/1329_22127_506571_Conclusion_E.pdf |title=PARLIAMENTARY TEMPORARY COMMISSION ON INVESTIGATION OF THE MILITARY AGGRESSION AND OTHER ACTS OF RUSSIA AGAINST THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF GEORGIA |publisher=Parliament of Georgia |date=2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report said in its beginning that Russia’s aggression against Georgia did not start in August 2008 and recalled the events in Abkhazia and South Ossetia in early 90s. The report then gave a detailed timeline of events preceding the war. It also said that the Georgian authorities' failure "to de-legitimize the presence of Russian peacekeepers can be considered the major shortcoming of the Georgian authorities in a pre-August period." The Russian peacekeepers were full-pledge participants of the aggression against Georgia, according to the commission. "On the one hand, Russia used ‘attack’ on ‘peacekeepers’ as one of the pretexts for launching the aggression and on the other hand, [attacks] were carried out on the Georgian citizens from their [peacekeepers’] headquarters [which was based on Tskhinvali]."&lt;ref name="pcr"/&gt;

The report said that despite having information on tensions in the South Ossetian conflict zone, the Georgian authorities failed "to properly analyze" the scales of the threat. "The Georgian authorities perceived large-scale Russian military exercises at the Georgian borders in late July and continuing attacks in the conflict zone as a traditional wave of provocations." The report also criticized the National Security Council (NSC), "It is obvious that the Security Council has failed to plan the actions in a timely manner, which would have been adequate to the anticipated situation and consequently, from the morning of August 7 it had to act in force majeure regime." The commission said that the government members’ actions during the war sometimes lacked coordination. The report said that the government did not stick to the formal procedures laid out in the special decree envisaging setting up of a governmental commission during the emergency situations. The commission also criticized the Georgian Foreign Ministry, saying that "there is no special action plan and written instructions for ambassadors on how to act in the emergency situations; the activities of ambassadors are not controlled properly either."&lt;ref name="pcr"/&gt;

The report also says that "serious shortcomings" were revealed in the defense system. The commission said that "problems persisted in the communication system." It also said that the war revealed "inadequacy" of the reserve troops system. "The Defense Ministry has failed to carry out strategic planning properly," the report continued.&lt;ref name="pcr"/&gt;

The commission called on the General Prosecutor’s Office to investigate all the cases of violation of international humanitarian law regardless of who has committed them on either side.&lt;ref name="pcr"/&gt;

==EU Independent Fact Finding Mission Report==
An independent, international fact-finding mission headed by Swiss diplomat [[Heidi Tagliavini]] was established by the EU to determine the causes of the war. The commission was given a budget of €1.6 million and relied on the expertise of military officials, political scientists, historians and international law experts.{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/a-shattered-dream-in-georgia-eu-probe-creates-burden-for-saakashvili-a-630543.html |title=A Shattered Dream in Georgia: EU Probe Creates Burden for Saakashvili |last=Klussmann |first=Uwe |date=2009-08-25 |publisher=Spiegel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was published on 30 September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/287861,report-blames-georgia-for-starting-war-with-russia-newspapers.html |title=Report blames Georgia for starting war with Russia: newspapers |publisher=EarthTimes |date=2009-09-30 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kEYBvL5m?url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/287861,report-blames-georgia-for-starting-war-with-russia-newspapers.html |archivedate=October 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/30/russia-georgia-war-eu-inquiry |title=Russia and Georgia set to share blame for South Ossetia conflict |date=2009-09-30 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc_tagliavini"/&gt; The report said it could not claim "veracity or completeness in an absolute sense", since it incorporated what had been available to the Mission at the time of writing.{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=8}}

The report claimed that open hostilities started "... with a large-scale Georgian military operation against the town of Tskhinvali and the surrounding areas, launched in the night of 7 to 8 August 2008", but "... any explanation of the origins of the conflict cannot focus solely on the artillery attack on Tskhinvali in the night of 7/8 August" since "... it was only the culminating point of a long period of increasing tensions, provocations and incidents", and there was "... no way to assign overall responsibility for the conflict to one side alone."{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=19}}{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=31}}{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=11}}{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=32}} The beginning of the armed conflict between Georgia and South Ossetia was dated by the commission to 7 August 2008 at 23.35;{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=230}} however, the commission acknowledged that "a violent conflict had already been going on before in South Ossetia," and "President Saakashvili’s order on 7 August 2008 at 23.35 and the ensuing military attack on Tskhinvali [...] has to be seen as but one element in an on-going chain of events for military violence had also been reported before the outbreak of the open hostilities on 7 August 2008."{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=230}}{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=231}} The open hostilities between Georgia and Russia are considered to have begun on 8 August 2008.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=230}} The report acknowledged that "volunteers or mercenaries" entered Georgia from Russia before the Georgian military operation and there was the presence of "some" non-peacekeeping Russian troops in South Ossetia before the public decision for an intervention was made by the Russian leadership.{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=20}}

The commission said that a government "is generally not prevented" from using armed force in internal conflicts, e.g. against insurgents starting a civil war or against violent secessionists.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=239}} However, the report said that Georgia had a non-use of force commitment under the legally binding international documents, such as the 1992 Sochi Agreement and 1996 Memorandum on Measures to Provide Security and Strengthen Mutual Trust between the Sides in the Georgian-South Ossetian Conflict.{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=22}}

The commission said that the South Ossetian attacks on Georgian villages (Zemo Nikozi, Kvemo Nikozi, Avnevi, Nuli, Ergneti, Eredvi and Zemo Prisi) were equivalent to an "attack by the armed forces of a State on the territory of another State" resembling the situations described in Art. 3(a) of UN Resolution 3314.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=244}} As the South Ossetian attacks were "primarily" directed against Georgian peacekeepers and against Georgian police, this was an attack by the South Ossetian armed forces on the land forces of Georgia.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=245}} The commission also said "To the extent that South Ossetian militia initiated the shooting on Georgian villages, police and peacekeepers before the outbreak of the armed conflict," South Ossetia violated the prohibition of the use of force.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=262}} It also noted that Georgian attack on 7 August was a response, albeit not proportionate, to South Ossetian attacks in the following paragraphs:
{{Quotation|"To the extent that the attacks on Georgian villages, police and peacekeepers were conducted by South Ossetian militia, self-defence in the form of on-the-spot reactions by Georgian troops was necessary and proportionate and thus justified under international law.
On the other hand, the offensive that started on 7 August, even if it were deemed necessary, was not proportionate to the only permissible aim, the defence against the on-going attacks from South Ossetia."{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=251}} }}

As far as legality of use of force by Russia was concerned, the report took a "differentiated" approach, dividing "the Russian reaction to the Georgian attack" into two phases – the one, which was the immediate reaction "in order to defend Russian peacekeepers" in Tskhinvali and the second one, "the invasion of Georgia by Russian armed forces reaching far beyond the administrative boundary of South Ossetia",{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=23}} which was "beyond the reasonable limits of defence".{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=24}}

The commission stated that an attack by Georgian forces on Russian peacekeepers deployed in Georgia – "if not in self-defence against a Russian attack", would not be justified.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=265}} However, the commission concluded that an attack on Russian peacekeepers was not a sufficient condition to be used for self-defence by Russia and "the fact of the Georgian attack on the Russian peacekeepers’ basis could not be definitely confirmed by the mission."{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=268}} The commission said that Russian peacekeepers, if they "had been directly attacked", had the right to immediate, necessary and proportionate response.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=270}} However, "doubts remain whether the Russian peacekeepers were attacked in the first place,"{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=270}} and the mission could not establish whether, at the time of the alleged attacks on Russian peacekeepers’ bases, the peacekeepers had lost their protection due to their participation in the hostilities.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=327}} The commission concluded that the expulsion of the Georgian forces from South Ossetia, and the defence of South Ossetia as a whole was not a legitimate objective,{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=274}} and according to international law, the Russian actions as a whole, were not neither "necessary nor proportionate" to protect Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=275}} The commission concluded that Russia did not have the right to justify its actions as "a mere reinforcement and fulfilment" of its peacekeeping mission.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=276}}

The commission concluded that the South Ossetian separatists could not validly invite Russia to support them militarily.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=280}} It also concluded that "Russian military activities against the Georgian military forces were not justified as collective self-defence under international law."{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=283}} The commission also concluded that Russian military actions also could not be justified as a humanitarian intervention.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=284}}

The report further stated that Russian citizenship, conferred to the vast part of Abkhaz and Ossetians can not be considered legally binding under international law. The purportedly naturalised Abkhazs and South Ossetians are not Russian nationals according to international law.{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=18}} The commission said that the constitutional obligation to protect Russian nationals could not serve as a justification for intervention under international law. Russian domestic law could not be invoked as a justification for a breach of an international law.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=288}} The commission concluded that Russian intervention in Georgia was not justified as a rescue operation for Russian citizens in Georgia.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=289}}

With respect to the war's second theater, the report found the joint Abkhaz-Russian attack on the [[Kodori Gorge]] was unjustified under international law and was an illegal use of force.{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=25}} Russian support of Abkhazia was not justified as collective self-defence in favour of Abkhazia, because third-party involvement in an internal military conflict in support of the seceding party is not allowed.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=293}} The commission concluded: "The use of force by Abkhazia was not justified under international law and was thus illegal. The same applies to the Russian support for Abkhaz use of force."{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=294}} General Russian involvement in the conflict in Georgia was a violation of the fundamental international legal prohibition of the use of force.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=264}}

The report found that Russian and South Ossetian allegations of genocide committed by the Georgian side were "neither founded in law nor substantiated by factual evidence."{{sfn|Volume I|2009|pp=26-27}} The report found that during the conflict "all sides to the conflict - Georgian forces, Russian forces and South Ossetian forces - committed violations of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law."{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=26}} The report also found facts of ethnic cleansing of Georgians, saying that "several elements suggest the conclusion that ethnic cleansing was indeed practised against ethnic Georgians in South Ossetia both during and after the August 2008 conflict."{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=27}} The commission said that in many cases Russian forces did not act to prevent or stop South Ossetian forces from committing acts of deliberate violence against civilians during the conflict and after the cease-fire.{{sfn|Volume II|2009|p=352}}

The report also concluded that South Ossetia and Abkhazia did not have a right to secede from Georgia (which they did in the early 1990s), because according to the ''uti possidetis'' principle, only constituent republics such as Georgia, but not territorial sub-units such as South Ossetia or Abkhazia had the right to independence during the breakup of the Soviet Union. Their recognition was "consequently" contrary to international law.{{sfn|Volume I|2009|p=17}}

=== Comments and criticism ===
In February 2009, a high-ranking Georgian official suspected that one German expert, that submitted a research paper to Tagliavini, worked for organizations financed by Russian energy company [[Gazprom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/world/europe/01russia.html |title=Georgia Challenges Report That Says It Fired First Shot |publisher=The New York Times |date=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expertclub.ge/DesktopDefault.aspx?cnid=2291&amp;alias=Expertclub&amp;lang=en&amp;tabid=2546 |title=Member of the EU commission received money from Gazprom |publisher=expertclub.ge |date=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, before the report was published, former Estonian Prime Minister [[Mart Laar]] said in an interview: "[They seem to be] looking at things from a very, we can say, interesting point of view, forgetting history, forgetting context, and forgetting one simple point: that during the war, no Georgian soldier, no plane, no other military equipment left the legal, internationally recognized territory of Georgia. It was Georgian territory, and no Georgian soldier [left] the borders of Georgia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Estonian_Signatory_Laar_Champions_Stand_Up_For_Georgia_Letter/1837609.html |title=Estonian Signatory Mart Laar Champions 'Stand Up For Georgia' Letter |publisher=RFE/RL |date=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the report was published, a spokesman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, [[:ru:Лякин-Фролов, Игорь Семёнович|Igor Lyakin-Frolov]], said the Russian side had been "absolutely fair and honest" with Tagliavini's commission and felt optimistic about the report's objectivity. He said Russia was hoping that the commission would allocate blame to the countries that helped arm Georgia, in particular [[Ukraine]]. He added that Russia would consider it "unfair" if the investigation divided blame for the war equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/world/europe/29georgia.html |title=E.U. Report to Place Blame on Both Sides in Georgia War |publisher=The New York Times |date=2009-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU countries declared in a statement the report was not about apportioning blame, but they stated it could "contribute toward a better understanding of the origins and the course of last year's conflict".&lt;ref name="bbc_tagliavini"&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia 'started unjustified war'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8281990.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgian state minister for reintegration told the BBC that, although most of the facts in the report were accurate, he disagreed with some parts of it. "I disagree with the notion that Georgia used excessive force in the attack on Tskhinvali because, as I mentioned, there are ample evidences of Russian deployment and these were not just peacekeepers, so one can hardly judge what is proportionate," said [[Temur Iakobashvili]]. "One can hardly judge what is proportionate or disproportionate in this case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8284046.stm |title=Uncomfortable conclusions for Georgia |publisher=BBC |date=2009-09-30 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Svante E. Cornell argued that although Tagliavini’s report did claim that Georgia started the war, that should not be confused with the question of responsibility. He also criticised the argument that Georgia was legally bound by agreements not to use force, because the mission failed to discuss their validity if broken by either the South Ossetians or by Russia. Cornell also criticised the report for not taking account of the considerable evidence accumulated by scholars such as Andrey Illarionov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.cacianalyst.org/?q=node/5188 |title=EU INQUIRY REJECTS RUSSIA’S JUSTIFICATIONS FOR GEORGIA WAR |publisher=CACI Analyst |date=2009-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831140201/http://old.cacianalyst.org/?q=node%2F5188 |archivedate=2014-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Yulia Latynina]], Russian journalist, criticised the Tagliavini report, saying: "A war, it turns out, is begun by he [sic] who responds to the actions of an aggressor [...]. So when Ossetian 'volunteers' burn Georgian villages - that is not a war. But if they [the Georgians] respond to this, then here you, accursed ones, have started a war. Following the logic of the Tagliavini commission, the Georgians ought not to have responded. Even if Russian tanks had reached Tbilisi, and the Georgians had responded, they, the swine, would have started a war. The logic is irreproachable: if the Georgians had not responded, there would have been no war." Latynina argued that according to the Tagliavini mission "Georgia had no right to send a single shell into the city [of Tskhinvali]. But the opposite side had a right to burn down Nuli, and that was not an infringement of human rights." Latynina concluded that the commission showed a "cowardice" before "an international hooligan" Vladimir Putin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMST94dSPTUC |title=Russia and its Near Neighbours |year=2012 |pages=98–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2010/10/18/605/ |script-title=ru:Августовская война 08.08.08: Кто начал первым? |publisher=Українська правда |date=2010-10-18|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of Russian peacekeepers==
&lt;!--Some sources spell the family name as Golovanov while the later sources spell it as Galavanov--&gt;On 12 August 2008, ''Life.ru'' reported that several Russian peacekeepers were buried in [[Vladikavkaz]].

In October 2008, [[:ru:Тимерман, Константин Анатольевич|Konstantin Timerman]], the commander of the Russian peacekeeping battalion said in an interview with ''[[Izvestia]]'' that on the morning of 8 August the Russians opened fire in response only after the Georgians had opened fire on the observer post in the southern part of Tskhinvali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://izvestia.ru/news/341319 |script-title=ru:Герой России Константин Тимерман: "Наши парни погибли не для того, чтобы мы сдались" |publisher=Izvestia |date=2008-10-02|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Russian side told the Tagliavini commission that the Russian peacekeepers suffered the first casualties at 6:35 AM on 8 August, when the Georgian tank was firing on the observer post on the roof of the peacekeepers' base. As a result one soldier of the battalion died, another one was wounded and the part of the building was destroyed.

==WikiLeaks==
After the disclosure of alleged US diplomatic cables by [[WikiLeaks]], the dispatches sent during the initial stage of the war from Tbilisi were published. Former US Ambassador to Georgia [[John F. Tefft]] alleged that the Georgians did not intend to start the conflict, but rather were dragged into the war. The diplomat’s cables were initially published by Russian Reporter magazine, a Moscow-based weekly.&lt;ref name="eurasialeaks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/62481 |title=Georgia: Can WikiLeaks Cables Change the Russia-Georgia War Narrative? |publisher=EurasiaNet |date=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“From evidence available to us it appears the South Ossetians started today’s fighting,” reads an alleged August 8 dispatch from Tefft. “The Georgians are now reacting by calling up more forces and assessing their next move. It is unclear to the Georgians, and to us, what the Russian angle is and whether they are supporting South Ossetians, or actively trying to help control the situation.”&lt;ref name="eurasialeaks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rusrep"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rusrep.ru/article/2010/11/29/wikileaks_docs_02 |title=Война с Грузией |publisher=Russian Reporter |date=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly wrote on August 8 that “As late as 22:30 Georgian Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials were still hopeful that the unilateral cease-fire announced by President Saakashvili will hold. Only when the South Ossetians opened up with artillery on Georgian villages, did the offensive to take Tskhinvali begin.” “All evidence available to the country team supports [Georgian President Mikheil] Saakashvili’s statement that this fight was not Georgia’s original intention,” reads the cable. “Key Georgian officials, who would have had responsibility for an attack on South Ossetia have been on leave, and the Georgians only began mobilizing August 7 once the attack was well underway.”&lt;ref name="eurasialeaks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wikileaks"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08TBILISI1341_a.html |title=GEORGIA: SOUTH OSSETIA SITREP 2: GEORGIA CLAIMS TO CONTROL MUCH OF SOUTH OSSETIA, FIGHTING CONTINUES |publisher=WikiLeaks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cables also describe the chronology of events.&lt;ref name="wikileaks"/&gt; On 7 August, when the fighting escalated, Deputy Foreign Minister [[Grigol Vashadze]] told the US Ambassador that "heavy Russian equipment was being moved south from Java - a military base north of the conflict zone , which Georgians have not seen -- even in tense times -- in the past."&lt;ref name="rusrep"/&gt; When General Kulakhmetov, the Head of the Russian peacekeepers in Tskhinvali, met with [[Temur Iakobashvili]], Kulakhmetov said that he "does not control anything" and that the South Ossetians were "shooting at the Georgians behind my back."&lt;ref name="wikileaks"/&gt;

EurasiaNet.org contacted the US Embassy in [[Kiev]], where Tefft then served, in an attempt to confirm the veracity of the cables. But the embassy declined to comment. Several Russian commentators have interpreted the same cables differently, saying that this proved that the Georgians started the war.&lt;ref name="eurasialeaks"/&gt;

==Statements by Commanders-in-chief==

{{flagicon|Georgia}} On 11 August 2008, Georgian president [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] wrote: "The Kremlin designed this war. Earlier this year, Russia tried to provoke Georgia by effectively annexing another of our separatist territories, Abkhazia. When we responded with restraint, Moscow brought the fight to South Ossetia. Ostensibly, this war is about an unresolved separatist conflict. Yet in reality, it is a war about the independence and the future of Georgia. And above all, it is a war over the kind of Europe our children will live in. Let us be frank: This conflict is about the future of freedom in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121841306186328421 |title=The War in Georgia Is a War for the West |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Georgia}} On 24 August 2008, Georgian president [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] had a lengthy televised speech. He remembered that after [[2004 Adjara crisis]] he phoned President Putin and thanked him. "I remember that conversation very well; in response to my polite remarks, he said roughly: ‘Now remember, in Adjara we did not intervene, but you won’t have any gifts from us in South Ossetia or Abkhazia.’ That’s what he said to me." He then said "I suppose that Russia started thinking about military intervention in Georgia sometime in 2007." "[In July 2007] Russia announced a withdrawal from the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, limiting military forces in [Europe] and the Caucasus." Saakashvili then slammed the EU’s reaction to Russia’s admission of violating Georgian airspace in July 2008. "This admission by Russia was a clear sign that they were testing western reaction," he stated. Saakashvili said that his first meeting with Medvedev in June 2008 in St. Petersburg was good; while at the next meeting with Medvedev in Astana in July 2008, the Russian president’s stance was changed and "it was clear that they [Russia] were preparing for something bad." Saakashvili said that Georgia had expected a Russian attack from Abkhazia, rather than from South Ossetia, so major forces of the Georgian army were deployed in the Georgia's west. He said that as the situation deteriorated on 7 August, "we moved one brigade [of the Georgian armed forces] closer to South Ossetia, and later another [brigade] as well." "But our major forces were still deployed in the west; there was a brigade at Senaki [a military base] and we did not call back our brigade from Iraq, because I was deeply convinced up to the last minute that Russia would not engage in such a large-scale provocation," he said. "Although we were under fire from 120mm mortar launchers, I announced a unilateral ceasefire; at that time we already had one dead soldier in the village of Avnevi and four others were wounded; [Georgian Defense Minister Davit] Kezerashvili was begging me to let him open artillery fire, because, he was telling me, otherwise he was unable to bring [the wounded soldiers] from [the village]. But my response was that we could not open fire whatever happened," he said. Saakashvili also said that the Russian army had moved into South Ossetia before the war had even started. "When we ask our western partners: didn't you see them coming, they respond that their satellites were directed mainly on Iraq and that they could not fly over [Georgia], but it was impossible to see what was happening on the ground because it was cloudy. So it was a serious failure of international intelligence services; they would not have hidden this information from us, if they had known it; but they also did not know it," Saakashvili said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=19282 |title=Saakashvili’s Account of Events that Led to Conflict |publisher=Civil.Ge |date=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Georgia}} In late August 2008, Georgian president Saakashvili said that he expected threat from Abkhazia and had most of the troops stationed near Abkhazia, adding: "I can tell you that if we'd intended to attack, we'd have withdrawn our best-trained forces from Iraq up front." He also said: "Some months ago, I was warned by Western leaders in Dubrovnik to expect an attack this summer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121988657412478425 |title=How the Georgian Conflict Really Started |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Russia}} On 1 October 2008, [[Dmitry Medvedev]] said: "During this time we demonstrated that Russia is a state that can defend its citizens and whose opinions should be taken into consideration by various countries, including by those that protect themselves by making friends with greater states."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=19644 |title=Medvedev: Russia Acted Legally in August War |publisher=Civil.Ge |date=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Georgia}} In November 2008, Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili at a conference in [[Riga]], claimed that the August conflict in the Caucasus began in Ukraine when the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]] left the base six days before the large-scale hostilities broke out. According to him, Ukrainian president [[Viktor Yushchenko]] tried unsuccessfully to stop the Russian fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2008/11/5/4454316/ |script-title=ru:Саакашвили считает, что российско-грузинская война началась из Украины |date=2008-11-05 |publisher=Ukrainska Pravda|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosbalt.ru/exussr/2008/11/05/538693.html |script-title=ru:Саакашвили: Война на Кавказе началась с Украины |date=2008-11-05 |publisher=RosBalt|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Georgia}} In December 2008, Georgian President Saakashvili declared: "I have always openly acknowledged that I ordered military action in South Ossetia -- as any responsible democratic leader would have done, and as the Georgian Constitution required me to do in defense of the country. I made this decision after being confronted by two facts. First, Russia had massed hundreds of tanks and thousands of soldiers on the border between Russian and Georgia in the area of South Ossetia. (...) Second, for a week Russian forces and their proxies engaged in a series of deadly provocations, shelling Georgian villages that were under my government's control -- with much of the artillery located in Tskhinvali, often within sites controlled by Russian peacekeepers. Then, on Aug. 7, Russia and its proxies killed several Georgian peacekeepers." He also said that when the crisis began to escalate, he tried to call Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on both August 6 and 7, but he did not answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122817723737570713 |title=Georgia Acted in Self-Defense |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Russia}} In August 2011, Dmitry Medvedev said: "The moment of truth for me, as I realized later while analyzing those events in hindsight over and over again, came with the visit by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice." "Following that visit, my Georgian colleague simply dropped all communication with us. He simply stopped talking to us, he stopped writing letters and making phone calls. It was apparent that he had new plans now. And those plans were implemented later." Medvedev also said that he decided to attack Georgia without consulting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, and that the two did not have a conversation until the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/06/world/europe/06russia.html |title=Russian President Says U.S. Had Role in Georgian Conflict |author=Ellen Barry |publisher=The New York Times |date=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Russia}} On 8 August 2012, Russian Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said: "Yes, we had our own relations with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, nonetheless considering in that moment Georgia's territorial integrity, however we had understood too that this was practically impossible." "I made my decision two-and-a-half hours after the Georgian army began the active fighting. Not earlier, because this was wrong, since this was the decision to use the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation on foreign soil, I underline, the foreign territory. But not later too," he said. He also said that he contacted Putin on 8 August.&lt;ref name="vz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vz.ru/politics/2012/8/8/592472.html |script-title=ru:«Грузины уже заняли высоты» |publisher=Vzglyad |date=2012-08-08|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/military/20120808/175075038.html |title=Medvedev Defends His Georgia Attack Decision in 2008 |publisher=RIA Novosti |date=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Georgia}} In 2014, former president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili published an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' where he wrote that for months prior to August 2008, "unidentified troops" "grabbed more and more control over Georgia's separatist regions, and were getting into a growing number of shooting matches with local law enforcement." According to him, Russian tank columns started to move into Georgia to the point when, on 7 August 2008, the Georgian armed forces were compelled to respond. Saakashvili claimed that if Georgia had not responded, Russian special forces could have easily reached Tbilisi within 24 hours. He claimed that he "couldn't afford to wait." By military response he managed "to gain time, raise the stakes, and ultimately save ... statehood and democracy." He pointed out if the west had reacted "properly" to the war in Georgia, "Ukraine would never have happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/14/georgia-lesson-for-ukraine-crimea-referendum-trick |title=Let Georgia be a lesson for what will happen to Ukraine |author=Mikheil Saakashvili |publisher=The Guardian |date=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statements by politicians==
{{flagicon|Abkhazia}} On 7 August, state-owned [[Russia-1|Rossiya TV]] showed [[Sergei Bagapsh]], the president of Abkhazia, speaking at a meeting of the Abkhaz National Security Council. Bagapsh said: "I have spoken to the president of South Ossetia. It has more or less stabilized now.

{{flagicon|United States}} On 7 August 2008, Assistant Secretary of State [[Daniel Fried]] said: "It appears that the South Ossetians have instigated this uptick in violence." "We have urged the Russians to urge their South Ossetian friends to pull back and show greater restraint. And we believe that the Russians ... are trying to do just that." Fried did not think the Russians had encouraged the South Ossetians to stir unrest. "There's no evidence that the Russians are pushing them," he stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/08/07/us-georgia-ossetia-usa-idUSN0732667120080807 |title=U.S., Russia making S.

{{flagicon|Sweden}} On 8 August 2008, Swedish [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] [[Carl Bildt]] said that the crisis was due to provocations from the South Ossetian side and that Georgian forces were trying to restore "the constitutional order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article3059024.ab | title=Carl Bildt oroad över utvecklingen | publisher=Aftonbladet | date=2008-08-08|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August, Bildt evoked the memory of [[Adolf Hitler]] in condemning Russia's attack on Georgia, saying the protection of Russian citizens does not justify the invasion. "No state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state," he also said. "Attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged Europe into war in the past... And we have reason to remember how Hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/13596/20080809/ |title=Sweden invokes Hitler in condemning Russian assault |date=2008-08-09 |publisher=The Local}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.government.se/sb/d/587/a/109203 |title=Russia's justification of its offensive deeply ominous |publisher=Government Offices of Sweden |date=9 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817123321/http://www.government.se/sb/d/587/a/109203 |archivedate=17 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United Nations}} A [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] diplomat said: "Strategically, the Russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles, and they’re upset about Kosovo."&lt;ref name="nyt_kosovo"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/world/europe/10diplo.html?ref=asia | publisher=The New York Times | title=In Georgia Clash, a Lesson on U.S. Need for Russia | first=Helene | last=Cooper | date=9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Georgia}} In late August 2008, Batu Kutelia, the deputy defence minister told the ''[[Financial Times]]'' that Georgia made the decision to seize [[Tskhinvali]] despite the fact that Georgia did not have enough anti-tank and air defences to protect itself against the possibility of serious resistance. He said that "At some point there was no choice." He also said that Georgia did not believe Russia would respond to its offensive against South Ossetia and was completely unprepared for the counter-attack that followed. "I didn't think it likely that a member of the UN Security Council and the OSCE would react like this," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/90d1d4c6-6fe0-11dd-986f-0000779fd18c.html |title=Tbilisi admits it miscalculated Russian reaction |author=Jan Cienski |publisher=Financial Times |date=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Russia}} In August 2008, Modest Kolerov, former head of the Department for international and cultural ties with foreign countries of the President’s Office, admitted that the Kremlin had "a clear plan of action in the case of a conflict", and "the expediency with which the military operation was executed confirms that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianews.ru/press/16975-16975 |script-title=ru:Есть ли у них план? |date=13 August 2008 |publisher=Русские новости |language=ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820121718/http://www.russianews.ru/press/16975-16975 |archivedate=20 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|South Ossetia}} In August 2008, Vadim Kozaev, employee of Ministry of Internal Affairs of [[North Ossetia–Alania]], and his brother Vladislav Kozaev, hero of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, alleged that [[Eduard Kokoity]], the president of South Ossetia, knew in advance that the war was coming and fled [[Tskhinvali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/Doc/1018914 |script-title=ru:Южная Осетия не выдает России ее граждан |publisher=Kommersant |date=2008-09-01|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} In August 2008, [[Steven Pifer]], former Ambassador to Ukraine, said that Russian rhetoric and media narrative suggested they were preparing a large-scale operation. "The rhetoric that is coming out of Moscow, ethnic cleansing and genocide, is just way over the top," he said. "It's almost approaching the point where there is just no relationship to reality. But again, certainly the rhetoric is appropriate to a larger operation against Georgia to just stop and reverse whatever military gains the Georgians made in South Ossetia on [August 7]." Pifer said that Russia laid a well-prepared trap and the Georgians took the bait. "The Georgian leadership made a mistake on [August 7]. They should have understood from what they have seen from the Russians that the Russians were looking for a pretext. They [the Georgians] gave them that pretext when they decided to go in a fairly large way into South Ossetia," he said. "The speed of the Russian response suggests that the Russians were ready, they were just waiting for the reason and they took that as the reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Russia_Georgian_Scripted_Affair/1193319.html |title=Scene At Russia-Georgia Border Hinted At Scripted Affair |publisher=RFE/RL |date=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} On 8 September 2008, [[Dana Rohrabacher]] (a senior [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[United States House of Representatives]]) Foreign Affairs Committee, argued at a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee meeting, according to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', that Georgia started the fighting on August 7, citing unidentified intelligence sources. Further, Telegraph reported that "Mr Rohrbacher insisted that Georgia was to blame", citing him: "The Georgians broke the truce, not the Russians, and no amount of talk of provocation and all this other stuff can alter that fact." Telegraph stated: "His comments got little attention in the United States but have been played prominently on state-run Russian television bulletins and other media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/2827424/Rebel-Republican-congressman-Dana-Rohrabacher-backs-Russia-over-Georgia.html|title=Rebel Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher backs Russia over Georgia|publisher=The Telegraph|date=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Russia}} In September 2008, Russian Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] told reporters that Russia had no choice but to attack Georgia as Russia had been encircled on all sides. He said that Georgia "attacked South Ossetia with missiles, tanks, heavy artillery and ground troops. What were we supposed to do?" He claimed that if his country had not invaded, it would have been like Russia "getting a bloody nose and hanging its head down", and there would be a "second blow" into the North Caucasus. He insisted that President Dmitry Medvedev, not he, took all decisions regarding the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyindia.com/show/272153.php |title=Encircled Russia had to attack to avoid "bloody nose" by Georgia: Putin |publisher=DailyIndia |date=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Georgia}} After the war, [[Irakli Okruashvili]], who served as Defense Minister of Georgia, claimed that he and President Saakashvili had drawn up plans to retake South Ossetia and Abkhazia in 2005, Abkhazia being the strategic priority. The alleged original plans called for a two-pronged offensive into South Ossetia aimed at taking Tskhinvali, the Roki Tunnel, and [[Java (town)|Java]]. Saakashvili believed that the United States would block a response by Russia through diplomatic channels, so he did not order the taking of the Roki Tunnel. When Russian forces responded, Georgian forces raced to contain them, but were outmaneuvered by the Russians. Okruashvili said that Russian response would be "inevitable" as after 2006, Russians repositioned and improved their military infrastructure in the North Caucasus, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. The Georgian Army could have defended a few key towns from the Russians, but President Saakashvili "let the Russians in to avoid criticism and appear more of a victim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/09/14/us-georgia-russia-opposition-idUSLD12378020080914 |title=Saakashvili "planned S.

{{flagicon|United States}} In September 2008, [[Matthew Bryza]], the deputy assistant secretary of State, said the contents of the recorded phone conversations (which were presented as evidence of Russian invasion on 7 August) were consistent with what Georgians believed on August 7, in the final hours before the war, when a cease-fire collapsed. "During the height of all of these developments, when I was on the phone with senior Georgian officials, they sure sounded completely convinced that Russian armored vehicles had entered the Roki Tunnel, and exited the Roki Tunnel, before and during the cease-fire," he stated. "I said, under instructions, that we urge you not to engage these Russians directly."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Bryza had also said earlier in August 2008, "They felt they had to defend the honor of their nation and defend their villages. It was a very dangerous dynamic. That was part of an action-reaction, 'Guns of August' scenario that we tried to defuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/16/AR2008081600502_pf.html |title=A Two-Sided Descent Into Full-Scale War |publisher=The Washington Post |date=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} On 18 September 2008, the U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] said: "On August 7th, following repeated violations of the ceasefire in South Ossetia, including the shelling of Georgian villages, the Georgian government launched a major military operation into Tskhinvali and other areas of the separatist region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2008/09/109954.htm |title=Secretary Rice Addresses U.S.-Russia Relations At The German Marshall Fund |date=2008-09-18 |publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Poland}} In September 2008, President [[Lech Kaczyński]] said in an interwiew that Georgia's decision to launch operation against South Ossetia was provoked: "This mistake was provoked. There was a test of strength, and Russia showed the face it wanted to show—an imperial face. Ukraine is now threatened. We won't see the rebirth of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union.

{{flagicon|France}} In late October 2008, French Foreign Minister [[Bernard Kouchner]] in his interview with ''[[Kommersant]]'' said that during the war "there was a real danger of regime change in Georgia". He also said that "...Russia without question was prepared. Russian troops, by some miracle, turned up on the border at the right time." He stated that the next hot spots could become [[Crimea]], [[Ukraine]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1048686 |script-title=ru:Бернар Кушнер: я, наверное, менее дипломатичный и более честный |date=2008-10-28 |publisher=Kommersant|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Georgia}} On 28 October 2008, Brigadier general [[Mamuka Kurashvili]], a Georgian MoD official, testified before the parliamentary commission studying the Russo-Georgian war and said that his remarks on the launch of military operations on August 7, describing it as an effort "to restore constitutional order," were not authorized by superiors and were "impulsive." Kurashvili's interview with a Georgian TV on 7 August was the first statement made by a Georgian official indicating that Tbilisi had launched an operation against the breakaway region. "It [the statement] was not agreed with anybody and I had no instruction from anybody [to make that statement]," Kurashvili told the commission. He added that "I had just come out from the battle when a journalist approached me... I was confused." He also stated that Russian commander Marat Kulakhmetov’s statements made during the early stage of the conflict about his inability to control the South Ossetian militias was a lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=19846 |title=Senior MoD Official Testifies Before War Commission |publisher=Civil.Ge |date=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Georgia}} On 25 November 2008, [[Erosi Kitsmarishvili]], Georgia's former ambassador to Russia, gave a testimony to a parliamentary commission in which he said that Georgian authorities were preparing for the conflict. According to Kitsmarishvili, Georgian officials told him in April 2008 that they planned to start a war in [[Abkhazia]] and that they had received a green light from the United States government to do so. He said that the Georgian government later decided to start the war in South Ossetia and continue into Abkhazia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/world/europe/26georgia.html |title=Ex-Diplomat Says Georgia Started War With Russia |author1=Olesya Vartanyan |author2=Ellen Barry |date=2008-11-25 |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, "Russia was ready for this war, but the Georgian leadership started the military action first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE4AO7SL20081125 |title=Georgia war hearing marred by angry exchanges |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} A report prepared for the British [[House of Lords]] comes to the conclusion that "The precise circumstances surrounding the August 2008 outbreak of the conflict are not yet clear but responsibility for the conflict was shared, in differing measures, by all the parties. There is evidence of a Russian military build-up prior to the August war. In addition, Russia’s use of force was disproportionate in response to provocative statements and military action by President Saakashvili. President Saakashvili seems to have drawn unfounded confidence in confronting Russia as a result of mixed signals from the US Administration. The origins of the conflict lie in both distant and more recent history in the region, involving population transfers, national grievances, commercial, political and military interests."&lt;ref name="Houseoflords"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldeucom/26/26.pdf |title=After Georgia.

{{flagicon|Russia}} In July 2009, [[Alexander Bastrykin]], Chairman of the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor General's Office, told journalists that the investigation of the war was almost complete. However, the guilt of Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili in instigating the conflict in South Ossetia could not be proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2009/07/03_a_3218775.shtml |script-title=ru:Саакашвили остался невиновным |publisher=gazeta.ru |date=2009-07-04|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Europe}} In September 2009, [[Václav Havel]], the first [[List of Presidents of the Czech Republic|president]] of the [[Czech Republic]], and other European politicians and thinkers wrote: "First, a big power will always find or engineer a pretext to invade a neighbour whose independence it resents. We should remember that Hitler accused the Poles of commencing hostilities in 1939, just as Stalin pinned the blame on the Finns when he invaded their country in 1940. Similarly, in the case of Georgia and Russia, the critical question is to determine which country invaded the other, rather than which soldier shot the first bullet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/sep/22/europe-georgia-russia |title=Europe must stand up for Georgia |publisher=The Guardian |date=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} In 2011, [[Condoleezza Rice]], former Secretary of State, told ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' that she was "worried that the Russians would provoke [Georgian president Mikheil] Saakashvili and that he would allow himself to be provoked. But in no way were the Georgians at fault..." She said: "They were doing all kinds of things to try to provoke the Georgians. The shelling of Georgian cities by the South Ossetians, Russian allies, is clearly what started the war." Rice also talked about Russian hatred for Georgians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/condoleeza-rice-blames-putin-war-georgia_609118.html |title=Condoleezza Rice Blames Putin for War with Georgia |date=2011-11-16 |publisher=The Weekly Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Russia}} On 5 August 2012, a new documentary "A Lost Day" (Russian: "Потерянный день") was released on [[YouTube]]. The authors of the documentary were unknown. Several high-ranking military officials were featured. [[Yuri Baluyevsky]], former Chief of the General Staff of Russia said that President Dmitry Medvedev didn't want to make a decision to go to war for some time. Baluyevsky said that it was Putin that had ordered to "retaliate" militarily against Georgia "after the first tensions", however "high-level officials" in Moscow had the fear of responsibility "until a kick in one place from Vladimir Vladimirovich in Beijing followed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/2627181/film_iz_buduschego |script-title=ru:Генералы жестко критикуют Медведева |publisher=[[Vedomosti]] |date=2012-08-08|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baluyevsky said that Putin made a decision to invade Georgia before Medvedev became President in May 2008 and a detailed military plan was worked out and specific orders were issued in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=39746 |title=Putin Confirms the Invasion of Georgia Was Preplanned |publisher=The Jamestown Foundation |date=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Russia}} On 8 August 2012, Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] said that the intense fighting began on 6 August 2008. "The information what was happening at the time of the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th of the (August 2008), I received directly from Tskhinvali. Oddly enough, from journalists.

{{flagicon|South Ossetia}} In August 2012, several South Ossetian officials told ''[[Vzglyad (newspaper)|Vzglyad]]'' that the war began on 1 August.&lt;ref name="vz"/&gt;

{{flagicon|Russia}} In June 2013, Russian president Vladimir Putin said in a television interview that Russia attacked Georgia because the Georgian government was smuggling terrorists across Abkhazia to the Russian border near [[Sochi]]. "About six or seven years ago when we had to attack Georgian territories, those were not just strikes on Georgia. We targeted militant groups that came very close to Sochi. … Georgian police vehicles were transporting the militants to the Russian border. So we had to take some pre-emptive measures. And I informed the president [Dmitry Medvedev] about this," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/putins-fantasies-about-georgian-terrorists/481915.html |title=Putin's Fantasies About Georgian Terrorists |publisher=The Moscow Times |date=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33oIF-ggK5U |title=Putin talks NSA, Syria, Iran, drones in exclusive RT interview (FULL VIDEO) |date=2013-06-12 |publisher=RT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Sweden}} In 2013, sources connected with Swedish intelligence told newspaper ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', that [[National Defence Radio Establishment (Sweden)|Sweden's National Defence Radio Establishment]] (FRA) predicted that war between Russia and George would break out before the US did. "We could see how the Russians moved military units and how things then became silent. That meant everything was in place and that the final preparations for a strike were underway," one of the sources said. The source added: "We knew that Russia would likely enter Georgia. At the same time, the US drew a different conclusion: that there would be no war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5727212 |title=Sweden knew about the Russia-Georgia war before the US: report |publisher=Radio Sweden |date=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} In 2014, Daniel Fata, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO policy in Pentagon from September 2005 to September 2008, said that Putin gave assurances to the United States over Georgia in 2008 that his intervention was limited in scope and designed to protect Russian citizens. But Putin lied, because his intention all along was to bring down the government of President Mikheil Saakashvili. Although Saakashvili was not deposed, his standing was weakened by the war. The United States was concerned about potential Russian aggression in South Ossetia, and was taken by surprise when the Russian military moved instead on Abkhazia. Fata said that the reasons behind Russia's actions is that "Putin wants to be seen as a player," to be "a great power like France, Germany, and the UK".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/03/05/what-russias-invasion-of-georgia-means-for-crimea/ |title=What Russia’s invasion of Georgia means for Crimea |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Ukraine}} In early April 2014, Acting President [[Oleksandr Turchynov]] stated: "This was an exact plan of Putin on the aggression against Ukraine. Crimea was the beginning. [...] They worked out an aggressive, brutal and cynical technology in the Caucasus. [...] Scenario is the same: provocation is organized, local servicemen respond to it and as a result of military confrontation civilians are killed. Dreadful pictures of dead people and children, regular army is sent to protect people. This scenario was prepared for us. [...] That is why Ukrainian servicemen received an order to hold the line within their military bases and on the ships understanding that they will be provoked to kill civilians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://georgia.mfa.gov.ua/en/press-center/news-from-ukraine/784-oleksandr-turchynov-crimea-was-is-and-will-be-ukrainian-land |title=Oleksandr Turchynov: Crimea was, is and will be Ukrainian land! |publisher=Embassy of Ukraine in Georgia |date=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statements by Russian analysts==

{{flagicon|Russia}} In August 2008, [[Pavel Felgenhauer]], a Moscow-based analyst of military affairs, wrote in ''Novaya Gazeta'' that the Russian plan was for the “Ossetians to intentionally provoke the Georgians” so that “any response, harsh or soft, would be used as an occasion for the attack”. He noted that Russia's invasion of Georgia had been planned in advance, with the final political decision to complete the preparations and start the war in August apparently having been made back in April. The war was planned to start no later than the second half of August, because in the following months the weather would deteriorate. The goal of the war was to expel all Georgians from Abkhazia and South Ossetia, to free Tbilisi from Saakashvili, and to force NATO and Americans to abandon the Caucasus region. If the Georgians had not responded to South Ossetian attacks, then Abkhaz separatists would have started the operation to reclaim the Kodori Gorge. But Saakashvili succeeded in destroying the Ossetian militia and Moscow had no other option rather than to confront Georgia itself openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/politics/39134.html |script-title=ru:Это была не спонтанная, а спланированная война | author=Pavel Felgenhauer |publisher=Novaya Gazeta |date=2008-08-14|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/article/20080816/FOREIGN/689163001/-1/ART |title=Georgia invasion 'planned since April' |author=Alan Philps |date=16 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921104535/http://www.thenational.ae/article/20080816/FOREIGN/689163001/-1/ART |archivedate=21 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sunday_Times_17_Aug_09"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4545980.ece | title=The new cold war hots up | publisher=The Sunday Times | date=17 August 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817022835/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4545980.ece |archivedate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felgenhauer also argued in another English-language article that a heavy mortar bombardment of Georgian villages in South Ossetia on 7 August provoked Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to order a major assault. The war was not an improvised Russian reaction to a sudden Georgian military offensive in South Ossetia, and "The invasion was inevitable, no matter what the Georgians did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=33888 |title=THE RUSSIAN-GEORGIAN WAR WAS PREPLANNED IN MOSCOW |date=14 August 2008 |author=Pavel Felgenhauer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, on 7 August, Felgenhauer claimed that while Kokoity and other Ossetian officials seemed to be provoking a major Russian intervention into South Ossetia, not everyone in Moscow was "ready to plunge headlong into war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2373294 |title=OSSETIAN SEPARATISTS ARE PROVOKING A MAJOR RUSSIAN INTERVENTION |date=7 August 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809134226/http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2373294 |archivedate=9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felgenhauer had predicted in June 2008 that Vladimir Putin would start a war against Georgia in Abkhazia and South Ossetia supposedly in late August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apsny.ge/news/1213985330.php |script-title=ru:Россия начнет войну против Грузии предположительно в августе - П.

{{flagicon|Russia}} In August 2008, [[:ru:Гольц, Александр Матвеевич|Aleksandr Golts]], a Moscow-based defense analyst said that the blame laid with the Kremlin.

Satarov claimed that Putin allowed Medvedev to make such mistakes, then later he would [[Impeachment|impeach]] Medvedev and organize a new presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ng.ru/economics/2008-08-29/1_putin.html |script-title=ru:Демонстративное молчание Путина |publisher=Nezavisimaya Gazeta |date=2008-08-29|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Russia}} In October 2008, [[Andrey Illarionov]], former advisor to Vladimir Putin, in his interview with [[Echo of Moscow]] declared that it was suspicious that the evacuation of almost entire South Ossetian population began on 2 August and was finished before the war, because this had not happened before during the past 20 years of the conflict during the escalations of tensions. After the evacuation of the civilian population, the mobilization of volunteers started in the North Caucasus. Illarionov stated that the war is started with the mobilization. On 3 August the volunteers started to arrive in South Ossetia. Illarionov noted that all the volunteers were registered in the Military commissariats of North Caucasus republics and were organized. On 4 August, several Russian special forces were deployed in South Ossetia. Illarionov also noted that since the late July the Ossetian media was reporting that the war was imminent and that Russian [[58th Army (Russia)|58th Army]] would help them. He claimed that on 3 August the third side began to participate in the clashes between the Georgian and South Ossetian forces, firing on both the Georgians and South Ossetians. Illarionov said that the Ossetians do not deny the Georgian reports that on 7 August the Ossetians violated the ceasefire declared by Saakashvili. According to him, by August 2008 South Ossetia had become the most militarised territory per capita in the world, surpassing even North Korea. He also said that the Georgians apparently did not have any plan to invade South Ossetia, only a plan to defend the Georgian villages in South Ossetia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://echo.msk.ru/programs/razvorot/548457-echo/ |script-title=ru:РАЗВОРОТ : СИТУАЦИЯ В ЮЖНОЙ ОСЕТИИ И ГРУЗИИ |publisher=Ekho Moskvy |date=2008-10-24|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Russia}} On 18 November 2008, Russian organisation [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]] said there was abundant evidence that shelling had taken place in the days leading up to August 7 and both sides were involved. The head of Memorial, [[:ru:Орлов, Олег Петрович|Oleg Orlov]], had spent two weeks in South Ossetia and Georgia investigating the conflict. He said that artillery exchanges across the Georgian-South Ossetian border began on August 1, and then "got worse". Orlov said that South Ossetian troops had fired on civilians, including an enclave of ethnic Georgians inside South Ossetia. South Ossetian troops had also fired from the Tskhinvali headquarters of Russian peacekeeping force. Orlov said: "Of course Georgia's armed forces started a full-scale military operation. But the previous politics of Russia provoked Georgia to do this." He added that "But Russian peacekeepers also didn't do their job properly. We know the Russian side gave arms to the Ossetians and that they used them to fire towards Georgia from Russian peacekeeping positions well before August 7."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/18/russia-georgia-war |title=EU asked to pinpoint aggressor in Russia-Georgia war |author=Luke Harding |publisher=The Guardian |date=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/19/georgia-russia-eu-media-inquiry |title=Georgia calls on EU for independent inquiry into war |author=Luke Harding |publisher=The Guardian |date=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Russia}} In November 2008, [[Yulia Latynina]], Russian journalist, asserted that the war started on 7 August, when the Russian forces which were massed on the Georgian border, crossed the Roki tunnel and entered Georgia. She wrote her own analysis of pre-war events for ''EJ''. She quoted in her work Temur Iakobashvili, Georgian minister, as saying that when Saakashvili was informed of the shelling of the Georgian village of Tamarasheni, he ordered no retaliation; however, the information Saakashvili received next, changed everything: that was of 150 Russian tanks moving towards the Roki tunnel. According to Latynina, if Saakashvilil had known that by then Russian 135th and 693rd regiments were already in [[Java (town)|Java]], his reaction would be different. Latynina argues that Saakashvili was faced with not a strategic, but tactical dilemma: selecting not when to clash with the Russians but where - at night in Tskhinvali or at dawn in Gori (well inside Georgia). Latynina stated that Tamarasheni was shelled in order to liberate the road for the Russian tanks, because they couldn't move towards Gori through Tskhinvali via the Zar road. Latynina concluded that Georgia didn't need small-scale clashes with the separatists, because if the Georgians had had military plans for reintegration of South Ossetia, then they would have needed secrecy. But South Ossetia was in need to shell the enemy, like [[Hamas]] or [[Hezbollah]] do. The corrupt ruling regime of South Ossetia needed the war. Latynina noted that while Kokoity and Russia had been preparing to defend from the Georgian attack for 4 years, there was no bomb shelter in the headquarters of Russian peacekeepers. Latynina finally concluded that by the time when Russia formally declared that it had entered the war against Georgia, the Russian 58th army (not the peacekeepers), had already been engaged in military clashes: "It is obvious that [on August 8] at 3 pm Russia decided not to start the war but to acknowledge it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ej.ru/?a=note&amp;id=8589 |title=200 км танков.

{{flagicon|Russia}} In 2009 [[Andrey Illarionov]] in the book 'The Guns of August 2008' authored the chapter ''The Russian Leadership's Preparation for War, 1999-2008''. He wrote that the Russian leadership had taken the decisions that caused the Russo-Georgian war between September 1999 and June 2003. After the appointment of Vladimir Putin in August 1999 as Prime minister, the Russian government changed its attitude towards Georgia. Whatever Saakashvili's government contributions to the deterioration of the Russia-Georgia relations, neither he or his colleagues held positions in the Georgian government before November 2003. Russian authorities had been preparing for the war for nearly a decade. By supplying South Ossetia with heavy military equipment in February 2003, the Russian government chose the military solution to the conflict with Georgia. Mostly the Russian-Abkhaz-South Ossetian coalition made the first moves, to which Georgians responded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Svante E. Cornell |author2=S.

{{flagicon|Russia}} In July 2009, the [[Moscow Defense Brief|Moscow Defence Brief]], a magazine published by [[Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies|CAST]], an independent Russian think-tank,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About CAST |url=http://www.cast.ru/eng/about/|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iYZBfhyX?url=http://www.cast.ru/eng/about/|archivedate=2009-07-26|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that:

{{Quotation|External observers frequently miss the point that Russia’s stake in the conflict over the unrecognized republics is much higher that [sic] that of Georgia’s entry into NATO or the destabilization of energy transit routes that bypass Russia. Russia simply could not afford to lose: in view of the harsh nature of the conflict in Abkhazia and Georgia in the early 1990s, Georgia’s seizure of these territories would mean ethnic cleansing, and the flight to Russian territory of many tens of thousands of embittered and armed refugees. The loyalty of the North Caucasus republics of North Ossetia and Adygeya, tied by blood relation to South Ossetia and Abkhazia, would be undermined. North Ossetia, moreover, is the largest and most loyal autonomous republic in the region. Russia would have been shown to be weak before the entire North Caucasus, and this would have marked a return to the situation of the 1990s. The reaction of the international community to Russia’s war with Georgia, no matter how harsh, could not compare in significance to the implications of a new war in the North Caucasus. Georgia’s attempt to export the ethnic conflict that it created in the early 1990s to Russian territory had to be intercepted at any cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/3-2008/item2/article1/ |title=Conflict in South Ossetia: Political Context |author=Vasily Kashin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002151122/http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/3-2008/item2/article1/ |archivedate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Moscow Defence Brief}}

==Statements by international analysts==

{{flagicon|Germany}} On 8 August 2008, [[Vladimir Socor]], the political analyst of [[Jamestown Foundation]] wrote that the brazen attacks during the night of August 7 to 8 in South Ossetia left the Georgian Government with no choice but to respond. He stated that continuing the restraint policy would have resulted in irreparable human, territorial, and political losses for Georgia. Georgia’s defensive response in South Ossetia since August 8 was "legally within the country’s rights under international law and militarily commensurate with the attacks." NATO’s failure to grant a MAP to Georgia at the April 2008 summit emboldened Russia to escalate military operations against Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bswords%5D=8fd5893941d69d0be3f378576261ae3e&amp;tx_ttnews%5Ball_the_words%5D=Georgia%20Moscow%20proxy&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=33872&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=56f9d06976#.Uz1NVfmSzUg |title=THE GOALS BEHIND MOSCOW’S PROXY OFFENSIVE IN SOUTH OSSETIA |author=Vladimir Socor |publisher=The Jamestown Foundation |date=August 8, 2008 |accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} On 12 August 2008, [[Ralph Peters]] wrote that he was "seeing the emergence of a rogue military power with a nuclear arsenal". Russia made it clear that it would not tolerate freedom and self-rule in its neighbours. Russian air force had been trying unsuccessfully to hit the gas pipeline running from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean. The Kremlin gave a signal to Europe that it not only had the power to turn off Siberian gas, it could turn off every tap in the region any time. Peters wrote: "Any soldier above the grade of private can tell you that there’s absolutely no way Moscow could have launched this huge ground, air and sea offensive in an instantaneous “response” to alleged Georgian actions." Even to get one armored brigade over the Caucasus Mountains needed extensive preparations. Russia (working through its mercenaries in South Ossetia) was staging brutal provocations against Georgia beginning from late July 2008. Peters compared the Russian attack on Georgia to Hitler’s march into Czechoslovakia. The war in Georgia was supposed to be the big debut for the Kremlin’s revitalized armed forces (funded by the new petroleum-generated wealth), but the war unintentionally revealed many of enduring Russian weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2008/08/12/russia-goes-rogue/ |title=RUSSIA GOES ROGUE |author=Ralph Peters |date=2008-08-12 |publisher=[[New York Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} On 13 August 2008, [[George Friedman]], US military analyst, and a [[CEO]] of a US-based think-tank [[Stratfor]], wrote in the institution's report: "There had been a great deal of shelling by the South Ossetians of Georgian villages for the previous three nights, but while possibly more intense than usual, artillery exchanges were routine. [...] It is very difficult to imagine that the Georgians launched their attack against U.S. wishes. The Georgians rely on the United States, and they were in no position to defy it. [...] the United States either was unaware of the existence of Russian forces, or knew of the Russian forces but -- along with the Georgians -- miscalculated Russia's intentions. [...] Putin did not want to re-establish the Soviet Union, but he did want to re-establish the Russian sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union region. [...] He did not want to confront NATO directly, but he did want to confront and defeat a power that was closely aligned with the United States, had U.S. support, aid and advisers and was widely seen as being under American protection. Georgia was the perfect choice. [...] The war in Georgia, therefore, is Russia's public return to great power status. This is not something that just happened — it has been unfolding ever since Putin took power, and with growing intensity in the past five years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/russo_georgian_war_and_balance_power |title=The Russo-Georgian War and the Balance of Power |date=2008-08-12 |publisher=[[Stratfor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} On 14 August 2008, ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote that the war in South Ossetia may have been triggered by the Georgians, but it was largely engineered by the Russians, who had over the years fanned the flames of the conflict. Russian response was not sudden response to provocation, but a long-planned move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/11920701 |title=The war in Georgia: Russia resurgent |publisher=The Economist |date=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia was also prepared for the war ideologically. Its campaign was crude, yet effective. While Russian forces were dropping bombs on Georgia, Moscow "bombarded" its own population with an "astonishing" (even by Soviet standards) propaganda campaign. After Putin’s arrival in the Kremlin in 2000, Russia started to distribute its passports to Abkhaz and South Ossetians, while also claiming the role of a neutral peacekeeper. When the fighting broke out in August 2008 in Georgia, Russia argued that it had to defend its nationals, while it had killed tens of thousands of its own citizens in [[Chechnya]]. In the process of portraying Georgia as a "fascist" country, Russia displayed the syndrome it was condemning. [[Vladimir Putin]] won militarily, but all Russia got from its victory was a shattered reputation, broken ties with Georgia, control over the separatist regions (which it already had) and fear from other former Soviet republics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/11920992 |title=Russia and Georgia: A scripted war |date=2008-08-14 |publisher=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} In August 2008, Steven Blank, a professor of strategic studies at the U.S. Army War College, said that "This is a war that Russia wanted, and clearly had planned for." "The evidence I’ve seen indicates that the Russian Army was sitting there waiting for this, that this was essentially a provocation launched by the South Ossetians, who ratcheted up the level of violence in order to bring the Georgians -- who are easily provokable, obviously -- to attack," he said. "And the Russians were waiting there, ready with an operational plan and with forces in place -- land, sea and air -- to do what they have subsequently done."&lt;ref name="golts_blank"/&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} On 16 August 2008, journalist [https://web.archive.org/web/20140901115716/http://www.macmillanspeakers.com/thomshanker Thom Shanker] wrote that Russian coordination of ground, joint air and naval operations, cyberattacks on Georgian government Web sites and its best English speakers conducting public-relations campaign did not look accidental to military professionals. "They seem to have harnessed all their instruments of national power — military, diplomatic, information — in a very disciplined way," one Pentagon official was quoted as saying. "It appears this was well thought out and planned in advance, and suggests a level of coordination in the Russian government between the military and the other civilian agencies and departments that we are striving for today." A major Russian ground exercise held in July near the Georgian border, called Caucasus 2008, played out a chain of events like the one carried out in the August war. More than 1,000 American military personnel were in Georgia for an exercise in July. But that exercise prepared a Georgian brigade for duty in [[Iraq]], a different mission from the seizing of territory or countering an aggressor. Shanker noted that Russia had reinforced its peacekeeping force in Abkhazia with advanced artillery in April, and in May it sent troops to fix a railroad line linking Abkhazia with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/world/europe/17military.html |title=Russians Melded Old-School Blitz With Modern Military Tactics |date=2008-08-16 |author=Thom Shanker |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Germany}} In August 2008, [[:de:Alexander Rahr|Alexander Rahr]], Russia expert and a Putin biographer, said that "The war in Georgia has put the European order in question," and "The times are past when you can punish Russia."&lt;ref name="traynor"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/16/georgia.russia1 |title=Six days that broke one country - and reshaped the world order |author=Ian Traynor |publisher=The Guardian |date=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} On 16 August 2008, Ian Traynor wrote for ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the war in Georgia was "the biggest victory in eight years of what might be termed Putinism". In pursuit of avenging a long period of Russian humiliation and deploying his limited range of levers to make the world to listen to the Kremlin, the Russian prime minister managed to redraw the geopolitical map. Rather than being the culmination of [[Putinism]], the Russian invasion of Georgia was perceived as the start of something else.&lt;ref name="traynor"/&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} On 25 August 2008, journalist [[Matthew Continetti]] argued that whatever were the precise sequence of pre-war events, however Saakashvili did nothing to provide a reason for Putin to invade Georgia proper; or to bomb targets inside Georgia in the days after the initial ceasefire; or to blame Saakashvili with crimes against humanity; or to attempt regime change in a democratic country that abided by international norms. Continetti also denied the claim that the ultimate blame for this conflict laid with the United States and its NATO and EU allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/425nxbsv.asp?page=2 |title=Blaming the Victim |date=2008-08-25 |author=Matthew Continetti |publisher=The Weekly Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} On 26 August 2008, ''[[Financial Times]]'' wrote that "Most accounts agree that it was South Ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a Georgian military vehicle on August 1, wounding five Georgian peacekeeping troops." It argued: "So swift was the Russian reaction that some analysts believe that, while it did not appear to precede the Georgian assault on Tskhinvali, as Mr Saakashvili claims, it may have been planned in advance, with Mr Saakashvili simply falling into a well prepared Russian trap."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/af25400a-739d-11dd-8a66-0000779fd18c,dwp_uuid=f2b40164-cfea-11dc-9309-0000779fd2ac.html |title=Countdown in the Caucasus: Seven days that brought Russia and Georgia to war |publisher=[[Financial Times]] |date=26 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920023223/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/af25400a-739d-11dd-8a66-0000779fd18c%2Cdwp_uuid%3Df2b40164-cfea-11dc-9309-0000779fd2ac.html |archivedate=20 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} On 26 August 2008, [[Michael Totten]] published the report which contained an interview with an expert Patrick Worms who worked in Tbilisi. Worms's version of events was confirmed by an academic [[Thomas Goltz]]. Worms said: "The Ossetians start provoking and provoking and provoking by shelling Georgian positions and Georgian villages around there. And it's a classic tit for tat thing. You shell, I shell back. The Georgians offered repeated ceasefires, which the Ossetians broke. (...) On the 6th of August the shelling intensifies from Ossetian positions. And for the first time since the war finished in 1992, they are using 120mm guns. (...) Because of the peace agreement they had, nobody was allowed to have guns bigger than 80mm. Okay, so that's the formal start of the war. It wasn't the attack on Tskhinvali."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaeltotten.com/archives/2008/08/the-truth-about-1.php |title=The Truth About Russia in Georgia |date=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} In August 2008, Peter Roudik, Senior Foreign Law Specialist working for the [[Library of Congress]], criticized Russian claim that the Georgian attack on the South Ossetian town of Tskhinvali was "an act of aggression" and Russia’s involvement was an act of assistance in defence against the attacking Georgian troops, saying that an act of aggression can be recognized only by the U.N. Security Council upon evaluation of the circumstances surrounding the military actions. He pointed out that an act of aggression requires use of the armed forces against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of another state. South Ossetia remained an integral part of Georgia on 8 August 2008, which excluded the possibility of Georgian aggression against South Ossetia and undermined the use of this justification for Russia’s action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/russian-georgia-war.php |title=Russian Federation: Legal Aspects of War in Georgia |author=Peter Roudik |publisher=Library of Congress |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716042951/http://www.loc.gov/law/help/russian-georgia-war.php |archivedate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper pointed out that its assertions were "initial conclusions," and because of the recent nature of the event, the information might possibly need correction as more solid evidence arrived.&lt;ref name=isdp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/silkroadpapers/0808Georgia-PP.pdf |format=PDF |author1=Svante E.

{{flagicon|Ukraine}} In November 2008, Oleksandr Sushko, deputy director of Center for Peace, Conversion and Foreign Policy of Ukraine, argued: "Russian invasion in Georgia on 08.08.08 changed dramatically security environment in the Eastern Europe by the evident destruction of an international order based on multilateral consensus achieved back in 1991, at the collapse of the USSR." In 2008 Georgia, the country belonging, as viewed by Russia, to the sphere of its "privileged interests" passed over the informal limit of sovereignty imposed by Russia and therefore was punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pl.boell.org/sites/default/files/uploads/2014/02/georgia_war_from_ua_perspective_by_o.sushko.pdf |title=The end of "International order –1991": Impact of 2008 Russia-Georgia war on Ukraine |author=Oleksandr Sushko |date=November 2008 |publisher=Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung Warszawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} In 2008, [http://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/people/Allison.html Roy Allison], wrote in [[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]] that there is strong evidence that the Russian invasion of South Ossetia and then deeper into Georgia was planned and expected rather than spontaneous and improvised. However, the exact timing of the intervention during August–September "may not have been of Moscow’s choosing", if for example South Ossetian forces were impatient to instigate a conflict in July–August to give Russia a pretext for intervention and could not be effectively controlled. Regarding the events of August 7/8, Allison states that "Moscow’s insistence that its forces did not cross the Georgian border until Russian peacekeepers in Tskhinvali were in severe jeopardy has gained quite wide acceptance internationally. The Georgian claim has, however, been strengthened by the release of telephone intercepts (lost for a month in the chaos of combat) indicating that at least part of a Russian armoured regiment had crossed into South Ossetia by late on 7 August." In the light of the Russian occupation of uncontested Georgian territory, Russian claim to realise the peacekeeping function assumed in the Sochi agreements is described as "increasingly surreal". He noted that "international agreements limited Russia’s peacekeeping role in South Ossetia to monitoring the ceasefire, with no provision for peace enforcement". Russia's goals in the war are described as manyfold: Restoring the security of its peacekeepers and 'citizens' in South Ossetia, the establishment of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as military protectorates, a weakening of Georgia's strategic position (as a means to dissuade NATO from offering a [[Membership Action Plan|MAP]] to Georgia and to diminish the attractiveness of the energy transit corridor from the Caspian) and bringing down the government of President Saakashvili.&lt;ref name="Allison"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roy Allison |url=http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/files/12445_84_6allison.pdf |title=Russia resurgent?

{{flagicon|United States}} In 2008, Professor of Political Science [[Robert Freedman (political scientist)|Robert O. Freedman]] argued that the policy demonstrated by Vladimir Putin in his invasion of Georgia "should have come as no surprise to anyone following Putin's foreign policy in the Middle East in the 2005-2008 period, which has clearly displayed the aggressiveness and anti-Americanism so evident in the invasion of Georgia." Putin's support of the anti-American terrorist organizations and rogue states "set the stage for the invasion of Georgia as Putin sought to spread Russian influence throughout the South Caucasus as well as the Middle East." Putin offered Russian citizenship to people living in the separatist regions, and encouraged the South Ossetians to periodically fire artillery shells at Georgian positions outside of South Ossetia, forcing Saakashvili into a military response against the region, thus providing a pretext for Russian military to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cria-online.org/5_2.html |title=The Russian Invasion of Georgia – Its Impact on Israel and the Middle East |publisher=CRIA |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Bangladesh}} In July 2009, [https://chittagong.academia.edu/MohammadSajjadurRahman Mohammad Sajjadur Rahman] noted that the decisive military move by Russia was the first since the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]]. The role played by Russia in the 1990s in overseeing the peace process transformed the separatist conflicts into a dispute between Georgia and Russia. Putin's desire to elevate Russia’s Great Power image was "an important indicator of the motivations that guided the decision to engage in war with Georgia." Rahman argued that "Realism, the most dominant theory of International Relations, can be applied in analyzing Russian behavior in this war." Rahman denied the claim that Russia’s action was defensive and retaliatory, explaining that long before the war, Russia had established the infrastructure and logistical support for a military invasion. Putin’s decision to engage in a war with Georgia was guided by geopolitical interests that Russia sought to advance through a decisive victory. The conflict would act as a deterrent against building any new pipelines from Azerbaijan to Turkey across Georgia. However, the war exposed Russia’s inability to accomplish political objectives without violence. Rahman argued that "Russia’s negligence of the international organizations during the war also indicates the realist worldview of the Kremlin that Russia will act on its own if its interests clash with the desires of the international community." He argued that "both Putin and Saakashvili used identity politics and provoked ethnic/nationalist tensions that led to the outbreak of the war." After the war, Putin became more popular and he was "certainly very much in charge of his country, [...] more than ever." Rahman summarized that "the causes of the August war were indeed complex and multifaceted." The failure of the West to deescalate the tension also contributed to the outbreak of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.codesria.org/IMG/pdf/7-_What_Caused_the_August_War__Mohammad_Sajjadur_Rahman_March_31_2009.pdf |title=Georgia and Russia: What Caused the August War? |author=Mohammad Sajjadur Rahman |journal=Identity, Culture &amp; Politics: An Afro-Asian Dialogue |volume=10 |number=1 |pages=132–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Austria}} In 2009, [[:de:Martin Malek|Martin Malek]], a researcher at the Institute for Peace Support and Conflict Management of the National Defense Academy in [[Vienna]], noted that in September 2008 Russian Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] at the [[Valdai International Discussion Club]] told his audience about his meeting with Chinese officials on the day of the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in [[Beijing]], where he recognised China’s problem with [[Taiwan]] and therefore did not press China to recognise the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia; Malek concluded that Putin considered the recognition of the independence of Georgia’s separatist regions, at the latest, on 8 August. Malek also wrote that Russia's aim was to prevent Georgia’s restoration of its territorial integrity, humiliate Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, intimidate the Georgian nation and damage Georgia’s economy and civilian infrastructure, thus undermining its relevance as a gas and oil transit country. Furthermore, Russia's intention was to send a strong signal to the US, NATO and the EU with the subtext not to "meddle in" the areas belonging to the former Soviet Union, because the Kremlin officially considers them as "zone of vital interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cria-online.org/7_10.html |title=Georgia &amp; Russia: The "Unknown" Prelude To The "Five Day War" |author=Martin Malek |journal=[[Caucasian Review of International Affairs]] |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=227–232 |date=Spring 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?ots591=0c54e3b3-1e9c-be1e-2c24-a6a8c7060233&amp;lng=en&amp;id=103195 |title=Georgia &amp; Russia: The 'Unknown' Prelude to the 'Five Day War' |author=Martin Malek |journal=[[Caucasian Review of International Affairs]] |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=227–232 |date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Estonia}} In 2009, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140729012843/http://icds.ee/index.php?id=59&amp;L=1 Kaarel Kaas] wrote an article for International Centre for Defense Studies, where he noted that this war was the first time after the fall of the Soviet Union that modern Russia used military force against another sovereign country. The war in Georgia in August sent a clear signal to the world: when necessary, Russia will engage in full-scale conventional warfare against other countries in order to pursue its political interests. The military operation was only one of the phases in a longer-term anti-Georgian campaign. The staffs concerned must have planned the war for months – they had to develop an overall operations plan, to move in the stocks necessary for the battle, to allocate the aviation resources for the deployment of troops to Georgia and other logistic capabilities, to produce a target list for the air force, and so on. The scope and intensity of Russian attack exceeded the forecasts made by the Georgian leadership and the Western countries. The Russians achieved a strategic advantage by using the element of surprise. He pointed out that most of the units deployed against Georgia were from the North Caucasus Military District, whose military capabilities are the greatest in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icds.ee/publications/article/the-russian-bear-on-the-warpath-against-georgia/ |title=The Russian Bear on the Warpath Against Georgia |author=Kaarel Kaas |publisher=International Centre for Defense Studies | date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} In 2009, [[United States Army|US Army]] [http://www.dodlive.mil/files/2010/05/Biography-COL-Donovan-28-APR-10.pdf Colonel George T. Donovan, Jr.] wrote that Russia's strategic objectives in the August War could be divided into two categories. The first category included the objectives that did not relate directly to planning a military campaign. With these objectives, Russia wanted to send a strong signal to the West that Russia returned to the world as powerful player, and was willing and able to use military force to protect its interests. A strong message was sent to Ukraine as well as other post-Soviet states with ethnic Russian populations that Russia would take steps to protect them and could use them as a means for expanding its influence and control in the region. The second category included those objectives that pertained directly to operational art since they articulated military requirements for the war. First, Russia wanted to gain control of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Second, Russia aimed to "demonstrate the tenuous authority of the Georgian government as well as Georgia’s economic dependence on Russian cooperation" by humiliating Georgian government through a war and demonstrating that Russia could interdict Georgia’s economy at will. Third, Russia aimed to destroy Georgian armed forces in order to eliminate the threat to the two breakaway regions. The Russian military was likely given some restrictions for the use of force so as not to overly provoke the international community. The Russians acknowledged that a prolonged occupation of Georgia proper would cause a guerilla war; however the Russians did not want to face such a war, because they had already experienced one in [[Chechnya]]. Donovan dismissed the assertions that Georgian army should have fought better because it had American equipment and training, explaining that the Georgian military was trained for a different type of war, a counter-insurgency in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a500627.pdf |title=Russian Operational Art in the Russo-Georgian War Of 2008 |author=Colonel George T. Donovan, Jr. |publisher=U.S. Army War College |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} In 2009, [http://www.american.edu/sis/faculty/tserete.cfm Dr. Mamuka Tsereteli] argued that "The Russian invasion of Georgia established new strategic realities in Eastern Europe and Central Eurasia." The war was the culmination of Russia’s comeback in Eastern European and Eurasian affairs that occurred "in response to high energy prices, a weak US strategic position, European division and uncertainty in Turkey’s strategies." It made clear that Russia was willing to use force for its interests, while western powers were not, and this "was predictable, but not certain to some." The war in Georgia also indicated that "even NATO members may not be fully protected by their commitment to that organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Full_Mamuka_RussiaGeorgia.pdf |title=The Impact of the Russia-Georgia War on the South Caucasus Transportation Corridor |author=Mamuka Tsereteli |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820183644/http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Full_Mamuka_RussiaGeorgia.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} In 2010, [[Janusz Bugajski]] argued that Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev were convinced that the West needed Russia much more than Russia needed the West and calculated several advantages could be achieved by attacking Georgia. Although Russia failed to achieve the main goal of overthrowing the Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, the Kremlin could manufacture another pretext for a new invasion such as claiming that Georgia is a transit route for Islamic terrorists or is rearming for a new war with Abkhazia and South Ossetia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csis.org/files/publication/102110_Bugajski_GeorgianLessons.WEB.pdf |title=Georgian Lessons |publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies |date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} In 2011, Dr. [[Ariel Cohen]] and [http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/people.cfm?authorID=827 Colonel Robert E. Hamilton] argued that Russia launched the war against Georgia for geopolitical objectives, which included de facto annexation of Abkhazia, weakening or toppling the Saakashvili government and preventing NATO enlargement. Moscow prepared over 2 and half years for a combined-operations-style invasion of Georgia. The Vladimir Putin-Dmitry Medvedev administration sent a strong signal to Ukraine that the goal of NATO membership may result in dismemberment and a military invasion. The protection of Russian citizens residing in a neighbouring states would lead to a redrawing of the former Soviet borders, including in the Crimea (Ukraine), and possibly in Northern Kazakhstan. If a pro-Russian regime were established in Georgia, it would bring the strategic [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline]] and the [[South Caucasus Pipeline|Baku-Erzurum gas pipeline]] under Russian control. The Russian use of pro-Russian separatist proxies to undermine Georgia's independence is not unlike [[Iran]]'s use of Hezbollah and Hamas in [[Levant]]. Cohen and Hamilton concluded that the Russian leadership focused on Georgia as the key element in its strategy to reassert Russian domination in [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=1069 |title=The Russian Military and the Georgia War: Lessons and Implications |author1=Dr. Ariel Cohen |author2=Colonel Robert E. Hamilton |date=2011-06-09 |publisher=Strategic Studies Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} In 2012, Ariel Cohen argued: "It seems clear that Russia had been preparing for this war for years, and deliberately provoked Georgia through the shooting and shelling of Georgian-controlled villages in South Ossetia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.turkishpolicy.com/dosyalar/files/The_Geopolitical_Scene_of_the_Caucasus_A_Decade_of_Perspectives.pdf |title=Azerbaijan and U.S. Interests in the South Caucasus: Twenty Years after Independence |author=Ariel Cohen |journal=The Geopolitical Scene of the Caucasus: A Decade of Perspectives |publisher=Toplumsal Katılım ve Gelişim Vakfı |date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} In 2012, [https://web.archive.org/web/20141102132703/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/intrel/people/index.php/rf2.html Rick Fawn] and [https://usu.academia.edu/RobertNalbandov Robert Nalbandov] wrote that the precise timing of events on the night of 7–8 August 2008 was a substantial study in itself, and depended on "all of the inputs being provable." None of the sides of the conflict saw the events of 7–8 August in isolation, nor presented them as isolated. How those events were interconnected "is essential to determining the story." Fawn and Nalbandov paid attention to the report that during the large-scale military exercise "Kavkaz 2008" in the North Caucasus, which concluded on 4 August, a written notice entitled "Soldier, know your probable enemy" was circulated among the Russian participants; The notice then clarified the enemy as Georgia.
Fawn and Nalbandov argued: "The Russian military measures were part of a Russian strategy and possibly a genuine belief that Moscow was acting in accordance with, and upholding, international law and norms." Fawn and Nalbandov also argued that different events, and different interlinkages, created the story. Every event was used by the sides rhetorically as the "start", which justified retaliation. "An essential characteristic of the conflict in South Ossetia was that, notwithstanding the presence of the Joint Control Commission’s forces as peacekeepers in the conflict zone, each military clash led to mutual blame by the belligerent parties: each side accused the other of opening the first salvo and characterized its actions only as a response." According to Fawn and Nalbandov, "one starting point" for deterioration of the situation in South Ossetia was 7 July when four Georgian officers were seized by South Ossetian authorities. The researchers concluded that "The August war did not come out of nowhere," and "The precise ignition of the war rests on specific timing in the late hours of 7 August and early hours of 8 August, and when and why Russian armor traveled through the Roki tunnel from the Russian Federation into Georgia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09662839.2012.656601 |title=The difficulties of knowing the start of war in the information age: Russia, Georgia and the War over South Ossetia, August 2008 |author1=Rick Fawn |author2=Robert Nalbandov |journal=European Security |volume=21 |issue=1 |year=2012 |doi=10.1080/09662839.2012.656601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/1471095/The_difficulties_of_knowing_the_start_of_war_in_the_information_age_Russia_Georgia_and_the_War_over_South_Ossetia_August_2008 |title=The difficulties of knowing the start of war in the information age: Russia, Georgia and the War over South Ossetia, August 2008 |author1=Rick Fawn |author2=Robert Nalbandov |date=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} In August 2012, Scott C. Monje, senior editor of the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', argued: "Thus, provocations and incidents had become commonplace over the course of several years, and they frequently occurred in the summer. These generally produced an annual spike in tensions but not open warfare. Some of the events of 2008 were initially seen as repeating the pattern, but this time the consequences were different. [...] Then, on August 6 and 7, South Ossetian militias opened fire with heavy artillery on Georgian villages within the territory." Vladimir Putin's 2012 statement that Russia was prepared for the war and the planning involved South Ossetian militias and that the war began on 6 August (when the militias attacked Georgian villages), suggested that these attacks were part of the plan as a provocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2012/08/20/the-return-of-the-russian-georgian-war/ |title=The Return of the Russian-Georgian War |publisher=Foreign Policy Association |date=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Estonia}} In 2013, Lieutenant colonel [[:et:Riho Ühtegi|Riho Ühtegi]] wrote: "If the Russian side had the intention to bring Georgia to its knees, then it thought the goal had been achieved. Alas, this time it was Russia which was wrong – the military victory did not translate into a political one." He also argued that the war "has drawn unjustifiably little attention in the military analysts’ community, even though it was one of the most genuine lessons in conventional warfare of the past twenty years, has busted quite a few myths and dogmas, and not just from a political perspective, but also in terms of military aspects." He admitted "that to this day it is relatively difficult to obtain information about what really happened at any given moment in 2008." Ühtegi asserted that "even in June 2008 all the signs showed that even if war were to erupt, it would happen in Abkhazia." However the circumstances changed in June 2008, because on the border of South Ossetia skirmishes became more frequent and the Ossetians attacked the Georgian villages in South Ossetia, which was met with Georgian mortar fire. Ühtegi stated "considering the complicated situation in South Caucasus in the summer of 2008, it is difficult to say exactly who started the war. In fact – we should first agree upon how we define starting a war." He agreed with the opinion that "Russian side or rather the Ossetians with support from the Russian forces conducted a multitude of provocations during the summer of 2008, which led to the war." The Russian analysts assessed the international situation adequately and calculated that should Georgia send its regular forces to South Ossetia and should Russia react with a military counterstrike, it would not cause a war between great powers, because first there would be a dispute as to who the aggressor was – Russia or Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diplomaatia.ee/en/article/the-2008-russia-georgia-war-five-years-later/ |title=The 2008 Russia-Georgia War five years later |year=2013 |publisher=Diplomaatia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Netherlands}} In early 2014, [http://www.cicerofoundation.org/about/index.php Marcel H. Van Herpen], director of the Cicero Foundation, published the book ''Putin's Wars: The Rise of Russia's New Imperialism'' that offered the first systematic analysis of the war in the wider historical context. Van Herpen suggested that although the official Russian narrative (that the war started with a Georgian "surprise" attack on Tskhinvali) became widely accepted, this was not true. The war's history began in 2000. Russian plans to annex Abkhazia already existed in the 1990s. 7–12 August 2008 was the third phase of the war. Illegal incursion of the troops from Russia into South Ossetia before the Georgian military operation began on 7 August, constituted a ''casus belli''. Because of the Russian propaganda, the victim (Georgia) became the aggressor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marcel H. Van Herpen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7tCjAwAAQBAJ |title=Putin's Wars: The Rise of Russia's New Imperialism |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Herpen finished writing the book in late 2013, and predicted "if Ukraine were to opt for deeper integration into the European Union, a Georgia scenario could not be excluded, in which the Kremlin could provoke riots in Eastern Ukraine or the Crimea, where many Russian passport holders live," and could provide the Kremlin with a pretext to intervene and "dismember the country" since Russia would be defending the "Russians" living there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-ir.info/2014/08/05/review-putins-wars-the-rise-of-russias-new-imperialism/ |title=Review – Putin’s Wars: The Rise of Russia’s New Imperialism |date=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|United States}} In April 2014, [http://csis.org/expert/jeffrey-mankoff Jeffrey Mankoff] argued: "Saakashvili sought to bring Georgia into NATO and recover both breakaway republics. In response, Moscow encouraged South Ossetian forces to carry out a series of provocations, eventually triggering, in 2008, a Georgian military response and giving Russia a pretext to invade Georgia and formally recognize Abkhazian and South Ossetian independence. [...] Pledges to defend threatened Russian or other minority populations outside Russia may play well domestically, but it was the Azerbaijani, Georgian, and Moldovan governments’ desire to escape Russia’s geopolitical orbit—more than their real or alleged persecution of minorities—that led Moscow to move in. Russia has never intervened militarily to defend ethnic minorities, including Russians, in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, who have often suffered much more than their co-ethnics in other former Soviet republics, probably because Moscow doesn’t assign the same strategic significance to those Central Asian countries, where Western influence has been limited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csis.org/publication/russias-latest-land-grab-how-putin-won-crimea-and-lost-ukraine |title=Russia’s Latest Land Grab: How Putin Won Crimea and Lost Ukraine |publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies |date=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Romanian National Opera, Timișoara''' ({{lang-ro|Opera Națională Română din Timișoara}}) is a public opera and [[ballet company|ballet]] institution in [[Timișoara]], Romania. It is one of the national opera companies of [[Romania]]. The Opera shares the same building with the Mihai Eminescu National Theatre in Timișoara.

The first performance at the Timișoara Opera was on 27 April 1875, the inaugural concert being [[Aida]] by G. Verdi.&lt;ref name="ort"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ort.ro/ro/istoric|title=Istoric &amp;#124; Opera Romana Timișoara|publisher=ort.ro|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 20, 1880 the building is devastated by the first fire. The theatre goes bankrupt and it is bought by the authorities, in charge of its recovery. Since investments were insufficient individual funds were needed. The government offered "eternal" property over twenty lodges and the right of inheritance. Later, in agreement with the owners, they are redeemed. The reconstruction, completed in 1882, keeps the original Renaissance style of the façade.

After the second fire, which takes place in 1920, only the lateral wings remain intact. The reconstruction of the building begins on July 15, 1923, by architect [[Duiliu Marcu]].

On December 20, 1989, during the [[Romanian Revolution]], a crowd of 40,000 gathered in the open space in front of the opera house. Some managed to enter the building through the rear, and a succession of figures representing factories and ethnic groups delivered speeches from the balcony. From that point, the revolutionaries controlled the opera and surrounding square, although representatives of the [[Ceaușescu]] regime briefly continued to hold the county council building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Siani-Davies|title = The Romanian Revolution of December 1989 |location = Ithaca, NY|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2007|isbn=0-801-47389-6|pages=74–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work''''' is a 2006 non-fiction book by [[Industrial and organizational psychology|industrial psychologist]] Paul Babiak and [[Criminal psychology|criminal psychologist]] [[Robert D. Hare]]. 

==Contents summary==
The text covers the nature of psychopaths in the context of employment and purports to explain: how psychopaths [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] their way into work and get promoted, the effects of their presence on colleagues and [[corporation]]s, and the superficial similarities (and fundamental differences) between [[leadership]] skills and psychopathic traits. The work is interlaced with fictional [[narratives]] illustrating how the factual content applies to real-life situations. Characteristics of manipulators are described as shifting to meet stereotypical gender expectations: a female psychopath might make full use of the passive, warm, nurturing, and dependent [[sex-role]] stereotype in order to get what she wants out of others and a male psychopath might use a [[Machismo|macho]] image, intimidation, and aggression to achieve satisfaction of his desires. The authors posit that around 1% of senior positions in business are psychopaths.

The authors describe a "five phase model" of how a typical [[workplace psychopath]] climbs to and maintains power: entry, assessment, manipulation, confrontation, and ascension. In the entry stage, the psychopath will use highly developed [[social skills]] and [[Superficial charm|charm]] to obtain employment into an organisation. At this stage it will be difficult to spot anything which is indicative of psychopathic behaviour, and as a new employee you might perceive the psychopath to be helpful and even benevolent. Once on to the assessment stage, the psychopath will weigh you up according to your usefulness, and you could be recognised as either a pawn (who has some informal [[Social influence|influence]] and will be easily manipulated) or a [[Patronage|patron]] (who has formal power and will be used by the psychopath to protect against attacks).

[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]] involves the psychopath creating a scenario of “[[Cognitive distortion|psychopathic fiction]]” where positive information about themselves and negative [[disinformation]] about others will be created, where your role as a part of a network of [[Flying monkeys (psychology)|pawns or patrons]] will be utilised and you will be [[Operant conditioning|groomed]] into accepting the psychopath's agenda. Once on to the confrontation stage, the psychopath will use techniques of [[character assassination]] to maintain their agenda, and you will be either discarded as a pawn or used as a patron. Finally, in the ascension stage, the role of the subject as a patron in the psychopath’s quest for power will be discarded, and the psychopath will take for himself/herself a position of power and prestige from anyone who once supported them.

The '''Societaetstheater''' is the oldest popular theatre in [[Dresden]], Germany. Founded in 1776 as an amateur theatre by a society of friends from both the nobility and the middle class, it was initially respected and influential but declined in the early 19th century after the fashion shifted to elaborate historical and verse dramas and the national theatre movement grew in importance, and was eventually dissolved in 1832. The [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] building on Hauptstraße in the [[Innere Neustadt (Dresden)|Innere Neustadt]] was abandoned for many years in the second half of the 20th century, but beginning in 1979, a movement grew to restore it. The theatre reopened in 1999 and is now operated by the city.

==History==
===Foundation and heyday===
[[File:Societaetstheater Dresden Schlussstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Keystone over the theatre entrance, by Jürgen Mehlhorn, 1979]]
After the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, the theatrical landscape in Dresden shifted, with French actors being replaced by German, "partly to save money, partly out of patriotism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iffland |first=August Wilhelm |editor-last=Košenina |editor-first=Alexander |title=Beiträge zur Schauspielkunst: Briefe über die Schauspielkunst; Fragmente über Menschendarstellung auf den deutschen Bühnen |series=Theatertexte |volume=20 |location=Hanover |publisher=Wehrhahn |year=2009 |isbn=9783865251213 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=WoOgU_6CKIXooATeg4CYCg&amp;id=FbAsAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Iffland%2C+theils+aus+Oekonomie%2C+theils+aus+Patriotismus&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=theils+aus+Oekonomie%2C+theils+aus+Patriotismus |page=33 |quotation=theils aus Oekonomie, theils aus Patriotismus }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Reformed" theatre groups such as that of [[Abel Seyler]] gained in respect against the court theatre, which was felt to be too focussed on spectacle, and the educated middle class began to emulate the amateur theatre of the aristocracy. 

On 19 May 1776, a group of fifteen friends founded a society for the purpose of creating a private theatre in their leisure time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vom Societäts-Theater in Dresden |work=Theater-Kalender auf das Jahr 1785 |location=Gotha |year=1785 |pages=83&amp;ndash;84 |quotation=[eine] Gesellschaft längst verbundner Freunde, [die] bey gleichem Geschmacke an Kunst, und bey ähnlichen Trieben zur geselligen Freude&amp;nbsp;... mit vereinten Kräften an [der] Errichtung einer Privatbühne arbeiteten. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hübler2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hübler |first=Jan |title=Dresden: 66 Lieblingsplätze und 11 Erlebnistouren |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRBzSQo8w30C&amp;pg=PA91 |year=2012 |location=Meßkirch |publisher=Gmeiner |language=German |isbn=3-8392-3891-9 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gruber |first=Eckhard |contribution=Sittlicher Bürger Abendschule.

V. |volume=22 |issue=79.3 |year=2004 |page=17 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Societaetstheater was ceremoniously opened the same day, initially in a temporary home near the current location of the [[Dresden Hauptbahnhof|main station]] with a capacity of approximately 50 spectators. 

In 1777, with the assistance of the publisher Conrad Georg Walter, the theatre moved to a larger building in Borngasse (near the current location of the [[German Hygiene Museum]]), but after Walter's death the following year, it moved again on 7 December 1779 to its current home, a garden building in the courtyard behind the residence of the government secretary Johann Christoph Hoffmann at Hauptstraße 19.&lt;ref name=Neustadt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dresden-neustadt.de/archiv/themen/societaetstheater/inhalt.htm |title=Junges Theater mit alter Tradition |publisher=Dresden Neustadt Online |date=26 March 2004 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; This had been built in 1740 in [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, intended for masquerades, but never used. It accommodated an audience of 250 and a 24-piece orchestra.&lt;ref name=86f&gt;"Vom Societäts-Theater in Dresden". pp. 86&amp;ndash;87.&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|6|x|5|m|ft}} stage was small even then; it was illuminated with wax or tallow candles in special holders designed to reflect the light on the desired spot.&lt;ref name="Hübler2012"/&gt; The interior was by [[Johann Ludwig Giesel]], who also designed the interior of the original [[Gewandhaus]] in Leipzig. The design for the curtain in 1779 was by [[Johann Eleazar Zeissig]], known as Schenau, a director of the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]]; it depicted, amongst genii and garlands of roses, scenes from Greek mythology, such as [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]], the [[muse]] of comedy, showing a youth the way to the temple of virtue while a [[maenad|bacchante]] tried to draw him towards the temple of lust.&lt;ref name=86f/&gt;
[[File:Johann Heinrich Ramberg - Siegfried von Lindenberg 1790.jpg|thumb|left|Watercolour by [[Johann Heinrich Ramberg]] of a performance of ''Siegfried von Lindenberg'' at the Societaetstheater in 1790]]
The society of friends of the theatre grew to fifty members, and by the end of the 18th century to more than 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gruber |first=Eckhard |title=Der Mensch hascht unaufhörlich nach Vergnügen. Zur Geschichte des Societätstheaters und anderer 'Bühnen im Taschenformat' |location=Berlin |publisher=Alexander |year=1998 |oclc=40371593 |page=97 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; They belonged to both the nobility and the middle class and agreed to a 25-article constitution which included equality of members. Decisions and assignment of positions were voted on; five board members, a secretary and a cashier were elected, whose duties included determining the list of plays and assignment of roles.

The constitution divided the society's membership into active and passive members.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (1998), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The active members were overwhelmingly attached to the court of Saxony. For example, the privy advisor of the privy council, [[Hans Ernst von Teubern]], translated scripts into German. The poet [[August Gottlieb Meißner]] used his influence within the society to secure performances of works by his friend [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. Other members wrote plays themselves or, like the painter [[Ernst Ferdinand Oehme]] in the 19th century, performed on stage. Altogether between 20 and 30 of the members were active as performers, leading to frequent doubling of roles.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (1998), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The passive members included aristocratic patrons who funded needs such as costumes or the upkeep of the theatre. Such benefactors included Prince [[Charles of Saxony, Duke of Courland|Charles of Saxony]], Count [[Alois Friedrich von Brühl]] and Count [[Hans Moritz von Brühl]].

Productions took place mainly in the winter season, between September and early May.&lt;ref name="Hübler2012"/&gt; Like almost all other theatres, the Societaetstheater closed for [[Lent]]. However, performances also took place on Fridays and Sundays, which out of respect for religion were avoided by public theatres in Dresden until the early 19th century. Performances of the Societaetstheater were usually restricted to members' family, friends and acquaintances;&lt;ref name="Hübler2012"/&gt; a 1792 announcement speaks of each member receiving three tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Dresdner Merkwürdigkeiten gemeinnützigen Inhalts |volume=VIII |date=24 February 1792 |page=61 |quotation=Jedes Mitglied erhält drei Billets, die es an seine Freunde und Bekannte vertheilen kann. Blos mittels eines solchen Billets kann man den theatralischen Vorstellungen dieser Gesellschaft beiwohnen. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outsiders were admitted only in exceptional cases and after presenting a [[Visiting card|calling card]].

Nonetheless, the theatre soon acquired a reputation extending outside Saxony. Productions were reported on in theatrical publications alongside those of the established court theatres and tours by well known companies. The persistence of the theatre was remarked on, since similar associations were at the time usually short-lived. It became a model which was emulated in various cities. In Dresden itself, where there were also two public theatres, a summer theatre, and touring productions, a second theatrical association, the Freundschaftliche Theater, was founded in 1787; since some of the members belonged to both, this was combined with the Societaetstheater in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (1998), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1802, there were a total of twelve other theatres in Dresden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bericht aus Dresden vom 15.5.1802 |newspaper=Journal des Luxus und der Moden |date=July 1802 |page=403 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing===
The Societaetstheater was originally entirely amateur. There is no record of any appearances by actors from public theatres until 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (1998), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century this began to change, as upcoming actors increasingly discovered the theatre as a place to hone their talent. Actresses including Demoiselle Hartmann, the Weinhold sisters and [[Luise Wagner]], sister of [[Richard Wagner]], used the theatre to make the transition to professional careers. The years around 1800 also saw a generational shift from the founders to their successors, who chose the stage as their profession while retaining close ties to the Societaetstheater, where they had begun theur association with the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (1998), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bourgeois drawing-room dramas which dominated the repertoires of theatres of all sizes at the beginning of the 19th century made few demands in casting, time, settings or props. However, the general movement towards grand historical dramas, such as those by [[Goethe]] and [[Schiller]], with their demanding costumes, complex verse which was difficult to memorise and to recite, and large casts, once more opened a gulf between professional and amateur drama. Dilettantism had a negative connotation; Goethe and Schiller themselves collaborated in the summer of 1799 on a compilation with that as its theme, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Über den Dilettantismus|de}}''. The Societaetstheater produced simple dramas and comedies, some slapstick; no production of Goethe or Schiller there is recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (1998), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre's reputation waned, and as the national theatre movement gained in importance, it was excluded from the mainstream. Many of the upper middle class regarded amateur theatre as at best a "harmless pleasure" with no particular moral or aesthetic merit.&lt;ref name=Neustadt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyer |first=Reinhard |contribution=Limitierte Aufklärung.

===Reopening===
[[File:Theater alt.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Theatre building before restoration]]

In 1837 a building was erected beside the theatre, covering almost half the façade.&lt;ref name=Magirius&gt;{{cite book |last=Magirius |first=Heinrich |contribution=Zur Bau- und Kunstgeschichte des Societätstheaters in Dresden-Neustadt |editor-last=Gruber |editor-first=Eckhard |work=Der Mensch hascht unaufhörlich nach Vergnügen |year=1998 |page=222 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second storey and more windows were added to the building itself, and beginning in the second half of the 19th century, it was used as a residence. In the early 20th century, small handwork businesses moved into what had been the foyer; traces of metalworking remain.&lt;ref name=Magirius/&gt; The premises were also reportedly used by a photographic studio and by the post office.

The building was not destroyed in the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden on 13 February 1945]], but fell into increasing disrepair after the war. In the 1950s and 60s, urgently needed repairs were not made, and from the 1970s on, the building was abandoned. Despite the renovation of the Hauptstraße beginning in 1978, the intention was to gut and demolish the building.&lt;ref name=Weg&gt;{{cite book |last=Gruber |first=Eckhard |contribution='Der Weg entsteht beim Gehen'. Ein Bericht über die Geschichte und Ziele des Societätstheater-Vereins |title=Der Mensch hascht unaufhörlich nach Vergnügen |year=1998 |page=235 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; The architect Jürgen Mehlhorn, who had become interested in the building while still a student and was now using it to store material for the reconstruction of other buildings on the street, in 1979 designed a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] for the main entrance at Hauptstraße 19 depicting two theatrical masks and with the inscription "Societaetstheater 1715 1779 1979".&lt;ref name=Weg/&gt; The association "Interessengemeinschaft Societaetstheater" was then founded; in 1992 this became "Societaetstheater e.V." The association worked to preserve the building and raised money for urgent repairs such as roof work and provisional safety measures. In 1985, the building became a registered landmark of the [[German Democratic Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (1998). "'Der Weg entsteht beim Gehen'". p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; More extensive repairs were made in 1989. After [[German reunification]] in 1990, [[Dresdner Bank]] sponsored the building's restoration. The Dresden city council decided in October 1994 that the theatre would be operated by the city once restored, and work began in 1996.

The building was restored based on its original state, with the addition of an annexe containing a cellar theatre, a restaurant and five guest rooms. The adjoining Baroque garden, which had belonged to the sculptor Johann Benjamin Thomae amongst others, was also restored, and a restored pavilion by Thomae placed in the centre. The theatre had its ceremonial reopening on 19 February 1999.

==Current uses==
The Societaetstheater today is a modern chamber theatre,&lt;ref name="Hübler2012"/&gt; accommodating spoken word, dance, music and puppet performances. Resident productions evolve by a workshop process harking back to the theatre's origins.&lt;ref name=Neustadt/&gt; Independent performers from the region as well as guest performers from Germany and other countries have appeared there. In addition to the main theatre and the cellar stage, performances may take place in the foyer and in the garden. It has served as one of the venues for the [[Jazztage Dresden]] festival.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13709">The '''Standard Theatre''' showcased [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia's]] most talented black performers and [[jazz]] musicians in the early twentieth century.  During its peak years (1915{{ndash}}1930), the Standard was one of Philadelphia's most famous and successful black theaters.  Its exceptional success can be attributed to its owner, [[John T. Gibson]], a black man who envisioned affordable entertainment for his own race.

== Opening ==
The Standard Theatre (or Standard Theater) originally opened in 1888 on the 1100 block of [[South Street (Philadelphia)|South Street]]. The Standard was primarily a venue for local and traveling [[vaudeville]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;Brian E. Alnutt, ''African-American Amusement and Recreation in Philadelphia, 1876{{ndash}}1926'' (PhD diss., Lehigh University, 2003), 224.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Standard was located near Philadelphia's neighborhoods with the highest black population: for instance, 23% of Philadelphia's black citizens lived in the 7th ward of [[South Philadelphia]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;Alnutt, ''African-American Amusement and Recreation,'' 93.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theater would occasionally showcase black productions, such as in November 1897, when the theater presented Bob Cole and William Johnson's ''A Trip to Coontown'', a musical created and performed by black men.&lt;ref&gt;Alnutt, ''African-American Amusement and Recreation,'' 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of this, the Standard maintained segregated admissions, alienating many of the black residents in the neighborhood.

Before 1914, the Standard Theatre had seen occasional yet sporadic black ownership.  For example, a group of black investors from [[New York City]] led by [[Gibson Young]] leased the theater in 1913, with the promise of "altogether coloured management."  In spite of its initial great success, business declined.  By that October the Standard was again leased to white ownership, which returned to practicing [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].  This was a great emotional loss to the black community, who saw the Standard Theater finally becoming a site of entertainment for their own race.&lt;ref&gt;Alnutt, ''African-American Amusement and Recreation,'' 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purchase ==
John T. Gibson leased the Standard Theatre in January 1914.  In an interview almost two years after his purchase, Gibson said the following: "When I bought the New Standard theater, I felt that there was a field in this city for good clean [[Black Vaudeville|Negro vaudeville]] at popular prices."&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Gray "Gibson's Standard Theatre" ''The Freeman'' (Indianapolis: 10/09/1915)&lt;/ref&gt;  Gibson's premiere show opened with J. Lubrie Hill's ''Darktown Follies'', a musical comedy featuring Southern rural characters.  ''The Freeman'' described the event as a "decided success", and one that "Philadelphia can be proud of... the citizens will rally around Manager Gibson." The original ticket prices ranged from 25 cents to $1.00.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Gray "Gibson's Standard Theatre" ''The Freeman'' (Indianapolis: 01/31/1914)&lt;/ref&gt;
In May, Gibson officially bought the Standard, becoming its sale owner and manager.  At this point, the theater was valued at $70,000, making it one of the most valuable pieces of property owned by a single black man in the country.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Gray "Gibson's Standard Theatre" ''The Freeman'' (Indianapolis: 05/23/1914)&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first two years, the Standard Theatre presented a variety of performances at low cost.  The musical repertoire included southern folk songs, [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era .281781.E2.80.931860.29|antebellum]] plantation songs, vaudeville numbers, musicals, and blues.  The theater also showed fantastic performances, including magicians, acrobats, and animal performances.  For example, a performance in February 1915 featured the Monkey Cabaret Orchestra, consisting of eight monkeys in the orchestra who accompanied more monkeys performing on stage with a dog.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Gray "Gibson's Standard Theatre" ''The Freeman'' (Indianapolis: 02/06/1915)&lt;/ref&gt;  Gibson took pride in his performers.  When asked by a reporter what the theater relied on most, he replied "Good acts, well acted... it has been and will continue to be my method to regard the actor as a medium and not as a marionette."&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Gray "Gibson's Standard Theatre" ''The Freeman'' (Indianapolis: 08/14/1915)&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 1915, Gibson finished renovations on the Standard Theatre.  The renovations included newly painted interior, gilded ceilings, and increased seating to 2,000.  While renovating his theater, Gibson employed black painters, artists, and construction workers in his efforts to spread wealth among the black citizens in the area.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Gray "Gibson's Standard Theatre" ''The Freeman'' (Indianapolis: 11/06/1915)&lt;/ref&gt;  After this point, Gibson claimed to have a standing offer for $180,000 for the theater, which he regularly declined: "Commercialism has nothing whatever to go with my project," he said. "My idea is to give my people the best of it all the time."&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Gray "Gibson's Standard Theatre" ''The Freeman'' (Indianapolis: 04/22/1916)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1918, The Standard Theatre's success made John T. Gibson the richest black man in the state of [[Pennsylvania]].  The Standard Theater was one of only 59 theaters owned by a single person in Philadelphia.  ''[[Washington Bee|The Washington Bee]]'' credited his success to his optimism loyalty to his race: "Despite his great wealth, Mr. Gibson is a race man.  His affections are remarkably developed.  His heart is large.  It is necessary at times to retrain his willingness.  He is an apostle of optimism.  His wide, his home, his theater, his city, his state, his country are the finest.  There is no limit to their possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;"John T. Gibson, "The Richest Colored Man in Pennsylvania" ''The Washington Bee'' (D.C.: 06/06/1918)&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1920s ==
During the [[Roaring Twenties|twenties]], the Standard Theatre peaked in its success.  A major factor in this success was increased ticket sales.  Massive audience turnouts resulted in part from new waves of black Philadelphians.  In the beginning of the twentieth century, millions of black Americans fled to northern cities, escaping southern segregation and [[Jim Crow]] laws.  This movement became known as the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].  In the teens, Philadelphia's black population increased by fifty percent, reading a total of 134,220.  This growth continued through the twenties, reaching a black population of 219,559 by 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew J. Countryman, "Why Philadelphia?" ''Civil Rights in a Northern City: Philadelphia'', http://northerncity.library.temple.edu/content/historical-perspective/why-philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt;   Newly arrived performers and audience members alike sought out theaters that hired and catered to black Philadelphians.  In the early twenties, the Standard embodied black entertainment in Philadelphia.  Gibson responded to growing audiences and monetary success by purchasing the nearby Dunbar Theater in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;"Standard Theatre Historical Marker," ''Explore PA History'', last modified 2011, http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-62&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, jazz flourished in Philadelphia.  Jazz music infiltrated the mainstream music culture, receiving praise from more conventional musicians.  For instance, the conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra [[Leopold Stokowski]] compared jazz music to "the injection of new... blood into a dying aristocracy."&lt;ref&gt;Russell L. Johnson, "'Disease Is Unrhythmical': Jazz, Health, and Disability in 1920s America," ''Health and History'' 13, no. 2 (2011): 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  As jazz music became more recognized as socially respectable music, the Standard's audiences became more integrated as white Philadelphians came to more shows.  While the shows had always been integrated, the increased number of white audience members contributed to Gibson's high earnings.  Perhaps reacting to the influx of white audience members, black critics began to change their tastes in performances.  Sandy Burns, a comedian who specialized in blackface performance, received rave reviews from Freeman papers in the teens.  But by 1926, his performance received scathing reviews, and he was criticized as "a past master at portraying the old razor-slashing Negro."&lt;ref&gt;Alnutt, ''African-American Amusement and Recreation,'' 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  While vaudeville comedy still lit the stage, Gibson changed his focus to musical performers, specifically big bands.  It is during this period that The Standard Theater showcased some of the top names in jazz at the time.  In 1927, [[Duke Ellington]] and his Washingtonians performed for two weeks at the Standard Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Tucker, ''The Duke Ellington Reader'' (Oxford: University of Oxford Press, 1993), 241.&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1929, [[Louis Armstrong]] performed in the Standard, fronting for the Luis Russell Band.&lt;ref&gt;James Lincoln Collier, ''Louis Armstrong: An American Genius'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983), 218.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Ellington and Armstrong's lead, numerous big band leaders added the Standard as a stopping point on their tours.

== Closing ==
In 1931, Gibson sold the Standard Theatre due to his losses from the [[Great Depression]].  As big band music began its decline, the Standard Theater was turned into a movie theater, losing its performance space for live musicians and performers.   The theater officially closed in 1954 and was demolished in 1957.  In 1992, the Pennsylvania Historical &amp; Museum Commission placed a historical marker to commemorate the theater and its owner.  It is placed at the theater's original location, on the 11th block of South Street.&lt;ref&gt;"Standard Theatre Historical Marker," ''Explore PA History'', last modified 2011, http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-62&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other notable performers ==
A young [[Ethel Waters]] found inspiration in the performances she saw at the Standard.  Early in her career, she often imitated acts she had seen when performing in other cities.  In 1917, she returned to Philadelphia and performed at the Standard: "My return to Philadelphia turned into something of a triumph when we were booked for two weeks at the Standard Theatre, where I'd watched shows from the peanut gallery.  It was still the city's leading Negro showhouse, and the engagement meant I was recognized in my home town as an established professional performer."&lt;ref&gt;Ethel Waters, "His Eye is on the Sparrow: An Autobiography" (De Capo Press, 1992), 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Waters moved to New York in 1919, she would still perform at the Standard whenever she passed through Philadelphia, most notably performing for a week in June 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Alnutt, "African-American Amusement and Recreation," 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Black Vaudeville#The Whitman Sisters|The Whitman Sisters]] consisted of four sisters (Essie, Mabel, Alberta, and Baby Alice) who performed vaudeville routines all along the eastern coast.  Their acts included tap dancing, musical numbers, comedy sketches, and crossdressing.  The Whitman Sisters regularly performed at the Standard throughout the late teens as the star act of the show.&lt;ref&gt;"The Whitman Sisters," American Vaudeville Museum, last modified 2011, http://www.vaudeville.org/profiles_Q_Z/index_files/Page1126.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bessie Smith]] began to regularly perform at the Standard in 1923.  Although she spent time touring around the country, she settled in Philadelphia, bringing her family with her.  According to jazz trombonist Clyde Bernhardt, "Bessie Smith's sister, Viola, had a restaurant called Viola's Place across from the Standard Theater on South Street.  Bessie put up the money for it..."&lt;ref&gt;Clyde E. B. Bernhardt, ''I Remember: Eighty Years of Black Entertainment, Big Bands, and the Blues: An Autobiography'', (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Trump–Tsai call''' was a telephone conversation between the U.S [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Donald Trump]] and the President of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (commonly known as [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan]]) [[Tsai Ing-wen]] which took place on December 2, 2016. This event marked the first time since 1979 that a U.S. President or President-elect had directly spoken with a [[President of the Republic of China|ROC President]]. In the call, Tsai congratulated Trump for his victory in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|presidential election]]. The two leaders spoke for around 10 minutes, focusing on politics, economy, and security in [[Asia-Pacific]]. Following the call, Trump publicized this on [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] and said thank you to "the President of Taiwan". After Trump's transition team confirmed the event, the [[Presidential Office Building, Taiwan|Presidential Office of Taiwan]] released a statement about the content of the call.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-spoke-with-taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen-1480718423 |title=Trump Spoke With Taiwan President in Break With Decades of U.S. Policy |website= [[The Wall Street Journal]] |date= December 2, 2016 |first1= Damian |last1=Paletta|first2=Carol E. |last2=Lee |first3=Andrew |last3=Browne }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/trump-phone-call-taiwan-president-major-breakthrough-article-1.2896742 |title=President-elect Donald Trump's phone call to Taiwan's leader is a major breakthrough for U.S. relations with the nation |website= [[New York Daily News]] |date=December 2, 2016 |first=Gerrit |last=Van Der Wees}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "接台灣賀電很應該"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/new/20161203/1003503/ |title = 川普再推文：美國對台軍售　接台灣賀電很應該 |author = 施旖婕 |date = December 3, 2016 |publisher = ''[[Apple Daily (Taiwan)|Apple Daily]]'' |language = zh-tw |accessdate = December 4, 2016 |quote = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161205171618/http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/new/20161203/1003503/ |archivedate = December 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several prominent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] praised the call between the two leaders, saying that the United States needs no more pressure from the government of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (commonly called "China"), which does not recognize the ROC government and [[One-China Policy|claims Taiwan is part of its territory]].&lt;ref name="Bolton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/12/03/trump-phone-call-taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen-john-bolton-un-china |title=Bolton on Trump's Taiwan Call: China Doesn't Tell Us Who We Can Talk To |website= [[Fox News]] |date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators from U.S. media outlets said that the call humiliated [[Beijing]] as it seemed a violation of a diplomatic practice.

In 1972, U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] [[1972 Nixon visit to China|visited Mainland China]], and met with [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Zhou Enlai]], then the two parties agreed on the "One-China" policy (i.e. the positions of then governments of the two sides across the [[Taiwan Strait]] "at that time" both claim there is only "one China" in the world).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/ziliao/3602/3604/t18006.htm Nixon's China's Visit and "Sino-U.S. Joint Communiqué"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205183408/http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/ziliao/3602/3604/t18006.htm |date=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voacantonese.com/a/taiwan-us-alliance-20160915/3510175.html 蔡明憲：美國官員稱 未承認台灣為中國一部分], [[Voice of America]], 2016/9/15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s administration formally cut ties with the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan, establishing relations with the PRC. Since the severing of diplomatic relations, the Presidents of the United States and the Republic of China have never formally met or made calls in line with the policy. But the 1979 [[Act of Congress]] [[Taiwan Relations Act]] and the 1982 [[Six Assurances]] between the governments between U.S. and Taiwan have defined the substantial relations between the peoples of the United States and Taiwan.

After [[Tsai Ing-wen]]'s victory in Taiwan's [[Taiwan presidential election, 2016|presidential election]] in 2016, analysts predicted that Tsai's [[Democratic Progressive Party]] would install a largely pro-American government,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} in contrast to that of former President [[Ma Ying-jeou]]'s [[Kuomintang]], which called for close co-operation with Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Tom|title=Taiwan's new president Tsai Ing-wen vows to reduce dependence on Beijing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/taiwans-new-president-tsai-ing-wen-vows-to-reduce-dependence-on-beijing|accessdate=December 24, 2016|work=The Guardian|date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sizing Tsai up|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21698707-tsai-ing-wen-has-delicate-balancing-act-both-home-and-china-sizing-tsai-up|accessdate=December 24, 2016|work=The Economist|date=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, Trump raised doubt on Twitter: "Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?

==Reactions==
===Trump transition team===
Vice President-elect [[Mike Pence]] said "the conversation with the President of Taiwan was a courtesy call." "It's striking to me that President Obama would reach out to a murdering dictator in Cuba and be hailed as a hero. And President-elect Donald Trump takes a courtesy call from the democratically-elected President of Taiwan and it becomes something of a thing in the media." "You're going to see ... President Donald Trump ... engage the world on America's terms."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-12-04-16-n691726 MEET THE PRESS 12/04/16], [[NBC News]], December 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]], a close adviser to Trump, praised the President-elect's conversation with [[Taiwan]]ese President of 23.5 million people as he would be to communicate with the democratically elected leader of any nation. He compares Trump's Taiwan call to [[United States–Cuban Thaw|President Obama's visit to Cuba to hang out with the Castro dictatorship]] and suggests the dialogue resets a more favorable relationship for the U.S. with China. "...[[State Department]] mythology that we have to somehow let the Chinese dictate to us is nonsense... They are not going to be able to intimidate us." He urged Trump to reform the [[United States Department of State|DOS]] to more closely align with [[American values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Louis |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-taiwan-china-newt-gingrich-232190 |title=Gingrich: Under Trump, China won't intimidate us |work=Politico |date=December 5, 2016 |accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/06/gingrich-trumps-phone-call-with-taiwan-leader-very-tough-signal-to-beijing.html Gingrich: Trump's phone call with Taiwan leader 'a very tough signal to Beijing'], [[Fox News]], December 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congress===
[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Paul Ryan]] said, "I spoke with the President of Taiwan when she was transferring planes in Miami a couple months ago. It is prudent for the President-elect to take congratulatory calls — absolutely. I think for him to not take a congratulatory call would in and of itself be considered a snub. So I think everything is fine."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-tariffs-paul-ryan-232249 Ryan defends Trump on Taiwan], ''[[Politico]]'', December 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkmedianews.com/uncategorized/2016/12/06/ryan-trump-right-to-accept-phone-call-from-taiwans-president/ Ryan: Trump right to accept phone call from Taiwan’s president], Talk Media News, December 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump's former primary competitor Senator [[Ted Cruz]] defends the call by comparing Obama's foreign policy "I would much rather have Donald Trump talking to President Tsai than to Cuba's Raul Castro or Iran's Hasan Rouhani. This is an improvement" on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/12/03/ted-cruz-defends-trumps-call-with-taiwan-president-an-improvement-over-obamas-foreign-policy/ Ted Cruz defends Trump’s call with Taiwan president: ‘An improvement’ over Obama’s foreign policy], [[The Blaze]], December 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Tom Cotton]] commends President-elect Trump for his conversation with President Tsai Ing-wen, which reaffirms U.S. commitment "America's policy toward Taiwan is governed by the Taiwan Relations Act, under which we maintain close ties with Taiwan and support its democratic system... I have met with President Tsai twice and I'm confident she expressed to the president-elect the same desire for closer relations with the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=547 Cotton Statement on President-elect Trump’s phone call with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen], Senator [[Tom Cotton]], December 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] Chair [[Ed Royce]] said "I presume that phone conversation was a courtesy call from the President of Taiwan to the President of the United States... I was not too surprised... I go to [[Taipei]] and Beijing. Every year we lead a large bipartisan delegation in order to discuss these issues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Ed-Royce-Trump-Taiwan-Phone-Call/2016/12/06/id/762480/ Ed Royce: Trump's Taiwan Phone Call 'Not That Big an Issue'], [[Newsmax]], December 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Democratic ranking member of the Committee [[Eliot Engel]] emphasizes the U.S. is the leader of the free world and should defend democratic values.

Congressman [[Dana Rohrabacher]] applauded Trump's phone call with Taiwan's president was "terrific" because of the diplomatic warning it sent to China. He said that, "He showed the dictators in Beijing that he's not a pushover. China has had an enormously aggressive foreign policy and by him actually going to Taiwan, he's showing the people in Beijing that they cannot have this aggressive foreign policy and expect to be treated just the same by an American president."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/dana-rohrabacher-trump-taiwan-232188 Rohrabacher: Trump's Taiwan call shows China he's not a pushover], ''[[Politico]]'', December 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/secretary-of-state-candidate-rep-dana-rohrabacher-defends-russia-denounces-china-201557094.html Secretary of state candidate Rep.

===Experts and media===
Former [[Governor of Utah]] as well as U.S. Ambassador to Singapore and China [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.|Jon Huntsman]] says "The call came in from President Tsai Ing-wen. He made the choice to take it, which I think was absolutely right... I'm sure he's got a broader strategy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ambassador-china-jon-huntsman-trump-absolutely-taiwan-call/story?id=43989236 Former Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman Says Trump 'Absolutely Right' to Take Taiwan Call], [[ABC News]], December 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[US Ambassador to the United Nations]] [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]] also supports Trump's interaction with President of Taiwan with democratic government, free press, and free-market economic system. He said, "Nobody in Beijing gets to dictate who we talk to. It's ridiculous to think that the phone call upsets decades of anything." "We should shake the relationship up. For the past several years China has made aggressive... belligerent claims in the South China Sea."&lt;ref name="Bolton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolton" /&gt;

Former deputy Undersecretary of the Navy and Professor [[Seth Cropsey]] said claiming that democratic Taiwan is part of the totalitarian People's Republic of China is just like the story of [[The Emperor's New Clothes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|authorlink=Seth Cropsey|first=Seth |last=Cropsey |url=http://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2016/12/07/doing_the_right_thing_the_taiwan_phone_call_110451.html |title=Doing the Right Thing: The Taiwan Phone Call |website=RealClearDefense |date= December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former managing editor of ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', contributing editor of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, and now [[CNN]] host [[Fareed Zakaria]] said the President-elect Trump's call with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan was not a bad idea while some people are getting a bit too critical. "The truth of the matter is we need leverage with China... on many issues we need to be able to push them harder... The key here is that it should be part of a thought-through strategy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/media/308732-cnns-zakaria-gives-unexpected-defense-of-trumps-taiwan-call |title=CNN's Zakaria gives unexpected defense of Trump's Taiwan call |website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=December 5, 2016 |first=Joe |last=Concha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was to be headlined by a [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship]] bout, between champion [[Jon Jones]] and former dual-division [[PRIDE FC]] and [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]] champion [[Dan Henderson]]. However, the event was cancelled on August 23, when the UFC announced Henderson was unable to fight due to injury, and Jones refused to take a replacement fight against longtime middleweight contender, [[Chael Sonnen]].&lt;ref name="MMA Fighting 151"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shane Roller vs. Jacob Volkmann Slated for UFC 151|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/ufc/2012/7/24/3184849/shane-roller-vs-jacob-volkmann-slated-for-ufc-151|publisher=MMAFighting.com|accessdate=2012-07-24|date=2012-07-24|last=Al-Shatti|first=Shaun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancellation===
On August 23, [[Dana White]] announced that Henderson had sustained a partial rupture of his [[Medial collateral ligament|MCL]] and had withdrawn from the fight. White then announced via press conference that UFC 151 would be the first event in the organization's history to be cancelled, after Jones declined to fight [[Chael Sonnen]], who agreed to take the fight on eight days' notice. Initially, White announced that Jones would defend his title against [[Lyoto Machida]] at [[UFC 152]] and that UFC 151 simply would not take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/dan-henderson-injured-ufc-151-181230662--mma.html|title=Dan Henderson Injured; UFC 151 Cancelled|publisher=Yahoo!

The UFC announced that former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion [[Vitor Belfort]] would challenge Jon Jones at UFC 152.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/30353/vitor-belfort-replaces-lyoto-machida-against-champ-jon-jones-at-ufc-152.mma |title=Vitor Belfort replaces Lyoto Machida against champ Jon Jones at UFC 152 |publisher=MMAjunkie.com |date=2012-08-24 |accessdate=2012-08-24 |last=Marrocco |first=Steven |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103205408/http://www.mmajunkie.com/news/2012/08/vitor-belfort-replaces-lyoto-machida-against-champ-jon-jones-at-ufc-152 |archivedate=2013-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial reports indicated that [[UFC 152]], scheduled to take place three weeks later, would be renamed UFC 151.  However, Zuffa announced that UFC 152 would keep its name and UFC 151 would officially be deemed a "lost show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/ufc-152-remains-toronto-moniker-210046925--mma.html|title=UFC 152 Remains Toronto Moniker; Cancelled UFC 151 Event is the 'Lost Show' |work=MMAWeekly.com |date=2012-08-23 |accessdate=2012-08-23 |publisher=Yahoo! Sports |author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UFC middleweight champion at the time, [[Anderson Silva]] reportedly offered to save the event by fighting any light heavyweight other than Jon Jones,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmafighting.com/2012/8/24/3264668/anderson-silva-offered-to-save-ufc-151&lt;/ref&gt; and UFC middleweight contender at the time [[Chris Weidman]] also inquired about fighting Jones,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmafighting.com/2012/8/23/3263406/chris-weidman-says-he-volunteered-to-fight-jon-jones-at-ufc-151&lt;/ref&gt; but both offers arrived too late, after cancellation processes began.

Dana White blamed the cancellation on Jones and his coach Greg Jackson, who advised him that accepting the fight with Sonnen on short notice would be the "biggest mistake of [his] entire career".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Critchfield, Tristen |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Despite-Dana-Whites-Tirade-Greg-Jackson-Stands-By-Advice-He-Offered-to-Jon-Jones-45131 |title=Despite Dana White’s Tirade, Greg Jackson Stands By Advice He Offered to Jon Jones |publisher=[[Sherdog]] |date=2012-08-23 |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some MMA analysts see the UFC at fault for promoting thin cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fowlkes |first=Ben |date=2012-08-25 |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/30365/a-guide-to-playing-a-complex-blame-game-in-the-wake-of-ufc-151s-cancellation.mma |title=A guide to playing a complex blame game in the wake of UFC 151's cancellation |publisher=[[MMAjunkie.com]] |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; With fights occurring nearly every weekend, the pool of fighters available as substitutes when injuries occur is shallow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schmidt |first=Erik |date=2012-08-23 |url=http://www.prosportsblogging.com/2012/08/23/no-bones-about-it-ufc-151-canceled-after-jones-declined-fight-with-sonnen/ |title=No Bones About It: UFC 151 canceled after Jones declines fight with Sonnen |publisher=ProSportsBlogging.com |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Braiterman |first=Cory |date=2012-08-24 |url=http://www.mmamania.com/2012/8/24/3264952/the-ufc-151-debacle-blame-list-who-you-should-be-mad-at-and-why |title=The UFC 151 Cancellation Blame List: Who You Should Be Mad At and Why |publisher=MMAmania.com |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CBS Sports]] columnist Gregg Doyel argued Dana White's mishandling of UFC 151 proved that UFC competitors need a union, stating: "...fights fall through all the time&amp;nbsp;– the flimsy card fell apart.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2061">'''Washington International Renewable Energy Conference''' is a meeting of senior-level representatives from the [[Executive (government)|Executive]] and [[Legislative]] branches of the United States government at the national and subnational level, [[international organization]]s, the finance and business community, and [[civil society]] who are working to advance the integration of [[renewable energy]] in their countries.

It is hosted in cooperation with the American Council On Renewable Energy (ACORE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acore.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Official Side Events==

Official Side Events are a forum for non-governmental, governmental, and/or inter-governmental partners to showcase their projects/programs in front of a high level public and private sector audience. 

== History ==
One of the major accomplishments of the 2002 [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD) in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], was the recognition that renewable energy is a critical component of sustainable development, energy security, [[climate change]], and air quality. 

Worldwide enthusiasm for renewable energy has increased dramatically since WSSD, both multilaterally (e.g., 2004 Bonn Renewable Energy Conference, 2005 Beijing International Renewable Energy Conference, G-8, etc.), bilaterally, and nationally. Nations now more fully recognize the imperative to promote widespread adoption of renewable energy, such as biofuels, wind, solar, geothermal, and hydro energies, into their countries' energy mix to promote sustained economic growth, social development, and environmental stewardship.

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2013}}
The '''World Science Forum''' (WSF) is an international conference series on global science policy. Since 2003, it is organised biannually in [[Budapest]], Hungary. 

The WSF traces back its origin to the first [[World Conference on Science]], organised by [[UNESCO]] and [[ICSU]] and held in Budapest in 1999. The first WSF was organised in 2003, followed by the second in 2005 and the third in 2007. The fourth WSF was held from 5 through 7 November 2009 in Budapest, Hungary, focusing on "Knowledge and future". The fifth World Science Forum was held between 17 and 19 November 2011 in Budapest, it focused on "The changing landscape of science".&lt;ref name="WSF-HAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mta.hu/news_and_views/from-world-conference-to-world-forum-a-history-of-world-science-forum-128819/|title=From World Conference to World Forum - a History of World Science Forum|publisher=HAS - [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Science Forum aims at being the "Davos of Science" and achieving the same global strategic impact on science and science policy as the [[World Economic Forum]] does it in the field of global economic policy.

== Origin, vision and mission ==
By the end of the 20th century, science and knowledge became essential parts of Mankind's everyday lives. Scientific knowledge is not only the result of Humanity's inherent curiosity and scientific endeavor, it is a powerful means of understanding human nature, society, and the Nature in which humans live. Advance in science is a major contributor to society's [[socio-economic development]], the global welfare of humankind, man's relation to Nature, and the quality of life. 

In past centuries the predominant role of science was the production of new knowledge to satisfy the curiosity of the human mind. In recent years, the role of science has undergone changes, as scientific inquiry has increasingly become the motor of development in society. By the end of the 20th century, science had taken on a number of new roles. These novel roles may – and should – contribute in a decisive manner to the daily life of humankind in the 21st century. 

In spite of its spectacular development and new opportunities, the science of 21st century faces wavering confidence, unseen dilemmas and new questions. These problems can be solved only if the main procedures and users of knowledge are able to reach common ground for the new roles of knowledge and science in 21st century's global society.

These issues were discussed at the World Conference on Science from 26 June to 1 July 1999 in Budapest, Hungary. The conference was organised by [[UNESCO]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU), with the participation of over 2000 delegates from 186 countries. 

As a follow-up to the World Conference on Science, the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] (HAS), in partnership with UNESCO and ICSU, initiated a unique forum series for a much needed genuine debate and hopefully lasting interaction between the scientific community and society. Three members of HAS played a key role in establishing the World Science Forum series: [[István Láng]],&lt;ref name="WSF-HAS"/&gt;&lt;!-- not a scientist but a Hungarian composer associated with UNESCO--&gt; the organiser of the 1999 World Conference of Science; [[Balázs Gulyás]], the founding director of the WSF series; and [[E. Sylvester Vizi]], the then president of HAS. At present the President of World Science Forum is Professor József Pálinkás, President of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

'''Mission of WSF'''

– To provide major stakeholders with a global forum for dialogue on science and its role and responsibility in the 21st Century.

– To better understand and promote the need for science and scientific advice in political and economic decision-making.
