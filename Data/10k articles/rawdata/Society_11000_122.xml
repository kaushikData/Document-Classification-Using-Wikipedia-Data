'''Bengali Buddhists''', ({{lang-bn|বাঙালি বৌদ্ধ}}), are [[Buddhist]]s of [[Bengali people|Bengal]]i [[Bengali people|ethnic]] and [[Bengali language|linguistic]] [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. Bengali Buddhists constitute 0.4% of the population in Bangladesh.

[[Buddhism]] has a rich ancient heritage in the Bengal. The region was a bastion of the ancient Buddhist [[Mauryan]] and [[Pala Empire|Palan]] empires, when the [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] schools flourished. South-eastern Bengal was ruled by the medieval [[Buddhist]] [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] during the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[British Raj]] influenced the emergence of modern community.

Today, Bengali Buddhists are followers of orthodox [[Therevada Buddhism]].

==History==
[[File:Somapura Mahavihara, Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|left|[[Somapura Mahavihara]] from the [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]]]
Ancient Bengal was a center of Buddhist learning and art. Buddhist artifacts have been excavated throughout the region, particularly in [[Wari-Bateshwar]], [[Chandraketugarh]], [[Somapura Mahavihara|Paharpur]], [[Mahasthangarh]] and [[Mainamati]]. The [[Mauryan Empire]] led by [[Ashoka]] extended its [[suzerainty]] to the region in the 2nd century BCE. Ashoka played an important role in propagating Buddhism in his own empire and the wider ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Mauryan rule was succeeded by the Buddhist [[Samatata]] maritime kingdom in Bengal.

Successive Buddhist powers tussled for dominance with [[Hindu]] and [[Jain]] kings in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Bengali Buddhist [[Pala Empire]] arose during the 8th century. Founded by the election of Buddhist chieftain [[Gopala]] circa 750 CE, the empire grew into one of the largest imperial powers in classical Asia. The Palas promoted [[Mahayana]] and [[Tantric Buddhism]]. They patronized the creation of many outstanding temples, monasteries and works of art. The Palas enjoyed strong relations with the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the [[Tibetan Empire]] and the [[Srivijaya Empire]]. The empire reached its peak under [[Dharmapala]] and [[Devapala (Pala dynasty)|Devapala]]. They reigned for four centuries until being replaced by the resurgent Hindu [[Sena dynasty]]. [[Brahmin]] persecution played a key role in the [[decline of Buddhism in India]]; followed by later Muslim conquest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmri.org.uk/articles/pre-islam_bengal_society.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Shalban Bihar Temple Ruins 003.jpg|thumb|The [[Mainamati]] Buddhist ruins in southeastern Bangladesh]]
Remnants of Buddhist communities continued to flourish in southeastern Bengal. The Buddhist [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] ruled the region during the 16th and 17th centuries.

By the late 18th-century, the region was ceded to the [[British Empire]]. During this period, a revival movement developed &lt;ref name="buddhistdoor.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistdoor.net/features/jewel-in-the-crown-bengals-buddhist-revival-in-the-19th-and-20th-centuries|title=Jewel in the Crown: Bengal's Buddhist Revival in the 19th and 20th Centuries}}&lt;/ref&gt; that led to the development of two orders of Theravada monks, the [[Sangharaj Nikaya]] and the [[Mahasthabir Nikaya]].

Bengali Buddhists benefited from Western education during the [[British Raj]] in the early-20th century.&lt;ref name="buddhistchannel.tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=8,1749,0,0,1,0#.VciWAnGqqko|title=Opinion - A glimpse of Buddhism in ancient Bangladesh|work=buddhistchannel.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Benimadhab Barua]] (1888-1948) was the first Asian to receive a [[Doctor of Letters]] degree from the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name="buddhistchannel.tv"/&gt; Bengali Buddhist activists and guerrillas were also active in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].

The '''Bulgarian Muslims''' or ''' Muslim Bulgarians''' ({{lang-bg|Българи-мохамедани}}, ''Bǎlgari-mohamedani'', as of recently also Българи-мюсюлмани, ''Bǎlgari-mjusjulmani'', locally called ''[[pomak]]'', ''ahryan'', ''poganets'', ''marvak'', or ''poturnak'') are [[Bulgarians]] of Islamic faith.&lt;ref name=bakalov1&gt;{{cite book |title=Електронно издание "История на България" |language=Bulgarian |last=Бакалов |first=Георги |author2=Милен Куманов |publisher=Труд, Сирма |location=София |year=2003 |isbn=954528613X |chapter=Помохамеданчване на българи }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally thought to be the descendents of the local [[Slavs]] who converted to Islam during [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kristen R. Ghodsee|Kristen Ghodsee]], "Religious freedoms and Islamic revivalism: some contradiction of American foreign policy in Southeast Europe", East European Studies News (May–June 2007), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars have agreed that the Bulgarian Muslims are a "[[Religious denomination|religious group]] of Bulgarian Slavs who speak [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] as their [[mother tongue]] and do not understand [[Turkish language|Turkish]], but whose religion and customs are [[Islamic]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707093426/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Xdxsg6Eiej4J:www.ciaonet.org/conf/iec03/iec03_14-96.html+The+Pomaks:+A+Religious+Minority+in+The+Balkans,+Mario+Apostolov,+Institute+on+East+Central+Europe,+Columbia+University,+March,+1996&amp;hl=bg&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=bg ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Petia Mankova |url=http://www-gewi.kfunigraz.ac.at/csbsc/ulf/pomak_identities.htm |title=Ulf Brunnbauer |website=Gewi.kfunigraz.ac.at |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Balkans, Minorities and States in Conflict (1993), Minority Rights Publication, by Hugh Poulton, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarian Muslims live mostly in the [[Rhodopes]] &amp;ndash; [[Smolyan Province]], the southern part of the [[Pazardzhik Province|Pazardzhik]] and [[Kardzhali Province]]s and the eastern part of the [[Blagoevgrad Province]] in Southern [[Bulgaria]]. They also live in a group of villages in the [[Lovech Province]] in Northern Bulgaria. The name ''[[Pomak]]'' is pejorative in Bulgarian and is resented by most members of the community, especially by non-practising Muslims. The name adopted and used instead of Pomak is ''Bulgarian Muslims''.&lt;ref name=bakalov2&gt;{{cite book |title=Електронно издание "История на България" |language=Bulgarian |last=Бакалов |first=Георги |author2=Милен Куманов |publisher=Труд, Сирма |location=София |year=2003 |isbn=954528613X |chapter=Българи-мохамедани }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulgarian Muslims do not represent a homogenous community and have a multitude of ethnic and religious identities. A clear majority of them (127,350&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.bg/Census/StrReligion.htm |title=СТРУКТУРА НА НАСЕЛЕНИЕТО ПО ВЕРОИЗПОВЕДАНИЕ |website=Nsi.bg |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the latest census in 2001) declare themselves to be ethnic Bulgarians of Islamic faith. However, a significant percentage, in particular in the Central and Eastern Rhodopes (the [[Smolyan Province|Smolyan]] and [[Kardzhali Province]]), are not religious or choose to disassociate themselves from Islam. Thus, the Smolyan Province, which is largely populated by Bulgarian Muslims (approximately 117,000 or 71% of the population according to the Ministry of Interior in 1989&lt;ref name="imir-bg.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imir-bg.org/imir/books/malcinstvena%20politika%20na%20BKP.pdf |format=PDF |title=Малцинствената политика в България.

Considering the insignificant change in the number of Bulgarian Christians (from approximately 47,000 in 1989&lt;ref name="imir-bg.org"/&gt; to 41,792&lt;ref name="nsi.bg"/&gt; in 2001), the total number of ethnic Bulgarians in the province (122,806 or 87.7%&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.bg/Census_e/Census_e.htm |title=National Statistical Institute |website=Nsi.bg |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and that only 58,758 people or 41.9% of the population of the province declared to profess [[Islam]] in 2001, the vast majority of the undeclared must be of Bulgarian Muslim extraction.{{syn|date=June 2017}}

A similar phenomenon is observed in the [[Kardzhali Province]] (approximately 30,000 Bulgarian Muslims in 1989) and the [[Lovech Province]] (approximately 8,000 Bulgarian Muslims in 1989), where the percentage of the undeclared is also well above the national average: 13,430 or 8.2% for Kardzhali and 10,739 or 6.3% for Lovech, respectively. In both provinces, the number of ethnic Bulgarians is higher (for Kardzhali, significantly higher) than the number of Orthodox Christians - 55,930 Bulgarians compared with 35,551 Orthodox Christians for Kardzhali and 152,194 Bulgarians compared with 148,023 Orthodox Christians for Lovech.&lt;ref name="nsi.bg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

An additional, though smaller, number of Bulgarian Muslims, also from the Central and Eastern Rhodopes, have converted into [[Orthodox Christianity]] or have adopted a Christian identity since 1990. The process of conversion has affected mostly Muslim Bulgarians living among or next to ethnic Turks, i.e. the regions of [[Nedelino]], [[Kirkovo]], [[Zlatograd]] and [[Krumovgrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://niprodcr.blogspot.com/2010/07/blog-post_8528.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708054808/http://niprodcr.blogspot.com/2010/07/blog-post_8528.html |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bgnews.bg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgnews.bg/show_story.html?issue=254908128&amp;media=1523776&amp;class=170645920&amp;story=254908608 |title=Цифрови Системи – първият Интернет доставчик в България.

For example, only one-third of the Muslim Bulgarian population of the region of [[Kirkovo]], mostly people aged over 60, have Turkish or [[Arabic]] names.&lt;ref name="bgnews.bg"/&gt;

Unlike the Bulgarian Muslims in the Central and Eastern Rhodopes, who usually have a Bulgarian identity and are mostly secular Muslims, non-religious or have even adopted Christianity, the ones living on the western fringes of the [[Rhodopes]] (in the provinces of [[Pazardzhik]] and [[Blagoevgrad]]) are strongly religious and have preserved the [[Muslim]] customs and clothing. For example, out of 62,431 self-declared Muslims in the [[Blagoevgrad Province]] in 2001,&lt;ref name="nsi.bg"/&gt; 31,857&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; (more than half) have opted for Turkish ethnicity although the self-declared speakers of Turkish as a mother tongue are only 19,819.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.bg/Census_e/Census_e.htm |title=National Statistical Institute |website=Nsi.bg |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that mother tongue in the Bulgarian census is counted on the basis of a declaration of the respondent and not on actual proof of what language this person speaks at home and that an inquiry of the Ministry of the Interior in 1989 gave only 3,689 ethnic Turks and 56,191 Pomaks for the [[Blagoevgrad Province]], it is highly likely that the vast majority of the Turks in the province are actually Pomaks. A similar phenomenon exists in the [[Pazardzhik Province]] where there may be between 10,000 and 15,000 Pomaks.

Finally, there are those Bulgarian Muslims who have chosen not to declare their ethnicity in the 2001 Census {{cn|date=June 2017}}. The percentage of undeclared in the [[Smolyan Province]] (9,696 or 6.9%), the [[Kardzhali Province]] (4,565 or 2.8%) and the [[Blagoevgrad Province]] (4,242 or 1.2%) is well above the national average of 0.8%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These are most likely to be Muslim Bulgarians who would have opted for another ethnicity, for example "Pomak" or "Muslim", if these were allowed as answers at the census or are unclear themselves about their own ethnic identity.

Due to the multitude of different ethnic and religious identities of the Muslim Bulgarians, it is extremely difficult to calculate the exact number of the members of the community in Bulgaria. An inquiry conducted by the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior in 1989 estimated their number at 269,000.&lt;ref name="imir-bg.org"/&gt; A summation of the different groups with different religious and ethnic identities (approximately 130,000 Muslim Bulgarians, approximately 55,000-65,000 non-religious Bulgarians, up to 50,000 Muslim Turks, 15,000 to 20,000 undeclared and an unclear number, probably at least several thousands, of Christian Bulgarians) yields approximately the same number. Despite the multitude of different ethnic and religious affiliations, the predominant ethnic identity would be Bulgarian (approximately 200,000 or three-quarters of the total population) and the predominant religious identity would be Muslim (again approximately 200,000 or three-quarters of the total population). However, if only self-consciousness and self-declaration are taken into consideration, the number of Muslim Bulgarians would be only 131,531, i.e. the ones who have declared as such at the 2001 census.

Muslim Bulgarians in the [[Rhodopes]] speak a variety of archaic [[Bulgarian dialects]]. Under the [[influence of mass media]] and school education, the dialects have been almost completely unified with standard Bulgarian among Muslim Bulgarians living in [[Bulgaria]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13944">'''Buy Quiet''' is an American health and safety initiative to select and purchase the lowest noise emitting [[power tool]]s and [[machine]]ry in order to reduce occupational and community noise exposure. Buy Quiet Programs are examples of [[noise control]] strategies.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preventing Occupational Hearing Loss|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/96-110/pdfs/96-110.pdf|publisher=CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buy Quiet is part of the larger Hearing Loss Prevention Program, and is an example of Prevention Through Design, which seeks to reduce occupational injury through prevention considerations in designs that impact workers.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/background.html|title=CDC - Buy Quiet: Background - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics|publisher=CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations that have embarked upon the buy-quiet initiative are moving towards the creation of an environment and workplace where there will be no harmful noise. Many companies are automating equipment or setting up procedures that can be operated by workers from a quiet control room free from harmful noise, chemical agents, and heat.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; Some of such companies that been recognized for their demonstrated results from  noise control and Buy Quiet initiatives, with a [[Safe-In-Sound Award|Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morata|first=Thais C.|last2=Meinke|first2=Deanna|date=2016-03-09|title=Uncovering Effective Strategies for Hearing Loss Prevention|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40857-016-0044-9|journal=Acoustics Australia|language=en|volume=44|issue=1|pages=67–75|doi=10.1007/s40857-016-0044-9|issn=0814-6039|pmc=4930158|pmid=27397968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of this award are to recognize effective and innovative initiatives, and to share  that information to a broader community.

== Health effects from noise ==
{{Main|Health effects from noise}}

[[Noise-induced hearing loss]] is an irreversible condition that is 100% preventable, and over 30 million US workers are exposed to hazardous noise on the job, which makes them susceptible to noise-induced hearing loss and [[tinnitus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/noise.asp|title=Health Information - NIDCD|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509092930/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/noise.asp|archivedate=2016-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/|title=CDC - Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noise-induced hearing loss]] is also the most common occupational illness in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html|title=CDC - Buy Quiet - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] recommends that workers be exposed to no more than 85&amp;nbsp;dB per eight hours per day.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov1"/&gt;

==The EPA Buy Quiet Program (1970s-80s)==

A formal Buy Quiet program of the late 1970s and early 1980s was a cooperative effort of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), the National Institute of Governmental Purchasing (NIGP), and the [[National League of Cities]] (NLC). This program represented a marked departure from the regulatory approach that the U.S. Government still uses to compel the manufacture and sales of products that are less harmful to human health.&lt;ref name="nonoise.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Noise Control Ordinance Development|url=http://www.nonoise.org/epa/Roll10/roll10doc42.pdf|publisher=No Noise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of regulations, the EPA/NIGP/NLC initiative used the power of high volume procurements by governments at all levels to stimulate a market demand for quiet products. This market-based, incentive-driven approach enabled federal, state, and local governments to purchase quieter products and equipment at competitive prices, by awarding procurements to the lowest "effective bid price”. The effective bid price adjusted the monetary bid price by the sound level of the bidder's equipment in comparison to the average level of all bidders' proposals.&lt;ref name="nonoise.org"/&gt;

Products purchased under this program included construction equipment, lawn and garden equipment, trash trucks/compactors, chain saws, and similar noise generating equipment. The program was part of an initiative to help localities create "quiet communities".  States and localities that participated were encouraged also to promote similar Buy Quiet procurements by private sector organizations in their jurisdictions as a way of "spreading" the market.&lt;ref name="nonoise.org"/&gt;
 
The NIGP/NIGP/NLC Buy Quiet program extended the concepts of "social marketing" to include the creation of markets for socially and environmentally responsible products.  It did this by combining incentivized procurements with the development of a national database of buy quiet purchases available to all interested parties. This database demonstrated that incentivized procurements could achieve quiet products at competitive prices.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hemenway|first=David|title=Government Procurement Leverage |jstor=3342950 | volume=10 | pages=123–125|publisher=Journal of Public Health Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lowest "bid price" was most often the lowest "effective bid price" and quiet products were indicative of high quality and high performing products. The incentive mechanism was also used to purchase low maintenance and low energy products, and is adaptable to other sustainable product initiatives. The Buy Quiet program ended with the dissolution of the Office of Noise Abatement and Control in EPA during the Reagan Administration.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Contemporary Buy Quiet programs==

=== NYC ===
In July 2007, New York City’s [[New York City Department of Environmental Protection|Department of Environmental Protection]] promulgated rules concerning citywide construction [[noise mitigation]].  These new rules reward contractors deploying tools and machinery that use the best available noise control technologies, are designed for quiet, or are known to be the quietest available models of their type. The [[New York City Department of Environmental Protection]] released a products and vendor guidance sheet in order to assist contractors for achieving compliance with the New York City Noise Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Construction Noise Control Products and Vendor Guidance Sheet|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/pdf/construction_guidance.pdf|publisher=New York City Department Of Environmental Protection|date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NASA ===
In 2006, the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) codified a Buy Quiet program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maling|first=George C.|title=International Standards for Specifying Noise Emissions|work=Sound and Vibration|date=December 1, 2013|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-3179348601.html|quote=The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed a roadmap for implementing buy-quiet programs aimed at preventing hearing loss, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is in the process of developing a similar program.|publisher=via HighBeam {{Subscription required}} }} &lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 NASA implemented an online tool called the NASA Buy-Quiet Roadmap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buyquietroadmap.com/buy-quiet-purchasing/|title=Buy-Quiet Purchasing - Buy Quiet Roadmap|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) researchers developed a Buy Quiet prevention initiative intended to facilitate the implementation of Buy Quiet programs for the construction and manufacturing sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet|title=CDC - Buy Quiet - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of this, NIOSH created a searchable database describing noise emission levels of powered hand tools.  The database is called the [[NIOSH Power Tools Database]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Tools Database|url=http://wwwn.cdc.gov/niosh-sound-vibration/|publisher=CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, NIOSH officially launched a [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/ Buy Quiet website] and blog to promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIOSH Rolls-Out Web Resources to Support Buy Quiet Programs|work=Industrial Safety &amp; Hygiene News|date=September 1, 2014|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-401906436.html|publisher=via HighBeam {{Subscription required}} }} &lt;/ref&gt; The initiative also aims to encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niosh Launches Web Resources for Buy Quiet Initiative|work=States News Service|date=July 4, 2014|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-373793547.html|quote=The initiative also provides information about equipment noise levels and encourages manufacturers to design quieter equipment.|publisher=via HighBeam {{Subscription required}} }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The intention of Buy Quiet programs is to reduce the risk of hearing loss at the worksite. Buy Quiet programs seek to minimize the impact of noise on communities and help companies comply with [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] and other noise regulation requirements as well. Additionally, Buy Quiet concepts may reduce the long-term costs of audiometric testing, personal protective equipment, and workers’ compensation. NIOSH suggests Buy Quiet programs contain the following elements:

# An inventory of existing machinery and tools with corresponding noise levels. The company’s purchaser can use the inventory to compare noise levels of equipment before buying or renting.  The inventory can also be used for assisting, tracking, and promoting a company’s Buy Quiet purchases.
# A Buy Quiet company policy or procedure. Policy can be an easy and effective way for employers to show commitment to protecting the hearing and well-being of their employees by using the best equipment available.
# Educational materials and promotional tools. These resources should be designed to help inform employees, management, customers, and the community about the importance and benefits of Buy Quiet. NIOSH has developed a series of posters for public use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/posters.html|title=CDC - Buy Quiet: Posters - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Cost-Benefit Analysis of Buy Quiet programs. The quieter piece of equipment may be the least expensive when all life cycle costs of the machinery, possible workers’ compensation claims, costs associated with a company’s hearing conservation program, costs of healthcare (such as hearing aids), and lost productivity are counted. NIOSH estimates a savings of $100 per decibel reduced when purchasing a quieter machine.

{{Wiktionary|cabal}}

A '''cabal''' is a small group of people united in some close design, usually to promote their private views of or interests in an ideology, [[state (polity)|state]], or other community, often by [[Wiktionary:intrigue|intrigue]] and usually unbeknownst to those outside their group. The use of this term usually carries negative connotations of political purpose, conspiracy and secrecy.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cabal|title=Collins English Dictionary: Cabal|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wordpandit.com/cabal/|title=Wordpandit: Cabal|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also refer to a secret plot, or a [[clique]] of people, or may be used as a verb (to form a cabal or to conspire secretly).&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''cabal'' derives from [[Kabbalah|Cabala]] (a word that has numerous spelling variations), the [[Jewish mysticism|Jewish mystical]] interpretation of the Hebrew scripture. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] it means "reception" or "tradition", denoting the ''sod'' (secret) level of [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Jewish exegesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/kabbalah.htm|title=Judaism 101: Kabbalah and Jewish Mysticism|website=www.jewfaq.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In European culture ([[Christian Cabala]], [[Hermetic Qabalah]]) it became associated with [[occult]] doctrine or a [[secret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60664380|title=Kabbalah : a very short introduction|last=Dan|first=Joseph|page=67|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195327052|location=New York, NY|oclc=60664380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It came into English via the French ''cabale'' from the medieval Latin ''cabbala'', and was known early in the 17th century through usages linked to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]]. By the middle of the 17th century it had developed further to mean some intrigue entered into by a small group and also referred to the group of people so involved, i.e. a semi-secret political clique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-cab1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Cabal|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501021445/http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-cab1.htm|archive-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a theory that the term took on its present meaning from a group of ministers formed in 1668 - the "[[Cabal ministry]]" of King [[Charles II of England]]. Members included [[Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh|Sir Thomas Clifford]], [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], the [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Ashley]], and [[John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale|Lord Lauderdale]], whose initial letters coincidentally spelled CABAL, and who were the signatories of the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]] that allied [[England]] to [[France]] in a prospective war against the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will and Ariel.  ''The Age of Louis XIV.'' (page 277) New York: Simon And Schuster, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory that the word originated as an [[acronym]] from the names of the group of ministers is a [[folk etymology]], although the coincidence was noted at the time and could possibly have popularized its use.&lt;ref name=HCG&gt;{{Cite book|title=Europe: Its Influence on South Africa|last=Girdlestone|first=Henry Clapcott|page=178|edition=11th impression, revised &amp; enlarged by Cecil Lewis|date=1926|publisher=Juta &amp; Co.|location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jersey]] is a state in which [[capital punishment]] has been abolished.

==History==
Until the 19th century, hangings were carried out on Westmount ({{lang-fr|Mont-Patibulaire}} (gallows hill); ''[[Jèrriais]]'': Mont ès Pendus (hill of the hanged men)) in [[Saint Helier]]. The last such execution was carried out on 3 October 1829, when Philippe Jolin was hanged for murder.

The following execution, that of François Bradley on 11 October 1866, was carried out in public outside the prison in Saint Helier. The law specified hanging in public until 1907. The next execution, therefore, that of Joseph Philip Le Brun on 12 August 1875, also took place under the same conditions. It was the last public hanging in the British Isles (the United Kingdom had [[Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868|abolished public hangings in 1868]]).

The death sentence passed on Thomas Connan (executed 19 February 1907) necessitated a law change to permit the hanging to take place within the prison walls.  During the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|German Occupation 1940-1945]], the occupying forces carried out executions by firing squad.  The last execution in Jersey was on 9 October 1959, when [[Francis Joseph Huchet]] was hanged for murder.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004025704/http://www.richard.clark32.btinternet.co.uk/islands.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jersey, the last death sentence was passed in 1984, but was commuted to life imprisonment.

==Abolition==

Capital punishment was abolished by the Homicide (Jersey) Law 1986 in relation to the offence of murder and by the Genocide (Amendment) (Jersey) Law 1987 in relation to the offence of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/search/index.aspx?Target%3DStates+Assembly+Search%26Action%3DShowDocument%26Data%3D1%26Page%3D0 |accessdate=October 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927015106/http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/search/index.aspx?Target=States%20Assembly%20Search&amp;Action=ShowDocument&amp;Data=1&amp;Page=0 |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, the death penalty remained available to a military court, but by the 1986 and 1987 laws the Royal Court of Jersey lost the power of capital sentencing. References to capital punishment in obsolete laws were formally removed by the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) (Jersey) Law 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fhtm%2fLawFiles%2f2007%2fL-34-2007.htm |title=Jersey Law &amp;#124; CRIMINAL JUSTICE (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) (NO. 2) (JERSEY) LAW 2007 |publisher=Jerseylaw.je |date=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Human Rights (Amendment) (Jersey) Order 2006''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerseylegalinfo.je/Law/lawsinforce/htm/ROFiles/R&amp;OYear2006/R&amp;O-115-2006.pdf |title=Human Rights (Amendment) (Jersey) Order 2006 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227025455/http://www.jerseylegalinfo.je/Law/lawsinforce/htm/ROFiles/R%26OYear2006/R%26O-115-2006.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; amends the ''Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerseylegalinfo.je/law/lawsinforce/consolidated/15/15.350_HumanRightsLaw2000_RevisedEdition_1January2007.pdf |title=Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227025458/http://www.jerseylegalinfo.je/law/lawsinforce/consolidated/15/15.350_HumanRightsLaw2000_RevisedEdition_1January2007.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to give effect to the 13th Protocol of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] providing for the total abolition of the death penalty. Both of these laws came into effect on 10 December 2006.

'''Crime in Greece''' is combated by the [[Greek Police]] and other agencies. For much of the 20th century, the security forces were criticized for spending their time chasing people with left-wing political views, instead of focusing on actual crime. The crime rate in Greece has historically been amongst the lowest in Western Europe, and continues to be.

During the 1980s, Greek Police Chief Nikon Arkoudeas (Νίκων Αρκουδέας) led an intense campaign against organized crime which saw significant success. Since the early 1990s, many [[Immigration to Greece|illegal immigrants have come to Greece]] from Central and Eastern European countries, Asia and the Middle East. Their sudden arrival contributed to an increase in criminal activities throughout the 1990s and 2000s.

The Greek Police also had several victories, breaking up mafia organizations, arresting the [[Revolutionary Organization 17 November|17 November terrorist group]], successfully organizing security for the [[2004 Olympic Games]] and for breaking up in 2016 the largest criminal organization in the country, responsible for more than 2.000 robberies.

===Organized crime===
{{See also|Greek mafia}}

Organized crime in Greece is on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkanalysis.com/greece/2011/05/15/organized-crime-in-greece-statistics-trends-and-police-countermeasures-in-2011-2/&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic as well as foreign criminal groups are well-entrenched in Greek society. Traditionally, people associated with organized crime were known as ''Men of the night'' (άνθρωποι της νύχτας).
Out of the foreign criminal groups the [[Albanian mafia]] is the most prevalent. The activities of the Albanian crime groups in Greece include [[drug trafficking]], [[human trafficking]], [[extortion]] and [[robbery]] among others.

Albanian criminal groups often extort other immigrants to Greece, especially Middle Eastern and Pakistani shopkeepers, and control many nightclubs in the working-class districts of West Athens. Russian groups are less numerous, but they are very heavily armed and dangerous; they are involved in [[arms trafficking]], extortion and cigarette smuggling. Lower-level Romanian and Moldavian groups are involved in theft and human trafficking.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{&lt;!-EXISTING REFERENCE-&gt;|archive-url=
https://web.archive.org/web/20131030024423/http://www.flarenetwork.org/media/files/echo2_oc-and-drugs-in-greece.pdf |archive-date=2013-10-30|access-date=2016-8-11|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic, ethnic [[Greek people|Greek]] criminal organizations are the most powerful and politically well-connected and extensively cooperate with Albanian groups, often hiring Albanians to act as enforcers. Greek criminal organizations are involved in [[human trafficking]], [[extortion]], [[drug trafficking]], [[kidnapping]] and the infiltration of legal businesses. They have profited from the rising corruption. That is evident in the fact that Greek crime groups have infiltrated the shipping industry, which is used to traffic [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]] into the Greek mainland and abroad.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

=== Property crime ===
As of 2011, Greece has seen an increase in property-related crime, thought to be linked to the worsening of economic conditions.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-16/greece-crime-wave-spells-boom-for-security-firms-in-sovereign-debt-crisis.html | work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robberies, ranging from street muggings to bank hold-ups and house burglaries, totaled about 80,000 in 2009, up from about 50,000 in 2005.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"/&gt; The increase in property crime has seen an increase in the amount of work for private security companies.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"/&gt; Nevertheless, the crime rate is still among the lowest in Western Europe. 

In 2016, the Greek police successfully broke up the country's largest criminal organization in Greece's history, which was responsible for more than 2.000 house burglaries across the country, in an operation where at least 1.000 policemen and 37 judges participated.

=== Immigrant crime ===
{{Further|Immigration to Greece}}

Official statistics show that immigrants are responsible for about half of the criminal activity in Greece.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-19269891  "Greeks confront crime wave amid austerity", Chloe Hadjimatheou, BBC News, Athens, 16 August 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek police have admitted that armed gangs entering the country from neighbouring Albania or Bulgaria could have been attracted by reports that many people have been withdrawing cash from banks and stashing it in their homes.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; There are possibly more than 1 million illegal immigrants inside Greece as of 2012.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="migrationinformation.org"&gt;[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=884  "Greece: Illegal Immigration in the Midst of Crisis", Charalambos Kasimis, Agricultural University of Athens, March 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cases of immigrant crime such as the [[2012 Paros (Greece) rape|2012 Paros rape]] have attracted nationwide interest.

Illegal immigration to Greece has increased rapidly over the past several years. Tough immigration policies in Spain and Italy and agreements with their neighboring African countries to combat illegal immigration have changed the direction of African immigration flows toward Greece. At the same time, flows from Asia and the Middle East — mainly Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Bangladesh — to Greece appear to have increased as well.&lt;ref name="migrationinformation.org"/&gt;

The evidence now indicates that nearly all illegal immigration to the European Union flows through the country's porous borders. In 2010, 90 percent of all apprehensions for unauthorized entry into the European Union took place in Greece, compared to 75 percent in 2009 and 50 percent in 2008.&lt;ref name="migrationinformation.org"/&gt;

In 2010, 132,524 persons were arrested for "illegal entry or stay" in Greece, a sharp increase from 95,239 in 2006. Nearly half of those arrested (52,469) were immediately deported, the majority of them being Albanians.&lt;ref name="migrationinformation.org"/&gt;

=== Tax evasion and corruption ===
{{Main article|Tax evasion and corruption in Greece}}

Greece suffers from relatively high levels of [[tax evasion]] and [[political corruption]], even though in recents years there has been considerable decrease.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;Inman, Phillip (9 September 2012) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/09/greece-tax-evasion-professional-classes?CMP=twt_gu Primary Greek tax evaders are the professional classes] The Guardian. Retrieved 6 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethnos Forodiafygi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22770&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=29345 |script-title=el:Πτώση της φοροδιαφυγής στο 41,6% από 49% το τελευταίο εξάμηνο |year=2006 |publisher=Ethnos |accessdate=12 October 2011|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to the extent that tax evasion has been described by Greek politicians as "a national sport" - with up to €30 billion per year going uncollected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21565657-greek-tax-dodgers-are-being-outed-national-sport-no-more | work=The Economist | title=A national sport no more | date=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Extent of Greek tax evasion ====
The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] estimated in August 2009 that the size of the Greek [[black market]] to be around €65bn (equal to 25% of GDP), resulting each year in €20bn of unpaid taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/international/500632/index.do |newspaper=Die Presse |title=Korruption und Steuerhinterziehung: Griechenland versinkt im Sumpf|date=5 August 2009|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a European record in relative terms, and in comparison almost twice as big as the German black market (estimated to be 15% of GDP).&lt;ref name="Fakelaki"&gt;{{cite web|title=Griechenland: Abkehr von den Fakelaki|url=http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2010-05/griechenland-korruption-schwarzarbeit?page=all |publisher=zeit.de|date=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several successive Greek governments had in the past attempted to improve the situation, but all failed due to tax evasion's place within Greek culture. A rapid increase in government revenues through implementing a more effective tax collecting system has been recommended. Implementing the proper reforms, is however estimated to be a slow process, requiring at least two legislative periods before they start to work.&lt;ref name="Fakelaki"/&gt;

In the last quarter of 2005, participation in tax evasion reached an estimated 49% of the population,&lt;ref name="Ethnos Forodiafygi"/&gt; while in January 2006 it fell to 41.6%.&lt;ref name="Ethnos Forodiafygi" /&gt; A study by researchers from the [[University of Chicago]] concluded that tax evasion in 2009 by self-employed professionals alone in Greece (accountants, dentists, lawyers, doctors, personal tutors and independent financial advisers) was €28 billion or 31% of the budget deficit that year.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;

The [[Tax Justice Network]] has said that there are over €20 billion in [[Switzerland|Swiss]] bank accounts held by Greeks.&lt;ref name="Skai TJN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/finance/article/182717/20-dis-euro-ehoun-krupsei-oi-ellines-stin-elvetia/ |title=20 δισ. ευρώ έχουν κρύψει οι Έλληνες στην Ελβετία |year=2011  |publisher=[[Skai TV]] |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former Finance Minister of Greece, Evangelos Venizelos, was quoted as saying "Around 15,000 individuals and companies owe the taxman 37 billion euros".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyes|first=Roger|title=Rich greeks pack up their troubles along with their euros|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the TJN puts the number of Greek-owned [[Offshore investment|off-shore companies]] to over 10,000.&lt;ref name="Ta Nea TJN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tanea.gr/ellada/article/?aid=4515967 |script-title=el:Υπερδύναμη στις οφ σορ η Ελλάδα |year=2011  |publisher=[[Ta Nea]] |accessdate=12 October 2011|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Athens ===
Armed robberies in [[Athens]] doubled between 2007 and 2009; however, Athens is still among the safest capitals in Europe.&lt;ref name="Carassava"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-greece-austerity-20110531,0,4755541.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Anthee | last=Carassava | title=Crime casts long shadow over Athens | date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thefts and break-ins jumped from 26,872 recorded cases in 2007, to 47,607 in 2009.&lt;ref name="Carassava"/&gt; The number of murders in Athens nearly doubled between 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref name="Carassava"/&gt; The Greek Police has responded that it often finds its work hindered by NGOs, who tend to interfere with police procedure, advocate small penalties for criminals and spread false rumors of police brutality {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}.

== Police politics==
One of the major criticisms addressed to the Greek Police by the Greek media is the politicization of its officer corps. Up until 1981 (when [[Andreas Papandreou]] and his [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] party came to power), almost all senior officers of the [[Greek Gendarmerie]] and the [[Cities Police]] were dyed-in-the-wool conservative right-wingers. These two agencies were merged in 1984 to create the Greek Police.

It is not uncommon for officers to seek the patronage of a political party, and "cliques" have been formed inside the force, sometimes with a regional basis; for example, most Generals usually originate from the [[Peloponnese]] or from [[Crete]].

===Murder===
{{Further information|List of countries by intentional homicide rate|List of Russian federal subjects by murder rate}}

In 2016, the murder rate in Russia was 7 per 100,000 &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/doc_2017/rusfig/rus17e.pdf &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; people, according to Rosstat, also known as the [[Russian Federal State Statistics Service]]. According to UNODC, the corresponding figure is a bit higher at 9.2.[https://dataunodc.un.org/crime/intentional-homicide-victims &lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[2]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;] Either way, it represents a significant decrease over the previous 15 years (in 2001, the homicide rate was 30.5). In the first quarter of 2018, murder rate in Russia fell by 15% year-over-year; and if the trend continues for the rest of the year, the murder rate will be below that of the United States (5.3 per 100,000 in 2016) for the first time in recent history.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fedstat.ru/indicator/33559?#&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Moscow also recorded the lowest crime rate in over a decade.&lt;sup&gt;[https://themoscowtimes.com/news/moscow-crime-rate-hits-decade-low-prosecutors-say-60472 &lt;nowiki&gt;[3]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;   

At the beginning of the 20th century, Russia had a higher [[homicide]] rate – nearly ten per 100,000 people per year.&lt;ref name="RR121"&gt;{{cite book

===Arms trafficking===
[[Arms trafficking]] has become a significant problem in the Russian Federation following the disintegration of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="EERCA62"/&gt; The former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries (including Russia) are the source of the majority of illegal weapons in circulation around the world.&lt;ref name=CDIISWFWAW&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/russia/162.html##10 Illegal Soviet Weapons Fuel Wars Around World] ''[[Center for Defense Information]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Illegal arms possession is a problem in many regions in the nation, especially in the areas suffering from insurgency such as [[Chechnya]] and [[Dagestan]].&lt;ref name=SMALLARMSSURVEY&gt;[http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/files/sas/publications/o_papers_pdf/2003-op10-russia.pdf Beyond the Kalashnikov: Small Arms Production, Exports, and Stockpiles in the Russian Federation] ''Small Arms Survey''&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the general weakening of the government control and the decentralization of power in the nation in the first half of the 1990s, small arms from several military units and arsenals made their way into the hands of civilians and local unofficial armed formations.&lt;ref name=SMALLARMSSURVEY/&gt; Gunrunning in Russia stemmed from corruption in the [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|armed forces]] and the illegal sale of military equipment.&lt;ref name="EERCA62"/&gt; It has been suggested that parts of the [[Russian Ministry of Defence|Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation]] and [[arms industry]] were engaged in arms trafficking with the Chechen separatists.&lt;ref name="MCWPC191"&gt;{{cite book

There have been accusations and counter-accusations between Russia and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] regarding illegal arms selling to Chechen separatists. Russia alleged that Chechen separatists received weapons through illegal networks going to Chechnya through Georgia and [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name="BSRCSB231"&gt;{{cite book

The types of firearms in illegal possession varies throughout the nation: in [[Siberia]] unregistered [[Hunting weapon#Rifles|hunting rifles]] are the primarily found illegal weapons while in Chechnya the predominant illicit arms are illegally held military weapons.&lt;ref name=SMALLARMSSURVEY/&gt; Small arms are illegally proliferated from the main centers of small arms manufacturing, [[Tula Oblast|Tula]] and [[Izhevsk]].&lt;ref name=SMALLARMSSURVEY/&gt; In 2003 an estimated 300,000 to 1.5 million illegal arms were in circulation within Russia.&lt;ref name=SMALLARMSSURVEY/&gt;

According to the statistics from the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]], 1.5 times more people were arrested for gunrunning in 2001 than in 2000; in total 26,113 arrests were made and 65,000 crimes were committed using illegal arms.&lt;ref name="EERCA62"/&gt; In 2000, the number of seized unregistered firearms was 300,000, which was a 37% increase compared with 1999.&lt;ref name="EERCA62"/&gt; Many Russian criminal organizations, aside from arms trafficking in Russia, provide weapons to the separatists groups in [[Chechnya]].&lt;ref name="PC165"/&gt;

However several attempts were made to combat arms trafficking. Small arms manufacturers in the country have tightened their security systems.&lt;ref name=SMALLARMSSURVEY/&gt; Special prosecutors’ offices, which were originally set up in the 1950s for supervising secrecy in nuclear facilities, have been given the responsibility of the security of defense plants and curbing the theft of small arms from the plants.&lt;ref name=SMALLARMSSURVEY/&gt; The [[Government of Russia]] has undertaken a programme to increase security at arms storage facilities at military bases.&lt;ref name=SMALLARMSSURVEY/&gt;

*Poaching of the tiger's prey base (i.e. wild pig and deer) occur for the consumption of the local population.&lt;ref name="SWT360"/&gt;
*The poachers generally sell the tiger parts to middlemen operating out of the cities like [[Vladivostok]], [[Khabarovsk]], [[Ussuriysk]], [[Nakhodka]] and [[Plastun (urban-type settlement)|Plastun]].&lt;ref name="SWT360"/&gt;
*The middlemen who buy or sell tiger parts are generally [[Russians]], [[Koryo-saram|ethnic Koreans]], or [[Chinese people in Russia|Chinese]].&lt;ref name="SWT360"/&gt;
*Most tiger parts are being smuggled to the [[People's Republic of China]], [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="SWT360"/&gt;

It is believed that sharp increase in poaching in the first half of the 1990s resulted in rapid decrease of the [[Siberian tiger]] population.&lt;ref name="PWCC305"&gt;{{cite book

Political analyst [[Andrei Piontkovsky]] said in an article written in early 2000 that the then current political system in Russia was "the highest stage of robber [[capitalism]]”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/4094.html#1 Putinism: highest stage of robber capitalism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711235241/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/4094.html#1#1 |date=2007-07-11 }}, by [[Andrei Piontkovsky]], The Russia Journal, February 7–13, 2000. The title is an allusion to work ''"[[Imperialism]] as the last and culminating stage of capitalism"'' by [[Vladimir Lenin]]&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that "Russia is not corrupt. [[Political corruption|Corruption]] is what happens in all countries when businessmen offer officials large bribes for favors. Today’s Russia is unique. The businessmen, the politicians, and the bureaucrats are the same people.

Such views are also shared by former [[CIA]] director [[James Woolsey]] who said in a 1999 Congressional Statement: "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian [[organized crime]], Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business. I have often illustrated this point with the following hypothetical: If you should chance to strike up a conversation with an articulate, English-speaking Russian in, say, the restaurant of one of the luxury hotels along Lake Geneva, and he is wearing a $3,000 suit and a pair of Gucci loafers, and he tells you that he is an executive of a Russian trading company and wants to talk to you about a joint venture, then there are four possibilities. He may be what he says he is. He may be a Russian intelligence officer working under commercial cover. He may be part of a Russian organized crime group. But the really interesting possibility is that he may be all three and that none of those three institutions have any problem with the arrangement." &lt;ref&gt;(''Congressional Statement of R. James Woolsey, Former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, 21 September 1999, Hearing on the Bank of New York and Russian Money Laundering'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Takeover"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08850600500483699 The Chekist Takeover of the Russian State], Anderson, Julie (2006), International Journal of Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence, 19:2, 237 - 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparison of the crime rates of the [[Soviet Union]] with those of other nations is considered difficult, because the Soviet Union did not publish comprehensive crime statistics.&lt;ref name=LOCCS&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ru0209) Crime in the Soviet Era] ''Federal Research Division'', ''[[Library of Congress]]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Western experts, robberies, homicide and other violent crimes were less prevalent in the Soviet Union than in the [[United States]] because the Soviet Union had a larger police force, strict gun controls, and had a low occurrence of [[drug abuse]].&lt;ref name=LOCCS/&gt; However, [[white-collar crime]] was prevalent in the Soviet system. Corruption in the form of bribery was common, primarily due to the paucity of goods and services on the open market.&lt;ref name=LOCCS/&gt;

Theft of state property (embezzlement) by state employees was also common.&lt;ref name=LOCCS/&gt; When [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] was the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the CPSU]], an effort was made to stop white-collar crime.&lt;ref name=LOCCS/&gt; Revelations of corruption scandals involving high-level employees of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] were published regularly in the [[news media]] of the Soviet Union, and many arrests and prosecutions resulted from such discoveries.&lt;ref name=LOCCS/&gt; An article published in the ''[[Izvestia]]'' in 1994 described the difference between the situation of crime in the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia:&lt;ref name="CRS135136"&gt;{{cite book

==Crime dynamics==

=== 1990s ===
Russia's economy experienced a 40% GDP decline in the 1990s, &lt;sup&gt;[https://www.thenation.com/article/harvard-boys-do-russia/ &lt;nowiki&gt;[3]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; and this led to an explosion of crime. In 1990, the number of registered crime was 1.84 million.&lt;ref name="HRRDSR35" /&gt; This figure increased to 2.8 million in 1993, then fell slightly.&lt;ref name="HRRDSR35" /&gt; In 1996, there were a total of 2.63 million officially registered crimes, which was more than 40% higher than in 1990.&lt;ref name="HRRDSR35" /&gt; In 1999, total reported crime was 3 million, and it continued to increase in 2000 and 2001, and then fell in 2002.&lt;ref name="HRRDSR35" /&gt;

Among white-collar crimes, swindling increased 67.2 percent, and extortion 37.5 percent, in 1995.&lt;ref name="LOCCS" /&gt; Among the conventional crimes reported in 1995, homicide and attempted murder increased 1.5%, rape 6.5%, burglaries 6.6%.&lt;ref name="LOCCS" /&gt; Serious crimes by teenagers increased by 2.2 percent in 1995.&lt;ref name="LOCCS" /&gt;

In the first four months in 1994, Russia averaged eighty-four murders per day.&lt;ref name=LOCCS/&gt; Many of those crimes were contract killings by criminal organizations.&lt;ref name=LOCCS/&gt; The 1995 national crime total exceeded 1.3 million, including 30,600 cases of homicide.&lt;ref name=LOCCS/&gt;

=== Recent Years ===
The Putin years (2001-now) have seen substantial decrease in crime -- for example, the number of murders and suicides in Russia is stated to have been dropped by 80%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/doc_2017/rusfig/rus17e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By region ===

{{Further information|List of Russian federal subjects by murder rate}}

2017 was a very good year for Moscow, which saw the lowest number of crimes (140,000) in a decade. &lt;sup&gt;[http://tass.ru/moskva/4943699 &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Theft, burglary and armed robbery dropped up to 38 percent since the previous year, while the murder rate dropped by 10 percent. Crime statistics of Moscow for 1995 included a total of 93,560 cases of crime, of which 18,500 were [[white-collar crime]]s, an increase of 8.3% over 1994.&lt;ref name="LOCCS 0210"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ru0210)|title=Crime Statistics|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of car thefts were reported from [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]], which increased through the first half of the 1990s.&lt;ref name=LOCCS/&gt; In Moscow an estimated fifty cars were stolen per day, with the estimated yearly total for Russia between 100,000 and 150,000.&lt;ref name=LOCCS/&gt;

=== Alcohol and crime ===

{{See also|Alcoholism in Russia}}

In the early 1980s, an estimated "two-thirds of murders and violent crimes were committed by intoxicated persons; and drunk drivers were responsible for 14,000 traffic deaths and 60,000 serious traffic injuries".&lt;ref name=Dorman&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dorman |first1=Nancy D. |last2=Towle |first2=Leland H. |year=1991 |title=Initiatives to curb alcohol abuse and alcoholism in the former Soviet Union |journal=Alcohol Health &amp; Research World |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0847/is_n4_v15/ai_12754655/?tag=content;col1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, about three quarters of those arrested for homicide were under the influence of alcohol.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e88757.pdf |title=Interpersonal Violence and Alcohol in the Russian Federation |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |year=2006 |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1997 report published in the ''Journal of Family Violence'', found that among male perpetrators of spousal homicide, 60–75% of offenders had been drinking prior to the incident.&lt;ref name="WHO p4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e88757.pdf |title=Interpersonal Violence and Alcohol in the Russian Federation |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |year=2006 |accessdate=May 12, 2010| page =4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2004 study of domestic violence in the [[Central Black Earth Region]] of Russia, 77% of offenders of violent crime towards family members were frequent drinkers - 12% engaged in regular binge drinking three or four times a month, 30% three times a week or more, and 35% every day or almost every day.&lt;ref name="WHO p4"/&gt;

Homicide/murder rate in Russia has fallen dramatically in the last two decades.

In [[medicine]] and [[medical anthropology]], a '''culture-bound syndrome''', '''culture-specific syndrome''', or '''folk illness''' is a combination of psychiatric and somatic [[symptom]]s that are considered to be a recognizable disease only within a specific society or [[culture]]. There are no objective biochemical or structural alterations of [[organ (anatomy)|body organs]] or functions, and the disease is not recognized in other cultures. The term ''culture-bound syndrome'' was included in the fourth version of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[American Psychiatric Association]], 1994) which also includes a list of the most common culture-bound conditions ([[DSM-IV]]: Appendix I). Counterpart within the framework of [[ICD-10]] ([[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders|Chapter V]]) are the ''culture-specific disorders'' defined in Annex 2 of the ''Diagnostic criteria for research''.&lt;ref name="ICD10Diag"&gt;[http://www.who.int/entity/classifications/icd/en/GRNBOOK.pdf Diagnostic criteria for research], p. 213–225 ([[World Health Organization|WHO]] 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, an [[epidemic]] that can be attributed to cultural behavior patterns or [[suggestion]] is sometimes referred to as a '''behavioral epidemic'''. As in the cases of [[drug abuse|drug]] or [[alcohol abuse|alcohol]] abuse or smoking, [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] can be determined by [[communal reinforcement]] as well as by person-to-person interactions. On [[etiological]] grounds, it can be difficult to distinguish the causal contribution of culture in disease from other [[environmental factor]]s such as [[toxicity]].&lt;ref name=Porta-2008&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor=Porta, Miquel |encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Epidemiology| edition=5th | title=Behavioral epidemic | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7R-MLMyEgwC&amp;pg=PT48|accessdate=25 August 2013| year=2008| publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-157844-1|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification==

A culture-specific syndrome is characterized by:{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}
# categorization as a [[disease]] in the culture (i.e., not a voluntary behaviour or false claim);
# widespread familiarity in the culture;
# complete lack of familiarity or misunderstanding of the condition to people in other cultures;
# no objectively demonstrable biochemical or tissue abnormalities (signs);
# the condition is usually recognized and treated by the [[folk medicine]] of the culture.

Some culture-specific syndromes involve somatic symptoms (pain or disturbed function of a body part), while others are purely behavioral. Some culture-bound syndromes appear with similar features in several cultures, but with locally specific traits, such as [[penis panic]]s.

A culture-specific syndrome is not the same as a geographically localized disease with specific, identifiable, causal tissue abnormalities, such as [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]] or [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], or genetic conditions limited to certain populations. It is possible that a condition originally assumed to be a culture-bound behavioral syndrome is found to have a biological cause; from a medical perspective it would then be redefined into another [[nosology|nosological]] category.

==Medical perspectives==
The American Psychiatric Association states the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  | author = American Psychiatric Association
  | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., text revision
  | publisher = American Psychiatric Pub
  | year = 2000
  | page = 898
  | isbn = 978-0-89042-025-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The term ''culture-bound syndrome'' denotes recurrent, locality-specific patterns of aberrant behavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a particular DSM-IV diagnostic category. Many of these patterns are indigenously considered to be "illnesses," or at least afflictions, and most have local names. Although presentations conforming to the major DSM-IV categories can be found throughout the world, the particular symptoms, course, and social response are very often influenced by local cultural factors. In contrast, culture-bound syndromes are generally limited to specific societies or culture areas and are localized, folk, diagnostic categories that frame coherent meanings for certain repetitive, patterned, and troubling sets of experiences and observations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term ''culture-bound syndrome'' is controversial since it reflects the different opinions of anthropologists and psychiatrists.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, S. (2012, 13 January). [http://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/01/controversy-over-culture-bound-mental-illnesses The controversy over 'culture-bound' mental illnesses]. Retrieved 27 January 2013 from MinnPost.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists have a tendency to emphasize the relativistic and culture-specific dimensions of the syndromes, while physicians tend to emphasize the universal and neuropsychological dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Raymond H. (2000) ''In Review. Transcultural Psychiatry: Personal Experiences and Canadian Perspectives''. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 45: 431–437&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jilek W.G (2001) ''Psychiatric Disorders: Culture-specific''. International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences. Elsevier Science Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Guarnaccia &amp; Rogler (1999) have argued in favor of investigating culture-bound syndromes on their own terms, and believe that the syndromes have enough cultural integrity to be treated as independent objects of research.&lt;ref&gt;Guarnaccia, Peter J. &amp; Rogler, Lloyd H. (1999) ''Research on Culture-Bound Syndromes: New Directions''. American Journal of Psychiatry 156:1322–1327, September&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies suggest that culture-bound syndromes represent an acceptable way within a specific culture (and cultural context) among certain vulnerable individuals (i.e. an ''[[ataque de nervios]]'' at a funeral in Puerto Rico) to express distress in the wake of a traumatic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Marshall RD, Salman E, Goetz D, Davies SO, Liebowitz MR (2000). Ataque de nervios and childhood trauma history: An association? Journal of Traumatic Stress, 13:3, 529–534.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar manifestation of distress when displaced into a North American medical culture may lead to a very different, even adverse outcome for a given individual and [his or] her family.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Kaminer, T, Grienenberger JF, Amat J (2003). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2078527/ Fits and starts: A mother-infant case study involving pseudoseizures across three generations in the context of violent trauma history] (with Commentaries by RD Marshall, CH Zeanah, T Gaensbauer).

==Other examples==
Within the contiguous United States,  the consumption of [[kaolin]] has been proposed as a culture-bound syndrome observed in African Americans in the rural south, particularly in areas in which the mining of kaolin is common.&lt;ref&gt;South Med J. 1999;Feb 92 (2): 190-192. Chalk Eating in Middle Georgia: A Culture-Bound Syndrome of Pica? Grigsby, RK, Thyer, BA, Waller, RJ, Johnston, GA Jr&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, among the [[Xhosa people]], the syndrome [[amafufunyana]] is commonly used to describe those believed to be possessed by demons or other malevolent spirits. Traditional healers in the culture usually perform exorcisms in order to drive off these spirits. Upon investigating the phenomenon, researchers found that many of the people claimed to be affected by the syndrome exhibited the traits and characteristics of [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Niehaus DJ, Oosthuizen P, Lochner C, Emsley RA, Jordaan E, Mbanga NI, Keyter N, Laurent C, Deleuze JF, Stein DJ |date=March–April 2004 |title=A culture-bound syndrome 'amafufunyana' and a culture-specific event 'ukuthwasa': differentiated by a family history of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders |journal=[[Psychopathology (journal)|Psychopathology]] |publisher=[[Karger Publishers]] |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=59–63 |doi=10.1159/000077579 |pmid=15057028 }}]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vegetative-vascular dystonia]] can be considered an example of somatic condition formally recognised by local medical community in former Soviet Union countries, but not in Western classification systems. Its [[umbrella term]] nature as neurological condition also results in diagnosing neurotic patients as neurological ones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mikhaylov, B |date=2010 |title= P02-34 -Statistical issues of the psychiatric care in Ukraine |url=http://www.europsy-journal.com/article/S0924-9338(10)70647-7/abstract |journal=European Psychiatry|volume=25|pages=652  |doi=10.1016/S0924-9338(10)70647-7 |accessdate=October 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA-1025 - Integrative psychotherapy model of anxiety disorders Mykhaylov, B. et al.

Refugee children in Sweden have been known to fall into coma-like states on learning their families will be deported. The condition, known as Uppgivenhetssyndrom, or [[Resignation Syndrome|resignation syndrome]] is believed to only exist among the refugee population in the Scandinavian country, where it has been prevalent since the early part of the 21st Century. In a hundred-and-thirty-page report on the condition, commissioned by the government and published in 2006, a team of psychologists, political scientists, and sociologists hypothesized that it was a culture-bound syndrome, a psychological illness endemic to a specific society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/the-trauma-of-facing-deportation|title=The Trauma of Facing Deportation|author=Rachel Aviv|date=April 3, 2017|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quote: «''A great scholar of the Silla Dynasty Choe Chi-weon (857-? A.D.), naturally wrote that Dangunism (Dae-jong-Gyo), a religious teaching indigenous to Korea, embraces the essential teachings of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism.''»&lt;/ref&gt; is the name of a number of religious movements within the framework of [[Korean shamanism]], focused on the worship of [[Dangun]] (or Tangun). There are around seventeen of these groups, the main one of which was founded in [[Seoul]] in 1909 by Na Cheol ([[:ko:나철|나철]], 1864-1916).&lt;ref name=religions/&gt;&lt;ref name=koreas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://preview.britannica.co.kr/bol/topic.asp?article_id=b03n2772a 한국브리태니커 온라인 - 나철] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140918143841/http://preview.britannica.co.kr/bol/topic.asp?article_id=b03n2772a |date=2014-09-18 }} Encyclopædia Britannica online Korea 'Na Cheol'&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangunists believe their [[myth]]os to be the authentic Korean [[native religion]], that was already around as ''Gosindo'' (古神道, "way of the Ancestral God" or "ancient way of God") at the time of the first [[Mongol invasions of Korea]], and that was revived as "Daejongism" (''Daejonggyo'') just at the start of the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; The religion was suppressed during the Japanese rule.&lt;ref name="Lee Chi-ran, p. 12"&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The religion believes in one God manifested in three persons,&lt;ref name="Baker (2007a), p. 464."&gt;Baker (2007a), p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt; whose earthly incarnation was the legendary king [[Dangun]], who ruled over a Korean empire around 5000 years ago.&lt;ref name=religions/&gt; Its main tenet is that the Koreans have their own God and they have no need to worship foreign gods.&lt;ref name=spirituality/&gt; Its emphasis is on the national identity and unity of the [[Korean people]] (known as ''[[wiktionary:민족|minjok]]'') and as such has been associated with [[Korean nationalism]] (and sometimes ultranationalism).&lt;ref name=empires/&gt;{{rp|193}}

Daejongism does not focus so much on institutions or rituals but rather on central doctrines and associated mythologies, so that it is more definable as a creed or a faith system rather than an organized religion. In the decade of 1910-1920, it had its major growth, reaching an estimated following of 400,000.&lt;ref name="Lee Gyungwon, p. 54."&gt;Lee  Gyungwon, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity was largely due to its efforts on behalf of Korean independence. Once this aim was achieved, its membership declined, although Daejongism acquired a reputation for its educational and scholarly institutions, which published in particular monumental works about Korea's struggle for independence and Daejongism's contribution to it.&lt;ref name="Lee Gyungwon, p. 67."&gt;Lee  Gyungwon, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1995 census found that fewer than 10,000 Koreans claimed to follow the religion.,&lt;ref name=koreas&gt;{{cite book|last=Connor|first=Mary E.|title=The Koreas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j2gYgXGENM0C&amp;pg=PA173|series=Asia in focus|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-59884-160-2|page=173|chapter=Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Korean census figures systematically underestimate the number of followers of new religions, who are often reluctant to indicate their religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Don|date=September 2006|title=The Religious Revolution in Modern Korean History: From ethics to theology and from ritual hegemony to religious freedom|journal=The Review of Korean Studies|publisher=The Academy of Korean Studies|volume=9|issue=3|pages=249–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
Central to the faith is the belief in [[Haneullim]], the triad of Gods of Korean culture: the creator (Hanim/[[Hwanin]]), the teacher (Hanung/[[Hwanung]]) and the ruler (Dangun/Hanbaegŏm).&lt;ref name=religions/&gt;&lt;ref name=spirituality&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Donald L.|title=Korean spirituality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCBe9w9C2UkC&amp;pg=PA118|year=2008|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-3233-7|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dangun, the leader of the Korean nation, is thought to be the third, and human, manifestation of Haneullim ("God of Heaven") or Haneul ("Heaven").&lt;ref name="Lee Chi-ran, p. 12"/&gt; His physical mother was [[Ungnye]] (熊女) a bear transformed into a woman.&lt;ref name="Lee Chi-ran, p. 13"&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

After his earthly reign, Dangun ascended to Heaven.&lt;ref name="Lee Chi-ran, p. 13"/&gt; Semantically, Haneul connotes three Gods: God-Father as the creator of the universe, God-Teacher as the mentor of universal nature and God-King as ruler of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The faith is embodied in three sacred texts. Believers claim that they date back to the time of Dangun, or even earlier, and this claim, although disputed by scholars, is also accepted by many Koreans who do not belong to Daejongism.&lt;ref name="Baker (2007a), p. 465."&gt;Baker (2007a), p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt; The three texts are the ''Ch'ónbugong'' (The Classic of the Seal of Heaven), a narrative of the origins of the world, the ''Samil sin'go'' (The Teachings of the Triune God), a theological statement, and the ''Ch'amjóngyóng'' (The Classic of the Wise One), a manual of ethics.&lt;ref name="Baker (2007a), p. 465."&gt;Baker (2007a), p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of scholars believe that these books were compiled in the first two decades of the 20th century, based on visions and revelation the founder of Daejongism, Na Cheol (1863-1916), claimed to have received&lt;ref name="Lee Gyungwon, p. 39."&gt;Lee  Gyungwon, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daejongism is also well-known for its teaching of breathing techniques, known in the West as part of the so called internal alchemy ([[Neidan]] in [[Taoism]]). Daejongism's techniques focus on the '"sea of energy," which is also often referred to as the cinnabar field or the elixir field (''tanjón'').The ''tanjon'' is a field rich in the vital energy [[Qi]] and the religion offers techniques to draw on this field and circulate the energy through the human body. These techniques became extremely popular in the 1970s and generated a new interest in Daejongism and its school of internal alchemy, known as Kich'ónmun.&lt;ref name="Baker (2007b), p. 508."&gt;Baker (2007b), p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samsin Sinang==
Samsin Sinang is a Dangunist sect.&lt;ref name="Lee Chi-ran, p. 16"&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters are in [[Pyeongchang County]].&lt;ref name="Lee Chi-ran, p. 16"/&gt; The current leader is Bae Sun-moon, and the religion promotes the [[Korean reunification]].&lt;ref name="Lee Chi-ran, p. 16"/&gt;

==History and influences==
[[File:Na_cheol.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Na Cheol, the founder of the religion.]]
Na Cheol, known for his role as a leader of the [[Korean independence movement]] from Japanese rule, founded the religion in 1909 as its "great teacher" (''tosagyo'')&lt;ref name=sources/&gt; and named it first "Dangunism" (''Dangungyo'', [[Dangun]] religion) and then a year later "Daejongism" (''Daejonggyo'').&lt;ref name=religions/&gt;&lt;ref name=empires/&gt;{{rp|192}}

He said that it was a revival of ''Goshindo'' (古神道, "way of the Ancestral God"),&lt;ref name="Lee Chi-ran, p. 12"/&gt; the belief in the [[Haneullim|trinitarian god]] that was worshipped in ancient [[Korea]]. Some scholars have suggested the affinity to [[Christianity]], though the ethical basis of the religion is similar to [[Confucianism]].&lt;ref name=religions/&gt;

The importance of [[Dangun]] was influenced by [[Shin Chaeho]]'s ''A New Reading of History'', and Dangun was emphasised over another legendary figure, [[Jizi]] (Kija), who was said to not be Korean in origin.&lt;ref name=empires/&gt;{{rp|192}} Na claimed that the ''Goshindo'' religion was approximately 4300 years of age, which would make it Korea's oldest religion.

After the [[annexation of Korea]] in 1910 by the [[Empire of Japan]], the new religion was spread in [[Manchuria]] by Na, where it set up schools and social centers, and became a focus of the Korean independence movement.&lt;ref name=empires/&gt;{{rp|193}} Na committed suicide at a shrine on [[Kuwolsan|Mount Kuwŏl]] in 1916, saying that he had guilt over his failures and was martyring himself for the sake of his religion, God and people.&lt;ref name=sources&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ch'oe|first1=Yongho|last2=Lee|first2=Peter H.|last3=De Bary|first3=William Theodore|title=Sources of Korean Tradition: From the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9LoA9L1ABcC&amp;pg=PA331|series=Introduction to Asian civilizations: Sources of Korean Tradition|volume=2|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0-231-12031-1|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the religion after Na include his successor Kim Kyohong,&lt;ref name=empires/&gt;{{rp|50}} and An Ho-Sang.&lt;ref name=religions/&gt; The teachings of Dangun were said by Kim in his "History of the Divine Dangun's People" to be the ''sin gyo'' or "divine teaching", and he said that various Korean religions, such as that of [[Wang Kon]], were continuations of the ''sin gyo'', but that these beliefs had been suppressed under the [[Mongols]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]].&lt;ref name=empires/&gt;{{rp|194}}&lt;ref name=spirituality/&gt; The main task of the religion was ''chunggwang'' ("lighting anew"), meaning reviving the memory of Dangun.&lt;ref name=empires/&gt;{{rp|198}}

A particularly controversial issue concerns the roots in Daejongism of the global physical exercise and spirituality system known as [[Body &amp; Brain]], Dahnhak, or Dahn Yoga, founded by Korean master of martial arts and author [[Ilchi Lee]]. While "Body and Brain" does not normally emphasize its connection with Daejongism, scholars see it as one of many schools teaching a form of internal alchemy based on the techniques Daejongism popularized. According to American scholar of Korean religion Don Baker, "not only-did Dahn claim that its techniques were the same practices that Tàn'gun [Dangun] taught when he ruled over the first Korean kingdom; it also heralded the three Tàn'gun-era sacred texts of Taejonggyo [Daejongism] as authentic scripture." Only when the movement became international, references to Dangun and Daejongism were downplayed, although the [[c:File:Daejongism_symbol.svg|Daejongism symbol]] was embroidered on the original uniforms given to Dahnhak students in America and the organization "erected a large outdoor statue of Tan'gun near [its] Sedona [Arizona] headquarters."  Baker states that references to Daejongism, although not made explicit, remain easy to detect for those familiar with the Korean religion.&lt;ref name="Baker (2007b), p. 509."&gt;Baker (2007b), p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6599">The '''Dana Point Concours d'Elegance''' is an automotive charitable event held each year on the [[Monarch Beach, Dana Point, California|Monarch Beach]] Golf Links at the Monarch Beach Resort Resort in [[Dana Point, California]]. It is operated primarily as a Classic Car Club of America (CCCA) [[Concours d'Elegance|Concours]], with additional classes showcasing interesting and relevant automobiles and motorcycles. The 2010 event was held Sunday, June 27, 2010 moving from its traditional date in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release| title = Dana Point Concours d'Elegance Announces 2010 Event Date &amp; Name Change | publisher = Dana Point Concours d'Elegance| date = January 15, 2010| url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dana-point-concours-delegance-announces-2010-event-date--name-change-81727517.html| accessdate = February 5, 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Concours d'Elegance]]'' ([[French language|French]], literally "a competition of elegance") is an event open to both prewar and postwar collector cars in which they are judged for authenticity, function, history, and style. Classes are commonly arranged by type, marque (manufacturer), [[coachbuilder]], country of origin, or time period. Judges select first-, second-, and third-place finishers for each class in the event, and the judges confer the "Best of Show" award on one car from the group of first-place winners. In addition, a group of honorary judges, individuals who have made significant contributions to the automotive industry or motorsports, award a number of subjective awards to recognize standout vehicles regardless of class ribbons, as well as memorial awards created to honor specific automotive industry personages.

==History==
The first Concours was held in 1983 and was known as the Newport Beach Concours d'Elegance. It was held on the campus of [[University of California, Irvine]] for the first 10 years before moving to Pelican Hill Resort. In 2008 the event moved to the Monarch Beach Golf Links at the Monarch Beach Resort in Dana Point and in 2010 the Concours organizing committee officially changed the name of the event to the Dana Point Concours d'Elegance to properly reflect its new home.&lt;ref name="scm0910"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osborne|first=Donald|title=Dana Point Concours d'Elegance|journal=[[Sports Car Market]]|date=September 2010|volume=22|issue=9|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year's Dana Point Concours honors a featured marque, coachbuilder, type or classification:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9825">'''Dau al Set''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈdaw əl ˈsɛt}}), the first post-[[World War II]] artistic movement in [[Catalonia]], was founded in [[Barcelona]] in September 1948 by poet [[Joan Brossa]].  The movement, best known for translating the conscious and unconscious mind into art, was heavily influenced by both the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[Dada]]ist movements. In [[Catalan language|Catalan]] Dau al Set means "the seventh face of the dice", which expresses the movement's rupturist character.

== History ==
Dau al Set first began as an [[avant-garde]] artistic collective led by [[Joan Brossa]], a Catalan poet, in  September 1948. [[Joan Brossa]] established the group in response to the period’s conservative reigning government, which gained power after the [[Spanish Civil War]] known as the "[[:es:Guerra Civil Española|Guerra Civil]]". Under the new [[Fascism|fascist]] regime, [[Francisco Franco]]  radically changed many areas of the previous culture. One such example was the Spanish art community as seen in [[art and culture in Francoist Spain]]. During this time counterculture movements in Catalonia and Spain in general came to an abrupt halt.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/revista-dau-al-set-modest-cuixart-2016|title=Revista Dau al Set. Modest Cuixart|website=www.macba.cat|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such artistic groups were replaced with [[Art and culture in Francoist Spain|Nationalist Fascist Art]], which often functioned as a means for government endorsement and propaganda. In an attempt to revive the avant-garde scene in Spain Dau al Set was formed.

In 1949, with help from [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]]'s private printing press, Dau al Set published its first self-entitled magazine journal. The majority of the publication was written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a language prohibited under the [[Francoist Spain|Franco Regime]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cirlot|first=Lourdes|date=December 2008|title=El grupo Dau al Set|url=http://www.triarte.es/catalogos/Cat%20Dau%20al%20Set.pdf|journal=El Mundo de Dau al Set|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dau al Set typically ran a print between one hundred and two hundred copies,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; consisting of four to twelve pages.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franco Lahoz|first=Amado|date=December 2008|title=Sumario de la revista Dau al Set|url=http://www.triarte.es/catalogos/Cat%20Dau%20al%20Set.pdf|journal=El Mundo de Dau al Set|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine journal was delivered throughout Barcelona to those with subscriptions and served a niche population at the time. The format of the magazine was 22.5&amp;nbsp;cm x 18.7&amp;nbsp;cm in the [[broadsheet]] style and never bound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These publications continued on a regular basis until the end of 1951 at which point Dau al Set began to dissolve.

In 1952, Dau al Set founding member [[Antoni Tàpies]] left the group to promote his own independent work in the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[Informalism|Informal]] art styles. The following year [[Joan Ponç]] left to Brazil to continue to paint and spread his unique style. And one year later [[Modest Cuixart|Modest Cuixcart]] left the group as well. During this time from 1953 till 1956 Dau al Set continued to be created and published by Joan-Josep Tharrats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the final years the magazine decreased from an issue a month to an issue every season to then two issues a year. The final issue was created and distributed in 1956.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Style ==
Initially, Dau al Set began as an offshoot of [[Surrealism]], but slowly grew into a distinct style with many existing components. One such component began with the incorporation of the surrealist world of dreams, where in Dau al Set expands upon by combing scientific and philosophical articles with magical undertones derived from [[Joan Brossa|Joan Brossa's]] personalized style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lletra.uoc.edu/ca/revista/dau-al-set-1948-1956/detall|title=Dau al Set (1948-1956) - lletrA - Literatura catalana a internet|last=Catalunya|first=Universitat Oberta de|website=lletra.uoc.edu|language=ca|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of magical elements pervaded throughout the entire movement to showcase an esoteric world of inner exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elcultural.com/revista/arte/Dau-al-set/14686|title=Dau al set|website=www.elcultural.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While magic was seen consistently the different members each contributed a unique style to Dau al Set. One of the most drastic was the contributions from [[Joan Ponç]]. Ponç's art frequently contained demonic images actualized with a series of different monsters throughout the work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast, [[Modest Cuixart|Modest Cuixart's]] work often contained images of fantasy influenced by [[German Expressionism|German expressionism]] and [[Joan Miró]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, [[Antoni Tàpies|Antoni Tápies]] often emulated the style of [[Paul Klee]] with obscure images surrounded by a dark atmosphere and phosphorescent lighting. With the base of magical elements these three unique techniques joined together to create the style seen in the Dau al Set movement.

== Influences ==
Dau al Set  was heavily influenced by two movements before its creation, those two being [[Dada]]ism and [[Surrealism]].  Dadaism was a European art movement in the early 20th century which focused on the avant-garde. This style was meant to fight against the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] in society with the belief that their reason and logic were the cause of war. With an anti-reason and anti-logic sentiment most of the works of art often contained elements of chaos and irrationality. Dadaist art also utilized the following techniques of [[cubism]], [[collage]]s, [[cut-up technique]], [[photomontage]]s, and [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] which can be seen in Dau al Set's work. From this movement spawned the pre-war avant-garde which was the community Dau al Set were trying to revive. Some influential artists on Dau al Set from this movement are [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Max Ernst]].

Another influence on Dau al Set was [[Surrealism]], a cultural movement greatly influenced by Dadaism, which began in the 1920s. This style was often considered a portrayal of the dream world; a reality which existed right below everyday life. It also had a large political focus which was often used to contradict a given community's social norms often imposed by the bourgeois. Some artists from this movement that influenced Dau al Set were [[Joan Miró]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Josep Vicenç Foix]], and [[Salvador Dalí]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other methods that were influenced was the idea of magical aspects that were often seen in the dream world surrealism created. However, in Dau al Set these magical aspects were developed and expounded upon.

== Members ==
There were six founding members of Dau al Set including a poet [[Joan Brossa]], a philosopher [[Arnau Puig]], three artists [[Joan Ponç]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], and [[Modest Cuixart]], as well as a dual painter and editor [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]].

Over the years Dau al Set ran there were occasional contributors, such as [[Juan Eduardo Cirlot]], [[Antonio Saura]], [[Enrique Tábara]], and [[Manolo Millares]]. Their contributions came often in the form of writings which helped to continued to establish Dau al Set as an intellectual piece of work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Impact ==
Dau al Set has had a lasting impact throughout history the most notable being the continuation of the avant-garde in Spain throughout a repressive regime. Moreover, Dau al Set contributed to the creation of the [[Informalism|Informalist]] movement seen in Spain during the fifties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arteespana.com/grupodaualset.htm|title=Grupo Dau al Set|website=www.arteespana.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the magical and fantasy elements of Dau al Set was seen to later emerge again in Spain in the eighties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This group also stood as a large influence for other artistic movements in Spain such as the [[Grup d'Elx|Grup d’Elx]] and El Paso, with important artists such as [[Joan Castejón]], [[Eusebio Sempere]] or [[Manolo Millares]]. Additionally, each of the members made their own impacts after the movement was dissolved. Most notably is [[Antoni Tàpies]] who continued with his style based heavily in surrealism and later became a notable artist for his work in Abstract art.

====Bechuanaland Protectorate====
The seven censuses of Botswana before its independence happened irregularly. Due to the [[Second Boer War|Anglo-Boer War]], the first census of [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]], originally set to occur in 1901, took place on 17 April 1904.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.cso.gov.bw/index.php?option=com_content1&amp;site=census&amp;id=28&amp;parent_id=27|publisher=Central Statistics Office|accessdate=20 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69I1Cikab?url=http://www.cso.gov.bw/index.php?option=com_content1&amp;site=census&amp;id=28&amp;parent_id=27|archivedate=20 July 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1931 census was postponed to 1936 because of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt; The early censuses were unreliable and took several years to tabulate; the results were outdated by the time they were calculated.

====Post-independence====
There have been five censuses after the independence of Botswana, each occurring every ten years in the year ending in 1 (i.e. 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011). The 1971 census was the first census in Botswana to use de facto enumeration; this method counts people based on how many people spent census night at a specific location. Previously, the citizens were counted based on their usual place of residence. The 2001 census was the first census in Botswana to comply with the [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] 2000 Census Project, the guidelines of which unify the demographic statistics in southern [[Africa]]. The most recent census was the [[2011 Botswana Population and Housing Census]], which occurred in August 2011.

===UN estimates===
According to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Botswana}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to only  413,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 32.6%, 63.4% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 4% was 65 years or older.&lt;ref name="WPP 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm|title=Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision|author=|date=|website=un.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Internal Affairs''' ('''DIA'''; [[Māori language|Māori]]: ''Te Tari Taiwhenua'') is the public service department of New Zealand charged with issuing [[New Zealand passport|passports]]; administering applications for [[New Zealand nationality law|citizenship]] and [[New Zealand Lottery Grants Board|lottery]] grants; enforcing [[Censorship in New Zealand|censorship]] and [[Gambling in New Zealand|gambling]] laws; registering [[births]], [[deaths]], [[marriages]] and [[Civil union in New Zealand|civil unions]]; supplying support services to [[Ministers of the Crown]]; and advising the [[Government of New Zealand|government]] on a range of relevant policies and issues, part of a number of functions performed by Internal Affairs.

Other services provided by the Department include a translation service, publication of the [[New Zealand Gazette]] (the official newspaper of the New Zealand Government), a flag hire service, management of VIP visits to New Zealand, running the [[Lake Taupo]] harbourmaster's office (under a special agreement with the local [[iwi]]) and the administration of offshore islands.

During the late 1990s both the [[National Library of New Zealand]] and [[Archives New Zealand]] were separated from the Department along with the [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]].  On 25 March 2010, the former Minister of State Services [[Tony Ryall]] announced that the Library and Archives would be merged into the Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/state-sector-changes-improve-performance|title=beehive.govt.nz - State sector changes to improve performance|publisher=Beehive.govt.nz|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Library and Archives stakeholders expressed serious concerns about the changes proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aranz.org.nz/includes/download.aspx?ID=107780|title=Underpinning democracy: the future of Archives New Zealand   : Press release|publisher=Aranz.org.nz|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1 February 2011, both were brought into the Department of Internal Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/minister-welcomes-state-sector-legislation|title=Minister welcomes State Sector legislation (press release)|author=Guy, Nathan|work=beehive.govt.nz|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Department of Internal Affairs traces its roots back to the [[Colonial Secretary (New Zealand)|Colonial Secretary's Office]], which from the time New Zealand became a British [[colony]], in 1840, was responsible for almost all central Government duties. The Department was the first government department to be established in New Zealand, and it became the home for a diverse range of government functions providing services to New Zealanders and advice to Ministers of the Crown. Hence the title of [[Michael Bassett]]'s 1997 history of the department: ''The Mother of All Departments''.

Many of these responsibilities were lost as new departments and ministries were formed. The office's name was changed to the Department of Internal Affairs from 19 November  1907.  Change has continued to the present day, as new roles and functions have come into the Department and others have been transferred elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Department|url=http://www.dia.govt.nz/About-Internal-Affairs---Department-structure---History-of-the-Department|publisher=The Department of Internal Affairs|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related organisations==
The Department of Internal Affairs includes the [[New Zealand Office of Ethnic Affairs|Office of Ethnic Affairs]], which provides information to ethnic communities and policy advice to the government and the [[New Zealand Local Government Commission|Local Government Commission]], which makes decisions on the structure and representation requirements of [[local government]]. The Department's present activities also include the implementation of recent dog control and local government legislation.

The Department has responsibility for supporting the community and voluntary sector through the Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector.

The Chief Executive of the Department of Internal Affairs is also the Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO), with responsibility for developing and overseeing the government's ICT (Information, Communications and Technology) strategy and providing strategic advice on related matters. The Department also includes the National Library of New Zealand, Te Puna Māturanga o Aotearoa and Archives New Zealand, Te Rua Mahara o te Kāwanatanga. These two organisations were integrated into the Department on 1 February 2011

The Department provides secretariat support for several entities including:

* The Gambling Commission
* The Local Government Commission
* Commissions of Inquiry and ad hoc bodies such as the Royal Commission on the Pike River Coal Mine tragedy and the Canterbury Earthquakes Royal Commission.
* The Library and Information Advisory Commission, Ngā Kaiwhakamārama i ngā Kohikohinga Kōrero
* The Public Lending Right Advisory Group
* The Guardians Kaitiaki of the Alexander Turnbull Library
* The Archives Council
* The [[Film and Literature Board of Review]]
* The Confidential Listening and Assistance Service

== Ministers ==
The Department serves 6 portfolios, 7 ministers and a parliamentary under-secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beehive.govt.nz/sites/all/files/New-Ministerial-List.pdf|format=PDF|title=Ministerial List for Announcement on 6 October 2014|publisher=Beehive.govt.nz|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Invitation to Present Commercial Opportunities==
An ''invitation to present commercial opportunities'' (IPCO) is a process designed by the department to invite the [[private sector]] to present ideas for commercial relationships with government in relation to services already built/created by the government agency. The commercial relationships can include a [[public-private partnership]] or other arrangement between the private sector and the government to further develop, fund, innovate, distribute, and ensure uptake and use of the services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.govt.nz/press.nsf/d77da9b523f12931cc256ac5000d19b6/f77598fd51b36124cc25761f00048f3e!OpenDocument|title=Government explores private sector interest in online igovt services|date=27 August 2009|publisher=Department of Internal Affairs|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An IPCO is issued where a government is seeking options that provide it access to private sector specialised expertise, innovative ideas, and funding and the sharing of risk.  Extending the reach of the services, while building on the benefits of established branding and related [[market penetration]] are also important.

An IPCO is not a [[procurement]] process for goods or services, and it does not signal whether any final decision has been made on any future procurement process or any other action will be taken by government.  It is intended to enable government to gauge whether there are organisations interested in, and what options are available for, public-private partnerships or other commercial arrangements to use and/or further develop, fund, innovate, distribute, and ensure uptake and use of a [[government agency]]’s services by the public, government agencies and the private sector.

The IPCO process was developed in August 2009 to assist with collecting information from the private sector to use in advising government on future development and funding options for particular services. The IPCO has been used for two electronic identity services the New Zealand Government has built for government use to provide identity dependent services online. The two services are called the igovt logon service and the igovt identity verification service (igovt services). Government directed the Department of Internal Affairs to invite the market to provide written responses about whether private sector organisations were interested in:
* using the igovt services if available to them, and
* entering into public-private partnerships or other arrangements for the further development, funding, innovation, distribution, and ensuring uptake and use of the igovt services.

{{Astrology}}
It is unclear whether a form of '''Early Irish astrology''' existed prior to contact with [[Western astrology]], as the earliest Irish language sources are simply translations from standard Western sources. Historian [[Peter Berresford Ellis]] argues that although there is evidence of the development of Irish astrology from the 7th Century AD onwards, anything earlier is left to conjecture based on continental Celtic artifacts like the [[Coligny calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=Peter Berresford |title=Early Irish Astrology: An Historical Argument |journal=Réalta |date=1996 |volume=3 |issue=3 |url=http://cura.free.fr/xv/11ellis1.html |accessdate=13 August 2018 |quote=In all histories of western astrology there is a curious omission. There are no references to early Irish, nor - indeed - ancient Celtic, astrological practices.... We can trace the development of Irish astrology fairly easily from the 7th Century AD, when our records in Irish and Hiberno-Latin begin to survive. But for anything prior to this period we must, at this time, turn to Continental Celtic remains.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the pre-Celtic megaliths in Ireland are often aligned with solar and lunar phenomena, no evidence has been found for the type of planetary symbol system as seen in other cultures' systems of [[astrology]].

The [[feminist movement]] has effected change in Western society, including [[women's suffrage]]; greater access to education; more equitable pay with men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to [[contraceptive]]s and [[abortion]]); and the right to own property.&lt;ref name="Butler2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Feminism by any other name (Judith Butler interviews Rosi Braidotti) | journal = [[Differences (journal)|differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies]] | volume = 6 | issue = 2&amp;ndash;3 | pages = 272&amp;ndash;361 | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] | date = Summer 1994 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Messer-Davidow"&gt;{{cite book | last = Messer-Davidow | first = Ellen | title = Disciplining feminism: from social activism to academic discourse | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham, [[North Carolina]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780822328438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard Psychology Professor Steven Pinker argues that feminism has reduced domestic violence, especially against men as their likelihood of being killed by a female intimate partner has decreased six-fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Pynchon | first = Victoria | title = Women's economic power decreases domestic violence against both genders | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/shenegotiates/2011/12/05/womens-economic-power-decreases-domestic-violence-against-both-genders/ | work = [[Forbes]] | publisher = Forbes, Inc. | date = December 5, 2011 | access-date = February 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's rights ==

From the 1960s on, the [[women's liberation movement]] campaigned for [[women's rights]], including the same pay as men, equal rights in law, and the freedom to plan their families. Their efforts were met with mixed results.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Freeman | first = Jo | author-link = Jo Freeman | contribution = From suffrage to women's liberation: feminism in twentieth century America | editor-last = Freeman | editor-first = Jo | editor-link = Jo Freeman | title = Women: a feminist perspective| pages = 509–528 | publisher = Mayfield Pub.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], a public groundswell of opinion in favour of legal equality gained pace,{{When|date=September 2009}} including during the [[Women's rights#Modern movements|modern movement]], partly through the extensive employment of women in men's traditional roles during both world wars. By the 1960s, the legislative process was being readied, tracing through MP [[Willie Hamilton]]'s [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] report, his Equal Pay for Equal Work Bill, the creation of a Sex Discrimination Board, Lady Sear's draft sex anti-discrimination bill, and a government [[Green Paper]] of 1973, until 1975 when the first British Sex Discrimination Act, an [[Equal Pay Act 1970|Equal Pay Act]], and an [[Equal Opportunities Commission (United Kingdom)|Equal Opportunities Commission]] came into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mackie | first = Lindsay | title = The equal pay day is here: Lindsay Mackie looks at the new laws aimed at boosting women's status | url = http://search.proquest.com/hnpguardianobserver/docview/185773278/3FED2E4525A34ECEPQ/7 | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | page = 5 | subscription = yes | date = 29 December 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Sex discrimination in advertising banned | work = [[The Times]] | publisher = [[News UK]] | date = 29 December 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With encouragement from the UK government, the other countries of the [[EEC]] soon followed suit with an agreement to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the European Community.

In the [[United States|U.S.]], the [[National Organization for Women]] ([[National Organization for Women|NOW]]) was created in 1966 with the purpose of bringing about equality for all women. NOW was one important group that fought for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] ([[Equal Rights Amendment|ERA]]). This amendment stated that "equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose | url = http://now.org/about/history/statement-of-purpose/ | publisher = [[National Organization for Women]] }} [http://now.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Statement-of-Purpose.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; But there was disagreement on how the proposed amendment would be understood. Supporters believed it would guarantee women equal treatment. But critics feared it might deny women the right be financially supported by their husbands. It died in 1982 because not enough states had ratified it. ERAs have been introduced in subsequent Congresses, but have failed to be passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=National Organization for Women: Definition |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/national-organization-for-women?cat=biz-fin&amp;nr=1 | website = answers.com | publisher = [[Answers.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, various laws advancing women's rights were promulgated, although many issues remained to be resolved.

In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through [[birth control]], which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family. The movement had been started in the 1910s by U.S. pioneering social reformer [[Margaret Sanger]] and in the UK and internationally by [[Marie Stopes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Margaret Sanger |url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1676.html | website = u-s-history.com | publisher = US History.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication of data and advocacy relevant to rights increased in recent decades. For example, the ''United Nations Human Development Report 2004'' estimated that, when both paid employment and unpaid household tasks are accounted for, on average women work more than men. In rural areas of selected developing countries women performed an average of 20 percent more work than men, or an additional 102 minutes per day. In the [[OECD]] countries surveyed, on average women performed 5 percent more work than men, or 20 minutes per day when both paid employment and unpaid household tasks are taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = Section 28: Gender, Work Burden, and Time Allocation |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr04_complete.pdf |title= United Nations Human Development Report 2004 | page = 233 | format = PDF | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women, it came into force on 3 September 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women New York, 18 December 1979 | url = http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CEDAW.aspx |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=September 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries have ratified the Convention subject to certain declarations, reservations, and objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Declarations, Reservations and Objections to CEDAW|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/reservations-country.htm |publisher=United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women|accessdate=September 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]], [[Sudan]], [[Somalia]], [[Qatar]], [[Nauru]], [[Palau]], [[Tonga]], and the United States have not ratified CEDAW.&lt;ref name="Simpson"&gt;{{Cite news |author=Simpson, Peggy |date=March 30, 2009 |title=Chances Improve for Ratification of CEDAW |url=http://www.womensmediacenter.com/ex/033009.html |publisher=Women's Media Center |accessdate=September 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406105638/http://www.womensmediacenter.com/ex/033009.html |archivedate=April 6, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Expecting a [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|U.S. Senate]] vote,&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt; NOW has encouraged [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] to remove U.S. reservations and objections added in 2002&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt; before the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Women need a strong CEDAW, not one with disabling RDUs|url=http://capwiz.com/now/issues/alert/?alertid=13970771 |publisher=National Organization for Women (capwiz.com)|accessdate=September 6, 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131010145456/http://www.now.org/lists/now-action-list/msg00395.html | archive-date = October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Don't Be Deceived: Only a 'Clean' CEDAW Should Be Ratified |url=http://www.nowfoundation.org/issues/global/083109cedaw.html |date=August 31, 2009 |publisher=National Organization for Women Foundation |accessdate=September 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910064523/http://www.nowfoundation.org/issues/global/083109cedaw.html |archivedate=September 10, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CEDAW does not protect men from any form of discrimination.

== Reproductive rights ==
In the U.S., a major focus of political activism has centered on [[reproductive rights]], including for (and, among opponents, against) the decision by the U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in the case of [[Roe v. Wade|''Roe'' v. ''Wade'']] enunciating a [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] right for a woman to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term.

== Gender-neutral language ==
[[Gender neutrality in English|Gender-neutral English]] is a description of [[Word usage|language usages]] which do not recognize gender and are aimed at minimizing assumptions regarding the biological [[sex]] of human [[reference|referents]]. The advocacy of gender-neutral language reflects, at least, two different agendas: one to clarify the ''inclusion'' of both sexes or genders (gender-inclusive language); the other that gender, as a category, is rarely worth marking in language (gender-neutral language). Gender-neutral language is sometimes described as ''non-sexist language'' by advocates and ''politically correct language'' by opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usask.ca/policies/2_03.htm |title= University of Saskatchewan Policies 2001: Gender Neutral Language |accessdate=March 25, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061028110505/http://www.usask.ca/policies/2_03.htm  |archivedate = October 28, 2006 | publisher = [[University of Saskatchewan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heterosexual family relationships ==
The increased entry of women into the workplace beginning in the twentieth century has affected gender roles and the [[division of labor]] within [[household]]s. Sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] in ''The Second Shift'' and ''The Time Bind'' presented evidence that, in two-career couples, men and women, on average, spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework.&lt;ref name="Hochschild1"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Russell Hochschild | first1 = Arlie | last2 = Machung | first2 = Anne | author-link1 = Arlie Russell Hochschild | title = [[The Second Shift|The second shift: working families and the revolution at home]] | publisher = Penguin Books | location = New York | year = 2003 }} {{ISBN|9780142002926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochschild2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell Hochschild | first = Arlie | author-link = Arlie Russell Hochschild | title = [[Time bind|The time bind: when work becomes home and home becomes work]] | publisher = Henry Holt &amp; Co. | location = New York | year = 2001 }} {{ISBN|9780805066432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist writer [[Cathy Young]] responds to Hochschild's assertions by arguing that, in some cases, women may prevent the equal participation of men in housework and parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Young | first = Cathy | authorlink = Cathy Young | title = The Mama Lion at the Gate | url = http://www.salon.com/2000/06/12/gatekeeping/ | date = June 12, 2000 | accessdate = July 8, 2008 | website = Salon.com | publisher = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist criticisms of men's contributions to child care and domestic labor in the Western middle class are typically centered on the idea that it is unfair for women to be expected to perform more than half of a household's domestic work and child care when both members of the relationship also work outside the home. Several studies provide statistical evidence that the financial income of married men does not affect their rate of attending to household duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = South | first1 = Scott J. | last2 = Spitze | first2 = Gelnna | title = Housework in marital and nonmarital households | journal = [[American Sociological Review]] | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 327&amp;ndash;348 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | jstor = 2095937 | doi = 10.2307/2095937 | date = June 1994 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2095937 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Fenstermaker Berk | first1 =Sarah | last2 = Shih | first2 = Anthony |contribution=Contributions to household labour: comparing wives' and husbands' reports |series=SAGE Yearbooks on Women and Politics Series  |title=Women and household labour  |year=1980 |editor-last=Fenstermaker Berk | editor-first =Sarah |publisher=[[Sage Publications|Sage]]  |location=Beverly Hills, California | isbn = 9780803912113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Dubious Conceptions'', [[Kristin Luker]] discusses the effect of feminism on teenage women's choices to bear children, both in and out of wedlock. She says that, as childbearing out of wedlock has become more socially acceptable, young women, especially poor young women, while not bearing children at a higher rate than in the 1950s, now see less of a reason to get married before having children. Her explanation for this is that the economic prospects for poor men are slim, hence poor women have a low chance of finding a husband who will be able to provide reliable financial support.&lt;ref name="Luker"&gt;{{cite book | last = Luker | first = Kristin | author-link = Kristin Luker | title = Dubious conceptions: the politics of teenage pregnancy | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780674217034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although research suggests that, to an extent, both women and men perceive feminism to be in conflict with romance, studies of undergraduates and older adults have shown that feminism has positive impacts on relationship health for women and sexual satisfaction for men, and found no support for negative stereotypes of feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rudman | first1 = Laurie A. | last2 = Phelan | first2 = Julie E. | author-link1 = Laurie A.

[[Christian feminism]] is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand [[Christianity]] in light of the equality of women and men. Because this equality has been historically ignored, Christian feminists believe their contributions are necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of biologically determined characteristics such as sex. Their major issues are the [[ordination of women]], male dominance in Christian marriage, and claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of abilities of women compared to men. They also are concerned with the balance of parenting between mothers and fathers and the overall treatment of women in the church.&lt;ref name="Haddad"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Haddad | first = Mimi | title = Egalitarian pioneers: Betty Friedan or Catherine Booth? | journal = Priscilla Papers | volume = 20 | issue = 4  | pages = 53&amp;ndash;59 | publisher = [[Christians for Biblical Equality]] | date = Autumn 2006 | url = http://www2.cbeinternational.org/CBE_InfoPack/pdf_files/haddad_egalitarian_pioneers.pdf | format = pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Anderson | first1 = Pamela Sue | last2 = Clack | first2 = Beverley | author-link = Pamela Sue Anderson | title = Feminist philosophy of religion: critical readings | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780415257503 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New feminism]] is a branch of difference feminism situated within Catholicism.

[[Islamic feminism]] is concerned with the role of [[Women and Islam|women in Islam]] and aims for the full equality of all [[Muslims]], regardless of gender, in public and private life. Islamic feminists advocate [[women's rights]], [[gender equality]], and social justice grounded in an Islamic framework. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm |publisher=feminismeislamic.org |author=Catalan Islamic Board |title=II International Congress on Islamic Feminism|accessdate=9 July 2008 |date=24–27 October 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080321140633/http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm  |archivedate = 21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the movement seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the [[Quran]] and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings of [[Muhammad]]), and ''[[sharia]]'' (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Badran | first = Margot | url = http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm | title = Al-Ahram Weekly: Islamic Feminism: What's in a Name? | accessdate = 9 July 2008 | date = 17–23 January 2002 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150320074746/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm | archivedate = 20 March 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within [[Judaism]] and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. Feminist movements, with varying approaches and successes, have opened up within all major branches of Judaism. In its modern form, the movement can be traced to the early 1970s in the United States. According to [[Judith Plaskow]], who has focused on feminism in [[Reform Judaism]], the main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or ''[[minyan]]'', the exemption from positive time-bound ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'', and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate [[Jewish view of marriage#Divorce|divorce]].&lt;ref name="Plaskow1997"&gt;{{citation |last=Plaskow | first =Judith | author-link = Judith Plaskow |contribution=Jewish feminist thought |editor-last1=Frank | editor-first1 = Daniel H. |editor-last2 = Leaman | editor-first2 = Oliver | editor-link2 = Oliver Leaman |title=History of Jewish philosophy |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780415324694 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dianic Wicca]] or Wiccan feminism is a female-focused and [[Goddess movement|Goddess]]-centered Wiccan faith that is also known as a feminist religion that teaches witchcraft as every woman's right. It is also one faith of the many practiced in [[Wicca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Raphael | first = Melissa | contribution = Chapter ^: Feminist Witchcraft | editor-last=Raphael | editor-first = Melissa |title=Introducing Thealogy: discourse on the Goddess |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781850759751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===
[[Feminist theology]], sometimes referred to as the [[Goddess movement]], is a movement found in several religions to reconsider the traditions, practices, [[scripture]]s, and [[theology|theologies]] of those religions from a feminist perspective.&lt;ref name=Parsons_S /&gt;&lt;ref name=Loades_A /&gt;&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the [[clergy]] and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about [[God|the deity or deities]], determining women's place in relation to [[career]] and [[motherhood]], and studying images of women in the religion's [[sacred texts]].&lt;ref name=Parsons_S /&gt;&lt;ref name=Loades_A /&gt; In [[Wicca]], "the Goddess" is a deity of prime importance, along with her consort the [[Horned God]]. In the earliest Wiccan publications, she is described as a tribal goddess of the witch community, neither omnipotent nor universal, and it was recognised that there was a greater "[[Cosmological argument|Prime Mover]]", although the witches did not concern themselves much with this being.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Gerald B. | last = Gardner | authorlink = Gerald Gardner (Wiccan) | contribution = Witches' memories and beliefs | editor-first = Gerald B. | editor-last = Gardner | editor-link = Gerald Gardner (Wiccan) | title = The meaning of witchcraft |pages=26&amp;ndash;27 | publisher = Copple House Books | location = Lakemont, Georgia | year = 1988 | origyear = 1959 | isbn = 9780939708024 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friulian''' ({{IPAc-en|f|r|i|ˈ|uː|l|i|ən}}) or '''Friulan''' (''{{Audio|Furlan.ogg|furlan}}'' or, affectionately, ''{{lang|fur|marilenghe}}'' in Friulian, ''{{lang|it|friulano}}'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], ''{{lang|de|Furlanisch}}'' in [[German language|German]], ''{{lang|sl|furlanščina}}'' in [[Slovene language|Slovene]]) is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] belonging to the [[Rhaeto-Romance languages|Rhaeto-Romance]] family, spoken in the [[Friuli]] region of northeastern [[Italy]]. Friulian has around 600,000 speakers, the vast majority of whom also speak [[Italian language|Italian]]. It is sometimes called '''Eastern Ladin''' since it shares the same roots as [[Ladin language|Ladin]], but, over the centuries, it has diverged under the influence of surrounding languages, including [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Venetian language|Venetian]], and [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. Documents in Friulian are attested from the 11th century and poetry and literature date as far back as 1300.  By the 20th century, there was a revival of interest in the language that has continued to this day.
In North America the more common English form is Friulan for both the language and the ethnic identity of the people living in Friuli and abroad. Friulan follows the example of Friulano in Italian. See the reference, ''Friulan Dictionary: English–Friulan / Friulan–English.''  Eds. Gianni Nazzi &amp; Deborah Saidero. Udine: Ent Friul tal Mond. 2000.

== History ==
[[File:Bandiere dal Friûl.svg|thumb|Historical flag of Friûl and the Friulian folk.]]
A question which causes many debates is the influence of the Latin spoken in [[Aquileia]] and surrounding areas. Some claim that it had peculiar features that later passed into Friulian. Epigraphs and inscriptions from that period show some variants if compared to the standard Latin language, but most of them are common to other areas of the Roman Empire; often, it is cited that [[Fortunatianus of Aquileia|Fortunatianus]], the bishop of [[Aquileia]] {{circa}} 342 - 357 AD, wrote a commentary to the [[Gospel]] in ''sermo rusticus'' (the  common/{{wiktang|rustic}} language), which, therefore, would have been quite divergent from the standard [[Latin language|Latin]] of administration.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionefvg.com/storiafriuli/05aquilcristiana/testoaqcristiana.htm|title=regionefvg.com - This website is for sale! - promozione commercio imprenditoria gastronomia turismo arte cultura musica archeologia antichità Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.regionefvg.com|accessdate=17 March 2018 |deadurl=usurped}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The text itself did not survive so its language cannot be examined, but its attested existence testifies to a shift of languages while, for example, other important communities of Northern Italy were still speaking Latin. The language spoken before the arrival of the Romans in 181&amp;nbsp;BC was of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] origin since the inhabitants belonged to the [[Carni]], a Celtic population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=uUlRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139|title=The Oxford Guide to the Romance Languages|last=Ledgeway|first=Adam|last2=Maiden|first2=Martin|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199677108|location=|pages=139|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Friulian, the words of Celtic origins are many (terms referring to mountains, woods, plants, animals, ''[[inter alia]]'') and much influence of the original population is shown in toponyms (names of villages with ''-acco'', ''-icco'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=Qmg6DfzFP9cC&amp;pg=PA31|title=Our Italian Surnames|last=Fucilla|first=Joseph Guerin|date=1949|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|year=|isbn=9780806311876|location=|pages=31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even influences from the [[Lombardic language]] - Friuli was one of [[Kingdom of the Lombards|their]] strongholds - are very frequent. In a similar manner, there are unique connections to the modern, nearby [[Lombard language]].

In Friulian, there are also a plethora of words of [[German language|German]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]] origin. From that evidence, scholars today agree that the formation of Friulian dates back to circa 1000 AD, at the same time as other dialects derived from Latin (see [[Vulgar Latin]]). The first written records of Friulian have been found in administrative acts of the 13th century, but the documents became more frequent in the following century, when literary works also emerged (''Frammenti letterari'' for example). The main centre at that time was [[Cividale del Friuli|Cividale]]. The Friulian language has never acquired official status: legal statutes were first written in Latin, then in Venetian and finally in Italian.

=== The "Ladin Question" ===
[[File:Ascoli.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Historical linguist [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] presented the theory that Ladin, Romansh and Friulian are from the same family.]]
The idea of unity among [[Ladin language|Ladin]], [[Romansh language|Romansh]] and Friulian comes from the Italian [[historical linguistics|historical linguist]] [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]], who was born in [[Gorizia]]. In 1871, he presented his theory that these three languages are part of one family, which in the past stretched from [[Switzerland]] to [[Muggia]] and perhaps also [[Istria]]. The three languages are the only survivors of this family and all developed differently. Friulian was much less influenced by [[German language|German]]. The scholar Francescato claimed subsequently that until the 14th century, the [[Venetian language]] shared many phonetic features with Friulian and Ladin and so he thought that Friulian was a much more [[conservative (language)|conservative]] language. Many features that Ascoli thought were peculiar to the Rhaeto-Romance languages can, in fact, be found in other languages of Northern [[Italy]].

== Areas ==

=== Italy ===
[[File:Friulan language.PNG|thumb|Spread of the Friulian language in Italy]]
Today, Friulian is spoken in the province of [[Province of Udine|Udine]], including the area of the Carnia [[Alps]], but as well throughout the province of [[Pordenone]], in half of the province of [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]], and in the eastern part of the province of [[Province of Venice|Venice]]. In the past, the language borders were wider since in [[Trieste]] and [[Muggia]], local variants of Friulian were spoken. The main document about the dialect of Trieste, or ''tergestino'', is "Dialoghi piacevoli in dialetto vernacolo triestino", published by G. Mainati in 1828.

=== World ===
Friuli was, until the 1960s, an area of deep poverty, causing a large number of Friulian speakers to emigrate. Most went to [[France]], [[Belgium]], and [[Switzerland]] or outside [[Europe]], to [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Australia]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], the [[United States]], and [[South Africa]]. In those countries, there are associations of Friulian immigrants (called ''Fogolâr furlan'') that try to protect their traditions and language.

== Literature ==
{{missing|section|Examples and english translation of 13th and 14th century texts|date=May 2018}}
The first texts in Friulian date back to the 13th century and are mainly commercial or juridical acts. The examples show that Friulian was used together with Latin, which was still the administrative language. The main examples of literature that have survived (much from this period has been [[Lost works|lost]]) are poems from the 14th century and are usually dedicated to the theme of love and are probably inspired by the Italian poetic movement [[Dolce Stil Novo]]. The most notable work is ''Piruç myò doç inculurit'' (which means "My sweet, coloured pear"); it was composed by an anonymous author from Cividale del Friuli, probably in 1380.

There are few differences in the first two rows, which demonstrates that there has not been a great evolution in the language except for several words which are no longer used (for example, ''dum(n) lo'', a word which means "child", which was used to be more frequently). A modern Friulian speaker can understand these texts with only a little difficulty.

The second important period for Friulian literature is the 16th century. The main author of this period was [[Ermes di Colorêt]], who composed over 200 poems.

Notes:
* {{IPA|/m, p, b/}} are [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]], whereas {{IPA|/f, v/}} are [[labiodental consonant|labiodental]] and {{IPA|/w/}} is [[velarized|labiovelar]].
* Note that, in the standard language, a phonemic distinction exists between true palatal stops {{IPA|[c ɟ]}} and palatoalveolar affricates {{IPA|[tʃ dʒ]}}. The former (written {{angbr|cj gj}}) originate from Latin {{angbr|c g}} before {{angbr|a}}, whereas the latter (written {{angbr|c/ç z}}, where {{angbr|c}} is found before {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|i}}, and {{angbr|ç}} is found elsewhere) originate primarily from Latin {{angbr|c g}} before {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|i}}. The palatalization of Latin {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|g}} before {{angbr|a}} is characteristic of the [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]] and is also found in [[French language|French]] and some [[Occitan language|Occitan]] varieties. In some Friulian dialects (e.g. Western dialects), corresponding to Central {{IPA|[c ɟ tʃ dʒ]}} are found {{IPA|[tʃ dʒ s z]}}. Note in addition that, due to various sound changes, these sounds are all now phonemic; note, for example, the minimal pair ''{{lang|fur|cjoc}}'' "drunk" vs. ''{{lang|fur|çoc}}'' "log".

===Orthography===
Some notes on orthography (from the perspective of the standard, i.e. Central, dialect):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.ws/rpontisso/alphabet.html|title=The Furlan / Friulian Alphabet|author=|date=|website=www.geocities.ws|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Long vowels are indicated with a [[circumflex]]: {{angbr|â ê î ô û}}.
* {{angbr|e}} is used for both {{IPA|/ɛ/}} (which only occurs in stressed syllables) and {{IPA|/e/}}; similarly, {{angbr|o}} is used for both {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}.
* {{IPA|/j/}} is spelled {{angbr|j}} word-initially, and {{angbr|i}} elsewhere.
* {{IPA|/w/}} occurs primarily in diphthongs, and is spelled {{angbr|u}}.
* {{IPA|/s/}} is normally spelled {{angbr|s}}, but is spelled {{angbr|ss}} between vowels (in this context, a single {{angbr|s}} is pronounced {{IPA|/z/}}).
* {{IPA|/ɲ/}} is spelled {{angbr|gn}}, which can also occur word-finally.
* {{IPA|[ŋ]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}}, found word-finally, before word-final ''-s'', and often in the prefix ''in-''. Both sounds are spelled {{angbr|n}}.
* {{IPA|/k/}} is normally spelled {{angbr|c}}, but {{angbr|ch}} before {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|i}}, as in Italian.
* {{IPA|/ɡ/}} is normally spelled {{angbr|g}}, but {{angbr|gh}} before {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|i}}, again as in Italian.
* The palatal stops {{IPA|/c ɟ/}} are spelled {{angbr|cj gj}}. Note that in some dialects, these sounds are pronounced {{IPA|[tʃ dʒ]}}, as described above.
* {{IPA|/tʃ/}} is spelled {{angbr|c}} before {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|i}}, {{angbr|ç}} elsewhere. Note that in some dialects, this sound is pronounced {{IPA|[s]}}.
* {{IPA|/dʒ/}} is spelled {{angbr|z}}. Note that in some dialects, this sound is pronounced {{IPA|[z]}}.
* {{angbr|z}} can also represent {{IPA|/ts/}} or {{IPA|/dz/}} in certain words (e.g. ''nazion'' "nation", ''lezion'' "lesson").
* {{angbr|h}} is silent.
* {{angbr|q}} is no longer used except in the traditional spelling of certain proper names; similarly for {{angbr|g}} before {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|i}}.

===Long vowels and their origin===
Long vowels are typical of the Friulian language and greatly influence the Friulian pronunciation of Italian.

Friulian distinguishes between short and long vowels: in the following [[minimal pair]]s (long vowels are marked in the official orthography with a [[circumflex]] accent):
: ''lat'' (milk)
: ''lât'' (gone)
: ''fis'' (fixed, dense)
: ''fîs'' (sons)
: ''lus'' (luxury)
: ''lûs'' (light n.)

Friulian dialects differ in their treatment of long vowels. In certain dialects, some of the long vowels are actually diphthongs. The following chart shows how six words (''sêt'' thirst, ''pît'' foot, ''fîl'' "wire", ''pôc'' (a) little, ''fûc'' fire, ''mûr'' "wall") are pronounced in four dialects. Each dialect uses a unique pattern of diphthongs (yellow) and monophthongs (blue) for the long vowels:

Note that the vowels ''î'' and ''û'' in the standard language (based on the Central dialects) correspond to two different sounds in the Western dialects (including Codroipo). These sounds are not distributed randomly but correspond to different origins: Latin short {{sc|e}} in an open syllable produces Western {{IPA|[ei]}} but Central {{IPA|[iː]}}, whereas Latin long {{sc|ī}} produces {{IPA|[iː]}} in both dialects. Similarly, Latin short {{sc|o}} in an open syllable produces Western {{IPA|[ou]}} but Central {{IPA|[uː]}}, whereas Latin long {{sc|ū}} produces {{IPA|[uː]}} in both dialects. The word ''mûr'', for example, means both "wall" (Latin {{sc|mūrum}}) and "(he, she, it) dies" (Vulgar Latin *{{sc|morit}} from Latin {{sc|moritur}}); both words are pronounced {{IPA|[muːr]}} in Central dialects, but respectively {{IPA|[muːr]}} and {{IPA|[mour]}} in Western dialects.

Long consonants (ll, rr, and so on), frequently used in Italian, are usually absent in Friulian.

Friulian long vowels originate primarily from vowel lengthening in stressed [[open syllable]]s when the following vowel was lost.&lt;ref name="pilar"&gt;{{Citation
| last  = Prieto
| first = Pilar
| title = Compensatory Lengthening by Vowel and Consonant Loss in Early Friulian
| journal = Catalan Working Papers in Linguistics
| year    = 1992
| pages   = 205–244
| url     = http://www.raco.cat/index.php/CatalanWP/article/viewFile/74015/91197
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friulian vowel length has no relation to vowel length in Classical Latin. For example, Latin {{smallcaps|valet}} yields ''vâl'' "it is worth" with a long vowel, but Latin {{smallcaps|vallem}} yields ''val'' "valley" with a short vowel. Long vowels aren't found when the following vowel is preserved, e.g.:
* before final -e &lt; Latin {{smallcaps|-a}}, cf. short ''nuve'' "new (fem. sg.)" &lt; Latin {{smallcaps|nova}} vs. long ''nûf'' "new (masc. sg.)" &lt; Latin {{smallcaps|novum}};
* before a non-final preserved vowel, cf. ''tivit'' /ˈtivit/ "tepid, lukewarm" &lt; Latin {{smallcaps|tepidum}}, ''zinar'' /ˈzinar/ "son-in-law" &lt; Latin {{smallcaps|generum}}, ''ridi'' /ˈridi/ "to laugh" &lt; Vulgar Latin {{smallcaps|*rīdere}} (Classical {{smallcaps|rīdēre}}).

It is quite possible that vowel lengthening occurred originally in all stressed open syllables, and was later lost in non-final syllables.&lt;ref name="loporcaro"&gt;{{Citation
| last = Loporcaro
| first = Michele
| contribution = (Too much) synchrony within diachrony? Vowel length in Milanese.
| title = GLOW Phonology Workshop
| year = 2005
| url = http://www.vanoostendorp.nl/linguist/glow2005/wsloporcaro.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this is found, for example, in the divergent outcome of Vulgar Latin {{IPA|*/ɛ/}}, which becomes {{IPA|/jɛ/}} in originally closed syllables but {{IPA|/i(ː)/}} in Central Friulian in originally open syllables, including when non-finally. Examples: ''siet'' "seven" &lt; Vulgar Latin {{IPA|*/sɛtte/}} &lt; Latin {{sc|septem}}, word-final ''pît'' "foot" &lt; Vulgar Latin {{IPA|*/pɛde/}} &lt; Latin {{sc|pedem}}, non-word-final ''tivit'' {{IPA|/ˈtivit/}} "tepid, lukewarm" &lt; Vulgar Latin {{IPA|*/tɛpedu/}} &lt; Latin {{sc|tepidum}}. 

An additional source of vowel length is [[compensatory lengthening]] before lost consonants in certain circumstances, cf. ''pâri'' "father" &lt; Latin {{smallcaps|patrem}}, ''vôli'' "eye" &lt; Latin {{smallcaps|oc(u)lum}}, ''lîre'' "pound" &lt; Latin {{smallcaps|libra}}. This produces long vowels in non-final syllables, and was apparently a separate, later development than the primary lengthening in open syllables. Note, for example, the development of Vulgar Latin {{IPA|*/ɛ/}} in this context: {{IPA|*/ɛ/}} &gt; {{IPA|*/jɛ/}} &gt; ''iê'' {{IPA|/jeː/}}, as in ''piêre'' "stone" &lt; Latin {{sc|petram}}, differing from the outcome {{IPA|/i(ː)/}} in originally open syllables (see above).

Additional complications:
* Central Friulian has lengthening before /r/ even in originally closed syllables, cf. ''cjâr'' /caːr/ "cart" &lt; Latin {{smallcaps|carrum}} (homophonous with ''cjâr'' "dear (masc. sg.)" &lt; Latin {{smallcaps|cārum}}). This represents a late, secondary development, and some conservative dialects have the expected length distinction here.
* Lengthening doesn't occur before [[nasal consonant]]s even in originally open syllables, cf. ''pan'' /paŋ/ "bread" &lt; Latin {{smallcaps|panem}}, ''prin'' /priŋ/ "first" &lt; Latin {{smallcaps|prīmum}}.
* Special developments produced absolutely word-final long vowels and length distinctions, cf. ''fi'' "fig" &lt; Latin {{sc|fīcum}} vs. ''fî'' "son" &lt; Latin {{sc|fīlium}}, ''no'' "no" &lt; Latin {{sc|nōn}} vs. ''nô'' "we" &lt; Latin {{sc|nōs}}.

[[Synchrony (linguistics)|Synchronic]] analyses of vowel length in Friulian often claim that it occurs predictably in final syllables before an underlying voiced [[obstruent]], which is then devoiced.&lt;ref name="torres"&gt;{{Citation

| url     = http://roa.rutgers.edu/content/article/files/1464_francesc_torrestamarit_1.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyses of this sort have difficulty with long-vowel contrasts that occur non-finally (e.g. ''pâri'' "father" mentioned above) or not in front of obstruents (e.g. ''fi'' "fig" vs. ''fî'' "son", ''val'' "valley" vs. ''vâl'' "it is worth").

== Morphology ==
Friulian is quite different from Italian in its morphology; it is, in many respects, closer to [[French language|French]].

=== Nouns ===
In Friulian as in other [[Romance languages]], [[noun]]s are either [[grammatical gender|masculine or feminine]] (for example, "''il mûr''" ("the wall", masculine), "''la cjadree''" ("the chair", feminine).

==== Feminine ====
Most feminine nouns end in ''-e'', which is pronounced, unlike in Standard French:

* ''cjase'' = house (from Latin "casa, -ae" hut)
* ''lune'' = moon (from Latin "luna, -ae")
* ''scuele'' = school (from Latin "schola, -ae")

Some feminine nouns, however, end in a consonant, including those ending in ''-zion'', which are from [[Latin]].
* ''man'' = hand (from Latin "manŭs, -ūs" f)
* ''lezion'' = lesson (from Latin "lectio, -nis" f)

==== Masculine ====
Most masculine nouns end either in a consonant or in ''-i''.
* ''cjan'' = dog
* ''gjat'' = cat
* ''fradi'' = brother
* ''libri'' = book

A few masculine nouns end in ''-e'', including ''sisteme'' (system) and ''probleme'' (problem). They are usually words coming from [[Ancient Greek]]. However, because most masculine nouns end in a consonant, it is common to find the forms ''sistem'' and ''problem'' instead, more often in print than in speech.

There are also a number of masculine nouns borrowed intact from [[Italian language|Italian]], with a final ''-o'', like ''treno'' (train). Many of the words have been fully absorbed into the language and even form their plurals with the regular Friulian ''-s'' rather than the Italian [[desinence]] changing. Still, there are some purists, including those influential in Friulian publishing, who frown on such words and insist that the "proper" Friulian terms should be without the final ''-o''. Despite the fact that one almost always hears ''treno'', it is almost always written ''tren''.

=== Articles ===
The Friulian [[article (grammar)|definite article]] (which corresponds to "the" in English) is derived from the Latin ''ille'' and takes the following forms:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|+ [[Definite article]]s
|-
! Number
! Masculine
! Feminine
|-
| '''Singular'''
| il
| la
|-
| '''Plural'''
| i
| lis
|}
Before a vowel, both ''il'' and ''la'' can be abbreviated to l'{{example needed|date=May 2018}} in the standard forms. In the spoken language, various other articles are used.&lt;ref&gt;In Northern Friuli, ''el'' is used instead of 'il''. In Southern and Western Friuli, ''al'' is used instead of ''il''. In Northern Friuli, ''li'' or ''las'' is used instead of ''lis'' and ''le'' instead of ''la''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The indefinite article in Friulian (which corresponds to "a" and ''an'' in English) derives from the Latin ''unus'' and varies according to gender:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|+ [[Indefinite article]]s
|-
! Masculine
| un
|-
! Feminine
| une
|}

A partitive article also exists: '''des''' for feminine and '''dai''' for masculine: ''des vacjis'' – ''some cows'' and ''dai libris'' - ''some books''

=== Adjectives ===
A Friulian [[adjective]] must agree in gender and number with the noun it qualifies. Most adjectives have four forms for singular (masculine and feminine) and plural (masculine and feminine):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|+ Declination
|-
! Number
! Masculine
! Feminine
|-
| '''Singular'''
| brut
| brute
|-
| '''Plural'''
| bruts
| brutis
|}

Note that in some areas, the feminine is pronounced with different vowels: plural ''brutes'', ''brutas'', or singular ''bruta'', ''bruto''.

The feminine is formed in several ways from the masculine:
* in most cases, all that is needed is -e (''curt'', ''curte'')
* if the final letter is a -c, the feminine can end with -cje, -gje, -che, -ghe
* if the final letter is a -f, the feminine can end with -ve
* if the final letter is a -p, the feminine can end with -be
* if the final letter is a -t, the feminine can end with -de

=== Plurals ===
To form the plural of masculine and feminine nouns ending in -e, the -e is changed to -is.
* ''taule'', ''taulis'' = table, tables
* ''cjase'', ''cjasis'' = house, houses
* ''lune'', ''lunis'' = moon, moons
* ''scuele'', ''scuelis'' = school, schools
* ''sisteme'', ''sistemis'' = system, systems
* ''manece'', ''manecis'' = glove, gloves
* ''gnece'', ''gnecis'' = niece, nieces

The plural of almost all other nouns is just -s. It is always pronounced as voiceless [s], as in [[English language|English]] ''cats'', never as voiced [z], as in ''dogs''.
* ''man'', ''mans'' = hand, hands
* ''lezion'', ''lezions'' = lesson, lessons
* ''cjan'', ''cjans'' = dog, dogs
* ''gjat'', ''gjats'' = cat, cats
* ''fradi'', ''fradis'' = brother, brothers
* ''libri'', ''libris'' = book, books
* ''tren'', ''trens'' = train, trains
* ''braç'', ''braçs'' = arm, arms (from Latin "bracchium")
* ''guant'', ''guants'' = glove, gloves (compare English "gauntlet")

In some Friulian dialects, there are many words whose final consonant becomes silent when the -s is added. The words include just about all those whose singular form ends in -t. The plural of ''gjat'', for example, is written as ''gjats'' but is pronounced in much of Friuli as if it were ''gjas''. The plural of ''plat'' 'dish', though written as ''plats'', is often pronounced as ''plas''. Other words in this category include ''clâf'' (key) and ''clap'' (stone), whose plural forms, clâfs and claps, are often pronounced with no f or p, respectively (clâs, clas) so the longer a in the former is all that distinguishes it from the latter. Note also that a final -ç, which is pronounced either as the [[English language|English]] "-ch" (in central Friulian) or as "-s", is pluralized in writing as -çs, regardless of whether the pluralized pronunciation is "-s" or "-ts" (it varies according to dialect): messaç / messaçs (message).

==== Exceptions ====
Masculine nouns ending in -l or -li form their plurals by palatalising final -l or -li to -i.
* ''cjaval'', ''cjavai'' = horse, horses (from Latin "caballus")
* ''fîl'', ''fîi'' = string, strings (from Latin "filum")
* ''cjapiel'', ''cjapiei'' = hat, hats
* ''cjaveli'', ''cjavei'' = hair, hairs
* ''voli'', ''voi'' = eye, eyes
* ''zenoli'', ''zenoi'' = knee, knees (from Latin "genu")
Notice how these very often correspond to French nouns that form an irregular plural in -''x'': ''cheval-chevaux, chapeau-chapeaux, cheveu-cheveux, oeil-yeux, genou-genoux''.

Feminine nouns ending in -l have regular plurals.
* ''piel'', ''piels'' = skin, skins
* ''val'', ''vals'' (in northern Friulian also "tal", "tals") = valley, valleys

Masculine nouns ending in -st form their plurals by palatalising the final -t to -cj
* ''cavalarist'', ''cavalariscj'' = military horseman, military horsemen
* ''test'', ''tescj'' = text, texts

Some masculine nouns ending in -t form their plurals by palatalising the final -t to -cj:
* ''dint'', ''dincj'' = tooth, teeth (from Latin "dens, -tis")
* ''dut'', ''ducj'' = all (of one thing), all (of several things) (from Latin "totus")

Nouns ending in "s" do not change spelling in the plural, but some speakers may pronounce the plural -s differently from the singular -s.
* ''vues'' = bone, bones
* ''pes'' = fish (singular or plural) (from Latin "piscis")
* ''mês'' = month, months (from Latin "mensis")

The plural of ''an'' (year) has several forms depending on dialect, including ''ain'', ''ains'', ''agn'' and ''agns''. Regardless of pronunciation, the written form is ''agns''.
The same happens for the adjective ''bon'' (good), as its plural is ''bogns''.

=== Clitic subject pronouns ===
A feature of Friulian are the clitic [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] [[pronoun]]s. Known in Friulian as ''pleonastics'', are never stressed; they are used together with the verbs to express the subject and can be found before the [[verb]] in [[Sentence (linguistics)#Classification by purpose|declarative sentences]] or immediately after it in case of [[Question|interrogative]] or vocative (''optative'') sentences.

An example: ''jo o lavori'' means "I work"; ''jo lavorio?'' means "Do I work?", while ''lavorassio'' means "I wish I worked".

=== Verbs ===
* Friulian verbal [[infinitive]]s have one of four endings, -â, -ê, -i, -î; removing the ending gives the root, used to form the other forms (''fevel – â'', to speak), but in the case of irregular verbs, the root changes. They are common (''jessi'', to be, ''vê'', to have, ''podê'', to be able to). Frequently people use verbs in combination with adverbs to restrict the meaning.

=== Adverbs ===
An adjective can be made into an [[adverb]] by adding -mentri to the ending of the feminine singular form of the adjective (''lente'' becomes ''lentementri'', slowly), but it can sometimes&lt;ref&gt;Such is the case of FriulIan adjectives deriving from Latin adjectives of the second class.&lt;/ref&gt; lose the -e of the adjective (''facile'' becomes ''facilmentri'', easily). It is more common in the written language; in the spoken language people frequently use other forms or locutions (''a planc'' for slowly).

== Vocabulary ==
Most vocabulary is derived from Latin, with substantial phonological and morphological changes throughout its history. Therefore, many words are shared with the [[Romance languages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://borel.slu.edu/crubadan/table.html|title=Language similarity table|author=|date=|website=slu.edu|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Here the composition:
* [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] (9%) words are many, because the substrate of the Vulgar Latin spoken in Friuli, was the Karn-Celtic language. ("bâr", wood; "clap/crap", stone;"cjâr", plow; "crot", frog)
* Modern [[German language|German]]  (10%) words were introduced in particular in the [[Middle Ages]], during the [[Patrie dal Friûl]], when the influence from this culture was quite strong (''bearç'', backyard).
* [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] (3%) words were brought by [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] (mostly [[Alpine Slavs|Alpine Slavic]]) immigrants called several times to [[Friuli]] to repopulate lands devastated by [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] invasions in the 10th century (''cjast'', barn; ''zigâ'', to shout). Furthermore, many Slavic words have entered Friulian through the centuries-long neighbouring between Friulians and [[Slovenes]], especially in north-eastern Friuli ([[Slavia Friulana]]) and in the [[Gorizia and Gradisca]] area. Words such as ''colaç'' (cake), ''cudiç'' (devil) and ''cos'' (basket) are all of [[Slovene language|Slovene]] origin. There are also many toponyms with Slavic roots.
* There are many words that have Germanic (8%, probably [[Lombardic_language|Lombardic]] origins) and Celtic roots (what still remained of the languages spoken before the Romans came). Examples of the first category are ''sbregâ'', to tear; ''sedon'', spoon; ''taponâ'', to cover. For the latter category, ''troi'', path; ''bragons'', trousers.
* Latin and derived languages (68%):
** [[Venetian language]] influenced Friulian vocabulary: ''canucje'', straw.
** Some [[French language|French]] words entered the Friulian vocabulary: ''pardabon'', really and ''gustâ'', to have lunch.
** [[Italian language|Italian]]  itself has a growing influence on Friulian vocabulary, especially as far as neologisms are concerned (''tren'' meaning train). Such neologisms are currently used even if they not accepted in the official dictionary. The 
* Scientific terms are often of Greek origin, and there are also some [[Arabic languages|Arabic]] terms in Friulian (&lt;1%, ''lambic'', still)
* Many [[English language|English]] words (such as computer, monitor, mouse and so on) have entered the Friulian vocabulary through Italian. (more than 1%)

== Present condition ==
Nowadays, Friulian is officially recognized in [[Italy]], supported by law 482/1999, which protects linguistic minorities. Therefore, optional teaching of Friulian has been introduced in many primary schools. An online newspaper is active, and there are also a number of musical groups singing in Friulian and some theatrical companies. Recently, two movies have been made in Friulian (''Tierç lion'', ''Lidrîs cuadrade di trê''), with positive reviews in Italian newspapers. In about 40% of the communities in the [[Province of Udine]], road signs are in both Friulian and Italian. There is also an official translation of the [[Bible]]. In 2005, a notable brand of beer used Friulian for one of its commercials.

The main association to foster the use and development of Friulian is the ''Societât filologjiche furlane'', founded in [[Gorizia]] in 1919.

=== Toponyms ===
{{Main article|List of Friulian place names}}
[[File:Road sign in Friulian.jpg|thumb|Road sign in Italian and Friulian.]]
Every city and village in Friuli has two [[List of Friulian place names|names]], one in [[Italian language|Italian]] and one in Friulian. Only the Italian is official and used in administration, but it is widely expected that the Friulian ones will receive partial acknowledgement in the near future. For example, the city of [[Udine]] is called ''Udin'' in Friulian, the town of [[Tolmezzo]] ''Tumieç'' and the town of [[Aviano]] is called both Avian and Pleif.

== Standardisation ==
A challenge that Friulian shares with other minorities is to create a standard language and a unique writing system. The regional law 15/1996 approved a standard orthography, which represents the basis of a common variant and should be used in toponyms, official acts, written documents. The standard is based on Central Friulian, which was traditionally the language used in literature already in 1700 and afterwards (the biggest examples are probably Pieri Çorut's works) but with some changes:
* the [[diphthong]] ''ie'' replaces ''ia'': ''fier (iron)'' instead of ''fiar'', ''tiere (soil, earth)'' instead of ''tiare''.
* the use of ''vu'' instead of ''u'' at the beginning of word: ''vueli (oil)'' instead of ''ueli '', ''vueit (empty)'' instead of ''ueit''.
* the use of ''i'' between vocals: ''ploie (rain)'' instead of ''ploe''.

Standard Friulian is called in Friulian ''furlan standard'', ''furlan normalizât'' or from [[Greek language|Greek]], ''[[Koiné language|coinè]]''.

=== Criticism ===
There have been several critics of the standardisation of Friulian, mainly from speakers of local variants that differ substantially from the proposed standard; they also argue that the standard could eventually kill local variants. The supporters of standardisation refer to the various advantages that a unique form can bring to the language. Above all, it can help to stop the influence of [[Italian language]] in the [[neologism]]s, which pose a serious threat to Friulian's future development. They also point out that it is a written standard without affecting pronunciation, which can follow local variants.

Opponents of the standardisation, on the other hand, insist that the standard language, being artificially created, is totally inadequate to represent the local variations, particularly from differences in the phonetic pronunciation of the words in each variant that may, in some cases, even require special and different diacritics for writing a single variant.

=== Variants of Friulian ===
Four dialects of Friulian can be at least distinguished, all [[mutually intelligible languages|mutually intelligible]]. They are usually distinguished by the last vowel of many parts of speech (including nouns, adjectives, adverbs), following this scheme:
* Central Friulian, spoken around [[Udine]] has words ending with -e. It is used in official documents and generally considered standard. Some people see it as the least original but one of the most recent variants since it does not show interesting features found in other variants, as it has Venetian influence.
* Northern Friulian, spoken in [[Carnia]], has several variants. The language can vary with the valleys and words can end in -o, -e or -a. It is the most archaic variant.
* Southeastern Friulian, spoken in [[Bassa Friulana]] and Isontino and in the area along the [[Isonzo]] River (the area of the old [[Gorizia and Gradisca|Contea di Gorizia e Gradisca]]) has words that end with -a. This variant has been known since the origins of the language and was used as official literary language by the Friulians of the Austrian Empire. It was influenced by German and Slavic.
* Western Friulian, including Pordenonese, is spoken in the [[Province of Pordenone]] and is also called ''concordiese'', from [[Concordia Sagittaria]]. Words end with -a or -e, but the strong Venetian influence, makes it be considered one of the most corrupted variants.

The word for ''home'' is ''cjase'' in Central Friulian and ''cjasa'' or ''cjaso'' in other areas. [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] wrote his works in Western Friulian since he learned the language from his mother who was from [[Casarsa della Delizia|Casarsa/Cjasarsa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pasolini.net/casarsa_casaPasolini.htm|title=casarsa_casa Pasolini (Colussi) a Casarsa|author=|date=|website=pasolini.net|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Pordenone]].

In the 13th century, early literary works in Friulian were based on the language spoken in Cividale del Friuli, which was the most important town in Friuli. The endings in -o, which now is restricted to some villages in [[Carnia]]. Later, the main city of [[Friuli]] became [[Udine]] and the most common ending was -a; only from the 16th century on, -e endings were used in standard Friulian.

== Writing systems ==
{{expand section|date=July 2012}}
[[File:Udine-targaUniversitatdalFriul.jpg|thumb|Sign of the Universitât dâl Friûl in Udine]]
In the official writing system, approved by the [[Province of Udine]] and used in official documents, Friulian is written using the [[Latin script]] with the c-[[cedilla]] (ç). The letter q is used only for personal names and historical toponyms, and in every other case, it is replaced by c. Besides that, k, x, w, and y appear only in loan words so they are not considered part of the alphabet.
:Aa Bb Cc Çç Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Zz
There are also [[grave accent]]s (à, è, ì, ò and ù) and [[circumflex accent]]s (â, ê, î, ô, and û), which are put above the [[vowel]]s to distinguish between homophonic words or to show stress (the former) and show long vowels (the latter).

=== Other systems ===
An alternative system is called [[Faggin-Nazzi]] from the names of the scholars who proposed it. It is less common, probably also because it is more difficult for a beginner for its use of letters, such as č, that are typical of [[Slavic languages]] but seem foreign to native Italian speakers.

The presence of '''Ghanaians in Italy''' dates back to the 1980s.

==Numbers==
In 2010 in [[Italy]] there are 46,890 regular immigrants from [[Ghana]]. In 2006 there were 36,540. The three cities with most number of Ghanaians are: [[Palermo]], [[Modena]] and [[Reggio Emilia]].&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/statistiche/stranieri/gh.html|title= Comuni Italiani|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:MBalotelli Nazionale.jpg|thumb|left|The footballer [[Mario Balotelli]] an Italian of [[Ghanaian people|Ghanaian]] descent]]
In Italy the migration from Ghana began in the mid-1980s, when people came over as students driven by economic motives.

The choice of Italy as a place of destination, it is often due to the ease of obtaining an entry visa, and the difficulty of obtaining an entry permit for other European countries. In fact initially the preferred destinations are Britain, then Germany and the United States, but many of them, the first citation is available and has been for Italy.
Towards the year 1988 also was easier to get a visa for Italy because there were few immigrants, but Britain was more rigid because many Ghanaians actually entered as tourists stayed permanently.
The guys of the second generation who were born in Italy, studying, trying to carve out a space, to achieve a respectable economic independence and parents work very hard to guarantee them a relative stability.

==Entrepreneurship==
''Ghanacoop'' was born in [[Modena]] in 2005 within the National Association of [[Ghana]] and it is one of the first non-profit social enterprises run by immigrants on the Italian territory. It's a concrete example of community enterprise, involving an entire community as a whole of its economic activities, social or cultural.
The farm, which involves 135 workers cultivating an area of 400 hectares, exports its products to the British market and, through Ghanacoop, on the Italian market. On the local market the product is sold to both distributors of fresh produce, and for firms engaged in processing for the production of juices, fruit concentrates and fruit cut, or, in the Italian business vocabulary, fourth range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GhanaCoop |url=http://www.migrantiebanche.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=106:imprenditoria-migrante-un-esempio-per-tuttiecco-a-voi-ghanacoop&amp;catid=45:imprenditoria-migrante&amp;Itemid=12 |year=2007 |location=Modena |first= |last= |accessdate=1 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703195332/http://www.migrantiebanche.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=106%3Aimprenditoria-migrante-un-esempio-per-tuttiecco-a-voi-ghanacoop&amp;catid=45%3Aimprenditoria-migrante&amp;Itemid=12 |archivedate=3 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green politics''' (also known as '''ecopolitics''')&lt;ref name="ReedRothenberg1993"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Reed|author2=David Rothenberg|title=Wisdom in the Open Air: The Norwegian Roots of Deep Ecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lijSesXIxz0C&amp;pg=PA84|year=1993|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-2182-8|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[political ideology]] that aims to create an ecologically sustainable society rooted in [[environmentalism]], [[nonviolence]], [[social justice]] and [[grassroots democracy]].&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;[[#Wal10|Wall 2010]]. p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; It began taking shape in the western world in the 1970s and since then Green parties have developed and established themselves in many countries around the globe and have achieved some electoral success.

The political term ''Green'' was used initially in relation to [[Alliance '90/The Greens|''die Grünen'']] ([[German language|German]] for "the Greens"),&lt;ref name="Wall2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Derek Wall|title=The No-nonsense Guide to Green Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AYHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|year=2010|publisher=New Internationalist|isbn=978-1-906523-39-8|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burchell2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon Burchell|title=The Evolution of Green Politics: Development and Change Within European Green Parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fObWMwv7TqwC&amp;pg=PA52|year=2002|publisher=Earthscan|isbn=978-1-85383-751-7|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Green party formed in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Playing by the Rules: The Impact of Electoral Systems on Emerging Green Parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m2Zp5nkbvPkC&amp;pg=PA79|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-13249-3|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[political ecology]]" is sometimes used in academic circles, but in the latter has come to represent an interdisciplinary field of study, as the academic discipline offers wide-ranging studies integrating ecological social sciences with [[political economy]]&lt;ref&gt;Peet and Watts, 1996, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; in topics such as degradation and marginalization, environmental conflict, conservation and control and environmental identities and social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of green politics share many ideas with the [[Ecology movement|ecology]], [[Conservation movement|conservation]], [[Environmental movement|environmentalism]], [[Feminist movement|feminism]] and [[peace movement]]s. In addition to democracy and ecological issues, green politics is concerned with [[civil liberties]], social justice, nonviolence, sometimes variants of [[Localism (politics)|localism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AaBFGNXjljsC&amp;pg=PA394|title=Green Politics, An A-to-Z Guide|author=Dustin Mulvaney|publisher=SAGE publications|year=2011|page=394}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tends to support [[social progressivism]]. The party's platform is largely considered [[Left-wing politics|left]] in the political spectrum.

The Green ideology has connections with various other ecocentric political ideologies, including [[ecosocialism]], [[ecoanarchism]] and [[ecofeminism]], but to what extent these can be seen as forms of Green politics is a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal10|Wall 2010]]. p. 47-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the left-wing Green (i.e. capital 'G') political philosophy developed, there also came into separate existence unrelated and polar opposite movements on the right that include ecological components such as [[green conservatism]] and [[eco-capitalism]].

==History==
[[File:Portrait Gandhi.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Ghandism]].]]
[[File:Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|thumb|120px|right|[[Henry David Thoreau]], influential early green anarchist who wrote ''[[Walden]]'']]
===Influences===
Adherents to green politics tend to consider it to be part of a 'higher' worldview and not simply a political ideology. Green politics draws its ethical stance from a variety of sources, from the values of [[indigenous peoples]], to the ethics of [[Mohandas Gandhi|Gandhi]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Jakob von Uexküll|Uexküll]]. These people influenced green thought in their advocacy of long-term "[[seven generation sustainability|seventh generation]]" foresight, and on the personal responsibility of every individual to make moral choices.

Of course, unease about adverse consequences of human actions on nature predates the modern concept of “environmentalism". Social commentators as far apart as ancient Rome and China complained of air, water and [[noise pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keys|first=David|title=How Rome polluted the world|journal=Geographical|volume=75|number=12|date=December 2003|url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-111733101/how-rome-polluted-the-world-we-tend-to-think-of-industrial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical roots of environmentalism can be traced back to enlightenment thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] in France and, later, the author and naturalist [[Thoreau]] in America. Organised environmentalism began in late 19th Century Europe and the United States as a reaction to the [[Industrial Revolution]] with its emphasis on unbridled economic expansion.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, John. ''The Global Environmental Movement'' (London: John Wiley, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

“Green politics” first began as conservation and preservation movements, such as the [[Sierra Club]], founded in San Francisco in 1892.

Left-green platforms of the form that make up the green parties today draw terminology from the science of ecology, and policy from [[environmentalism]], [[deep ecology]], [[feminism]], [[pacifism]], [[anarchism]], [[libertarian socialism]], [[social democracy]], [[eco-socialism]], and/or [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]]. In the 1970s, as these movements grew in influence, green politics arose as a new philosophy which synthesized their goals.
The Green Party political movement is not to be confused with the unrelated fact that in some far-right and fascist parties, nationalism has on occasion been tied into a sort of green politics which promotes environmentalism as a form of pride in the "motherland"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter|last=Staudenmaier|title=Fascist Ecology: The 'Green Wing' of the Nazi Party and its Historical Antecedents.|url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/germany/sp001630/peter.html|accessdate=24 March 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080313141128/http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/germany/sp001630/peter.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 13 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

====Early development====
In June 1970 in the [[Netherlands]] a group called [[Kabouters]] won 5 of the 45 seats on the [[Amsterdam]] Gemeenteraad (City Council), as well as two seats each on councils in [[The Hague]] and [[Leeuwarden]] and one seat apiece in [[Arnhem]], [[Alkmaar]] and [[Leiden]]. The Kabouters were an outgrowth of [[Provo (movement)|Provo]]’s environmental White Plans and they proposed “Groene Plannen” (“Green Plans”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kempton|first1=Richard|title=Amsterdam’s Anarchist Revolt|url=http://madgorilla.org/kempton/provos.pdf|publisher=The Provos|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first political party to be created with its basis in environmental issues was the [[United Tasmania Group]], founded in Australia in March 1972 to fight against deforestation and the creation of a dam that would damage [[Lake Pedder]]; whilst it only gained three percent in state elections, it had, according to Derek Wall, "inspired the creation of Green parties all over the world."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal10|Wall 2010]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1972, a meeting at [[Victoria University of Wellington]], New Zealand, launched the ''[[Values Party]]'', the world's first countrywide green party to contest Parliamentary seats nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greens.org.nz/about/history.htm |title=The History of The Green Party |publisher=Greens.org.nz |date= |accessdate=16 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010175959/http://www.greens.org.nz/about/history.htm |archivedate=10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1972, Europe's first green party, PEOPLE in the UK came into existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.green-history.uk/articles/general/46-who-was-first |title=Green History UK-Who Was First? |publisher=Green-History.uk |date=28 August 2017 |accessdate=10 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911025431/http://www.green-history.uk/articles/general/46-who-was-first |archive-date=11 September 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Green Party was not the first Green Party in Europe to have members elected nationally but the impression was created that they had been, because they attracted the most media attention: The [[Alliance '90/The Greens|German Greens]], contended in their first national election in 1980. They started as a provisional coalition of civic groups and political campaigns which, together, felt their interests were not expressed by the conventional parties.  After contesting the 1979 Euro elections they held a conference which identified Four Pillars of the Green Party which all groups in the original alliance could agree as the basis of a common Party platform: welding these groups together as a single Party. This statement of principles has since been utilised by many Green Parties around the world. It was this party that first coined the term "Green" ("Grün" in German) and adopted the [[sunflower]] symbol. The term "Green" was coined by one of the founders of the German Green Party, [[Petra Kelly]], after she visited Australia and saw the actions of the [[Builders Labourers Federation]] and their [[green ban]] actions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Humphries|first1=David|title=Newsmaker: Green bans|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/newsmaker-green-bans-20120330-1w372.html|agency=Sydney Morning Herald|date=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the [[German federal election, 1983|1983 federal election]], the Greens won 27 seats in the [[Bundestag]].

The first Canadian foray into green politics took place in the Maritimes when 11 independent candidates (including one in Montreal and one in Toronto) ran in the 1980 federal election under the banner of the Small Party. Inspired by Schumacher's Small is Beautiful, the Small Party candidates ran for the expressed purpose of putting forward an anti-nuclear platform in that election. It was not registered as an official party, but some participants in that effort went on to form the [[Green Party of Canada]] in 1983 (the [[Green Party of Ontario|Ontario Greens]] and [[Green Party of British Columbia|British Columbia Greens]] were also formed that year). Current [[Green Party of Canada]] leader [[Elizabeth May]] was the instigator and one of the candidates of the Small Party and she was eventually elected as a member of the Green Party in [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 Canadian federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://greenparty.ca/en/party/history|title=The Green Movement|publisher=Green Party of Canada|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, in 1995, the [[Green League]] became the first European Green Party to form part of a state-level Cabinet. The German Greens followed, forming a government with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (the "[[Red-Green Alliance]]") from 1998 to 2005. In 2001, they reached an agreement to end reliance on [[nuclear power]] in Germany, and agreed to remain in coalition and support the German government of Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 Afghan War]]. This put them at odds with many Greens worldwide, but demonstrated that they were capable of difficult political tradeoffs.

In Latvia, [[Indulis Emsis]], leader of the Green Party and part of the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]], an alliance of a Nordic agrarian party and the Green Party, was [[Prime Minister of Latvia]] for ten months in 2004, making him the first [[Green party|Green]] politician to lead a country in the history of the world. In 2015, Emsis' party colleague, [[Raimonds Vējonis]], was elected President of Latvia by the Latvian parliament. Vējonis became the first green [[head of state]] worldwide.

In the German state of Baden-Württenburg, the Green Party became the leader of the coalition with the Social Democrats after finishing second in the [[Baden-Württemberg state election, 2011]]. In the following [[Baden-Württemberg state election, 2016|state election, 2016]], the Green Party became the strongest party for the first time in a German [[Landtag]].

In 2016, the former leader of the Austrian green party (1997-2008), [[Alexander Van der Bellen]], officially running as an independent, won the [[Austrian presidential election, 2016]], making him the second green head of state worldwide, the first directly elected by popular vote. Van der Bellen became second in the election's first round with 21.3% of the votes, the best result for the Austrian greens in their history. He won the second round run-off against the far-right Freedom party's [[Norbert Hofer]] with 53.8% of the votes, making him the first President of Austria who was not backed by either the People's or the Social Democratic party.

==Core tenets==
[[File:4pilarsgreens.png|thumb|278x278px|The four green pillars]]
According to [[Derek Wall]], a prominent British Green proponent, there are four pillars that define Green politics:&lt;ref name="Wall"/&gt;
*[[Ecology|Ecological wisdom]]
*[[Social justice]]
*[[Grassroots democracy]]
*[[Nonviolence]]

In 1984, the Green Committees of Correspondence in the United States expanded the Four Pillars into Ten Key Values which, in addition to the Four Pillars mentioned above, include:
*[[Decentralization]]
*[[Community-based economics]]
*Post-patriarchal values (later translated to [[feminism]])
*[[Respect for diversity]]
*Global responsibility
*Future focus
[[File:6pilarsgreens.png|thumb|283x283px|The six guiding principles]]
In 2001, the [[Global Greens]] were organized as an international Green movement. The [[Global Greens Charter]] identified six guiding principles:
*Ecological wisdom
*Social justice
*[[Participatory democracy]]
*Nonviolence
*[[Sustainability]]
*Respect for diversity

===Ecology===

===Economics===
{{Main|Green economics|Postgrowth|Communalism|Participatory economics}}
[[File:Tim Jackson, 2017 (cropped).jpg|thumb|140px|[[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]], professor of [[sustainable development]] and [[Ecological economics]] at the [[University of Surrey]] and author of [[Prosperity Without Growth]].]]

[[File:NLN Michael Albert.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Michael Albert]], theorist of [[Participatory economics]].]]
Green economics focuses on the importance of the health of the [[biosphere]] to [[Quality of life|human well-being]]. Consequently, most Greens distrust conventional capitalism, as it tends to emphasize [[economic growth]] while ignoring ecological health; the "[[full cost accounting|full cost]]" of economic growth often includes damage to the biosphere, which is unacceptable according to green politics. Green economics considers such growth to be "[[uneconomic growth]]"— material increase that nonetheless lowers overall quality of life. Green economics inherently takes a longer term perspective than conventional economics, because such loss in quality of life is often delayed. According to green economics, the present generation should not borrow from future generations, but rather attempt to achieve what [[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]] calls "prosperity without growth".

Some Greens refer to [[productivism]], [[consumerism]] and [[scientism]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as "grey", as contrasted with "green", economic views. "Grey" implies age, concrete, and lifelessness.

Therefore, adherents to green politics advocate economic policies designed to safeguard the environment. Greens want governments to stop [[subsidy|subsidizing]] companies that waste resources or pollute the natural world, subsidies that Greens refer to as "dirty subsidies". Some currents of green politics place automobile and agribusiness subsidies in this category, as they may harm human health. On the contrary, Greens look to a [[green tax shift]] that are seen to encourage both producers and consumers to make ecologically friendly choices.

Many aspects of green economics could be considered [[anti-globalization|anti-globalist]]. According to many left-wing greens, [[economic globalization]] is considered a threat to well-being, which will replace natural environments and local cultures with a single trade economy, termed the [[global economic monoculture]]. This is not a universal policy of greens, as [[green liberalism|green liberals]] and [[green conservatism|green conservatives]] support a regulated [[free market]] economy with additional measures to advance [[sustainable development]]

Since green economics emphasizes biospheric health and [[biodiversity]], an issue outside the traditional left-right spectrum, different currents within green politics incorporate ideas from socialism and capitalism. Greens on the Left are often identified as [[Eco-socialism|Eco-socialists]], who merge ecology and environmentalism with socialism and [[Marxism]] and blame the capitalist system for environmental degradation, social injustice, inequality and conflict.  [[Eco-capitalism|Eco-capitalists]], on the other hand, believe that the [[free market]] system, with some modification, is capable of addressing ecological problems. This belief is documented in the business experiences of eco-capitalists in the book, ''The Gort Cloud'' that describes the [[gort cloud]] as the green community that supports eco-friendly businesses.

===Participatory democracy===
Since the beginning, green politics has emphasized local, [[grassroots]]-level political activity and decision-making. According to its adherents, it is crucial that citizens play a direct role in the decisions that influence their lives and their environment. Therefore, green politics seeks to increase the role of [[deliberative democracy]], based on direct citizen involvement and [[consensus decision making]], wherever it is feasible.

Green politics also encourages political action on the individual level, such as [[ethical consumerism]], or buying things that are made according to environmentally ethical standards.  Indeed, many green parties emphasize individual and grassroots action at the local and regional levels over [[election|electoral politics]]. Historically, green parties have grown at the local level, gradually gaining influence and spreading to regional or provincial politics, only entering the national arena when there is a strong network of local support.

In addition, many Greens believe that governments should not levy taxes against strictly local production and trade. Some Greens advocate new ways of organizing authority to increase local control, including [[urban secession]], [[bioregional democracy]], and co-operative / local stakeholder ownership.

Although Greens in the [[Green Party (United States)|United States]] "call for an end to the '[[War on Drugs]]'" and "for decriminalization of [[victimless crimes]]", they also call for developing "a firm approach to law enforcement that directly addresses violent crime, including trafficking in hard drugs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gp.org/platform/2004/socjustice.html#1001998|title= Green Party of the United States platform: Criminal Justice|publisher=Green Party|date=2004|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, Green parties tend to support the creation of a democratic [[federal Europe]].

In the spirit of nonviolence, Green politics opposes the [[War on Terrorism]] and the curtailment of [[civil rights]], focusing instead on nurturing [[deliberative democracy]] in war-torn regions and the construction of a [[civil society]] with an increased role for women.

In keeping with their commitment to the preservation of diversity, greens are often committed to the maintenance and protection of indigenous communities, languages, and traditions. An example of this is the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Irish Green Party]]'s commitment to the preservation of the Irish Language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenparty.ie/assets/docs/Green%20Party%20Irish%20Language%20Policy%20in%20English%20(2014)-3.pdf|title=Green Party Irish Language Policy|date=2014|publisher=the Green Party of Ireland|format=pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702121432/http://greenparty.ie/assets/docs/Green%20Party%20Irish%20Language%20Policy%20in%20English%20(2014)-3.pdf|archivedate=2 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the green movement has focused on divesting in fossil fuels. [[Academics Stand Against Poverty]] states "it is paradoxical for universities to remain invested in fossil fuel companies". [[Thomas Pogge]] says that the fossil fuel divestment movement can increase political pressure at events like the  international climate change conference (COP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Emma|title=Top academics ask world's universities to divest from fossil fuels|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/07/top-academics-ask-worlds-universities-to-divest-from-fossil-fuels|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Epstein of Forbes notes that it is hypocritical to ask for divestment without a boycott and that a boycott would be more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Epstein|first1=Alex|title=The Moral Case For Investing, Not Divesting, In Fossil Fuels|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexepstein/2015/02/11/the-moral-case-for-investing-not-divesting-in-fossil-fuels/|accessdate=7 April 2015|agency=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some institutions that are leading by example in the academic area are [[Stanford University]], [[Syracuse University]], [[Sterling College (Vermont)|Sterling College]] and over 20 more. A number of cities, counties and religious institutions have also joined the movement to divest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Divestment Commitments|url=http://gofossilfree.org/commitments/|website=FossilFree.org|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syracuse University to divest fossil fuel investments|url=http://www.syracuse.com/schools/index.ssf/2015/04/syracuse_university_to_divest_fossil_fuel_investments.html|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green politics mostly [[anti-nuclear|opposes nuclear fusion power]] and the buildup of [[persistent organic pollutants]], supporting adherence to the [[precautionary principle]], by which technologies are rejected unless they can be proven to not cause significant harm to the health of living things or the [[biosphere]].

Green platforms generally favor tariffs on [[fossil fuels]], restricting [[genetically modified organisms]], and protections for [[ecoregions]] or [[communities]].

==Organization==

===Local movements===
[[File:Wangari Maathai no Brasil.jpg|thumb|[[Ecofeminism|Ecofeminist]] [[Wangari Maathai]].]]
Green ideology emphasizes [[participatory democracy]] and the principle of "[[Think Globally, Act Locally|thinking globally, acting locally]]".  As such, the ideal Green Party is thought to grow from the bottom up, from neighborhood to municipal to (eco-)regional to national levels.  The goal is to rule by a [[consensus decision-making|consensus decision making]] process.

Strong local coalitions are considered a pre-requisite to higher-level electoral breakthroughs. Historically, the growth of Green parties has been sparked by a single issue where Greens can appeal to ordinary citizens' concerns.  In Germany, for example, the Greens' early opposition to nuclear power won them their first successes in the federal elections.

===Global organization===
There is a growing level of global cooperation between Green parties.  Global gatherings of Green Parties now happen. The first Planetary Meeting of Greens was held 30–31 May 1992, in Rio de Janeiro, immediately preceding the [[Earth Summit (1992)|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] held there.  More than 200 Greens from 28 nations attended. The first formal Global Greens Gathering took place in [[Canberra]], in 2001, with more than 800 Greens from 72 countries in attendance.  The second Global Green Congress was held in São Paulo, Brazil, in May 2008, when 75 parties were represented.

Global Green networking dates back to 1990. Following the Planetary Meeting of Greens in [[Rio de Janeiro]], a Global Green Steering Committee was created, consisting of two seats for each continent. In 1993 this Global Steering Committee met in Mexico City and authorized the creation of a Global Green Network including a Global Green Calendar, Global Green Bulletin, and Global Green Directory. The Directory was issued in several editions in the next years. In 1996, 69 Green Parties from around the world signed a common declaration opposing French nuclear testing in the South Pacific, the first statement of global greens on a current issue. A second statement was issued in December 1997, concerning the Kyoto climate change treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgreens.org/ggn/brief-history-2003|title=Global Greens Network - a brief history up to 2003|author=John Rensenbrink|publisher=Global Greens|date=August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2001 Canberra Global Gathering delegates for Green Parties from 72 countries decided upon a [[Global Greens Charter]] which proposes six key principles. Over time, each Green Party can discuss this and organize itself to approve it, some by using it in the local press, some by translating it for their web site, some by incorporating it into their manifesto, some by incorporating it into their constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Greens / Green Party of Canada  Constitution|url=http://www.green.ca/english/members/constitution.shtml|website=green party of canada|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040218004310/http://www.green.ca/english/members/constitution.shtml|archivedate=18 February 2004|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is taking place gradually, with online dialogue enabling parties to say where they are up to with this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://greenparties.hpg.ig.com.br/virtual.html |title=iG - Notícias, Vídeos, Famosos, Esportes, Bate Papo, Infográficos |publisher=Greenparties.hpg.ig.com.br |date=17 September 2013 |accessdate=16 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402095954/http://www.greenparties.hpg.ig.com.br/virtual.html |archivedate=2 April 2003 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Green bloc at the Copenhagen climate demo FYEG (4186296292).jpg|thumb|[[Federation of Young European Greens]] demonstration in [[Copenhagen]], during the Climate Summit 2009.]]
The Gatherings also agree on organizational matters. The first Gathering voted unanimously to set up the ''Global Green Network'' (GGN). The GGN is composed of three representatives from each Green Party. A companion organization was set up by the same resolution: ''Global Green Coordination'' (GGC). This is composed of three representatives from each Federation (Africa, Europe, The Americas, Asia/Pacific, see below).  Discussion of the planned organization took place in several Green Parties prior to the Canberra meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Network of Green Parties|url=http://www.greens.org.au/bobbrown/global.htm|website=Australian Greens|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030301155622/http://www.greens.org.au/bobbrown/global.htm|archivedate=1 March 2003|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GGC communicates chiefly by email.  Any agreement by it has to be by unanimity of its members. It may identify possible global campaigns to propose to Green Parties worldwide. The GGC may endorse statements by individual Green Parties.  For example, it endorsed a statement by the US Green Party on the Israel-Palestine conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of the Global Green Coordination on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict|url=http://www.greenpartyus.org/press/pr_04_10_02.html|website=Green Party US|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030218053722/http://www.greenpartyus.org/press/pr_04_10_02.html|archivedate=18 February 2003|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly, Global Green Gatherings are an opportunity for informal networking, from which joint campaigning may arise. For example, a campaign to protect the [[New Caledonia]]n coral reef, by getting it nominated for World Heritage Status: a joint campaign by the New Caledonia Green Party, New Caldonian indigenous leaders, the [[French Green Party]], and the [[Australian Greens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgreens.org/sites/globalgreens.org/files/spinifex-4.pdf|title=Spinifex '''4''', Newsletter of the 2001 Global Greens Congress|publisher=Consensus Productions|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example concerns [[Ingrid Betancourt]], the leader of the Green Party in [[Colombia]], the Green Oxygen Party (''[[Partido Verde Oxigeno]]''). Ingrid Betancourt and the party's Campaign Manager, Claire Rojas, were kidnapped by a hard-line faction of [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] on 7 March 2002, while travelling in FARC-controlled territory. Betancourt had spoken at the Canberra Gathering, making many friends. As a result, Green Parties all over the world have organized, pressing their governments to bring pressure to bear. For example, Green Parties in African countries, Austria, Canada, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, France, Scotland, Sweden and other countries have launched campaigns calling for Betancourt's release. [[Bob Brown]], the leader of the [[Australian Greens]], went to Colombia, as did an envoy from the European Federation, [[Alain Lipietz]], who issued a report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alain LIPIETZ à BOGOTA du 3 au 5 mars 2002|url=http://www.providence.edu/polisci/affigne/free_ingrid.htm#Anchor-Lipietz|website=Providence College: Tony Affigne: Green parties of the world declare: "Free Ingrid Betancourt and Clara Rojas!"|language=French|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040216090122/http://www.providence.edu/polisci/affigne/free_ingrid.htm#Anchor-Lipietz|archivedate=16 February 2004|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four Federations of Green Parties issued a message to FARC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Parties of the World Call for Ingrid Betancout's Freedom|url=http://www.web.greens.org/~cls/gp/to-farc-ep|website=Green Parties world wide|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120094936/http://www.web.greens.org/~cls/gp/to-farc-ep|archivedate=20 November 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingrid Betancourt was rescued by the Colombian military in [[Operation Jaque]] in 2008.

====Global Green meetings====
[[File:Video Vandana Shiva 2014.webm|thumb|[[Vandana Shiva]] in [[Cologne, Germany]] in 2007|262x262px]]
Separately from the Global Green Gatherings, ''Global Green Meetings'' take place. For instance, one took place on the fringe of the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in Johannesburg.  Green Parties attended from Australia, Taiwan, Korea, South Africa, Mauritius, Uganda, Cameroon, Republic of Cyprus, Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Norway, the USA, Mexico and Chile.

The Global Green Meeting discussed the situation of Green Parties on the African continent; heard a report from [[Mike Feinstein]], former Mayor of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], about setting up a web site of the GGN; discussed procedures for the better working of the GGC; and decided two topics on which the Global Greens could issue statements in the near future: Iraq and the 2003 WTO meeting in Cancun.

===Green federations===
[[File:Bob Brown at 2008 climate change rally DSC 6368.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bob Brown]] at a [[climate change]] rally in [[Melbourne]] on 5 July 2008]]
Affiliated members in Asia, Pacific and Oceania form the [[Asia-Pacific Green Network]].
The member parties of the [[Global Greens]] are organised into four continental federations:
*[[Federation of Green Parties of Africa]]
*[[Federation of the Green Parties of the Americas|Federation of the Green Parties of the Americas / Federación de los Partidos Verdes de las Américas]]
*[[Asia-Pacific Green Network]]
*[[European Green Party]]

The European Federation of Green Parties formed itself as the [[European Green Party]] on 22 February 2004, in the run-up to [[European Parliament]] elections in June 2004, a further step in trans-national integration.

==Currents==
[[File:Murray Bookchin in Burlington.jpg|thumb|[[Murray Bookchin]] developed the theory of [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]].]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}Green politics is usually said to include the [[green anarchism]], [[eco-anarchism]], [[green libertarianism]], [[green liberalism]], [[anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] movements, and [[peace movement]]s, although these often claim not to be aligned with any party. Some claim it also includes [[feminism]], [[pacifism]] and the [[animal rights]] movements. Some Greens support policy measures to [[gender empowerment|empower women]], especially mothers, [[great ape personhood]]; to [[anti-war movement|oppose war]], to de-escalate conflicts, and to stop proliferating technologies useful in conflict or likely to lead to conflict.

Greens on the [[left-wing politics|Left]] adhere to [[eco-socialism]], an ideology that combines ecology, environmentalism, socialism, and [[Marxism]] to criticize the capitalist system as the cause of ecological crises, [[social exclusion]], [[social inequality|inequality]], and conflict. Green parties are not eco-socialist, but some Green parties around the world have or have had a significant eco-socialist membership.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Despite this stereotype, some [[radical centrism|centrist]] Greens may subscribe to a more [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] [[Georgism|Georgist]] or [[geolibertarianism|geolibertarian]] philosophy emphasizing individual [[right to property|property rights]] and [[free-market environmentalism]]{{spaced ndash}}and [[tax shift|shifting taxes]] away from value created by labor or service and charging instead for human consumption of the wealth created by the natural world (see ''[[land value tax]]'' and ''[[ecotax]]'').

Greens may view the processes by which living beings compete for mates, homes, and food, ecology, and the cognitive and political sciences very differently. These differences tend to drive debate on ethics, formation of policy, and the public resolution of these differences in leadership races. There is no single "Green Ethic".

She also sang in other languages like [[Hindi]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]], and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/10/stories/2007121060470500.htm|title=Singer L.R. Eswari felicitated |date=10 December 2007|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She has won [[Kalaimamani]], the Tamil Nadu's state award, for her contributions to the film industry.

==Early life==
{{BLP unsourced section |date= March 2016}}
She was born in Chennai into a Roman Catholic family to Anthony Devraj and Regina Mary Nirmala. Her ancestors were from Paramakudi near Madurai. Her full name is Lourde-Mary Rajeshwari. The 78 RPM vinyl record containing her songs in her debut film ''Nalla Idathu Sammanthan'' shows her name as D. L. Rajeswari.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spicyonion.com/singer/d-l-rajeswari/ Singer D. L. Rajeswari]&lt;/ref&gt; Since there was already another established singer with the name of [[M. S. Rajeswari]] her name was abbreviated into L.R.Eshwari. She did not have any formal training in singing. Her mother was a chorus singer in films. Eshwari used to accompany her mother to the studios and soon began singing in the chorus herself, but quickly got a break to lend her voice as lead-singer.&lt;br&gt;
Her first song as a playback singer was ''Inba Naalidhe'' in the film [[Manohara]] as a chorus singer with [[Jikki]]. Music was scored by [[S. V. Venkatraman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamizhstudio.com/Koodu/thodargal_4_24.php |publisher=thamizhstudio.com|title=எஸ்.வி. வெங்கட்ராமன் -12|language=Tamil |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her first break came from Thiru. K.V.Mahadevan in 1958 in the movie ''Nalla Idaththu Sammandham'', her first solo song recorded in this movie was "Ivarey Thaan Avarey". But major recognition came from the song "Vaarai En Thozhi Vaaraayo" from the movie ''Paasa Malar'' (1961) sung under the baton of Viswanathan-Ramamurthy, which composers explored and exploited her vocal abilities to the maximum extent possible over the next 20 years.

==Career==
She sang under the direction of famous composers like [[M.S.Viswanathan]], T.K.Ramamoorthy, [[K. V. Mahadevan]], Veda, V.Kumar, Shankar-Ganesh, [[G. K. Venkatesh]] and [[Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan]]. Her unique voice was considered to be suited for peppy numbers in the movies, be it a dance tune, folk song or a devotional track.  Her song "Vaarayo Thozhi" from ''Paasa Malar'' was a popular choice for wedding music.

She has also recorded many devotional albums in praise of the Goddess Amman which were hugely popular among the Tamil community and were played in many temples. Her "Chellatha" and "Karpoora Nayagi" numbers has won her a lot of fame among devotees. She sang Christmas songs "Varuvai Varuvai" and " Deivam Thantha Divya Kumaaran" composed by Dr Anand Chellappa.

Her Hindi song "Uduthi Hi Chidiya" from the film ''Pistonwali'', music by Satyam shows her ability.
She sang romantic songs filmed on heroines as well as cabarets filmed on dance-artistes and also folk songs.

She made her everlasting impression in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film industry with her husky and peppy numbers. Till date most of her songs are very popular among the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] audience. Her notable hits include "Masaka Masaka Cheekatilo" from ''[[Devudu Chesina Manushulu]]'', "Maayadari Sinnodu" from ''[[Ammamaata]]'', "Bhale Bhale Magadivo" from ''[[Maro Charitra (2010 film)|Marocharitra]]'', "Arey Yemiti Lokam" from ''[[Anthulenikatha]]'', "Le Le Le Naa Raaja" from ''[[Premnagar]]'', "Malle Puvvulu Pillagaalulu" and "Theesko Coco Cola Esko Rammusoda" etc.

She rendered several duets with [[S. Janaki]] in Kannada movies as well.

{{Former administrative units of Pakistan}}
'''Las Bela''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|ریاست لسبیلہ}}}}) was a [[princely state]] in a [[subsidiary alliance]] with [[British India]] (later a [[Princely states of Pakistan|princely state of Pakistan]]) which existed until 1955. The state occupied an area of {{Convert|18254|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in the extreme southeast of the [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] region, with an extensive coastline on the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south. Las Bela was bordered by the princely states of [[Khanate of Kalat|Kalat]] and [[State of Makran|Makran]] to the north and west. To the east lay the province of [[Sind Province (1936–1955)|Sind]] and to the southeast lay the [[Federal Capital Territory (Pakistan)|Federal Capital Territory]] around the city of [[Karachi]].

==History==

The State of Las Bela was founded in 1742 by [[Jam of Lasbela|Jam]] Ali Khan I. His descendants ruled Las Bela until 1955 when the state became part of [[West Pakistan]]. The statement of [[Ghulam Qadir Khan]] the last Jam of Las Bela on signing the accession was:

:We hold historical ties with [[Sindh]] and share strongest cultural bond with the Province. Our People have accepted [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah|Jinnah]] Sahab as the leader of new Muslim homeland and we vote to emerge in Pakistan.
 
For a period of three years between 3 October 1952 and 14 October 1955, Las Bela was part of the [[Baluchistan States Union]] but retained internal autonomy. In 1955, Las Bela was incorporated into the new province of [[West Pakistan]] and became part of [[Kalat District|Kalat division]]. In 1962, the area of Las Bela was detached from Kalat division and merged with the former Federal Capital Territory to form the division of [[Karachi Division|Karachi-Bela]]. When the provincial system was changed in 1970, Las Bela became part of the new province of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]].

==Demographics==
The main ethnic groups in Las Bela are [[Baloch people|Baloch]] and [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]] . The population was mainly [[Muslim]] [[Baloch people|Baloch]] and [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]] but there was a small population of [[Hindu]]s.

==Geography and climate==
Las Bela has a hot, dry tropical desert climate. It is only a few degrees north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]]. The sea breezes though make the weather less extreme than inland Balochistan, where {{convert|50|°C|°F}} in the summer.

==Rulers==
The hereditary rulers of Las Bela were styled as [[Jam of Lasbela|Jam Sahib]]. The [[Samma Dynasty]] took the title of [[Jam of Lasbela|Jam]], the local equivalent of "King" or "Sultan".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5791">[[File:Cheshunt Lock, Lee Navigation.jpg|thumb|Magnet fishing for [[windlass]]es]]
'''Magnet fishing''', also called '''magnetic fishing''', is searching in outdoor waters for [[Ferromagnetism|Ferromagnetic]] objects available to pull with a strong [[neodymium magnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnet Fishing|url=https://www.kjmagnetics.com/blog.asp?p=magnet-fishing|website=K&amp;J Magnetics|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hobby has been adopted by celebrities such as [[James Haskell]], the English rugby player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magnetstore.co.uk/james-haskell-fishing-magnet/|title=Magnet Store Blog|last=|first=|date=2018-02-12|website=Magnet Store|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[hobby]] is a combination of [[environmentalism]] and [[treasure hunting]]. The magnets used are strong enough to remove large [[debris]] such as discarded [[bicycle]]s, guns, safes, bombs, coins and car [[tire]] [[Rim (wheel)|rims]] from [[body of water|bodies of water]], but many who engage in the hobby are hoping to find rare and valuable items as well. 

It is thought magnet fishing was initially started by boaters using magnets to recover fallen keys from the water.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Elliott |first1=Coran |title=Safety warning as rise in magnet fishing hobby sees anglers fish out guns and grenades in UK rivers |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/08/18/safety-warning-rise-magnet-fishing-hobby-sees-anglers-fish-guns/ |accessdate=23 August 2018 |work=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=18 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://i.imgur.com/SskJfIT.png |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today magnet retrieval tools are specially designed to retrieve items that are lost at the bottom of bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Go Fishing With Magnets|url=https://www.apexmagnets.com/news-how-tos/how-to-go-fishing-with-magnets/|website=Apex Magnets|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main types of magnets. These are double sided and single sided magnets.  

People who engage in the hobby may be referred to as "magnetfishers," "magneteers," "MF'ers" or "neodemons," (a play on neodymium). With the hobby still in its infancy none of the names has taken root yet.&lt;ref name="reddit"&gt;{{cite web|title=We're called "magnateers?"|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/magnetfishing/comments/76vu40/were_called_magnateers/|website=[[Reddit]]|publisher=reddit inc|accessdate=20 October 2017|language=English|format=HTML|date=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;



==Magnet fishing and the law==
There have been no major reports of magnetfishers failing to observe [[Land tenure|landowners]], local authority regulations concerning outdoor waters, or seeking permissions where appropriate.&lt;ref name="Magnet-Fishing Ultimate Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Magnet Fishing Illegal?|url=https://www.magnet-fishing.com/|website=Magnet-Fishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However it is illegal, and punishable by a ₤25 fine, to magnetfish, or remove any material from canal or inland navigation under the control of the [[Canal &amp; River Trust]] in [[England]] or [[Wales]], other than the [[Lee Navigation|Lee]] and [[Stort Navigation]], [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]], and [[River Severn#Navigation|River Severn Navigation]].&lt;ref name="Canal"&gt;{{cite web |title=General Canal Bye-laws |url=http://www.britishwaterways.co.uk/media/documents/foi/legal/BW_General_Canal_Bye-laws.pdf |website=British Waterways |publisher=British Waterways Board |accessdate=21 August 2018 |language=English |format=PDF |date=1965 |quote=41. No person unless authorised by the Board in that behalf or otherwise legally entitled so to do shall: (d) Dredge or remove coal or other material from any canal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trust spokesperson Fran Read stated "Magnet fishing can have its dangers, and consequently it is expressly prohibited by the Trust." An example of this being A news report by ITV Central which included a video of a family recording an incident of one of their children pulling a sawn-off shotgun out of Titford Canal in Oldbury, West Midlands, on Sunday 26 August. They later rang the police and the gun was removed and taken for analysis.  &lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt;  The Trust refrains from legal action for first-time offenders.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt;

[[Amateur]] magnetfishers in [[Belgium]] helped the [[police]] by recovering new evidence, specifically [[firearm]]s and [[ammunition]], related to the [[crime]]s of the [[Brabant killers]].&lt;ref name="Bende van Nijvel"&gt;{{cite news|author1=&lt;!-- Not stated --&gt;|title='Magneetvissers' bezorgen dozen met munitie en wapens aan speurders Bende van Nijvel|url=https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20171026_03154116|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=De Standaard|agency=Raad voor de journalistiek|publisher=Nieuwsblad.be|date=26 October 2017|location=Antwerp, Belgium|language=Dutch|format=HTML}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In general, Police urge those that find weapons or similar items to contact them.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="What to do if you find a gun while magnet fishing"&gt;{{cite web |last1=|title=What to do if you find a gun while magnet fishing |url=http://magnetfishingpros.com/find-gun-while-magnet-fishing/ |website=www.magnetfishingpros.com |publisher=|accessdate=26 September 2018|date=2018-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3363">'''Mali Red Cross''', also known as '''CRM''', was founded in 1965 on the basis of the [[Third Geneva Convention|Geneva Conventions of August 1949]] and of the order of 59 PCG 28 March 1959 governing associations and NGOs in the [[Mali|Republic of Mali]]. It is headquartered in [[Bamako]]. The primary goal of the Mali Red Cross is to provide aid to people suffering the combined effects of armed conflict, promote nutrition and health, and provide assistance during food shortages. The [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) recognized the Mali [[Red Cross]] on September 14, 1967 as the 109 national society of the Red Cross and [[Red Crescent Societies]].

==2014 Kidnapping==
On February 8, 2014, five Malian humanitarian workers, four of them whom were Mali Red Cross workers, were reported missing by the IFRC. Reportedly, the humanitarian workers were traveling on a road between the northern towns of [[Kidal]] and [[Gao]] in Northern Mali before their disappearance. The abductions led to a temporary suspension in the movement of Mali Red Cross staff members in the northern region. On February 11, an Islamist militant group, the [[Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa]], or MUJAO, claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of the five Malian workers. On April 17, 2014, a news release by the Bamako-based IFRC reported that the abducted Mali Red Cross workers had been freed during an undisclosed military operation conducted by French military forces. Two of the workers suffered minor injuries. The remaining three went unharmed.

==2014 Ebola response==
The first case of the [[Ebola virus disease]] in Mali was detected in October 2014. In response, the Mali Red Cross in collaboration with the IFRC and other healthcare organizations throughout Mali launched an Ebola operation in order to combat and prevent the possibility of an [[Ebola]] outbreak. With only a total of eight cases that resulted in six deaths, the response was relatively successful. Mali was declared Ebola-free on January 18, 2015.

==Statistics==
In 2014, the Mali Red Cross distributed over 15,000 tons of food, provided access to drinking water for 240,000 people, and secured 4,100 detainee visits.

[[File:West Point, Indiana street.png|250px|thumb|right|A quiet street in a small [[Indiana]] town in October 2010.]]
'''Middle America''' is a [[colloquialism|colloquial term]] for the [[Heartland (United States)|United States heartland]], especially the culturally [[rural area|rural]] and [[suburb|suburban areas]] of the [[United States]]. 

Middle America is generally used as both a geographic and cultural label, suggesting a [[Central United States]] small [[town]] or [[suburb]] where most people are [[middle class]], [[Evangelical Christianity|Evangelical Christian]] or [[Mainline Protestant]] and typically of European descent.&lt;ref name="whites"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.claremont-courier.com/articles/news/t18774-men|title=Author explores white male anger in Middle America|website=Claremont Courier Classifieds|first=Matthew|last=Bramlett|date=4 April 2016|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a geographical label ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}

[[Geography of the United States|Geographically]], the label ''Middle America'' refers to the territory between the [[East Coast of the United States]] (particularly the [[Northeastern United States|northeast]]) and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. The term has been used in some cases to refer to the inland portions of coastal states, especially if they are [[rural]]. Alternately, the term is used to describe the [[central United States]].

==As a cultural label==
Middle America is contrasted with the more culturally [[progressivism|progressive]] [[urban area]]s of the country, particularly, those of the [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coasts]]. The conservative values considered typical of Middle America (often called "[[family values]]" in American politics) are often called "Middle American values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/02/01/do0102.xml |title=Comment: editorials, opinion and columns |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/hardhats/time.middleamericans.html |title=Time: Middle Americans |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |date=1970-01-05 |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of ''Middle America'' may exclude locations such as [[Chicago]] (the third largest city in the [[United States]] and one of the world's [[Global city#Alpha world cities (full service world cities)|alpha cities]]) and very wealthy cities such as [[Aspen, Colorado]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The coastal regions of the [[Southern United States]] are implicitly included.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} 

The plots of such American films as ''[[Sweet Home Alabama (film)| Sweet Home Alabama]]'' and  ''[[The Judge (2014 film)| The Judge]]'' center on the contrast between big city life and that of a typical "Middle America" small town; in both, a protagonist with a successful big city career is drawn back to an old hometown. Similarly, the protagonist of [[John Grisham]]'s novel ''[[The Associate (novel)| The Associate]]'' leaves a well-paid job at a giant Wall Street law firm and goes to work with his lawyer father in his hometown, [[York, Pennsylvania]]. The contrast between "Middle America" and big city America is evident in the life of the fictional superhero [[Superman]] - growing up as [[Superboy]] in the archetypal [[Smallville (comics)| Smallville]] and as an adult moving to the equally archetypal [[Metropolis (comics) |Metropolis]]. The depiction of [[Ron Kovic]]'s childhood in the early parts of ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)| Born on the Fourth of July]]'' also fits the cultural perceptions of "Middle America" (though Kovic's hometown, [[Massapequa]], is physically located in [[Long Island]]). The same applies to the episode of [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' which is set in [[Clayton, Ohio]] &lt;ref&gt;''[[The Fountainhead]], Part III, Ch. 4.''&lt;/ref&gt; and which depicts that town as the archetype of "Middle America", the polar opposite of the cosmopolitan [[New York City]] where most of the novel's plot takes place.

Recently, there has been a diversification in the demographics traditionally attributed to Middle America. Individuals and families of various ethnic backgrounds, including Asians and Hispanics, have started to reside in small towns in various interior states, including, but not limited to, Oklahoma, Kansas, Ohio and Missouri.

==Politics==
The phrase ''Middle American values'' is a political cliché; like ''[[family values]],'' it refers to more [[traditionalist conservatism|traditional]] or [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] politics, although larger cities such as [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and major university towns such as [[Madison, Wisconsin]]; [[ Champaign, Illinois]]; [[Bloomington, Indiana]]; [[Columbus, Ohio]]; [[Lawrence, Kansas]]; and [[Austin, Texas]], are exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gabriel Winant |url=http://www.salon.com/2010/05/17/barone_peterson_condescending/ |title=Who’s more condescending to Middle America? |publisher=Salon.com |date=2010-05-17 |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whites"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bouie |first=Jamelle |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/whites_prefer_to_live_with_whites_why_integrating_america_s_neighborhoods.html |title=Whites prefer to live with whites: Why integrating America’s neighborhoods and cities is harder than we think |publisher=Slate.com |date=2015-05-15 |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mixed economy''' is variously defined as an [[economic system]] blending elements of [[Market economy |market economies]] with elements of [[planned economies]], [[free market]]s with [[state interventionism]], or [[private enterprise]] with [[public enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

In a mixed economy, both market forces and government decisions determine which goods and services are produced and how they are distributed."&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single definition of a mixed economy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;oi=defmore&amp;q=define:mixed+economy A variety  of definitions for mixed economy.]&lt;/ref&gt; but rather two major definitions recognized{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} for a "mixed economy". The first of these definitions refers to a mixture of markets with state interventionism, referring to [[capitalist]] [[market economies]] with strong [[Regulation|regulatory]] oversight, interventionist policies and governmental provision of [[public service]]s. The second definition is apolitical in nature and strictly refers to an economy containing a mixture of private enterprise with public enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown |first= Douglas | title= Towards a Radical Democracy (Routledge Revivals): The Political Economy of the Budapest School | publisher= Routledge|date= November 11, 2011 |isbn= 978-0415608794 |pages = 10–11 |quote= The apolitical definition of 'mixed economy' generally refers to the mix of public and private ownership forms...Here 'mixed economy' itself does not specify a political form. it means an economy characterized by a combination of public and private ownership as well as planning and markets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, and particularly with reference to Western economies, the term "mixed economy" refers to a capitalist economy characterized by the predominance of private ownership of the [[means of production]] with profit-seeking enterprise and the [[accumulation of capital]] as its fundamental driving force.{{cn|date=November 2018}} In such a system, markets are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and governments wield indirect [[macroeconomic]] influence through [[Fiscal policy| fiscal]] and [[Monetary policy| monetary policies]] with a view to counteracting capitalism's history of [[Business cycle| boom/bust cycles]], [[unemployment]] and [[Economic inequality |income disparities]]. In this framework, varying degrees of public utilities and essential services operate under public ownership and state activity is often limited to providing public goods and universal civic requirements - such as [[healthcare]], [[physical infrastructure]] and management of [[public lands]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollin, Robert. 2007. '"Resurrection of the Rentier", book review of Andrew Glyn's ''Capitalism Unleashed:Finance, Globalization and Welfare''. ''New Left Review'' 46:July–August.  pp. 141–142. http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/other_publication_types/NLR28008.pdf.  "The underlying premise behind the mixed economy was straightforward. Keynes and like-minded reformers were not willing to give up on capitalism, and in particular, two of its basic features: that ownership and control of the economy's means of production would remain primarily in the hands of private capitalists; and that most economic activity would be guided by ‘market forces’, that is, the dynamic combination of material self-seeking and competition. More specifically, the driving force of the mixed economy, as with free-market capitalism, should continue to be capitalists trying to make as much profit as they can. At the same time, Keynes was clear that in maintaining a profit-driven marketplace, it was also imperative to introduce policy interventions to counteract capitalism’s inherent tendencies—demonstrated to devastating effect during the 1930s calamity—toward financial breakdowns, depressions, and mass unemployment. Keynes's framework also showed how full employment and social welfare interventions could be justified not simply on grounds of social uplift, but could also promote the stability of capitalism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Rees |first= Merlyn |title= [[The Public Sector in the Mixed Economy]] |publisher= Bratsford|date= 1973 |isbn= 978-0713413724 |pages = 240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to [[post-war]] Western and Northern European economic models as championed by [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] and [[Social democracy|social democrats]], the mixed economy is defined{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} as a form of capitalism where most industries are privately owned with only a small number of public utilities and essential services under public ownership. In the [[post-war era]], European social democracy became associated with this economic model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Craig |first= Edward |title= [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Volume 8 | publisher= Routledge|date= June 1998 |isbn= 978-0415187138 |pages = 827|quote= In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it.

or Christian democrats.

The label "mixed economy" can also refer to [[socialist]] economies with a substantial role for non-[[Social ownership|social]] or non-public forms of ownership in the means of production, or to [[Soviet-type economic planning | Soviet-type planned economies]] that have been reformed to allow a greater role for [[market forces]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Etymology==
There is not only one definition of a mixed economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;oi=defmore&amp;q=define:mixed+economy A variety  of definitions for mixed economy.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are generally two major definitions, one being political and the other apolitical.

The political definition of a mixed economy refers to the degree of [[state interventionism]] in a market economy, portraying the state as encroaching onto the market under the assumption that the market is the "natural" mechanism for allocating resources. The political definition is limited to capitalistic economies and precludes an extension to non-capitalist systems, being concerned with [[public policy]] and state influence in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown|first= Douglas |title= Towards a Radical Democracy (Routledge Revivals): The Political Economy of the Budapest School |publisher= Routledge|date=November 11, 2011|isbn= 978-0415608794|pages = 10–11 |quote= There are in general two broad yet distinguishable definitions of 'mixed economy': a political definition and an apolitical definition. The political definition refers to the degree of state intervention in what is basically a market economy. Thus this definition 'portray[s] the phenomenon in terms of state encroaching upon the market and thereby suggest[s] that market is the natural or preferable mechanism...The political definition of 'mixed economy' precludes extending it to non-capitalist systems }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the apolitical definition relates to patterns of ownership and management of economic enterprises in an economy.

The apolitical definition of mixed economy strictly refers to a mix of public and private ownership of enterprises in the economy and is unconcerned with political forms and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown|first= Douglas |title= Towards a Radical Democracy (Routledge Revivals): The Political Economy of the Budapest School |publisher= Routledge|date=November 11, 2011|isbn= 978-0415608794|pages = 10–11 |quote= The apolitical definition of 'mixed economy' generally refers to the mix of public and private ownership forms...Here 'mixed economy' itself does not specify a political form. it means an economy characterized by a combination of public and private ownership as well as planning and markets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The term "mixed economy" arose in the context of political debate in the [[United Kingdom]] in the postwar period, although the set of policies later associated with the term had been advocated from at least the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Reisman, David A. |title=Theories of the Mixed Economy (Theories of the mixed economy) |publisher=Pickering &amp; Chatto Ltd |location= |year= |pages= |isbn=1-85196-214-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the mixed economy, including [[R. H. Tawney]],&lt;ref name="isbn0-04-323014-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tawney, R. H. |title=Equality |publisher=Allen and Unwin |location=London |year=1964 |pages= |isbn=0-04-323014-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Crosland]]&lt;ref name="isbn0-8371-9586-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Crosland, A. |title=The Future of socialism |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-8371-9586-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrew Shonfield]] were mostly associated with the [[British Labour Party]], although similar views were expressed by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] including [[Harold Macmillan]]. Critics of the mixed economy, including [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]], argued that there can be no lasting middle ground between economic planning and a market economy and any move in the direction of socialist planning is an unintentional move toward what Hilaire Bloc called "[[The Servile State|the servile state]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin. ''Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener'' St. Martin's Press (1991), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political philosophy==
In the apolitical sense, the term "mixed economy" is used to describe economic systems which combine various elements of [[Market (economics)|market economies]] and [[planned economy|planned economies]]. As most political-economic [[ideology|ideologies]] are defined in an idealized sense, what is described rarely—if ever—exists in practice. Most would not consider it unreasonable to label an economy that, while not being a perfect representation, very closely resembles an ideal by applying the rubric that denominates that ideal. When a system in question, however, diverges to a significant extent from an idealized [[Model (macroeconomics)|economic model]] or ideology, the task of identifying it can become problematic. Hence, the term "mixed economy" was coined. As it is unlikely that an economy will contain a perfectly even mix, mixed economies are usually noted as being skewed towards either [[private ownership]] or [[public ownership]], toward [[capitalism]] or [[socialism]], or toward a [[market economy]] or [[command economy]] in varying degrees.&lt;ref name=vn&gt;Vuong, Quan-Hoang. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/3639233832 Financial Markets in Vietnam's Transition Economy: Facts, Insights, Implications.] {{ISBN|978-3-639-23383-4}}, [[VDM Verlag]], Feb. 2010, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catholic social teaching ===
Jesuit author [[David Hollenbach]], S.J. has argued that [[Catholic social teaching]] calls for a "new form" of mixed economy. He refers back to [[Pope Pius XI]]'s statement that government "should supply help to the members of the social body, but may never destroy or absorb them".&lt;ref&gt;Pius XI, [http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19310515_quadragesimo-anno.html ''Quadragesimo Anno''], para 79, published 15 May 1931, accessed 12 August 2018; the papal text refers to "every social activity", not only to government.&lt;/ref&gt; Hollenbach writes that a socially just mixed economy involves labour, management and the state working together through a [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]] system that distributes economic power widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=132–133|author1=David Hollenbach, S.J.|chapter=Unemployment and Jobs: A Theological and Ethical Perspective|editor-last=Houck|editor-first=John||editor2-last=Williams|editor2-first=Oliver|title=Catholic social teaching and the United States economy: working papers for a bishops' pastoral|publisher=University Press of America|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, subsequent scholars have noted that conceiving of subsidiarity as a "top-down, government-driven political exercise" requires a selective reading of 1960s encyclicals. A more comprehensive reading of Catholic social teaching suggests a conceptualization of subsidiarity as a "bottom-up concept" that is "rooted in recognition of a common humanity, not in the political equivalent of ''noblese oblige''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=454|author1=Denis O'Brien|chapter=Subsidiarity and Solidarity|editor-last=Booth|editor-first=Phillip|||title=Catholic social teaching and the market economy|publisher=The Institute of Economic Affairs|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European social democracy ===
{{Social democracy sidebar}}
In the early [[post-war]] era in Western Europe, social democratic parties rejected the Stalinist political and economic model then current in the Soviet Union, committing themselves either to an alternate path to socialism or to a compromise between capitalism and socialism.{{sfn|Adams|1993|pp=102-103|ps=: "The emergence of social democracy was partly a result of the Cold War. People argued that if the Stalinist Soviet empire, where the state controlled everything, showed socialism in action, then socialism was not worth having. [...] The consensus policies of a mixed and managed economy and the welfare state, developed by the post-war Labour government, seemed in themselves to provide a basis for a viable socialism that would combine prosperity and freedom with social justice and the possibility of a full life for everyone. They could be seen as a compromise between socialism and capitalism."}} In this period, social democrats embraced a mixed economy based on the predominance of private property, with only a minority of essential utilities and public services under public ownership. As a result, social democracy became associated with [[Keynesian economics]], state interventionism and the welfare state, while abandoning the prior goal of replacing the capitalist system (factor markets, [[private property]] and [[wage labour]]){{sfn|Weisskopf|1992|p=10|ps=: "Thus social democrats do not try to do away with either the market or private property ownership; instead, they attempt to create conditions in which the operation of a capitalist market economy will lead to more egalitarian outcomes and encourage more democratic and more solidaristic practices than would a more conventional capitalist system."}} with a qualitatively different socialist [[economic system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=827}}: "In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership."&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jones|2001|p=1410|ps=: "In addition, particularly since World War II, distinctions have sometimes been made between social democrats and socialists on the basis that the former have accepted the permanence of the mixed economy and have abandoned the idea of replacing the capitalist system with a qualitatively different socialist society."}}{{sfn|Heywood|2012|pp=125–128|ps=: "As an ideological stance, social democracy took shape around the mid-twentieth century, resulting from the tendency among western socialist parties not only to adopt parliamentary strategies, but also to revise their socialist goals. In particular, they abandoned the goal of abolishing capitalism and sought instead to reform or ‘humanize’ it. Social democracy therefore came to stand for a broad balance between the market economy, on the one hand, and state intervention, on the other."}}

=== Fascism ===
Although [[fascism]] is primarily a political ideology that stresses the importance of cultural and social issues over economics, fascism is generally supportive of a broadly capitalistic mixed economy. Fascism supports a state interventionism into markets and private enterprise, alongside a [[corporatist]] framework referred to as the "[[third position]]" that ostensibly aims to be a middle-ground between socialism and capitalism by mediating labour and business disputes to promote national unity. 20th century fascist regimes in Italy and Germany adopted large public works programs to stimulate their economies, state interventionism in largely private-sector dominated economies to promote re-armament and national interests. Scholars have drawn parallels between the American [[New Deal]] and public works programs promoted by fascism, arguing that fascism similarly arose in response to the threat of socialist revolution and similarly aimed to "save capitalism" and private property.&lt;ref&gt;''The Political Economy of Fascism'', by Gupta, Dipankar. 1977. Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 12, No. 25 (Jun. 18, 1977), pp. 987-992 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialism ===
"Mixed economies" as a mixture of socially-owned and private enterprise have been predicted and advocated by various socialists as a necessary transitional form between capitalism and socialism. Additionally, a number of proposals for socialist systems call for a mixture of different forms of enterprise ownership including a role for private enterprise. For example, [[Alexander Nove]]'s conception of "feasible socialism" outlines an economic system based on a combination of state-enterprises for large industries, worker and consumer cooperatives, private enterprises for small-scale operations and individually owned enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Feasible Socialism: Market or Plan – Or Both: http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Ratner/Feassoc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The social democratic theorist [[Eduard Bernstein]] advocated a form of mixed economy, believing that a mixed system of [[Public enterprise|public]], [[cooperative]] and [[private enterprise]] would be necessary for a long period of time before capitalism would evolve of its own accord into socialism.&lt;ref name="Steger, Manfred B. 1997. pg. 146"&gt;Steger, Manfred B.  ''The Quest for Evolutionary Socialism: Eduard Bernstein And Social Democracy''. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Cambridge University Press, 1997. pg. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[People's Republic of China]] adopted a [[socialist market economy]], which represents an early stage of socialist development according to the [[Communist Party of China]]. The Communist Party takes the [[Marxism|Marxist]] position that an economic system containing diverse forms of ownership—but with the public sector playing a decisive role—is a necessary characteristic of an economy in the preliminary stage of developing socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.mofcom.gov.cn/article/topic/bizchina/economicsystem/200406/20040600239133.shtml|title=Socialist Market Economic System |last= |first= |publisher=Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China |date=June 25, 2004 |website= |access-date=February 8, 2018|quote= The development of the economic system with public ownership playing a dominant role and diverse forms of ownership developing side by side is a basic characteristic of the socialist economic system at the preliminary stage. This is decided by the quality of socialism and the national situation in preliminary stage: first, China, as a socialist country, should persist in public ownership as the base of the socialist economy; second, China, as in its preliminary stage, should develop diverse forms of ownership on condition that the public ownership plays a dominant role }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] describes its economy as a "[[socialist-oriented market economy]]" that consists of a mixture of public, private and cooperative enterprise—a mixed economy that is oriented toward the long-term development of a socialist economy.

== Typology ==
=== Mix of free markets and state intervention ===
This meaning of a mixed economy refers to a combination of market forces with state intervention in the form of regulations, macroeconomic policies and social welfare interventions aimed at improving market outcomes. As such, this type of mixed economy falls under the framework of a capitalistic market economy, with macroeconomic interventions aimed at promoting the stability of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Pollin, Robert. 2007. '"Resurrection of the Rentier", book review of Andrew Glyn's ''Capitalism Unleashed:Finance, Globalization and Welfare''. ''New Left Review'' 46:July–August.  pp. 141–142. http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/other_publication_types/NLR28008.pdf.  "The underlying premise behind the mixed economy was straightforward. Keynes and like-minded reformers were not willing to give up on capitalism, and n particular, two of its basic features: that ownership and control of the economy’s means of production would remain primarily in the hands of private capitalists; and that most economic activity would be guided by ‘market forces’, that is, the dynamic combination of material self-seeking and competition. More specifically, the driving force of the mixed economy, as with free-market capitalism, should continue to be capitalists trying to make as much profit as they can. At the same time, Keynes was clear that in maintaining a profit-driven marketplace, it was also imperative to introduce policy interventions to counteract capitalism’s inherent tendencies—demonstrated to devastating effect during the 1930s calamity—toward financial breakdowns, depressions, and mass unemployment. Keynes’s framework also showed how full employment and social welfare interventions could be justified not simply on grounds of social uplift, but could also promote the stability of capitalism."&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of common government activity in this form of mixed economy include [[environmental protection]], maintenance of [[employment standards]], a standardized [[welfare]] system and [[competition law|maintenance of competition]].

Most contemporary market-oriented economies fall under this category, including the [[economy of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.usembassy.de/economy-conditions.htm U.S. Economy - Basic Conditions &amp; Resources].

The German [[social market economy]] is the economic policy of modern Germany that steers a middle path between the goals of social democracy and capitalism within the framework of a private market economy and aims at maintaining a balance between a high rate of economic growth, low inflation, low levels of unemployment, good working conditions, public welfare and public services by using state intervention. Under its influence, Germany emerged from desolation and defeat to become an industrial giant within the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

The [[American School (economics)|American School]] (also known as the National System) is the economic philosophy that dominated United States national policies from the time of the [[American Civil War]] until the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1061.html "The Progressive Movement"].

Retrieved February 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of three core policy initiatives: protecting industry through high tariffs (1861–1932; changing to subsidies and reciprocity from 1932–1970s), government investment in infrastructure through [[internal improvements]] and a national [[bank]] to promote the growth of productive enterprises. During this period, the United States grew into the largest economy in the world, surpassing the United Kingdom (though not the [[British Empire]]) by 1880.&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of Modern British Politics'', [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Political Economy, Robert O'Brien and Marc Williams&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Gill: "By 1880 the United States of America had overtaken and surpassed the UK as industrial leader of the world.: (from ''Trade Wars Against America: A History of United States Trade and Monetary Policy'' Chapter 6 titled "America becomes Number 1" pg. 39–49 – published 1990 by Praeger Publishers in the USA – {{ISBN|0-275-93316-4}})

=== Mix of private and public enterprise ===
This type of mixed economy specifically refers to a mixture of private and public ownership of industry and the means of production. As such, it is sometimes described as a "middle path" or transitional state between capitalism and socialism, but it can also refer to a mixture of [[state capitalism]] with private capitalism.

Examples include the economies of [[Economy of Singapore|Singapore]], [[Economy of Norway|Norway]], [[Economy of Vietnam|Vietnam]] and [[Socialist market economy|China]]—all of which feature large state-owned enterprise sectors operating alongside large private sectors. The French economy featured a large state sector from 1945 until 1986, mixing a substantial amount of state-owned enterprises and nationalized firms with private enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rosser|first= Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr.|title= Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy|publisher= MIT Press |date=|isbn= 978-0262182348|page = 187|quote=After World War II a wave of nationalizations occurred, affecting the Bank of France, the four largest commercial banks, the four leading groups of insurance companies, all electric power and gas producers, the coal mining industry, Air France, and the Renault automobile company (the last specifically because of wartime collabouration with the Nazis by its owner). Until 1981 no other firms  were nationalized, although occasionally new public enterprises were created from scratch or the government bought part of ownership, as it did with Dassault Aircraft in 1978. Until 1986 none of these industries were denationalized.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Chinese economic reforms initiated in 1978, the Chinese economy has reformed its state-owned enterprises and allowed greater scope for private enterprise to operate alongside the state and collective sectors. In the 1990s, the central government concentrated its ownership in strategic sectors of the economy, but local and provincial level state-owned enterprises continue to operate in almost every industry including information technology, automobiles, machinery and hospitality. The latest round of state-owned enterprise reform initiated in 2013 stressed increased dividend payouts of state enterprises to the central government and "mixed ownership reform" which includes partial private investment into state-owned firms. As a result, many nominally private-sector firms are actually partially state-owned by various levels of government and state institutional investors; and many state-owned enterprises are partially privately owned resulting in a "mixed ownership" economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2015/02/09/the-long-march-to-the-mixed-economy-in-china/ |title=The long march to the mixed economy in China |last= Fan|first= He|publisher=East Asia Forum |date=January 9, 2015 |website= East Asia Forum |access-date=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mix of markets and economic planning ===
This type of mixed economy refers to a combination of economic planning with market forces for the guiding of production in an economy and may coincide with a mixture of private and public enterprise. It can include capitalist economies with indicative macroeconomic planning policies and socialist planned economies that introduced market forces into their economies, such as in [[Goulash Communism|Hungary]].

[[Dirigisme]] was an economic policy initiated under [[Charles de Gaulle]] in France, designating an economy where the government exerts strong directive influence through [[Indicative planning|indicative economic planning]]. In the period of Dirigisme, the French state used indicative economic planning to supplement market forces for guiding its market economy. It involved state control of industries such as transportation, energy and telecommunication infrastructures as well as various incentives for private corporations to merge or engage in certain projects. Under its influence France experienced what is called "Thirty Glorious Years" of profound economic growth.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;(Gardner)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungary inaugurated the [[New Economic Mechanism]] reforms in 1968 that introduced market processes into its planned economy. Under this system, firms were still publicly-owned but not subject to physical production targets and output quotas specified by a national plan. Firms were attached to state ministries which had the power to merge, dissolve and reorganize them, and which established the firm's operating sector. Enterprises had to acquire their inputs and sell their outputs in markets, eventually eroding away at the Soviet-style planned economy.

==Criticism==

Numerous economists have questioned the validity of the entire concept of a "mixed economy" when understood to be a mixture of socialism and capitalism.

In ''[[Human Action]]'', [[Ludwig von Mises]] argued that there can be no mixture of capitalism and socialism—either market logic or economic planning must dominate an economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mises|first= Ludwig |title= Human Action: A Treastise on Economics|publisher= Liberty Fund|date=|isbn= 978-0865976313|page = 259|quote= There is no mixture of the two systems possible or thinkable; there is no such thing as a mixed economy, a system that would be in part capitalistic and in part socialist.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mises elabourated on this point by contending that even if a market economy contained numerous state-run or nationalized enterprises, this would not make the economy "mixed" because the existence of such organizations does not alter the fundamental characteristics of the market economy. These publicly owned enterprises would still be subject to market sovereignty, would have to acquire [[capital good]]s through markets, strive to maximize profits (or at the least try to minimize costs) and utilize monetary accounting for economic calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mises|first= Ludwig |title= Human Action: A Treastise on Economics|publisher= Liberty Fund|date=|isbn= 978-0865976313|page = 259|quote= The fact that the state or municipalities own and operate some plants does not alter the characteristic features of a market economy. These publicly owned and operated enterprises are subject to the sovereignty of the market. They must fit themselves, as buyers of raw materials, equipment, and labour, and as sellers of goods and services, into the scheme of the market economy. They are subject to the laws of the market and thereby depend on the consumers who may or may not patronize them. They must strive for profits, or at least, to avoid losses.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical Marxism|Classical]] and [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist]] theorists also dispute the viability of a mixed economy as a "middle ground" between socialism and capitalism. Irrespective of enterprise ownership, either the capitalist [[law of value]] and [[accumulation of capital]] drives the economy, or conscious planning and [[Calculation in kind|non-monetary forms of valuation]] ultimately drive the economy. Therefore from the Great Depression onward extant "mixed economies" in the Western world are still functionally capitalist because they operate on the basis of capital accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1969/marx-keynes/ch20.htm |title=The Limits of the Mixed Economy |author=Paul Mattick |date=1969 |publisher=Marxism.org |accessdate=17 January 2014 |quote= To be sure, 'orthodox Marxism' maintains that the mixed economy is still the capitalism of old, just as 'orthodox' bourgeois theory insists that the mixed economy is a camouflaged form of socialism. Generally, however, both the state-capitalist and mixed economies are recognized as economic systems adhering to the principle of progress by way of capital accumulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongo people, despite their diversity, share a common legend wherein they believe that they are the descendants of a single ancestor named Mongo.&lt;ref name="Young2015p248"&gt;{{cite book|author=Crawford Young|title=Politics in Congo: Decolonization and Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0LWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247 |year=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-7857-4|pages=247–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also share similarities in their language and social organization, but also have differences.

==History==
The historic roots of the Mongo people are unclear, but they probably settled along the rainy, hot and humid river valleys of northern and western Congo in early centuries of the 1st millennium.&lt;ref name=johnsonmongo&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Johnson|year= 1996|title= Encyclopedia of World Cultures, Volume 9|publisher= The Gale Group|editor=David Levinson| chapter= Mongo people|oclc= 22492614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farming of staples such as yam and banana was likely established by about 1000 CE.&lt;ref name=johnsonmongo/&gt; The Belgian colonial rule impacted the traditions, culture and religious beliefs of the Mongo people, and they predominantly converted to one of numerous denominations of [[Christianity]] found in Congo.&lt;ref name=johnsonmongo/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lemarchand1964p122"&gt;{{cite book|author=René Lemarchand|title=Political Awakening in the Belgian Congo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFI-Z5YUxigC&amp;pg=PA122 |year=1964|publisher=University of California Press|pages=122–133|id=GGKEY:TQ2J84FWCXN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Islamic missionary activity from northern Africa has been a source of deep resentment for the Christian Mongo people, leading to a history of conflicts between them and some Muslim ethnic groups found in the neighboring northeastern regions of Congo.&lt;ref name="Lemarchand1964p122"/&gt;

According to Alexander Reid, the Mongo people suffered during the active slave capture, trade and export in the 18th and 19th centuries, where "thousands of Mongo people as captured slaves passed through the [[Zanzibar]] route by the Arabs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander James Reid|title=The roots of Lomomba: Mongo Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8xHAQAAIAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Exposition Press, University of California Archives|isbn=978-0-682-49008-5|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A system of enslavement and slave trade led by Arab incursions, state Patrick Harries and David Maxwell, existed and impacted the Mongo people before the colonial period.&lt;ref name= Harries168&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick Harries|author2=David Maxwell|title=The Spiritual in the Secular: Missionaries and Knowledge about Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmpyCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT168|year=2012|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-1-4674-3585-7|pages=168–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of Belgium as a colonial ruler, with its Leupoldian exploitation model, combined with imported diseases such as sleeping sickness and syphilis, decimated the Mongo people over the colonial history.&lt;ref name= Harries168/&gt; The colonial period also brought an ecological and economic change from the introduction of cocoa, coffee, rubber plantations as well as trapping of animals as pets and for zoos.&lt;ref name= Harries168/&gt;

==Society and culture==
Given the equatorial forests they live in, like neighboring ethnic groups, the Mongo people cultivate cassava, yam and banana as staple foods. This is supplemented with wild-plant and edible-insects gathering, seasonal vegetables and beans, fishing, and hunting.&lt;ref name=johnsonmongo/&gt; The society is patrilineal, and traditionally based on a joint family household called ''Etuka'' with twenty to forty members, derived from an ancestor lineage.&lt;ref name=johnsonmongo/&gt; The male elder of the ''Etuka'' is called ''Tata'' (meaning father). A cluster of ''Etuka'' form a village of the Mongo people.&lt;ref name=johnsonmongo/&gt; Disputes and covenants between lineages were typically resolved through goods or inter-marriages. Some sub-ethnic groups found in the southern parts of Congo have had a chief, instead of being a collection of lineages,&lt;ref name=britmongo/&gt; with the chief known as ''Bokulaka''.&lt;ref name=johnsonmongo/&gt;

Traditional religion of the Mongo people is largely one of ancestor worship, belief in nature spirits, fertility rites, with shamanic practices such as magic, sorcery, and witchcraft. Mongo artistic achievements, songs, musical instruments and carvings show richness and high sophistication. Like many ancient cultures, the Mongo people have used the [[oral tradition]] to preserve and transmit knowledge to the next.&lt;ref name=britmongo/&gt; Polygamy has been a part of the Mongo culture into the modern age, though missionaries have attempted to curb this part after their conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref name=johnsonmongo/&gt;

The musician [[Jupiter Bokondji]] is of Mongo descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jupiter-okwess-international.com/Bio |title=Cargo |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220070541/http://jupiter-okwess-international.com/Bio |archivedate=December 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5276">'''Neolocal residence''' is a type of post-marital residence in which a newly married couple resides separately from both the husband's natal [[household]] and the wife's natal household. Neolocal residence forms the basis of most [[developed nations]], especially in the [[Western world|West]], and is also found among some nomadic communities.

Upon [[marriage]], each partner is expected to move out of his or her parents' household and establish a new residence, thus forming  the core of an independent [[nuclear family]]. Neolocal [[residence]] involves the creation of a new household where a child marries or even when he or she reaches adulthood and becomes socially and economically active. Neolocal residence and nuclear family domestic structures are found in societies where geographical mobility is important. In Western societies, they are consistent with the frequent moves that necessary  due to choices and changes within a supply- and demand-regulated labor market. They are also prevalent in hunting and gathering economies, where nomadic movements are intrinsic to the subsistence strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/anthropology/tutor/residence/neoloc.html|title=Neolocal Residence|last=Schwimmer|first=Brian|website=www.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In western countries, Employment in large corporations or  the military often calls for frequent relocations, making it nearly impossible for  extended families to remain together hence creating new generation of families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/marriage/marriage_5.htm|title=Sex and Marriage: Residence Rules|website=anthro.palomar.edu|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
In neolocal residence, newly formed couples form their own separate household units, and create what is considered a nuclear family. This contrasts with other forms of post-marital residence, such as [[patrilocal residence]] and [[matrilocal residence]], in which the couple resides with or near the husband's family (patrilocal residence) or the wife's family (matrilocal residence).

Currently, neolocal residence is more commonly found in the west, and is becoming more common in countries that have experienced economic development, like [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Ni Putes Ni Soumises''' (which roughly translates as ''Neither Whores nor Doormats'') is a [[French feminist]] movement, founded in 2002, which has secured the recognition of the French [[news|press]] and the [[National Assembly of France]]. It is generally dependent on public funding. It is also the name of a book written by [[Fadela Amara]], one of the leaders of the movement, with the help of ''[[Le Monde]]'' journalist Sylvia Zappi.

In 2005 this movement inspired the creation of the similarly named ''Varken Hora eller Kuvad (sv)'' movement in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="vlt3February2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Identitetspolitiken måste bort|url=http://www.vlt.se/kultur/amineh-kakabaveh-identitetspolitiken-maste-bort|accessdate=3 February 2017|publisher=Vestmanlands Läns Tidning|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fadela Amara was appointed as junior minister for urban policy in [[François Fillon]]'s [[François Fillon#Fillon.27s First Government|first government]] in May 2007. She left the government in 2010, and was named France's [[inspector general]] for social affairs in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Fadela Amara nommée inspectrice générale des affaires sociales | newspaper = Le Monde | language = French | date = 2011-01-05 | url = http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2011/01/05/fadela-amara-nommee-inspectrice-generale-des-affaires-sociales_1461414_3224.html | accessdate = 2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NPNS was set up by a group of young French women, including [[Samira Bellil]], in response to the violence being directed at them in the predominantly Muslim immigrant suburbs (''[[banlieues]]'') and [[Public housing in France|public housing]] (''cités'') of cities such as [[Paris]], [[Lyon]] and [[Toulouse]], where organised [[gang-rape]]s are referred to as [[:fr:viol en réunion#Le phénomène dit des « tournantes »|''tournantes'']], or "pass-arounds").&lt;ref name="Ireland 131–141"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ireland|first=Susan|title=Textualizing Trauma in Samira Bellil's Dans l'enfer des tournantes and Fabrice Génestal's La squale|journal=Dalhousie French Studies|date=Winter 2007|volume=81|pages=131–141|jstor=40837893}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hron 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hron|first=Madelaine|title=Translating Pain: Immigrant Suffering in Literature and Culture|year=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-9324-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pqVDa-3RIqEC&amp;pg=PT197&amp;dq=Samira+Bellil+Dans+l%27enfer+des+tournantes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xPQOUYOUL6yMyAHYkoG4Bg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals ==
Ni Putes Ni Soumises fights against violence targeting women, including [[domestic violence]] and [[gang rape]], as well as social pressures.

The movement's platform for victims of domestic violence helps women and their children escape dangerous situations and supports them in the rebuilding of their lives after the fact. Its support team is made up of lawyers, psychologists, an educational specialist and a legal counsel.

Ni Putes Ni Soumises also supports the [[White Ribbon Campaign]], which runs from 25 November to 6 December every year, and uses this as an opportunity to promote 3919, the national domestic violence helpline.
[[File:Ni Putes Ni Soumises White Ribbon Campaign poster.jpg|thumb|Ni Putes Ni Soumises White Ribbon Campaign poster]]
[[File:Ni Putes Ni Soumises cover.jpg|thumb|The book cover of ''Ni Putes Ni Soumises''.]]

Ni Putes Ni Soumises also carries out awareness-raising seminars in schools in order to encourage students to think about gender equality and break the cycle of sexism. In this way, the movement was able to reach out to 950 students in 2016.

The slogan used by the movement is meant both to shock and mobilise. Members particularly protest against changes of attitudes toward women, claiming there is an increased influence of [[Islamic extremism]] in those French suburbs with large immigrant populations. A particular concern is the treatment of [[Islam in France|Muslim]] [[women in Islam|women]]. Members claim that they may be pressured into wearing [[Veil#In Islam|veils]], leaving school, and marrying early.&lt;ref name="LFC" /&gt; However, the movement represents women of all faiths and ethnic origins, all of whom may find themselves trapped by poverty and the [[ghetto]]isation of the ''cités''. 

A translation of the key points of NPNS's national appeal on its official website:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niputesnisoumises.com/ Ni Putes Ni Soumises - Le Site Officiel -]&lt;/ref&gt;
*No more moralising: our condition has worsened. The media and politics have done nothing, or very little, for us.
*No more wretchedness. We are fed up with people speaking for us, with being treated with contempt.
*No more justifications of our oppression in the name of the right to be different and of respect toward those who force us to bow our heads.
*No more silence in public debates about violence, poverty and discrimination.

==Early history==

=== Samira Bellil and Sohanne Benziane ===
Two high-profile cases gave a particular impetus to NPNS during 2003. The first was that of [[Samira Bellil]], who published a book called ''[[Dans l'enfer des tournantes]]'' ("In Gang Rape Hell").&lt;ref name="Ireland 131–141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hron 2010"/&gt; In the culture of the [[banlieue]]s, organised gang-rapes are referred to as [[:fr:viol en réunion#Le phénomène dit des « tournantes »|''tournantes'']], or "pass-arounds").&lt;ref name="Ireland 131–141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hron 2010"/&gt;

In her book, Bellil recounts her life as a girl under ''la loi des cités'' (the law of the ghetto) where she was gang [[rape]]d on more than one occasion, the first time at age 13, afraid to speak out, and ultimately seen only as a sexual object, alienated and shunned by her family and some of her friends.&lt;ref name="Ireland 131–141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hron 2010"/&gt;

The second case was that of 17-year-old [[Sohanne Benziane]], who was burned alive by an alleged small-time gang leader.

=== Protest marches ===
In the wake of these events, members of ''Ni Putes Ni Soumises'' staged a march through France, which started in February 2003 and passed through over 20 cities before culminating in a 30,000-strong demonstration in Paris on 8 March 2003. The march was officially called ''la Marche des femmes des quartiers contre les ghettos et pour l'égalité'' (The March of Women from the [[Public housing in France|public housing]] against [[ghetto]]es and for equality).

Representatives of Ni Putes Ni Soumises were received by French Prime Minister [[Jean Pierre Raffarin]]. Their message was also incorporated into the official celebrations of [[Bastille Day]] 2003 in Paris, when 14 giant posters each of a modern woman dressed as [[Marianne]], the symbol of the French Republic, were hung on the columns of the [[Palais Bourbon]], the home of the [[French National Assembly|Assemblée nationale]] (the lower house of the French parliament).

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Mariannes d'aujourd'hui Paris 2003.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Assemblée nationale decorated with all the Mariannes d'aujourd'hui]] --&gt;

The following five propositions were accepted by the French government:
#The publication of an educational guide dealing with respect, to be distributed in the housing projects and schools.
#The establishment of [[safe house]]s away from the [[Public housing in France|housing projects]] for girls and women in immediate distress, where they can be safe in relative anonymity.
#The creation of six pilot sites where women will be able to have their voices heard.
#The organisation of training seminars for women to develop their particular strengths.
#Special provisions made in police stations for girls and women who have been the victims of violence.

=== Maison de la Mixité ===
The inauguration of the Maison de la Mixitié, the movement's premises in Paris' [[20th arrondissement of Paris|20th arrondissement]], took place in 2006. Then-President [[Jacques Chirac]] and then-future-President [[François Hollande]] both attended the event.

== Recent history ==
In November 2016 Ni Putes Ni Soumises elected a new leadership team, with Stéphanie Rameau, a long-serving member and activist in the movement, voted president.

In May 2017 Ni Putes Ni Soumises moved into its new premises at 80 rue de Paris in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]], a largely working-class suburb of Paris.

== Criticisms ==
{{Further information|Feminism in France}}
''Ni Putes Ni Soumises'' has been criticized by various [[Feminism in France|French feminists]] and [[left-wing]] authors (Sylvie Tissot,&lt;ref name=Tissot&gt;Sylvie Tissot, [http://www.gisti.org/spip.php?article1072 Bilan d’un féminisme d’État], in ''Plein Droit'' n°75, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Elsa Dorlin,&lt;ref name=Dorlin&gt;Elsa Dorlin (professor of philosophy at the [[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]], member of [[NextGenderation]]), [http://www.lautrecampagne.org/article.php?id=132 « Pas en notre nom ! » - Contre la récupération raciste du féminisme par la droite française] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117081319/http://www.lautrecampagne.org/article.php?id=132 |date=17 January 2008 }} (Not in our names! Against the Racist Recuperation of Feminism by the French Right), ''L'Autre Campagne'' {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Étienne Balibar]],&lt;ref name=Balibar&gt;[[Étienne Balibar]], [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-8675.2007.00422.x?cookieSet=1 Uprising in the "banlieues"], Conference at the University of Chicago, 10 May 2006 {{en icon}} (published in French in ''Lignes'', November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Houria Bouteldja,&lt;ref name=Bouteldja&gt;Houria Bouteldja, [http://lmsi.net/spip.php?article320 De la cérémonie du dévoilement à Alger (1958) à Ni Putes Ni Soumises: l’instrumentalisation coloniale et néo-coloniale de la cause des femmes., Ni putes ni soumises, un appareil idéologique d’État], June 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.), who claimed that it overshadowed the work of other feminist NGOs and that it supported an [[Islamophobia|Islamophobic]] instrumentalization of feminism by the French Right.

Houria Bouteldja qualified ''Ni Putes ni Soumises'' as an [[Ideological State Apparatus]] (AIE).&lt;ref name=Bouteldja/&gt; The debate among the [[French Left]] concerning the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|2004 law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]], mainly targeted against the ''[[Hijab]]'', is to be seen under this light.&lt;ref name=Tissot/&gt; They underline that, first, sexism is not specific to immigrant populations, French culture itself not being devoid of sexism, and second, that the focus on mediatic and violent acts passes under silence the [[precarization]] of women.&lt;ref name=Tissot/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dorlin/&gt;

Sylvie Tissot writes that Amara collaborated with the ''[[Cercle de l'Oratoire]]'', and Mohammed Abdi, the current president of the NGO, is a member of this think-tank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recherches-sur-le-terrorisme.com/Documentsterrorisme/fadela-amara-biographie.html Qui est Fadela Amara?] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ni Putes ni Soumises" is also criticized for its SWERF policy (Sex Worker Exclusionary Radical Feminism) that leads to a lack of inclusion of sex workers and, since May 2017, for its anti-afrofeminism tweets when condemning the NYANSAPO festival, which provides safe spaces and political organization for black women.

The '''nurturant parent model''' also "Nurturing Parent" is a metaphor, for a belief system, which is built upon an underlying value system.  In this Nurturant Parenting contrasts with Stern Father parenting (Strict Father) as two distinct metaphors each used as icons of contrasting value and political systems, i.e. Regressive (Strict Father) and Nurturing Parent as Progressive .  

The Nurturant Parent metaphor draws on [[Parenting styles|parenting style]].  The ideal, effective Nurturing Parent gives his children both "roots in the ground and wings to fly." He or she does this by imparting, conveying, role-modeling and enforcing boundaries which encourage the child towards personal freedom (try out your new wings).  The Nurturant Parent model has a healthy respect for children's inherent intelligence.  As safe and appropriate, they can and should be allowed to explore their environment. Parents are responsible for protecting their child from serious mistakes, by offering guidance. A child will be picked up if the child cries because the parent wants the child to feel safe and supported. If a child grows up believing its needs are likely to be met, it will be more confident when facing challenges.

At the same time or alternately as appropriate, the Nurturant Parent encourages the child to have deep and peaceful roots in the ground thru managed exercise of the child's own self-discipline, self-connection, age-appropriate house chores, limited allowance, discussion of both Feelings and Thoughts and mutually healthy boundaries with strangers, friends and adults generally. 

The above was originally expressed more simply as 'a family model where children are expected to explore their surroundings; at the same time, being protected by their parents.' 

Other ideas:

* True discipline is much more than strict, unquestioning obedience.  Mutual [[respect]] and [[compassion]] are also rights.
* The outside world is no more inherently hostile than it is inherently friendly; stay alert, the world  commands respect
* Mutual respect and compassion is best taught by example.

== Research ==

This model is based on a study conducted by the Boston College Graduate Program in [[Human development (psychology)|Human Development]]{{fact|date=August 2012}} where researchers were investigating the [[Parenting styles|parenting style]] preferred by parents of extraordinarily creative children. Most parenting books recommend the [[Parenting_styles#Authoritative_parenting|authoritative style]].{{fact|date=August 2012}} The researchers discovered another parenting style which they called "the nurturing parent" that focuses on responsibility, [[empathy]], and [[creativity]]. The basic approach these parents used was to:

* Trust in their children's fairness and good judgment
* Respect their children's [[autonomy]], thoughts and feelings
* Support their children's interests and goals
* Enjoy their children's company
* Protect their children from doing injury to self or others, not by establishing rules but by communicating values and discussing their children's behavior with them
* Modeling the [[self-control]], [[Sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] they believe their children will need&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dacey |first=J. S. |last2=Packer |first2=A. J. |year=1992 |title=The Nurturing Parent: How to Raise Creative, Loving, Responsible Children |location=New York |publisher=Fireside, Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-671-77145-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further mentions ==

Herbert Jay Rosenfield ([[Social_work|LCSW]]) in his unfinished book ''Caring Parents: a Guide to Successful Parenting'' encourages use of the acronym "RECEPEE", for "'''R'''easonable '''E'''xpectations, '''C'''learly '''E'''xpressed, '''P'''erformed '''E'''veryday and by '''E'''xample". "The factors that children need to develop good self-esteem...are primarily 'gifts' from us parents!" writes Rosenfield, who offers another acronym "UCARE":

* '''U'''niqueness that is positive, achieved through praise, encouragement, and positive feedback
* '''C'''onnectiveness to family, to extended family, and to a neighborhood that is safe, healthy and moderate
* '''A'''ge-appropriate autonomy: responsibilities and privileges that parallel their age and capabilities
* '''R'''ole '''E'''xamples: parent models with good self-esteem and behavior, whom they can emulate

Reverend George Englehardt stated succinctly, in 1991, that "parental responsibility is to provide their children with a safe, loving, nurturing environment".

The nurturant parent model is also discussed by [[George Lakoff]] in his books, including ''[[Moral Politics]]'' and ''Whose Freedom?'' In these books, the nurturant parent model is contrasted with the [[strict father model]]. Lakoff argues that if the metaphor of nation as family and government as parent is used, then [[progressivism|progressive]] politics correspond to the nurturant parent model. For example, progressives want the government to make sure that the citizens are protected and assisted to achieve their potential. This might take the form of tough environmental regulations or healthcare assistance.

The model is also consistent with [[slow parenting]] in that children are encouraged to explore the world for themselves. They have to learn to face the risks that nature presents. Although slow parenting might go further and reduce the level of protection offered by parents, it would not advocate withholding it entirely.

The '''private security industry''' in [[South Africa]] is an industry providing guarding, monitoring, armed reaction, escorting, investigating and other security-related services to private individuals and companies in the country. Over the years there has been tremendous growth in the private security industry, not only in South Africa, but also in the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Recent Growth In The Private Security Industry {{!}} Building Security|url = http://www.buildingsecurity.com/recent-private-security-growth|website = www.buildingsecurity.com|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The private security industry in South Africa is among the largest in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa has world's largest private security industry; needs regulation – Mthethwa|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28306&amp;Itemid=116|publisher=DefenceWeb|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 9,000 registered companies, 450,000 registered active private security guards and a further 1.5 million qualified (but inactive) guards; many times the available personnel than the combined South African police and army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bigger than the army: South Africa's private security forces|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/08/business/south-africa-private-security|publisher=CNN|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that South Africa had 2.57 private security personnel for every police employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Does SA have the largest private security industry in the world?  - Africa Check|url = https://africacheck.org/reports/does-sa-have-the-largest-private-security-industry-in-the-world/|website = Africa Check|accessdate = 2015-12-11|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is attributed by some to the country's relatively [[Crime in South Africa|high levels of crime]] to a lack of public funds from Parliament towards the [[South African Police Service]] (SAPS) or to an increasing trend in many countries towards government outsourcing of certain security functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/07/201177132021332490.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Others have suggested the number of high-wealth individuals in South Africa in comparison with the rest of Africa has led to the growth of the industry. 

== Regulation ==
The private security industry in South Africa is regulated by the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority, based in [[Centurion, Gauteng]]. The authority was established by the Private Security Industry Regulation Act 2001 and commenced operations in 2002. The authority has wide-ranging powers relating to the operation of private security companies in South Africa. Private security companies are required by law to be registered with the authority.

== 2006 private security strikes ==
[[Image:South Africa-2006-Security Guard Strike-001.jpg|thumb|Street violence occurred during the 2006 security strike.]]

In 2006, private security personnel went on [[Strike action|strike]] across South Africa. The strike lasted 96 days and cost the industry more than a million working days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=http://www.labour.gov.za/downloads/documents/annual-reports/industrial-action-annual-report/2006/Annual Report - Industrial Action Report 2006 - Introduction.pdf|first=Industrial Action – Annual Report 2006|publisher=[[Department of Labour (South Africa)|Department of Labour]]|pages=2|isbn=978-0-9802645-6-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike was supported by the [[South African Transport and Allied Workers Union]] and 15 other trade unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=http://www.labour.gov.za/downloads/documents/annual-reports/industrial-action-annual-report/2006/Annual Report - Industrial Action Report 2006 - Introduction.pdf|first=Industrial Action – Annual Report 2006|publisher=[[Department of Labour (South Africa)|Department of Labour]]|pages=3|isbn=978-0-9802645-6-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The striking workers looted and damaged property, and committed violent crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20060418014035460C703604|title=Shops looted as security strike continues |last=Schroeder |first=Fatima|date=18 April 2006|publisher=[[Cape Times]]|accessdate=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfa.gov.za/docs/2006pq/pqp12.htm|title=Strike Actions of Security Workers – QUESTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA|date=18 May 2006|publisher=[[Department of International Relations and Cooperation (South Africa)|Department of International Relations and Cooperation]]|accessdate=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference criticised the private security industry in a 2012 briefing paper. The paper argued that the prevalence of private security in South Africa "perpetuates fear". The paper also noted that the private security industry "only protects the select	and privileged group that can afford to	pay for security services" and "exacerbates the	divide between the wealthy and the poor".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cplo.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/BP-313-The-Private-Security-Industry-Dec-2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Race Life of the Aryan Peoples''''' is a book written by [[Joseph Pomeroy Widney]], published in New York by [[Funk &amp; Wagnalls]] in 1907, of the history of the [[Aryan race]], a hypothesized [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] commonly described in the late 19th and early 20th century&lt;ref name="Mish, Frederic C. Page 66"&gt;Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief ''Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary'' Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1994--Merriam-Webster Page 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rand McNally’s World Atlas International Edition'' Chicago:1944 Rand McNally Map: "Races of Mankind" Pages 278-279--In the explanatory section below the map, the Aryan race (the word "Aryan" being defined in the description below the map as a synonym for "Indo-Europeans") is described as being one of the ten major racial groupings of mankind.  Each of the ten racial groupings is depicted in a different color on the map and the estimated populations in 1944 of the larger racial groups except the Dravidians are given (the Dravidian population in 1944 would have been about 70,000,000).  The other nine groups are depicted as being the [[Semitic people|Semitic race]] (the Aryans (850,000,000) and the Semites (70,000,000) are described as being the two main branches of the [[Caucasian race]]), the [[Dravidian race]], the [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian race]] (700,000,000), the [[Malayan race]] (Correct population given on page 413--64,000,000 including besides the populations of the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Madagascar also half of the Malay States, Micronesia, and Polynesia), the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|American Indian race]] (10,000,000), the [[Negroid race|Negro race]] (140,000,000), the [[Australoid race|Australian Aborigines]], the [[Australoid race|Papuans]], and the [[Capoid race|Hottentots and Bushmen]].  Those areas inhabited by [[mestizo]]s--Mexico, Central America and northwestern South America--are shown on the map as [[hatching|hatched]] in both the color for Aryans and the color for the American Indian race (population of mestizos in 1944 about 35,000,000).  Those areas inhabited by [[mulatto]]s--Cuba, the Dominican Republic, French Guiana and southeastern Brazil--are shown on the map as hatched in both the color for Aryans and the color for the Negro race.&lt;/ref&gt; as consisting of native ''Indo-European Language-speaking peoples'' of Caucasian ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;Durant Will, ''Our Oriental Heritage'' (Volume I of [[The Story of Civilization]]) New York:1954 Simon and Schuster Page 286&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., those [[ethnic groups]] that are the native speakers of [[Indo-European Languages]] regarded as descended from the original speakers of [[Proto-Indo European]].

At the time the book was published, the Aryan race was generally regarded as one of the three major branches of the [[Caucasian race]], along with the [[Semitic race]] and the [[Hamitic race]].  These sub-categories are now regarded by some as [[scientific racism]].

==Outline of the content of the book==
[[Image:Meyers 1890 ethnographic detail.jpg|thumb|250px|The 4th edition of [[Meyers Konversationslexikon]] ([[German Empire|Leipzig, 1885-1890]]) shows the ''[[Caucasian race]]'' (in pale and in grayish bluish-green) as comprising ''[[Aryan race|Aryans]]'', ''[[Semitic people|Semites]]'' and ''[[Hamitic|Hamites]]''. ''Aryans'' are further subdivided into ''European Aryans'' and ''Indo-Aryans'' (the latter corresponding to the group now designated as the ''[[Aryan]]s'' proper or [[Indo-Iranians]]).]]
In this massive best-selling two volume work, [[Joseph Pomeroy Widney]], the chancellor of the [[University of Southern California]], describes what he believed was the origin of the "Proto-Aryans" in Central Asia about 7000 years ago, and how they spread out and formed the great "Aryan [[empire]]s." He included empires which were predominantly Indo-European language-speaking: The [[Hittite empire]], [[Persian empire]], [[Maurya empire|Mauryan empire]], [[Macedon|Macedonian empire]], [[Roman empire]], [[Gupta empire]], [[Spanish empire]], [[First French Empire|French empire]], and [[British empire]], finally resulting in the colonization of North America by the "Aryans", with the entire process culminating in the ''[[manifest destiny]]'' of the "[[European Americans|Aryan Americans]]" of the United States to establish an [[American imperialism|American Empire]].

== Ethnic groups traditionally regarded as included in the Aryan race ==
[[Image:Human Language Families (wikicolors).png|200 px|thumb|right|The [[Aryan race]] is historically and traditionally defined as that branch of the [[Caucasian race]] that consists of those who are the descendants of the original [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]].&lt;ref&gt;Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief ''Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary'' Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1994—[[Merriam-Webster]] Page 66&lt;/ref&gt; The area primarily inhabited by these people is shown in [[Chartreuse (color)#Chartreuse (web color)|chartreuse green]] on the map above, except for those regions colored chartreuse green on the map that are primarily inhabited by people who are native speakers of [[Indo-European languages]] but who are not Caucasian: areas inhabited primarily by [[mestizo]]s--[[Mexico]], Central America and northwestern/northeastern South America; areas inhabited primarily by those who are of [[Black people|Black African]] ancestry--the [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]] of [[Southern United States|The South]] in the United States, [[Haiti]], the [[Caribbean Islands]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeastern Brazil]], and [[Equatorial Guinea]]; and areas inhabited primarily by [[mulatto]]s--[[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[French Guiana]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rand McNally]]'s World Atlas International Edition'' Chicago:1944 Rand McNally Map: "Races of Mankind" Pages 278-279--In the explanatory section below the map, the Aryan race is shown as one of the ten major races of [[Human|mankind]] (the word “[[Aryan]]” being defined in the description below the map as a [[synonym]] for “[[Indo people|Indo-Europeans]]”).  The area shown on the 1944 map as being inhabited by the Aryan race is coterminous with the area on the map above that is colored [[Chartreuse (color)#Chartreuse (web color)|chartreuse green]], with the exception of the regions noted above in the caption of the Wikipedia map provided on this page for this article.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The book also discusses the "racial characteristics" of the various subgroups of the Aryan race and their constituent ethnic groups.  Widney believed that these characteristics were determined by the [[soil]] and [[climate]] of the original homeland of each subgroup or individual ethnic group.  The original 19th century and early 20th century use of the term ''Aryan'' (the original meaning of the term in English), as noted above, refers to "the early speakers of Proto-Indo European and their descendents".&lt;ref name="Mish, Frederic C. Page 66"/&gt; Today in academic discourse these [[human being]]s would generally be referred to as the ''Indo-European peoples''. These [[ethnic group]]s are indicated below:

The Eastern branch includes the [[Indo-Aryans]] (including the [[Dhivehi people|Maldivians]]) and the [[Iranian peoples]] (including [[Kurds]]); the Western branch includes the [[Armenians]], [[Balt]]s, [[Slav]]s, [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Albanians]], [[Greeks]], [[Latin European peoples|Romanic]]s, [[Germanic languages|Teutonics]], [[Modern Celts|Celts]], [[English American|Anglo-Americans]] (includes the [[European Americans|European-American]]s and the [[English Canadians|Anglo-Canadians]]), [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]], [[White Hispanic|North American White Hispanic]]s, [[White Latin American]]s, [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Australian]]s, [[New Zealand European|Anglo-New Zealander]]s, [[British diaspora in Africa]], and [[Afrikaaners|Boer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Pomeroy Widney|Widney, Joseph P]] ''Race Life of the Aryan Peoples'' New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls. 1907 in Two Volumes: Volume One--''The Old World''  Volume Two--''The New World'' ISBN B000859S6O&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, as of 2011, the total population of the ''Indo-European peoples'' is approximately 2,405,000,000 people, of which over half, about 1,334,000,000, are those belonging to the Eastern branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] peoples, i.e., the ''[[Indo-Iranian peoples]]''; and the rest, about 1,071,000,000, are those belonging to the Western branch of the Indo-European peoples, the ''European peoples''.

==Introduction to the book==

''Every masterful race of the world’s history has its [[Epic poetry|epic]]. It is the tale of the fathers told to the sons. But side by side with the spoken epic is another, unspoken, yet truer and deeper. It is the tale of the race life, not told in words, but lived in deeds done. And the epic lived is always more wonderful than the epic told. The true epic is found, not in the story of the battles or of the deeds of the rulers, but in the race life. In the perspective of time men become less, man grows greater. Race life is broader, deeper, richer than the life of any man, or of any men. The great men of a race are only an evolution of its race force; and the reserve force is greater than its product. They are indices, race marks. The great man is as the mountain peak; for the mountains that loom up above the widespread plain are not the land; they are only the land-marks, marks of the land. Kings are the accident; the people, the law. The [[Greek colonies]], not [[Troy|Ilium]] and Atreides Agamemnon, are the true epic of [[Ancient Greece|Hellas]], vastly more marvelous. So of the Aryan folk; not the [[Vedas]], not the [[Avestas]], not the [[Iliad]], or the [[Nibelungenlied]], or [[Beowulf]], but the marvelous tale of what the Aryan man has lived—how he has subdued the wild and waste lands—how he has made the [[desert]] to blossom as the [[rose]]—how he has built up empire with ax and plow, and has sailed the unknown paths of the [[Ocean|seas]]—these are his true race epic. The others are only as the fairy tales which old wives tell to their children. We read between the lines of the written epic to find the truer and greater epic which lies beyond. This book is an attempt to unfold somewhat of the race epic which the Aryan peoples have lived.'' ---Joseph Pomeroy Widney Los Angeles, January 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Widney, Joseph P.

'''Racial democracy''' ({{lang-pt|Democracia racial}}) is a term used by some to describe [[race relations]] in [[Brazil]].  The term denotes some scholars' belief that Brazil has escaped [[racism]] and [[racial discrimination]]. Those researchers contend that Brazilians do not view each other through the lens of race and do not harbor racial prejudice towards one another. Because of that, while [[social mobility]] of Brazilians may be constrained by many factors, [[gender]] and [[Socioeconomic class|class]] included, racial discrimination is considered irrelevant (within the confines of the concept racial democracy).

==Overview==
Racial democracy was first advanced by Brazilian [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Gilberto Freyre]] in his work ''[[Casa-Grande &amp; Senzala]]'' ({{lang-en|The Masters and the Slaves}}), published in 1933. Although Freyre never uses this term in the book, he did adopt it in later publications, and his theories paved the way for other scholars who would popularize the concept.

Freyre argued that several factors, including close relations between masters and slaves prior to their legal emancipation in 1888 and the supposedly benign character of [[Portuguese imperialism]] prevented the emergence of strict racial categories. Freyre also argued that continued [[miscegenation]] between the three races ([[Amerindians]], the descendants of African slaves, and whites) would lead to a "meta-race", ''i.e.'', a "[[Postracialism|postracial]] race" or a "race beyond race(s)".&lt;ref&gt;Gilberto Freyre. ''The Masters and the Slaves: A Study in the Development of Brazilian Civilization''. Samuel Putnam (trans.). Berkeley: [[University of California Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Freyre's theory became a source of national pride for Brazil, which contrasted itself favorably with the racial divisions and violence then taking place in the [[United States]].  Over time, racial democracy would become widely accepted among Brazilians of all stripes and many foreign academics. [[African American|Black]] researchers in the United States would make unfavorable comparisons between their own country and Brazil during the 1960s.&lt;ref name="hanchard"&gt;Michael Hanchard. ''Orpheus and Power: The Movimento Negro of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, Brazil, 1945-1988''. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]], 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past four decades, beginning around the publication in 1974 of Thomas E. Skidmore's ''Black into White'', a [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] study of Brazilian race relations, scholars have begun to criticize the notion that Brazil is actually a "racial democracy".  Skidmore argues that the predominantly white elite within Brazilian society promoted racial democracy to obscure very real forms of racial oppression.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Skidmore|Thomas E. Skidmore]]. ''Black into White: Race and Nationality in Brazilian Thought''. New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Hanchard, a [[political scientist]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], has argued that the ideology of racial democracy, often promoted by state apparatuses, prevents effective action to combat racial discrimination by leading people to ascribe discrimination to other forms of oppression and allowing government officials charged with preventing racism to deny its existence [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]].&lt;ref name=hanchard/&gt;

[[France Winddance Twine]]'s 1997 ethnography also appears to support those contentions.&lt;ref&gt;[[France Winddance Twine]] Racism in a Racial Democracy: The Maintenance of White Supremacy in Brazil,(1997) Rutgers University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanchard compiles a great deal of research from other scholars demonstrating widespread discrimination in [[employment]], [[education]], and [[electoral politics]].&lt;ref name="hanchard"/&gt; The seemingly paradoxical use of racial democracy to obscure the realities of racism has been referred to by scholar [[Florestan Fernandes]] as the "prejudice of having no prejudices". That is, because the state assumes the absence of racial prejudice, it fails to enforce what few laws exist to counter racial discrimination, as it believes that such efforts are unnecessary. More recently, North American anthropologist John Collins has argued that shifting engagements with collective memory, genealogically-based accounts of ancestry, and even UNESCO World Heritage programs have articulated with efforts by the Black Movement, academics, and progressive government actors to undermine claims about racial democracy in ways that increasingly lead Brazilians to self-identify as Black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revolt of the Saints: Memory and Redemption in the Twilight of Brazilian Racial Democracy|last=Collins|first=John F.|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8223-5320-1|location=Durham, NC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Gilberto Freyre on the criticisms that he received ==

The life of [[Gilberto Freyre]], after he published ''[[Casa-Grande &amp; Senzala]]'', became an eternal source of explanation. He repeated several times that he did not create the myth of a racial democracy and that the fact that his books recognized the intense mixing between "races" in Brazil did not mean a lack of prejudice or discrimination. He pointed out that many people have claimed the [[United States]] to have been an "exemplary democracy" whereas [[slavery]] and [[racial segregation]] were present throughout most of the history of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="imil.org.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.institutomillenium.org.br/artigos/a-importancia-de-gilberto-freyre-para-a-construcao-da-nacao-brasileira-parte-ii/|title=A importância de Gilberto Freyre para a construção da Nação Brasileira - Parte II - Instituto Millenium|date=11 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The interpretation of those who want to place me among the sociologists or anthropologists who said prejudice of race among the Portuguese or the Brazilians never existed is extreme. What I have always suggested is that such prejudice is minimal ... when compared to that which is still in place elsewhere, where laws still regulate relations between Europeans and other groups".

"It is not that racial prejudice or social prejudice related to complexion are absent in Brazil. They exist. But no one here would have thought of "white-only" Churches. No one in Brazil would have thought of laws against interracial marriage ... Fraternal spirit is stronger among Brazilians than racial prejudice, colour, class or religion. It is true that equality has not been reached since the end of slavery ... There was racial prejudice among plantation owners, there was social distance between the masters and the slaves, between whites and blacks ... But few wealthy Brazilians were as concerned with racial purity as the majority were in the [[Old South]]".&lt;ref name="imil.org.br"/&gt;

A '''reunion dinner''' (Chinese: 年夜飯, 团年饭 or 团圆饭; Vietnamese: Tất niên) is held on [[New Year's Eve]] of the [[Chinese Lunar New Year|Chinese]] and [[Vietnamese New Year]]s, during which family members get together to celebrate. It is often considered the most important get-together meal of the entire year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/8Kaleidoscope644.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217203439/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/8Kaleidoscope644.html |archivedate=2015-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical menu==
The New Year's Eve dinner is very large and traditionally includes dumplings, chicken, and pork. Fish (魚, yú) is also included, but intentionally not finished, and the remaining fish is stored overnight. The reason for this stems from a [[pun]], as the Chinese phrase 年年有魚/餘; (nián nián yǒu yú, or "every year there is fish/leftover") is a homophone for phrases which mean "be blessed every year" or "have abundant profit every year". Similarly, a type of black hair-like algae, "[[fat choy]]"(髮菜, fǎ cài, literally "hair vegetable" in Chinese), is also featured in many dishes since its name sounds similar to "prosperity"(發財, fā cái). [[Hakka people|Hakka]] will serve "kiu nyuk" 扣肉 and "ngiong tiu fu" 釀豆腐. The belief is that having one will lead to the other, as the phrases sound similar to one another.

'''Stewart John Greenleaf''' (born October 4, 1939) is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[Pennsylvania State Senate]], representing the [[Pennsylvania Senate, District 12|12th District]] since 1979. His district includes portions of eastern [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] and southern [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]].

==Biography==
Greenleaf is a 1961 graduate of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from the [[University of Toledo|University of Toledo College of Law]].  He served as an assistant district attorney in Montgomery County from 1970 to 1977 and also an assistant public defender in Bucks County.  Greenleaf continues to serve as a partner in his law firm, Elliott Greenleaf, whose attorneys include Montgomery County Commissioner [[Bruce L. Castor, Jr.|Bruce Castor]] and former State Rep. [[Melissa Murphy Weber]].

==Career==
In 1971, Greenleaf was elected as a Commissioner for his hometown of [[Upper Moreland Township, Pennsylvania]].  After one term, Greenleaf was elected to a seat in the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] in 1976.  He served a single term in the house before winning his bid for the State Senate in 1978.  Greenleaf has been re-elected seven times, most recently in 2014.

Greenleaf considered a run for [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congress]] in 1993, briefly forming an exploratory committee to take on [[Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky]].  However, he dropped out before the county endorsement convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Heidorn Jr. |last= Rich|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= ''Margolies-Mezvinsky Ahead in Fund-Raising'' |format= |work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |publisher= |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date= August 28, 1994|accessdate= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, Greenleaf did run for Congress, attempting to defeat first-term Congressman [[Joe Hoeffel]]. By then, he'd represented much of the eastern portion of the congressional district for almost a quarter-century. Ultimately,  Hoeffel won the race with nearly 53% of the vote to Greenleaf's 46%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionreturns.state.pa.us/ElectionsInformation.aspx?FunctionID=13&amp;ElectionID=2&amp;OfficeID=11 Pennsylvania Department of State, Election Returns, 11/7/2000] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130053500/http://www.electionreturns.state.pa.us/ElectionsInformation.aspx?FunctionID=13&amp;ElectionID=2&amp;OfficeID=11 |date=January 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenleaf did not have to give up his state senate seat to run for Congress; Pennsylvania state senators serve staggered four-year terms, and Greenleaf was not up for reelection until 2002.

Senator Greenleaf is Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and serves on the Appropriations, Banking &amp; Insurance, Consumer Protection &amp; Professional Licensure and Environmental Resources &amp; Energy Committees.

'''Superpower collapse''' is the political collapse of a [[superpower]] [[nation state]]; the term is most often used to describe the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] but also can be applied to the loss of the [[British Empire]]'s superpower status.

==Soviet Union==
Dramatic changes occurred in the [[Soviet Union]] during [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|the 1980s and early 1990s]], with ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'', the dramatic [[Berlin Wall#The fall|fall of the Berlin Wall]] in November 1989, and finally ending in the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. As early as 1970, [[Andrei Amalrik]] had made [[Predictions of the dissolution of the Soviet Union|predictions of Soviet collapse]]; [[Emmanuel Todd]] made a similar prediction in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;The final fall, Todd, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{see also|American Century}}
Some political scientists {{who?|date=November 2017}} believe that when one superpower collapses, another must take its place so as to maintain a [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]].  During the [[Cold War]], the U.S. fought many [[proxy war]]s against [[Soviet Union|USSR]]-supported Marxist-Leninist and socialist states, but after the Soviet dissolution found itself as the world's sole superpower, even deemed by a few {{who?|date=November 2017}} to be the world's sole [[hyperpower]]. Political theoreticians of the [[Neorealism (international relations)|neo-realist]] philosophy, (known by many as [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]]s), self-styled as the [[Blue Team (U.S. politics)|Blue Team]], increasingly view the [[China|People's Republic of China]] as a military threat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/06/20/136901727/chinas-growing-military-muscle-a-looming-threat|title=China's Growing Military Muscle: A Looming Threat?|date=20 June 2011|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/06/10/we-face-a-very-serious-chinese-military-threat/|title=‘We Face a Very Serious Chinese Military Threat’|author=Isaac Stone Fish|date=10 June 2013|work=Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are [[China–United States relations|strong economic ties]] between the two powers. Blue Team members favor [[containment]] and confrontation with the PRC, and strong [[Taiwan–United States relations|US support of Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="TIME Magazine"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[After the Empire: The Breakdown of the American Order]] &lt;ref&gt;Todd, publ Constable, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Emmanuel Todd predicts the eventual decline and fall of the United States as a superpower; 'After years of being perceived as a problem-solver, The US itself has now become a problem for the rest of the world.'

==British Empire==
The consequence of fighting two World Wars in a relatively short amount of time, along with the emergence of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] rise to superpower status after the end of [[World War II]], both of which were hostile to British imperialism and along with the change in ideology led to a rapid wave of [[decolonization]] all over the world in the decades after World War II. The [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 is generally considered the beginning of the end of Britain's period as a superpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education1 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Derek | last=Brown | title=1956: Suez and the end of empire | date=14 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/5199392.stm | work=BBC News | first=Paul | last=Reynolds | title=Suez: End of empire | date=24 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History's worst decisions and the people who made them, pp. 167–172&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==

'Dangers are never greater than when empires break up'.  — [[Margaret Thatcher]]&lt;ref&gt;The Downing Street Years, P769&lt;/ref&gt;

'That special time (collapse of communism in Eastern Europe) caught me in its wild vortex and ... compelled me to do what had to be done.' [[Václav Havel]]&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, p364&lt;/ref&gt;

'The world reads an expansion in military activity as a sign of increasing power when in fact it serves to mask a decline.' — [[Emmanuel Todd]]&lt;ref&gt;After the Empire, Constable, 2001, pXVI&lt;/ref&gt;

'The world is a complex whole, subject to endless revolutions (which) show a continual tendency to destruction.' [[Denis Diderot]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Letter on the Blind]], 1749&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Superpower disengagement''' is a [[foreign policy]] option whereby the most powerful nations, the [[superpower]]s, reduce their interventions in an area.  Such disengagement could be multilateral among superpowers or lesser powers, or bilateral between two superpowers, or unilateral.  It could mean an end to either direct or indirect interventions.  For instance, disengagement could mean that the superpowers remove their support of proxies in [[proxy war]]s in order to de-escalate a superpower conflict back to a local problem based on local disputes.  Disengagement can create buffers between superpowers that might prevent conflicts or reduce the intensity of conflicts.

The term usually refers to various policy proposals during the [[Cold War]] which attempted to defuse tensions between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], largely because of the risk of any superpower conflict to escalate to [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].  Examples of one-sided disengagement include when [[Joseph Stalin]] decided to end Soviet support for the communist [[guerrilla]]s in [[Greece]] during the [[Greek Civil War]], and when [[Richard Nixon]] withdrew US troops from Vietnam in the early 1970s.  

The more important candidates for disengagement were where Soviet and US forces faced each other directly such as in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]].  The [[Austrian State Treaty]] is an example of formal, [[multilateralism|multilateral]], superpower disengagement which left Austria as neutral for the duration of the Cold War, with Austria staying out of the [[Warsaw Pact]], [[NATO]], and the [[European Economic Community]].  The 1952 [[Stalin Note]] is perhaps the most controversial proposal of superpower disengagement from Germany.

This [[disability rights]] timeline lists events outside the United States relating to the civil rights of people with disabilities, including court decisions, the passage of legislation, activists' actions, significant abuses of people with disabilities that illustrate their lack of civil rights at the time, and the founding of various organizations. Although the disability rights movement itself began in the 1960s, advocacy for the rights of people with disabilities started much earlier and continues to the present.

==Prior to the 1700s==
* Ancient Greece - A [[Pharmakos|pharmakós]] (Greek: φαρμακός, plural pharmakoi) in Ancient Greek religion was the ritualistic sacrifice or exile of a human scapegoat or victim. A cripple, a slave or a criminal was chosen and expelled from the community at times of disaster (famine, invasion or plague) or at times of calendrical crisis. It was believed that this would bring about purification. On the first day of the [[Thargelia]], a festival of [[Apollo]] at Athens, two men, the ''Pharmakoi'', were led out as if to be sacrificed as an expiation. Some scholia state that ''pharmakoi'' were actually sacrificed (thrown from a cliff or burned), but many modern scholars reject this, arguing that the earliest source for the ''pharmakos'' (the iambic satirist [[Hipponax]]) shows the ''pharmakoi'' being beaten and stoned, but not executed. A more plausible explanation would be that sometimes they were executed and sometimes not, depending on the attitude of the victim. For instance, a deliberate unrepentant murderer would most likely be put to death.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

* 1845 - The [[Lunacy Act 1845]] (8 &amp; 9 Vict., c. 100) and the [[County Asylums Act 1845]] formed [[mental health law]] in [[England and Wales]] from 1845 to 1890. The Lunacy Act's most important provision was a change in the status of [[mental illness|mentally ill]] people to [[patients]]. As well, the Lunacy Act created the [[Commissioners in Lunacy]] or Lunacy Commission, a [[UK]] [[public body]] established to oversee asylums and the welfare of [[mental illness|mentally ill]] people. It succeeded the [[Metropolitan Commissioners in Lunacy]]. The Lunacy Act of 1845 was passed through Parliament simultaneously with the 1845 County Asylums Act. The two acts were dependent on each other. The Lunacy Act established the Lunacy Commission and the County Asylums Act set forth most of the provisions as to what was to be monitored within the asylums and helped establish the public network of the county asylums. Like the Lunacy Act, there had been several drafts of this act passed before 1845 and several afterward as well. The most notable of these were the 1808, and the 1853 County Asylum Acts. The Lunacy Act itself was amended several times after its conception. There was a new version written in both 1846 and 1847. Both of these versions were actually repealed by the 1853 County Asylums Act. The importance of these two acts together is that they consolidated Lunacy Law in England. However, no legislation has ever combined the entirety of Lunacy Law. Both of these acts were the basis for Lunacy Law in England until 1890 when both of them were repealed by the Lunacy Act of 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/5S.htm The Lunacy Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624161914/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/5S.HTM |date=2007-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1913 - The [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913]] was an act of the United Kingdom which made provisions for the institutional treatment of people deemed to be "[[feeble-minded]]" and "moral defectives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studymore.org.uk/mhhglo.htm#MentalDeficiency|title=Mental Health (History) Dictionary|publisher=studymore.org.uk|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It proposed an institutional separation so that mental defectives should be taken out of Poor Law institutions and prisons into newly established colonies."&lt;ref&gt;Anne Digby, "Contexts and perspectives" in{{cite book |title=From Idiocy to Mental Deficiency: Historical Perspectives on People With Learning Disabilities|editors=David Wright, Anne Digby|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=0-203-16224-2}} 1-21&lt;/ref&gt; It was repealed by the [[Mental Health Act 1959]]. The 1913 act created the [[Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency]], which was a [[United Kingdom]] body overseeing the treatment of the mentally ill. The Board was created to replace the [[Commissioners in Lunacy]], under the [[Home Office]] but independent in that it reported to the [[Lord Chancellor]] (who would investigate breaches of care and integrity). It was transferred to the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Health]] by the [[Ministry of Health Act 1919]] and reorganized in 1930. The Board consisted of: a Chairman, two Senior Medical Commissioners, one Senior Legal Commissioner, six Commissioners (lawyers and doctors), six Inspectors and administrative staff. By law, at least one of these had to be a [[woman]]. The Commissioners of the board went round the country seeing that those detained under the various mental and mental deficiency Acts were legally in custody and that care was proper and moneys and other properties owned by patients were not being misused or stolen. The board was based in [[Northumberland Avenue]], [[London]], until 1939 when it was moved to Hobart House, [[Grosvenor Place]]. Its responsibility was limited to [[England and Wales]]. Its functions were transferred to the Minister of Health by the [[National Health Service Act 1946]].
* 1915 - ''[[People v.

* 1928-1972: In 1928, the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]] of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], enacted the [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]]. The Act, drafted to protect the gene pool, allowed for [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] of mentally disabled persons in order to prevent the transmission of undesirable traits to offspring. The [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] was repealed in 1972. In 1995, [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission under the Act in 1959, when she was institutionalized at the Provincial Training School for Mental Defectives.

* 1933 - The [[Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring]] ([[German language|Ger.]] "Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses") or "Sterilisation Law" was a statute in [[Nazi Germany]] enacted on July 14, 1933 (and made active in January 1934)&lt;ref&gt;... made active: [[IBM and the Holocaust]], [[Edwin Black]], 2001 Crown / Random House, p 93&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed the [[compulsory sterilisation]] of any citizen who in the opinion of a "[[Genetic Health Court]]" ([[German language|Gr.]] ''Erbgesundheitsgericht'') suffered from a list of alleged [[genetic disorders]] – many of which were not, in fact, genetic. The elaborate interpretive commentary on the law was written by three dominant figures in the [[racial hygiene]] movement: [[Ernst Rüdin]], [[Arthur Gütt]] and the lawyer [[Falk Ruttke]]. The law itself was based on a 'model' American law developed by [[Harry H. Laughlin]]. There were three amendments by 1935, most making minor adjustments to how the statute operated or clarifying bureaucratic aspects (such as who paid for the operations). The most significant changes allowed the Higher Court to renounce a patient's right to appeal, and to fine physicians who did not report patients who they knew would qualify for sterilisation under the law. Along with the law, [[Adolf Hitler]] personally decriminalised abortion in case of fetuses having racial or hereditary defects for doctors, while the abortion of healthy "pure" German, "Aryan" unborn remained strictly forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Friedlander, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gqLDEKVk2nMC&amp;pg=PR22&amp;dq=Friedlander+and+abortion+nazi&amp;ei=WOT3R4zxPIOOywSH6JW0DQ&amp;sig=nt0z_vPg8PMvE2yKUYaoWHYTx_o#PPA30,M1 The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution]'' (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of Northern Carolina Press, 1995): 30.

* 1934 - 1975: Compulsory sterilisation in Sweden (Swedish: Tvångssterilisering i Sverige) occurred between 1934 and 1975. Originally the aim of the sterilisation policy was to protect society and it targeted the so-called feeble-minded or other individuals who were considered unfit; from the 1950s and onwards the law came to be used mostly in the interest of the individual, for social or medical reasons, under varying degrees of pressure from doctors and social workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Eugenic indication meant sterilisation could be done if a person's offspring would receive undesired genes for insanity, severe illness or physical handicap of other kind. 2. Social indication allowed sterilisation for someone evidently unsuitable to foster a child due to mental illness, being feebleminded or other distortion of the psyche, or having an asocial lifestyle. According to the 2000 governmental report, 21,000 people were estimated to have been [[forcibly sterilised]], and 6,000 were coerced into a 'voluntary' sterilisation while the nature of a further 4,000 cases could not be determined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c4/28/64/212fc81a.pdf Steriliseringsfrågan i Sverige 1935 - 1975] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205055543/http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c4/28/64/212fc81a.pdf |date=2012-02-05 }}, SOU 2000:20, in Swedish with an English summary.&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish state subsequently paid out damages to victims who contacted the authorities and asked for compensation.

==1940s==
* 1940 - The Race Eugenic Protection Law of Japan was submitted from 1934 to 1938 to the Diet.  After four amendments, this draft was promulgated as a {{nihongo|National Eugenic Law|[[:ja:国民優生法]]|Kokumin Yusei Hō}} in 1940 by the [[Fumimaro Konoe|Konoe]] government.&lt;ref&gt;"The Eugenic Protection Law" The 107th law that Japanese Government promulgated in 1940　(国民優生法) 第二条　本法ニ於テ優生手術ト称スルハ生殖ヲ不能ナラシムル手術又ハ処置ニシテ命令ヲ以テ定ムルモノヲ謂フ , http://www.res.otemon.ac.jp/~yamamoto/be/BE_law_04.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This law limited [[compulsory sterilization]] to "inherited mental disease", promoted genetic screening and restricted birth control access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20060312x5.html|title=Times of change - The Japan Times Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Matsubara Yoko, from 1940 to 1945, 454 people were sterilized in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] under this law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tateiwa.kir.jp/1990/971100my.htm 優生問題を考える（四）──国民優生法と優生保護法] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616004333/http://tateiwa.kir.jp/1990/971100my.htm |date=2007-06-16 }} Matsubara Yoko - Research of Eugenics problem (Professor of [[Ritsumeikan University]], researcher of Gender-blind and Eugenics.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1946 - In this year, newly reconstructed German courts tried members of the Hadamar psychiatric hospital staff for the murders of nearly 15,000 German citizens at the facility. Adolf Wahlmann and [[Irmgard Huber]], the chief physician and the head nurse, were convicted.
* 1947 - The School Education Law (Law No. 26) was enacted in Japan, and it provided education for disabled children such as general classes, special classes, non-residential classes, special schools and itinerant teaching, etc.&lt;ref name=DINFJP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/law/japan/30select.html#basic |title=The 30 Selected Japanese Laws Related to Persons with Disabilities |publisher=Dinf.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1947 - The Workmen's Accident Compensation Insurance Law (Law No. 50) was enacted in Japan, and it provided disability pension and disability lump-sum payments, as well as welfare services such as special allowance, medical services, health care, supply of prosthetic appliance, etc.&lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;
* 1947 - The Mail Law (Law No. 165) was enacted in Japan, and it provided that postage for Braille paper and recorded mail for visually impaired persons are free of charge, and parcels for disabled people can be mailed at half the cost. The postage for periodicals published by disabled person groups can be mailed at a small charge.&lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;
* 1948 - In December 1946 an American military tribunal (commonly called the [[Doctors' trial]]) prosecuted 23 German doctors and administrators for their roles in war crimes and [[crimes against humanity]]. These crimes included the systematic killing of those deemed "unworthy of life", including the mentally disabled, the institutionalized mentally ill, and the physically impaired. After 140 days of proceedings, including the testimony of 85 witnesses and the submission of 1,500 documents, in August 1947 the court pronounced 16 of the defendants guilty. Seven were sentenced to death and executed on 2 June 1948.
* 1948 - According to the ''Eugenic Protection Law'' in Japan (1948), sterilization could be enforced on criminals "with genetic predisposition to commit crime", patients with genetic diseases including mild ones such as total color-blindness, [[hemophilia]], [[albinism]] and [[ichthyosis]], and mental affections such as [[schizophrenia]], [[manic-depression]] possibly deemed occurrent in their opposition and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soshiren.org/shiryou/yuseihogohou.html |title=SOSHIREN / 資料・法律−優生保護法 |publisher=Soshiren.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mental sicknesses were added in 1952. The provisions also allowed for the surgical sterilization of women, when the woman, her spouse, or family member within the 4th degree of kinship had a serious [[genetic disorder]], and where pregnancy would endanger the life of the woman. The operation required consent of the woman, her spouse and the approval of the Prefectural Eugenic Protection Council.&lt;ref name="Sugimoto pp.167"&gt;Sugimoto, An Introduction to Japanese Society, pp.167&lt;/ref&gt; The law also allowed for abortion for pregnancies in the cases of [[rape]], leprosy, hereditary-transmitted disease, or if the physician determined that the fetus would not be viable outside of the womb. Again, the consent of the woman and her spouse were necessary. Despite the unambiguous wording of the law, the law was used by local authorities as justification for measures enforcing [[compulsory sterilization|forced sterilization]] and abortions upon people with certain [[genetic disorder]]s, as well as [[leprosy]], as well as an excuse for legalized discrimination against people with physical and mental handicaps.&lt;ref name=formerhansen&gt;{{cite web

* 1949 - The Law for the Welfare of Physically Disabled Persons (Law No. 283) was enacted in Japan, and it provided the issuing of a "physically disabled persons' handbook", various counseling services, a grant of prosthetic appliances such as wheelchairs, canes, hearing aids and artificial limbs, technical aids for daily living such as bathtubs, toilet facility, beds and communication aids (e. g. talking machines and word processors), rehabilitation training, services necessary for participation in society such as sign language interpreter, translation Braille, guide helper and modification of motor vehicles, work opportunities, specialized facilities for nursing care, and living places.&lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;

==1950s==
* 1950 - The Inheritance Tax Law (Law No. 73) was enacted in Japan, and it provided that inheritance tax is reduced in the case of disabled persons' heir. Up to 70 years of age - ¥60,000 per year (¥120,000 for specified disabled persons.)&lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;
* 1950 - The Local Tax Law (Law No. 226) was enacted in Japan, and it provided that Local Resident Tax is reduced (disabled persons with annual incomes of ¥1,250,000 or less get a tax exemption). The Local Resident Tax exemption amounts are as follows: Specified disabled persons - ¥280,000 Other disabled persons - ¥260,000 There are cases of reduction or exemption from automobile taxes, light mobile taxes and automobile purchase taxes.&lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;

* 1950 - The Public Housing Law (Law No. 193) was enacted in Japan, and it provided that when living in public housing, disabled persons are given special consideration. There is a standard of larger living space for families with persons with disabilities. In addition, local public entities give priority in providing to disabled persons public housing and lowering of rent.&lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;
* 1952 - In English law, in ''R v Windle'' [1952] 2 QB 826 evidence proved that although the killer did have a mental illness he knew that he was committing a crime. The trial judge thus refused to let the insanity defense go to the jury and this decision was upheld on appeal.&lt;ref name="lawteacher1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/criminal-law/insanity-cases.php |title=Insanity Cases - Disease of the Mind |publisher=Lawteacher.net |date= |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 1954 - The Employees' Pension Law (Law No. 115) was enacted in Japan, and it provided that: According to the degree of the insured disability, Employee Disability Pension and Disability Allowance (a one time lump sum for minimal disabilities) are paid.&lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;
* 1957 - The Special Measures Act concerning Temporary Taxation (Law No. 26) was enacted in Japan, and it provided that regarding the Income Tax Law of 1965 (see below), those living severely disabled persons may get supplemental allowance. Supplemental allowance - ¥300,000 &lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;
* 1957 - Section 2 of the [[Homicide Act 1957]] of the United Kingdom states:
(1) Where a person kills or is party to a killing of another, he shall not be convicted of murder if he was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning which - 
*(a) arose from a medical condition
*(b) substantially impaired D's ability to do one or more of the things mentioned in subsection (1A), and
*(c) provides an explanation for D's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing.
(1A) Those things are -
*(a) to understand the nature of D's conduct;
*(b) to form a rational judgment;
*(c) to exercise self-control.
(1B) For the purposes of subsection (1)(c), an abnormality of mental functioning provides and explanation of D's conduct if it causes, or is a significant contributory factor in causing, D to carry out that conduct.

The defence has recently been amended by s. 52 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, which came into force on 4 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=s5 Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (Commencement No. 4, Transitional and Saving Provisions) Order 2010|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/816/article/5/made|work=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, ''R v Golds''&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''R v Golds''[2014] EWCA Crim 748&lt;/ref&gt; provides a recent authority from the Court of Appeal Criminal Division on how the courts will interpret the term 'substantial' in regard to the [[Homicide Act 1957]]. At paragraph [55] of Elias LJ's judgment (following the paragraphing from the neutral citation given below) two senses of the word 'substantial' are identified: (i) something substantial is more than something which is merely trivial or minimal owing to the fact that it has "substance", or (ii) something substantial is big or large (e.g. in the sense that a substantial salary is a large one). At paragraph [72] Elias LJ concludes by opining that the court should (i) leave interpretation of the word 'substantial' to the jury, but if asked for further help should (ii) direct them under the second meaning of the term (i.e. substantial meaning big).
* In English law in ''[[R v Kemp]]'' [1957] [[case citation|1 QB 399]], where the defendant's [[arteriosclerosis]] led to him assaulting his wife while unconscious, it was ruled that in the insanity defense, there should be no distinction made between diseases of the mind, and diseases of the body affecting the operation of the mind, and it should be considered irrelevant whether the insanity was curable or not, or permanent or not. The jury returned a verdict of guilty but insane.&lt;ref name="lawteacher1"/&gt; 
* 1959 - The  National Pension Law (Law No. 1412) was enacted in Japan, and it provided that: There is the Basic Disability Pension, which is granted after having joined the insurance program (Case A) or when a certain degree of disability has occurred prior to the age of 20 years (Case B). In the latter case; however, there is an income limitation. 1st grade - ¥981,900 (¥81,825 per month, 1997) 2nd grade - ¥785,490 (¥65,458 per month, 1997) These grades are different from the degrees indicated in the physically disabled person's handbook.&lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;
* 1959 - The [[Mental Health Act 1959]] was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom concerning England and Wales which had, as its main objectives, to abolish the distinction between [[psychiatric hospital]]s and other types of hospitals and to [[Deinstitutionalisation|deinstituitionalise]] mental health patients and see them treated more by community care.&lt;ref&gt;"The Origins of Community Care", BBC News, 13 October 1999, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/229517.stm&lt;/ref&gt; It also defined the term [[mental disorder]] for the first time: "mental illness as distinct from learning disability. The definition was “mental illness; arrest or incomplete development of mind; psychopathic disorder; and any other disorder or disability of mind”.&lt;ref&gt;History of legislation on disability, Rescare, http://rescare.org.uk/history-of-legislation-on-disability/&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, 0.4% of the population of England were housed in asylums, receiving the standard treatments of the time.&lt;ref&gt;A brief history of specialist mental health services, S Lawton-Smith and A McCulloch, Mental Health Foundation, {{cite web |url=http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/content/assets/pdf/publications/starting-today-background-paper-1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404105121/http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/content/assets/pdf/publications/starting-today-background-paper-1.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their treatment was considered by the 1957 Percy Commission and the act resulted from its deliberations. The act was designed to make treatment voluntary and informal, and where compulsory give it a proper legal framework and made as a medical decision, and to move treatment, where possible, away from institutional care to that in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health: Mental Health Act 1959 General Policy, Registered Files (95,200 Series), The National Archives, http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C10978&lt;/ref&gt; The Act repealed the Lunacy and Mental Treatment Acts 1890 to [[Mental Treatment Act 1930|1930]] and the Mental Deficiency Acts [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913|1913]] to 1938.

==1960s==
* 1960 - The Law for Employment Promotion, etc. of the Disabled Persons (Law No. 123) was enacted in Japan, and it provided:
(1) The Quota System: General employers including the government and municipal offices are obligated to employ disabled workers in excess of the quota. The legal quota was: Governmental bodies - 2. 0% (Non-clerical - 1. 9%) Private enterprises - 1. 6% (Specialized juridical person - 1. 9%) The quota was changed in 1998 as follows: Governmental bodies - 2. 1% (Non-clerical - 1. 9%) Private enterprises - 1. 8% (Specialized juridical person - 2. 1%) This ratio does not include mentally ill persons. Employers are obligated to report the number of disabled workers they employ to the head of the Public Employment Security Office annually. This office may announce to the public the names of enterprises who fail to meet the quota and request them to draw up plan for employment of disabled persons to meet the quota. &lt;br /&gt;
(2) The Levy and Grant System: This system works by collecting levy from those enterprises that fail to achieve the quota of disabled workers. The funds created by the levy system are used to encourage employers who employ disabled persons above the quota and to promote disabled workers' employment and improve working conditions. Collection of Levies: ¥50,000 a month per person (with more than 300 full-time employees.) Payment of Adjustment Allowance: ¥25,000 per month per person will be paid to the employers who employ disabled workers more than the legal quota (with more than 300 full-time employees). Payment of Rewards: ¥17,000 per month per person will be paid to the employers who employ disabled workers in excess of the fixed number (with less than 300 full-time employees). Payment of Grants: For establishment of work facilities, special employment management, vocational adjustment, ability development, etc. to promote such employment. &lt;br /&gt;
(3) Public Vocational Training Allowance for disabled persons and a loan system of funds for purchasing of technical aids and equipments.&lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;
* 1960 - The Law for the Welfare of Mentally Retarded Persons (Law No. 37) was enacted in Japan, and it provided specialized counseling provided by Social Welfare Offices and Rehabilitation Consultation Centers, training for independent life, in-house services such as home helper, day care and short stay programs, etc., technical aids for daily living such as electric toothbrush and special type mat, etc., living space such as welfare homes and group homes, etc., and specialized facilities to help daily life such as residential facilities for rehabilitation, nonresidential facilities and so on.&lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;
* 1960 - The Road Traffic Law (Law No. 105) was enacted in Japan, and it provided safe transportation for visually impaired persons. Thus, sighted persons are prohibited to walk with a white or yellow cane, and to walk with a guide dog.&lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;
* 1960 - In [[English Law]] the concept of "[[irresistible impulse]]" was developed in the 1960 case ''R v. Byrne''. The appellant (described as a violent sexual psychopath) strangled then mutilated a young woman; it was alleged that Byrne suffered from violent and perverted sexual desires which he found impossible to control. [[Hubert Parker, Baron Parker of Waddington|Lord Parker C.J.]] broadened the definition of "abnormality of mind" to include those lacking "the ability to exercise will-power to control acts in accordance with [their] rational judgment". "Irresistible impulse" can be pleaded only under the defense of [[diminished responsibility]], not under the defense of insanity. Thus it operates only as a [[partial defence]] to murder,&lt;ref&gt;[[Murder in English law#Partial defences]]&lt;/ref&gt; reducing the charge to manslaughter, and giving the judge discretion as to length of sentence and whether [[committal]] would be more appropriate than incarceration.
* 1962 - 1979: [[Deep sleep therapy]] was practised (in combination with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and other therapies) by [[Harry Bailey]] between 1962 and 1979 in [[Sydney]], at the Chelmsford Private Hospital. As practised by Bailey, deep sleep therapy involved long periods of [[barbiturate]]-induced unconsciousness.

* 1964 - The [[Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964]] was enacted. In English law, if a defendant at the time of trial claims he is insane, this hinges on whether or not he is able to understand the charge, the difference between "guilty" and "not guilty" and is able to instruct his lawyers. If he is unable to do these things, he can be found "[[unfit to plead]]" under Section 4 of the [[Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964]]. In that situation, the judge has wide discretion as to what to do with the defendant, except in cases of murder, where he must be detained in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Herring, Jonathan (2008).

* 1970 - A large criminal trial regarding [[thalidomide]] was held in Germany, charging several Grünenthal officials with negligent homicide and injury. After Grünenthal settled with the victims in April 1970, the trial ended in December 1970 with no finding of guilt; however, as part of the settlement, Grünenthal paid 100 million DM into a special foundation. The German government added 320 million DM. The foundation paid victims a one-time sum of 2,500-25,000 DM (depending on severity of disability) and a monthly stipend of 100-450 DM. The monthly stipends have since been raised substantially and are now paid entirely by the government (as the foundation has run out of money). Grünenthal paid another 50 million Euros into the foundation in 2008.
* 1970 - The Disabled Persons' Fundamental Law (Law No. 84; major revision in 1993) was enacted in Japan. It includes:

Article 7 (Fundamental Policies): The measures regarding the welfare of disabled persons shall be carried out according to their age and to the types and severity of disabilities."

There are other fundamental principles in this law regarding programs for persons with disability covering the State, Metropolitan and prefectural governments, and cities, towns and villages; as well as those regarding medicine, education, employment, pension, housing, public facilities, information, culture, sports, etc. The total number of the Articles of this law is 29.&lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/disability/decade/publications/z15007le/z1500706.htm |title=Social Development in Asia-Pacific &amp;#124; Protection, Empowerment, Equality |publisher=Unescap.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1970 - Disability activist [[Hiroshi Yokota]] (a member of Aoi Shiba no Kai) published the declaration of activity, “We Act Like This,” in their journal Ayumi in 1970. It stated in full (with asterisks before each point replaced by dashes for clarity),

"- We identify ourselves as people with Cerebral Palsy (CP). 
We recognize our position as 'an existence which should not exist,' in the modern society. We believe that this recognition should be the starting point of our whole movement, and we act on this belief.

- We assert ourselves aggressively. 
When we identify ourselves as people with CP, we have a will to protect ourselves. We believe that a strong self-assertion is the only way to achieve self-protection, and we act on this belief.

- We deny love and justice. 
We condemn egoism held by love and justice. We believe that mutual understanding, accompanying the human observation which arises from the denial of love and justice, means the true well-being, and we act on this belief.

- We do not choose the way of problem solving. 
We have learnt from our personal experiences that easy solutions to problems lead to dangerous compromises. We believe that an endless confrontation is the only course of action possible for us, and we act on this belief."&lt;ref name="lifestudies1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifestudies.org/disability01.html |title=[Full Text&amp;#93; Disability Movement and Inner Eugenic Thought: A Philosophical Aspect of Independent Living and Bioethics |publisher=Lifestudies.org |date=2002-02-17 |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration became an epoch making event in the Japanese disability movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophyoflife.org/jpl201502.pdf |title=Feminism, Disability, and Brain Death: Alternative Voices from Japanese Bioethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later a fifth point was added, stating in full, "We deny able-bodied civilization.

We believe that creation of our own culture through our movement and daily life leads to the condemnation of modern civilization, and we act on this belief."&lt;ref name="lifestudies1"/&gt;

* 1983: The [[Mental Health Act 1983]] (c.20) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which applies to people in [[England and Wales]]. It covers the reception, care and treatment of mentally disordered persons, the management of their property and other related matters. In particular, it provides the [[legislation]] by which people diagnosed with a [[mental disorder]] can be detained in hospital or police custody and have their disorder assessed or treated against their wishes, unofficially known as "[[sectioning]]". Its use is reviewed and regulated by the [[Care Quality Commission]]. The Act has been significantly amended by the [[Mental Health Act 2007]]. Notably, the 1983 Act classified psychosurgery as a treatment that could only be carried out with a patient's consent. Under section 57 of the Act, which applies to both detained and informal patients, a panel of three people appointed by the Mental Health Act Commission has to establish that the patient is consenting. Then the psychiatrist on the panel authorises the operation if it is likely to alleviate or prevent deterioration in the patient's condition.&lt;ref&gt;P Fennell 1996 ''Treatment without consent: law, psychiatry and the treatment of mentally disordered people since 1845''.

This was a landmark case which is influential in Canadian legal decisions involving proxy-consented, non-therapeutic medical procedures performed on people of diminished mental capacity. Eve was a 24-year-old woman suffering from "extreme expressive [[aphasia]]" and was at least "mildly to moderately retarded" with learning skills at a limited level.&lt;ref name=EvEve&gt;[E.

* 1991 - ''R v Burgess'' [1991] 2 QB 92 is a decision of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] that found [[sleepwalking]] as insane [[Automatism (law)|automatism]]. In a previous decision, Burgess was found not guilty by reason of insanity because his case fell under the [[M'Naghten Rules]]. Burgess appealed his previous verdict on the grounds he was not guilty due to automatism because he did not have the ''[[mens rea]]'' to make him guilty. However, the court ruled that sleepwalking was considered insane automatism and Burgess' appeal was denied.
* 1992 - The Disability Discrimination Act became law in Australia, and it banned discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, education, access to premises, accommodation, buying or selling land, activities of clubs, sport, administration of Commonwealth laws and programs, provision of goods, and services and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hreoc.gov.au/info_for_employers/law/index.html#disability |title=A guide to Australia's anti-discrimination laws |publisher=Hreoc.gov.au |date=2007-01-24 |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It largely adopts the views in [[Gillick competence|''Gillick v West Norfolk Area Health Authority'']], a decision of the English [[House of Lords]]. It was regarding "Marion", a [[pseudonym]] for the 14-year-old girl at the centre of this case, who suffered from intellectual disabilities, severe deafness, epilepsy and other disorders. Her parents, a married couple from the [[Northern Territory]] sought an order from the [[Family Court of Australia]] authorising them to have Marion undergo a hysterectomy and an oophrectomy (removal of ovaries). The practical effect would be sterilisation and preventing Marion from being able to have children and many of the hormonal effects of adulthood. The [[High Court of Australia]] recognised the right of everyone to bodily integrity under national and international law, and made a distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic surgical procedures as well as the duty of surrogates to act in the best interests of the incompetent patient. In the case, the High Court ruled that while parents may consent to medical treatment for their children, the authority does not extend to treatment not in the child's best interests. Also, the Court held that if medical treatment has sterilisation as its principal objective, parents do not have the authority to consent on behalf of their child.
* 1992 - The Disabled Persons Act, Act Number 5 of 1992 was adopted by Zimbabwe. This Act provides for the welfare and rehabilitation of disabled persons, the appointment and functions of a Director for Disabled Persons' Affairs, and the establishment and functions of a National Disability Board. Discrimination against disabled persons in employment, and denial to disabled persons of access to public premises, services and amenities are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4c45b86b2.pdf |title=file://\\ishe\parlypdf\Sine\title17\chapter1.htm |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1993 - [[Tony Bland]] was a supporter of [[Liverpool F.C.]] injured in the [[Hillsborough disaster]]. He suffered severe brain damage that left him in a [[persistent vegetative state]] as a consequence of which the hospital, with the support of his parents, applied for a court order allowing him to 'die with dignity'. As a result, in 1993 he became the first patient in English legal history to be allowed to die by the courts through the withdrawal of life-prolonging treatment including food and water.
* 1993 - [[Sue Rodriguez]], who lived in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], was diagnosed with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) in early 1991. She fought to have a [[legal]] right to [[assisted suicide]]; under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], assisted suicide is punishable by a maximum sentence of 14 years in [[prison]]. She took her cause to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], but ultimately lost the battle. On September 30, 1993, in what would become a landmark decision, ''[[Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General)]]'', the SCC held 5-4 against her.
* 1993 - The Law for Promoting Businesses that Facilitate the Use of Communications and Broadcast Services by the Physically Disabled Persons (Law No. 54) was enacted in Japan, and it promoted services to make media like telecommunications and broadcast accessible to people with disabilities. For instance, it provided subsidies for the production of superimposed television programs or those with narrations explaining the action.&lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;
* 1993 - [[New Zealand]] passes the Human Rights Act 1993, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of physical, intellectual and psychiatric disabilities, except in cases of insurance policies. HIV status is also included within the legislation. Discrimination is banned within accommodation, employment and goods and service provision. 
* 1994 - The Law for Buildings Accessible to and Usable by the Elderly and Physically Disabled Persons (Law No. 44) was enacted in Japan. It aims to build public buildings which meet the needs of people with disabilities. It is also called the "Heartful Building Law." &lt;ref name=DINFJP /&gt;
* 1994 - 1998: [[Study 329]] was a [[clinical trial]] conducted in North America from 1994 to 1998 to study the efficacy of [[paroxetine]], an [[SSRI]] [[anti-depressant]], in treating 12- to 18-year-olds diagnosed with [[major depressive disorder]]. Led by [[Martin Keller (psychiatrist)|Martin Keller]], then professor of psychiatry at [[Brown University]], and funded by the British pharmaceutical company [[Beecham Group|SmithKline Beecham]]—known since 2000 as [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK)—the study compared paroxetine with [[imipramine]], a [[tricyclic antidepressant]], and [[placebo]] (an inert pill).&lt;ref name=Keller2001&gt;{{wikicite|ref=Keller2001|reference=[[Martin Keller (psychiatrist)|Keller, Martin B.]]; Ryan, Neal D.; Strober, Michael, et al.

Published in July 2001 in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]]'' (''JAACAP''), which listed Keller and 21 other researchers as co-authors, study 329 became controversial when it was discovered that the article had been [[Medical ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by a PR firm hired by SmithKline Beecham; had made inappropriate claims about the drug's efficacy; and had downplayed safety concerns. The controversy led to several lawsuits and strengthened calls for drug companies to disclose all their clinical research data.
* 1995 - In 1995 [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission under the [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] in 1959, when she was institutionalized at the Provincial Training School for Mental Defectives. Since Muir's case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people under the Act. Nearly 850 Albertans who were sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were awarded C$142 million in damages.&lt;ref name="canadian1999"/&gt;

* 1998 - In ''[[R v Bournewood Community and Mental Health NHS Trust]]'' the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] ruled that a man who had been informally admitted to a psychiatric hospital without capable consent had not been unlawfully detained under the common law.  A later [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruling, however, found that the man had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty in the meaning of [[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights]].
* 1999 - The Disability Rights Commission Act 1999 abolished the National Disability Council and replaced it with a [[Disability Rights Commission]]. Like the Council, the Commission covered England, Scotland and Wales. However unlike the Council it also had power to support individuals seeking to enforce their rights (Disability Rights Commission Act 1999 s.7) and powers of investigation (Disability Rights Commission Act 1999 s.3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emplaw.co.uk/lawguide?startpage=data/98nov082.htm |title=Latest British Employment Law News |publisher=emplaw.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1999 - The [[Mental Health (Public Safety and Appeals) (Scotland) Act 1999]] was an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] which was passed by the [[Scottish Parliament|Parliament]] in September 1999 and was designed to close a loophole in the law which led to the release of mentally ill killer, Noel Ruddle, who was released from the state hospital at [[Carstairs Hospital|Carstairs]] after arguing its treatment programmes were no longer of benefit to him. The Act had two main purposes: The first was to add a new criterion to the statutory tests applied by a sheriff or the Scottish Ministers when considering whether to order the discharge of a restricted patient. The sheriff and the Scottish Ministers must now refuse to order a discharge (either conditional or absolute) if satisfied that the patient has a mental disorder, the effect of which is that continuing detention in hospital is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. That is so whether or not the patient is to receive medical treatment for the mental disorder. The second is to introduce a right of appeal against a decision, notification or recommendation of a sheriff in relation to an appeal brought by a restricted patient in terms of Part VI of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. The right of appeal against the sheriff's decision, notification or recommendation is conferred on both the patient and the Scottish Ministers. The appeal is to the [[Court of Session]]. The Act also widens the term '[[mental disorder]]', which appears in earlier legislation, to include a [[personality disorder]].

It concerns the welfare of adults (the [[age of legal capacity]] in Scotland being 16) who are unable to make decisions for themselves because they have a [[mental disorder]] or are not able to communicate. It provides the framework for other people (such as carers) to act on the behalf of people with [[capacity (law)|incapacity]].
* 2001 - In ''[[R. v. Latimer]]'' [2001] 1 S.C.R. 3, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that [[Robert Latimer]]'s crime of murdering his disabled daughter Tracy Latimer could not be justified through the [[defence of necessity]]. Furthermore, the Supreme Court of Canada found that despite the special circumstances of the case, the lengthy prison sentence given to Mr. Latimer was not [[Cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and unusual]], and therefore not a breach of [[Section Twelve of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 12]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2001/2001scc1/2001scc1.html|title= Canadian Legal Information Institute, article title R. v.

Rosie had only survived birth due to a shared common artery that enabled her sister Gracie to oxygenate blood for both twins. If surgically separated, Gracie had a 94% survival rate, but Rosie was guaranteed to die. However, if they were left conjoined, then Gracie's health—which was already rapidly deteriorating—was predicted to fail before they were six months old. Gracie's death would inevitably result in Rosie's. At first instance, Mr Justice Johnson was left to decide the case without any direct precedents to guide him&lt;ref name="hcourt1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/kirbyj/kirbyj_siamesetwins.htm |title=Siamese Twins Case Presents Serious Legal Doubts |publisher=Hcourt.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reasoned by analogy with ''[[Tony Bland|Airedale NHS Trust v Bland]]'' where it was declared acceptable to remove life support. Johnson ruled that separation would not be murder but a case of "passive euthanasia" in which food and hydration would be withdrawn.&lt;ref name="nejm1"&gt;

It largely replaces the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. Two particularly notable features of the 2003 act are as follows: Under section 234 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, psychosurgery can only be carried out on consenting patients if a panel from the Mental Welfare Commission confirms that the patient's consent is valid and that the operation is in their best interests. It may also be carried out on incapable patients, as long as they are not objecting, with Court of Session approval, but since the law came into force, no non-consenting patients have undergone psychosurgery. Secondly, in Scotland the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 gives patients with capacity the right to refuse [[electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]].&lt;ref&gt;The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, Part 16, sections 237–239.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2004 - In the case ''[[HL v United Kingdom|HL v UK (45508/99)]]'' the [[European Court of Human Rights]] found that the informal admission to a [[psychiatric hospital]] of a compliant but incapacitated adult was in contravention of [[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]. The court found that the distinction between actual and potential detention relied upon by the UK [[House of Lords]] in their ruling that HL had not been detained in ''[[R v Bournewood Community and Mental Health NHS Trust]]'' was not of central importance under Article 5.  The European Court also held that the practice of informal admission of compliant but incapacitated adults who were ''de facto'' detained was not 'in accordance with a procedure described by law' and thus was not lawful under the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;HL v. UK (2004) - App no 45508/99; 40 EHRR 761&lt;/ref&gt; The case resulted in major changes to the admission procedures for incapacitated adults to care homes and hospitals in the UK where they are, or may be, deprived of their liberty (see [[Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards]]).
* 2005 - The [[Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005]] is a [[statute]] [[Act of Parliament|enacted]] in 2005 for the purpose of improving [[accessibility]] standards for Ontarians with [[physical disability|physical]] and [[mental disabilities]] to all public establishments by 2025.

* 2005 - [[New Zealand]] established a [[truth and reconciliation commission|reconciliation initiative]] in 2005 to address the ongoing [[damages|compensation]] payouts to ex-patients of state-run mental institutions in the 1970s to 1990s. A number of grievances were heard, including: poor reasons for admissions; unsanitary and overcrowded conditions; lack of communication to patients and family members; physical violence and sexual misconduct and abuse; inadequate mechanisms for dealing with complaints; pressures and difficulties for staff, within an [[authoritarian]] hierarchy based on containment; fear and humiliation in the misuse of [[seclusion]]; over-use and abuse of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]], psychiatric medications, and other treatments as punishments, including [[group therapy]], with continued [[adverse effects]]; lack of support on discharge; interrupted lives and lost potential; and continued stigma, prejudice, and emotional distress and trauma. There were some references to instances of helpful aspects or kindnesses despite the system. Participants were offered counselling to help them deal with their experiences, along with advice on their rights, including access to records and legal redress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of Internal Affairs, New Zealand Government|url=http://www.dia.govt.nz/Agency-Confidential-Forum-for-Former-In-Patients-of-Psychiatric-Hospitals-Index|title=Report of the Confidential Forum for Former In-Patients of Psychiatric Hospitals|date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2006 - The Disability Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 strengthened and extended the coverage of the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]], increasing the scope of legislation to include more people with disabilities, such as people diagnosed with cancer, HIV, and multiple sclerosis (MS), but not yet showing signs of their illness. Also, people with mental ill health no longer had to prove their condition was “clinically well-recognised”. The new laws also provided extra protection for disabled people in other areas such as private clubs and in discriminatory job advertisements, and provided that all trains will have to be fully accessible to the disabled by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/equality/disability/new-disability-discrimination-order.htm |title=Disability Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 &amp;#124; Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister |publisher=Ofmdfmni.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2006 - The [[Equality Act 2006]] was passed in the United Kingdom. The 2006 Act is a precursor to the [[Equality Act 2010]], which combines all of the equality enactments within Great Britain and provides comparable protections across all equality strands. Those explicitly mentioned by the Equality Act 2006 include age; disability; gender; proposed, commenced or completed gender reassignment; race; religion or belief and sexual orientation. The changes it made included creating the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC), merging the [[Commission for Racial Equality]], the [[Equal Opportunities Commission (United Kingdom)|Equal Opportunities Commission]] and the [[Disability Rights Commission]].
* 2006 - [[Piergiorgio Welby]] was an Italian poet, painter and activist whose three-month-long battle to establish his right to die led to a debate about euthanasia in his country. Welby was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy as a teenager in the early 1960s. The disease progressed, and in 1997 he became unable to breathe on his own. He became politically active in the right-to-die movement, and in 2006 he publicly declared his wish to refuse the medical treatment that kept him alive. The case was controversial, with liberal politicians supporting him and conservatives and the Vatican speaking out against his cause. After three months, he was allowed to die, though he was denied a church burial.
* 2006 - The high court in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, in a 2006 ruling, granted an anonymous individual with longstanding psychiatric difficulties the right to end his own life.&lt;ref name=pmid17649899&gt;{{cite journal |author=Appel, JM |title=A Suicide Right for the Mentally Ill?

* 2007 - The [[Mental Health Act 2007]] (c 12) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It amends the [[Mental Health Act 1983]] and the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]]. It applies to people in [[England]] and [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;In [[Scotland]], these matters are covered by the [[Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003]]. In [[Northern Ireland]], by Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986, which has been amended by [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si2004/20041272.htm The Mental Health (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Act was implemented on 3 November 2008.&lt;ref name="dh"&gt;[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/NationalServiceFrameworks/Mentalhealth/DH_089882 Mental Health Act 2007: key documents] from Department of Health website. accessed 14 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It introduces significant changes which include:

1. Introduction of [[Supervised Community Treatment]], including Community Treatment Orders (CTOs). This new power replaces supervised discharge with a power to return the patient to hospital, where the person may be forcibly medicated, if the medication regime is not being complied with in the community. 
2. Redefining professional roles: broadening the range of [[mental health professionals]] who can be responsible for the treatment of patients without their consent.
3. Creating the role of approved clinician, which is a registered healthcare professional (social worker, nurse, psychologist or occupational therapist) approved by the appropriate authority to act for purposes of the Mental Health Act 1983 (as amended).
4. Replacing the role of [[approved social worker]] by the role of [[approved mental health professional]]; the person fulfilling this role need not be a social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalhealthlaw.co.uk/Approved_Mental_Health_Professional_replaces_Approved_Social_Worker|title=Approved Mental Health Professional replaces Approved Social Worker|date=23 December 2008|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
5. [[Nearest relative]]: making it possible for some patients to appoint a [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partner]] as nearest relative.
6. Definition of mental disorder: introduce a new definition of [[mental disorder]] throughout the Act, abolishing previous categories
7. Criteria for [[Involuntary commitment]]: introduce a requirement that someone cannot be detained for treatment unless ''appropriate treatment'' is available and removes the ''treatability'' test.
8. [[Mental Health Review Tribunal]] (MHRT): improve patient safeguards by taking an order-making power which will allow the current time limit to be varied and for automatic referral by hospital managers to the MHRT.
9. Introduction of independent mental health [[advocacy|advocates]] (IMHAs) for 'qualifying patients'.
10. [[Electroconvulsive Therapy]] may not be given to a patient who has capacity to refuse consent to it, and may only be given to an incapacitated patient where it does not conflict with any advance directive, decision of a donee or deputy or decision of the Court of Protection.&lt;ref name="dh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uk-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2007/ukpga_20070012_en.pdf Mental Health Act 2007] Accessed November 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2008 - The whole mental health [[tribunal]] system in England changed in 2008. As a result, in England, the [[Mental Health Review Tribunal]] as a standalone process was technically abolished and became one part of a Health and Social Care Chamber of a newly established national level of hearings called the [[First-tier Tribunal]]. It is now technically known as the First-tier Tribunal (Mental Health), but in practice is often called the Mental Health Tribunal. A new [[Upper Tribunal]] was also created, which hears appeals against decisions by the First-tier. In Wales, the tribunal is still the [http://mentalhealthreviewtribunal.gov.wales/?lang=en Mental Health Review Tribunal for Wales].
* 2008 - 2010: In 2008, the [[Perm Krai]] [[ombudswoman]] Tatyana Margolina reported that 14 women with disabilities were subjected to compulsory medical sterilization in the Ozyorskiy psychoneurological nursing home whose director was Grigory Bannikov.&lt;ref name="Сизова"&gt;{{cite news|last=Сизова|first=Марина|script-title=ru:Пельмешки из психушки|url=http://www.beriki.ru/2011/02/02/pelmeshki-iz-psikhushki|accessdate=25 April 2012|newspaper=Пермские новости|date=2 February 2011|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sterilizations were performed not on the basis of a mandatory court decision appropriate for them, but only on the basis of the application by the guardian Bannikov.&lt;ref name="Богданов"&gt;{{cite news|last=Богданов|first=Владимир|script-title=ru:Непорочное сиротство: Девушек-воспитанниц интерната директор распорядился принудительно стерилизовать|url=http://www.rg.ru/2010/07/20/internat.html|accessdate=25 April 2012|newspaper=[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]] - Федеральный выпуск № 5237 (158)|date=20 July 2010|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2010, however, the court did not find [[corpus delicti]] in the compulsory medical sterilizations performed by his consent.&lt;ref name="Сизова"/&gt;
* 2009 - Until 2009 in England and Wales, the [[Mental Health Act 1983]] allowed the use of [[electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]] on detained patients whether or not they had [[capacity (law)|capacity]] to consent to it. However, following [[Mental Health Act 2007|amendments]] which took effect in 2009, ECT may not generally be given to a patient who has capacity and refuses it, irrespective of his or her detention under the Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/documents/mental_health_act_1983_201107084458_0.pdf The Mental Health Act 1983 (updated version)] Part IV, Section 58.

* 2009 - [[Eluana Englaro]] (25 November 1970 – 9 February 2009) was an Italian woman from [[Lecco]], who entered a [[persistent vegetative state]] on 18 January 1992, following a [[car accident]], and subsequently became the focus of a court battle between supporters and opponents of [[euthanasia]]. Shortly after her accident, medical staff began feeding Englaro with a [[feeding tube]], but her father "fought to have her feeding tube removed, saying it would be a dignified end to his daughter's life. He said that before the crash his daughter visited a friend who was in a coma and told him she didn't want the same thing to happen to her if she were ever in the same state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/09/italy.euthanasia/|title=Comatose woman in euthanasia debate dies |publisher=CNN |date=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities refused his request, but the decision was finally reversed in 2009, after she had spent seventeen years in the persistent vegetative state.

*  The [[Joseph Maraachli case]] refers to an international controversy over the life of Joseph Maraachli, commonly known as Baby Joseph, a Canadian infant who was diagnosed with a rare progressive and incurable [[neurological disorder]] called [[Leigh's disease]]. A hearing before the Consent and Capacity Board of Ontario in regard to him took place in January 2011. On January 22, the Board released its decision, holding that the course of action in the child's "best interests" would be "removal of the [[endotracheal tube]] without replacement, a [[Do not resuscitate|Do Not Resuscitate]] order and [[palliative care]]." The parents were ordered to consent to the removal of the breathing tube. They decided to appeal the Board's decision in the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]]. Still in 2011, an hour after the lawyers delivered their arguments, Justice Helen Rady returned with her decision, upholding the Board's decision as "reasonable" and dismissing the family's appeal. The family was ordered to give consent for the breathing tube's removal by February 21, 2011.&lt;ref name="torontostar1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/942568--london-family-refuses-to-remove-baby-s-breathing-tube |title=Windsor family refuses court order to let baby die |author=Pat Hewitt |date=February 21, 2011 |work= |publisher=''The Toronto Star''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family refused to consent to the breathing tube's removal, and thus it was not removed on February 21.&lt;ref name="torontostar1" /&gt; Joseph's parents fought to have him transferred to the [[United States]], arguing that while Joseph's disease was terminal, a tracheotomy would extend his life and allow him to die at home.

At paragraph [55] of Elias LJ's judgment (following the paragraphing from the neutral citation given below) two senses of the word 'substantial' are identified: (i) something substantial is more than something which is merely trivial or minimal owing to the fact that it has "substance", or (ii) something substantial is big or large (e.g. in the sense that a substantial salary is a large one). At paragraph [72] Elias LJ concludes by opining that the court should (i) leave interpretation of the word 'substantial' to the jury, but if asked for further help should (ii) direct them under the second meaning of the term (i.e. substantial meaning big).

The report references the involuntary sterilization of a number of specific population groups. They include among others, people with disabilities, often perceived as asexual. Women with intellectual disabilities are "often treated as if they have no control, or should have no control, over their sexual and reproductive choices". Other rationales include menstrual management for "women who have or are perceived to have difficulties coping with or managing menses, or whose health conditions (such as epilepsy) or behaviour are negatively affected by menses."

'''Treshchotka''' ({{lang-rus|трещо́тка|p=trʲɪˈɕːɵtkə}}, singular; sometimes referred as '''Treshchotki''', {{lang-rus|трещо́тки|p=trʲɪˈɕːɵtkʲɪ}}, plural) is a [[Ethnic Russian music|Russian folk music]] [[idiophone]] instrument which is used to imitate hand clapping.

==Treshchotka (Clapper)==
Traditional Russian [[idiophone]] [[percussion]] instrument '''Treshchotka''' is a set of small boards on a string that get clapped together as a group
'''Treshchotki''' is commonly used in [[Ethnic Russian music|Russian folk music]].

==Name==
The word is derived from the root ''tresk-'', meaning crackling or rattle. In Russian slang, word '''Treshchotka''' ''({{lang-ru|Трещотка}})'' sometimes used to describe a person who is excessively chatty and loud.

==History==
There are no known documents confirming usage of '''Treshchotka''' in ancient Russia; however in 1992, during an archeological dig the city of [[Novgorod]], two wooden boards were found; which, by the hypothesis of [[Vladimir Ivanovich Povetkin]], were parts of the ancient Novgorod's '''treshchotka''' of the 12th century. 
The first published mention of '''Treshchotka''' was made by [[Kliment Vasilievich Kvitka]]. The  great Russian lexicographer [[Vladimir Dahl]] describes '''treshchotka''' in his "[[Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language]]" as a device made to produce crackling, thundering and racketing sounds. 
At the present time some villages in Russia are still playing and crafting '''treshchotkas'''.

== Construction ==
'''Treshchotka''' is made of a set of 15 to 20 thin oak planks/boards which are about 16 to 18 centimeters (approximately 6-8&amp;nbsp;inches) long; planks are tightly held by a rope that is threaded through the hole on top of each board. To make sure that boards are not pressed against each other a small short piece of wood (2&amp;nbsp;cm [approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;inches]) is inserted between each board.

==Play==
To play '''treshchotka''' one would hold it by the ends with both hands, generally at the chest or head high and alternate the motion between brusque and smooth to produce crackling and clicking sounds. This technique not only attracts listener by its sounds but also adds visual spectacle effect.

==Superstitions==

It is noted that '''treshchotkas''' was used during peasant wedding ceremonies where instrument(s) could have been decorated with ribbons, flowers and sometimes jingle bells. The use of the '''treshchotka''' in the wedding ceremonies allows to theorize that in the past it were performing not only a role of musical instrument but also served some mystical function, perhaps protecting newlyweds from evil spirits.

The '''Waxiang people''' are an [[unrecognized ethnic groups in China|unrecognized ethnic group]] in [[Hunan]], [[China]]. They call themselves '''Huaxiang people''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]::/wa33 ɕioŋ55/) and they speak [[Waxiang Chinese]]. Compared to the [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Miao people|Miao]] and [[Tujia people|Tujia]] people of the region, they are very different in terms of clothing, food, living, farming and other cultural norms.

==Population and distribution==
The Waxiang people are an unrecognized ethnic group in China, with a population of about 400,000. Currently, the views of scholars and the Chinese government are usually that [[Waxiang Chinese]], the main language used by Waxiang people, is in the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] subdivision of the [[Chinese language]].&lt;ref&gt;Reference 《中國語言地圖集》A1“中國語言圖”，A2“中國漢語方言圖”，B8“東南漢語方言圖”，B11“江西省和湖南省的漢語方言” (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt; The Waxiang people are usually situated in the [[Hunan]] province of China.

==Ethnic group designation==
Many of the Waxiang people are designated as [[Miao people|Miao]], while some are designated as [[Tujia people|Tujia]] or [[Han Chinese|Han]]. However, no matter the designated ethnic group, most of them have recognition to the Waxiang ethnic group, and hope to edit the ethnic group category, in addition to establishing a Waxiang autonomous region.

==Notable people==
*[[Song Zuying]]: mother is [[Miao people|Miao]], father is Waxiang.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
The '''women in Nagorno-Karabakh''' are, in general, composed of [[Armenian women]], [[Azerbaijani women|Azerbaijani (Azeri) women]], and other ethnic groupings.  This “blend of races” of women in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] resulted because, historically, [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] became a part of [[Azerbaijan]] after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall and disintegration]] of the [[Soviet Union]].  However, after the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]] in the 1988 to 1994, Nagorno-Karabakh is currently occupied and governed by [[Armenia]].  The declaration of independence by Nagorno-Karabakh had not been endorsed by Armenia and Azerbaijan.  At present, Nagorno-Karabakh is not officially recognized as a ''[[de facto]]'' nation by the [[international community]].&lt;ref name=Westerberg&gt;[http://www.kvinnatillkvinna.se/en/article/3408 Peace in Nagorno-Karabakh requires preparation], November 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

For these reasons, some Nagorno-Karabakh women took roles in [[peacebuilding]] for the benefit of the place they are now calling as their country and home.  The expanse belonging to what is now known geographically as Nagorno-Karabakh is still officially and technically considered as a part of Azerbaijan.  [[Women's organization]]s based in both Azerbaijan and Armenia, are the key supporters for the peace building endeavor in Nagorno-Karabakh since 2004.  Some of the organizations involved include the Women's Resource Center in [[Yerevan, Armenia]] and the [[Kvinna till Kvinna Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Westerberg/&gt;

The efforts taken by the women of Nagorno-Karabakh include conducting peace building consultations and forums such as the “Nagorno-Karabakh women for peace and peaceful coexistence” conference in July 2002 which was held at [[Stepanakert]], the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh.&lt;ref name=PanArm&gt;[http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/politics/news/2883/ «NAGORNO-KARABAKH WOMEN FOR PEACE AND PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE» CONFERENCE TO TAKE PLACE IN STEPANAKERT], PanARMENIAN.Net, July 23, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  The topics tackled during the conferences and forums incorporated the role of women as peacekeepers, the “consolidation of democracy” in the region, [[human rights]] situations in the area, enforcement of peaceful coexistence, analysis of the consequences of war and conflict,&lt;ref name=PanArm/&gt; dialogue between communities, peaceful settlement of disagreements, protection of women and children, socio-economic and political issues, and “post-conflict rehabilitation of the region”.&lt;ref name=PanArm2&gt;[http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/politics/news/2812/NAGORNOKARABAKH_WOMEN_WISH_TO_CONTRIBUTE_TO_REGIONAL_CONFLICTS_PEACEFUL_SETTLEMENT NAGORNO-KARABAKH WOMEN WISH TO CONTRIBUTE TO REGIONAL CONFLICTS PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT], PanARMENIAN.Net, July 29, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
