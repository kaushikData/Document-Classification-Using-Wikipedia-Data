'''The Myrtle Beach tornadoes''' were [[Fujita Scale|F1]] and [[Fujita Scale|F2]] [[tornadoes]] which touched down in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]] on Friday, July&amp;nbsp;6, 2001. At 4:05 PM EDT, the first tornado touched down. It crossed [[U.S. Route 17 in South Carolina|U.S. Route 17]] in [[North Myrtle Beach]] while reaching a maximum width of 100 yards. It was estimated to be an F1 in strength, and was on the ground for 0.1 miles. The other tornado affected [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] and four damage paths were found. The longest path, which could have been the parent tornado, spanned for 2 miles from 4:15 to 4:25 PM EDT and was estimated to have F2 strength.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/ilm/MyrtleBeachTornadoes2001track|title=Myrtle Beach Tornadoes:  July 6, 2001 -- Track Analysis|last=Service|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather|website=www.weather.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tornado moved slowly southward along the beach, alternately moving on and offshore several times, and caused significant damage, including blown-out windows, tipped-over buses, and damaged roofs and utility poles. Thirty-nine people received minor injuries from this second tornado, which was rated F2. No serious injuries or fatalities were associated with this storm event.

Near southern [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]], evidence was found for three other damage paths that were estimated to have F0 and F1 strength. These tornadoes caused roof and tree damage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
== Damage ==
The storm that produced these tornadoes occurred during the Fourth of July weekend as an estimated 400,000 vacationers were at Myrtle Beach. Damage from the tornadoes is estimated to be up to $8,000,000 - with an estimated $1,000,000 damages associated with vehicles. 4,000 residents were without power during the worst parts of the storm. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/ilm/MyrtleBeachTornadoes2001|title=Myrtle Beach Tornadoes:  July 6, 2001|last=Service|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather|website=www.weather.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3229">[[Image:4-1000A linear RF deck build by K5LAD.jpg|thumb|upright|right|4-1000A Power Tube]]

'''The 4-1000A/8166''' is a radial-beam tetrode designed for use in radio transmitters.  The 4-1000A is the largest of a series of tubes including the 4-65A, 4-125A, 4-250A, and the 4-400A.  These tubes share a common naming convention in which the first number identifies the number of elements contained within the tube; ''i.e.'', the number “4” identifies the tube as a tetrode which contains four elements (filament, control grid, screen grid, and anode), and the second number indicates the maximum continuous power dissipation of the anode in Watts.  The entire family of tubes can be used as oscillators, modulators, and amplifiers.

== Specifications ==
The 4-1000A is a relatively large glass tube with an overall height of 9.25 inches and a diameter of 5 inches.  It is designed to operate with its plate (anode) at an orange-red color due to the "getter" being a zirconium compound on the anode structure which requires a great deal of heat to be effective.  The cathode is a directly-heated, [[thorium|thoriated]]-tungsten filament rated at 7.5 volts at 21 [[ampere]]s.  Connections to the filament and grids are made via a special 5-pin socket, and the anode connection is at the top of the tube.

The tube may be operated as a [[class C amplifier]] in which a single tube can provide up to 3340 watts of RF power.  A pair of tubes may be operated as an audio-frequency [[modulator]] for an AM transmitter; in this case a pair of tubes will provide up to 3,840 watts of audio power.&lt;ref&gt;Data sheet for the Eimac 4-1000A&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internal construction ==
The 4-1000A is of radial construction; the most obvious feature is the large, roughly cylindrical, blackish anode suspended from the top of the tube.  The anode, which may be constructed out of metal or graphite, is finned for increased heat dissipation.  The filament and grids are supported from the lower section/base of the tube.

== Sources ==
The 4-1000A was available from multiple manufacturers including [[RCA]],&lt;ref&gt;RCA Transmitting Tubes TT4, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eimac|EIMAC]],&lt;ref&gt;EIMAC Power Grid Tubes Quick Reference Catalog 175&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amperex Electronic|AMPEREX]], and Triton.

== Cooling ==
A complete cooling system is required to operate the tube at rated values.  A [[centrifugal fan]] pressurizes the equipment [[chassis]] and provides a continuous stream of cooling air.  A specially designed socket is used to direct the air over the filament and grid connections, and a glass chimney (Pyrex®) then directs the air around the tube's glass envelope; chassis-mounted metal clips are used to center the chimney around the tube.  Finally, a finned, cylindrical [[heat sink]] is attached to the anode connection (top of the tube) to provide additional cooling for the  anode's glass-to-metal seal.

==Variants==
The 4-1000A was modified for operation in pulsed applications; the modified tube, identified as the 4PR1000A/8189, can be operated with anode voltages as high as 30 kV DC and peak plate current of 8.0 Amperes, but at a reduced duty cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Data sheet for EIMAC 8189 / 4PR1000A&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|Electrical busbar system in an electrical cabinet refer to|Electrical busbar system }}
[[Image:Busbars.jpg|thumb|upright|1500 [[ampere]] [[copper]] busbars within a power distribution rack for a large building]]
[[Image:T_ratings_oldest_trick_in_the_book_006.png|thumb|Busbar with [[plastic]] wrapping inside of a [[Bus Ducts|bus duct]]]]

In  [[electric power distribution]], a '''busbar'''  (also '''bus bar''') is a metallic strip or bar, typically housed inside [[switchgear]], [[Distribution board|panel boards]], and [[Bus Ducts|busway enclosures]] for local high current power distribution. They are also used to connect high voltage equipment at electrical switchyards, and low voltage equipment in [[Battery (electrical)|battery bank]]s. They are generally uninsulated, and have sufficient stiffness to be supported in air by insulated pillars. These features allow sufficient cooling of the conductors, and the ability to tap in at various points without creating a new joint. 

(The term busbar is derived from the Latin word ''[[wikt|omnibus]]'', which translates into English as "for all", indicating that a busbar carries all of the currents in a particular system.)
  
==Design and placement==
The material composition and cross-sectional size of the busbar determine the maximum amount of current that can be safely carried. Busbars can have a cross-sectional area of as little as {{convert|10|mm2}}, but [[electrical substation]]s may use metal tubes {{convert|50|mm}} in diameter ({{convert|20|mm2}}) or more as busbars. An [[aluminium smelter]] will have very large busbars used to carry tens of thousands of [[ampere]]s to the [[electrochemical cell]]s that [[Hall–Héroult process|produce aluminium]] from molten [[salts]].

Busbars are produced in a variety of shapes, such as flat strips, solid bars, or rods, and are typically composed of [[copper]], [[brass]], or [[aluminium]] as solid or hollow tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copperalliance.org.uk/docs/librariesprovider5/pub-22-copper-for-busbars/copper-for-busbars-all-sections.pdf?sfvrsn=2|format=PDF|title=Copper for Busbars : Guidance for Design and Installation|website=Copperalliance.org.uk|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these shapes allow [[heat]] to dissipate more efficiently due to their high [[surface area]] to [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional]] area ratio. The [[skin effect]] makes [[Utility frequency|50–60 Hz]] [[alternating current|AC]] busbars more than about {{convert|8|mm|in}} thickness inefficient, so hollow or flat shapes are prevalent in higher current applications. A hollow section also has higher [[stiffness]] than a solid rod of equivalent current-carrying capacity, which allows a greater span between busbar supports in outdoor [[Electrical substation|electrical switchyard]]s.  

A busbar must be sufficiently rigid to support its own weight, and forces imposed by mechanical [[vibration]] and possibly [[earthquake]]s, as well as accumulated [[Precipitation types|precipitation]] in outdoor exposures.  In addition, [[thermal expansion]] from temperature changes induced by [[ohmic heating]] and ambient temperature variations, as well as [[magnetic force]]s induced by large currents, must be considered. In order to address these concerns, flexible bus bars, typically a sandwich of thin conductor layers, were developed. These require a structural frame or cabinet for their installation.

Distribution boards split the electrical supply into separate circuits at one location. Busways, or bus ducts, are long busbars with a protective cover. Rather than branching from the main supply at one location, they allow new circuits to branch off anywhere along the route of the busway.

A busbar may either be supported on insulators, or else insulation may completely surround it. Busbars are protected from accidental contact either by a metal earthed enclosure or by elevation out of normal reach. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starlinepower.com/busbar-faq/|title=What is a Busbar &amp; Other FAQs on Electrical Copper Busbars|website=Starlinepower.com|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power [[Ground and neutral|neutral]] busbars may also be insulated because it is not guaranteed that the potential between power neutral and safety grounding is always zero. [[Ground and neutral|Earthing]] (safety grounding) busbars are typically bare and bolted directly onto any metal chassis of their enclosure. Busbars may be enclosed in a metal housing, in the form of bus duct or busway, segregated-phase bus, or [[isolated-phase bus]].

Busbars may be connected to each other and to electrical apparatus by bolted, clamped, or welded connections. Often, joints between high-current bus sections have precisely-machined matching surfaces that are [[Plating#Silver plating|silver-plated]] to reduce the [[contact resistance]].  At [[extra high voltage]]s (more than 300 kV) in outdoor buses, [[corona discharge]] around the connections becomes a source of [[radio-frequency interference]] and [[power loss]], so special connection fittings designed for these voltages are used.

A '''carboxylate''' is a [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] or [[ester]] of a [[carboxylic acid]].
''Carboxylate salts'' have the general formula M(RCOO)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, where M is a metal and ''n'' is 1,&amp;nbsp;2,...; ''carboxylate esters'' have the general formula RCOOR′. R and R′ are organic groups; R′&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;H.

A '''carboxylate ion''' is the [[conjugate base]] of a carboxylic acid, RCOO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. It is an [[ion]] with [[negative charge]].

== Resonance stabilization of the carboxylate ion==
Carboxylic acids easily dissociate into a carboxylate anion and a positively charged hydrogen ion (proton), much more readily than alcohols do (into an [[alkoxide]] ion and a proton), because the carboxylate ion is stabilized by [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]]. The negative charge that is left after [[deprotonation]] of the carboxyl group is delocalized between the two [[electronegative]] oxygen atoms in a resonance structure.

:[[File:Carboxylate-resonance-2D.png|400px|Equivalence of the resonance forms the delocalised form of a general carboxylate anion]]

This [[delocalization]] of the electron cloud means that both of the oxygen atoms are less strongly negatively charged; the positive proton is therefore less strongly attracted back to the carboxylate group once it has left; hence, the carboxylate ion is more stable. In contrast, an alkoxide ion, once formed, would have a strong negative charge on the oxygen atom, which would make it difficult for the proton to escape. Carboxylic acids thus have a lower [[pH]] than alcohols: the higher the number of protons in solution, the lower the pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Fox|first1= Marye Anne|last2= Whitesell|first2= James K. | year = 1997 | title = Organic Chemistry | edition = 2nd|  publisher = Jones and Bartlett Publishers | location = Sudbury, MA| isbn = 0-7637-0178-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ceresin''' (also '''cerin''', '''cerasin''', '''cerosin''', '''ceresin wax''' or '''ceresine''') is a [[wax]] derived from [[ozokerite]] by a purifying process.

The purifying process of the ozokerite commonly comprises a treatment with heat and [[sulfuric acid]], but other processes are also in use.

Uses include:
* An alternative to [[beeswax]] in ointments
* (Historic) Laboratory-supply bottles for small amounts of [[hydrofluoric acid]], which were made of ceresin wax; this was before [[polyethylene]] became commonplace.

'''Construction aggregate''', or simply "''[[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]]''", is a broad category of coarse to medium grained particulate material used in [[construction]], including [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[crushed stone]], [[slag]], recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates.  Aggregates are the most mined materials in the world. Aggregates are a component of [[composite material]]s such as [[concrete]] and [[asphalt concrete]]; the aggregate serves as reinforcement to add strength to the overall composite material. Due to the relatively high hydraulic conductivity value as compared to most soils, aggregates are widely used in drainage applications such as foundation and [[French drains]], septic drain fields, retaining wall drains, and road side edge drains.  Aggregates are also used as base material under foundations, roads, and [[railroad]]s. In other words, aggregates are used as a stable foundation or [[aggregate base|road/rail base]] with predictable, uniform properties (e.g. to help prevent differential settling under the road or building), or as a low-cost extender that binds with more expensive cement or asphalt to form concrete.

Preferred bitumenous aggregate sizes for road construction are given in EN 13043 as d/D (where the range shows the smallest and largest square mesh grating that the particles can pass).  The same classification sizing is used for larger armour stone sizes in EN 13383, EN 12620 for concrete aggregate, EN 13242 for [[base course|base layers]] of road construction and EN 13450 for railway ballast.

The [[American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM) publishes an exhaustive listing of specifications including ASTM D 692 and ASTM D 1073 for various construction aggregate products, which, by their individual design, are suitable for specific construction purposes.  These products include specific types of coarse and fine aggregate designed for such uses as additives to asphalt and concrete mixes, as well as other construction uses.  State transportation departments further refine aggregate material specifications in order to tailor aggregate use to the needs and available supply in their particular locations.

Sources for these basic materials can be grouped into three main areas: Mining of mineral aggregate deposits, including sand, gravel, and stone; use of waste slag from the manufacture of iron and steel; and recycling of concrete, which is itself chiefly manufactured from mineral aggregates.  In addition, there are some (minor) materials that are used as specialty lightweight aggregates: [[clay]], [[pumice]], [[perlite]], and [[vermiculite]].

==History==
People have used sand and stone for foundations for thousands of years.  Significant refinement of the production and use of aggregate occurred during the [[Roman Empire]], which used aggregate to build its vast network of roads and aqueducts.  The invention of concrete, which was essential to architecture utilizing arches, created an immediate, permanent demand for construction aggregates.

[[Vitruvius]] writes in [[Wikiquote:Vitruvius#De architectura .28The Ten Books On Architecture.29 .28.7E 15BC.29|''De architectura'']]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Economy denotes the proper management of materials and of site, as well as a thrifty balancing of cost and common sense in the construction of works. This will be observed if, in the first place, the architect does not demand things which cannot be found or made ready without great expense. For example: it is not everywhere that there is plenty of [[w:Construction aggregate#History|pit-sand]], rubble, fir, clear fir, and marble... Where there is no pit sand, we must use the kinds washed up by rivers or by the sea... and other problems we must solve in similar ways.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern production==
The advent of modern blasting methods enabled the development of [[quarry|quarries]], which are now used throughout the world, wherever competent bedrock deposits of aggregate quality exist.  In many places, good [[limestone]], [[granite]], [[marble]] or other quality stone [[bedrock]] deposits do not exist.  In these areas, natural sand and gravel are [[mining|mined]] for use as aggregate.  Where neither stone, nor sand and gravel, are available, construction demand is usually satisfied by shipping in aggregate by rail, [[barge]] or [[truck]].  Additionally, demand for aggregates can be partially satisfied through the use of slag and recycled [[concrete]].  However, the available tonnages and lesser quality of these materials prevent them from being a viable replacement for mined aggregates on a large scale.

[[Image:Point San Pedro 07798.JPG|left|thumb|Over 1 million tons annually are mined from this quarry near [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Robinson | first = Roberta | title = Who’s Minding the San Rafael Rock Quarry? | publisher = Marin County Civil Grand Jury | date = June 2001 | url = http://www.marincounty.org/~/media/files/departments/gj/reports-responses/2000/srrqrept.pdf | accessdate = 2008-01-03 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170120054540/http://www.marincounty.org/~/media/files/departments/gj/reports-responses/2000/srrqrept.pdf | archivedate = 2017-01-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Large stone quarry and sand and gravel operations exist near virtually all population centers due to the high cost of transportation relative to the low value of the product.  Trucking aggregate more than 40 kilometers is typically uneconomical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bridge|first1=Tyee|title=Sand?  Mine!|url=https://www.hakaimagazine.com/features/sand-mine|accessdate=22 September 2017|work=[[Hakai Magazine]]|date=13 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923050838/https://www.hakaimagazine.com/features/sand-mine|archivedate=23 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These are [[Capital (economics)|capital]]-intensive operations, utilizing large earth-moving equipment, belt conveyors, and machines specifically designed for [[Rock crusher|crushing]] and separating various sizes of aggregate, to create distinct product stockpiles.

According to the [[USGS]], 2006 U.S. crushed stone production was 1.72 billion tonnes valued at $13.8 billion (compared to 1.69 billion tonnes valued at $12.1 billion in 2005), of which limestone was 1,080 million tonnes valued at $8.19 billion from 1,896 quarries, granite was 268 million tonnes valued at $2.59 billion from 378 quarries, traprock was 148 million tonnes valued at $1.04 billion from 355 quarries, and the balance other kinds of stone from 729 quarries.  Limestone and granite are also produced in large amounts as [[dimension stone]].  The great majority of crushed stone is moved by heavy truck from the quarry/plant to the first point of sale or use.  According to the [[USGS]], 2006 U.S. sand and gravel production was 1.32 billion tonnes valued at $8.54 billion (compared to 1.27 billion tonnes valued at $7.46 billion in 2005), of which 264 million tonnes valued at $1.92 billion was used as concrete aggregates.  The great majority of this was again moved by truck, instead of by [[electric locomotive|electric train]].

Currently, total U.S. aggregate demand by final market sector was 30%–35% for non-residential building (offices, hotels, stores, manufacturing plants, government and institutional buildings, and others), 25% for highways, and 25% for housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=T.I.|author2=W.P. Bolen|date=June 2008|title=Construction Aggregates|journal=Mining Engineering|volume=60|pages=25–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recycled materials for aggregates==
The largest-volume of recycled material used as construction aggregate is [[blast furnace]] and steel furnace [[slag]].  Blast furnace slag is either air-cooled (slow cooling in the open) or granulated (formed by quenching molten slag in water to form sand-sized glass-like particles).  If the granulated blast furnace slag accesses free lime during hydration, it develops strong hydraulic cementitious properties and can partly substitute for [[portland cement]] in concrete.  Steel furnace slag is also air-cooled.  In 2006, according to the [[USGS]], air-cooled blast furnace slag sold or used in the U.S. was 7.3 million tonnes valued at $49 million, granulated blast furnace slag sold or used in the U.S. was 4.2 million tonnes valued at $318 million, and steel furnace slag sold or used in the U.S. was 8.7 million tonnes valued at $40 million.  Air-cooled blast furnace slag sales in 2006 were for use in [[base course|road bases]] and surfaces (41%), asphaltic concrete (13%), ready-mixed concrete (16%), and the balance for other uses.  Granulated blast furnace slag sales in 2006 were for use in cementitious materials (94%), and the balance for other uses.  Steel furnace slag sales in 2006 were for use in [[base course|road bases]] and surfaces (51%), asphaltic concrete (12%), for [[fill dirt|fill]] (18%), and the balance for other uses.

Glass aggregate, a mix of colors crushed to a small size, is substituted for many construction and utility projects in place of pea gravel or crushed rock, often saving municipalities like the City of [[Tumwater, Washington]] [[Public Works]], thousands of dollars (depending on the size of the project). Glass aggregate is not sharp to handle. In many cases, the state Department of Transportation has specifications for use, size and percentage of quantity for use. Common applications are as pipe bedding—placed around sewer, storm water or drinking water pipes to transfer weight from the surface and protect the pipe. Another common use would be as fill to bring the level of a concrete floor even with a foundation.  Use of glass aggregate helps close the loop in [[glass recycling]] in many places where glass cannot be smelted into new glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/wtert/sofos/meyer_egosi_paper.pdf |title=Concrete with Waste Glass as Aggregate |publisher=ASCE |accessdate=2011-09-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330202428/http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/wtert/sofos/meyer_egosi_paper.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggregates themselves can be recycled as aggregates.  Unlike deposits of sand and gravel or stone suitable for crushing into aggregate, which can be anywhere and may require overburden removal and/or blasting, "deposits" of recyclable aggregate tend to be concentrated near urban areas, and production from them cannot be raised or lowered to meet demand for aggregates.  Supply of recycled aggregate depends on physical decay of structures and their demolition.  The recycling plant can be fixed or mobile; the smaller capacity mobile plant works best for asphalt-aggregate recycling.  The material being recycled is usually highly variable in quality and properties.

Many aggregate products of various types are recycled for other industrial purposes with economic and environmental benefits to the local and surrounding area.  Contractors save on disposal costs and less aggregate is buried or piled and abandoned. In [[Bay City, Michigan]], for example, a recycle program exists for unused products such as mixed concrete, block, brick, gravel, pea stone, and other used materials. The material is crushed to provide subbase for roads and driveways, among other purposes.

According to the [[USGS]] in 2006, 2.9 million tonnes of Portland cement concrete (including aggregate) worth $21.9 million was recycled, and 1.6 million tonnes of asphalt concrete (including aggregate) worth $11.8 million was recycled, both by crushed stone operations.  Much more of both materials are recycled by construction and demolition firms not in the USGS survey.  For sand and gravel, the USGS survey for 2006 showed that 4.7 million tonnes of cement concrete valued at $32.0 million was recycled, and 6.17 million tonnes of asphalt concrete valued at $45.1 million was recycled.  Again, more of both materials are recycled by construction and demolition firms not in this USGS survey.  The Construction Materials Recycling Association indicates that there are 325 million tonnes of recoverable construction and demolition materials produced annually.

Many geosynthetic aggregates are also made from recycled materials.  Being polymer based, recyclable plastics can be reused in the production of these new age of aggregates.  For example, Ring Industrial Group's EZflow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ezflowlp.com/ |title=EZflow by Infiltrator Systems |publisher=Ezflowlp.com |accessdate=2009-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306230755/http://www.ezflowlp.com/ |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; product lines are produced with geosynthetic aggregate pieces that are more than 99.9% recycled polystyrene.  This polystyrene, that would have otherwise been destined for a landfill, is instead gathered, melted, mixed, reformulated and expanded to create low density aggregates that maintain high strength properties while under compressive loads.  Such geosynthetic aggregates replace conventional gravel while simultaneously increasing porosity, increasing hydraulic conductivity and eliminating the fine dust "fines" inherent to gravel aggregates which otherwise serve to clog and disrupt the operation of many drainage applications.

===Recycled aggregate production in the UK===
Recycled aggregate in the UK is defined as aggregate resulting from the processing of inorganic material previously used in [[construction]]. To ensure the aggregate is [[Chemically inert|inert]], it is manufactured from material tested and characterised under [[Waste characterisation|European Waste Codes]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grdp.org/static/documents/EWC_31-03-09_CH.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, 210 million tonnes of aggregate were produced in the UK of which 67 million tonnes was recycled product, according to the Quarry Products Association (QPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qpa.org/prod_agg_recy01.htm |title=MPA – Mineral Products Association – Products |publisher=Qpa.org |accessdate=2009-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505031332/http://www.qpa.org/prod_agg_recy01.htm |archivedate=2009-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Waste and Resource Action Programme (WRAP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrap.org.uk/construction/ |title=Construction Sector Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme |publisher=WRAP |accessdate=2009-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417163329/http://www.wrap.org.uk/construction/ |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has produced a Quality Protocol for the regulated production of recycled aggregates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aggregain.org.uk/quality/quality_protocols/ |title=Quality Protocol for Aggregates |publisher=Aggregain.org.uk |accessdate=2009-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417185313/http://www.aggregain.org.uk/quality/quality_protocols/ |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recycled aggregate is delivered with documentation that states it has been produced using a quality assured system for the manufacturing process to ensure an aggregate that conforms to the relevant European standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aggregain.org.uk/quality/aggregates_standards/european.html |title=European Standards |publisher=Aggregain.org.uk |date=2004-06-01 |accessdate=2009-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106160154/http://www.aggregain.org.uk/quality/aggregates_standards/european.html |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dryrock''' is the term used for processed [[phosphate]] [[rock (geology)|rock]], used in the production of agricultural [[fertilizer]]. Dryrock requires protection from the weather, and so is always shipped by [[Rail transport|rail]] using [[covered hopper]] and [[Gondola (rail)|gondola]] cars.

An '''eclipse''' is an [[astronomical event]] that occurs when an [[astronomical object]] is temporarily obscured, either by passing into the shadow of another body or by having another body pass between it and the viewer. This alignment of three celestial objects is known as a [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=Staff |date=March 31, 1981 |publisher=The New York Times |title=Science Watch: A Really Big Syzygy |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9F02E5DB1039F932A05750C0A967948260&amp;fta=y |accessdate=2008-02-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210100651/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9F02E5DB1039F932A05750C0A967948260&amp;fta=y |archivedate=December 10, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from syzygy, the term eclipse is also used when a spacecraft reaches a position where it can observe two celestial bodies so aligned. An eclipse is the result of either an [[occultation]] (completely hidden) or a [[transit (astronomy)|transit]] (partially hidden).

The term eclipse is most often used to describe either a [[solar eclipse]], when the Moon's shadow crosses the Earth's surface, or a [[lunar eclipse]], when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow. However, it can also refer to such events beyond the Earth–Moon system: for example, a planet moving into the shadow cast by one of its moons, a moon passing into the shadow cast by its host planet, or a moon passing into the shadow of another moon. A [[binary star]] system can also produce eclipses if the plane of the orbit of its constituent stars intersects the observer's position.

For the special cases of solar and lunar eclipses, these only happen during an "[[eclipse season]]", the two times of each year when the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun crosses with the plane of the Moon's orbit around the Earth. The [[Solar eclipse#Types|type of solar eclipse]] that happens during each season (whether total, annular, hybrid, or partial) depends on [[apparent size]]s of the Sun and Moon. If the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, and the Moon's orbit around the Earth were both in the same plane with each other, then eclipses would happen each and every month. There would be a lunar eclipse at every full moon, and a solar eclipse at every new moon. And if both orbits were perfectly circular, then each solar eclipse would be the same type every month. It is because of the non-planar and non-circular differences that eclipses are not a common event. Lunar eclipses can be viewed from the entire nightside half of the Earth. But solar eclipses, particularly a total eclipse, as occurring at any one particular point on the Earth's surface, is a rare event that can span many decades from one to the next.

==Etymology==
The term is derived from the [[ancient Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|ἔκλειψις}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ékleipsis}}''), which means "the abandonment", "the downfall", or "the darkening of a heavenly body", which is derived from the verb {{lang|grc|ἐκλείπω}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ekleípō}}'') which means "to abandon", "to darken", or "to cease to exist,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.in.gr/dictionary/lookup.asp?Word=%E5%EA%EB%E5%DF%F0%F9+++&amp;x=0&amp;y=0  |accessdate=2009-09-24 |df= |title=Https://www.in.gr/dictionary/lookup.asp/?Word=%E5%EA%EB%E5%DF%F0%F9+++&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of prefix {{lang|grc|ἐκ-}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ek-}}''), from preposition {{lang|grc|ἐκ}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|ek}}''), "out," and of verb {{lang|grc|λείπω}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|leípō}}''), "to be absent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lingvozone.com/main.jsp?action=translation&amp;do=dictionary&amp;language_id_from=23&amp;language_id_to=8&amp;word=%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%80%CF%89+&amp;t.x=55&amp;t.y=16|title=Free online English Greek dictionary.

{{Main|Umbra, penumbra and antumbra}}

[[File:Umbra01.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Umbra, penumbra and antumbra cast by an opaque object occulting a larger light source]]
For any two objects in space, a line can be extended from the first through the second. The latter object will block some amount of light being emitted by the former, creating a region of shadow around the axis of the line. Typically these objects are moving with respect to each other and their surroundings, so the resulting shadow will sweep through a region of space, only passing through any particular location in the region for a fixed interval of time. As viewed from such a location, this shadowing event is known as an eclipse.&lt;ref name=westfall2014&gt;{{citation | title=Celestial Shadows: Eclipses, Transits, and Occultations | volume=410 | series=Astrophysics and Space Science Library | first1=John | last1=Westfall | first2=William | last2=Sheehan | publisher=Springer | year=2014 | isbn=978-1493915354 | pages=1−5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9mLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1 | postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically the cross-section of the objects involved in an astronomical eclipse are roughly disk shaped.&lt;ref name=westfall2014/&gt; The region of an object's shadow during an eclipse is divided into three parts:&lt;ref name=glossary&gt;{{cite web | last=Espenak | first=Fred | date=September 21, 2007 | url=http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/SEglossary.html | title=Glossary of Solar Eclipse Terms | publisher=NASA | accessdate=2008-02-28 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224074526/http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/SEglossary.html | archivedate=February 24, 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[umbra]]'', within which the object completely covers the light source. For the [[Sun]], this light source is the photosphere.
* The ''antumbra'', extending beyond the tip of the umbra, within which the object is completely in front of the light source but too small to completely cover it.
* The ''penumbra'', within which the object is only partially in front of the light source.

[[File:Solar eclipse types.svg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|Sun-moon configurations that produce a total (A), annular (B), and partial (C) solar eclipse]]
A '''total eclipse''' occurs when the observer is within the umbra, an annular eclipse when the observer is within the antumbra, and a partial eclipse when the observer is within the penumbra. During a lunar eclipse only the umbra and penumbra are applicable. This is because Earth's apparent diameter from the viewpoint of the Moon is nearly four times that of the Sun. The same terms may be used analogously in describing other eclipses, e.g., the antumbra of Deimos crossing Mars, or Phobos entering Mars's penumbra.

The ''first contact'' occurs when the eclipsing object's disc first starts to impinge on the light source; ''second contact'' is when the disc moves completely within the light source; ''third contact'' when it starts to move out of the light; and ''fourth'' or ''last contact'' when it finally leaves the light source's disc entirely.

For spherical bodies, when the occulting object is smaller than the star, the length (''L'') of the umbra's cone-shaped shadow is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;L\ =\ \frac{r \cdot R_o}{R_s - R_o}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the radius of the star, ''R&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the occulting object's radius, and ''r'' is the distance from the star to the occulting object. For [[Earth]], on average ''L'' is equal to 1.384{{e|6}}&amp;nbsp;[[kilometer|km]], which is much larger than the Moon's [[semimajor axis]] of 3.844{{e|5}}&amp;nbsp;km. Hence the umbral cone of the Earth can completely envelop the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This occurs, for example, during an eclipse of the Moon by the Earth&amp;mdash;producing a faint, [[red|ruddy]] illumination of the Moon even at totality.

On Earth, the shadow cast during an eclipse moves very approximately at 1&amp;nbsp;km per sec. This depends on the location of the shadow on the Earth and the angle in which it is moving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciforums.com/threads/speed-of-eclipse-shadow.53722/|title=Speed of eclipse shadow? - Sciforums|author=|date=|website=sciforums.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402094757/http://www.sciforums.com/threads/speed-of-eclipse-shadow.53722/|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eclipse cycles ==
{{Main|Eclipse cycle}}

An [[eclipse cycle]] takes place when eclipses in a series are separated by a certain interval of time. This happens when the orbital motions of the bodies form repeating harmonic patterns. A particular instance is the [[saros (astronomy)|saros]], which results in a repetition of a solar or lunar eclipse every 6,585.3&amp;nbsp;days, or a little over 18 years. Because this is not a whole number of days, successive eclipses will be visible from different parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Lunar eclipse diagram-en.svg|240px|thumb|A symbolic orbital diagram from the view of the Earth at the center, with the sun and moon projected upon the [[celestial sphere]], showing the Moon's two nodes where eclipses can occur.]]
An eclipse involving the Sun, Earth, and Moon can occur only when they are nearly in a straight line, allowing one to be hidden behind another, viewed from the third. Because the [[orbit of the Moon|orbital plane of the Moon]] is tilted with respect to the orbital plane of the Earth (the [[ecliptic]]), eclipses can occur only when the Moon is close to the intersection of these two planes (the [[node (astronomy)|node]]s). The Sun, Earth and nodes are aligned twice a year (during an [[eclipse season]]), and eclipses can occur during a period of about two months around these times. There can be from four to seven eclipses in a calendar year, which repeat according to various [[eclipse cycle]]s, such as a [[saros (astronomy)|saros]].

Between 1901 and 2100 there are the maximum of seven eclipses in:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moonblink.info/Eclipse/lists/stats|title=Eclipse Statistics|author=|date=|website=moonblink.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527212303/http://moonblink.info/Eclipse/lists/stats|archivedate=2014-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As observed from the Earth, a [[solar eclipse]] occurs when the Moon passes in front of the Sun. The type of solar eclipse event depends on the distance of the Moon from the Earth during the event. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Earth intersects the umbra portion of the Moon's shadow. When the umbra does not reach the surface of the Earth, the Sun is only partially occulted, resulting in an annular eclipse. Partial solar eclipses occur when the viewer is inside the penumbra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Magnitude of eclipse|eclipse magnitude]] is the fraction of the Sun's diameter that is covered by the Moon. For a total eclipse, this value is always greater than or equal to one. In both annular and total eclipses, the eclipse magnitude is the ratio of the angular sizes of the Moon to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Solar eclipses are relatively brief events that can only be viewed in totality along a relatively narrow track. Under the most favorable circumstances, a total solar eclipse can last for 7&amp;nbsp;minutes, 31&amp;nbsp;seconds, and can be viewed along a track that is up to 250&amp;nbsp;km wide. However, the region where a partial eclipse can be observed is much larger. The Moon's umbra will advance eastward at a rate of 1,700&amp;nbsp;km/h, until it no longer intersects the Earth's surface.

[[File:Geometry of a Total Solar Eclipse.svg|thumb|300px|right|Geometry of a total solar eclipse (not to scale)]]

During a solar eclipse, the Moon can sometimes perfectly cover the Sun because its apparent size is nearly the same as the Sun's when viewed from the Earth. A total solar eclipse is in fact an [[occultation]] while an annular solar eclipse is a [[Astronomical transit|transit]].

When observed at points in space other than from the Earth's surface, the Sun can be eclipsed by bodies other than the Moon. Two examples include when the crew of [[Apollo 12]] observed the [[:File:Earth Eclipses Sun-ap12-s80-37406.jpg|Earth to eclipse the Sun]] in 1969 and when the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] [[Space probe|probe]] observed [[:File:Saturn eclipse.jpg|Saturn to eclipse the Sun]] in 2006.

[[Image:Eclipse lune.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The progression of a [[lunar eclipse]] from right to left. Totality is shown with the first two images. These required a longer [[exposure time]] to make the details visible.]]

Lunar eclipses occur when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow. This happens only during a [[full moon]], when the Moon is on the far side of the Earth from the Sun. Unlike a solar eclipse, an eclipse of the Moon can be observed from nearly an entire hemisphere. For this reason it is much more common to observe a lunar eclipse from a given location. A lunar eclipse lasts longer, taking several hours to complete, with totality itself usually averaging anywhere from about 30 minutes to over an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are three types of lunar eclipses: penumbral, when the Moon crosses only the Earth's penumbra; partial, when the Moon crosses partially into the Earth's [[umbra]]; and total, when the Moon crosses entirely into the Earth's umbra. Total lunar eclipses pass through all three phases. Even during a total lunar eclipse, however, the Moon is not completely dark. Sunlight refracted through the Earth's atmosphere enters the umbra and provides a faint illumination. Much as in a sunset, the atmosphere tends to more strongly scatter light with shorter wavelengths, so the illumination of the Moon by refracted light has a red hue,&lt;ref&gt;

The most striking involve [[Jupiter]], which has four large moons and a low [[axial tilt]], making eclipses more frequent as these bodies pass through the shadow of the larger planet. Transits occur with equal frequency. It is common to see the larger moons casting circular shadows upon Jupiter's cloudtops.

The eclipses of the [[Galilean moon]]s by Jupiter became accurately predictable once their orbital elements were known. During the 1670s, it was discovered that these events were occurring about 17 minutes later than expected when Jupiter was on the far side of the Sun. [[Ole Rømer]] deduced that the delay was caused by the time needed for light to travel from Jupiter to the Earth. This was used to produce the first estimate of the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other three [[gas giant]]s, eclipses only occur at certain periods during the planet's orbit, due to their higher [[inclination]] between the orbits of the moon and the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] of the planet. The moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], for example, has an orbital plane tilted about 1.6° to Saturn's equatorial plane. But Saturn has an axial tilt of nearly 27°. The orbital plane of Titan only crosses the line of sight to the Sun at two points along Saturn's orbit. As the orbital period of Saturn is 29.7&amp;nbsp;years, an eclipse is only possible about every 15 years.

The timing of the Jovian satellite eclipses was also used to calculate an observer's [[longitude]] upon the Earth. By knowing the expected time when an eclipse would be observed at a standard longitude (such as [[Greenwich]]), the time difference could be computed by accurately observing the local time of the eclipse. The time difference gives the longitude of the observer because every hour of difference corresponded to 15° around the Earth's equator. This technique was used, for example, by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Giovanni D. Cassini]] in 1679 to re-map [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Transits of Venus occur in pairs separated by an interval of eight years, but each pair of events happen less than once a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Espenak |first=Fred |date=May 29, 2007 |url=http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/transit/transit.html |title=Planetary Transits Across the Sun |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2008-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311033452/http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/transit/transit.html |archivedate=March 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to NASA, the next pair of transits will occur on December 10, 2117 and December 8, 2125. Transits on Mercury are much more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/when-will-next-transits-mercury-and-venus-occur-during-total-solar-eclipse|title=When will the next transits of Mercury and Venus occur during a total solar eclipse? {{!}} Total Solar Eclipse 2017|website=eclipse2017.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918151937/https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/when-will-next-transits-mercury-and-venus-occur-during-total-solar-eclipse|archivedate=2017-09-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eclipsing binaries==
A [[binary star]] system consists of two stars that orbit around their common [[centre of mass]]. The movements of both stars lie on a common [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] in space. When this plane is very closely aligned with the location of an observer, the stars can be seen to pass in front of each other. The result is a type of extrinsic [[variable star]] system called an [[eclipsing binary]].

The maximum [[luminosity]] of an eclipsing binary system is equal to the sum of the luminosity contributions from the individual stars. When one star passes in front of the other, the luminosity of the system is seen to decrease. The luminosity returns to normal once the two stars are no longer in alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first eclipsing binary star system to be discovered was [[Algol]], a star system in the constellation [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]]. Normally this star system has a [[visual magnitude]] of 2.1. However, every 2.867 days the magnitude decreases to 3.4 for more than nine hours. This is caused by the passage of the dimmer member of the pair in front of the brighter star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Fluid Equipment Development Company''' ('''FEDCO''') is a Michigan-based designer and manufacturer of high-pressure feed [[pumps]] and [[brine]] [[energy recovery]] devices (ERDs) for [[brackish water]] reverse osmosis (BWRO) and seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) systems.  With over 3,500 units in service, FEDCO pumps and ERDs can be found on 6 continents, specifically in areas with little freshwater and rainfall or dense populations.  Reverse osmosis (RO) applications including SWRO plants, [[boiler feedwater]], [[oil platforms]], [[ocean liners]], military systems, hotels and resorts.

RO is most commonly used to make [[potable water]] from sea-water by removing salt and other impurities.  In other cases it is used to purify water for cleaning of sensitive materials/parts and electrical power generation.

The RO process requires one or several high-pressure pumps and an energy and dollar saving&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desalination.biz/marketplace/details.asp?cid=59281] ''D&amp;WR.''

== History ==
In the early 1980s, Eli Oklejas was chief R&amp;D [[hydraulic]] designer and head of the R&amp;D lab at a major pump company. He was assigned the task of testing a piston-type RO energy recovery device. After dealing with several failures and being frustrated by the overall system complexity, he proposed development of a turbocharger device to boost the feed pressure using brine hydraulic energy, however, the idea was not pursued.

Mr. Oklejas left to co-found Pump Engineering, Inc. where he served as president and he led the effort to develop turbochargers for RO applications until his departure in 1996. FEDCO was founded in 1997 as a partnership between Osmonics, Inc. and Eli Oklejas. FEDCO’s goal was to develop innovative high-pressure pumps and energy recovery devices.

General Electric became FEDCO’s partner from 2003 through 2006.&lt;ref&gt;"Monroe firm helps make water fit to drink."  The Toledo Blade [Toledo, OH] 3 August 2010. [http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2010/08/03/Monroe-firm-helps-world-make-water-fit-to-drink.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, FEDCO is 100% privately owned and has continued its focus on its growth in Michigan, innovation, quality and cost-effective solutions for pumping and energy recovery.&lt;ref&gt;"Dingell, Local Executives Join for Manufacturing Roundtable in Monroe."

Web. 09-June 2011.[http://dingell.house.gov/110/080703manufacturingroundtable.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This effort culminated with the introduction of the Hydraulic Pressure Booster (HPB) and the MSS series of high pressure feed pumps. Mr. Oklejas continues to serve as president of FEDCO as well as leading&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idadesal.org/t-energyconference_006.aspx] IDA Energy Conference. ''idadesal.org'' International Desalination Association.

Web. 13 June 2011.[http://www.desalination.biz/news/magazine_article.asp?id=5727&amp;title=Fluid+dynamics+secret+to+pressure-booster+record]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, FEDCO and Torishima Pump Manufacturing of Osaka, Japan announced the formation of Advanced Pumps International, a 50/50 joint venture company that will focus on developing and manufacturing pumping equipment for the oil and gas industries. The joint venture will be based in Monroe, Michigan, and plans to begin operations in the fall of 2012. Its products will be manufactured in accordance with API standards for a wide range of oil industry applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldpumps.com/view/26532/torishima-pump-and-fedco-form-jv-to-target-oil-gas-sector] ''World Pumps.'' World Pumps.com. Web. 25 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of FEDCO continues and its developments have been highlighted on the CBS’ Eye on America. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W8vUmsy5b8]  The segment, on business and technology, focuses on the increasing need for [[potable]] water and describes how energy recovery is playing a significant role in the selection of process equipment.

'''Goatskin''' refers to the [[skin]] of a [[goat]], which by long term usage, is denoted by the term ''[[Morocco leather]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt2275.html |title=Bookbinding and the Conservation of Books: A Dictionary of Descriptive Terminology |publisher=Cool.conservation-us.org |date=2011-11-19 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kidskin]], used for gloves, shoes and other accessories, is traditionally goatskin, although other leathers such as sheep and kangaroo can be used to make kid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cumming |first1=Valerie |title=Gloves |date=1982 |publisher=Batsford |location=London |isbn=9780713410082 |edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Frederick J.|title=The Shoe Industry|date=1916|publisher=Рипол Классик|isbn=9785874447977|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tanning (leather)|Tanned]] [[leather]] from goatskin is considered extremely durable and is commonly used to make [[Carpet|rug]]s (for example in Indonesia) and [[Carpet#Carpet binding|carpet binding]]. It is often used for [[glove]]s, [[boot]]s, and other products that require a soft hide. Kid gloves, popular in [[Victorian times]], are still made today. It has been a major material for leather [[bookbinding]]s for centuries, and the oldest European binding, that of the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] in the [[British Library]] is in red goatskin. Goatskin is used for a traditional Spanish container for wine [[bota bag]] (or called goatskin). Traditional [[kefir]] was made in bags from goatskin.

Non tanned goatskin is used for [[parchment]] or for [[drumhead]]s or [[sounding board]]s of some musical instruments, e.g., [[mišnice]] in medieval Europe, [[bodhrán]] in Ireland, [[esraj]] in India and for instrumental drum skin named ''[[bedug]]'' in Indonesia.

In [[Roman mythology]] priests of god [[Lupercalia]] wore goatskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Lupercalia.html |title=LacusCurtius • Roman Religion — The Lupercalia (Smith's Dictionary, 1875) |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date=2003-02-14 |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A breed of goat that provides high-quality skin is for example the [[Black Bengal goat|Black Bengal]] breed, native to [[Bangladesh]].

In 1974, there was controversy in the [[United States]] surrounding goatskin products originating in [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml74/74026.html |title=Goatskin Products from Haiti Anthrax Warning |publisher=Cpsc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109000405/https://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml74/74026.html |archivedate=2013-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]] discovered that some of these products contained deadly [[anthrax]] spores. All Haitian goatskin products in the USA were recalled, although no fatalities were reported.

'''Henry Hamilton Love''' (December 27, 1875 &amp;ndash; May 2, 1922) was a [[Nashville, TN|Nashville]] [[lumberman]] and sportswriter. Known as the "Daddy of the Nashville lumberman," he was the first president of the Nashville Lumberman's Club.  He wrote the ''Hardwood Code'', a [[Telegraphy|telegraphic]] code then used extensively in the trade, and urged by the Hardwood Manufacturer's Association of the United States.

He was also chair of the Nashville board of censorship of [[Film|moving pictures]], and active in the [[Rotary Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA275#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Dual Membership|pages=252; 275|author=Hamilton Love|journal=The Rotarian|date=December 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Hamilton Love was born on December 27, 1875 on his father's farm about three miles from Nashville, Tennessee,&lt;ref name=volunteer/&gt; the youngest child of James Benton Love and Mary Elizabeth Plummer, named for his grandfather. Love's father James was a [[coal]] merchant, a member of the firm of Love &amp; Randle.&lt;ref name=hardrec&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wQ3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|volume=32|title=Builders of Lumber History: Hamilton Love|journal=Hardwood Record|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother's father James Ransom Plummer was the mayor of [[Columbia, Tennessee]] in 1832, 1833, 1834, 1836, and 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dQBAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Century Review, 1805-1905, Maury County, Tennessee...|first=David Peter|last=Robbins|date=17 November 2018|publisher=Board of mayor &amp; aldermen|page=44|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Love was thus a descendant of [[James Ransom (Regulator)|James Ransom]], and a relative of [[Nathaniel Macon]] and [[Kemp P. Battle|Kemp Plummer Battle]]. His father's grandmother was a Gannaway, making him also a relative of [[William Gannaway Brownlow]] and [[William Trigg Gannaway]].

==News reporter==
Love left school at the age of fifteen and worked as a reporter and [[newswriter]] for the ''Nashville Evening Herald''. He then got a job writing for the Sunday Times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16043588/the_tennessean/|work=The Daily American|title=Personal|page=4|date=March 20, 1892|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=July 2, 2018}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later wrote for the ''Nashville American''.&lt;ref name=hardrec/&gt;

Love contributed articles on sports in the [[American South|South]] to ''[[The Sporting News]]'' and ''[[Sporting Life (American newspaper)|Sporting Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Sporting Life|page=16|date=October 10, 1908|url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/SportingLife/1908/VOL_52_NO_05/SL5205016.pdf|title=South Sayings|author=Hamilton Love|volume=52|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|asin=0786430508|title=The Greatest Game Ever Played In Dixie|author= John A.

On the 1908 team winning the Southern pennant after [[1908 Nashville vs. New Orleans baseball game|defeating New Orleans]], Love wrote "By one run, by one point, Nashville has won the Southern League pennant, nosing New Orleans out literally by an [[eyelash]]. Saturday's game, which was the deciding one, between Nashville and New Orleans was the greatest exhibition of the national game ever seen in the south and the finish in the league race probably sets a record in baseball history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=South Sayings|journal=Sporting Life|page=16|date=October 10, 1908|author=Hamilton Love|url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/SportingLife/1908/VOL_52_NO_05/SL5205016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
On November 30, 1901 Love married Bessie May Davis.&lt;ref name=volunteer/&gt; Her father Leonard Fite Davis was a relative of [[Monthaven|Leonard B.

He had two sons, Henry Hamilton Love, Jr. and Robert Hamilton Love. Both were seamen. "Ham" Jr. attended the [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]] and married Louise McAlister, the daughter of governor [[Hill McAlister]]. He was a business man in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1QTAAAAYAAJ&amp;g&amp;ved|year=1952|author=Junius Elmore Dovell|title=Florida: Historic, Dramatic, Contemporary|volume=3|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hammer-headed tenon''' joints are one method that can be used to join curved members of [[Woodworking joints|joinery]] components.

'''The hammer-headed tenon''' is used to join a curved member to a straight member such as a curved head member to a jamb. The [[Mortise and tenon|tenon]] is formed on the jamb and the mortise to receive the tenon is formed on the curved member. The mortise is increased in size to receive a pair of folding [[Wedge (mechanical device)|wedges]] each side of the tenon.

'''The hammer-headed key''' is used where there is no straight member to form the tenon. It is difficult to form a strong tenon on curved cut timber as the short [[Wood grain|grain]] there will weaken it, so two mortise sockets are formed one in each piece and a separate tenon piece called a key is formed to fit. As with the hammer-headed tenon the mortise sockets are increased in size to allow for the folding wedges each side of the tenon.

When the joint is fitted and glued together it is the folding wedges that give the [[Clamp (tool)|cramping]] effect that tightens the shoulder of the joint.

Both these hammer-headed joints need good attention to detail from the [[joiner]] as they are difficult to make completely by machine or power tool.

Other joints that can be used on curved headed frames are:&lt;br /&gt;
Draw dowelled bridle or mortise&lt;br /&gt;
Handrail bolts and dowels

The '''Richard L. Hearn Generating Station''' (named after [[Richard Hearn|Richard Lankaster Hearn]]) is a decommissioned electrical generating station in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. The plant was originally fired by [[coal]], but later converted to burn [[oil]]. It was never converted to run natural gas, rather it was replaced by a newer much smaller natural gas plant. It is still owned by [[Ontario Power Generation]], a publicly owned electrical generation company.{{R|"NationalPost1"}} The plant has been described as "Pharaonic in scale",{{R|"TorontoStar1"}} and encompasses {{nowrap|650 thousand}} cubic metres&lt;!--TorontoStar1: 23e6 ft^3--&gt; of space{{R|"TorontoStar1"}}—large enough to fit 12 [[Parthenon]]s inside.{{R|"NationalPost1"}}

The plant is located at 440 [[Unwin Avenue]] in [[Port Lands, Toronto|Toronto's Port Lands]] area, directly south of the foot of Carlaw Avenue, across the shipping channel and next to the recently opened [[Portlands Energy Centre]]. The Richard L. Hearn Generating Station, together with the nearby [[Ashbridges Bay Wastewater Treatment Plant]] sewage sludge incinerator stack and the Commissioners Street waste incinerator stack, stand as towering landmarks of a bygone industrial era in the Portlands area of Toronto (all three facilities are no longer in operation, but their towering smokestacks still stand). The property has been leased to Studios of America since 2002.&lt;ref name="thestar.com"&gt;https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2017/10/12/provinces-waterfront-hearn-site-subject-of-sales-talks.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The R. L. Hearn Generating Station was the site of Canada's first {{nowrap|100 MW}} steam turbo-generator set. The station sits in what was once [[Ashbridge's Bay]], a shallow marsh that was filled in with rubble from downtown construction sites from 1911 to 1950s. The station was officially opened on October 26, 1951 by [[Leslie Frost]], Premier of Ontario, with the first two units in service. Four units were in operation by 1953. The plant originally burned [[coal]] which was transported on ships through the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]. The station was designed by [[Stone &amp; Webster]]. The [[turbine]] generators were built by Parsons in England and the boilers were made in Canada by [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] (Cambridge, Ontario) and [[Combustion Engineering]] (Montreal, Quebec).

Construction on the station was not even finished in the 1950s when Hydro officials and the government began to talk about phasing out the plant with nuclear power and closing it. The early years were marked by difficult labour relations and several near strikes. Several unions were involved in conflicts with management and each other during the life of the station. The R. L. Hearn station was one of the founding locals of the [[Canadian Union of Operating Engineers and General Workers]] (CUOE Local 100) in 1960.

===Operation as a coal-fired plant===

Some indication of the power generated by the turbines can be seen in the size of the power shaft.]]
The Richard L. Hearn plant reached full capacity of {{gaps|1|200 MW}} for the first time on March 22, 1961. At full load the boilers burned about 400 tonnes of coal per hour, and the turbines and other equipment required about {{nowrap|36 million}} gallons of cooling water from Lake Ontario per hour. Total construction cost was {{nowrap|{{CA$|156 million|link=yes}}}}. The turbine hall was almost 300 metres long and was an impressive sight, viewed from the visitor gallery on the west side of the plant where the offices were located. Units 1–4 {{nowrap|(100 MW)}} had one turbine-generator each. The {{nowrap|200 MW}} units (5–8) had two turbine-generators per unit—an arrangement called tandem cross-compound—so there were a total of 12 turbine-generator sets in the turbine hall. At the peak of the R. L. Hearn's operation in the 1960s the station employed up to 600 people. Many [[Ontario Hydro]] (later Ontario Power Generation) operators, maintainers, technicians and professionals began their careers, and were trained at the station and then went on to work at other plants and Ontario's [[CANDU]] nuclear stations.

The station at first had four smaller chimneys, one for each of the four boilers. The construction of the four {{nowrap|200 MW}} units added four more chimneys. The last three were a bit taller than the first five. The eight short chimneys were a source of [[air pollution]] in local neighborhoods and downtown Toronto and also [[fly ash]] and other particulates. The station contributed to Toronto's smog problem.

The eight chimneys were demolished and electrostatic precipitators were added for the {{nowrap|200 MW}} units when the large smokestack was built. The new single tall smokestack was built in response to pressure to reduce smog in Toronto by the emerging environmental movement in the late 1960s. It stands 215 metres&lt;!--Emporis1: 215.00 m--&gt; tall{{R|"Emporis1"}} and was one of the tallest in the world, costing {{nowrap|$9 million}} when it was completed in 1971.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;https://archive.org/stream/CONTROLLINGAIRPO00SNSN09365.ome/CONTROLLINGAIRPO00SNSN09365_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; Air pollution in Toronto from the station was greatly reduced and the area around the plant became known as a good fishing and recreation spot.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Conversion to natural gas===
By the end of 1971,&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt; the entire plant was converted to burn natural gas with four units retaining the option to burn coal. In December 1972, [[Alberta]] Premier [[Peter Lougheed]] called the billion cubic metres of Alberta natural gas the station was burning annually "an appalling waste of natural gas" at the price of about $0.035 per cubic metre, and he charged that Ontario was getting a "cheap ride" at Alberta's expense.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The station operated burning natural gas until the early 1980s {{when|date=June 2014}}and units 1–5 were mothballed between 1978–1979. Conversion to natural gas reduced pollution but increased operating costs and the plant's efficiency was much lower than today's [[combined cycle]] and [[cogeneration]] plants. The last three {{nowrap|200 MW}} units at the plant resumed burning coal along with natural gas but they were phased out of operation in July 1983, due to concerns about increased air pollution in Toronto and an abundant energy supply in the province. The staff level had been reduced to around 180 when power production stopped in 1983. Many of the workers took early retirement and others were transferred to other sites. Some of the generators were operated as [[synchronous condenser]]s to improve power quality in Toronto and the electrical control room and switchyard continued to operate until 1995, with a staff of about 10.

In October 1985, Premier [[David Peterson]]'s Liberal government proposed the re-opening the station using natural gas. It was only the first of numerous proposals to restart the plant, involving [[cogeneration]], tri-generation, garbage incineration
and eventually [[gas turbine]] [[combined cycle]] plants as new technologies were developed.

In June 1987, Ontario [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative Party]] (PC) energy critic [[Philip Andrewes]] pushed the governing [[Liberal Party of Ontario|Liberal]] government to have the Hearn re-opened as a "non-polluting" natural gas power plant.{{R|"OntarioLegislature1"|"OntarioLegislature2"}}{{#tag:ref|Andrewes also alleged that the government's alternative proposal would be "more expensive and environmentally harmful" than restarting electricity production at the Hearn plant.{{R|"OntarioLegislature1"}}|group="Note"}} In October 1988, PC member of provincial parliament [[Donald Cousens]] called for the addition of [[scrubber]]s to the Hearn and proposed to return the station to service.{{R|"OntarioLegislature3"}}

On March 16, 1990, Ontario Hydro announced the restart of two units (7 &amp; 8) to meet demand for the winter of 1991. The restart had a projected cost of {{nowrap|$69 million}}. Work on the restart was well underway when the new [[Ontario New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] government of Premier [[Bob Rae]] cancelled the project.

===Redevelopment plans===
The site was designated as protected for future electricity development by the [[Mike Harris]]- and [[Ernie Eves]]-led Ontario Progressive Conservative Party. This was also done with all other existing publicly owned electrical generating stations during the [[deregulation]] of the Ontario electrical power system. The plant had all of the [[asbestos]] insulation removed and site remediation work was done in the 1990s. Former premier [[Mike Harris]] later mentioned his plans to build the [[Portlands Energy Centre]] on the site of the Hearn,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} but the actual plant, opened in 2008 sits next to Hearn.

In 2002, Ontario Power Generation announced that Studios of America and [[Comweb Group]] (headed by [[Paul Bronfman]]) would be leasing the property of the former generating station and had plans to construct a {{nowrap|28 thousand}} square metre multipurpose film production studio called Great Lakes Studios on the site. Most of the boilers and a large amount of other equipment were removed and sent to the scrapyard. This movie studio project was abandoned in 2006. Although the station did not become a movie studio, the R. L. Hearn interior and grounds were used in a number of movie productions over the years. {{As of|2010}}, Studios of America still has long term lease obligations for the Hearn site (32.5 years, according to the City of Toronto’s Waterfront Secretariat, or 20 years, according to Studios of America).{{R|"NationalPost1"}} Subsequent reports indicated that the lease-holders are Paul Vaughan of Studios America and real estate developer Mario Cortellucci, with no reference to Comweb Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/what-should-toronto-do-with-the-hearn-power-generating-station-1.2700010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ontario government announced in April 2005 that the Portlands Energy Centre would not be part of the approved {{gaps|2|500 MW}} of new power production in Ontario coming online in the next few years. The Independent Electricity System Operator warned of rolling black-outs in Toronto if {{nowrap|250 MW}} are not added by 2008, with an additional {{nowrap|250 MW}} required by 2010. However, in February 2006 this decision was reversed, a new plan emerged proposing a new plant be built next to the Hearn site. Toronto mayor [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] lobbied to have Hearn restored in some capacity to provide that power rather than build a second plant, while nearby residents opposed any kind of power generation plant in the area.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

A proposal was made by [[Enwave]] (the former Toronto District Heating Corporation) and [[Constellation Energy]] to install advanced gas turbines and cogeneration inside the station and restore the station's control rooms, turbine hall and building exterior as a historical, filmmaking and education centre. The Minister of Energy, [[Donna Cansfield]] rejected the proposal.

On September 18, 2006 an agreement was signed between the Provincial government, Ontario Power Generation and [[TransCanada Corp.]] to construct a gas-fired plant next to Hearn. The Portlands plant may eventually be co-generation, however it is being built as a combined cycle plant due to inability to negotiate contracts for cogeneration energy sales. The [[Portlands Energy Centre]] opened in June 2008 with simple cycle production and combined cycle operation scheduled for mid-2009. Extensive demolition of previously preserved areas of the station including the turbine hall began once Studios of America abandoned their plans for a film studio.

In 2006, proposal to build a {{nowrap|$600 million}} transmission corridor from the Portlands plant to connect with higher voltage transmission lines north of Toronto was being discussed and opposed by resident and other groups. The transmission system that the R.L Hearn station supplied was a {{nowrap|115 kV}} network of buried and overhead lines and transformer stations in Toronto. The city has been supplied by stepdown transformer stations from the east and west since the R. L. Hearn closed, which are becoming overloaded, especially in the summer.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

On June 21, 2010, architecture firm [[Behnisch Architekten]] presented a proposal for converting the Hearn site into a three-pad arena.{{R|"NationalPost1"}} This plan did not proceed. The facility remains in the hands of the lease-holders with options that include  extensions lasting until 2041. The property is not suitable for residential development because it is too close to the Portlands natural gas generating plant.&lt;ref name="thestar.com"/&gt;

===Other uses===
The nearly abandoned plant attracted photographers and "[[urban explorer]]s" who published their work on websites and in photography exhibits in recent years. On June 15, 2008, Ryan Nyenhuis, an urban explorer trespassing in the plant fell three storeys into a coal chute, and was trapped for three hours when he became pinned under a steel plate.{{R|"CityTV1"|"CityTV2"}} He suffered serious injuries and died two days later in hospital.{{R|"CityTV2"}}

During the 1990s the Hearn Generating Station doubled a filming location in many Canadian television productions, including [[Goosebumps (TV series)]] (it served as the iconic Dark Falls Chemical Factory on the Season 2 episode ''Welcome to Dead House''), [[Once a Thief (TV series)]] and [[Animorphs (TV series)]]. It was usually used to substitute as an industrial factory because of its basic industrial appearance and its iconic tall smokestack. This trend began to die down in the early 2000s but the generating station still appears on TV from time to time, most recently in [[12 Monkeys (TV series)|12 Monkeys]] from 2015-2018 as Raritan Valley National Laboratory, the home of a time machine in a post apocalyptic world.

In 2010, the station was used as the backdrop for the climactic scene of the movie [[Red (2010 film)|RED]], other scenes of which were shot in the Toronto area as well.

On June 5, 2014, the building was used for the Toronto Luminato Festival Big Bang Bash, their 2nd annual fundraising gala. It also featured the Yves Saint Laurent Opening Night Party later that evening.{{R|"Luminato1"}}

In 2015 the building was used for UNSOUND hosted by Luminato Festival.

From June 9–26, 2016 Luminato Festival used the building for its festival hub.

===Advanced Composition Explorer===

The [[Advanced Composition Explorer]] (ACE) observes and measures the composition of particles from the solar wind as well as galactic cosmic rays. Its prime objective is to improve measurements of the composition of diverse samples of matter associated with the sun, the interstellar medium, and the galaxy surrounding us. ACE is capable of providing near-real-time solar wind and magnetic field information that aids in forecasting space weather. Advance knowledge of solar wind disturbances heading toward Earth&amp;nbsp;– of about half an hour&amp;nbsp;– can help mitigate the effects of geomagnetic storms that can overload power grids and disrupt communications on Earth.&lt;ref name=ACE&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Science Missions: ACE|url=http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/ace/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ARTEMIS===

The [[THEMIS#ARTEMIS|ARTEMIS]], or Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon’s Interaction with the Sun, mission studies the moon's space environment, surface composition and magnetic field, and core structure. ARTEMIS uses two spacecraft from the THEMIS magnetosphere mission that were moved into place near the moon.&lt;ref name=THEMIS&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA THEMIS Mission Site|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/main/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BARREL===

This division is also involved in the Balloon Array for Radiation-belt Relativistic Electron Losses ([[BARREL]]) study. Twenty balloons were launched during a January 2013 campaign in Antarctica to study a space weather phenomenon, during which electrons stream down toward the poles from the two [[Van Allen Belts]], which surround Earth. It is a NASA-funded mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/rbsp/barrel/20balloons.html NASA’s BARREL Mission]. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===CINDI===

The Coupled Ion-Neutral Dynamics Investigations ([[CINDI]]) is a project to understand the dynamics of Earth's ionosphere. CINDI provides two instruments for the Communication/Navigation Outage Forecast System (C/NOFS) satellite, which is a United States Air Force project. CINDI helps predict the behavior of equatorial ionospheric irregularities, which can cause major problems for communications and navigation systems.&lt;ref name=CINDI&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA-CINDI|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cindi/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cluster===

[[Cluster II (spacecraft)|Cluster]] is a joint ESA/NASA mission that provides in-situ investigation of plasma processes in Earth's magnetosphere using four identical spacecraft. The four spacecraft make it possible to better observe three-dimensional and time-varying phenomena, as well as to distinguish between the two as it moves through space in its orbit around Earth.&lt;ref name=Cluster&gt;{{cite web|title=Missions – Cluster II – NASA science|url=http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/cluster/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geotail===
[[Geotail]] is a joint JAXA/NASA mission. Its primary objective is to study the dynamics of the entire length of Earth's magnetotail, from the near-Earth region to the distant tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missions – Geotail – NASA Science|url=http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/geotail/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph===

Engaging in solar and heliospheric science, the [[Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph]] (IRIS) mission is intended to study of the [[sun|solar atmosphere]],  and in particular, of the interface between the [[photosphere]] and [[corona]].  The IRIS mission will accomplish this by tracing the flow of energy and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] through the [[chromosphere]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]] into the [[corona]] using [[Rutherford backscattering spectrometry|spectrometry]] and imaging. IRIS is designed to provide significant new information to increase the understanding of [[Solar transition region|energy transport]] into the corona and [[solar wind]] and provide an archetype for all stellar [[atmosphere]]s. The unique instrument capabilities, coupled with state of the art 3-D modeling, will fill a large gap in our knowledge of this dynamic region of the solar atmosphere. The mission will extend the scientific output of existing heliophysics spacecraft that follow the effects of energy release processes from the sun to Earth. The IRIS mission launched June 27, 2013.&lt;ref name=research/&gt;&lt;ref name=IRISLaunch&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA: IRIS Launch Updates|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/iris/launch/index.html|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iris&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstellar Boundary Explorer===

The [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer]], or IBEX, images the outer boundaries of the heliosphere, focusing on how the solar wind interacts with the interstellar medium and its magnetic fields at the very edges of our Solar System. IBEX maps the region by measuring the energetic neutral atoms that are created near the boundary, creating a new map every six months. After completing and analyzing the first maps, IBEX now monitors changes that correspond to variations in solar activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Missions – IBEX|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ibex/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager===
The [[Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager]], or RHESSI, combines high-resolution imaging in hard X-rays and gamma rays with high-resolution spectroscopy to explore the basic physics of particle acceleration and energy release in solar flares. Such information improves our understanding of the fundamental processes that are involved in generating solar flares and coronal mass ejections. These super-energetic solar eruptive events are the most extreme drivers of space weather and present significant dangers in space and on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missions -- RHESII -- NASA Science|url=http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/rhessi/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar Dynamics Observatory===

NASA’s [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (SDO) mission was launched in 2010 and is currently studying solar activity and how it causes [[space weather]]. Space weather affects not only our lives on Earth, but Earth itself, and everything outside its atmosphere ([[astronaut]]s and [[satellite]]s out in space and even the other [[planet]]s). SDO is helping us understand where the sun's energy comes from, how the inside of the sun works, and how energy is stored and released in the sun's atmosphere. By better understanding the sun and how it works, we will be able to better predict and better forecast space weather events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/releases/2013/13-002.html Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission]. NASA.
2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar and Heliospheric Observatory===

A joint ESA/NASA mission, the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]], or SOHO, studies the sun, from deep inside its core to the outer corona and solar wind. SOHO has been capturing images of the dynamic flares and coronal mass ejections on the sun since 1996. The mission has provided an unprecedented breadth and depth of information about the sun, with a unique combination of instruments that study its interior through the hot and dynamic atmosphere to the solar wind and its interaction with the interstellar medium. Its coronagraphs&amp;nbsp;– images that observe the sun's atmosphere by blocking out the bright sun in the middle&amp;nbsp;– remain a key component for forecasting the speed, direction and strength of coronal mass ejections as they erupt from the sun. In addition to watching the sun, SOHO has become the most prolific discoverer of comets in astronomical history: as of 2012, over 2000 comets have been found by SOHO.&lt;ref name=SOHO&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA – SOHO|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/soho/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===STEREO===

The Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or [[STEREO]], mission employs two nearly identical space-based observatories to provide the stereoscopic measurements to study the sun. With a pair of viewpoints, scientists are able to see the structure and evolution of solar storms as they blast from the sun and travel out through space. STEREO's instruments provide a unique combination of observations to help understand the causes and mechanisms of coronal mass ejections and to characterize how they propagate through the Solar System. STEREO also helps determine what powers the acceleration of energetic particles from the sun and provides information on the structure of the solar wind.&lt;ref name=STEREO&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA – STEREO|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/main/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===THEMIS===

[[THEMIS]] answers fundamental questions concerning a type of space weather called a substorm that can abruptly and explosively release solar wind energy stored within Earth’s magnetotail. Substorms cause auroras at high latitudes, and THEMIS seeks to understand this process. Originally five spacecraft, THEMIS now consists of three, as two were repurposed to study the moon in the [[ARTEMIS]] mission. The mission also relies on a dedicated array of ground observatories located in Canada and the northern United States.&lt;ref name=THEMIS /&gt;

===TIMED===

The Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics, or [[TIMED]], mission  explores Earth's mesosphere and lower thermosphere (40–50 miles up), the least explored and understood region of the atmosphere. Solar events, as well as temperature changes in the stratosphere can perturb this region, but the overall structure of and responses to these effects are not understood. Advances in remote sensing technology employed by TIMED enable it to explore this region on a global basis from space.&lt;ref name=TIMED&gt;{{cite web|title=Missions -- TIMED -- NASA Science|url=http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/timed/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TWINS===

The instruments on the Two Wide-Angle Imaging Neutral-Atom Spectrometers, or [[TWINS]], provide stereo imaging of Earth's magnetosphere—the region surrounding the planet, controlled by Earth’s magnetic field and containing the Van Allen radiation belts and other energetic charged particles. TWINS enables three-dimensional global visualization of this region, leading to greatly enhanced understanding of the connections between different areas of the magnetosphere and their relation to the solar wind.&lt;ref name=TWINS&gt;{{cite web|title=Missions -- TWINS A &amp; B -- NASA science|url=http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/twins/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Van Allen Probes===

The [[Van Allen Probes]] consist of twin spacecraft studying the extreme and dynamic regions of space known as the Van Allen Radiation Belts that surround Earth. The radiation belts intensify or weaken over time as part of the much larger space weather system driven by the energy and material that erupt off the sun's surface and fill the entire Solar System.&lt;ref name=VAP&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA – Van Allen Probes|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/rbsp/main/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voyager mission===

The [[Voyager spacecraft|Voyager mission]]s ([[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]]) are a part of NASA's [[Heliophysics System Observatory]], sponsored by the Heliophysics Division of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. The Voyager spacecraft were built and continue to be operated by NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], in Pasadena, Calif. On December 4, 2012,  [[1,000,000,000|eleven billion]] miles from Earth, NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft has entered a "magnetic highway" that connects our [[Solar System]] to [[interstellar space]]. The "magnetic highway" is a place in the far reaches of the Solar System where the sun's magnetic field connects to the magnetic field of interstellar space. In this region, the sun's magnetic field lines are connected to interstellar magnetic field lines, allowing particles from inside the heliosphere to zip away and particles from interstellar space to zoom in. In recent years, the speed of the solar wind around Voyager 1 has slowed to zero, and the intensity of the magnetic field has increased.&lt;ref name= voy1&gt;This content is in the Public Domain on NASA's website.

The '''Hybrid Scorecard''' was created by the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS) to give consumers a comprehensive comparison of [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s available in the U.S. market. The UCS Hybrid Scorecard ratings take into considerations [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] as rated by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA); the environmental benefits as compared to its similar or closest conventional [[internal combustion engine]] counterpart; how cost-effectively a particular hybrid achieves its environmental performance; and premium features that are bundled on a hybrid as standard equipment raising its purchase price.&lt;ref name=GCC0110/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCSMethod/&gt;

The Hybrid Scorecard is available to the public through the Hybridcenter.org website, created in 2005 by the Union of Concerned Scientists to provide consumer and technology information about hybrid vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2005/05/ucs_launches_tw.html|title=UCS Launches Two Consumer Sites on Hybrids|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=May 4, 2005|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first scorecard was published in January 2010, for 2009–10 [[model year]] hybrids.&lt;ref name=GCC0110/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABF0210/&gt; The 2011 Hybrid Scorecard was published in July 2011, and evaluated 34 hybrids from the 2011–12 model years available in the U.S.&lt;ref name=NYT0711/&gt;

The scorecard was retired in 2013 and was replaced in 2015 with an [http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/ev-emissions-tool online tool] that calculates electric vehicle emissions.

==Variables==
All hybrid vehicles are grouped into two broad categories, non-luxury and luxury models, and the Hybrid Scorecard score for each [[hybrid electric vehicle]] available in the U.S. market is assessed considering the following four variables: combined miles per gallon, environmental improvement score, hybrid value, and forced features.

===Combined miles per gallon===
This category considers the combined [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] rating for highway/city as estimated by the U.S. EPA and expressed in miles per gallon.&lt;ref name=UCSMethod&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridcenter.org/hybrid-scorecard/hybrid-scorecard-methodology.html |title=UCS Hybrid Scorecard Methodology |author=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] |publisher=HybridCenter.org |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810225519/http://www.hybridcenter.org/hybrid-scorecard/hybrid-scorecard-methodology.html |archivedate=August 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Improvement Score===
This category measures the [[smog]]-forming and [[greenhouse gas emissions|global warming pollution]] performance of a hybrid against its similar or closest conventional gasoline counterpart, and thus, it does not reflect the vehicle’s overall greenhouse gas emissions performance relative to the average vehicle.

;Global warming emissions reduction
The greenhouse gas emission reductions are calculated as a percent reduction based on the combined city/highway fuel economy ratings for both the hybrid and non-hybrid model according to the ratings published in EPA's fuel economy guide available online at www.fueleconomy.gov. The score is measured in a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 is the best rating. The scores are assigned in relative terms, then a 10 is assigned to the hybrid with the largest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, while a zero is assigned to the hybrid with the smallest reduction. The values assigned to the models are calculated through linear interpolation between the two end points. For purposes of updating the scorecard, if new hybrid models are introduced during the year, the scale has to be re-calculated to take account of the new arrivals. For the 2011 Scorecard, the [[Lincoln MKZ Hybrid]] was rated a 10 while the [[Volkswagen Touareg#Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid (2009)|Volkswagen Touareg Hybrid]] was rated 0. The [[Toyota Prius]] was rated a 9.4.&lt;ref name=UCSMethod/&gt;

;Particulates and Smog-forming Emissions
[[Motor vehicle emissions|Tailpipe emissions]] are considered through EPA’s air pollution score for each hybrid vehicle and not relatively to the improvement over the similar conventional model. Even though EPA rates air pollution scores for both California and federal standards, the Hybrid Scorecard ratings use only the California emissions certification level in order to introduce the maximum potential to reduce tailpipe emissions .  The score is measured in a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 is the best rating and 0 is the worst. Then, using the legal definitions established by the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB), a [[zero emissions vehicle]] (ZEV) is assigned a 10, a [[partial zero emissions vehicle]] (PZEV) a 9, a [[super ultra low emission vehicle]] (SULEV II) an 8, and so forth.&lt;ref name=UCSMethod/&gt;

;Combined Environmental Improvement Score
The final Environmental Improvement Score is determined through the average (and rounded to the nearest tenth) of the values for global warming emissions reductions and tailpipe emissions. As an example, the 2011 [[Lincoln MKZ Hybrid]] achieved a 46% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with its sibling gasoline-only model. Because this is the largest percent reduction achieved among all hybrids the MKZ Hybrid earns a global warming emissions score of 10. As a California certified Partial Zero Emission Vehicle, the MKZ Hybrid earns an EPA air pollution score of 9.0. When both scores are combined, the MKZ Hybrid earns an overall Environmental Improvement Score of 9.5.&lt;ref name=UCSMethod/&gt;

===Hybrid value===
This category measures how cost-effectively a particular hybrid achieves its environmental performance, and the scores vary from "Very Poor" to "Superior." Each hybrid model is evaluated by dividing the estimated cost of hybrid technology used in the vehicle by its reduction in global warming emissions over the conventional model expressed as a percentage. The ratings are assigned to each model based on the resulting incremental cost according to the range values shown in the table in the right. When a hybrid achieves a better smog certification level than its conventional counterpart, the hybrid technology cost should include the cost of any additional emissions controls used in the hybrid model.&lt;ref name=UCSMethod/&gt;

===Forced features===
This category measures how many premium or upgraded features, called forced features, are included on a hybrid model as standard equipment in comparison to its sibling conventional model. UCS considers that these forced features make it less economical for consumers to buy a base hybrid model. UCS calculates the cost of forced features as the difference in [[manufacturer's suggested retail price|MSRP]] between the base conventional model, with no upgrades, and the base hybrid model, and then the estimated cost of the hybrid technology is subtracted. This category is scored quantitatively from None to $$$$$. Vehicles with no forced features are assigned a rating of “None” meaning that the additional costs for the vehicle only cover the cost of the hybrid system. Vehicles that have {{USD|6,000}} or more of forced features are assigned the maximum of “$$$$$.” The other scores are defined in intermediate ranges of {{USD|1,500}}.&lt;ref name=UCSMethod/&gt;

==2010 Scorecard==
The U.C.S. evaluated 31 hybrids from the 2009–10 model years for the 2010 Hybrid Scorecard.&lt;ref name=GCC0110&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/01/ucs-20100128.html|title=UCS "Hybrid ScoreCard" Dings Automakers for Forced Features in Hybrid Offerings|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=January 28, 2010|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 [[Toyota Prius#Third generation (ZVW30; 2009–present)|Toyota Prius]] scored top marks in the categories regarding environmental benefit and hybrid value. The UCS found that, compared to its closest conventional counterpart the [[Toyota Matrix]], the Prius emits 44% less [[greenhouse gas|global warming pollution]].  The Prius score on forced features was rated relatively good, as the car came with {{USD|1,600}} worth of forced features.&lt;ref name=GCC0110/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABF0210&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2010/02/01/union-of-concerned-scientists-criticizes-hybrids-for-bundling-to/|title=

==2011 Scorecard==

The 2011 Hybrid Scorecard evaluated 34 hybrids from the 2011–12 model years sold as of April 2011.&lt;ref name=UCSMethod/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT0711&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/scientists-demand-improved-hybrid-performance-from-automakers/?emc=eta1|title=Scientists Demand Improved Hybrid Performance From Automakers|author=Cheryl Jensen|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 evaluation found that only 13 of the 34 hybrids available in the U.S. market reduce more than 25% of [[greenhouse emissions]] compared with their gasoline engine counterparts, but the 2011 scorecard now includes more top performers than it did in 2010.&lt;ref name=NYT0711/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCS2011PR/&gt;
 [[File:2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid with badging WAS 2011 855.jpg|thumb|The [[Lincoln MKZ Hybrid]] ranked in the top of the luxury models in the 2011 Hybrid Scorecard.]]
The [[Toyota Prius#Third generation (ZVW30; 2009–present)|Toyota Prius]] remained the top nonluxury model in the environmental improvement category by emitting 40% less greenhouse emissions than comparable nonhybrid models. In the luxury category, two new additions, the [[Lincoln MKZ Hybrid]] and the [[Lexus CT200h]] accomplished similar performance, an achievement the UCS attributed to their relatively small gasoline engines, as the carmakers downsized these vehicles’ engines from six to four cylinders to maximize fuel economy.&lt;ref name=NYT0711/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCS2011PR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/hybrid-scorecard-2011-6214.html |title=Hybrid Scorecard for 2011 Shows Automakers Not Delivering Enough 'High Value' Models |publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] |date=July 6, 2011 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721020806/http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/hybrid-scorecard-2011-6214.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The evaluation found that the MKZ Hybrid reduces greenhouse emissions by 46.2% as compared to its sibling gasoline-only MKZ, and the Lexus CT200h a 42.9% reduction.&lt;ref name=UCSMethod/&gt;

Besides the Prius, the 2011 evaluation found that more automakers are using hybrid technology to increase fuel efficiency and decrease tailpipe emissions without imposing significant price premiums for those benefits, and other hybrids scoring high on environmental improvement include the [[Ford Fusion Hybrid]], [[Honda Civic Hybrid]], and [[Toyota Highlander Hybrid]]. In the non-luxury category, the worst offender is the [[Volkswagen Touareg#Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid (2009)|Volkswagen Touareg Hybrid]], which reduces less than a 10% of greenhouse emissions, an all-time low on the scorecard. According to the UCS, the ''"Touareg was singled out as an example of a "muscle" hybrid that emphasized power over fuel efficiency."'' The UCS also singled out among the worst-rated hybrids for environmental improvement the new [[Porsche Cayenne#Hybrid|Porshe Cayenne S Hybrid]], the  [[ActiveHybrid 7|BMW Active Hybrid 750i]], and the [[BMW X6#ActiveHybrid X6 (2009–)|ActiveHybrid X6]].&lt;ref name=NYT0711/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/toyota/prius/toyota-prius-shines-volkswagen-touareg-stumbles-in-2011-hybrid-scorecard.html|title=Toyota Prius Shines, Volkswagen Touareg Stumbles in 2011 Hybrid Scorecard|author=Anita Lienert |publisher=[[Edmunds.com]]|date=July 8, 2011|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UCS explained that the [[Chevrolet Volt]] [[plug-in hybrid]] (PHEV) was not included in the evaluation even though the Volt could have been compared with the [[Chevrolet Cruze]] as the conventional similar. The reason for the exclusion is that PHEVs are affected by a variety of factors that affect their environmental performance, such as the type of fuel used (coal, wind, solar, etc.) for generating electricity to charge the vehicle, and also by the driving habits, including how often the vehicle is plugged in and the number of miles driven on electricity-only mode.&lt;ref name=UCSMethod/&gt;

'''Internal Market in Electricity Directive''' is the Directive 2003/54/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC is based in the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 47(2), Article 55 and Article 95 thereof. '''Note:''' The Directive 2003/54/EC has been replaced by the Directive 2009/72/EC.

Directive 96/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 1996 concerning common
rules for the internal market in electricity, has made significant contributions towards the creation of an
internal market for electricity.  Experience in implementing this Directive shows the benefits that may result from the internal market in electricity, in terms of [[electry efficiency|efficiency]] gains, price reductions, higher standards of service and increased [[competitiveness]].

However, important shortcomings and possibilities for improving the functioning of the market remained with the 96/92/EC directive, notably concrete provisions were needed to ensure a [[level playing field]] in [[generation]] and to reduce the risks of [[market dominance]] and [[predatory]] [[behaviour]], ensuring [[non-discriminatory]] [[electricity transmission|transmission]] and [[electricity distribution|distribution]] tariffs, through [[access to the electric network|access to the network]] based on [[third-party access]] rights and on the basis of tariffs published prior to their [[entry into force]], and ensuring that the rights of small and vulnerable customers are protected and that information on energy sources for electricity generation is disclosed, as well as reference to sources, where available, giving information on their [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental impact]].

The freedoms which the Treaty guarantees European citizens – [[free movement of goods]], [[freedom to provide services]] and [[freedom of establishment]] – are only possible in a fully [[open market]], which enables all consumers [[freely to choose their suppliers]] and all suppliers [[freely to deliver to their customers]].

To ensure efficient and non-discriminatory network access, it is appropriate that distribution and transmission systems are operated through legally separate entities where vertically integrated [[Company|undertakings]] exist. Independent management structures must be in place between the distribution system operators, the transmission system operators, and any generation/supply companies.

It is important however to distinguish between such legal separation and [[ownership]] [[unbundling]]. Legal separation does not imply a change of ownership of assets and nothing prevents similar or identical employment conditions applying throughout the whole of the vertically integrated undertakings. However, a non-discriminatory decision-making process should be ensured through organisational measures regarding the independence of the [[decision-maker]]s [[#Moral responsibility|responsible]]. 

To facilitate the conclusion of contracts electricity undertaking established in a Member State the supply of electricity to eligible customers in [[Member State]], Member States and, where appropriate, [[national regulatory authority|national regulatory authorities]] should work towards more homogeneous conditions and the same degree eligibility for the whole of the internal market.

The existence of effective regulation, carried out by one or more national regulatory authorities, is an important factor in guaranteeing non-discriminatory access to the network.

All Community industry and commerce, including small and medium-sized enterprises, and all Community citizens that enjoy the economic benefits of the internal market should also be able to enjoy high levels of [[consumer protection]], and in particular households and, where Member States deem it appropriate, small enterprises should also be able to enjoy [[public services|public service]] [[guarantee]]s, in particular with regard to [[security of supply]] and [[reasonable tariff]]s, for reasons of [[Distributive justice|fairness]], competitiveness and indirectly to create employment.

Electricity customers should be able to choose their supplier freely and ensure they have a real and effective right to [[choose supplier|choose their supplier]].

[[Progressive market opening]] towards full competition should as soon as possible remove differences between
Member States. [[Transparency (humanities)|Transparency]] and [[certainty]] in the implementation of the Directive should be ensured.

[[Image:Recommended fuel mix display format.gif|thumb|200px|A recommended [[Fuel mix disclosure]] display format, proposed in a note annexed to the Directive, EU, 2003 [https://web.archive.org/web/20140220093153/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/electricity/legislation/doc/notes_for_implementation_2004/labelling_en.pdf] ]]Nearly all Member States have chosen to ensure competition in the electricity generation market through a transparent [[authorisation procedure]]. However, Member States should ensure the possibility to contribute to [[security of supply]] through the launching of a [[wikt:tendering|tendering]] procedure or an equivalent procedure in the event that sufficient electricity generation capacity is not built on the basis of the authorisation procedure. Member States should have the possibility, in the interests of [[environmental protection]] and the promotion of [[infant new technology|infant new technologies]], of tendering for new capacity on the basis of published criteria. New capacity includes inter alia [[renewable energy|renewables]] and [[combined heat and power]] (CHP).

The construction and maintenance of the necessary network infrastructure, including [[interconnection]] capacity between areas and [[decentralised electricity generation]], should contribute to ensuring a stable electricity supply.

The Commission has indicated its intention to take initiatives especially as regards the scope of the [[Fuel mix disclosure|labelling provision]] and notably on the manner in which the information on the environmental impact in terms of at least emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the radioactive waste resulting from electricity production from different energy sources, could be made available in a
transparent, easily accessible and comparable manner throughout the European Union and on the manner in which the measures taken in the Member States to control the accuracy of the information provided by suppliers could be [[wikt:streamline|streamline]]d (see no-carbon renewable energy economy – [[Low-carbon economy|NCREE]]).

The respect of the [[public services|public service]] requirements is a fundamental requirement of this Directive, and it is
important that common minimum standards, respected by all Member States, are specified in this Directive.

{{For|the process of creating a true edge on a piece of wood|Edge jointing}}
'''Jointing''' refers to the process of filing or grinding the teeth or knives of cutting tools prior to [[sharpening]]. The purpose of jointing is to ensure that all surfaces to be sharpened are of a consistent size and all imperfections have been removed. 

Jointing is usually the first step in the process of sharpening:

*When sharpening a [[hand saw]] blade, the teeth are jointed by running a flat [[file (tool)|file]] over the tips of the teeth so that they are all of the same height.
*[[Circular saw]] blades are jointed prior to sharpening so that all teeth protrude from the blade the same distance from the centre.
*[[Jointer]] knives are ground until they are all the same length prior to sharpening.
*The edges of a [[card scraper]] are jointed by running the edge over a file or a [[sharpening stone]] prior to turning the burr.

Jointing is usually carried out infrequently as it removes a lot of material from the edge of the blade.

[[Image:Prenzlauer Berg Kopenhagener Straße-001.jpg|thumb|Kopenhagener Straße]]
[[Image:Berlin Prenzlauer Berg Umspannwerk.JPG|thumb|''Humboldt'' transformer station]]
The '''Kopenhagener Straße''' in [[Berlin]]'s [[Prenzlauer Berg]] district runs parallel to the [[Berlin Ringbahn|Ringbahn]] tracks between busy ''[[Berlin Schönhauser Allee railway station|Schönhauser Allee]]'' in the East all the way to the [[Mauerpark]] in the West, where the [[Berlin Wall]] separated the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] from the [[France|French]] sector.  The street was named on 30 April 1899 after the [[Denmark|Danish]] capital [[Copenhagen]].

At a length of 800 metres (1 half mile) it features a nearly complete row of 61 apartment buildings built in the [[Jugendstil]] period with 4 modern houses and playgrounds in between.  From East to West it is intersected by ''Rhinower Straße'', then crossed by ''Sonnenburger Straße'', by ''Ystader Straße'' and finally ends at ''Schwedter Straße'' at the northern end of the Mauerpark.  At ''Sonnenburger Straße'' the ''Schönfließer Brücke'', built in 1908 according to plans by [[Alfred Grenander]], crossed the Ringbahn railway towards the north up until the end of World War II, when it was intentionally detonated to provide a hindrance to the advancing Soviet troops.  Three buildings in the Kopenhagener Straße were destroyed in the process.  As a replacement, a 60&amp;nbsp;m (200&amp;nbsp;ft) long pedestrian bridge was installed right beside during the governance of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (GDR).

A study prepared by the geography department at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] counted 45 different artists in the street, making this one of Berlin's significant creative functional clusters. Further one finds very many cafés, restaurants, bars and the infamous ''Mittwochsclub'' (Wednesday Club, located in the cellar under the ''Kohlenquelle'' Café in No. 16). The most obvious structure in the street is the former ''Humboldt'' transformer station at No. 61 (on the corner of ''Sonnenburger Straße''), that was planned by the renowned German industrial architect [[Hans Heinrich Müller]]. An experimental urban children's farm (the ''Moritzhof'') is located at the western end of the Kopenhagener Straße, providing the surreal view of horses and goats against a backdrop of dense urban housing and the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]].

The Kopenhagener Straße was inhabited by artists and bohémiens much before [[German reunification]]. Despite the renovation and revival of the majority of the buildings since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the [[cobblestone]] street at the northern rim of Berlin's city centre has maintained its pre-unification calm and creative charm.  For this reason the Kopenhagener Straße was selected as the movie set for several movies that indulge in GDR [[Ostalgie]], for example ''Der Rote Kakadu'' and ''Sommer vorm Balkon''. Aside from artists, many actors, authors and architects also have made the street their home or place of work.  Approximately half of the current residents lived in the street before reunification. Newer inhabitants are mostly from former [[West Germany]] and other European countries.

'''LIGA''' is a [[German language|German]] acronym for '''''Li'''thographie, '''G'''alvanoformung, '''A'''bformung'' ([[photolithography|Lithography]], [[Electroplating]], and [[Molding (process)|Molding]]) that describes a fabrication technology used to create high-[[aspect ratio|aspect-ratio]]  microstructures.

==Overview==
The LIGA consists of three main processing steps; lithography, electroplating and molding. 
There are two main LIGA-fabrication technologies, '''X-Ray LIGA''', which uses [[X-ray]]s produced by a [[synchrotron]] to create high-aspect ratio structures, and '''UV LIGA''', a more accessible method which uses [[ultraviolet light]] to create structures with relatively low aspect ratios.

The notable characteristics of X-ray LIGA-fabricated structures include:
* high aspect ratios on the order of 100:1
* parallel side walls with a flank angle on the order of 89.95°
* smooth side walls with [[surface roughness|&lt;math&gt;R_a&lt;/math&gt;]] = {{nowrap|10 nm}}, suitable for optical mirrors
* structural heights from tens of micrometers to several millimeters
* structural details on the order of micrometers over distances of centimeters

===X-Ray LIGA===

X-Ray LIGA is a fabrication process in [[microtechnology]] that was developed in the early 1980s
&lt;ref name=Becker-1982&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Becker, E. W. | last2=Ehrfeld | first2=W. | last3=M&amp;uuml;nchmeyer | first3=D. | last4=Betz | first4=H. | last5=Heuberger | first5=A. | last6=Pongratz | first6=S. | last7=Glashauser | first7=W. | last8=Michel | first8=H.

a team under the leadership of Erwin Willy Becker and Wolfgang Ehrfeld at the Institute for Nuclear Process Engineering
(''Institut für Kernverfahrenstechnik,'' IKVT) at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center, since renamed to the Institute for Microstructure Technology (''Institut für Mikrostrukturtechnik'', IMT) at the ''[[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]]'' (KIT).
LIGA was one of the first major techniques to allow on-demand manufacturing of high-aspect-ratio structures (structures that are much taller than wide) with lateral precision below one micrometer.

In the process, an X-ray sensitive polymer photoresist, typically [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]], bonded to an electrically conductive substrate, is exposed to parallel beams of high-energy X-rays from a synchrotron radiation source through a mask partly covered with a strong X-ray absorbing material. Chemical removal of exposed (or unexposed) photoresist results in a three-dimensional structure, which can be filled by the electrodeposition of metal. The resist is chemically stripped away to produce a metallic mold insert. The mold insert can be used to produce parts in polymers or ceramics through [[injection molding]].

The LIGA technique's unique value is the precision obtained by the use of [[X-ray lithography|deep X-ray lithography]] (DXRL). The technique enables microstructures with high aspect ratios and high precision to be fabricated in a variety of materials (metals, plastics, and ceramics). Many of its practitioners and users are associated with or are located close to synchrotron facilities.

===UV LIGA===

UV LIGA utilizes an inexpensive ultraviolet light source, like a [[mercury lamp]], to expose a polymer photoresist, typically [[SU-8 photoresist|SU-8]].  Because heating and [[transmittance]] are not an issue in optical masks, a simple chromium mask can be substituted for the technically sophisticated X-ray mask.  These reductions in complexity make UV LIGA much cheaper and more accessible than its X-ray counterpart.  However, UV LIGA is not as effective at producing precision molds and is thus used when cost must be kept low and very high aspect ratios are not required.

==Process details==
[[File:LIGA-Process-00.png|thumb|right|The LIGA-fabrication process is composed of exposure (a), development (b), electroforming (c),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electroforming process |url=https://www.vecoprecision.com/technologies/electroforming |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; stripping (d), and replication (e).]]

===Mask===
X-ray masks are composed of a transparent, low-[[Z (Atomic number)|Z]] carrier, a patterned high-[[Z (Atomic number)|Z]] absorber, and a metallic ring for alignment and heat removal.  Due to extreme temperature variations induced by the X-ray exposure, carriers are fabricated from materials with high thermal conductivity to reduce thermal gradients.  Currently, vitreous carbon and graphite are considered the best material, as their use significantly reduces side-wall roughness.  Silicon, silicon nitride, titanium, and diamond are also in use as carrier substrates but not preferred, as the required thin membranes are comparatively fragile and titanium masks tend to round sharp features due to edge fluorescence.  Absorbers are gold, nickel, copper, tin, lead, and other X-ray absorbing metals.

Masks can be fabricated in several fashions.  The most accurate and expensive masks are those created by electron beam lithography, which provides resolutions as fine as {{nowrap|0.1 µm}} in resist {{nowrap|4 µm}} thick and {{nowrap|3 µm}} features in resist {{nowrap|20 µm}} thick.  An intermediate method is the plated photomask which provides {{nowrap|3 µm}} resolution and can be outsourced at a cost on the order of $1000 per mask.  The least expensive method is a direct photomask, which provides {{nowrap|15 µm}} resolution in resist {{nowrap|80 µm}} thick.  In summary, masks can cost between $1000 and $20,000 and take between two weeks and three months for delivery.  Due to the small size of the market, each LIGA group typically has its own mask-making capability.  Future trends in mask creation include larger formats, from a diameter of {{nowrap|100 mm}} to {{nowrap|150 mm}}, and smaller feature sizes.

===Substrate===

The starting material is a flat [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]], such as a silicon wafer or a polished disc of beryllium, copper, titanium, or other material. The substrate, if not already electrically conductive, is covered with a conductive plating base, typically through [[Sputter deposition|sputtering]] or [[Evaporation (deposition)|evaporation]].

The fabrication of high-aspect-ratio structures requires the use of a photoresist able to form a mold with vertical sidewalls. Thus the photoresist must have a high selectivity and be relatively free from stress when applied in thick layers.  The typical choice, poly(methyl methacrylate) ([[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]]) is applied to the substrate by a glue-down process in which a precast, high-molecular-weight sheet of PMMA is attached to the plating base on the substrate. The applied photoresist is then milled down to the precise height by a [[Fly cutter#Fly cutter|fly cutter]] prior to pattern transfer by X-ray exposure. Because the layer must be relatively free from stress, this glue-down process is preferred over alternative methods such as casting.  Further, the cutting of the PMMA sheet by the fly cutter requires specific operating conditions and tools to avoid introducing any stress and [[crazing]] of the photoresist.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Exposure===
A key enabling technology of LIGA is the synchrotron, capable of emitting high-power, highly collimated X-rays. This high collimation permits relatively large distances between the mask and the substrate without the penumbral blurring that occurs from other X-ray sources.  In the electron [[storage ring]] or [[synchrotron]], a magnetic field constrains electrons to follow a circular path and the radial acceleration of the electrons causes electromagnetic radiation to be emitted forward.  The radiation is thus strongly collimated in the forward direction and can be assumed to be parallel for lithographic purposes.  Because of the much higher flux of usable collimated X-rays, shorter exposure times become possible.  Photon energies for a LIGA exposure are approximately distributed between 2.5 and {{nowrap|15 keV}}.

Unlike optical lithography, there are multiple exposure limits, identified as the top dose, bottom dose, and critical dose, whose values must be determined experimentally for a proper exposure.  The exposure must be sufficient to meet the requirements of the bottom dose, the exposure under which a photoresist residue will remain, and the top dose, the exposure over which the photoresist will foam.  The critical dose is the exposure at which unexposed resist begins to be attacked.  Due to the insensitivity of PMMA, a typical exposure time for a {{nowrap|500 µm}} thick PMMA is six hours.  During exposure, secondary radiation effects such as [[Fresnel diffraction]], mask and substrate [[fluorescence]], and the generation of [[Auger electrons]] and [[photoelectron]]s can lead to overexposure.

During exposure the X-ray mask and the mask holder are heated directly by X-ray absorption and cooled by forced convection from nitrogen jets. Temperature rise in PMMA resist is mainly from heat conducted from the substrate backward into the resist and from the mask plate through the inner cavity air forward to the resist, with X-ray absorption being tertiary.  Thermal effects include chemistry variations due to resist heating and geometry-dependent mask deformation.

===Development===
For high-aspect-ratio structures the resist-developer system is required to have a ratio of dissolution rates in the exposed and unexposed areas of 1000:1.  The standard, empirically optimized developer is a mixture of tetrahydro-1,4-oxazine ({{nowrap|20 %}}), 2-aminoethanol-1 ({{nowrap|5 %}}), 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethanol ({{nowrap|60 %}}), and water ({{nowrap|15 %}}).  This developer provides the required ratio of dissolution rates and reduces stress-related cracking from swelling in comparison to conventional PMMA developers.  After development, the substrate is rinsed with deionized water and dried either in a vacuum or by spinning.  At this stage, the PMMA structures can be released as the final product (e.g., optical components) or can be used as molds for subsequent metal deposition.

===Electroplating===

In the electroplating step, nickel, copper, or gold is plated upward from the metalized substrate into the voids left by the removed photoresist. Taking place in an electrolytic cell, the current density, temperature, and solution are carefully controlled to ensure proper plating.  In the case of nickel deposition from NiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a KCl solution, Ni is deposited on the cathode (metalized substrate) and Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolves at the anode.  Difficulties associated with plating into PMMA molds include voids, where hydrogen bubbles nucleate on contaminates; chemical incompatibility, where the plating solution attacks the photoresist; and mechanical incompatibility, where film stress causes the plated layer to lose adhesion.  These difficulties can be overcome through the empirical optimization of the plating chemistry and environment for a given layout.

===Stripping===
After exposure, development, and electroplating, the resist is stripped.  One method for removing the remaining PMMA is to flood expose the substrate and use the developing solution to cleanly remove the resist.  Alternatively, chemical solvents can be used.  Stripping of a thick resist chemically is a lengthy process, taking two to three hours in acetone at room temperature.  In multilayer structures, it is common practice to protect metal layers against corrosion by backfilling the structure with a polymer-based encapsulant.  At this stage, metal structures can be left on the substrate (e.g., microwave circuitry) or released as the final product (e.g., gears).

===Replication===

After stripping, the released metallic components can be used for mass replication through standard means of replication such as [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamping]] or [[injection molding]].

==Commercialization==
In the 1990s, LIGA was a cutting-edge MEMS fabrication technology, resulting in the design of components showcasing the technique's unique versatility.  Several companies that begin using the LIGA process later changed their business model (e.g., Steag microParts becoming Boehringer Ingelheim microParts, Mezzo Technologies). Currently, only two companies, HTmicro and microworks, continue their work in LIGA, benefiting from limitations of other competing fabrication technologies.  UV LIGA, due to its lower production cost, is employed more broadly by several companies, such as Tecan, Temicon, and Mimotec in Switzerland, who supply the Swiss watch market with metal parts made of Nickel and Nickel-Phosphorus.

The '''Larson–Miller parameter''' is a means of predicting the lifetime of material vs. time and temperature using a correlative approach based on the [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius rate equation]]. The value of the parameter is usually expressed as ''LMP'' = ''T''(''C'' + log ''t''), where ''C'' is a material specific constant, often approximated as 20, ''t'' is the time in hours, and ''T'' is the temperature in [[kelvin]]s.

[[Creep (deformation)|Creep]]-stress rupture data for high-temperature creep-resistant alloys are often plotted as log stress to rupture versus
a combination of log time to rupture and temperature. One of the most common time–temperature parameters used to present this kind of data is the Larson–Miller (L.M.) parameter, which in generalized form is
:&lt;math&gt;P(\text{L.M.}) = T[\log t_r + C],&lt;/math&gt;

:''T'' = temperature, K or °R,
:&lt;math&gt;t_r&lt;/math&gt; = stress-rupture time, h,
:''C'' = constant, usually of order 20.

According to the L.M. parameter, at a given stress level the log time to stress rupture plus a constant of the order of 20 multiplied by the temperature in kelvins or degrees Rankine remains constant for a given material.

The '''Lijiaxia Dam''' (李家峡水库) is a concrete [[arch-gravity dam]] on the [[Yellow River]] in [[Jainca County]], [[Qinghai Province]], [[China]]. The dam houses a [[hydroelectric]] power station with 5 x 400 MW generators for a total installed capacity of 2,000 MW. Construction began in April 1988 and the reservoir began to fill on December 26, 1996. On January 26, 1997, the initial reservoir operating level was reached and the first generator was commissioned in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Junguang Bai , Shengdi Lu , and Jianshe Han|title=Landslides and Engineered Slopes.

==Process description==
Water gas is compressed to 20 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] and pumped into the Linde-Frank-Caro reactor. A water column removes most of the  carbon dioxide and [[sulfur]]. Tubes with [[caustic soda]] then remove the remaining carbon dioxide, sulphur, and water from the gas stream. The gas enters a chamber and is cooled to −190 °C, resulting in the condensation of most of the gas to a liquid. The remaining gas is pumped to the next vessel where the [[nitrogen]] is [[Liquefaction of gases|liquefied]] by cooling to −205 °C, resulting in [[hydrogen gas]] as an end product.

[[File:Taper spindle nose with threaded retention.jpg|thumb|Spindle nose on a lathe headstock. The small female taper is a Morse taper to take a [[lathe center]] or a tool such as a twist drill. The large male taper takes a lathe chuck, which is retained by the large nut.]]

A '''machine taper''' is a system for securing [[cutting tool (machining)|cutting tools]] or toolholders in the [[spindle (tool)|spindle]] of a [[machine tool]] or [[power tool]]. A [[gender of connectors and fasteners|male]] member of [[cone|conical]] form (that is, with a [[wikt:taper#Noun|taper]]) fits into the female socket, which has a matching taper of equal [[angle]].

Almost all machine tool spindles, and many power tool spindles, have a taper as their primary method of attachment for tools. Even on many [[drill press]]es, handheld [[drill]]s, and lathes, which have [[chuck (engineering)|chucks]] (such as a [[drill chuck]] or [[collet|collet chuck]]), the chuck is attached by a taper. On drills, drill presses, and [[milling machine]]s, the male member is the tool shank or toolholder shank, and the female socket is integral with the spindle. On [[lathe]]s, the male may belong to the tool or to the spindle; spindle noses may have male tapers, female tapers, or both.

== Explanation ==
[[Machine tool]] operators must be able to install or remove tool bits quickly and easily. A [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]], for example, has a rotating spindle in its headstock, to which one may want to mount a spur drive or work in a [[collet]]. Another example is a [[drill press]], to which an operator may want to mount a bit directly, or using a drill chuck.

Virtually all [[milling machines]], from the oldest manual machines up to the most modern [[CNC]] machines, utilize tooling that is piloted on a tapered surface.

The machine taper is a simple, low-cost, highly [[repeatability|repeatable]], and versatile tool mounting system. It provides [[indexing (motion)|indexability]], as tools can be quickly changed but are [[accuracy and precision|precisely]] located both concentrically and axially by the taper. It also allows high [[power transmission]] across the interface, which is needed for milling.

Machine tapers can be grouped into '''self-holding''' and '''self-releasing''' classes. With self-holding tapers, the [[gender of connectors and fasteners|male and female]] wedge together and bind to each other to the extent that the forces of drilling can be resisted without a drawbar, and the tool will stay in the spindle when idle. It is driven out with a wedge when a tool change is needed. [[#Morse|Morse]] and [[#Jacobs|Jacobs]] tapers are an example of the self-holding variety. With self-releasing tapers, the male will not stick in the female without a drawbar holding it there. However, with good drawbar force, it is very solidly immobile. [[#NMTB taper family|NMTB/CAT]], BT and [[#HSK taper|HSK]] are examples of the self-releasing variety.

For light loads (such as encountered by a lathe tailstock or a drill press), tools with self-holding tapers are simply slipped onto or into the spindle; the pressure of the spindle against the workpiece drives the tapered shank tightly into the tapered hole. The friction across the entire surface area of the interface provides a large amount of [[torque]] transmission, so that splines or keys are not required.

For use with heavy loads (such as encountered by a milling machine spindle), there is usually a key to prevent rotation and/or a threaded section, which is engaged by a [[drawbar (machine tool)|drawbar]] that engages either the threads or the head of a pull stud that is screwed into them. The drawbar is then tightened, drawing the shank firmly into the spindle. The draw-bar is important on milling machines as the transverse force component would otherwise cause the tool to wobble out of the taper.

All machine tapers are sensitive to [[swarf|chips]], nicks (dents), and dirt. They will not locate accurately, and the self-holding variety will not hold reliably, if such problems interfere with the seating of the male into the female with firm contact over the whole conical surface. Machinists are trained on keeping tapers clean and handling them in ways that prevent them from being nicked by other tools. CNC tool-changing cycles usually include a compressed-air blast while one toolholder is being swapped with the next. The air blast tends to blow away chips that might otherwise end up interfering between the toolholder and spindle.

==Use==
Tools with a tapered shank are inserted into a matching tapered socket and pushed or twisted into place. They are then retained by friction.  In some cases, the friction fit needs to be made stronger, as with the use of a [[Drawbar (machine tool)|drawbar]], essentially a long bolt that holds the tool into the socket with more force than is possible by other means.

Caution needs to be exercised in the usual drilling machine or lathe situation, which provides no drawbar to pull the taper into engagement, if a tool is used requiring a high torque but providing little axial resistance. An example would be the use of a large diameter drill to slightly enlarge an existing hole. In this situation, there may be considerable rotary loading. In contrast, the cutting action will require very little thrust or feed force. Thrust helps to keep the taper seated and provides essential frictional coupling.

The tang is not engineered to withstand twisting forces which are sufficient to cause the taper to slip, and will frequently break off in this situation. This will allow the tool to spin in the female taper, which is likely to damage it. Morse taper reamers are available to alleviate minor damage.

Tapered shanks "stick" in a socket best when both the shank and the socket are clean. Shanks can be wiped clean, but sockets, being deep and inaccessible, are best cleaned with a specialized taper cleaning tool which is inserted, twisted, and removed.

Tapered shank tools are removed from a socket using different approaches, depending on the design of the socket.  In [[Pillar drill#Drill press|drill presses]] and similar tools, the tool is removed by inserting a wedge shaped block of metal called a "drift" into a rectangular shaped cross hole through the socket and tapping it.  As the cross section of the drift gets larger when the drift is driven further in, the result is that the drift, bearing against the foremost edge of the tang, pushes the tool out.  In many [[Tailstock|lathe tailstocks]], the tool is removed by fully withdrawing the quill into the tailstock, which brings the tool up against the end of the leadscrew or an internal stud, separating the taper and releasing the tool.   Where the tool is retained by a drawbar, as in some mill spindles, the drawbar is partially unthreaded with a wrench and then tapped with a hammer, which separates the taper, at which point the tool can be further unthreaded and removed. Some mill spindles have a captive drawbar which ejects the tool when actively unscrewed past the loose stage; these do not require tapping. For simple sockets with open access to the back end, a drift punch is inserted axially from behind and the tool tapped out.

==Types==
There are many standard tapers, which differ based on the following:
* the diameter at the small end of the truncated cone ("the minor diameter")
* the diameter at the large end of the truncated cone ("the major diameter") and
* the axial distance between the two ends of the truncated cone.

The standards are grouped into families that may include different sizes. The taper within a family may or may not be consistent. The Jarno and NMTB tapers are consistent, but the Jacobs and Morse families vary.

There are adaptors available to allow the use of one type of taper tooling, e.g. Morse, on a machine with a different taper, e.g. R8 or vice versa, and simpler adaptors consisting of an externally and internally tapered sleeve to allow a small Morse tool to be used in a machine of larger bore.

One of the first uses of tapers was to mount [[Drill bit#Morse taper shank drills|drill bits]] directly to machine tools, such as in the [[tailstock]] of a lathe, although later [[Chuck (engineering)#Drill|drill chucks]] were developed that held parallel shank drill bits.

===Brown &amp; Sharpe===
Brown &amp; Sharpe tapers, standardized by the [[Brown &amp; Sharpe|company]] of the same name, are an alternative to the more-commonly seen Morse taper. Like the Morse, these have a series of sizes, from 1 to 18, with 7, 9 and 11 being the most common. Actual taper on these lies within a narrow range close to .500&amp;nbsp;inches per foot.

===Jacobs===
The Jacobs Taper (abbreviated JT) is commonly used to secure drill press chucks to an [[Mandrel|arbor]].  The taper angles are not consistent varying from 1.41° per side for #0 (and the obscure #{{frac|2|1|2}}) to 2.33° per side for #2 (and #2 short).

There are also several sizes between #2 and #3: #2 short, #6 and #33.

===Jarno===
Jarno tapers use a greatly simplified scheme. The rate of taper is 1:20 on diameter, in other words 0.600" on diameter per foot, .050" on diameter per inch.
Tapers range from a Number 2 to a Number 20. The diameter of the big end in inches is always the taper size divided by 8, the small end is always the taper size divided by 10 and the length is the taper size divided by 2. For example, a Jarno #7 measures 0.875" (7/8) across the big end. The small end measures 0.700" (7/10) and the length is 3.5" (7/2).

The system was invented by Oscar J. Beale of [[Brown &amp; Sharpe]].

===Morse===
[[File:Morse Taper No 2.jpg|thumb|Morse Taper#2 (MT2)|250px]]

The Morse taper was developed by [[Stephen A. Morse]], based in New Bedford Massachusetts, in the mid-1860s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morsecuttingtools.com/cgi/CGPTABOUT?PAMENU=7_1 Morse Cutting Tools History].&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has evolved to encompass smaller and larger sizes and has been adopted as a standard by numerous organizations, including the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) as ISO 296 and the [[German Institute for Standardization]] (DIN) as DIN 228-1. It is one of the most widely used types, and is particularly common on the shank of taper-shank twist drills and machine reamers, in the spindles of industrial drill presses, and in the tailstocks of lathes. The taper angle of the Morse taper varies somewhat with size but is typically 1.49 degrees (around 3 degrees included).

Some modular orthopedic total [[Hip replacement|hip implants]] use a Morse taper to mate components together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 10829545 | volume=45 | issue=4 | title=The Morse taper junction in modular revision hip replacement--a biomechanical and retrieval analysis. | date=Apr 2000 | journal=Biomed Tech (Berl) | pages=105–9 | doi=10.1515/bmte.2000.45.4.105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some [[dental implant]]s use a Morse taper to connect components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Clinical and Laboratory Manual of Dental Implant Abutments|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5b8BBAAAQBAJ|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|date = 2014-07-09|isbn = 9781118928530|language = en|first = Hamid R.|last = Shafie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sizes====
Morse tapers come in eight sizes identified by whole numbers between 0 and 7, and one half-size (4 1/2 - very rarely found, and not shown in the table).
Often the designation is abbreviated as MT followed by a digit, for example a Morse taper number 4 would be MT4. The MT2 taper is the size most often found in drill presses up to {{frac|1|2}}" capacity. Stub (short) versions, the same taper angle but a little over half the usual length, are occasionally encountered for the whole number sizes from 1 through 5. There are standards for these, which among other things are sometimes used in lathe head stocks to preserve a larger spindle through-hole.

====End types====
Morse tapers are of the self-holding variety, and can have three types of ends:
* tang (illustrated) to facilitate removal with a [[Drift pin|drift]]
* threaded to be held in place with a [[Drawbar (machine tool)|drawbar]]
* flat (no tang or threaded section)

Self holding tapers rely on a heavy preponderance of axial load over torsional load to transmit high torques. Problems may arise using large drills in relation to the shank, if the pilot hole is too large. The threaded style is essential for any sideloading, particularly milling. The only exception is that such unfavourable situations can be simulated to remove a jammed shank. Permitting chatter will help release the grip. The acute (narrow) taper angle can result in such jamming with heavy axial loads, or over long periods.

End-milling cutters with a Morse taper shank with a tang are occasionally seen: for security these must be used with a C-collar or similar, fitting into the neck between cutter and shank, and pulling back against the large end of the taper

The taper itself is roughly 5/8" per foot, but exact ratios and dimensions for the various sizes of tang type tapers are given below.

===B Tapers===

B-series tapers are a DIN standard typically used for fitting chucks on their arbors, like the older Jacobs taper series. Each taper in the B-series is effectively the small or large end of a Morse taper:

:B10 = small end of MT1
:B12 = large end of MT1
:B16 = small end of MT2
:B18 = large end of MT2
:B22 = small end of MT3
:B24 = Large end of MT3

The number after the B is the diameter of the large end of the taper to the nearest mm, and 'about' 1mm larger than the large end of the socket (~2mm in the case of B22 and B24) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cooperhandtools.com.au/PDFs/Jacobs%20Chucks%20Technical-Information.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===NMTB taper family===
[[File:1941-G.jpg|thumb|Toolholder for milling machine with CAT-40 taper.]]
The [[National Machine Tool Builders Association]] (now called the Association for Manufacturing Technology) defined a steep taper that is commonly used on milling machines. The taper is variously referred to as NMTB, NMT or NT. The taper is 3.500&amp;nbsp;inches per foot and is also referred to as "7 in 24" or 7/24; the computed angle is 16.5943 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;The angle of the cone is {{math|2&amp;nbsp;atan(7/48)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  All NMTB tooling has this taper but the tooling comes in different sizes: NMTB-10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 60.  These tapers were apparently also specified in ASA (now ANSI) B5.10-1943.

NMTB is a "self releasing" or "fast" taper.  Unlike the more acute self holding tapers above, such tapers are not designed to transmit high torque; high torques are carried by driving keys engaging slots on the flange.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Burlingame |first=Luther D. |title=Standards for Large Taper Shanks and Sockets |journal=Journal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers |date=December 1918 |volume=40 |issue=12 |pages=1014–1016 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HohNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1014&amp;lpg=PA1014&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;f=false |quote=As shown in Table 1, the well-established tapers for shanks and sockets now in use vary from &amp;frac12; in. to 1 in. or more per ft., the tendency being to use a somewhat steeper taper for the larger than for the small sizes, perhaps because with small tapers, the liability to slip produced by the work is not so great and the "bite" of the taper when forced into the socket is sufficient to secure effective driving.  In the larger sizes, tenons or tongues must be provided to aid in driving and in the still larger sizes keys of some form are needed, as, unless the angle of taper is very slight, the tenons are liable to be twisted off.  When such auxiliary means of driving is provided the taper can be made steeper, giving the advantage that the parts can be more easily separated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armitage|Kearney|Graves|Nenninger|1931|p=3}} stating, "The [tool shank] is now firmly coupled with the spindle, the complementary tapered portions serving to insure accurate axial alignment while the complementary keys and slots serve to drive the [tool shank] from the spindle in either direction of rotation and the [drawbar] retains the [tool shank] firmly seated in such position."&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose is to allow a quick and easy change between different tools (either automatically or by hand) while ensuring the tool or toolholder will be tightly and rigidly connected to the spindle, and accurately coaxial with it. The larger end adjacent to the tool makes for more rigidity than is possible with Morse or R8 tapers fitted to comparable machines.

Patent 1794361 (filed 25 March 1927) describes milling machine spindle and tool shapes using a steep taper.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |country-code=US |patent-number=1794361 |title=Milling Machine Spindle and Tool |file-date=25 March 1927 |issue-date=3 March 1931 |inventor1-last=Armitage |inventor1-first=Joseph B. |inventor2-last=Kearney |inventor2-first=Edward J. |inventor3-last=Graves |inventor3-first=Benjamin P. |inventor4-last=Nenninger |inventor4-first=Lester F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The patent was assigned to Kearney &amp; Trecker Corporation, [[Brown &amp; Sharpe]], and [[Cincinnati Milling Machine Company]]. The patent wanted a taper that would freely release the tool and found that a taper of 3.5 in 12 had that property.&lt;ref name="patentp2"&gt;{{harvnb|Armitage|Kearney|Graves|Nenninger|1931|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The patent also used the keys and slots and a tail on the tool shank to prevent the tool shank from falling out of a horizontal mill's spindle while the operator connected the drawbar.&lt;ref name="patentp2"/&gt;

ANSI B5.18-1972 specifies some essential dimensions for milling machine spindles and tool shanks using taper sizes 30, 40, 45, 50, 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Machinery's Handbook |edition=22nd |pages=1748–1752 |publisher=Industrial Press |date=1987 |isbn=0-8311-1155-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specifications describe the position of the driving key and flange and the thread of the draw-in bolt that holds the shank in the spindle.

The tooling is referred to as Quick Change; National Machine Tool Builders' Association, 1927; NMTB; American Standard Machine Taper, ANSI B5.18; DIN 2080 / IS 2340; ISO R 290-2583.&lt;ref name="gizmos"&gt;http://www.tools-n-gizmos.com/specs/Tapers.html&lt;/ref&gt;  There are slight variations in threads and flanges (JIS B 6339: MAS 403); and the European standards (e.g., '''ISO taper''') use metric draw threads.

The NMTB tool shanks had the 7 in 24 taper, but they also had a constant diameter tail (pilot) at the end of the shank that was described in the 1927 patent. Subsequent design variations dropped the tail (making the shank shorter) and put a V-groove in the flange that aided automated tool changing. Modern designs started using power drawbars that gripped pull studs (also known as retention knobs) that were screwed into the tool shank rather than screw-in drawbars. The power drawbar would grip the pull stud rather than screwing into the tool shank.

The more modern toolholder designs became known as the Caterpillar "V-Flange", CAT, V-Flange, ANSI B5.50, SK, ISO, International (INT), BT, ISO 7388-1, DIN 69871, NFE 62540. Once again, there are slight variations in the tooling.&lt;ref name="gizmos"/&gt; Although the basic taper dimensions are the same, there are differences are in the flanges, draw-in thread sizes, and pull studs; the international versions use metric sizes.

===HSK taper===
[[File:DIN 69893 HSK A63 3drender 1.png|thumb|HSK A63 shank]]
[[File:DIN 69893 hsk 63a drawing.png|thumb|Drawing of HSK A63 shank]]
[[File:DIN 69893 hsk 63a.svg|thumb|Animation of HSK toolholder]]
HSK toolholders were developed in the early 1990s. HSK stands for [[:de:Hohlschaftkegel|Hohlschaftkegel]]; German for "hollow shank tapers".

Steep tapers tend to loosen at high speed, as their solid shanks are stiffer than the spindles they fit into, so under high centrifugal force, the spindle expands more than the toolholder which changes the overall length: That is, as the spindle 'expands' the toolholder tends to move deeper into the spindle in the z-axis which can cause the production of parts that are out-of-tolerance.  HSK's hollow shank is deliberately thin and flexible, so it expands more than the spindle and tightens when rotating at high speed. Furthermore, the HSK holder is dual contact: It engages with the spindle on both the taper and the top of the flange which prevents axial movement when thermal growth and/or centrifugal force of the spindle occurs.

The flexibility is also used to provide accurate axial location.  An HSK toolholder has both a tapered shank, and a flange with a mating surface.  The shank is short (about half as long as other machine tapers), with a shallow taper (a ratio of 1:10&lt;!--Technically, the shank standard is 1:9.98 and the receiver is 1:10. --&gt;), and slightly too large to allow the flange to seat fully in the socket.  The thin walls, short shank and shallow taper provide a large opening in the back of the tool.  An expanding collet fits in there, and mates with 30° chamfer inside the shank.  As the drawbar retracts, it expands the collet and pulls the shank back into the socket, compressing the shank until the flange seats against the front of the spindle.  This provides a stiff, repeatable connection because it utilizes the centrifugal force inside the spindle. As centrifugal forces increase the expanding collet within the HSK forces the walls of the toolholder shank to stay in contact with the spindle wall.

The HSK design was developed as a nonproprietary standard. The working group that produced the HSK standard consisted of representatives from academia, the Association of German Tool Manufacturing and a group of international companies and end users. The results were the German [[DIN]] standards 69063 for the spindle and 69893 for the shank.
The HSK working group did not adopt a specific product design, but rather a set of standards that defined HSK toolholders for different applications. The group defined a total of six HSK shank forms, in 9 sizes.

Sizes are identified by the diameter of the shank’s flange in millimeters. These diameters are taken from the R10′ series of [[preferred number]]s, from 25 to 160&amp;nbsp;mm.

Today, the shank forms are designated by the letters A through F and T. The main differences between the forms are the positions of the drive slots, gripper-locating slots, coolant holes and the area of the flange.

A is the basic form.  The B-form shank is a variant for high-torque applications, and has a flange one size larger relative to its shaft diameter.  (Thus, an A-40 shank will fit into a B-50 socket.)

Forms C and D are simplified variants of A and B for manual use, eliminating features to accommodate automatic tool changers like a V-groove and associated orientation slots, and a recess for an RFID chip.

Forms E and F flanges and tapers are similar to forms A and B, but designed for very high speed machining (20,000&amp;nbsp;rpm and up) of light materials by eliminating all asymmetric features to minimize imbalance and vibration.

This permits non-rotating [[lathe]] tooling to be held accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is HSK-T? |date=9 October 2014 |publisher=NT Tool Co. |url=http://www.nttool.com/support/catalog/en_6_hsk_t.pdf |accessdate=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An HSK connection depends on a combination of axial clamping forces and taper-shank interference. All these forces are generated and controlled by the mating components’ design parameters. The shank and spindle both must have precisely mating tapers and faces that are square to the taper’s axis. There are several HSK clamping methods. All use some mechanism to amplify the clamping action of equally spaced collet segments. When the toolholder is clamped into the spindle, the drawbar force produces a firm metal-to-metal contact between the shank and the ID of the clamping unit. An additional application of drawbar force positively locks the two elements together into a joint with a high level of radial and axial rigidity. As the collet segments rotate, the clamping mechanism gains centrifugal force. The HSK design actually harnesses centrifugal force to increase joint strength. Centrifugal force also causes the thin walls of the shank to deflect radially at a faster rate than the walls of the spindle. This contributes to a secure connection by guaranteeing strong contact between the shank and the spindle. The automotive and aerospace industries are the largest users of HSK toolholders. Another industry that is seeing increasing use is the mold and die industry.

=== R8 ===
[[File:HardingeR8Collets.jpg|thumb|collets with R8 taper]]
This taper was designed by [[Bridgeport Machines, Inc.]] for use in its milling machines. R8 tapers are not self-holding, so they require a drawbar extending up through the spindle to the top of the machine to prevent loosening when lateral forces are encountered. They are also keyed (see image) to prevent rotation during insertion and removal, although it is the taper that transmits torque in use. The drawbar thread is typically {{frac|7|16}}″–20&amp;nbsp;tpi ([[Unified Thread Standard|UNF]]). The angle of the cone is 16°51′ (16.85°) with an OD of 1.25″ and a length of {{frac|15|16}}″.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldengine.org/members/diesel/Tables/Clarkson3.htm Machine Tool Taper Dimensions: Bridgeport R8 &amp; Deckel Int40]&lt;/ref&gt; (source, Bridgeport Manufacturer) The diameter of the parallel locating portion is not a "fractional inch" size like the other dimensions and is 0.949″ to 0.9495″.

Tools with an R8 taper are inserted directly into the machine's spindle. R8 collets are typically used to hold tooling with round shanks, although any shape can be held if the collet has the corresponding shape cut in it. The collets have a precision bore with axial compression slots for holding cutting tools and are threaded for the drawbar. The R8 system is commonly used with collets ranging in size from {{frac|1|8}}″ to {{frac|3|4}}″ in diameter or tool holders with the same or slightly larger diameters. The collets or tool holders are placed directly into the spindle and the drawbar is tightened into the top of the collet or tool holder from above the spindle. Other tools such as drill chucks, fly cutters, indexable insert cutters, etc. may have an R8 taper shank built into or added to the tool.

The R8 taper is commonly encountered on Bridgeport and similar turret mills from the USA, or on (very common) copies of these mills from elsewhere. The popularity is due in large part to the success of Bridgeport and other mills that were closely modeled after it and produced throughout much of the 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1707">A '''nanoinverter''', also referred as '''nano inverter''' or '''solar nano inverter''', converts [[direct current]] (DC) from a single [[solar cell]] or small [[solar panel]] to [[alternating current]] (AC).  Nanoinverters contrast with [[microinverter]] devices, which are connected to larger than 100 Watt solar panels.

Nanoinverters have several advantages over [[microinverter]]s. The main advantage is that, even small amounts of [[Photovoltaic system#Shading and dirt|shading, debris or snow lines]] in any one solar cell, or a smaller panel failure, does not disproportionately reduce the output of an entire larger panel. Each nanoinverter obtains optimum power by performing [[maximum power point tracking]] for its connected panel.

==Description==

===Building Integrated Photo Voltaics===
[[Building-integrated photovoltaics|BIPV]] modules produce [[direct current]] power from range 10 watts to 100 watts.
Integrated circuit-based AC nanoinverter on each module increases harvest rate by 30% and substantially decreases the installation constraints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpwsa.electroiq.com/index/display/pv-wire-news-display/1469574627.html] Government of Canada Supports for BIPV nano-inverter.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar Cell===
DC nanoconverter-on-chip is capable to harvest from microwatts power and as low as 80mV (0.08V) voltage.  Harvest rate improves 30%-70% with integrated [[Maximum power point tracking|MPPT]] and [[Boost converter|DC-DC booster]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ti.com/product/bq25504] Ultra Low Power Boost Converter with Battery Management for Energy Harvester App&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norman Leslie James''' (November 29, 1840 - November 25, 1918) was a farmer, lumber manufacturer and hardware retailer from [[Richland Center, Wisconsin]] who served as a member of the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] and the [[Wisconsin State Senate]].

== Background ==
James was born November 29, 1840 in [[Deerfield, New Hampshire]]. He received a [[Public school (government funded)|common school]] education, and came to Wisconsin with his family, eventually settling in Richland Center.

With his little brother David, James entered the [[United States Army]] in 1861, joining Company F of [[16th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], upon the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. He participated in the [[Battle of Shiloh|Battle of Pittsburg Landing]], and was discharged in 1862.

== Public office ==
James served as a member of the [[political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Towns|town]] and [[political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Villages|village]] board, and village [[treasurer]]. He was first elected to the Assembly for [[Richland County, Wisconsin|Richland County's]] first Assembly district (the Towns of (Towns of [[Buena Vista, Richland County, Wisconsin|Buena Vista]], [[Henrietta, Wisconsin|Henrietta]], [[Ithaca, Wisconsin|Ithaca]], [[Orion, Wisconsin|Orion]], [[Richland, Richland County, Wisconsin|Richland]], [[Rockbridge, Wisconsin|Rockbridge]], [[Westford, Richland County, Wisconsin|Westford]] and [[Willow, Wisconsin|Willow]]) in 1872 as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]; he did not seek re-election, and was succeeded by fellow Republican [[Joseph McGrew]]. He was elected again in 1874, with 776 votes to 659 for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] V. G. Harter. He was not a candidate for re-election in 1875, and was succeeded by Democrat [[J. L. R. McCollum]].

James served as a [[delegate]] to the [[1880 Republican National Convention]]. He was elected state senator for the [[Wisconsin Senate, District 28|28th District]] (at that time consisting of [[Iowa County, Wisconsin|Iowa]] and Richland Counties) in 1884 (Republican incumbent [[William Meffert]] was not a candidate), receiving 4,712 votes, against 4,291 for Democrat George Crawford  and 573 for [[Prohibition Party|Prohibitionist]] John Lee. He served as chairman of the [[standing committee]] on [[railroads]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1887 Timme, Ernst G., ed. ''The blue book of the state of Wisconsin 1887'' Madison, 1887; p. 490]&lt;/ref&gt; He was not a candidate for re-election in 1888, and was succeeded by another Republican, [[Robert Joiner]]

== Career ==
James was described in the [[Wisconsin Blue Book]]s as a merchant and a hardware merchant. He testified in a Congressional hearing that he manufactured lumber, and sold lumber at retail.

In 1911, he testified before the [[United States Senate]] about his involvement in the election of [[Isaac Stephenson]] to the Senate from Wisconsin. He described himself as a longtime friend and supporter of Stephenson, whom he had met when they were both delegates to the 1880 Republican National Convention, and with whom he often went [[fishing]]. He testified that the only money he had been paid from the campaign was reimbursement for expenditures he'd made in support of Stephenson's election. He testified that while he was not (as had been inquired) "a man of some means," nonetheless "... I have always taken an active part in politics. That is, I have always had some man as a candidate that I was interest in." &lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on Privileges and Elections ''Senator from Wisconsin: Hearings before a subcommittee of the Committee on Privileges and Elections, United States Senate, Sixty-second Congress, under the resolution (S. Res. 136) directing the Committee on privileges and elections, or any subcommittee thereof, to investigate whether corrupt methods and practices were used or employed in the election of Isaac Stephenson as a senator of the United States from the state of Wisconsin''. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1911; vol. 1, pp. 884-889&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
James' brother, [[David James (Wisconsin politician)|David Goodrich James]], was a member of the Senate from the same district from 1909 to 1912. His niece [[Ada James]] became a noted [[suffragist]].

He died in Richland Center on November 25, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;'Journal Proceedings of the...Session of the Wisconsin Legislature, 1919, Wisconsin Joint Resolution 12-Assembly, the Honorable Norman L. James, pg. 172-173&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ww2-oiler-Arnold-R-Fesser.jpg|right|thumb|Arnold R. Fesser, oiler, 17 years at sea: "We got a big job to do until this war is won. We will keep them sailing until the end. Then we have got time for holidays." October 14, 1944.]]

An '''oiler''' (also known as a "greaser") is a worker whose main job is [[Lubrication|to oil machinery]]. In previous eras there were oiler positions in various industries, including maritime work ([[navy|naval]] and [[Ship transport|commercial]]), [[Rail transport|railroading]], [[steelmaking]], and [[mining]]. Today most such positions have been eliminated through technological change; lubrication tends to require less human intervention, so that workers seldom have oiling as a principal duty. In the days of ubiquitous [[plain bearing]]s, oiling was often a job description in and of itself.

Today, shipping is the economic segment that most thoroughly retains the notion of the oiler as a separate position. On a [[Merchant vessel|merchant ship]], an oiler is an unlicensed rate of the [[engineering department]]. The position is of the junior rate in the engine room of a ship. The oiler is senior only to a [[Wiper (occupation)|wiper]]. Once a sufficient amount of sea time is acquired, the Oiler can apply to take a series of courses/examinations to become certified as an [[Engineering officer (ship)|engineer]].

As a member of the engineering department, the oiler operates and maintains the propulsion and other systems on board the vessel. Oilers also deal with the "hotel" facilities on board, notably the [[sewage]], lighting, [[air conditioning]], and water systems. They assist bulk fuel transfers and require training in [[firefighting]] and first aid. Moreover, oilers help facilitate operation of the ship's boats and other nautical tasks – especially with cargo loading/discharging gear and safety systems. However, the specific cargo discharge function remains the responsibility of deck officers and deck workers.

==Tools==
* [[Oil can]]s (which themselves are sometimes referred to as "oilers") 
* [[Grease gun (tool)|Grease gun]]s 
* Rags and brushes

== Legal requirements ==

Under international conventions and agreements specifically the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (or [[STCW]]), all oilers who sail internationally are documented by their respective countries. Recent changes to the STCW no longer refer to specific rates such as oiler. The terms Able Seafarer-Engine and Able Seafarer-Deck are now used to refer to unlicensed positions on vessels engaged in international trade. 

In the United States, Title 46 (Shipping) of the Code of Federal Regulations governs who is eligible to sail as an oiler in National trade. 

=== United States ===
A person has to have a [[Merchant Mariner's Document]] issued by the [[United States Coast Guard]] in order to be employed as an oiler in the [[United States Merchant Marine]]. 

=== Canada ===

To work as an oiler in the [[Canadian Coast Guard]], it is required that the individual holds an engine room rating certificate. In order to obtain this certificate the applicant must first have no less than six months of documented sea time working under the supervision of a watch keeping engineer. The applicant must then go to a Transport Canada Office and have a written and oral exam before the certificate is issued. It is also required for all sea going personnel to have MED (marine emergency duty) certificates which can be obtained by taking courses through a college approved for training.

Oilers working for the Canadian Coast Guard have various duties, some of which include, performing regular maintenance of the ship's engines and other equipment, assisting the engineers with the repair and overhaul of the ship’s engines and equipment, making regular rounds of the engine room and designated spaces and alerting the engineer on watch of any problems noted. The oiler is also required to keep the engine room clean, tidy and freshly painted. They are the most junior crewmember of the engineering department in the Canadian Coast Guard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4123">{{About|PReferential OXidation}}
'''PROX''' is an acronym for '''PReferential OXidation''', and refers to the preferential [[oxidation]] of a gas on a [[catalyst]].

The catalyst preferentially oxidises [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) using a heterogeneous catalyst placed upon a ceramic support. Catalysts include metals such as [[platinum]], platinum/iron, platinum/ruthenium, gold nanoparticles as well as novel copper oxide/ceramic conglomerate catalysts.&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Y. |author2=Q. Fu |author3=M.F. Stephanopoulos|title=Preferentialoxidation of CO in H2 over CuO-CeO2 catalysts|journal=Catalysis Today|date=1 September 2004|volume= 93–95|pages=241–246|doi=10.1016/j.cattod.2004.06.049|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920586104002792|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==
This reaction is a considerable subject area of research with implications for [[fuel cell]] design.
Its main utility lies in the removal of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) from the fuel cell's feed gas. CO poisons the [[catalysis|catalyst]] of most low-temperature fuel cells.

Carbon monoxide is often produced as a by-product from [[steam reforming]] of hydrocarbons, which produces hydrogen and CO.
It is possible to consume most of the CO by reacting it with steam in the [[water-gas shift reaction]]:

:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The water-gas shift reaction can reduce CO to 1% of the feed, with the added benefit of producing more hydrogen, but not eliminate it completely.
To be used in a fuel cell, feed gas must have CO below 10 [[parts per million|ppm]].

== Description ==
The PROX process allows for the reaction of CO with oxygen, reducing CO concentration from approximately 0.5&amp;ndash;1.5% in the feed gas to less than 10 ppm.

:2CO + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Due to the prevalent presence of hydrogen in the feed gas, the competing, undesired combustion of hydrogen will also occur to some degree:

:2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The selectivity of the process is a measure of the quality of the reactor, and is defined as the ratio of consumed carbon monoxide to the total of consumed hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

The disadvantage of this technology is its very strong [[exothermic]] nature, coupled with a very narrow optimal operation temperature window, and is best operated between 353 and 450 [[kelvin]]s,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} yielding a hydrogen loss of around one percent.  Effective cooling is therefore required. In order to minimise steam generation, excessive dilution with nitrogen is used. Additionally the reaction is interrupted with an intermediary cooler before proceeding to a second stage.

In the first reaction an excess of oxygen is provided, at around a factor of two, and about 90% of the CO is transformed. In the second step a substantially higher oxygen excess is used, at approximately a factor of 4, which is then processed with the remaining CO, in order to reduce the CO concentration to less than 10 ppm. To also avoid excess CO-fraction loading, the transient operation of a CO [[adsorber]] may be important.

The instrumentation and process control complexity requirements are relatively high. The advantage of this technique over selective [[methanation]] is the higher space velocity, which reduces the required reactors size. For the case of strong temperature rises, the feed of air can simply be broken.

The technical origins for CO-PrOx lies in the synthesis of ammonia ([[Haber process]]). Ammonia synthesis also has a strict requirement of CO-free [[syngas]], as CO is a strong catalyst poison for the usual catalysts used in this process.

'''Paper texture effects in calotype photography''' limit the ability of this early process to record low contrast details and textures.  A [[calotype]] is a photographic negative produced on uncoated paper.  (See [[Paper negative]].)  An important feature is that a relatively short exposure in a camera produces a latent image that is subsequently made visible by development.  Then positive images for viewing are obtained by [[contact printing]].  This technique was in use principally from 1840 into the 1850s, when it was displaced by photography on glass.  Skilled photographers were able to achieve dramatic results with the calotype process, and the reason for its eclipse may not be evident from viewing reproductions of early work.

==Background==
Practical photography plausibly dates from the announcement of the [[Daguerreotype]] in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont Newhall, '''Latent Image''', Chapter 1, Anchor Books, Garden City, copyright 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;  This stimulated work by others: in 1840, the Englishman Talbot discovered what he called the calotype process for making photographic negatives on writing paper with the relatively short exposure time of a few minutes for subjects in bright sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;John Ward, Introduction, p. 5.  In Rollin Buckman, '''The Photographic Work of Calvert Richard Jones''', Science Museum, London, copyright 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  A positive print could subsequently be made by pressing a negative under glass against another piece of sensitive paper and exposing it to sunlight.  For this, negatives were waxed to make them more transparent.  Since many prints could be made from a single negative, [[travel photography]] became possible, and prints from calotypes were soon distributed in book form and sold in shops.&lt;ref&gt;Newhall, '''op. cit.''', pp. 119-122 and 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Ward, '''op. cit.''', pp. 9 and 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The chemical operations used to make a calotype were not difficult to perform, and relatively few specialized supplies were required.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Morris, Chapter 2 Calotype Negatives.  In '''Coming into Focus''', edited by John Barnier, Chronicle Books, San Francisco, copyright 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Greene, '''Primitive Photography''', Focal Press, Boston, copyright 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the process had a serious deficiency, and it was quickly replaced by photography on glass when this became practical.&lt;ref&gt;Newhall, '''op. cit.''', pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of paper texture==
Paper texture limits what can be done with the calotype process.  This texture can be seen by holding a piece of copier paper up to the light: the way fibers clump in the paper making process causes a relatively low contrast pattern that may remind one of bushes growing on a hillside.&lt;ref&gt;Sheet Formation and Uniformity, Cranberry Corner column of Hand Papermaking Newsletter #53 (January, 2001), Hand Papermaking, Beltsville, MD, copyright 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bo Norman, Web Forming, Chapter 10, pp. 173-202.  In Monica Ek, Goran Gellerstedt, and Gunnar Henriksson, Eds., '''Paper Chemistry and Technology Volume 3''', de Gruyter, Berlin, copyright 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  This pattern persists when paper is waxed, as similarly examining a piece of commercial waxed paper used for wrapping food will show.  Since the contrast in the pattern is low, it does not interfere with tracing a drawing if the paper is thin enough for dark lines to show through.  But it is very effective at obscuring low contrast patterns and textures and making them invisible.  Consequently, calotype photographs can show bold outlines and high-contrast details clearly, but low-contrast details and textures tend to be lost because of non-uniform paper transmittance.  Paper texture effects are limiting in nature photography, for example, where one expects to capture subtle patterns such as those produced by plants growing in close proximity or pebbles in a streambed.  Early calotype photographers appear to have dealt with texture by composing with an eye for high contrasts and bold outlines.  However, they sometimes resorted to inking in the sky areas of their negatives to eliminate distracting mottling.&lt;ref&gt;Rollin Buckman, '''The Photographic Work of Calvert Richard Jones''', p. 33, Science Museum, London, copyright 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Information given in various works where calotype images are reproduced indicates that negative sizes of 20 x 25&amp;nbsp;cm (8 x 10 in) or greater were not unusual.&lt;ref&gt;Buckman, '''op. cit.'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minor White, Andre Jammes, and Robert Sobieszek, '''French Primitive Photography''', Aperture, Millerton, copyright 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''In Focus William Henry Fox Talbot''', Photographs from the J. Paul Getty Museum, Weston Naef, General Editor, Getty Publications, Los Angeles, copyright 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  This seems practical for a professional who planned to profit from the sale of contact prints that would be the same size as the original negative, but less so for an amateur because of the large amounts of silver nitrate required.  The way paper texture effects become relatively more pronounced as negative size decreases can be demonstrated with a digital camera by photographing a sheet of paper lit from behind, first at a distance where the sheet just overfills the field of view, and then at a closer distance where the field of view is perhaps one third as wide.  (A stack of the same paper will appear much more uniform if it is viewed by ''reflected'' light with diffuse illumination.)  Anyone who wishes to make calotypes today should expect that otherwise successful negatives will suffer in comparison to the best surviving early work if a relatively small format such as 10 x 10&amp;nbsp;cm (4 x 4 in) is used.  Despite the use of large formats and careful paper selection,&lt;ref&gt;Buckman, '''op. cit.''', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; continuing dissatisfaction with paper stimulated the invention of the collodion on glass process (see [[Collodion process]]) that quickly displaced calotypes after 1851,&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Scott Archer, '''The Collodion Process on Glass''', Second Edition, London, 1854, pp. 8-9.  In '''The Collodion Process and the Ferrotype''', edited by Robert A. Sobieszek, Arno, New York, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; even though paper was the easier medium to work with.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Osterman and France Scully Osterman, Chapter 6 Collodion: Wet-Plate Negatives, Ambrotypes, and Tintypes.  In '''Coming into Focus''', edited by John Barnier, Chronicle Books, San Francisco, copyright 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:Rocky hillside calotype 110109.JPG|thumb|alt=Boulders on a desert hillside.|A contact print from a calotype paper negative. The original negative size was about 10 x 7.5 cm (4 x 3 in).]]

==Paper vs. negatives on glass==
To understand why the calotype process could sometimes produce attractive results but was found to be generally unsatisfactory, it would be useful to compare pictures of the same subject taken with first paper and then with glass (or clear plastic film) as the negative substrate.  An easier way to gain insight into the destructive effect of low contrast spurious texture is to view a relatively large format (not 35&amp;nbsp;mm) photographic negative in contact with a piece of tracing paper by transmitted light.&lt;ref&gt;Newhall, '''op. cit.''', p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;  Positives can be made with a digital camera and digital image processing so that the two cases, with and without the tracing paper, can be compared side by side.  Viewed from a distance, the image made through the tracing paper may seem satisfactory.  But from closer up, the paper texture will appear more intrusive and begin to [[camouflage]] low contrast scene details.  This comparison will also demonstrate that paper texture is relatively coarse and, unlike pixelation in a typical digital image, does not quickly become inconspicuous as the distance from which it is viewed increases.&lt;ref&gt;Rajinder P. Khosla, From Photons to Bits, pp. 42-49, Physics Today, December, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Here it is significant to note that the scale of mottling in paper correlates to the average fiber length, which is on the order of millimeters, rather than to the much smaller fiber width.&lt;ref&gt;N. Provatas, M. J. Alava, and T. Ala-Nissila, Density correlations in paper, Physical Review E, Volume 54, Number 1, July 1996, pp. R36-R38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Rocky hillside gelatin on glass 110109.JPG|thumb|alt=A second view of the same boulders.|A contact print from a silver bromide/gelatin on glass negative.  The same camera and the same contact printing process ([[cyanotype]], reproduced here in gray scale) were used to make both images.]]

==Hazard warning==
[[Silver nitrate]] and other materials used by early photographers are hazardous.  Consult references to learn about potential hazards involved in duplicating their methods.  Safety goggles are essential for eye protection.

The '''Pulsometer steam pump''' is a [[pistonless pump]] which was patented in 1872&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was introduced to the market soon thereafter.  The invention was inspired by the Savery [[steam pump]] invented by [[Thomas Savery]]. Around the turn of the century, it was a popular and effective pump for [[quarry]] pumping.

== Construction and operation ==
This extremely simple pump was made of [[cast iron]], and had no [[piston]]s, rods, [[Hydraulic cylinder|cylinders]], [[Crank (mechanism)|cranks]], or [[flywheel]]s.  It operated by the direct action of [[steam]] on [[water]].  The mechanism consisted of two chambers.  As the steam condensed in one chamber, it acted as a [[suction]] pump, while in the other chamber, steam was introduced under pressure and so it acted as a force pump.  At the end of every stroke, a [[ball valve]] consisting of a small [[brass]] ball moved slightly, causing the two chambers to swap functions from suction-pump to force-pump and vice versa.  The result was that the water was first suction pumped and then force pumped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good explanation can be found in the 1901 article [[Pulsometer pump#analysis|referenced below]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;The operation of the pulsometer is as follows: The ball being at the entrance of the left-hand chamber, and the right-hand being full of water, steam enters, pressing on the surface of the water, and forcing it out through the discharge passage. A rapid condensation of steam occurs from contact with the water and with the walls of the chamber, previously cooled by the water. When the water level has reached the horizontal edge of the discharge passage, a large volume of steam suddenly escapes and is at once condensed by the relatively cold water between the chamber and the discharge valve. The pressure in the chamber quickly decreases; it cannot be sustained by steam from the boiler, for, in accordance with the inventor's first specifications, the steam pipe is small. If now the pressure in the left chamber is equal, or nearly equal, to that in the right, friction caused by the rapid flow of steam past the ball will draw the ball over and close the right-hand chamber. Cut off from further supply, the steam, in contact with water, begins to condense; a jet of cold water from the discharge pipe spurts up through the injection tube, and by breaking into spray against the side of the steam space, completes the condensation. The partial vacuum produced brings water through the suction valve to fill the chamber; but at the same time the air valve admits a little air, which passes up ahead of the water and forms an elastic cushion to prevent the water from striking violently against the steam ball. The air chamber is for the purpose of preventing water-hammer in the suction pipe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Advantages ==
The pump ran automatically without attendance.  It was praised for its "extreme simplicity of construction, operation, compact form, high efficiency, economy, durability, and adaptability". Later designs were improved upon to enhance efficiency and to make the machine more accessible for inspection and repairs, thus reducing maintenance costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== {{anchor|analysis}}Detailed analysis ==

In the January 1901 issue of ''Technology Quarterly and Proceedings of the Society of Arts'', an article appeared by Joseph C. Riley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riley|first=Joseph C.|title=The Pulsometer Steam Pump|journal=Technology Quarterly and Proceedings of the Society of Arts|date=January 1901|volume=14|series=8|pages=243–254|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BxNAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;authuser=0&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA243|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing key operational details and technical evaluation of the pulsometer pump's performance. Riley noted that although somewhat inefficient, the pulsometer's simplicity and robust construction made it well suited to pumping "thick liquids or semi-fluids, such as heavy syrups, or even liquid mud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riley|first=Joseph C.|title=The Pulsometer Steam Pump|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BxNAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;authuser=0&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pulsometer Engineering Company Limited ==
Pulsometer Engineering Company Limited was founded in Britain in 1875 after a British engineer bought the patent rights of the pulsometer pump from Thomas Hall. In 1901 the company moved from [[London]] to [[Reading, Berkshire]]. In 1961 Pulsometer merged with Sigmund Pumps of [[Gateshead]] to form Sigmund Pulsometer Pumps (SPP) and became one of the largest pump company's in Europe. SPP Ltd is now part of [[Kirloskar Brothers Ltd]].

'''Ruthenium borides''' are compounds of [[ruthenium]] and [[boron]]. Their most remarkable property is potentially high hardness. [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers hardness]] H&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; = 50 GPa was reported for thin films composed of RuB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ru&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; phases.&lt;ref&gt;J.V. Rau et al. "Deposition and characterization of superhard biphasic ruthenium boride films" [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2008.10.009 Acta Materialia 57 (2009) 673]&lt;/ref&gt; This value is significantly higher than those of bulk RuB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or Ru&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, but it has to be confirmed independently, as measurements on superhard materials are intrinsically difficult. For example, note that the initial report on extreme hardness of related material [[rhenium diboride]]&lt;ref name="Chung"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chung|first=Hsiu-Ying|date=April 20, 2007|title=Synthesis of Ultra-Incompressible Superhard Rhenium Diboride at Ambient Pressure|journal=Science|volume=316|issue=5823|pages=436–9|doi=10.1126/science.1139322|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/316/5823/436|pmid=17446399|bibcode = 2007Sci...316..436C |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; was probably too optimistic.&lt;ref&gt;J.

==Structure==
Ruthenium diboride was first thought to have a hexagonal structure,&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Kempter and R. J. Fries "Crystallography of the Ru-B and Os-B Systems" [http://link.aip.org/link/?JCPSA6/34/1994/1 J. Chem. Phys. 34, 1994 (1961)]&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[rhenium diboride]], but it was later tentatively determined to possess an [[orthorhombic]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Roof, Jr. and C. P. Kempter "New Orthorhombic Phase in the Ru-B and Os-B Systems" [http://link.aip.org/link/?JCPSA6/37/1473/1 J. Chem. Phys. 37, 1473 (1962)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7704">'''Salter's duck''', also known as the '''nodding duck''' or by its official name the '''Edinburgh duck''', is a device that converts [[wave power]] into electricity. The wave impact induces rotation of [[gyroscope]]s located inside a pear-shaped "duck", and an [[electrical generator]] converts this rotation into electricity with an overall efficiency of up to 90%. The Salter's duck was invented by [[Stephen Salter]] in response to the oil shortage in the 1970s and was one of the earliest generator designs proposed to the Wave Energy program in the [[United Kingdom]]. The funding for the project was cut off in the early 1980s after oil prices rebounded and the UK government moved away from alternative energy sources. As of May 2018 no wave-power devices have ever gone into large-scale production.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/node/11482565&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As a result of the [[1973 oil crisis]], Salter set about creating a source of [[alternative energy]]. The idea for creating Salter's duck came about from his studies on a lavatory cistern while at [[Edinburgh University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Moss |date=Feb 4, 1982 |title=Wave power team's braced for government's decision |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume=93 |issue=1291 |pages=308 |publisher=Reed Business Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XQwcxTIERmUC&amp;pg=PA308|accessdate=May 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He invented Salter's duck in 1974 and attempted to make it the main device of choice for the Wave Energy program in the [[United Kingdom]]. A prototype attempt to use the device was constructed in 1976 off [[Dores|Dores Beach]]. It was to be used to "provide some 20 kw of power".&lt;ref name="Loch"&gt;{{cite journal |date=Nov 18, 1976 |title=Nodding duck to take a bow on Loch Ness |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume=72 |issue=1027 |page=387 |publisher=Reed Business Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_bJmEOXKbkC&amp;pg=PA387|accessdate=May 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was modified slightly from the original design and Coventry University, which helped with the design, went on to utilize a separate type that was called the Sea Clam.&lt;ref name="Energies"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ocean energies: environmental, economic, and technological aspects of alternative power sources |last=Charlier |first=Roger Henri |author2=John R.

However, because of the [[1980s oil glut]], the perceived need for immediate alternative energy sources declined and, in 1982, the Wave Energy program was disbanded. This ended the hope of having Salter's duck become a mainstay in the alternative energy campaign.&lt;ref name="Age"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Hydrogen Age: Empowering a Clean-Energy Future |last=Holland |first=Geoffrey |author2=James J. Provenzano  |year=2008 |publisher=Gibbs Smith |isbn=1-58685-786-X|page=144 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6lp-N7kDwwC&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After later investigation, it was discovered that the Energy Technology Support Unit's cost determinations  had mis-estimated the cost of building Salter's duck by more than double the actual cost. The Energy Technology Support Unit&lt;ref&gt;"In 1996, ETSU became part of [[AEA Technology]] which was separated from the UKAEA by privatisation." (http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=63868&amp;CATLN=3&amp;accessmethod=5&amp;j=1#top The National Archive], UK); in turn AEA Technology has divested itself of all of the nuclear-related elements as  non-core businesses (Wikipedia: [[AEA Technology]]).&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 1974 as an agency on behalf of the Department of Energy; though its function was to manage research programmes on [[renewable energy]] and energy conservation, it was operated by the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]]. Cost considerations based on the findings were among the main factors in the duck's not being put into widespread production under the Wave Energy program in the late 1970s. The other major factor was that a consulting firm{{Who|date=May 2011}} tasked with distributing government grants passed over the 9.5 million pounds that had been allocated to Salter's research and the improvement of Salter's duck, so the funds were never actually granted to Salter and his group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1990 |title=Salter's duck |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume=128 |issue=1737–42 |pages=26 |publisher=IPC Magazines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SvxAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Salter's+duck%22&amp;dq=%22Salter's+duck%22 |accessdate=May 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From this revelation and with the increase in research into alternative energy in the 2000s, Salter's duck has begun to be used as a part of wave energy research in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Age"/&gt;

==Design==
The original prototype of Salter's duck was made of "a string of floating vanes of rudimentary duck cross-sections linked through a central spine". The string itself had 12 ducks attached to it that were "50 cm wide mounted on a spine 27 cm in diameter and 6 m long." It was made at [[Coventry University]], with materials from Ready Made Concrete and Insituform.&lt;ref name="Loch"/&gt; The final design worked by having 20 to 30 ducks connected together by the jointed spine, with each duck moving with the waves that hit it and transferring the energy of the impact to "six to ten pumps" for each duck.&lt;ref name="Energies"/&gt; The pear shape of the ducks have them facing the waves due to the decided orientation of their spine so that they rock and turn over when a wave hits them. This causes four gyroscopes inside to move back and forth, creating hydraulic energy that is transferred to a turbine or generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Growing up with science: virus, computer-zoology, Volume 16 |last=Marshall Cavendish Corporation |year=2006 |publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|page=1982|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmfLP3AbMxkC&amp;pg=PA1982 |accessdate=May 21, 2011 |isbn=978-0-7614-7521-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
In order to determine the efficiency of energy output from Salter's duck, in 1975, scientist Swift-Hook and others ran a series of tests. The optimum range of the ducks was determined according to the formula,

&lt;math&gt;0.16 &lt; \frac{r}{\lambda} &lt; 0.2&lt;/math&gt;

The use of a lowercase r in this formula indicates the back radius of the ducks. They also had to test for the incidence energy (R) given off by a submerged surface (s), the formula of which is,

&lt;math&gt;\text {R}\,\! = \int\limits_{}^{} \big(\upsilon_n - \mathit{u_n} \big)^2 \text {ds}\,\! \int\limits_{}^{} \mathit{u_n} ^2 \text {ds}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In this formula, the v stands for body velocity and the u for unperturbed fluid velocity perpendicular to the surface. With this, they were able to then use the final formula that tested for the absorption efficiency, [[eta]] (n),

&lt;math&gt;\eta = \big( 1- \mathit{R}_{min} \big) \times 1 \big(\frac{- 4 \pi d}{\lambda} \big)&lt;/math&gt;

The use of these three formulas allowed Swift-Hook to determine that Salter's duck is able to convert "90% of the wave energy into mechanical energy". However, this percentage was lower when the duck was tested in a laboratory. In varying types of realistic conditions, the efficiency of the duck varies wildly and often drops to around 50%, as ducks are more often used in rough weather in order to convert enough wave power. Conversely, ducks are not useful in calm weather, as the waves would not have enough energy for there to be any efficiency in converting it.&lt;ref name="Energies"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6824">'''Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis''' (SHS) is a method for producing both [[inorganic compounds|inorganic]] and [[organic compounds|organic]] compounds by [[combustion]]-like exothermic reactions in solids of different nature.&lt;ref&gt;"Concise Encyclopedia of Self-Propagating High-Temperature Synthesis.

If the reactants, intermediates, and products are all solids, it is known as a solid flame&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mukasyan|first = Alexander S.|last2 = Shuck|first2 =Christopher E.|last3 = Pauls |first3 = Joshua M|last4 = Manukyan|first4 = Khachatur V.|date = 2018-12-02|title =The Solid Flame Phenomenon: A Novel Perspective|url = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adem.201701065|journal=Advanced Engineering Materials||doi = 10.1016/j.cej.2011.09.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since the process occurs at high temperatures, the method is ideally suited for the production of refractory materials with unusual properties, for example: powders, metallic alloys, or ceramics with high purity, corrosion–resistance at high–temperature or super-hardnessity.

The modern SHS process was reported and patented in 1971,&lt;ref name="Merzhanov"&gt;"''Self-propagated high-temperature synthesis of refractory inorganic compounds''", A.G. Merzhanov, I.P. Borovinskaya. Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR, Vol. 204, N 2, pp. 366-369, May, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USSR Patent No. 255221, Byull. Izobr. No. 10&lt;/ref&gt; although some SHS-like processes were known previously.

==Methodology==
In its usual format, SHS is conducted starting from finely powdered reactants that are intimately mixed.  In some cases, the reagents are finely powdered whereas in other cases, they are [[Sintering|sintered]] to minimize their surface area and prevent uninitiated exothermic reactions, which can be dangerous.&lt;ref name=Kaner/&gt; In other cases, the particles are [[Mechanical Activation|mechanically activated]] through techniques such as high energy [[ball milling]] (e.g. in a planetary mill), which results in [[nanocomposite]] particles that contain both reactants within individual chemical cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mukasyan|first = Alexander S.|last2 = Khina|first2 = Boris B.|last3 = Reeves|first3 = Robert V.|last4 = Son|first4 = Steven F.|date = 2011-11-01|title = Mechanical activation and gasless explosion: Nanostructural aspects|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894711010862|journal = Chemical Engineering Journal|volume = 174|issue = 2–3|pages = 677–686|doi = 10.1016/j.cej.2011.09.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Shuck|first = Christopher E.|last2 = Manukyan|first2 = Khachatur V.|last3 = Rouvimov|first3 = Sergei|last4 = Rogachev|first4 = Alexander S.|last5 = Mukasyan|first5 = Alexander S.|date = 2016-01-01|title = Solid-flame: Experimental validation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010218015003818|journal = Combustion and Flame|volume = 163|pages = 487–493|doi = 10.1016/j.combustflame.2015.10.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reactant preparation, synthesis is initiated by point-heating of a small part (usually the top) of the sample. Once started, a wave of exothermic reaction sweeps through the remaining material. SHS has also been conducted with thin films, liquids, gases, powder–liquid systems, gas suspensions, layered systems, gas-gas systems, and others.  Reactions have been conducted in a vacuum and under both inert or reactive gases.  The temperature of the reaction can be moderated by the addition of inert salt that absorbs heat in the process of melting or evaporation, such as [[sodium chloride]], or by adding "chemical oven"—a highly exothermic mixture—to decrease the ratio of cooling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kurbatkina|first1=Viktoria|last2=Patsera|first2=Evgeny|last3=Levashov|first3= Evgeny|last4=Vorotilo|first4=Stepan|title=SHS Processing and Consolidation of Ta–Ti–C, Ta–Zr–C, and Ta–Hf–C Carbides for Ultra‐High‐Temperatures Application|journal=Advanced Engineering Materials|date=2018|doi=10.1002/adem.201701065|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.201701075}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.

==Examples==
The reaction of alkali metal [[chalcogenide]]s (S, Se, Te) and [[pnictide]]s (N, P, As) with other metal halides produce the corresponding metal chalcogenides and pnictides.&lt;ref&gt;Richard G. Blair, Richard B. Kaner "Solid-State Metathesis Materials Synthesis" http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/sigma-aldrich/technical-documents/articles/chemfiles/solid-state-metathesis.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The synthesis of [[gallium nitride]] from [[gallium triiodide]] and [[lithium nitride]] is illustrative:
:GaI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N   →  GaN  +  3 LiI
The process is so exothermic (ΔH = -515 kJ/mol) that the LiI evaporates, leaving a residue of GaN.  With GaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in place of GaI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the reaction is so exothermic that the product GaN decomposes.  Thus, the selection of the metal halide affects the success of the method.

Other compounds prepared by this method include metal dichalcogenides such as [[molybdenum disulfide|MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].  The reaction is conducted in a [[stainless steel]] reactor with excess Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref name=Kaner&gt;Philippe R. Bonneau, John B. Wiley, Richard B. Kaner "Metathetical Precursor Route to Molybdenum Disulfide" Inorganic Syntheses 1995, vol. 30, pp. 33–37. {{DOI|10.1002/9780470132616.ch8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis can also be conducted at artificial high gravity environment to control the phase composition of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yin|first1=Xi|last2=Chen|first2=Kexin|last3=Ning|first3=Xiaoshan|last4=Zhou|first4=Heping|title=Combustion Synthesis of Ti3SiC2/TiC Composites from Elemental Powders under High-Gravity Conditions|journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society|date=2010|volume=93|issue=8|pages=2182–2187|doi=10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03714.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03714.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Four solaire 001.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The [[Odeillo solar furnace|solar furnace at Odeillo]] in the [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] in [[France]] can reach temperatures up to {{convert|3500|C|F}}]]

A '''solar furnace''' is a structure that uses [[concentrated solar power]] to produce high temperatures, usually for industry. [[Parabolic mirror]]s or [[heliostat]]s concentrate [[light]] ([[Insolation]]) onto a [[focus (optics)|focal point]].  The temperature at the focal point may reach {{convert|3500|C|F}}, and this heat can be used to generate [[electricity]], melt [[steel]], make [[hydrogen fuel]] or [[nanomaterials]].

The largest solar furnace is at [[Odeillo solar furnace|Odeillo]] in the [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] in [[France]], opened in 1970.  It employs an array of plane mirrors to gather sunlight, reflecting it onto a larger curved mirror.

== History ==

The [[ancient Greek]] / [[Latin]] term ''heliocaminus'' literally means "solar furnace" and refers to a [[glass]]-enclosed [[sunroom]] intentionally designed to become hotter than the outside air temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng-forum.com/articles/Glossaries/Architecture_Roman.htm MEEF Roman Architectural Glossary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Punic War]] (218 - 202 BC), the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] [[scientist]] [[Archimedes]] is said to have repelled the attacking [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ships by setting them on fire with a "[[burning glass]]" that may have been an array of mirrors.  An experiment to test this theory was carried out by a group at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 2005.  It concluded that although the theory was sound for stationary objects, the mirrors would not likely have been able to concentrate sufficient [[solar energy]] to set a ship on fire under battle conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www//experiments/deathray/10_ArchimedesResult.html 2.009 Product Engineering Processes: Archimedes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first modern solar furnace is believed to have been built in France in 1949 by Professor Félix Trombe.  It is now still in place at [[Mont-Louis Solar Furnace|Mont Louis]], near Odeillo.  The Pyrenees were chosen as the site because the area experiences clear skies up to 300 days a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promes.cnrs.fr/ Odeillo Solar Furnace official website], retrieved 12 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Another solar furnace was built in Uzbekistan as a part of a Soviet Union "Sun" Complex Research Facility impulsed by Academician S.A. Asimov.&lt;ref&gt;[http://englishrussia.com/2012/01/25/the-solar-furnace-of-uzbekistan/#more-88701 English Russia's post about the Uzbekistan Soviet Solar Furnace]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

The rays are focused onto an area the size of a cooking pot and can reach {{convert|4000|C|F}}, depending on the process installed, for example:

* about {{convert|1000|C|F}} for metallic receivers producing hot air for the next generation solar towers as it will be tested at the [[Themis (solar power plant)|Themis plant]] with the Pegase project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promes.cnrs.fr/pegase/index.php PEGASE project home page]&lt;/ref&gt;
* about {{convert|1400|C|F}} to produce hydrogen by cracking methane molecules&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pre.ethz.ch/research/projects/?id=solhycarb SOLHYCARB, EU funded project, ETHZ official page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313121601/http://www.pre.ethz.ch/research/projects/?id=solhycarb |date=2009-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* up to {{convert|2500|C|F}} to test materials for extreme environment such as nuclear reactors or space vehicle atmospheric reentry
* up to {{convert|3500|C|F}} to produce [[nanomaterials]] by solar induced [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] and controlled cooling, such as [[carbon nanotube]]s&lt;ref&gt;Flamant G., Luxembourg D., Robert J.F., Laplaze D., Optimizing fullerene synthesis in a 50 kW solar reactor, (2004) Solar Energy, 77 (1), pp. 73-80.&lt;/ref&gt; or zinc nanoparticles&lt;ref&gt;T. Ait Ahcene, C. Monty, J. Kouam, A. Thorel, G. Petot-Ervas, A. Djemel, Preparation by solar physical vapor deposition (SPVD) and nanostructural study of pure and Bi doped ZnO nanopowders, Journal of the European Ceramic Society, Volume 27, Issue 12, 2007, Pages 3413-342&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that solar furnaces could be used in [[Space manufacturing#Manufacturing|space]] to provide energy for manufacturing purposes.

Their reliance on sunny weather is a limiting factor as a source of [[renewable energy]] on [[Earth]] but could be tied to [[thermal energy storage]] systems for energy production through these periods and into the night.

A '''solar inverter''' or '''PV inverter''', is a type of electrical '''converter''' which converts the variable [[direct current]] (DC) output of a [[photovoltaic]] (PV) [[solar panel]] into a [[utility frequency]] [[alternating current]] (AC) that can be fed into a commercial electrical [[utility grid|grid]] or used by a local, [[off-grid]] electrical network. It is a critical [[balance of system]] (BOS)–component in a [[photovoltaic system]], allowing the use of ordinary AC-powered equipment. Solar [[power inverter]]s have special functions adapted for use with photovoltaic arrays, including [[maximum power point tracking]] and anti-[[islanding]] protection.

== Classification ==

Solar inverters may be classified into three broad types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3 Types of Solar Inverters Explained|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/3-types-of-solar-inverters-explained|website=do it yourself|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Stand-alone inverter]]s''', used in isolated systems where the inverter draws its DC energy from batteries charged by photovoltaic arrays. Many stand-alone inverters also incorporate integral [[battery charger]]s to replenish the battery from an [[Alternating current|AC]] source, when available. Normally these do not interface in any way with the utility grid, and as such, are not required to have [[Islanding|anti-islanding protection]].
# '''[[Grid-tie inverter]]s''', which match [[phase (waves)|phase]] with a utility-supplied [[sine wave]]. Grid-tie inverters are designed to shut down automatically upon loss of utility supply, for safety reasons. They do not provide backup power during utility outages.
# '''Battery backup inverters''', are special inverters which are designed to draw energy from a battery, manage the battery charge via an onboard charger, and export excess energy to the utility grid. These inverters are capable of supplying AC energy to selected loads during a utility outage, and are required to have anti-islanding protection.{{clarify |date=June 2017 |reason="anti-islanding" appears to conflict with [[islanding]] definition 'designed to supply power to the grid are generally required to have some sort of automatic anti-islanding circuitry '}}

== Maximum power point tracking ==
{{main|Maximum power point tracker}}
Solar inverters use ''maximum power point tracking'' (MPPT) to get the maximum possible power from the PV array.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=invert-your-thinking-squeezing-more-2009-08-26|title=Invert your thinking: Squeezing more power out of your solar panels|publisher=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=2011-06-09|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar cell]]s have a complex relationship between solar irradiation, temperature and total resistance that produces a non-linear output efficiency known as the ''I-V curve''. It is the purpose of the MPPT system to sample the output of the cells and determine a resistance (load) to obtain maximum power for any given environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.ece.illinois.edu/chapman/papers/EC%202006%20in%20press.pdf Comparison of Photovoltaic Array Maximum Power Point Tracking Techniques] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709162832/http://energy.ece.illinois.edu/chapman/papers/EC%202006%20in%20press.pdf |date=2010-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fill factor (solar cell)|fill factor]], more commonly known by its abbreviation ''FF'', is a parameter which, in conjunction with the open circuit voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;) and short circuit current (I&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;) of the panel, determines the maximum power from a solar cell. Fill factor is defined as the ratio of the maximum power from the solar cell to the product of V&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benanti|first=Travis L.|author2=Venkataraman, D. |title=Organic Solar Cells: An Overview Focusing on Active Layer Morphology|journal=Photosynthesis Research|date=25 April 2005|volume=87|issue=1|page=77|doi=10.1007/s11120-005-6397-9|url=http://people.umass.edu/dv/pdf/OSC_REVIEW.pdf|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main types of [[Maximum power point tracker#Classification|MPPT algorithms]]: perturb-and-observe, incremental conductance and constant voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itee.uq.edu.au/~aupec/aupec06/htdocs/content/pdf/165.pdf|title=Evaluation of Micro Controller Based Maximum Power Point Tracking Methods Using dSPACE Platform|publisher=itee.uq.edu.au|accessdate=2011-06-14|work=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726191244/http://itee.uq.edu.au/~aupec/aupec06/htdocs/content/pdf/165.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two methods are often referred to as ''hill climbing'' methods; they rely on the curve of power plotted against voltage rising to the left of the maximum power point, and falling on the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/pip.459|title=Comparative Study of Maximum Power Point Tracking Algorithms|publisher=|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solar micro-inverters ==
{{main|Solar micro-inverter}}
[[File:Enphase M190.jpg|thumb|right|A solar micro-inverter in the process of being installed. The ground wire is attached to the lug and the panel's DC connections are attached to the cables on the lower right. The AC parallel trunk cable runs at the top (just visible).]]

Solar micro-inverter is an inverter designed to operate with a single PV module. The micro-inverter converts the [[direct current]] output from each panel into [[alternating current]]. Its design allows parallel connection of multiple, independent units in a modular way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/61308/702674669.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715021340/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/61308/702674669.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micro-inverter advantages include single panel power optimization, independent operation of each panel, plug-and play installation, improved installation and fire safety, minimized costs with system design and stock minimization.

A 2011 study at Appalachian State University reports that individual integrated inverter setup yielded about 20% more power in unshaded conditions and 27% more power in shaded conditions compared to string connected setup using one inverter. Both setups used identical solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON OF MICRO AND CENTRAL INVERTERS IN SHADED AND UNSHADED CONDITIONS|url=http://tec.appstate.edu/sites/tec.appstate.edu/files/micro%20vs%20central%20inverters%20shaded%20vs%20unshaded%20dave%20lee%20raichle.pdf|accessdate=27 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714205618/http://tec.appstate.edu/sites/tec.appstate.edu/files/micro%20vs%20central%20inverters%20shaded%20vs%20unshaded%20dave%20lee%20raichle.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grid tied solar inverters ==
{{See also|Grid-tie inverter}}
Solar grid-tie inverters are designed to quickly disconnect from the grid if the [[utility grid]] goes down. This is an [[National Electrical Code|NEC]] requirement that ensures that in the event of a blackout, the grid tie inverter will shut down to prevent the energy it produces from harming any line workers who are sent to fix the [[power grid]].

Grid-tie inverters that are available on the market today use a number of different technologies. The inverters may use the newer high-frequency [[transformer]]s, conventional low-frequency [[transformer]]s, or no transformer. Instead of converting direct current directly to 120 or 240&amp;nbsp;volts AC, high-frequency transformers employ a computerized multi-step process that involves converting the power to high-frequency AC and then back to DC and then to the final AC output voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Photovoltaics: Design and Installation Manual| last=| first=| year=2004| authorlink=Solar Energy International| page=80| publisher=Newsociety Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, there have been concerns about having transformerless electrical systems feed into the public utility grid. The concerns stem from the fact that there is a lack of [[galvanic isolation]] between the DC and AC circuits, which could allow the passage of dangerous DC faults to the AC side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/inverter_ii_workshop.pdf|title=Summary Report on the DOE High-tech Inverter Workshop|publisher=eere.energy.gov|accessdate=2011-06-10|work=Sponsored by the US Department of Energy, prepared by McNeil Technologies|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227145827/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/inverter_ii_workshop.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, the NFPA's NEC allows transformer-less (or non-galvanically) inverters. The VDE 0126-1-1 and IEC 6210 also have been amended to allow and define the safety mechanisms needed for such systems. Primarily, residual or ground current detection is used to detect possible fault conditions. Also isolation tests are performed to ensure DC to AC separation.

Many solar inverters are designed to be connected to a utility grid, and will not operate when they do not detect the presence of the grid. They contain special circuitry to precisely match the voltage, [[Utility frequency|frequency]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the grid.

== Solar pumping inverters ==
Advanced solar pumping inverters convert DC voltage from the solar array into AC voltage to drive [[submersible pump]]s directly without the need for batteries or other energy storage devices. By utilizing MPPT (maximum power point tracking), solar pumping inverters regulate output frequency to control the speed of the pumps in order to save the pump motor from damage.

Solar pumping inverters usually have multiple ports to allow the input of DC current generated by PV arrays, one port to allow the output of AC voltage, and a further port for input from a water-level sensor.

== Market ==
As of 2014, conversion efficiency for state-of-the-art solar converters reached more than 98 percent. While string inverters are used in residential to medium-sized commercial [[PV systems]], central inverters cover the large commercial and utility-scale market. Market-share for central and string inverters are about 50 percent and 48 percent, respectively, leaving less than 2 percent to micro-inverters.&lt;ref name="fraunhofer-report-september-2014" /&gt;

A '''tuned mass damper''' (TMD), also known as a '''harmonic absorber''' or '''seismic damper''', is a device mounted in structures to reduce the amplitude of mechanical [[vibration]]s. Their application can prevent discomfort, damage, or outright [[structural failure]]. They are frequently used in power transmission, automobiles, and buildings.

==Principle==

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
[[File:Spring–mass–damper system.svg|thumb|A schematic of a simple spring–mass–damper system used to demonstrate the tuned mass damper system.]]

Tuned mass dampers stabilize against violent motion caused by [[normal mode|harmonic vibration]]. A tuned damper reduces the vibration of a system with a comparatively lightweight component so that the worst-case vibrations are less intense. Roughly speaking, practical systems are tuned to either move the main mode away from a troubling excitation frequency, or to add damping to a resonance that is difficult or expensive to damp directly. An example of the latter is a crankshaft torsional damper. Mass dampers are frequently implemented with a frictional or hydraulic component that turns mechanical kinetic energy into heat, like an automotive [[shock absorber]].

Given a motor with mass &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; attached via motor mounts to the ground, the motor vibrates as it operates and the soft motor mounts act as a parallel spring and damper, &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt;. The force on the motor mounts is &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt;.  In order to reduce the maximum force on the motor mounts as the motor operates over a range of speeds, a smaller mass, &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt;, is connected to &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; by a spring and a damper, &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt; is the effective force on the motor due to its operation.

[[File:Tuned mass damper.png|thumb|left|Response of the system excited by one unit of force, with (red) and without (blue) the 10% tuned mass. The peak response is reduced from 9 units down to 5.5 units. While the maximum response force is reduced, there are some operating frequencies for which the response force is increased.]]

The graph shows the effect of a tuned mass damper on a simple spring–mass–damper system, excited by vibrations with an amplitude of one unit of force applied to the main mass, &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt;. An important measure of performance is the ratio of the force on the motor mounts to the force vibrating the motor, &lt;math&gt;F_0/F_1&lt;/math&gt;. This assumes that the system is linear, so if the force on the motor were to double, so would the force on the motor mounts. The blue line represents the baseline system, with a maximum response of 9 units of force at around 9 units of frequency. The red line shows the effect of adding a tuned mass of 10% of the baseline mass. It has a maximum response of 5.5, at a frequency of 7.  As a side effect, it also has a second normal mode and will vibrate somewhat more than the baseline system at frequencies below about 6 and above about 10. &lt;!-- These really should have units. Does someone want to work the problem out?  --&gt;

The heights of the two peaks can be adjusted by changing the stiffness of the spring in the tuned mass damper. Changing the damping also changes the height of the peaks, in a complex fashion. The split between the two peaks can be changed by altering the mass of the damper (&lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt;).

[[File:2dof plots.png|thumb|A [[Bode plot]] of displacements in the system with (red) and without (blue) the 10% tuned mass.]]
The [[Bode plot]] is more complex, showing the phase and magnitude of the motion of each mass, for the two cases, relative to F1.

In the plots at right, the black line shows the baseline response (&lt;math&gt;m_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;). Now considering &lt;math&gt;m_2 = m_1/10&lt;/math&gt;, the blue line shows the motion of the damping mass and the red line shows the motion of the primary mass. The amplitude plot shows that at low frequencies, the damping mass resonates much more than the primary mass. The phase plot shows that at low frequencies, the two masses are in phase. As the frequency increases &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; moves out of phase with &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; until at around 9.5&amp;nbsp;Hz it is 180° out of phase with &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt;, maximizing the damping effect by maximizing the amplitude of &lt;math&gt;x_2-x_1&lt;/math&gt;, this maximizes the energy dissipated into &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; and simultaneously pulls on the primary mass in the same direction as the motor mounts.

==Mass dampers in automobiles==
===Motorsport===
The tuned mass damper was introduced as part of the suspension system by Renault, on its 2005 F1 car (the [[Renault R25]]), at the [[2005 Brazilian Grand Prix]]. It was deemed to be legal at first, and it was in use up to the [[2006 German Grand Prix]].

At Hockenheim, the mass damper was deemed illegal by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]], because the mass was not rigidly attached to the chassis and, due to the influence it had on the pitch attitude of the car, which in turn significantly affected the gap under the car and hence the [[ground effect (cars)|ground effect]]s of the car, to be a movable aerodynamic device and hence as a consequence, to be illegally influencing the performance of the [[aerodynamics]].

The Stewards of the meeting deemed it legal, but the FIA appealed against that decision. Two weeks later, the FIA International Court of Appeal deemed the mass damper illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bishop | first = Matt | year = 2006 | title = The Long Interview: Flavio Briatore | journal = F1 Racing | volume =  | issue = October | pages = 66–76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitpass.com/fes_php/pitpass_news_item.php?fes_art_id=28765 |title=FIA bans controversial damper system |publisher=Pitpass.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production cars===
Tuned mass dampers are widely used in production cars, typically on the [[crankshaft]] pulley to control [[torsional vibration]] and, more rarely, the bending modes of the crankshaft. They are also used on the driveline for gearwhine, and elsewhere for other noises or vibrations on the exhaust, body, suspension or anywhere else. Almost all modern cars will have one mass damper, some may have 10 or more.

The usual design of damper on the crankshaft consists of a thin band of rubber between the hub of the pulley and the outer rim. This device, often called a [[harmonic balancer|harmonic damper]], is located on the other end of the crankshaft opposite of where the [[flywheel]] and the transmission is. An alternative design is the [[centrifugal pendulum absorber]] which is used to reduce the [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion engine's]] torsional vibrations on a few modern cars.

All four wheels of the [[Citroen 2cv]] incorporated a tuned mass damper (referred to as a "Batteur" in the original French) of very similar design to that used in the Renault F1 car, from the start of production in 1949 on all four wheels, before being removed from the rear and eventually the front wheels in the mid 1970s.

==Mass dampers in spacecraft==
One proposal to reduce vibration on NASA's [[Ares I|Ares]] solid fuel booster was to use 16 tuned mass dampers as part of a design strategy to reduce peak loads from 6g to 0.25 g, the TMDs being responsible for the reduction from 1 g to 0.25 g, the rest being done by conventional [[vibration isolation|vibration isolators]] between the upper stages and the booster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2008/12/ares-i-thrust-oscillation-meetings-encouraging-allowance-for-changes/ |title=Ares I Thrust Oscillation meetings conclude with encouraging data, changes |publisher=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=2008-12-09 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/news/080819-nasa-ares1-vibration-update.html |title=Shock Absorber Plan Set for NASA's New Rocket |publisher=SPACE.com |date=2008-08-19 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dampers in wind turbines==
A standard tuned mass damper for wind turbines consists of an auxiliary mass which is attached to the main structure by means of springs and dashpot elements. The natural frequency of the tuned mass damper is basically defined by its spring constant and the damping ratio determined by the dashpot. The tuned parameter of the tuned mass damper enables the auxiliary mass to oscillate with a phase shift with respect to the motion of the structure. In a typical configuration an auxiliary mass hung below the nacelle of a wind turbine supported by dampers or friction plates.

Typically, the [[damping|dampers]] are huge concrete blocks or steel bodies mounted in [[skyscraper]]s or other structures, and moved in opposition to the [[resonance|resonance frequency]] oscillations of the structure by means of [[spring (device)|springs]], fluid or pendulums.

===Sources of vibration and resonance===
Unwanted vibration may be caused by environmental forces acting on a structure, such as wind or earthquake, or by a seemingly innocuous vibration source causing resonance that may be destructive, unpleasant or simply inconvenient.

====Earthquakes====
The [[seismic wave]]s caused by an [[earthquake]] will make buildings sway and [[oscillate]] in various ways depending on the frequency and direction of ground motion, and the height and construction of the building. Seismic activity can cause excessive oscillations of the building which may lead to [[structural failure]]. To enhance the building's [[seismic performance]], a proper building design is performed engaging various seismic [[vibration control]] technologies.
As mentioned above, damping devices had been used in the aeronautics and automobile industries long before they were standard in mitigating seismic damage to buildings. In fact, the first specialized damping devices for earthquakes were not developed until late in 1950.&lt;ref name=Reitherman&gt;{{cite book|last=Reitherman|first=Robert|title=Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History|year=2012|publisher=ASCE Press|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410714|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726183407/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|archivedate=2012-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mechanical human sources====

Masses of people walking up and down stairs at once, or great numbers of people stomping in unison, can cause serious problems in large structures like stadiums if those structures lack damping measures.

====Wind====
The force of wind against tall buildings can cause the top of skyscrapers to move more than a meter. This motion can be in the form of swaying or twisting, and can cause the upper floors of such buildings to move. Certain angles of wind and [[aerodynamic]] properties of a building can accentuate the movement and cause [[motion sickness]] in people. A TMD is usually tuned to a certain building's frequency to work efficiently. However, during their lifetimes, high-rise and slender buildings may experience natural frequency changes under wind speed, ambient temperatures and relative humidity variations, among other factors, which requires a robust TMD design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=ALY|first=Aly Mousaad|title=Proposed robust tuned mass damper for response mitigation in buildings exposed to multidirectional wind|journal=The Structural Design of Tall and Special Buildings|year=2012|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tal.1068/abstract|doi=10.1002/tal.1068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Y and Z&amp;nbsp;Holes''' are two rings of concentric (though irregular) circuits of 30 and 29&amp;nbsp;near identical pits cut around the outside of the Sarsen Circle at [[Stonehenge]]. The current view is that both circuits are contemporary. [[Radiocarbon dating]] of antlers deliberately placed in hole Y&amp;nbsp;30 provided a date of around 1600&amp;nbsp;[[BCE]], a slightly earlier date was determined for material retrieved from Z&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;ref name=ClealEtal1995&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cleal, R. M. J. |author2=Walker, K. E. |author3=Montague, R. |title=[[Stonehenge in its landscape]] |publisher=English Heritage |location=London, U.K. |year=1995 |pp=260-264 |isbn=978-1-85074-605-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These dates make the Y and Z holes  the last known structural activity at Stonehenge.

The holes were discovered in 1923 by [[William Hawley]], who, on removing the topsoil over a wide area noted them as clearly visible patches of ‘humus’ against the chalk substrate.&lt;ref name=Hawley1923&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hawley, Lt-Col W. |year=1923 |title=Third Report on the Excavations at Stonehenge |journal=The Antiquaries Journal |volume=3 |publisher=Oxford University Press |doi=10.1017/s0003581500004558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawley named them the ‘Y’ and ‘Z’ because for a short time he had earlier labeled the recently discovered [[Aubrey Holes]] the ‘X’&amp;nbsp;holes. 18 of the Y&amp;nbsp;Holes have been excavated and 16 of the Z&amp;nbsp;Holes. Further evidence of the Y and Z&amp;nbsp;Holes being late in the sequence of events at Stonehenge is demonstrated by the fact that hole Z&amp;nbsp;7 was found to cut into the backfill of the construction ramp for stone 7 of the Sarsen Circle.

==Description==
The outer Y&amp;nbsp;ring consists of 30&amp;nbsp;holes averaging 1.7&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]] × 1.14&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]] tapering to a flat base typically close to 1&amp;nbsp;m × 0.5&amp;nbsp;m, the inner Z&amp;nbsp;holes, of which only 29&amp;nbsp;holes are known (the missing hole Z&amp;nbsp;8 may lie beneath the fallen Sarsen stone&amp;nbsp;8), are slightly larger, on average by some 0.1&amp;nbsp;m. They can be best described morphologically as ‘wedge-shaped’. The diameter of the Y&amp;nbsp;Hole circuit, i.e. the best-fit circle is some 54&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]], that of the Z&amp;nbsp;Hole series, around 39&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]]. 

The fills of the holes was found to be largely stone-free, these deposits are thought to be the result of the gradual accumulation of wind-blown material.&lt;ref&gt;Cleal, et al. (1995), p&amp;nbsp;260&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of almost every material, both natural and artefactual, that have been found elsewhere at Stonehenge have been retrieved from their fills; this includes pottery of later periods (Iron Age, Romano-British, and Medieval) also coins, horseshoe nails, and even human remains.

A new landscape investigation  of the Stonehenge site was conducted in April&amp;nbsp;2009 and a shallow bank, little more than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=in}} high, was identified between the two hole-circles. A further bank lies inside the Z&amp;nbsp;Hole circle. These are interpreted as the spread of spoil from the original holes, or more speculatively as hedge banks from vegetation deliberately planted to screen the activities within.&lt;ref name=Field2010&gt;{{cite journal |last=Field |first=David |date=March 2010 |title=Introducing Stonehenge |journal=British Archaeology |publisher=Council for British Archaeology |location=York, England |issue=111 |pp=32–35 |issn=1357-4442 |display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[File:yz sq.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The concentric relationships between the Y and Z&amp;nbsp;Holes (after Johnson, 2008)]]
Neither Hawley, nor [[Richard J.C. Atkinson|Richard Atkinson]] who investigated two of the holes (Y&amp;nbsp;16 and Z&amp;nbsp;16) in 1953 thought that there had ever been uprights of timber or stone in the holes. Atkinson however suggested that they had been intended to house [[bluestones]],&lt;ref name=Atkinson1979&gt;{{cite book |author=Atkinson, R J C. |year=1979 |title=Stonehenge |publisher=Penguin Books |page=36 |isbn=978-0-14-020450-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the question remains unresolved. Although unique in many ways, a similarity of form between these holes and the contemporary grave pits under the [[Bronze Age]] [[Tumulus|Barrow]]&amp;nbsp;mounds has been pointed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pitts, M. |year=2000 |title=Hengeworld |publisher=Arrow |location=London |page=294 |isbn=978-0-7126-7954-1 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts at interpreting the methods of construction used in building the stone monument sometimes show the Y and Z&amp;nbsp;Holes used to locate temporary scaffold–like timber structures or ‘A’&amp;nbsp;frames. The fact that the stonework has been shown to be around 700 or 800&amp;nbsp;years earlier than the Y and Z&amp;nbsp;Holes clearly precludes the possibility that the holes represent features cut for constructional purposes. For the same reason the Y and Z&amp;nbsp;Holes cannot be logically introduced into any scheme that suggests they performed a structural function  within the design of the stone monument.

Some interpretations introduce the idea that the holes were deliberately laid out in a ‘spiral’ pattern. However their irregular pattern still retains an integrity that can be explained as  reciprocal errors created by prehistoric surveyors using a cord (equal to the radius of each circuit) passed around the stone monument&lt;ref name=Jonson2008&gt;{{cite book |author=Johnson, A. |year=2008 |title=Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |pp=197–206 |isbn=978-0-500-05155-9 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
(the presence of the stones would have prevented an accurate circle from being scribed from the geometric centre of the site). The distances between the two circuits appears to have been established by the geometry of simple square and circle relationships (i.e. the Z&amp;nbsp;Hole circuit is contained within a square inscribed within the Y&amp;nbsp;Hole circuit).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 2008, p&amp;nbsp;256&lt;/ref&gt;
