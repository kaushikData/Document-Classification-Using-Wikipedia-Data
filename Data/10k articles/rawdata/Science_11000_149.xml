'''Apusiaajik Glacier''' is a tidewater [[glacier]] on the uninhabited [[Apusiaajik Island]] in the [[Sermersooq]] municipality on the southeastern shore of [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name="saga"&gt;Tasiilaq, Saga Map, Tage Schjøtt, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Tourism ==
During summer, the glacier edge is a popular tourist destination for boat trips from [[Tasiilaq]] and [[Kulusuk]].&lt;ref name="lp"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Carroll|first=Etain|title=Greenland and the Arctic|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] |pages=204–205|year=2005|isbn=1-74059-095-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During winter it is possible to reach the front of the glacier crossing the frozen [[Torsuut Tunoq]] sound on foot or on [[snowmobile]].

'''Beall's List''' was a list of [[Predatory open-access publishing|predatory open-access publishers]] maintained by University of Colorado librarian [[Jeffrey Beall]]. The list aimed to document open-access publishers who did not perform real [[peer review]], effectively publishing any article as long as the authors pay the [[open access]] fee. Originally started as a personal endeavor in 2008, Beall's List became a widely followed piece of work by the mid 2010s. Its influence led some publishers on the list to threaten defamation lawsuits against Beall, as well as lodge official complaints against Beall's work to the University of Colorado. As a result, Beall deactivated his blog and the list in January 2017.

The death of Beall's List was cited by some as a tragedy,&lt;ref name=Spears2017&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/worlds-main-list-of-science-predators-vanishes-with-no-warning |title=World's main list of 'predatory' science publishers vanishes with no warning |last=Spears |first=Tom |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |date=January 17, 2017 |access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successors have set out to continue Beall's work.

==History==
Beall first became interested in so-called predatory open-access journals (a term he coined) in 2008, when he started to receive numerous requests from dubious journals to serve on their [[editorial board]]s. He  said that he "immediately became fascinated because most of the e-mails contained numerous grammatical errors."&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Butler |first1=D. |title=Investigating journals: The dark side of publishing |doi=10.1038/495433a |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=495 |issue=7442 |pages=433–435 |year=2013 |pmid=23538810|bibcode=2013Natur.495..433B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2008, he maintained a well-known and regularly updated list of what he stated were "potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers".&lt;ref name=Beall-Publ&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeffrey |last=Beall |authorlink=Jeffrey Beall |title=Beall's List: Potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers |website=Scholarly Open Access |edition=last archived |url=http://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/ |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112125427/https://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/ |archivedate=2017-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolata2013&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/08/health/for-scientists-an-exploding-world-of-pseudo-academia.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp; |title=Scientific Articles Accepted (Personal Checks, Too) |work=[[New York Times]] |date=April 7, 2013 |accessdate=2014-01-18 |last1=Kolata |first1=Gina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jump2012&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/research/research-intelligence-predators-who-lurk-in-plain-cite/420731.article | title=Research Intelligence – 'Predators' who lurk in plain cite |work=[[Times Higher Education]] | date=August 2, 2012 | accessdate=2015-08-29 |last=Jump |first=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Beall's list had 18 publishers on it; by December 29, 2016, this number had grown to 923.&lt;ref name=Carey2016&gt;{{Cite news  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/upshot/fake-academe-looking-much-like-the-real-thing.html |title=A Peek Inside the Strange World of Fake Academia |last=Carey |first=Kevin |website=Upshot |publisher=The New York Times |publication-date=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal threats===
In February 2013, the open-access publisher Canadian Center for Science and Education sent a letter to Beall stating that Beall's inclusion of their company on his list of questionable open-access publishers amounted to defamation. The letter also stated that if Beall did not remove this company from his list, they would subject him to "civil action".&lt;ref name=Flaherty2013&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/02/15/another-publisher-accuses-librarian-libel |title=Librarians and Lawyers |work=Inside Higher Ed |date=February 15, 2013 |accessdate=2014-12-08 |last1=Flaherty |first1=Colleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[OMICS Publishing Group]] threatened to sue Beall for $1&amp;nbsp;billion for his "ridiculous, baseless, [and] impertinent" inclusion of them on his list, which "smacks of literal unprofessionalism and arrogance".&lt;ref name = JakeNew&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Publisher-Threatens-to-Sue/139243/?cid=at |title=Publisher Threatens to Sue Blogger for $1-Billion |newspaper=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=May 15, 2013 |accessdate=2016-10-22 |last=New |first=Jake}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unedited sentence from the letter read: "Let us at the outset warn you that this is a very perilous journey for you and you will be completely exposing yourself to serious legal implications including criminal cases lunched against you in INDIA and USA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/05/20/high-noon-a-publisher-threatens-to-lunch-a-criminal-case-against-librarian-critic/ |title=High Noon – A Publisher Threatens to 'Lunch' a Criminal Case Against Librarian Critic |first=Rick |last=Anderson |date=May 20, 2013 |accessdate=2016-10-24 |publisher=[[Scholarly Kitchen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beall responded that the letter was "poorly written and personally threatening" and expressed his opinion that the letter "is an attempt to detract from the enormity of OMICS's editorial practices".&lt;ref name = NPR&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/05/15/184233141/publisher-threatens-librarian-with-1-billion-lawsuit |title=Publisher Threatens Librarian With $1 Billion Lawsuit |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=May 15, 2013 |accessdate=2016-10-02 |last=Chappell |first=Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; OMICS' lawyers stated that damages were being pursued under section 66A of India's [[Information Technology Act, 2000]], which makes it illegal to use a computer to publish "any information that is grossly offensive or has menacing character" or to publish false information.&lt;ref name=IndiaToday&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/section-66a-it-act-supreme-court-bullies-censorship-rohan-venkataramakrishnan/1/271900.html |title=Send Section 66A bullies home |first=Rohan |last=Venkataramakrishnan |newspaper=[[India Today]] |date=May 19, 2013 |accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter stated that three years in prison was a possible penalty, although a U.S. lawyer said that the threats seemed to be a "publicity stunt" that was meant to "intimidate".&lt;ref name = JakeNew /&gt;

===''Who's Afraid of Peer Review?''===
{{main|Who's Afraid of Peer Review?}}
In 2013, ''Science'' correspondent [[John Bohannon]] submitted 304 fake scientific articles to various open access journals, many of which were published by publishers on Beall's List. Among these publishers that completed the review process, 82% accepted the paper. Bohannon stated "the results show that Beall is good at spotting publishers with poor quality control". Beall stated that the results support his claim to be identifying "predatory" publishers.&lt;ref name="Science Magazine Conducts Sting Operation on OA Publishers"&gt;{{cite web |last=Beall |first=Jeffrey |title=Science Magazine Conducts Sting Operation on OA Publishers |url=http://scholarlyoa.com/2013/10/03/science/ |publisher=Scholarly Open Access |accessdate=22 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012052520/http://scholarlyoa.com/2013/10/03/science/ |archivedate=12 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the remaining 18% of publishers identified by Beall as predatory rejected the fake paper, leading [[Science communication|science communicator]] Phil Davis to state "That means that Beall is falsely accusing nearly one in five".&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt;

===Removal===
On January 15, 2017, the entire content of Beall's ''Scholarly Open Access'' website was removed, along with Beall's faculty page on the University of Colorado's website.&lt;ref name=RW2017&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://retractionwatch.com/2017/01/17/bealls-list-potential-predatory-publishers-go-dark/ |title=Why did Beall's List of potential predatory publishers go dark? |website=[[Retraction Watch]] |publication-date=January 17, 2017|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal was first noticed on social media, with speculation on whether the removal was due to migration of the list to the stewardship of Cabell's International.&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; The company later denied any relationship, and its vice president of business development declared that Beall "was forced to shut down blog due to threats and politics".&lt;ref name=inside&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/18/librarians-list-predatory-journals-reportedly-removed-due-threats-and-politics|title=Librarian's list of 'predatory' journals reportedly removed due to 'threats and politics'|website=Inside Higher Ed |date=January 18, 2017 |access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Colorado also declared that the decision to take down the list was a personal decision from Beall.&lt;ref name=SinghChawla&gt;{{Cite news |first1=Dalmeet |last1=Singh Chawla |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/mystery-controversial-list-predatory-publishers-disappears |title=Mystery as controversial list of predatory publishers disappears |date=January 17, 2017 |newspaper=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beall later wrote that he had taken down his blog because of pressure from the University of Colorado, which threatened his job security.&lt;ref name=biochemia&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jeffrey|last=Beall|title=What I learned from predatory publishers|journal=Biochemia Medica|year=2017|volume=27|issue=2|pages=273–279|url=http://www.biochemia-medica.com/2017/27/273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beall's supervisor, Shea Swauger, wrote that the university had supported Beall's work and had not threatened his academic freedom.&lt;ref name=Swauger2017&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Swauger |first=Shea |title=Open access, power, and privilege: A response to 'What I learned from predatory publishing' |journal=College &amp; Research Libraries News |volume=78 |issue=11 |pages=603–606 |date=December 1, 2017 |doi=10.5860/crln.78.11.603}}&lt;/ref&gt; A demand by [[Frontiers Media]] to open a research misconduct case against Beall, to which the University of Colorado acquiesced, is reported as the immediate reason for Beall to take down the list. The university's investigation was closed with no findings.&lt;ref name=Basken2017a&gt;{{cite journal |title=Why Beall's List Died — and What It Left Unresolved About Open Access |first=Paul |last=Basken |journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=September 12, 2017 |url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Beall-s-List-Died-/241171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Basken2017b&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Beall's blacklist of predatory journals died |first=Paul |last=Basken |newspaper=University World News |date=September 22, 2017|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20170920150122306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beall has not reactivated the list.

===Successors===

==Criteria for inclusion==
Beall applied a diverse set of criteria before including a publisher or journal on his lists. Examples included:&lt;ref name=Beall-Crit&gt;{{cite web |title=Criteria for Determining Predatory Open-Access Publishers |first=Jeffrey |last=Beall |date=January 1, 2015 |website=Scholarly Open Access |url=https://scholarlyoa.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/criteria-2015.pdf |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130184313/https://scholarlyoa.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/criteria-2015.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two or more journals have duplicate editorial boards (''i.e.'', same editorial board for more than one journal).
* There is little or no geographical diversity among the editorial board members, especially for journals that claim to be international in scope or coverage.
* The publisher has no policies or practices for digital preservation, meaning that if the journal ceases operations, all of the content disappears from the internet.
* The publisher copy-proofs (locks) their PDFs, thus making it harder to check for plagiarism.
* The name of a journal is incongruent with the journal's mission.
* The publisher falsely claims to have its content indexed in legitimate abstracting and indexing services or claims that its content is indexed in resources that are not abstracting and indexing services.

==Criticism==
The list's 82% accuracy rate in the ''[[Who's Afraid of Peer Review?]]'' sting operation led Phil Davis to state that "Beall is falsely accusing nearly one in five as being a 'potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open access publisher' on appearances alone."&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Davis |first1=Phil |title=Open Access "Sting" Reveals Deception, Missed Opportunities |url=https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/10/04/open-access-sting-reveals-deception-missed-opportunities/ |website=[[The Scholarly Kitchen]] |date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that Beall "should reconsider listing publishers on his 'predatory' list until he has evidence of wrongdoing. Being mislabeled as a 'potential, possible, or probable predatory publisher' by circumstantial evidence alone is like the sheriff of a Wild West town throwing a cowboy into jail just 'cuz he's a little funny lookin.' Civility requires due process."&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

Joseph Esposito wrote in ''[[The Scholarly Kitchen]]'' that he had been following some of Beall's work with "growing unease",&lt;ref name="Esposito"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Esposito |first1=Joseph |title=Parting Company with Jeffrey Beall |url=https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/12/16/parting-company-with-jeffrey-beall/ |website=[[The Scholarly Kitchen]] |date=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Beall's "broader critique (really an assault) of Gold OA and those who advocate it" had "crossed the line".&lt;ref name="Esposito"/&gt;

[[City University of New York]] librarians Monica Berger and Jill Cirasella wrote that his views were biased against open-access journals from less economically developed countries.&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt; Berger and Cirasella argued that "imperfect English or a predominantly non-Western editorial board does not make a journal predatory".&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Monica |last1=Berger |first2=Jill |last2=Cirasella |title=Beyond Beall's List: Better Understanding Predatory Publishers |journal=[[College &amp; Research Libraries News]] |volume=76 |issue=3 |date=2015 |pages=132–135 |url=http://crln.acrl.org/content/76/3/132.long |accessdate=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that "the criteria he uses for his list are an excellent starting point for thinking about the hallmarks of predatory publishers and journals,"&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt; and suggested that "given the fuzziness between low-quality and predatory publishers, whitelisting, or listing publishers and journals that have been vetted and verified as satisfying certain standards, may be a better solution than blacklisting."&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt;

Rick Anderson, associate dean in the [[J. Willard Marriott Library]], [[University of Utah]], challenged the term "predatory open access publishing" itself: "what do we mean when we say 'predatory,' and is that term even still useful?... This question has become relevant because of that common refrain heard among Beall's critics: that he only examines one kind of predation—the kind that naturally crops up in the context of author-pays OA."&lt;ref name=Anderson2015/&gt; Anderson suggested that the term "predatory" be retired in the context of scholarly publishing: "It's a nice, attention-grabbing word, but I'm not sure it's helpfully descriptive... it generates more heat than light."&lt;ref name=Anderson2015/&gt; In its place, he proposed the term "deceptive publishing".&lt;ref name=Anderson2015&gt;{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Rick |date=May 11, 2015 |url=https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/05/11/should-we-retire-the-term-predatory-publishing/ |title=Should We Retire the Term 'Predatory Publishing'? |website=[[The Scholarly Kitchen]] |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">The '''Bocas del Toro Research Station'''  (BRS) is a field station of the [[Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute]] (STRI) on [[Panama]]’s western [[Caribbean]] coast, is a platform for both [[marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] [[biodiversity]] research. The station hosts a diverse group of scientists from more than 20 countries, every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stri.org/english/research/facilities/marine/bocas_del_toro/index.php |title=Facilities :: Bocas del Toro Research Station |publisher=Stri.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities at the station contribute to the Smithsonian Institution’s primary mission: the increase and diffusion of knowledge. Visiting scientists are engaged in research on the biodiversity, [[ecology]], [[paleontology]] and [[archaeology]] of the Bocas del Toro region. Educational and outreach activities range from hosting K-12 school groups, to specialized training for international graduate students. 

Founded in 1998, the BRS campus has provided field accommodation since 2002 and a fully operational research laboratory since 2003. The facilities now include a running seawater system, a new dock, boat ramp, and additional support facilities, as well as two houses to accommodate visiting researchers. The BRS is arguably the preeminent field station in the Caribbean.
Visiting scientists hold lectures that are open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapefromamerica.com/2009/03/learn-spanish-in-bocas-del-toro-panama/ |title=Be an Eco-Volunteer or Learn Spanish in Bocas del Toro, Panama &amp;#124; EFAM &amp;#124; Escape From America Magazine |publisher=Escapefromamerica.com |date=2009-05-09 |accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outreach, Education and Training ==
Outreach and education at the Bocas del Toro Research Station spans a range of programs targeting K-12 students, university undergraduates, graduate students and young professionals. K-12 education includes visits to local schools, some of which are in remote mountainous locations, and student visits to the BRS. The station also offers a training workshop for local K-12 teachers every year, an organized beach clean-up for Earth day, and other activities for local residents.

They hold an annual Environmental Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_15/issue_10/nature_01.html |title=Environmental Fair at the Smithsonian's Bocas del Toro Research Station |publisher=Thepanamanews.com |date=2009-06-08 |accessdate=2010-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614103153/http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_15/issue_10/nature_01.html |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2349">In physics, a '''characteristic length''' is an important dimension that defines the scale of a physical system.  Often, such a length is used as an input to a formula in order to predict some characteristics of the system.

Examples:
* [[Reynolds Number]]
* [[Biot number]]
* [[Nusselt number]]

In computational mechanics, a '''characteristic length''' is defined to force localization of a stress softening constitutive equation. The length is associated with an integration point. For 2D analysis, it is calculated by taking square root of the area. For 3D analysis, it is calculated by taking cubic root of the volume associated to the integration point.&lt;ref&gt;J. Oliver, M. Cervera, S. Oller, Isotropic damage models and smeared crack analysis of concrete. Proceedings of SCI-C 1990 (1990) 945–958.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculation ==
The general formula for the characteristic length is the volume of a system divided by its surface&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fxsolver.com/browse/formulas/Characteristic+Length|title=Characteristic Length - calculator |website=fxSolver |access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;L_c = V_{body}/A_{surface}&lt;/math&gt;

A typical use-case is calculating flow through circular and non-circular tubes, in order to examine flow conditions (i.e. the Reynolds number). In those cases, the characteristic length is the diameter of the pipe, or in case of non-circular tubes its hydraulic diameter &lt;math&gt;D_h&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;D_h=4A_c/p&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;A_c&lt;/math&gt;is the cross-sectional area of the pipe and p its wetted perimeter. It is defined such that it reduces to a circular diameter of D for circular pipes.

For flow through a square duct with a side length of a, the hydraulic diameter &lt;math&gt;D_h&lt;/math&gt;is:

&lt;math&gt;D_h=4a^2/4a=a&lt;/math&gt;

For a rectangular duct with side lengths a and b:

&lt;math&gt;D_h=\frac{4ab}{2(a+b)}=\frac{2ab}{a+b}&lt;/math&gt;

For free surfaces (such as in open-channel flow), the wetted perimeter includes only the walls in contact with the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fluid mechanics : fundamentals and applications |last=Çengel |first=Yunus A. |last2=Cimbala |first2=John M. |isbn=9780073380322 |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2014 |oclc=880405759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Doping in sport sidebar|expanded=History}}

This article is about the history of competitors at the [[Olympic Games]] using banned [[ergogenic aid|athletic performance-enhancing drugs]].

== History ==
The use of performance-enhancing tactics or more formally known as PEDs, and more broadly, the use of any external device to nefariously influence the outcome of a sporting event has been a part of the Olympics since its inception in Ancient Greece.  One speculation as to why men were required to compete naked was to prevent the use of extra accoutrements and to keep women from competing in events specifically designed for men.&lt;ref name=ancientcheating&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.howstuffworks.com/ancient-greece/first-olympics3.htm|author=Gibson, Candace|title=How the First Olympics Worked|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athletes were also known to drink "magic" potions and eat exotic meats in the hopes of giving them an athletic edge on their competition.&lt;ref name=ancientdoping&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/pf/63532314.html| title=Ancient Olympics mixed Naked Sports, Pagan Partying| publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=2009-01-05|first=Stefan|last=Lovgren}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If they were caught cheating, their likenesses were often engraved into stone and placed in a pathway that led to the Olympic stadium.&lt;ref name=ancientcheating/&gt;  In the modern Olympic era, chemically enhancing one's performance has evolved into a sophisticated science, but in the early years of the Modern Olympic movement the use of performance-enhancing drugs was almost as crude as its ancient predecessors. For example, the winner of the [[marathon (sports)|marathon]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Games]], [[Thomas Hicks (athlete)|Thomas Hicks]], was given [[strychnine]] and [[brandy]] by his coach, even during the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Hicks|publisher=Sports-reference.com|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/hi/tom-hicks-1.html|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes discovered ways to improve their athletic abilities by boosting testosterone. As their methods became more extreme, it became increasingly evident that the use of [[doping in sport|performance-enhancing drugs]] was not only a threat to the integrity of sport but could also have potentially fatal side effects on the athlete. The only Olympic death linked to athletic drug use occurred at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|Rome Games of 1960]]. During the cycling road race, [[Denmark at the 1960 Summer Olympics|Danish]] cyclist [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry found that he was under the influence of [[amphetamine]], which had caused him to lose consciousness during the race.&lt;ref name=drugdeath&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Anti-Doping|publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency|url=http://www.wada-ama.org/en/dynamic.ch2?pageCategory.id=312|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jensen's death exposed to the world how endemic drug use was among elite athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rome 1960|last=Maraniss|first=David|year=2008|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn= 1-4165-3407-5|authorlink=David Maraniss}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid–1960s, sports federations were starting to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs, and the IOC followed suit in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sharon|last=Begley|title=The Drug Charade|publisher=Newsweek|date=7 January 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/86079/output/print|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance-enhancing drugs was [[Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall]], a Swedish [[modern pentathlon|pentathlete]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use, 'two beers to steady his nerves'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall|publisher=123explore.com |url=http://www.123exp-biographies.com/t/00034345906/|accessdate=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liljenwall was the only athlete to test positive for a banned substance at the 1968 Olympics, as the technology and testing techniques improved, the number of athletes discovered to be chemically enhancing their performance increased as well. 
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L1209-0021, Kornelia Ender.jpg|thumb|left|Kornelia Ender]]
The most systematic case of drug use for athletic achievement is that of the East German Olympic teams of the 1970s and 1980s.  In 1990, documents were discovered that showed many [[East Germany|East German]] female athletes, especially swimmers, had been administered [[anabolic steroid]]s and other drugs by their coaches and trainers. Girls as young as eleven were started on the drug regimen without consent from their parents. American female swimmers, including [[Shirley Babashoff]], accused the [[East Germany at the 1976 Summer Olympics|East Germans]] of using performance-enhancing drugs as early as the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christine|last=Brennan |title=Babashoff had Mettle to Speak out about Steroids|date=14 July 2004|publisher=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/brennan/2004-07-15-brennan_x.htm|accessdate=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Babashoff's comments were dismissed by the international and domestic media as sour grapes since Babashoff, a clear favorite to win multiple gold medals, won three silver medals - losing all three times to either of the two East Germans [[Kornelia Ender]] or [[Petra Thümer]], and one gold medal in a relay.  There was no suspicion of cheating on the part of the East German female swimmers even though their medal tally increased from four silvers and one bronze in [[Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] to ten golds (out of a possible 12), six silvers, and one bronze in [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]].  No clear evidence was discovered until after the fall of the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|Berlin Wall]], when the aforementioned documents proved that East Germany had embarked on a state-sponsored drug regimen to dramatically improve their competitiveness at the Olympic Games and other international sporting events. Many of the East German authorities responsible for this program have been subsequently tried and found guilty of various crimes in the German penal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jere|last=Longman|title=Just Following Orders, Doctors' Orders|publisher=The New York Times|date=22 April 2001|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/22/sports/just-following-orders-doctors-orders.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DeutscheWelle&gt;{{cite web |title=Sports Doping Statistics Reach Plateau in Germany|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=26 February 2006|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,786574,00.html|accessdate=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to British journalist [[Andrew Jennings]], a [[KGB]] colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the [[International Olympic Committee]] to undermine [[doping test]]s and that Soviet athletes were "rescued with [these] tremendous efforts".&lt;ref name=DG2011&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0292739575 |title= Drug Games: The International Olympic Committee and the Politics of Doping |first= Thomas M. |last= Hunt |year= 2011 |publisher= University of Texas Press |isbn= 0292739575 |page= 66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the topic of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], a 1989 Australian study said "There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds.

Documents obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements.&lt;ref name=NYT160813&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html |title=The Soviet Doping Plan: Document Reveals Illicit Approach to ’84 Olympics |last=Ruiz |first=Rebecca R. |date= 13 August 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=2016-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name=NYT160813/&gt;

A very publicized steroid-related disqualification at an Olympic Games was the case of [[Canada|Canadian]] sprinter [[Ben Johnson (athlete)|Ben Johnson]], who won the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics|Men's 100 metres]] at the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Seoul Olympics]], but tested positive for [[stanozolol]]. His gold medal was subsequently stripped and awarded to runner-up [[Carl Lewis]], who himself had tested positive for banned substances prior to the Olympics, but had not been banned due to a lack of consistency in the application of the rules.  At that time National Olympic Committees had leeway to determine whether a specific athlete met the criteria to be banned from Olympic competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacquelin|last=Magnay|title=Carl Lewis's positive test covered up|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/17/1050172709693.html|date=18 April 2003|accessdate=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
In the late 1990s, the IOC took the initiative in a more organized battle against doping, leading to the formation of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) in 1999. The [[2000 Summer Olympics]] and [[2002 Winter Olympics]] have shown that the effort to eliminate performance-enhancing drugs from the Olympics is not over, as several medalists in weightlifting and cross-country skiing were disqualified due to failing a drug test. During the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], only one athlete failed a drug test and had a medal revoked. The IOC-established drug testing regimen (now known as the "Olympic Standard") has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations attempt to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Zachary|last=Coile|title=Bill Seeks to Toughen Drug Testing in Pro Sports|date=27 April 2005|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/04/27/MNGMICG0SS1.DTL|accessdate=2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing games]], 3,667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Both urine and blood testing was used in a coordinated effort to detect banned substances and recent [[blood doping|blood transfusions]].

What follows is a list of all the athletes that have tested positive for a banned substance either during or after an Olympic Games in which they competed.  Any medals listed were revoked by the [[International Olympic Commission]] (IOC). In 1967 the IOC banned the use of performance-enhancing drugs, instituted a Medical Commission, and created a list of banned substances.&lt;ref name="Mottram2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=David R.|last=Mottram|title=Drugs in Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2e4IUmuvrEC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=19 July 2012|date=30 March 2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-55086-4|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandatory testing began at the following year's Games.&lt;ref name="Mottram2011"/&gt; In a few cases the IOC has reversed earlier rulings that stripped athletes of medals.

===1980 Moscow===
{{main|1980 Summer Olympics|Doping in Russia#Background: Soviet era}}
Though no athletes were caught doping at the 1980 Summer Olympics, it has been claimed that athletes had begun using [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] and other drugs for which tests had not been yet developed. A 1989 report by a committee of the [[Australian Senate]] claimed that "there is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner...who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might well have been called the Chemists' Games".&lt;ref name="Hunt2007"/&gt;

A member of the IOC Medical Commission, Manfred Donike, privately ran additional tests with a new technique for identifying abnormal levels of testosterone by measuring its ratio to [[epitestosterone]] in [[urine]]. Twenty percent of the specimens he tested, including those from sixteen gold medalists would have resulted in disciplinary proceedings had the tests been official.&lt;ref name="Hunt2007"/&gt; The results of Donike's unofficial tests later convinced the IOC to add his new technique to their testing protocols.&lt;ref name="D.

Five athletes tested positive for the stimulant [[bromantan]] and were disqualified by the IOC, but later reinstated after an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport: swimmers [[Andrey Korneyev]] and [[Nina Zhivanevskaya]], Greco-Roman wrestler [[Zafar Guliyev]] and sprinter [[Marina Trandenkova]], all from Russia, and the Lithuanian track cyclist [[Rita Razmaitė]]. Dr. Vitaly Slionssarenko, physician to the Lithuanian cycling team and team coach [[Boris Vasilyev (cyclist)|Boris Vasilyev]] were expelled from the games.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wilson, Associated Press: [http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1996/IOC-Official-Says-Bromantan-Produced-by-Russian-Army/id-1c712015f2bce46a42c556882b94d089 IOC Official Says Bromantan Produced by Russian Army], AP News Archive, 31 July 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ind&gt;Pat Butcher: [https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/bromantan-is-russians-rocket-fuel-1307987.html Bromantan is Russians' 'rocket fuel'], The Independent, 3 August 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/31/sports/atlanta-day-12-notebook-three-ejected-for-drug-use.html ATLANTA: DAY 12 -- NOTEBOOK;Three Ejected for Drug Use], The New York Times, 31 July 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The CAS overturned the IOC decision, because bromantan had only recently been added to the prohibited list,&lt;ref name=SL&gt;[http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv4n3/JOHv4n3o.pdf Olympic News], Sports Library&lt;/ref&gt; and the athletes and officials were reprimanded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-05/news/ss-31603_1_british-olympic-association Arbitrators Reinstate Russians and British Swimmer May Sue], LA Times, 5 August 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9314900 | year = 1997 | last1 = Burnat | first1 = P | last2 = Payen | first2 = A | last3 = Le Brumant-Payen | first3 = C | last4 = Hugon | first4 = M | last5 = Ceppa | first5 = F | title = Bromontan, a new doping agent | volume = 350 | issue = 9082 | pages = 963–4 | journal = Lancet | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(05)63310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1370&amp;dat=19960806&amp;id=apxOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TwsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1592,857231&amp;hl=no Special Court overturns IOC decisions vs. Russians], Manila Standard, 6 August 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians had argued that bromantans wasn't a stimulant and thus not banned.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Tabbi: [http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russians-fume-as-3rd-olympian-disqualified/320740.html Russians Fume as 3rd Olympian Disqualified], The Moscow Times, 31 July 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/02/sports/russians-want-a-drug-lifted-from-banned-list.html Russians Want a Drug Lifted From Banned List], The New York Times, 1 August 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Montgomery]], who was part of the USA Men's 4 × 100 m relay team which won the gold, in 2008 admitted that he had used [[Testosterone]] and [[Human Growth Hormone|HGH]] before the Sydney Games, and said “I have a gold medal that I’m sitting on that I didn’t get with my own ability”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Zinser: [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/sports/othersports/26montgomery.html Montgomery Admits Using Drugs Before Games], The New York Times, 25 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; IOC at the time said they would look into the case,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Track-and-Field/Features/2008/November/24/IOC-ready-to-investigate-Montgomery-s-doping IOC ready to investigate Montgomery's doping], teamusa.org, 24 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; but no action has since been taken by IOC to disqualify Montgomery from the Games.

"Zero Tolerance for Doping" was adopted as an official slogan for the Beijing Olympic Games.&lt;ref name="dwde"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3530852,00.html|work=Deutsche Welle|title=Beijing Faces Big Challenge in Keeping Olympics Drug-Free|date=8 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of athletes were already eliminated by testing prior to coming to Beijing.&lt;ref name="dwde" /&gt;

Out of the 4,500 samples that were collected from participating athletes at the games, six athletes with positive specimens were ousted from the competition. Further positive tests were found in 2016, as samples had been sealed and stored for eight years. The quality of the original testing was questioned when the BBC reported that samples positive for [[Erythropoietin|EPO]] were labeled as negative by Chinese laboratories in July, 2008.&lt;ref name="McGrath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7516484.stm|first=Matt|last=McGrath|work=[[BBC]]|title=Concerns over Olympic drug test |date=21 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial rate of positive findings was lower than at Athens in 2004, but the prevalence of doping had not necessarily decreased; the technology for creating and concealing drugs had become more sophisticated, and a number of drugs could not be detected.&lt;ref name="dwde" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McGrath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel082308"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/0,1518,573934,00.html |author=KNA|author2=Reuters|title=Ukrainischer Gewichtheber Razoronov positiv getestet |journal=Der Spiegel|date=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, the Turkish Athletics Federation confirmed that an in-competition test of [[Elvan Abeylegesse]] at the 2007 IAAF World Championships
in Athletics had been retested and found to be positive for a controlled substance, and that she had been temporarily suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=13 August 2015 |url=http://www.taf.org.tr/elvan-abeylegesse-ilgili-kamuoyuna-duyuru/ |title=Elvan Abeylegesse tests positive |publisher=Turkish Athletics |accessdate=13 August 2015 |archivedate=16 August 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816011015/http://www.taf.org.tr/elvan-abeylegesse-ilgili-kamuoyuna-duyuru/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 March 2017, the [[IAAF]] confirmed the positive test, announced retroactive disqualifications and voided all of her results from 25 August 2007 until 25 August 2009, including the 2008 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name="IAAF March 2017 Newsletter"&gt;[https://www.iaaf.org/download/download?filename=a1f770c2-53e7-465c-900c-755d841adee1.pdf&amp;urlslug=NEWS%20181%20-%20March%202017 IAAF March 2017 Newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, she was stripped of two silver medals she had won in the women's 5,000 and 10,000 meter races.

In May 2016, following the [[Doping in Russia|Russian doping scandal]], the IOC announced that 32 targeted retests had come back positive for performance-enhancing drugs, of which [[Russian News Agency TASS]] announced that 14 were from Russian athletes, 11 of them track and field athletes, including 2012 Olympic champion high jumper [[Anna Chicherova]]. Authorities have sent the B-samples for confirmation testing. Those confirmed as having taken doping agents stand to lose records and medals from the 2008 games to 2016 under IOC and WADA rules.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/36391896 Competitors return positive drugs tests]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 2016, the [[International Weightlifting Federation|IWF]] reported that as a consequence of the IOC's reanalyses of samples from the 2008 Olympic Games, the samples of the following seven weightlifters had returned positive results: [[Hripsime Khurshudyan]] (Armenia), [[Intigam Zairov]] (Azerbaijan), [[Alexandru Dudoglo]] (Moldova), gold medalist [[Ilya Ilyin]] (Kazakhstan), bronze medalist [[Nadezda Evstyukhina]] and silver medalist [[Marina Shainova]] (both from Russia), and [[Nurcan Taylan]] (Turkey).

===2012 London===
{{main|2012 Summer Olympics}}
It was announced prior to the Summer games that half of all competitors would be tested for drugs, with 150 scientists set to take 6,000 samples between the start of the games and the end of the Paralympic games.&lt;ref name="BBCJul15"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18849517|title=London 2012: All medallists to be drugs tested at Olympics|publisher=BBC News Online|accessdate=2012-07-28|date=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; All medalists would also be tested. The Olympic anti-doping laboratory would test up to 400 samples every day for more than 240 prohibited substances.&lt;ref name="BBCJul15"/&gt;

The head of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA), John Fahey, announced on 24 July that 107 athletes had been sanctioned for doping offences in the six months to 19 June.&lt;ref name="ReutJul24"&gt;{{cite news|first=Karolos|last=Grohmann|url=https://www.reuters.com/london-olympics-2012/articles/2012/07/24/testers-nab-more-100-athletes-prior-london-wada|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201104443/http://www.reuters.com/london-olympics-2012/articles/2012/07/24/testers-nab-more-100-athletes-prior-london-wada|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 February 2013|title=Testers nab more than 100 athletes - WADA|agency=Reuters|accessdate=2012-08-04|date=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "In-competition" period began on 16 July.

Russian [[Darya Pishchalnikova]] participated in the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's discus throw|2012 Olympics]] and was awarded a silver medal. However, she tested positive for the anabolic steroid [[oxandrolone]] in the samples taken in May 2012. In December 2012, she sent an email to WADA containing details on an alleged [[Doping in Russia|state-run doping program in Russia]]. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the email reached three top WADA officials but the agency decided not to open an inquiry and instead sent her email to Russian sports officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/16/sports/olympics/world-anti-doping-agency-russia-cheating.html|title=Even With Confession of Cheating, World’s Doping Watchdog Did Nothing|last=Macur|first=Rebecca R.

A WADA report released in 2015 detailed an extensive [[Doping in Russia|Russian state-sponsored doping]] program implicating athletes, coaches, various Russian institutions, doctors and labs. The report stated that the London Olympic Games "were, in a sense, sabotaged by the admission of athletes who should have not been competing" and detailed incidents of bribery and bogus urine samples. The report recommended that Russia be barred from track and field events for the 2016 Olympics. It also recommended lifetime bans for five coaches and five athletes from the country, including runners [[Mariya Savinova]], [[Ekaterina Poistogova]], [[Anastasiya Bazdyreva]], [[Kristina Ugarova]], and [[Tatjana Myazina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruiz|first1=Rebecca R.|title=Drugs Pervade Sport in Russia, World Anti-Doping Agency Report Finds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/sports/russian-athletes-part-of-state-sponsored-doping-program-report-finds.html|work=The New York Times|date=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Independent Commission Report #1|url=https://wada-main-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/resources/files/wada_independent_commission_report_1_en.pdf|publisher=Independent Commission Investigation|date=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 2016, it was announced that four London 2012 Olympic weightlifting champions had tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.

If confirmed, Kazakhstan would drop from 12th to 23rd in the 2012 medal standings. Six other lifters who competed at the 2012 Games also tested positive after hundreds of samples were reanalysed. Among them are Russia's [[Apti Aukhadov]] (silver at 85&amp;nbsp;kg), Ukraine's [[Yuliya Kalina]] (bronze at 58&amp;nbsp;kg), Belarusian [[Maryna Shkermankova]] (bronze at 69&amp;nbsp;kg), Azerbaijan's [[Boyanka Kostova]] and Belarus duo [[Dzina Sazanavets]] and [[Yauheni Zharnasek]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/sport/weightlifting/36545090 London 2012: Four Olympic weightlifting champions test positive]&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July 2016, IWF has reported in the second wave of re-sampling that three silver medalists from Russia, namely [[Natalia Zabolotnaya]] (at 75&amp;nbsp;kg), [[Aleksandr Ivanov (weightlifter)|Aleksandr Ivanov]] (at 94&amp;nbsp;kg) and [[Svetlana Tsarukayeva]] (at 63&amp;nbsp;kg), together with bronze medalists Armenian [[Hripsime Khurshudyan]] (at 75+ kg), Belarusian [[Iryna Kulesha]] (at 75&amp;nbsp;kg) and Moldovan [[Cristina Iovu]] (at 53&amp;nbsp;kg) have tested positive for steroid [[dehydrochlormethyltestosterone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Eleven London 2012 weightlifters fail doping tests|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-sport-doping-weightlifting-idUKKCN1072EG|agency=Reuters|date=27 July 2016|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aukhadov was stripped of his silver medal by the IOC on 18 October 2016.&lt;ref name="iocauk"&gt;https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-sanctions-two-athletes-for-failing-anti-doping-test-at-london-2012&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 October 2016 Maiya Maneza was stripped of her gold medal.&lt;ref name="IOC2016-10-27"/&gt; In November 2016, Ilyin was stripped of the London gold medal.&lt;ref name="AP20161124"/&gt;

The Taiwanese weightlifter [[Lin Tzu-chi]] was withdrawn from the games hours before her event by her country's delegation for an abnormal drugs test.&lt;ref name="GuardAug16"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/rio-olympics-weightlifting-world-record-nijat-rahimov-doping-controversy-kazakhstan|title=Kazakhstan's weightlifting triumph clouded by doping controversy|date=11 August 2016|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 Turin===
{{main|2006 Winter Olympics}}
On 25 April 2007, six Austrian athletes were banned for life from the Olympics for their involvement in a doping scandal at the 2006 Turin Olympics, the first time the [[IOC]] punished athletes without a positive or missed doping test. The Austrians were found guilty of possessing doping substances and taking part in a conspiracy, based on materials seized by Italian police during a raid on the athletes' living quarters. The Austrians also had their competition results from Turin annulled.&lt;ref name=AustTurin/&gt; A seventh athlete, cross-country skier [[Christian Hoffmann]], had his case referred to the International Ski Federation for further investigation, but IOC charges were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/winter_sports/6592167.stm |title=Austria fined for Olympic doping|date=24 May 2007|accessdate=2016-10-24|quote=The six athletes have also had their results in Turin annulled while charges against a seventh athlete, cross country skier Christian Hofmann, were dismissed.|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CH2006&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/crosscountry/story/_/id/7322093/ex-olympic-cross-country-ski-champ-christian-hoffman-gets-six-year-ban |author=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN|title= Christian Hoffmann gets 6-year ban| date= 6 December 2011|quote=In December 2011 the ski federation gave Hoffmann a six-year ban for having his blood taken for doping purposes at a Vienna lab between 2003 and 2006 and possessing a centrifuge for blood enrichment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC has retested nearly 500 doping samples that were collected at the 2006 Turin Games. In 2014, the Estonian Olympic Committee was notified by the IOC that a retested sample from cross-country skier [[Kristina Šmigun]] had tested positive. On 24 October 2016, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] Athletes' Commission stated that Šmigun, who won two gold medals at the Turin Games, faces a [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] hearing before the end of October. If Šmigun were to be stripped of her gold medals, Kateřina Neumannová of Czech Republic could be elevated to gold in the [[Cross-country skiing at the 2006 Winter Olympics – Women's 15 kilometre pursuit|7.5 + 7.5 km double pursuit]] event.

===2010 Vancouver===
{{main|2010 Winter Olympics}}
On 23 December 2016, the IOC stated that it will re-analyse all samples from Russian athletes at the Olympic Winter Games of Vancouver 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-starts-disciplinary-procedures-against-28-russian-athletes-from-sochi-2014|title=IOC STARTS DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES AGAINST 28 RUSSIAN ATHLETES FROM SOCHI 2014|date=23 December 2016|accessdate=2017-02-10|publisher=INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE|location= Lausanne, Switzerland|quote=The IOC will also re-analyse all samples from Russian athletes at the Olympic Winter Games Vancouver 2010.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2017, the IOC stated that one sole athlete was caught from retests of doping samples from the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games. Biathlete Teja Gregorin was confirmed as this athlete by the [[International Biathlon Union]].  A total of 1195 samples from Vancouver 2010 (70% of the 1700 available) were reanalyzed. This included all medalists and all of the 170 Russian athletes.  The IOC requested all Russian samples from the 2010 Games be retested after the publication of the McLaren Report. Russia's disappointing performance at Vancouver (11th in gold medal table with a total of 3 golds) is cited as the reason behind the implementation of a doping scheme alleged to have been in operation at major events such as the 2014 Games at Sochi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1057117/biathlete-gregorin-confirmed-as-athlete-who-failed-vancouver-2010-doping-retest|title=Biathlete Gregorin confirmed as athlete who failed Vancouver 2010 doping retest|first=Michael |last=Pavitt|date=26 October 2017|publisher=Inside the Games|accessdate=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 Sochi===
{{main|2014 Winter Olympics|Doping in Russia}}
According to the director of the country’s antidoping laboratory at the time, [[Grigory Rodchenkov]], dozens of Russian athletes at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, including at least 15 medal winners, were part of a state-run [[Doping in Russia|doping program]], meticulously planned for years to ensure dominance at the Games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/sports/russia-doping-sochi-olympics-2014.html?_r=2 Russian Insider Says State-Run Doping Fueled Olympic Gold], nytimes, 12 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, following the release of the McLaren report on Russian doping at the Sochi Olympics, the [[International Olympic Committee]] announced the initiation of an investigation of 28 Russian athletes (the number later rose to 46) at the Sochi Olympic Games. ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' reported the names of 17 athletes, of whom 15 are among the 28 under investigation.&lt;ref name="Gazzetta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Sport-Invernali/30-12-2016/ghiaccio-pattinaggio-scandalo-sochi-2014-sospetti-sotnikova-kostner-d-argento-180226631450.shtml |title=Ghiaccio, pattinaggio.

Three female [[figure skaters]] were named as being under investigation. They are [[Adelina Sotnikova]], the singles gold medalist, as well as pairs skaters [[Tatiana Volosozhar]] and [[Ksenia Stolbova]]. Volosozhar and Stolbova won gold and silver medals, respectively, in pairs skating. Both also won gold medals in the team event, which also puts the other eight team medalists at risk of losing their golds.&lt;ref&gt;https://uawire.org/news/mcclaren-doping-report-may-affect-russian-figure-skaters&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2017 the proceeding against Sotnikova was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1057686/exclusive-olympic-figure-skating-champion-cleared-of-doping-charge-by-ioc-but-four-russian-skiers-disqualified | title=Exclusive: Olympic figure skating champion cleared of doping charge by IOC but four Russian skiers disqualified | first=Nick|last=Butler|date=9 Nov 2017|accessdate=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six cross-country skiers were suspended from competition on the basis of the [[McLaren Report]]: [[Evgeniy Belov]], [[Alexander Legkov]], [[Alexey Petukhov]], [[Maxim Vylegzhanin]], [[Julia Ivanova (cross-country skier)|Yulia Ivanova]] and [[Evgenia Shapovalova]].

[[Nikita Kryukov]], [[Alexander Bessmertnykh (skier)|Alexander Bessmertnykh]] and [[Natalya Matveyeva]] were also disqualified on December 22, 2017.&lt;ref name="International Olympic Committee"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-sanctions-11-russian-athletes-as-part-of-oswald-commission-findings|title=IOC sanctions 11 Russian athletes as part of Oswald Commission findings|date=2017-12-22|work=International Olympic Committee|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Biathlon Union]] suspended two Russian biathletes who were in the Sochi games: [[Olga Vilukhina]] and [[Yana Romanova]]. Vilukhina won silver in sprint, and both women were on a relay team that won the silver medal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1046102/ibu-dismisses-cases-against-22-russians-named-in-mclaren-report&lt;/ref&gt; They were disqualified and stripped of their medals on 27 November 2017.&lt;ref name="ReferenceL"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-sanctions-five-russian-athletes-and-publishes-first-full-decision-as-part-of-the-oswald-commission-findings|title=IOC sanctions five Russian athletes and publishes first full decision as part of the Oswald Commission findings|date=2017-11-27|work=International Olympic Committee|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation]] suspended four Russian skeleton sliders. They were  [[Aleksandr Tretyakov (skeleton racer)|Alexander Tretyakov]], [[Elena Nikitina]], [[Maria Orlova]] and [[Olga Potylitsina]]. Tretyakov won a gold medal, and Nikitina won a bronze.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rferl.org/a/four-russian-skeleton-athletes-suspended-doping-2014-sochi-olympics/28206851.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1045372/russias-nikitina-denies-knowledge-of-any-suspension-from-skeleton-competition&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 22, 2017, the IOC stripped these medals and imposed lifetime Olympic bans on all four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-sanctions-four-russian-athletes-as-part-of-oswald-commission-findings|title=IOC sanctions four Russian athletes as part of Oswald Commission findings|date= 22 Nov 2017|accessdate=2017-11-22|publisher=International Olympic Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeleton racer [[Sergei Chudinov]] was sanctioned on 28 November 2017.&lt;ref name="ReferenceL"/&gt;

Seven Russian female ice hockey players were to have hearings before the [[Oswald Commission]] on November 22, 2017. Two of the seven were accused of submitting samples showing readings that were physically impossible to be held by a woman. The Russian women's ice hockey team finished sixth at Sochi 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1058172/fis-to-provide-update-on-russian-skiers-as-ice-hockey-players-set-to-appear-before-oswald-commission |title=FIS to provide update on Russian skiers as ice hockey players set to appear before Oswald Commission|first=Liam|last=Morgan|date=21 Nov 2017|accessdate=2017-11-22|publisher=Dunsar Media Company Ltd.|work=Insidethegames.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 12, 2017, six of them were disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-sanctions-six-russian-athletes-and-closes-one-case-as-part-of-oswald-commission-findings|title=IOC sanctions six Russian athletes and closes one case as part of the Oswald Commission findingsdate=December 12, 2017|accessdate=December 13, 2017|work=olympic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tatiana Burina]] and [[Anna Shukina]] were also disqualified ten days later.&lt;ref name="International Olympic Committee"/&gt;

'''Encog''' is a [[machine learning]] framework available for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.Net]].&lt;ref name="EncogJMLR"&gt;J. Heaton http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume16/heaton15a/heaton15a.pdf Encog: Library of Interchangeable Machine Learning Models for Java and C#&lt;/ref&gt;
Encog supports different learning algorithms such as  [[Bayesian Networks]], [[Hidden Markov Models]] and [[Support Vector Machines]].
However, its main strength lies in its [[neural network]] algorithms. Encog contains classes to create a wide variety of networks, as well as support classes to normalize and process data for these neural networks. Encog trains using many different techniques.  Multithreading is used to allow optimal training performance on multicore machines.

Encog can be used for many tasks, including medical&lt;ref name="EncogMedical"&gt;D. Heider, J. Verheyen, D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7457">'''Genome-based peptide fingerprint scanning''' (GFS) is a system in [[bioinformatics]] analysis that attempts to identify the genomic origin (that is, what species they come from) of sample [[protein]]s by scanning their [[peptide-mass fingerprint]] against the  theoretical translation and [[proteolytic digest]] of an entire genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2003|url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/100/1/20|title = Abstract of Genome-based peptide fingerprint scanning|journal= PNAS|accessdate = 2006-10-06|doi= 10.1073/pnas.0136893100|pmid = 12518051|volume=100|issue = 1|pages=20–25|pmc= 140871|last1 = Giddings|first1 = M.

== History and background ==
GFS was designed by Michael C. Giddings (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) et al., and released in 2003. Giddings expanded the algorithms for GFS from earlier ideas. Two papers were published in 1993 explaining the techniques used to identify proteins in sequence databases. These methods determined the mass of peptides using [[mass spectrometry]], and then used the mass to search protein databases to identify the proteins &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henzel|first=W J|author2=T M Billeci |author3=J T Stults |author4=S C Wong |author5=C Grimley |author6=C Watanabe |title=Identifying proteins from two-dimensional gels by molecular mass searching of peptide fragments in protein sequence databases|journal=PNAS|date=1 June 1993|volume=90|issue=11|pages=5011–5015|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/90/11/5011 |doi=10.1073/pnas.90.11.5011 |pmid=8506346 |pmc=46643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mann|first=Matthais |author2=Peter Højrup |author3=Peter Roepstorff |title=Use of mass spectrometric molecular weight information to identify proteins in sequence databases|journal=Biol. Mass Spectrom|date=June 1993|volume=22|issue=6|pages=338–345|doi=10.1002/bms.1200220605|pmid=8329463}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 a more complex program was released called [[Mascot (software)|Mascot]] that integrated three types of protein/database searches: peptide molecular weights, [[tandem mass spectrometry]] from one or more peptide, and combination mass data with amino acid sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=David N.|author2=Darryl J. C. Pappin |author3=David M. Creasy |author4=John S. Cottrell |title=Probability-based protein identification by searching sequence databases using mass spectrometry data|journal=Electrophoresis|date=1 December 1999|volume=20|issue=18|pages=3551–3567|doi=10.1002/(sici)1522-2683(19991201)20:18&lt;3551::aid-elps3551&gt;3.0.co;2-2 |pmid=10612281}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fallback with this widely used program is that it is unable to detect alternative splice sites that are not currently annotated, and it not usually able to find proteins that have not been annotated. Giddings built upon these sources to create GFS which would compare peptide mass data to entire genomes to identify the proteins. Giddings system is able to find new annotations of genes that have not been found, such as undocumented genes and undocumented alternative splice sites.

==Research examples==
In 2012 research was published where genes and proteins were found in a model organism that could not have been found without GFS because they had not been previously annotated. The planarian [[Schmidtea mediterranea]] has been used in research for over 100 years. This planarian is capable of regenerating missing body parts and is therefore emerging as potential model organism for stem cell research. Planarians are covered in mucus which aids in locomotion, in protecting them from predation, and in helping their immune system. The genome of ''Schmidtea mediterranea'' is sequenced but mostly un-annotated making it a prime candidate for genome-based peptide fingerprint scanning. When the proteins were analyzed with GFS 1,604 proteins were identified. These proteins had mostly not been annotated before they were found with GFS They were also able to find the mucous subproteome (all the genes associated with mucus production). They found that this proteome was conserved in the sister species ''Schmidtea mansoni''. The mucous subproteome is so conserved that 119 [[ortholog]]s of planarians are found in humans. Due to the similarity in these genes the planarian can now be used as a model to study mucous protein function in humans. This is relevant for infections and diseases related to mucous aberrancies such as [[cystic fibrosis]], [[asthma]], and other lung diseases. These genes could not have been found without GFS because they had not been previously annotated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bocchinfuso|first=Donald G.|title=Proteomic Profiling of the Planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and Its Mucous Reveals Similarities with Human Secretions and Those Predicted for Parasitic Flatworms|pmid=22653920|journal=Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics|doi=10.1074/mcp.M112.019026|volume=11|issue=9|date=September 2012|pages=681–91|pmc=3434776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, proteogenomic mapping research was done with [[ENCODE]] to identify translational regions in the human genome. They applied peptide fingerprint scanning and MASCOT to the protein data to find regions that may not have been previously annotated as translated in the human genome. This search against the whole genome revealed that approximately 4% of unique peptide that they found were outside of previously annotated regions. Also the comparison of the whole genome revealed 15% more hits than from a protein database search (such as MASCOT) alone. GFS can be used as a complementary method for annotation due to the fact that you can find new genes or splice sites that have not been annotated before. However it is important to remember that the whole genome approach used by GFS can be less sensitive than programs that look only at annotated regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khatun|first=Jainab|title=Whole human genome proteogenomic mapping for ENCODE cell line data: identifying protein-coding regions|journal=BMC Genomics|date=February 2013|volume=14|page=141|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/14/141|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-14-141|pmid=23448259|pmc=3607840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Half metar sattar.JPG|thumb|The electronic structure of a half-metal. &lt;math&gt;E_f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fermi level]], &lt;math&gt;N(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density of states]] for spin down (on the left) and spin up (on the right). In this case, the half-metal is conducting in the minority spin channel.]]

A '''half-metal''' is any substance that acts as a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] to [[electron]]s of one [[spin (physics)|spin]] orientation, but as an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] or [[semiconductor]] to those of the opposite orientation. Although all half-metals are [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] (or [[Ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]]), most ferromagnets are not half-metals. Many of the known examples of half-metals are [[oxide]]s, [[sulfide]]s, or [[Heusler alloy]]s.&lt;ref name=COEY02&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J.M.D. |last1=Coey |first2=M.|last2=Venkatesan|year=2002 |title=Half-metallic ferromagnetism: Example of CrO2 |journal=Journal of Applied Physics |volume=91 |issue=10 |pages=8345–50 |doi=10.1063/1.1447879 |bibcode = 2002JAP....91.8345C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In half-metals, the valence band for one spin orientation is partially filled while there is a gap in the density of states for the other spin orientation. This results in conducting behavior for only electrons in the first spin orientation. In some half-metals, the majority spin channel is the conducting one while in others the minority channel is.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Half-metals were first described in 1983, as an explanation for the electrical properties of Mn-based [[Heusler alloy]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Class of Materials: Half-Metallic Ferromagnets|publisher=Phys. Rev. Lett.|author=R. A. de Groot, F. M. Mueller, P. G. van Engen, and K. H. J. Buschow|year=1983|volume=50|issue=25|page=2024|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.50.2024|bibcode=1983PhRvL..50.2024D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable half-metals are [[chromium(IV) oxide]], [[magnetite]], and [[lanthanum strontium manganite]] (LSMO),&lt;ref name=COEY02/&gt; as well as [[chromium arsenide]]. Half-metals have attracted some interest for their potential use in [[spintronics]].{{fact|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9151">'''Helium-3 surface spin echo''' ('''HeSE''') is an inelastic scattering technique in [[surface science]] that has been used to measure microscopic dynamics at well-defined surfaces in [[ultra-high vacuum]]. The information available from HeSE complements and extends that available from other inelastic scattering techniques such as [[neutron spin echo]] and traditional [[Helium atom scattering|helium-4 atom scattering]] (HAS).

== Principles ==

The experimental principles of the HeSE experiment are analogous to those of neutron spin echo, differing in details such as the nature of the probe/sample interactions that give rise to scattering. In outline, a polarized &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He beam is created by a supersonic expansion followed by a spin-filtering stage (polariser). The helium scatters from the experimental sample and is detected at the end of the beamline after another spin-filtering stage (analyser). Before and after the scattering process, the beam passes through magnetic fields that precess the probe spins in the usual sense of a [[spin echo]] experiment. The raw data of the experiment are the spin-resolved scattered helium intensities as a function of the incoming magnetic field integral, outgoing field integral and any other variable parameters relevant to specific experiments, such as surface orientation and temperature. In the most general kind of scattering-with-precession experiment, the data can be used to construct the 2D 'wavelength intensity matrix' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kole|first1=P.R.|last2=Jardine|first2=A.P.|last3=Hedgeland|first3=H.|last4=Alexandrowicz|first4=G.|title=Measuring surface phonons with a 3He spin echo spectrometer: a two-dimensional approach|journal=J. Phys.: Condens. Matter|date=2010|volume=22|issue=304018|doi=10.1088/0953-8984/22/30/304018|accessdate=19 September 2015|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/22/30/304018/meta}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the surface scattering process, i.e. the probability that a helium atom of a certain incoming wavelength scatters into a state with a certain outgoing wavelength.

Conventional 'spin echo' measurements are a common special case of the more general scattering-with-precession measurements, in which the incoming and outgoing magnetic field integrals are constrained to be equal. The polarization of the outgoing beam is measured as a function of the precession field integral by measuring the intensity of the outgoing beam resolved into different spin states. The spin echo case is referred to as a type of 'tilted projection measurement'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alexandrowicz|first1=G.|last2=Jardine|first2=A.P.|title=Helium spin echo spectroscopy: studying surface dynamics with ultra-high-energy resolution|journal=J. Phys.: Condens. Matter|date=2007|volume=19|issue=305001|doi=10.1088/0953-8984/19/30/305001|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/19/30/305001/meta|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spin echo measurements are an appropriate tilted projection for quasi-elastic measurements of surface dynamics because the raw data are closely related to the [[intermediate scattering function]] (ISF), which in many cases can be interpreted in terms of standard dynamical signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jardine|first1=A.P.|last2=Hedgeland|first2=H.|last3=Alexandrowicz|first3=G.|last4=Allison|first4=W.|last5=Ellis|first5=J.|title=Helium-3 spin-echo: Principles and application to dynamics at surfaces|journal=Prog.

== Applications ==

The surface processes that HeSE can measure can be broadly divided into elastic, quasielastic and inelastic processes. Measurements in which the predominant signal is elastically scattered include standard helium [[diffraction]] and the measurement of [[Selective adsorption|selective adsorption resonances]]. Quasielastic measurements generally correspond to measurements of microscopic [[surface diffusion]] in which the Doppler-like energy gain and loss of the helium atoms is small compared to the beam energy. More strongly inelastic measurements can provide information about energy loss channels on the surface such as [[surface phonon]]s.

=== Microscopic diffusion ===

HeSE has been used to study the diffusion rates and mechanisms of atoms and molecules ('adsorbates') at surfaces. A non-exhaustive list of the research themes associated with HeSE diffusion measurements include:

=== Selective adsorption resonances ===

'''Homogenization''' or '''homogenisation''' is any of several processes used to make a [[mixture]] of two mutually non-soluble liquids the same throughout. This is achieved by turning one of the liquids into a state consisting of extremely small particles distributed uniformly throughout the other liquid. A typical example is the homogenization of milk, where the milk fat globules are reduced in size and dispersed uniformly through the rest of the milk.&lt;ref name=Britannica_online&gt;{{Citation

==Definition==
Homogenization (from "[[homogeneous]];" [[Greek language|Greek]], ''homogenes'': ''homos,'' same + ''genos,'' kind)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/homo- homo-, word origin]&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of converting two [[immiscible]] liquids (i.e. liquids that are not soluble, in all proportions, one in another) into an [[emulsion]]&lt;ref name=Food_Lipids&gt;{{cite book | last =McClements | first = David J. | chapter  = Lipid-Based Emulsions and Emulsifiers |editor1-last=Akoh |editor1-first=Casimir C. |editor2-last=Min |editor2-first=David B. | title=Food Lipids: Chemistry, Nutrition, and Biotechnology |trans-title=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPglndmgXU8C&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Casimir+and+Akoh+V.+Emulsion+Formation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iOxRUoSDG-7i4AON4YDoDg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Casimir%20and%20Akoh%20V.%20Emulsion%20Formation&amp;f=false |edition=Third |series=Food Science and Technology  |year=2008 |month= |origyear= |publisher=[[CRC Press|CRC]] |location=Boca Raton, Florida |isbn=978-1420046649 |id= |page= 77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (an emulsion is a type of [[colloid]], which is a substance microscopically dispersed throughout another substance; when both the dispersed and the continuous substances are liquids, the colloid is called an emulsion). Sometimes two types of homogenization are distinguished: primary homogenization, when the emulsion is created directly from separate liquids; and secondary homogenization, when the emulsion is created by the reduction in size of droplets in an existing emulsion.&lt;ref name=Food_Lipids/&gt;
Homogenization is achieved by a mechanical device called a ''homogenizer''.&lt;ref name=Food_Lipids/&gt;

==Application==
One of the oldest applications of homogenization is in [[milk]] processing.  It is normally preceded by "standardization" (the mixing of several different milking [[herd]]s and/or [[dairies]] to produce a more consistent [[raw milk]] prior to processing and to prevent, reduce and delay natural separation of [[cream]] from the rest of the [[emulsion]]). The [[Butterfat|fat in milk]] normally separates from the [[water]] and collects at the top. Homogenization breaks the fat into smaller sizes so it no longer separates, allowing the sale of non-separating milk at any fat specification.

==Methods==
[[File:Homogenizing valve.svg|thumb|400px|Homogenizing valve, a method to homogenize at high pressure.]]

Milk homogenization is accomplished by mixing massive amounts of harvested milk to create a constant, then forcing the milk at high pressure through small holes. Yet another method of homogenization uses [[extruder]]s, [[hammermill]]s, or [[colloid mill]]s to [[mill (grinding)|mill (grind)]] solids. Milk homogenization is an essential tool of the milk food industry to prevent creating various levels of flavor and fat concentration.

Another application of homogenization is in soft drinks like cola products. The reactant mixture is rendered to intense homogenization, to as much as 35,000 psi, so that various constituents do not separate out during storage or distribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1931">The '''Hubble European Space Agency Information Centre''' ('''HEIC''') is a science communication office, established at the [[Space Telescope - European Coordinating Facility]] (ST-ECF) in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] late in 1999. This initiative was taken so as to fulfil the NASA/ESA [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) outreach and education tasks for the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), as outlined in an agreement between [[NASA]] and [[ESA]].

Over the past few years HEIC has become a very distinguished communication office of experts using the newest software and techniques. The European Hubble office has produced large amounts of astronomical material suitable both for educational purposes and wider public consumption. HEIC provides a well-assorted archive that is publicly available on its web page.

The work is centred on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble science results and images. These are often European in origin, and so not only increase the awareness of ESA’s Hubble share (15%), but the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. Furthermore, the group produces video releases, innovative educational material, CD-ROMs, brochures, posters, as well as DVDs and museum information kiosks, and much more.

The Hubble Information Centre is headed by the science communication specialist [[Lars Lindberg Christensen]] and the lead graphic designer is [[Martin Kornmesser]].

==Innovation Accelerator==
The Imagine Cup Innovation Accelerator was a program that, between 2006 and 2008, provided Imagine Cup Software Design teams with direction on the next stage of developing their innovative ideas into a business. Each year, between 2006–2008, six teams were selected for the Innovation Accelerator program. Participants in the Innovation Accelerator program travelled to the Microsoft [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] campus in [[Silicon Valley]] and received technical support and business coaching to create the must-have technology and communications applications of the future.
In 2010, Microsoft began inviting every Imagine Cup team to participate in its new program for startups: Microsoft BizSpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chuck Lawton |url=http://archive.wired.com/geekdad/2010/07/looking-back-at-the-imagine-cup-2010/ |title=Wired.com|date=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this program, startups receive access to current, full-featured software development tools and platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BizSpark |url=http://www.bizspark.com/Pages/home.aspx |title=BizSpark |date=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous teams include:

* 2006: [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Croatia]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[India]]
* 2007: [[Ireland]], [[Jamaica]], [[Korea]], [[Mexico]], [[Poland]], [[Thailand]],
* 2008: [[Australia]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]], [[South Africa]],

==Imagine Cup Grant==
A three-year, $3 million competitive grant program was established by Microsoft in 2011 to support a select number of winning teams’ solutions to go to market and realize its potential to solve a critical global problem. The inaugural grant recipients were announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on January 27, 2012 which included the following teams:

* Team Lifelens from the United States
* Team Apptenders from Croatia
* Team Falcon Dev from Ecuador
* Team OaSys from Jordan

The grant packages include US$75,000 for each team, as well as software, cloud computing services, solution provider support, premium Microsoft BizSpark account benefits and access to local resources such as the Microsoft Innovation Centers. Microsoft will also connect grant recipients with its network of investors, nongovernmental organization partners and business partners.

==Recognition==
Imagine Cup participants from around the world who won their regional competitions in 2010 have been recognized by their government leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Microsoft|url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2010/10/27/government-leaders-celebrate-imagine-cup-successes.aspx |title=Microsoft on the Issues Blog |date=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In October 2010, two Imagine Cup 2010 United States finalists (Wilson To &lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wilson-to/educate-to-innovate-white_b_768829.html&lt;/ref&gt;  from the [[Mobilife]]team and Christian Hood from [[BeastWare]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} were invited to participate in the [[White House Science Fair]].  
New Zealand’s Prime Minister, Hon. [[John Key]] sent Team [[#Software Design|OneBeep]] from New Zealand a personal letter that congratulated them on their third-place finish.
Team Skeek from Thailand, winners of the 2010 Software Design competition, met Dr. Khunying Kalaya Sophonpanich, a member of Parliament and Secretary General of The Rajapruek Institute Foundation.
Microsoft Poland and members of the European Parliament hosted the “Pushing the Boundaries of Innovation” conference in Brussels. Imagine Cup teams from Poland (fteams and Mutants), Serbia (TFZR), Germany (Mediator), and Belgium (Nom Nom Productions) were in attendance.  
Greek Imagine Cup winners, Giorgos Karakatsiotis and Vangos Pterneas, of [[Megadodo]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} met with the Prime Minister of Greece, [[George Papandreou]], and demonstrated their project that creates personalized descriptions of museum exhibits based on the user's needs.
Teams Xormis and Educ8 from Jamaica were honored with a special luncheon hosted by the Government of Jamaica that included an address from Hon. Bruce Golding, the prime minister. 
Team Think Green had the opportunity to meet with [[Ivo Josipović]], President of [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Microsoft |url=http://www.microsoft.com/croatia/press/predsjednik_studenti.mspx |title=Imagine Cup Croatia |date=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''information processing theory''' approach to the study of [[cognitive development]] evolved out of the American experimental tradition in [[psychology]].  Developmental psychologists who adopt the information-processing perspective account for mental development in terms of maturational changes in basic components of a child’s mind.  The theory is based on the idea that humans process the information they receive, rather than merely responding to stimuli. This perspective equates the mind to a computer, which is responsible for analyzing information from the environment.  According to the standard information-processing model for mental development, the mind’s machinery includes attention mechanisms for bringing information in, [[working memory]] for actively manipulating information, and [[long-term memory]] for passively holding information so that it can be used in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Psychology, Sixth Edition, Worth Publishers, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory addresses how as children grow, their brains likewise mature, leading to advances in their ability to process and respond to the information they received through their senses.  The theory emphasizes a continuous pattern of development, in contrast with Cognitive Developmental theorists such as Jean Piaget that thought development occurred in stages at a time.

==Emergence==
[[Information processing]] as a model for human thinking and learning is part of the resurgence of cognitive perspectives of [[learning]]. The cognitive perspective asserts that complex mental states affect human learning and behavior that such mental states can be scientifically investigated.  Computers, which process information, include internal states that affect processing. Computers, therefore, provided a model for possible human mental states that provided researchers with clues and direction for understanding human thinking and learning as information processing. Overall, information-processing models helped reestablish mental processes that cannot be directly observed as a legitimate area of scientific research.

== Humans as Information Processing Systems ==
Within this model, humans are routinely compared to computers. This comparison is used as a means of better understanding the way information is processed and stored in the human mind. Therefore, when analyzing what actually develops within this model, the more specific comparison is between the human brain and computers. Computers were introduced to the study of development and provided a new way of studying intelligence (Lachman, 1979) and added further legitimacy to the scientific study of the mind (Goodwin, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;411). Information is taken in (or input). Information is encoded to give meaning and compared with stored information. If a person is working on a task, this is where the working memory is enacted. An example of that for a computer is the [[CPU]]. In both cases, information is encoded, given meaning, and combined with previously stored information to enact the task. The latter step is where the information is stored where it can later be retrieved when needed. For computers, this would be akin to saving information on a hard drive, where you would then upload the saved data when working on a future task (using your working memory as in step 2).

==Cognitive processes==
Cognitive processes include [[perception]], recognition, imagining, remembering, thinking, judging, [[reasoning]], [[problem solving]], [[conceptualizing]], and planning. These cognitive processes can emerge from human language, thought, imagery, and [[symbols]].

In addition to these specific cognitive processes, many cognitive psychologists study [[Language acquisition|language-acquisition]], altered states of mind and consciousness, visual perception, auditory perception, [[short-term memory]], [[long-term memory]], storage, retrieval, perceptions of thought and much more.

== Nature versus nurture ==
This theory views humans as actively inputting, retrieving, processing, and storing information. Context, social content, and social influences on processing are simply viewed as information. Nature provides the hardware of cognitive processing and Information Processing theory explains cognitive functioning based on that hardware. Individuals innately vary in some cognitive abilities, such a memory span, but human cognitive systems function similarly based on a set of memory stores that store information and control processes determine how information is processed. The “Nurture” component provides information input (stimuli) that is processed resulting in behavior and learning. Changes in the contents of the long-term memory store (knowledge) are learning. Prior knowledge affects future processing and thus affects future behavior and learning.

== Quantitative versus qualitative ==
Information processing theory combines elements of both quantitative and qualitative development. Qualitative development occurs through the emergence of new strategies for information storage and retrieval, developing representational abilities (such as the utilization of language to represent concepts), or obtaining problem-solving rules (Miller, 2011). Increases in the knowledge base or the ability to remember more items in working memory are examples of quantitative changes, as well as increases in the strength of connected cognitive associations (Miller, 2011). The qualitative and quantitative components often interact together to develop new and more efficient strategies within the processing system.

== Current areas of research ==
Information Processing Theory is currently being utilized in the study of computer or artificial intelligence. This theory has also been applied to systems beyond the individual, including families and business organizations. For example, Ariel (1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ariel|first=Shlomo|date=Fall 1987|title=An information processing theory of family dysfunction|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0085745|journal=Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training|volume=24|pages=477–495|via=PsycARTICLES}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied Information Processing Theory to family systems, with sensing, attending, and encoding of stimuli occurring either within individuals or within the family system itself. Unlike traditional systems theory, where the family system tends to maintain stasis and resists incoming stimuli which would violate the system's rules, the Information Processing family develops individual and mutual schemes which influence what and how information is attended to and processed. Dysfunctions can occur both at the individual level as well as within the family system itself, creating more targets for therapeutic change. Rogers, P. R. et al (1999) utilized Information Processing Theory to describe business organizational behavior, as well as to present a model describing how effective and ineffective business strategies are developed. In their study, components of organizations that "sense" market information are identified as well as how organizations attend to this information; which gatekeepers determine what information is relevant/important for the organization, how this is organized into the existing culture (organizational schemas), and whether or not the organization has effective or ineffective processes for their long-term strategy.

In [[physics]], the '''line of action''' of a [[force]] ''F'' is a geometric representation of how the force is applied. It is the [[line (mathematics)|line]] through the point at which the force is applied in the same direction as the vector {{vec|''F''}}.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

The concept is essential, for instance, for understanding the net effect of multiple forces applied to a body. As an example, if two forces of equal [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] act upon a [[structural rigidity|rigid]] body along the same line of action but in opposite directions, then they have no net effect—loosely speaking, they cancel one another out. But if, instead, their lines of action are not identical, but merely [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]], then their effect is to create a [[Moment (physics)|moment]] on the body, which tends to rotate it.

This list consists of common [[food]]s with their [[cholesterol]] content recorded in [[Kilogram|milligrams]] per 100&amp;nbsp;grams (3.5 [[ounce]]s) of food.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo Clinic [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cholesterol/CL00002 ''Cholesterol: Top 5 foods to lower your numbers''] High cholesterol&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/info/books-phds/books/foodfacts/html/data/data2h.html   Important Basics Food Charts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701044247/http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/info/books-phds/books/foodfacts/html/data/data2h.html |date=2011-07-01 }}  ''cholesterol in foods''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov ''USDA food composition nutrient database'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
[[Cholesterol]] is a [[sterol]], a [[steroid]]-like lipid made by animals, including humans.  The human body makes one-eighth to one-fourth [[teaspoon]]s of pure [[cholesterol]] daily.  A cholesterol level of 5.5 millimoles per litre or below is recommended for an adult.  The rise of cholesterol in the body can give a condition in which excessive cholesterol is deposited in artery walls called [[atherosclerosis]]. This condition blocks the blood flow to vital organs which can result in high blood pressure or stroke. 
Cholesterol is not always bad.  It's a vital part of the cell wall and a precursor to substances such as brain matter and some sex hormones.  There are some types of cholesterol which are beneficial to the heart and blood vessels.  [[High-density lipoprotein]] is commonly called "good" cholesterol.  These lipoproteins help in the removal of cholesterol from the cells, which is then transported back to the liver where it is disintegrated and excreted as waste or broken down into parts.&lt;ref&gt;CholesterolAdvice.net [http://www.cholesteroladvice.net/understanding-cholesterol/ ''Understanding Cholesterol: What is Cholesterol and What Causes High Cholesterol?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microcins''' are very small [[bacteriocin]]s, composed of relatively few [[amino acid]]s.  For this reason, they are distinct from their larger [[protein]] cousins.  The classic example is microcin V, of ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Subtilosin A is another bacteriocin from ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''. The [[peptide]] has a cyclized backbone and forms three cross-links between the sulphurs of Cys13, Cys7 and Cys4 and the alpha-positions of Phe22,Thr28 and Phe31.&lt;ref name="pmid15035610"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kawulka KE, Sprules T, Diaper CM, Whittal RM, McKay RT, Mercier P, Zuber P, Vederas JC | title = Structure of subtilosin A, a cyclic antimicrobial peptide from Bacillus subtilis with unusual sulfur to alpha-carbon cross-links: formation and reduction of alpha-thio-alpha-amino acid derivatives | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 43 | issue = 12 | pages = 3385–95 |date=March 2004 | pmid = 15035610 | doi = 10.1021/bi0359527 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microcins produced by [[commensal]] ''E. coli'' strains target and eliminate [[enteric]] pathogens such as [[Salmonella|''Salmonella'' Enterica]] by mimicking the [[siderophore]]s the pathogens use for iron scavenging. Microcins also help commensal strains of ''E. coli'' outcompete pathogenic strains.&lt;ref&gt; Tine Hesman Saey, [https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-toxic-proteins-help-gut-bacteria-defeat-rivals?mode=topic&amp;context=87 "Tiny toxic proteins help gut bacteria defeat rivals"], ''Science News Magazine Vol. 190, No. 12, December 10, 2016, p. 5''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3586">In [[botany]], an '''obconic''' is an inverted cone shape. The term is most frequently applied to certain fruit or [[hypanthium]] structures with the apical end attached to the stem; however, less frequently the usage may apply to the [[pistil]] structure. In the case of [[fungi]] the designation is often made to the [[ascospore]]. The use of ''obconic'' in botany dates to at least as early as the nineteenth century; however, some modern usage applies to an entire plant form, such as the shape of a whole shrub.&lt;ref&gt;Annette J.G. Wilson, Alexander S. George, Anthony E. Orchard (2001) ''Flora of Australia'', Published by ABRS/CSIRO  {{ISBN|0-643-06720-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, in geometry or design, the term can be assigned in an abstract manner to shapes in the natural or man-made world which show an inverted cone design.

==Botanical examples==
The [[carnivorous plant]] ''[[Nepenthes deaniana]]'' has pitcher elements that are obconic in shape to capture insects.&lt;ref&gt;M.R. Cheek and M.H.P. Jebb (1999) ''Nepenthes'' (Nepenthaceae) in Palawan, Philippines. ''Kew Bulletin'' '''54'''(4): 887–895. {{DOI|10.2307/4111166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hypanthium]] of the western USA plant ''[[Heuchera rubescens]]'' has one [[subspecies]] with an obconic structure, while several other subspecies have alternative hypantium geometries, so that the obconic characteristic is a subspecies determinant and diagnostic.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Linn Jepson and James C. Hickman (1993) ''The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California'', Published by University of California Press, 1400 pages  {{ISBN|0-520-08255-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hypanthium]] of the [[Toyon]] shrub is also generally obconic in shape.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008) ''Toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia)'', GlobalTwitcher, ed. Nicklas Stromberg {{cite web|url=http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid%3D84109%26lang%3Dus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719220426/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=84109&amp;lang=us |archivedate=July 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Asia]]n tree ''[[Eriobotrya]] latifolia'' and several other species within the genus ''[[Eriobotrya]]'' have an obconic [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]], although some individuals manifest [[clavate]] calices.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Dalton Hooker (1879) ''The Flora of British India'', Great Britain India Office, Published by L. Reeve&lt;/ref&gt; The basal portion of the pistil of ''[[Pachypodium baronii]] exhibits the obconic structural design.

As a fungal example the species ''[[Pocillum]] cesatii'' is noted to have an obconic ascospore.&lt;ref&gt;George Massee (1895) ''British Fungus-flora: A Classified Text-book of Mycology''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and historical usage==
The derivation of the word ''obconic'' is based upon the Greek with the common prefix ''ob'', meaning ''inverted'', and the Greek word for angle ''gon'' or ''gonia'', followed by the generic suffix ''ic''.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Urdang, Alexander Humez and Howard G. Zettler (1982) ''Suffixes and Other Word-final Elements of English'', Contributor Laurence Urdang, Published by Gale Research Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically botanists have used the designation ''obconic'' to describe elements of a plant such as the fruit, hypanthium, calyx or pistil base since at least as early as the nineteenth century, and in modern times the term has been generalized to also refer to an entire plant architectural shape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11352">The '''Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World''' ('''OWSD''') (formerly, the Third World Organization for Women in Science (TWOWS) is an international membership organization that provides research training, career development and networking opportunities for women scientists throughout the developing world at different stages in their careers. Its programmes include postgraduate and early career fellowships and annual awards for research excellence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://owsd.net/what-owsd|title=What is OWSD? {{!}} OWSD|website=owsd.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

OWSD was established in 1993. The OWSD Secretariat is based in [[Trieste]], Italy on the campus of the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics|International Center for Theoretical Physics]], and is hosted by [[TWAS|the World Academy of Sciences]] (TWAS), a programme unit of [[UNESCO]].

== Leadership ==
OWSD is governed by an Executive Board, composed of a President, four regional Vice Presidents and four regional Members. The Executive Board is elected by OWSD members at a General Assembly every four years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://owsd.net/structure|title=Structure {{!}} OWSD|website=owsd.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The OWSD Secretariat is headed by the OWSD Programme Coordinator who is given the authority to make decisions and implement operations and programmes according to the direction set by the Executive Board. The Secretariat acts as chief point of contact and liaison between regions and the national chapters, and administers the programmatic activities. 

== History ==
The idea for OWSD was first raised at a conference on The Role of Women in the Development of Science and Technology in the Third World in 1988, organized by the World Academy of Sciences, where more than 200 leading women scientists from 63 developing countries participated. A study group was formed to explore the possibility of creating an organization that would champion the experience, needs and skills of women scientists in the developing world. At a further meeting in Trieste in 1989, the Third World Organization for Women in Science (TWOWS) was established and a constitution adopted. TWOWS was officially launched four years later in 1993, at the First General Assembly in Cairo, Egypt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://owsd.net/about-owsd/history|title=History {{!}} OWSD|website=owsd.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== '''Name Change''' ===
On June 29 2010, members voted to adopt a new name - the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD) - at the organization’s Fourth General Assembly in Beijing, China.

== Funding ==
OWSD is funded by external donors.

The [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (Sida) has supported OWSD financially since 1998 and provides full funding for the postgraduate fellowship programme. 

Since 2010, the Elsevier Foundation has provided funding for the [[Elsevier Foundation Award|OWSD-Elsevier Foundation Awards for Early Career Women Scientists]], given to five women scientists from the developing world each year. 

In 2017, an agreement was signed with Canada’s [[International Development Research Centre]] (IDRC) to fully fund a new OWSD fellowship for Early Career Women Scientists. 

== Membership ==
OWSD has more than 6,000 members from 137 countries.  Over 90% of OWSD members are women living and working in developing countries who have master's or doctorate degrees in scientific subjects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://owsd.net/career-development/membership|title=Membership {{!}} OWSD|website=owsd.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

OWSD has three categories of membership:

* Full members are women scientists from developing countries who have completed a master’s degree or higher in the natural sciences (including engineering, technology and innovation) or social sciences.
* Affiliate members are women scientists from developing countries who have completed a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in the natural sciences or social sciences. 
* Friends of OWSD are women and men from developed and developing countries across all disciplines (including science, social science, arts and humanities) who are committed to promoting the objectives of OWSD and who are not eligible for the Affiliate or Full    membership categories. Friends of OWSD engage with OWSD and its members through support activities such as mentoring, fundraising, networking, and promoting.

=== '''National Chapters''' ===
OWSD has national chapters in 20 countries. National chapters organize regional conferences, seminars and workshops, lead national and regional initiatives for women in science, and provide OWSD members with networking opportunities. National chapters have been established in:

* Bangladesh
* Bolivia
* China
* Cuba
* Egypt
* Ghana
* India
* Indonesia
* Iran
* Kenya
* Mauritius
* Mexico
* Myanmar
* Nigeria
* Rwanda
* South Africa
* Sri Lanka
* Sudan
* Yemen
* Zimbabwe

== Programmes ==

=== '''Postgraduate fellowships''' ===
OWSD postgraduate fellowships are offered to women from selected science and technology-lagging countries in the developing world to undertake PhD research in the natural sciences, including engineering and information technology, at host institutes in another developing country. A small number of fellowships are also available for MSc students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://owsd.net/career-development/phd-fellowship|title=PhD Fellowship {{!}} OWSD|website=owsd.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

These scholarships cover all costs related to undertaking research in a host country that are not covered by the host institute, including travel, visa and health costs, tuition and bench fees as well as a monthly stipend for the awardees' board, accommodation and living expenses. The fellowship also includes additional funding for each PhD fellow to travel to international workshops and conferences of relevance. 

The fellowship is offered as either a full-time (up to 4 years) or sandwich option, in which the fellow is a registered PhD student in her home country and undertakes a maximum of 3 research visits at the host institute for minimum 6 up to 20 months.

More than 240 women scientists have graduated from the fellowship programme with PhDs since 1998. 

The programme is funded by Sida, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.

=== '''Early career fellowships''' ===
The OWSD Early Career Women Scientists (ECWS) fellowship is a prestigious award of up to USD 50,000 offered to women who have completed their PhDs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects and are employed at an academic or scientific research institute in selected science and technology-lagging countries in the developing world. ECWS fellows are supported to continue their research at an international level while based at their home institutes and to build up research groups that will attract international visitors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://owsd.net/career-development/early-career-women-scientists-ecws-fellowships|title=Early Career Women Scientists (ECWS) Fellowships  {{!}} OWSD|website=owsd.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The ECWS fellowship programme is funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada. 

The first cohort of ECWS fellows will be awarded in 2018. 

=== '''OWSD-Elsevier Foundation Awards for Early Career Women Scientists''' ===
The OWSD-Elsevier Foundation Awards are an annual prize given to reward and encourage women scientists working and living in developing countries who are in the early stages of their careers. Initially launched in 2010, the Awards are presented to five scientists each year, one from each of the four OWSD regions plus an additional exceptional winner from any region. The eligible scientific disciplines for the Awards rotate between the biological sciences, physical sciences and engineering. Each winner receives USD 5,000 and presents her research during a special awards ceremony at the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) annual meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://owsd.net/career-development/awards|title=Awards {{!}} OWSD|website=owsd.net|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Awardees must have made a demonstrable impact on the research environment both at a regional and international level.

[[File:WeierstrassFunction.svg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Weierstrass function]] is [[continuous function|continuous]] everywhere but [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] nowhere.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''pathological''' phenomenon is one whose properties are considered atypically bad or [[counterintuitive]]; the opposite is '''well-behaved'''.

==In [[analysis]]==
A classic example of a pathological structure is the [[Weierstrass function]], which is [[continuous function|continuous]] everywhere but [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] nowhere.  The sum of a differentiable function and the Weierstrass function is again continuous but nowhere differentiable; so there are at least as many such functions as differentiable functions. In fact, by the [[Baire category theorem]] one can show that continuous functions are typically or ''generically''{{vague|date=May 2018}} nowhere differentiable.

In [[layman]]'s terms, the majority of functions are nowhere differentiable, and relatively few can ever be described or studied. In general most useful functions also have some sort of physical basis or practical application, which means that they cannot be pathological at the level of hard mathematics or logic; absent certain limiting cases like the [[delta distribution]], they tend to be quite [[well-behaved]] and intuitive. To quote [[Henri Poincaré]]:

{{quote|Logic sometimes makes monsters. For half a century we have seen a mass of bizarre functions which appear to be forced to resemble as little as possible honest functions which serve some purpose. More of continuity, or less of continuity, more derivatives, and so forth. Indeed, from the point of view of logic, these strange functions are the most general; on the other hand those which one meets without searching for them, and which follow simple laws appear as a particular case which does not amount to more than a small corner.

In former times when one invented a new function it was for a practical purpose; today one invents them purposely to show up defects in the reasoning of our fathers and one will deduce from them only that.

If logic were the sole guide of the teacher, it would be necessary to begin with the most general functions, that is to say with the most bizarre. It is the beginner that would have to be set grappling with this [[teratology|teratologic]] museum.|[[Henri Poincaré]]|1899{{vague|date=May 2018}}}}

This highlights the fact that the term ''pathological'' is subjective, context-dependent, and subject to wearing off. Its meaning in any particular case resides in the community of mathematicians, and not necessarily within mathematics itself. Also, the quotation shows how mathematics often progresses via counter-examples to what is thought intuitive or expected; for instance, the "lack of derivatives" mentioned is intimately connected with current study of [[magnetic reconnection]] events in [[solar plasma]].

==In topology==
One of the most notorious pathologies in topology is the [[Alexander horned sphere]], a counterexample showing that topologically embedding the sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; may fail to separate the space cleanly. As a counter-example, it motivated the extra condition of ''tameness'' which suppresses the kind of ''wild'' behaviour the horned sphere exhibits.

Like many other pathologies, the horned sphere in a sense plays on infinitely fine, recursively generated structure, which in the limit violates ordinary intuition. In this case the topology of an ever-descending chain of interlocking loops of continuous pieces of the sphere in the limit fully reflects that of the common sphere, and we'd expect the outside of it, after an embedding, to work the same. Yet it does not: it fails to be [[simply connected]].

For the underlying theory, see [[Jordan–Schönflies theorem]].

== Well-behaved ==
{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
[[Mathematician]]s (and those in related sciences) very frequently speak of whether a [[mathematics|mathematical]] object&amp;mdash;a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], a space of one sort or another&amp;mdash;is '''"well-behaved"'''. The term has no fixed formal definition, and is dependent on context, mathematical interests, fashion, and taste. To ensure that an object is "well-behaved" mathematicians introduce further axioms to narrow down the domain of study. This has the benefit of making analysis easier, but cuts down on the generality of any conclusions reached. Concepts like non-Euclidean geometry were once considered ill-behaved, but are now common objects of study.

In both pure and applied mathematics ([[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], [[numerical integration]], or [[mathematical physics]], for example), ''well-behaved'' also means not violating any assumptions needed to successfully apply whatever analysis is being discussed.

The opposite case is usually labeled pathological. It is not unusual to have situations in which most cases (in terms of [[cardinality]] or [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]) are pathological, but the pathological cases will not arise in practice unless constructed deliberately.

The term "well-behaved" is generally applied in an absolute sense&amp;mdash;either something is well-behaved or it is not. For example:

*In [[algorithmic inference]], a [[well-behaved statistic]] is monotonic, well-defined, and [[Sufficient statistic|sufficient]].
*In [[Bézout's theorem]], two polynomials are well-behaved, and thus the formula given by the theorem for the number of their intersections is valid, if their polynomial greatest common divisor is a constant.
*A [[meromorphic function]] is a ratio of two well-behaved functions, in the sense of those two functions being [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]].
*The [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions]] are first-order necessary conditions for a solution in a well-behaved [[nonlinear programming]] problem to be optimal; a problem is referred to as well-behaved if some regularity conditions are satisfied.
*In [[probability]], events contained in the [[probability space]]'s corresponding [[sigma-algebra]] are well-behaved, as are [[measurable]] functions.

Unusually, the term could also be applied in a comparative sense:

*In [[calculus]]:
**[[Analytic function]]s are better-behaved than general [[smooth function]]s.
**Smooth functions are better-behaved than general differentiable functions.
**Continuous [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] functions are better-behaved than general continuous functions. The larger the number of times the function can be differentiated, the more well-behaved it is.
**[[Continuous function]]s are better-behaved than [[Riemann integration|Riemann-integrable]] functions on compact sets.
**Riemann-integrable functions are better-behaved than [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue-integrable]] functions.
**Lebesgue-integrable functions are better-behaved than general functions.
*In [[topology]], [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] functions are better-behaved than discontinuous ones.
**[[Euclidean space]] is better-behaved than [[non-Euclidean geometry]].
**Attractive [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] are better-behaved than repulsive fixed points.
**[[Hausdorff topology|Hausdorff topologies]] are better-behaved than those in arbitrary [[general topology]].
**[[Borel set]]s are better-behaved than arbitrary [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of [[real number]]s.
**Spaces with [[integer]] dimension are better-behaved than spaces with [[fractal dimension]].
*In [[abstract algebra]]:
**[[Group (mathematics)|Groups]] are better-behaved than [[Magma (algebra)|magmas]] and [[semigroup]]s.
**[[Abelian group]]s are better-behaved than non-Abelian groups.
**[[Finitely-generated abelian group|Finitely-generated Abelian group]]s are better-behaved than non-finitely-generated Abelian groups.
**[[wiktionary:finite|Finite]]-[[dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] [[vector space]]s are better-behaved than [[Infinity|infinite]]-dimensional ones.
**[[Field (mathematics)|Fields]] are better-behaved than [[skew field]]s or general [[ring (mathematics)|rings]].
**Separable [[field extension]]s are better-behaved than non-separable ones.
**[[Normed division algebra]]s are better-behaved than general composition algebras.

Pathological examples often have some undesirable or unusual properties that make it difficult to contain or explain within a theory. Such pathological behaviour often prompts new investigation which leads to new theory and more general results. For example, some important historical examples of this are the following:

*The discovery of [[irrational number]]s by the school of [[Pythagoras]] in ancient Greece; for example, the length of the diagonal of a [[unit square]], that is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
*The [[cardinality]] of the [[rational number]]s is equal to the cardinality of the [[integer]]s.
*Some [[number field]]s have [[ring of integers|rings of integers]] that do not form a [[unique factorization domain]], for example the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-5})&lt;/math&gt;.
*The discovery of [[fractal]]s and other "rough" geometric objects (see [[Hausdorff dimension]]).
*[[Weierstrass function]], a [[real number|real]]-valued function on the [[real line]], that is [[continuous function|continuous]] everywhere but [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] nowhere.
*[[Test functions]] in real analysis and distribution theory, which are [[infinitely differentiable function]]s on the real line that are 0 everywhere outside of a given limited [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]. An example of such a function is the test function,

:: &lt;math&gt;\varphi(t) = \begin{cases} e^{-1/(1-t^2)}, &amp; -1&lt;t&lt;1, \\ 0, &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

*The [[Cantor set]] is a subset of the interval [0, 1] that has [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] zero but is [[uncountable]].
*The Peano [[space-filling curve]] is a continuous [[surjective]] function that maps the unit interval [0, 1] onto [0, 1] &amp;times; [0, 1].
*The [[Dirichlet function]], which is the [[indicator function]] for rationals, is a bounded function that is not [[Riemann integrable]]. 
*The [[Cantor function]] is a [[monotonic]] continuous surjective function that maps [0,1] onto [0,1] but has zero derivative [[almost everywhere]].
*Satisfaction classes containing "intuitively false" arithmetical statements can be constructed for [[countable]], recursively saturated [[model theory|models]] of [[Peano arithmetic]]. {{Citation Needed|date=April 2018}}

At the time of their discovery, each of these was considered highly pathological; today, each has been assimilated into modern mathematical theory. These examples prompt their observers to correct their beliefs or intuitions; sometimes they may even necessitate a reassessment of foundational definitions and concepts. Over the course of history, they have led to more correct, more precise, and more powerful mathematics. For example, the Dirichlet function is Lebesgue integrable, and convolution with test functions is used to approximate any locally integrable function by smooth functions. (The approximations converge [[almost everywhere]] and in the [[space of locally integrable functions]].)

Whether a behavior is pathological is by definition subject to personal intuition. Pathologies depend on context, training, and experience&amp;mdash;what is pathological to one researcher may very well be standard behaviour to another.

Pathological examples can show the importance of the assumptions in a theorem.  For example, in [[statistics]], the [[Cauchy distribution]] does not satisfy the [[central limit theorem]], even though its symmetric [[bell-shape]] appears similar to many distributions which do; it fails the requirement to have a mean and standard deviation which exist and are finite.

Some of the best-known [[paradox]]es such as the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] and [[Hausdorff paradox]] are based on the existence of [[non-measurable set]]s. Mathematicians, unless they take the minority position of denying the [[axiom of choice]], are in general resigned to living with such sets.

==Computer science==
In [[computer science]], ''pathological'' has a slightly different sense with regard to the study of [[algorithm]]s. Here, an input (or set of inputs) is said to be ''pathological'' if it causes atypical behavior from the algorithm, such as a violation of its average case [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]], or even its correctness. For example, [[hash table]]s generally have pathological inputs: sets of keys that [[Hash collision|collide]] on hash values. [[Quicksort]] normally has [[Big O notation|O]](n log n) time complexity, but deteriorates to O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) when given input that triggers suboptimal behaviour.

The term is often used pejoratively, as a way of dismissing such inputs as being specially designed to break a routine that is otherwise sound in practice (compare with ''[[Byzantine failure|Byzantine]]''). On the other hand, awareness of pathological inputs is important as they can be exploited to mount a [[denial-of-service attack]] on a computer system.  Also, the term in this sense is a matter of subjective judgment as with its other senses.  Given enough run time, a sufficiently large and diverse user community, or other factors, an input which may be dismissed as pathological could in fact occur (as seen in the [[Ariane 5 Flight 501|first test flight]] of the [[Ariane 5]]).

== Exceptions ==
{{main|Exceptional object}}
A similar but distinct phenomenon is that of [[exceptional object]]s (and [[exceptional isomorphism]]s), which occurs when there are a "small" number of exceptions to a general pattern—quantitatively, a finite set of exceptions to an otherwise infinite rule. By contrast, in cases of pathology, often most or almost all instances of a phenomenon are pathological, as discussed in [[#Prevalence|prevalence]], above—e.g., almost all real numbers are irrational.

Subjectively, exceptional objects (such as the [[icosahedron]] or [[sporadic simple group]]s) are generally considered "beautiful", unexpected examples of a theory, while pathological phenomena are often considered "ugly", as the name implies. Accordingly, theories are usually expanded to include exceptional objects – for example, the [[exceptional Lie algebra]]s are included in the theory of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s: the axioms are seen as good, the exceptional objects as unexpected but valid. By contrast, pathological examples are instead taken to point out a shortcoming in the axioms, requiring stronger axioms to rule them out – for example, requiring tameness of an embedding of a sphere in the [[Schönflies problem]]. One may study the more general theory, including the pathologies, which may provide its own simplifications (the real numbers have properties very different from the rationals, and likewise continuous maps have very different properties from smooth ones), but will also in general study the narrower theory from which the original examples were drawn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19192">The '''peak–end rule''' is a [[psychological heuristic]] in which people judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak (i.e., its most intense point) and at its end, rather than based on the total sum or average of every moment of the experience. The effect occurs regardless of whether the experience is pleasant or unpleasant. According to the heuristic, other information aside from that of the peak and end of the experience is not lost, but it is not used. This includes net pleasantness or unpleasantness and how long the experience lasted. The peak–end rule is thereby a specific form of the more general [[extension neglect]] and [[duration neglect]].

==Overview==
The peak–end rule is an elaboration on the snapshot model of remembered utility proposed by [[Barbara Fredrickson]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]]. This model dictates that an event is not judged by the entirety of an experience, but by prototypical moments (or ''snapshots'')  as a result of the [[representativeness heuristic]].&lt;ref name="duration_neglect" /&gt; The remembered value of snapshots dominates the actual value of an experience. Fredrickson and Kahneman theorized that these snapshots are actually the average of the most affectively intense moment of an experience and the feeling experienced at the end.&lt;ref name="by_moments" /&gt; The effects of the duration of an experience upon retrospective evaluation are extremely slight. Fredrickson and Kahneman labeled this phenomenon ''duration neglect''.&lt;ref name="duration_neglect" /&gt; The peak–end rule is applicable only when an experience has definite beginning and end periods.

==Research and examples==

A 1993 study titled "When More Pain Is Preferred to Less: Adding a Better End" by Kahneman, Fredrickson, Charles Schreiber, and Donald Redelmeier provided groundbreaking evidence for the peak–end rule. Participants were subjected to two different versions of a single unpleasant experience. The first trial had subjects submerge a hand in 14&amp;nbsp;°C water for 60 seconds. The second trial had subjects submerge the other hand in 14&amp;nbsp;°C water for 60 seconds, but then keep their hand submerged for an additional 30 seconds, during which the temperature was raised to 15&amp;nbsp;°C. Subjects were then offered the option of which trial to repeat. Against the law of [[temporal monotonicity]], subjects were more willing to repeat the second trial, despite a prolonged exposure to uncomfortable temperatures. Kahneman et al. concluded that "subjects chose the long trial simply because they liked the memory of it better than the alternative (or disliked it less)."&lt;ref name=more_pain /&gt;

Similarly, a 1996 study by Kahneman and Redelmeier assessed patients' appraisals of uncomfortable [[colonoscopy]] or [[lithotripsy]] procedures and correlated the remembered experience with real-time findings. They found that patients consistently evaluated the discomfort of the experience based on the intensity of pain at the worst (peak) and final (end) moments. This occurred regardless of length or variation in intensity of pain within the procedure.&lt;ref name=pain /&gt;

Another study by Kahneman and [[Ziv Carmon]] identified a boundary condition for the peak–end rule. Participants interacted with a computer program that had them wait to be served, while assessing their satisfaction as they were waiting. Kahneman and Carmon found that how participants felt at the final moment of the experience was a good predictor of their responses when they were asked to retrospectively evaluate their experiences. For example, participants who felt very dissatisfied during much of the experience but were satisfied in the final few seconds (because the waiting line moved faster than expected toward the end) summarized the experience as satisfying. Kahneman and Carmon concluded that real time experiences that are based on expectations are discounted after the fact if those expectations are unfulfilled.&lt;ref name="simulated_queues" /&gt;

A third study by Kahneman, Redelmeier, and Joel Katz corroborated and expanded upon the discoveries made in the 1996 study. Colonoscopy patients were randomly divided into two groups. One underwent a colonoscopy procedure wherein the scope was left in for three extra minutes, but not moved, creating a sensation that was uncomfortable, but not painful. The other group underwent a typical colonoscopy procedure. Kahneman et al. found that, when asked to retrospectively evaluate their experiences, patients who underwent the longer procedure rated their experience as less unpleasant than patients who underwent the typical procedure. Moreover, the patients in the prolonged discomfort group were far more likely to return for subsequent procedures because a less painful end led them to evaluate the procedure more positively than those who faced a shorter procedure.&lt;ref name="memories_of_colonoscopy" /&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Memory bias for more emotional events (i.e., why the peak is memorable) ===
People exhibit better memory for more intensely emotional events than less intensely emotional events. The precise cause of this is unclear, but it has been demonstrated, for decades, across a wide variety of surveys and experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Retention of affective material: Effects of intensity of affect on retrieval.|url = |journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 64–80|volume = 23|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/h0032790|first = Satrajit|last = Dutta|first2 = Rabindra N.|last2 = Kanungo|first3 = Vaira|last3 = Freibergs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ochsner2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ochsner|first1=Kevin N.|title=Are affective events richly recollected or simply familiar?

This failure to correct for the atypicality of extreme memories can lead people to believe those extreme moments are representative of the "set" being judged. [[Boston Red Sox]] fans asked to recall any one game they saw when the Red Sox won, for example, tended to recall the best game they could remember. They only realized this game was unrepresentative of past winning games by the Red Sox if they were explicitly asked to recall the best game they could remember, as evidenced by their subsequent [[Affective forecasting|''affective forecasts'']].&lt;ref name="Morewedge2005" /&gt; This bias for more intense emotional experiences is evident in ''[[Nostalgia|nostalgic preferences]]''. People asked to recall a television show or movie from the past tend to recall the most enjoyable show or movie that they can remember, and use this extreme example to rate all shows from its era unless they are also able to spontaneously recall shows or movies that are worse than the first show or movie they remember.&lt;ref name=Morewedge2013&gt;{{Cite journal|title = It Was a Most Unusual Time: How Memory Bias Engenders Nostalgic Preferences|url = |journal = Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date = 2013|pages = 319–326|volume = 26|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/bdm.1767|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recency bias in memory (i.e., why the end is memorable) ===
People exhibit serial position effects such that they have better memory for ''both'' the beginning and end of sequences, phenomena known as [[Primacy effect|primacy bias]] and [[recency bias]], respectively. A paper by Garbinsky, Morewedge, and Shiv (2014) found evidence that for extended hedonic experiences, better memory for the end of the experience than the beginning (recency &gt; primacy) can be attributed to memory [[Interference theory|interference effects]].&lt;ref name=Garbinsky2014&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Interference of the End Why Recency Bias in Memory Determines When a Food Is Consumed Again|url = |journal = Psychological Science|date = 2014|pmid = 24894582|pages = 1466–1474|volume = 25|issue = 7|doi = 10.1177/0956797614534268|first = Emily N.|last = Garbinsky|first2 = Carey K.|last2 = Morewedge|first3 = Baba|last3 = Shiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a person eats potato chips, for example, the formation of a new memory of the most recently eaten chip makes it harder for them to recall how the previously eaten chips tasted. Garbinsky and colleagues found that (1) recency effects better predicted recalled enjoyment of a small meal (e.g., eating 5 or 15 chips) than did primacy effects, (2) that people had a worse memory for the first bite of the meal than the last bite of the meal, but (3) providing people with their ratings of the first bite lead them to use their enjoyment of that first bite as much as their enjoyment of the last bite when rating their overall enjoyment of the meal.

==Applications==

===Business===
Since most consumer interactions have set beginnings and ends, they fit the peak–end model. As a consequence, negative occurrences in any consumer interaction can be counteracted by establishing a firmly positive peak and end. This can be accomplished through playing music customers enjoy, giving out free samples, or paying a clerk to hold the door for patrons as they leave. As Scott Stratten has suggested, "A really great salesperson who helps with an exchange can erase negative experiences along the way. The long wait in line and the bad music in the changing room are forgotten".&lt;ref name="StrattenKramer2012" /&gt; However, as research by Talya Miron-Shatz suggests, retrospective evaluations of day-long experiences do not appear to follow the peak–end rule, which brings into question the applicability of this rule to approximately day-length consumer–business interactions, such as hotel stays.&lt;ref name="boundary_conditions" /&gt;

===Vacations===
In 2006, a study was carried out at the [[University of Canterbury]] in Christchurch, New Zealand, analyzing the implications of the peak–end rule on the perceived happiness experienced on vacations. The study found that participants' remembered overall happiness was approximately predicted by the peak–end rule, although it was actually better predicted by their happiness during the "most memorable or most unusual 24-h period".&lt;ref name=KempBurtFurneaux2006 /&gt; Still, the duration of a vacation appeared to have negligible effects on remembered happiness.&lt;ref name=KempBurtFurneaux2006/&gt; The results of the study could be applied to choosing more economical durations for vacations.

===Medical procedures===
The peak–end rule is particularly salient in regard to medical procedures, since it suggests that it is preferable to have longer procedures that include a period of decreased discomfort than to have shorter procedures.&lt;ref name="boundary_conditions" /&gt; In particular, the rule "suggests that the memory of a painful medical treatment is likely to be less aversive if relief from the pain is gradual than if relief is abrupt".&lt;ref name=more_pain /&gt; Furthermore, the quality of a remembered procedure can drastically influence medical futures. If people recall necessary but onerous procedures more positively, then they are more likely to return for repeat procedures later in life.
However, factoring the effect of the peak–end rule upon evaluations of medical procedures is problematic, since adding a period of decreasing pain to a procedure is still added pain.  Even though this certainly yields a better memory of the process, the patient still endures more pain than is strictly necessary.&lt;ref name="memories_of_colonoscopy" /&gt; Doctors and patients are forced to confront the choice between objectively less painful forms of treatment and forms of treatment that will be remembered more favorably. Kahneman claims that "it is safe to assume that few patients will agree to expose themselves to pain for the sole purpose of improving a future memory".&lt;ref name=more_pain /&gt;

==Criticism==
Critiques of the peak–end rule typically derive from its conflation of a complex mental evaluation into a simplistic framework. A 2008 study found some support for the peak–end rule, but also found that it was "not an outstandingly good predictor" of remembered experiential value, and that the happiness of the most memorable part of an experience predicted remembered happiness better than did the happiness of the peak or of the end.&lt;ref name=KempBurtFurneaux2006/&gt; Additionally, the extreme effect of peaks fades more rapidly over time, causing peaks to be recalled less positively and troughs recalled less negatively over time. [[Episodic memory]] endures for only a few weeks; at some point, mental accounting shifts over to [[semantic memory]], leading to potential over-valuation of the "end" and diminished weighting of the peak.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Additionally, memories that are available for evaluation may change due to the fading affect associated with memory or differing goals in recall.&lt;ref name=KempBurtFurneaux2006/&gt; Goal orientation or initial expectations can also affect the weighting of a peak or an end, causing an end to be over-weighted as the culmination of a goal.&lt;ref name="by_moments" /&gt; Finally, Ariely and Carmon have theorized that evaluations of past events are affected by feelings at the time of evaluation.&lt;ref name=ArielyCarmon2000/&gt;

[[Image:Paw output.gif|thumb|PAW screen capture]]
The '''Physics Analysis Workstation''' (PAW) is an interactive, scriptable computer software tool for data analysis and graphical presentation in [[High Energy Physics]] (HEP). 

The development of this software tool started at [[CERN]] in 1986, it was optimized for the processing very large amounts of data. It was based on and intended for inter-operation with components of [[CERN Program Library|CERNLIB]], an extensive collection of [[Fortran]] libraries. 

PAW had been a standard tool in high energy physics for decades, yet was essentially unmaintained.&lt;ref&gt;http://cernlib.web.cern.ch/cernlib/news/future.html&lt;/ref&gt; Despite continuing popularity as of 2008, it has been losing ground to the [[C++]]-based [[ROOT]] package. Conversion tutorials exist.&lt;ref&gt;https://root.cern.ch/root/HowtoConvertFromPAW.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, development and support were stopped.&lt;ref&gt;https://paw.web.cern.ch/paw/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample script==

PAW uses its own scripting language. Here's a sample code (with its actual output), which can be used to plot data gathered in files.

&lt;pre&gt;
* read data
vector/read X,Y input_file.dat

* eps plot

'''Public transport planning''' or '''transit planning''' is the professional discipline responsible for developing [[public transport]] systems &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ceder|first1=Avishai|title=Public Transit Planning and Operation: Modeling, Practice and Behavior, 2nd ed|date=2015|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-6391-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; . It is a hybrid discipline involving aspects of [[transport engineering]] and traditional [[urban planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Xie|first1=Feng|last2=Levinson|first2=David L.|title=Evolving Transportation Networks|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-44-19-9803-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many transit planners find themselves involved in discourse with urban-land-use issues such as [[transit-oriented development]].

Transit planners are responsible for developing routes and networks of routes for urban transit systems. These may follow one or more models depending on the character of the communities they serve. For example, in urban areas, a system may attract enough [[Patronage (transportation)|ridership]] to support high frequencies of service. At these high frequencies, services can operate at demand service levels where the specific frequency of service in each [[Transport corridor|corridor]] can be independent and where transfers can reasonably occur at random. In less densely developed areas service may operate somewhat infrequently. To optimize the quality of trips for customers, some systems compensate by operating a [[timed-transfer]] system. In this model, routes are designed to bring [[bus]]es (or [[train]]s or [[ferries]]) together at a central location at predetermined times. Customers then transfer between the vehicles which leave a few minutes later. In systems committed to this system, routes are designed to take travel time into account.

In addition to serving customers' transportation needs, transit planners often consider transportation projects' other impacts. Economic impacts, directly on providers and consumers, on local economies, and on the aggregate level in large economic spheres, often feature prominently in deciding between different projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhatta|first1=Saurav Dev|last2=Drennan|first2=Matthew P.|title=The Economic Benefits of Public Investment in Transportation: A Review of Recent Literature|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|date=March 1, 2003|volume=22|issue=3|pages=288–296|doi=10.1177/0739456X02250317}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, concerns about environmental quality have produced a growing interest in developing sustainable transportation and transit planning has evolved to reflect these new concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutton|first1=Barry|title=Planning Sustainable Transport|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-1-84971-391-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, impacts on social equity have been paid increasing attention by transit planners in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deakin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Sustainable Development and Sustainable Transportation: Strategies for Economic Prosperity, Environmental Quality, and Equity|journal=Institute of Urban &amp; Regional Development|date=May 1, 2001|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0m1047xc|accessdate=2017-02-19&lt;!-- 13:46:01--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RRS ''Bransfield''''' was an ice-strengthened cargo vessel, purpose-built for the [[British Antarctic Survey]] (BAS).

==History==
RRS ''Bransfield'' was designed by consultants Graham &amp; Woolnaugh of Liverpool for [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]], and built by [[Henry Robb|Robb Caledon Shipbuilders Ltd]], Leith. She was named after [[Edward Bransfield]] RN (1785-1852), who discovered the north west coast of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], roughly surveyed the [[South Shetland Islands]], claiming [[King George Island (Antarctica)|King George Island]] and [[Clarence Island (South Shetland Islands)|Clarence Island]] for Great Britain. Bransfield was the first man to chart part of the Antarctic mainland.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

This was the second vessel to be named after Bransfield by BAS or its predecessors. The first was HMS ''Bransfield'', the original expedition ship for [[Operation Tabarin]], a secret British expedition to Antarctica during World War Two. It established the first permanent British bases on the Antarctic Peninsula and became the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]] in 1945 (renamed BAS in 1962). This vessel was a wooden Norwegian sealer built in 1918 as the Veslekari, and renamed for the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.warsailors.com/freefleet/norfleetv.html#veslekari| title=Norwegian Merchant Fleet 1939-1945| accessdate=2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her service with Tabarin was inglorious - she proved to be unseaworthy, and had to be replaced before the expedition left English waters in November 1943.

In 1993/94, while in the [[Weddell Sea]] ''Bransfield'' suffered an engine room fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/documents/cruise/JR039-a-report.pdf| format=pdf| title=JR39a Cruise Report| publisher=[[British Antarctic Survey]]| accessdate=2009-04-13| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607102503/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/documents/cruise/JR039-a-report.pdf| archivedate=7 June 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1999, she was sold to [[GC Rieber Shipping]] as part of the contract for the long-term charter of her replacement, {{ship|RRS|Ernest Shackleton}}. She was subsequently renamed ''Igenpearl'', and was scrapped in [[Mumbai]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="scrap"/&gt;

==Service==
RRS ''Bransfield'' was BAS's main supply vessel for 29 years, from 1970/71 to 1998/99. She also had limited facilities for on-board research. There was a fully equipped hospital bay on board.&lt;ref name="dart"/&gt;

For much of her career her joint Masters were John Cole and Stewart Laurence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://aadc-maps.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=123683| title=Cole Channel| publisher=Antarctic Gazetteer| accessdate=2007-08-30| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926230013/http://aadc-maps.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=123683| archivedate=26 September 2007| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/basclub/fuchsmedal2003.html |title=Stuart Lawrence - Fuchs Medallist 2003 |publisher=BAS Club |accessdate=2007-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227071939/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/basclub/fuchsmedal2003.html |archivedate=27 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bransfield'' represented NERC in the Review of the Fleet at [[Spithead]] in 1977, held to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's jubilee.

|}'''RV ''Maurice Ewing''''' was a [[research vessel]] operated by the [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] of [[Columbia University]].  It was retired in 2005 and replaced by [[RV Marcus Langseth|RV ''Marcus Langseth'']] in 2008.  Although a multipurpose vessel, ''Maurice Ewing''{{'}}s notable capability was to collect [[reflection seismology|multichannel seismic]] data.

''Maurice Ewing'' was named for [[Maurice Ewing|William Maurice "Doc" Ewing]], [[geophysicist]] and first director of Lamont Geological Observatory (now known as Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory).

The vessel was later renamed several times: - Scan Resolution, Bergan Resolution, the Reflect Resolution, and the NORDIC BAHARI. Still to this day the vessel operates as a multi-streamer seismic research vessel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8781">The '''STEPS Centre''' (Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) is an interdisciplinary global research and policy engagement hub at the [[University of Sussex]]. It is funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]]. The Centre brings together [[development studies]] with [[science and technology studies]] and was launched at [[Portcullis House]] in London on 25 June 2007 &lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,2111237,00.html STEPS towards better development by Mark Tran, The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

By acknowledging the interactions between social, technological and environmental factors in diverse local settings the STEPS Centre seeks to help create more sustainable and socially just conditions for poorer people. Based at the [[Institute of Development Studies]] (IDS) and the [[Science Policy Research Unit]] ([[SPRU]]) at the [[University of Sussex]] in the UK, the Centre works with partners in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Professor Ian Scoones &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/person/ian-scoones IDS Profile for Ian Scoones]&lt;/ref&gt; is the director of the STEPS Centre and Professor [[Andy Stirling]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/300596/Path-finder.htm Path-finder by Andrew Lee, The Engineer, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829000212/http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/300596/Path-finder.htm |date=29 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; its co-director.

To know what's happening around the world, you must ask the locals by Jessica Shepherd, The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/wpsite/wp-content/uploads/ML_-Lunch-with-the-Lancet_-Vol-371-June-21-2008.pdf Perspectives by Priya Shetty, The Lancet, Jun 2008]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; stepped down as STEPS Director in 2014 to become Director of the [[Institute of Development Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/2013/blog/melissa-leach-ids-director/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advisory board ==

The STEPS Centre Advisory Board is chaired by Mike Hulme ([[King's College London]]) with members including [[Brian Wynne]] (CESAGEN, [[University of Lancaster]]), Carl Folke ([[Stockholm Resilience Centre]]), Dipak Gyawali ([[Nepal Academy of Science and Technology]]), [[Fred Pearce]] (science writer), [[Sue Hartley]] (Director, York Environmental Sustainability Institute), [[Suman Sahai]] (Convenor, [[Gene Campaign]]), and [https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaslingard Thomas Lingard] (Global External Affairs Director, [[Unilever]]).

== Areas of work ==

The STEPS Centre brings together [[social scientists]] and [[natural science|natural scientists]] to work together to try and achieve a breakthrough in thinking and action for development. The Centre's unique ‘pathways’ approach interweaves social, technological and environmental conditions with dynamic change &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/CP/the_edge/issue27/pathways.aspx?ComponentId=26077&amp;SourcePageId=26118 Building genuine pathways to a more secure future, ESRC Today]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; across three domains - food and agriculture; health and disease; water and sanitation - and three themes - dynamics; governance; designs.

Through linking across domains and themes in its projects, the STEPS Centre connects new theory with practical approaches in a bid to help provide sustainable opportunities for poor and marginalised people.

== Pathways approach ==

The STEPS Centre's pathways approach aims to understand the complex, non-linear interactions between social, technological and environmental systems. Some pathways may threaten poor peoples’ livelihoods and health while others create opportunities for sustainability.

The Centre aims to link social scientists, natural scientists and users to develop new tools and methods linking theory with practical solutions. It also offers teaching, in conjunction with IDS and SPRU, to help train a new generation of researchers on MA and PhD courses.

A paper published in 2007 entitled Pathways to Sustainability: an Overview of the STEPS Centre Approach &lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/wpsite/wp-content/uploads/final_steps_overview.pdf Pathways to Sustainability: An overview of the STEPS Centre's Approach]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined the STEPS Centre approach to understanding dynamic systems and their governance. The paper laid out the ingredients of the STEPS Centre's work, including linking diverse social and natural science perspectives, connecting theory, policy and practice and an engaged, interactive approach to communications. Promoting pathways to Sustainability that meet the perspectives and priorities of poor and marginalised groups is at the heart of the pathways approach.

[[File:Soyuz-TMA parts.jpg|thumb|Diagram showing the three elements of the Soyuz-TMA spacecraft.]]

The '''Soyuz-TMA''' is a revision of the [[Soyuz spacecraft]], superseded in 2010 by the '''[[#Soyuz TMA-M|Soyuz TMA-M]]'''. 
(T – транспортный – ''Transportnyi'' – meaning transport, M – модифицированный – ''Modifitsirovannyi'' – meaning modified, A – антропометрический, – ''Antropometricheskii'' meaning [[Anthropometry|anthropometric]]). 
It is used by the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] for [[human spaceflight]]. The spacecraft features several changes to accommodate requirements requested by [[NASA]] in order to service the [[International Space Station]], including more latitude in the height and weight of the crew and improved parachute systems. It is also the first expendable vehicle to feature a "[[glass cockpit]]". Soyuz-TMA looks identical to the earlier [[Soyuz-TM]] spacecraft on the outside, but interior differences allow it to accommodate taller occupants with new adjustable crew couches.

== Design ==

A Soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts (from front to back):

* A [[spheroid]] [[orbital module]]
* A small aerodynamic [[reentry capsule|reentry module]]
* A cylindrical [[service module]] with solar panels attached

The first two portions are habitable living space. By moving as much as possible into the orbital module, which does not have to be shielded or decelerated during [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] re-entry, the Soyuz three-part craft is both larger and lighter than the two-part [[Apollo spacecraft]]'s [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command module]]. The Apollo command module had six cubic meters of living space and a mass of 5000&amp;nbsp;kg; the three-part Soyuz provided the same crew with nine cubic meters of living space, an airlock, and a service module for the mass of the Apollo capsule alone. This does not consider the orbital module, that could be used instead of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]].

Soyuz can carry up to three [[astronaut|cosmonauts]] and provide life support for them for about 30 person days. The life support system provides a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures. The atmosphere is regenerated through [[KO2|KO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] cylinders, which absorb most of the [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[water]] produced by the crew and regenerates the oxygen, and [[LiOH]] cylinders which absorb leftover CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The vehicle is protected during launch by a nose fairing, which is jettisoned after passing through the atmosphere. It has an automatic docking system. The ship can be operated automatically, or by a pilot independently of ground control.

=== Orbital Module (BO) ===

[[File:Soyuz-TMA orbital module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Orbital Module]]

The forepart of the spacecraft is the orbital module ({{ru icon}}: бытовой отсек (BO), ''Bitovoy otsek'') also known as Habitation section. It houses all the equipment that will not be needed for reentry, such as experiments, cameras or cargo. Commonly, it is used as both eating area and lavatory. At its far end, it also contains the docking port. This module also contains a toilet, docking avionics and communications gear. On the latest Soyuz versions, a small window was introduced, providing the crew with a forward view.

A hatch between it and the descent module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed, cosmonauts exiting through its side port (at the bottom of this picture, near the descent module) on the launch pad, they have entered the spacecraft through this port.

This separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life-critical descent module. The convention of orientation in zero gravity differs from that of the descent module, as cosmonauts stand or sit with their heads to the docking port.

=== Reentry Module (SA) ===

[[File:Soyuz-TMA descent module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Descent Module]]
The reentry module ({{ru icon}}: спускаемый аппарат (СА), ''Spuskaemiy apparat (SA)'') is used for launch and the journey back to Earth. It is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during [[re-entry]]. It is slowed initially by the atmosphere, then by a braking parachute, followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing. At one meter above the ground, solid-fuel braking engines mounted behind the [[heat shield]] are fired to give a soft landing. One of the design requirements for the reentry module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency (internal volume divided by hull area). The best shape for this is a sphere, but such a shape can provide no lift, which results in a purely [[ballistic reentry]]. Ballistic reentries are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and can't be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn. That is why it was decided to go with the "headlight" shape that the Soyuz uses&amp;nbsp;— a hemispherical forward area joined by a barely angled conical section (seven degrees) to a classic spherical section heat shield. This shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution. The nickname was coined at a time when nearly every automobile headlight was a circular paraboloid.

=== Service Module (PAO) ===

[[File:Soyuz-TMA propulsion module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Instrumentation/Propulsion Module]]
At the back of the vehicle is the service module ({{ru icon}}: приборно-агрегатный отсек, ''Priborno-Agregatniy Otsek (PAO)''). It has an instrumentation compartment ({{ru icon}}: приборный отсек, ''Priborniy Otsek (PO)''), a pressurized container shaped like a bulging can that contains systems for temperature control, electric power supply, long-range [[radio]] communications, radio telemetry, and instruments for orientation and control. The propulsion compartment ({{ru icon}}: агрегатный отсек, ''Agregatniy Otsek (AO)''), a non-pressurized part of the service module, contains the main engine and a spare: liquid-fuel [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion systems]] for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to Earth. The ship also has a system of low-thrust engines for orientation, attached to the intermediate compartment ({{ru icon}}: переходной отсек, ''Perekhodnoi Otsek (PkhO)''). Outside the service module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array, which is oriented towards the sun by rotating the ship.

=== Re-entry procedure ===

Because its modular construction differs from that of previous designs, the Soyuz has an unusual sequence of events prior to re-entry. The spacecraft is turned engine-forward and the main engine is fired for de-orbiting fully 180° ahead of its planned landing site. This requires the least propellant for re-entry, the spacecraft traveling on an elliptical [[Hohmann orbit]] to a point where it will be low enough in the atmosphere to re-enter.

Early Soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously. As they are connected by tubing and electrical cables to the descent module, this would aid in their separation and avoid having the descent module alter its orientation. Later Soyuz spacecraft detach the orbital module before firing the main engine, which saves even more propellant, enabling the descent module to return more payload. In no case can the orbital module remain in orbit as an addition to a space station, for the hatch enabling it to function as an airlock is part of the descent module.

Re-entry firing is typically done on the "dawn" side of the Earth, so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening twilight, illuminated by the sun when it is above the shadow of the Earth. Since the beginning of Soyuz missions to the ISS, only five have performed nighttime landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://spaceflight101.com/iss-expedition-45/soyuz-trio-set-for-rare-nighttime-landing-on-friday/ |title= Soyuz Trio set for rare Nighttime Landing on Friday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final planned flight of the baseline Soyuz-TMA design was [[Soyuz TMA-22]], launched November 14, 2011 from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]'s [[Gagarin's Start]] launch pad in [[Kazakhstan]], at 04:14:03 UTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/station/exp29/111113launch/ |title=Three men fly Soyuz capsule to space from snowy pad |author=William Harwood |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new modernized '''Soyuz TMA-M'''{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} series was developed and built by [[RKK Energia]] as an upgrade of the baseline Soyuz-TMA. Thirty-six obsolete pieces of equipment have been replaced with 19 new-generation devices and the vehicle's total mass has been reduced by 70 kilograms (154&amp;nbsp;lbs).&lt;ref name="rian_infograph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/infographics/20100929/160755007.html|title=Soyuz TMA-M – a new series of the legendary Soyuz spacecrafts|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the reliable but heavy (70&amp;nbsp;kg) [[Argon digital computer]]&lt;ref name="russian_computer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/argon16.htm|title=Argon-16 Computer.

The modernized Soyuz will also enable engineers to test new equipment which may also be used in Russia's [[Prospective Piloted Transport System|next generation manned space ship]] that is currently under development.&lt;ref name="energia_overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energia.ru/en/iss/soyuz-tma-m/soyuz-tma-m.html|title=Soyuz TMA-M manned transport vehicle of a new series – General Data|publisher=RKK Energia|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA astronaut [[Scott Kelly (astronaut)|Scott Kelly]], part of Soyuz TMA-01M's crew, praised the ship's new displays, saying that they make flying easier and less operator intensive.&lt;ref name="spaceflightnow_launch"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/station/exp25/101007launch/|title=Three men launched into space for half-year voyage|publisher=SpaceflightNow|date=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two flight development flights were launched: [[Soyuz TMA-01M]] on Oct 7, 2010 and [[Soyuz TMA-02M]] on Jun 7, 2011. The third ship, [[Soyuz TMA-03M]], launched on 21 December 2011 and was used for qualification tests. In addition to verifying the nominal operation of the spaceship, the testing included verification of off-nominal modes, such as manual attitude control, issuing of orbital maneuvering pulses using four berthing and attitude thrusters, and flying around the ISS in manual control mode.&lt;ref name="energia_tests"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energia.ru/en/iss/soyuz-tma-m/soyuz-tma-m_02.html|title=Soyuz TMA-M manned transport vehicle of a new series – Flight tests|publisher=RKK Energia|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TMA-M variant flew 20 missions at a cadence of four times a year before being replaced in 2016 by the [[Soyuz MS]]. For the launch schedule, see [[List of Russian manned space missions]].

Latitude 40° N (approximately New York City, Madrid and Beijing) is highlighted for reference]]{{More citations needed|date=June 2018}}

The '''sunrise equation''' as follows can be used to derive the time of [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]] for any [[solar declination]] and [[latitude]] in terms of local solar time when [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]] actually occur:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \omega_\circ = -\tan \phi \times \tan \delta &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_\circ&lt;/math&gt; is the [[hour angle]] at either [[sunrise]] (when ''negative'' value is taken) or [[sunset]] (when ''positive'' value is taken);
:&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[latitude]] of the observer on the [[Earth]];
:&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the sun [[declination]].

== Theory of the equation ==
The [[Earth]] rotates at an [[angular velocity]] of 15°/hour. Therefore, the expression &lt;math&gt;\omega_\circ \times \frac{\mathrm{hour}}{{15}^\circ}&lt;/math&gt; gives the interval of time before and after local [[solar noon]] that [[sunrise]] or [[sunset]] will occur.

The sign convention is typically that the observer latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is 0 at the [[equator]], positive for the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and negative for the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the solar declination &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is 0 at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes when the sun is exactly above the equator, positive during the Northern Hemisphere summer and negative during the Northern Hemisphere winter.

The expression above is always applicable for latitudes between the [[Arctic Circle]] and [[Antarctic Circle]]. North of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle, there is at least one day of the year with no sunrise or sunset. Formally, there is a sunrise or sunset when &lt;math&gt;-90^\circ+\delta &lt; \phi &lt; 90^\circ - \delta&lt;/math&gt; during the Northern Hemisphere summer, and when &lt;math&gt;-90^\circ - \delta &lt; \phi &lt; 90^\circ + \delta&lt;/math&gt; during the Northern Hemisphere winter. Out of these latitudes, it is either 24-hour [[day]]time or 24-hour [[nighttime]].

== Generalized equation ==
Also note that the equation above neglects the influence of [[atmospheric refraction]] (which lifts the solar disc by approximately 0.6° when it is on the horizon) and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc (about 0.5°). The times of the rising and the setting of the upper solar limb as given in astronomical almanacs correct for this by using the more general equation

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \omega_\circ = \dfrac{\sin a - \sin \phi \times \sin \delta}{\cos \phi \times \cos \delta }&lt;/math&gt;

with the [[altitude]] (a) of the center of the solar disc set to about −0.83° (or −50 arcminutes).

== Complete calculation on Earth ==
The generalized equation relies on a number of other variables which need to be calculated before it can itself be calculated. These equations have the solar-earth constants substituted with angular constants expressed in degrees.

=== Calculate current Julian day ===
:&lt;math&gt;n = J_{date} - 2451545.0 + 0.0008&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of days since Jan 1st, 2000 12:00.
:&lt;math&gt;J_{date}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Julian day|Julian date]];
:2451545.0 is the equivalent [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] of Julian days for 2000, 1, 1.5.
:0.0008 is the fractional Julian Day for [[leap seconds]] and [[terrestrial time]].
:currently = 68.184 / 86400 without [[DUT1]].

=== Mean solar noon ===

:&lt;math&gt;J^{\star} = n - \dfrac{l_w}{360^\circ}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;J^{\star}&lt;/math&gt; is an approximation of [[mean solar time]] at &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; expressed as a Julian day with the day fraction.
:&lt;math&gt;l_\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the longitude west (west is negative, east is positive) of the observer on the Earth;

=== Solar mean anomaly ===

:&lt;math&gt;M = (357.5291 + 0.98560028 \times J^{\star}) \mod 360&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:M is the solar [[mean anomaly]] used in a few of next equations.

=== Equation of the center ===

:&lt;math&gt;C = 1.9148 \sin(M) + 0.0200 \sin(2 M) + 0.0003 \sin(3 M)&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:C is the [[Equation of the center]] value needed to calculate lambda (see next equation).
:1.9148 is the coefficient of the Equation of the Center for the planet the observer is on (in this case, Earth)

=== Ecliptic longitude ===

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = (M + C + 180 + 102.9372) \mod 360&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:λ is the [[ecliptic longitude]].
:102.9372 is a value for the [[argument of perihelion]].

=== Solar transit ===

:&lt;math&gt;J_{transit} = 2451545.0+J^{\star} + 0.0053 \sin M - 0.0069 \sin \left( 2 \lambda \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where:

:J&lt;sub&gt;transit&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Julian date]] for the local true solar transit (or [[solar noon]]).
:2451545.0 is noon of the equivalent [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] reference.
:&lt;math&gt;0.0053 \sin M - 0.0069 \sin \left( 2 \lambda \right) &lt;/math&gt; is a simplified version of the [[equation of time]]. The coefficients are fractional day minutes.

=== Declination of the Sun ===

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \delta = \sin \lambda \times \sin 23.44^\circ &lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[declination]] of the sun.
:23.44° is Earth's maximum axial tilt toward the sun &lt;ref&gt;https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hour angle ===

''This is the equation from above with corrections for astronomical refraction and solar disc diameter.''

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \omega_\circ = \dfrac{\sin(-0.83^\circ) - \sin \phi \times \sin \delta}{\cos \phi \times \cos \delta}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:ω&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[hour angle]] from the observer's [[zenith]];
:&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the north latitude of the observer (north is positive, south is negative) on the Earth.

For observations on a sea horizon an elevation-of-observer correction, add &lt;math&gt;-1.15^\circ\sqrt{\text{elevation in feet}}/60^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;-2.076^\circ\sqrt{\text{elevation in metres}}/60^\circ&lt;/math&gt; to the −0.83° in the numerator's sine term. This corrects for both apparent dip and terrestrial refraction. For example, for an observer at 10,000 feet, add (−115°/60°) or about −1.92° to −0.83°.

=== Calculate sunrise and sunset ===
:&lt;math&gt;J_{set} = J_{transit} + \dfrac{\omega_\circ}{360^\circ}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J_{rise} = J_{transit} - \dfrac{\omega_\circ}{360^\circ}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:J&lt;sub&gt;set&lt;/sub&gt; is the actual Julian date of sunset;
:J&lt;sub&gt;rise&lt;/sub&gt; is the actual Julian date of sunrise.
&lt;!-- 
==Sunrise time : Nepali method==

[[Sunrise]] at the morning is based on [[longitude]] and [[latitude]] of the place and [[standard time]] of the place. Finding the sun-rise (and sun-set) time we need three parameters; viz. [[latitude]], [[longitude]], date on which sun-rise is to be computed. Let take an example of [[Kathmandu]] (27° 42′ 0″ N, 85° 20′ 0″ E) for September 5.

Step 1. Find date difference since March 21 (September 4- March 21=167); then assume A=167*0.985626=164.60°.

Step 2. Find B, where B= Sin-1(0.398749 * Sin 164.60)= 6.07846 (this is in degree, where the sun is over in north, 6.07846° north from equator).

Step 3.	Find C in minutes, where C=4*Sin-1(TanB*TanL)	=4*Sin-1(Tan 6.07846o*Tan 27° 42′ 0″) = 4*3.20496 = 12.81 = 13 minutes
Sunrise in all places of earth having 27° 42′ 0″ N is 13 minute earlier (because of +ve 13) than 6:00 i.e. 5:47 at [[local time]].

  Sunset for that time shall be 12- sunrise time (outcome shall be in time)
  Day-length for that time shall be 2* sunset time (outcome shall be in hours)
Step 4. Find the time difference with standard time (or [[Greenwich Mean Time|Greenwich Time]]) to the [[local time]]. That shall be the sun-rise (watch) time.

For September 5, [[Kathmandu]](85° 20′ 0″ E, 27° 42′ 0″ N) Sun-rise at 5 hour 41 minutes (23:54 Monday).
Time difference of [[Greenwich]] and [[Nepal]] standard time is 5 hours 45 minutes. Standard time Nepal and local time of Kathmandu is 4 minutes slow (west).

Something is confusing here. The top of this nice post began w/ the notion that the algorithm described would lead to, as a final result, Time of Sunrise and Time of Sunset. However, the variables displayed (Jrise &amp; Jset) lead the reader to interpret the output to be Julian days (or dates), not a time of day !! TSR or TSS is not a day, it's TIME of day !!!!!!! This article needs some clarification, especially at the end (Jrise &amp; Jset). We need an algorithm that predicts TSR &amp; TSS as a function of location on the globe and date.

'''Torque''', '''moment''', or '''moment of force''' is rotational [[force]].&lt;ref&gt;Serway, R. A. and Jewett, Jr. J.W. (2003). ''Physics for Scientists and Engineers''. 6th Ed. Brooks Cole. {{ISBN|0-534-40842-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as a linear force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object. In three dimensions, the torque is a [[pseudovector]]; for point particles, it is given by the [[cross product]] of the position vector ([[Euclidean vector|distance vector]]) and the force vector.

The symbol for torque is typically &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the lowercase [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] ''[[tau]]''. When it is called moment of force, it is commonly denoted by ''M''.

The magnitude of torque of a rigid body depends on three quantities: the force applied, the ''lever arm vector''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tipler, Paul|title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Mechanics, Oscillations and Waves, Thermodynamics (5th ed.)|publisher=W. H. Freeman|year=2004|isbn=0-7167-0809-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting the origin to the point of force application, and the angle between the force and lever arm vectors. In symbols:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \tau = \mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \|\mathbf{r}\|\,\|\mathbf{F}\|\sin \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the torque vector and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the torque,
:'''r''' is the position vector (a vector from the origin of the coordinate system defined to the point where the force is applied)
:'''F''' is the force vector,
:× denotes the [[cross product]], which is defined as magnitudes of the respective vectors times &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta &lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt; \theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the force vector and the lever arm vector.

The [[SI units|SI unit]] for torque is N⋅m. For more on the units of torque, see [[Torque#Units|Units]].

== Defining terminology ==
{{See also|Couple (mechanics)}}

Torque is referred to using different vocabulary depending on geographical location and field of study. This article refers to the definition used in US physics in its usage of the word ''torque''.&lt;ref name=Hendricks&gt;''Physics for Engineering'' by Hendricks, Subramony, and Van Blerk, Chinappi page 148, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Kp-UwV4o0gC&amp;pg=PA148 Web link]&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK and in US [[mechanical engineering]], torque is referred to as ''moment of force'', usually shortened to ''moment''.&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; In US physics&lt;ref name=Hendricks /&gt; and UK physics terminology these terms are interchangeable, unlike in US mechanical engineering, where the term ''torque'' is used for the closely related "resultant moment of a [[couple (mechanics)|couple]]".&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt;

''Torque'' is defined mathematically as the rate of change of [[angular momentum]] of an object. The definition of torque states that one or both of the [[angular velocity]] or the [[moment of inertia]] of an object are changing. ''Moment'' is the general term used for the tendency of one or more applied [[force]]s to rotate an object about an axis, but not necessarily to change the angular momentum of the object (the concept which is called ''torque'' in physics).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;Kane, T.R. Kane and D.A. Levinson (1985). ''Dynamics, Theory and Applications'' pp. 90–99: [http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/handle/1813/638 Free download]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a rotational force applied to a shaft causing acceleration, such as a drill bit accelerating from rest, results in a moment called a ''torque''. By contrast, a lateral force on a beam produces a moment (called a [[bending moment]]), but since the angular momentum of the beam is not changing, this bending moment is not called a ''torque''. Similarly with any force couple on an object that has no change to its angular momentum, such moment is also not called a ''torque''.

This article follows the US physics terminology by calling all moments by the term ''torque'', whether or not they cause the angular momentum of an object to change.

== History ==
The concept of torque, also called [[moment (physics)|moment]] or [[couple (mechanics)|couple]], originated with the studies of [[Archimedes]] on [[lever]]s. The term ''torque'' was apparently introduced into English scientific literature by [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], the brother of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Definition and relation to angular momentum==
[[File:Torque, position, and force.svg|thumb|right|A particle is located at position '''r''' relative to its axis of rotation. When a force '''F''' is applied to the particle, only the perpendicular component '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt; produces a torque.

A force applied at a right angle to a lever multiplied by its distance from the [[Lever|lever's fulcrum]] (the length of the [[lever arm]]) is its torque. A force of three [[newton (unit)|newtons]] applied two [[metre]]s from the fulcrum, for example, exerts the same torque as a force of one newton applied six metres from the fulcrum. The direction of the torque can be determined by using the [[right hand grip rule]]: if the fingers of the right hand are curled from the direction of the lever arm to the direction of the force, then the thumb points in the direction of the torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tord.html|title=Right Hand Rule for Torque|accessdate=2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the torque on a particle (which has the position '''r''' in some reference frame) can be defined as the [[cross product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''r''' is the particle's [[position vector]] relative to the fulcrum, and '''F''' is the force acting on the particle. The magnitude ''τ'' of the torque is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = rF\sin\theta,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the distance from the axis of rotation to the particle, ''F'' is the magnitude of the force applied, and ''θ'' is the angle between the position and force vectors. Alternatively,
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = rF_{\perp},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt; is the amount of force directed perpendicularly to the position of the particle. Any force directed parallel to the particle's position vector does not produce a torque.&lt;ref name="halliday_184-85"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halliday|first1=David|last2=Resnick|first2=Robert|title=Fundamentals of Physics|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=1970|pages=184–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922464227|title=College Physics: A Strategic Approach|last=Knight|first=Randall|last2=Jones|first2=Brian|last3=Field|first3=Stuart|publisher=Pearson|others=Jones, Brian, 1960-, Field, Stuart, 1958-|year=2016|isbn=9780134143323|edition=Third edition, technology update|location=Boston|pages=199|oclc=922464227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It follows from the properties of the cross product that the ''torque vector'' is perpendicular to both the ''position'' and ''force'' vectors. The ''torque vector'' points along the axis of the rotation that the ''force vector'' (starting from rest) would initiate. The resulting ''torque vector'' direction is determined by the right-hand rule.&lt;ref name="halliday_184-85" /&gt;

The unbalanced torque on a body along axis of rotation determines the rate of change of the body's [[angular momentum]],
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''L''' is the angular momentum vector and ''t'' is time. If multiple torques are acting on the body, it is instead the net torque which determines the rate of change of the angular momentum:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_1 + \cdots + \boldsymbol{\tau}_n = \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathrm{net}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;

For the motion of a point particle,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = I\boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''I''}} is the [[moment of inertia]] and '''ω''' is the [[angular velocity]]. It follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathrm{net}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}(I\boldsymbol{\omega})}{\mathrm{d}t} = I\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\omega}}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{\mathrm{d}I}{\mathrm{d}t}\boldsymbol{\omega} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha} + \frac{\mathrm{d}(mr^2)}{\mathrm{d}t}\boldsymbol{\omega} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha} + 2rp_{||}\boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''α''' is the [[angular acceleration]] of the particle, and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;||&lt;/sub&gt; is the radial component of its [[linear momentum]]. This equation is the rotational analogue of [[Newton's Second Law]] for point particles, and is valid for any type of trajectory. Note that although force and acceleration are always parallel and directly proportional, the torque '''τ''' need not be parallel or directly proportional to the angular acceleration '''α'''. This arises from the fact that although mass is always conserved, the moment of inertia in general is not.

=== Proof of the equivalence of definitions ===
The definition of angular momentum for a single particle is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \boldsymbol{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where "×" indicates the vector [[cross product]], '''p''' is the particle's [[linear momentum]], and '''r''' is the [[displacement vector]] from the origin (the origin is assumed to be a fixed location anywhere in space). The time-derivative of this is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{r} \times \frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} \times \boldsymbol{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

This result can easily be proven by splitting the vectors into components and applying the [[product rule]]. Now using the definition of force &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt; (whether or not mass is constant) and the definition of velocity &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F} + \mathbf{v} \times \boldsymbol{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

The cross product of momentum &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{p}&lt;/math&gt; with its associated velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is zero because velocity and momentum are parallel, so the second term vanishes.

By definition, torque '''τ''' = '''r''' × '''F'''. Therefore, torque on a particle is ''equal'' to the
[[Derivative#Notation for differentiation|first derivative]] of its angular momentum with respect to time.

If multiple forces are applied, Newton's second law instead reads {{nowrap|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m'''''a'''}}, and it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{net}} =  \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathrm{net}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a general proof.

== Units ==
Torque has [[dimension (physics)|dimension]] force times [[distance]], symbolically {{dimanalysis|length=2|mass=1|time=−2}}. Official [[SI]] literature suggests using the unit ''[[newton metre]]'' (N⋅m) or the unit ''[[joule]] per [[radian]]''.&lt;ref name=BIPM222&gt;From the [http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/section2-2-2.html official SI website]: "...For example, the quantity torque may be thought of as the cross product of force and distance, suggesting the unit newton metre, or it may be thought of as energy per angle, suggesting the unit joule per radian."&lt;/ref&gt; The unit ''newton metre'' is properly denoted N⋅m or N&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name="BIPM 5.1"&gt;{{cite web |title=SI brochure Ed. 8, Section 5.1 |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |year=2014 |url=https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/section5-1.html |accessdate=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This avoids ambiguity with mN, millinewtons.

The SI unit for [[energy]] or [[mechanical work|work]] is the [[joule]]. It is dimensionally equivalent to a force of one newton acting over a distance of one metre, but it is not used for torque. Energy and torque are entirely different concepts, so the practice of using different unit names (i.e., reserving newton metres for torque and using only [[joules]] for energy) helps avoid mistakes and misunderstandings.&lt;ref name=BIPM222 /&gt; The dimensional equivalence of these units is not simply a coincidence: a torque of 1&amp;nbsp;N⋅m applied through a full revolution will require an [[energy]] of exactly 2π joules. Mathematically,

:&lt;math&gt;E= \tau \theta\ &lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the energy, ''τ'' is magnitude of the torque, and ''θ'' is the angle moved (in [[radian]]s). This equation motivates the alternate unit name ''joules per radian''.&lt;ref name=BIPM222 /&gt;

In Imperial units, "[[Pound-foot (torque)|pound-force-feet]]" (lbf⋅ft), "foot-pounds-force", "inch-pounds-force", "ounce-force-[[inch]]es" (ozf⋅in) {{citation needed|date=December 2016}} are used, and other non-SI units of torque includes "metre-[[kilogram-force|kilograms-force]]". For all these units, the word "force" is often left out.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite web|title=CNC Cookbook: Dictionary: N-Code to PWM|url=http://www.cnccookbook.com/MTCNCDictNtoPWM.htm|accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, abbreviating "pound-force-foot" to simply "pound-foot" (in this case, it would be implicit that the "pound" is [[pound-force]] and not [[pound-mass]]). This is an example of the confusion caused by the use of English units that may be avoided with SI units because of the careful distinction in SI between force (in newtons) and mass (in kilograms).

Torque is sometimes listed with units that do not make dimensional sense, such as the gram-centimeter. In this case, "gram" should be understood as the force given by the weight of 1 gram on the surface of the Earth (i.e. 0.00980665&amp;nbsp;N). The surface of the Earth has a standard [[Gravity of Earth|gravitational]] field strength of 9.80665&amp;nbsp;N/kg.

== Special cases and other facts ==

=== Moment arm formula ===
[[File:moment arm.svg|thumb|right|Moment arm diagram]]
A very useful special case, often given as the definition of torque in fields other than physics, is as follows:
&lt;!--:''τ'' = moment arm × force--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = (\text{moment arm}) (\text{force}).&lt;/math&gt;

The construction of the "moment arm" is shown in the figure to the right, along with the vectors '''r''' and '''F''' mentioned above. The problem with this definition is that it does not give the direction of the torque but only the magnitude, and hence it is difficult to use in three-dimensional cases. If the force is perpendicular to the displacement vector '''r''', the moment arm will be equal to the distance to the centre, and torque will be a maximum for the given force. The equation for the magnitude of a torque, arising from a perpendicular force:

&lt;!--:''τ'' = distance to centre × Applied force--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = (\text{distance to centre}) (\text{force}).&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if a person places a force of 10&amp;nbsp;N at the terminal end of a wrench that is 0.5&amp;nbsp;m long (or a force of 10&amp;nbsp;N exactly 0.5&amp;nbsp;m from the twist point of a wrench of any length), the torque will be 5&amp;nbsp;N&amp;sdot;m – assuming that the person moves the wrench by applying force in the plane of movement and perpendicular to the wrench.

[[File:PrecessionOfATop.svg|thumb|right|The torque caused by the two opposing forces '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and −'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; causes a change in the angular momentum '''L''' in the direction of that torque. This causes the top to [[precess]].]]

=== Static equilibrium ===
For an object to be in [[static equilibrium]], not only must the sum of the forces be zero, but also the sum of the torques (moments) about any point. For a two-dimensional situation with horizontal and vertical forces, the sum of the forces requirement is two equations: Σ''H'' = 0 and Σ''V'' = 0, and the torque a third equation: Σ''τ'' = 0. That is, to solve [[statically determinate]] equilibrium problems in two-dimensions, three equations are used.

=== Net force versus torque ===
When the net force on the system is zero, the torque measured from any point in space is the same. For example, the torque on a current-carrying loop in a uniform magnetic field is the same regardless of your point of reference. If the net force &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is not zero, and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_1&lt;/math&gt; is the torque measured from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1&lt;/math&gt;, then the torque measured from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_2&lt;/math&gt; is …
&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_2 = \boldsymbol{\tau}_1 + (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;

== Machine torque ==
[[File:Torque Curve.svg|thumb|Torque curve of a motorcycle ("BMW K 1200 R 2005"). The horizontal axis is the speed (in [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]) that the [[crankshaft]] is turning, and the vertical axis is the torque (in [[newton metre]]s) that the engine is capable of providing at that speed.]]
Torque is part of the basic specification of an [[engine]]: the [[power (physics)|power]] output of an engine is expressed as its torque multiplied by its rotational speed of the axis. [[internal combustion|Internal-combustion]] engines produce useful torque only over a limited range of rotational speeds (typically from around 1,000–6,000 rpm for a small car). The varying torque output over that range can be  measured with a [[dynamometer]], and shown as a torque curve.

[[Steam engine]]s and [[electric motor]]s tend to produce maximum torque close to zero rpm, with the torque diminishing as rotational speed rises (due to increasing friction and other constraints). Reciprocating steam engines and electric motors can start heavy loads from zero RPM without a [[clutch]].

== Relationship between torque, power, and energy ==
If a [[force]] is allowed to act through a distance, it is doing [[mechanical work]]. Similarly, if torque is allowed to act through a rotational distance, it is doing work. Mathematically, for rotation about a fixed axis through the [[center of mass]],
:&lt;math&gt; W = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \tau\ \mathrm{d}\theta,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''W'' is work, ''τ'' is torque, and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represent (respectively) the initial and final [[angular position]]s of the body.&lt;ref name="kleppner_267-68"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleppner|first1=Daniel|last2=Kolenkow|first2= Robert|title=An Introduction to Mechanics|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1973|pages=267–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proof===
The work done by a variable force acting over a finite linear displacement &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is given by integrating the force with respect to an elemental linear displacement &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\vec{s}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_{s_1}^{s_2} \vec{F}\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{s}&lt;/math&gt;

However, the infinitesimal linear displacement &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\vec{s}&lt;/math&gt; is related to a corresponding angular displacement &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\vec{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; and the radius vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; as 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\vec{s} = \mathrm{d}\vec{\theta}\times\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution in the above expression for work gives
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_{s_1}^{s_2} \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{\theta} \times \vec{r}&lt;/math&gt;

The expression &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{\theta}\times\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[scalar triple product]] given by &lt;math&gt;\left[\vec{F}\,\mathrm{d}\vec{\theta}\,\vec{r}\right]&lt;/math&gt;. An alternate expression for the same scalar triple product is
:&lt;math&gt;\left[\vec{F}\,\mathrm{d}\vec{\theta}\,\vec{r}\right] = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

But as per the definition of torque,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\tau} = \vec{r}\times\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt;

Corresponding substitution in the expression of work gives,
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_{s_1}^{s_2} \vec{\tau} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the parameter of integration has been changed from linear displacement to angular displacement, the limits of the integration also change correspondingly, giving
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_{\theta _1}^{\theta _2} \vec{\tau}\cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

If the torque and the angular displacement are in the same direction, then the scalar product reduces to a product of magnitudes; i.e., &lt;math&gt;\vec{\tau}\cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{\theta} = \left|\vec{\tau}\right|\left| \, \mathrm{d}\vec{\theta}\right|\cos 0 = \tau \, \mathrm{d}\theta&lt;/math&gt; giving

:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_{\theta _1}^{\theta _2} \tau \, \mathrm{d}\theta&lt;/math&gt;

It follows from the [[work-energy theorem]] that ''W'' also represents the change in the [[Rotational energy|rotational kinetic energy]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; of the body, given by

:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{r}} = \tfrac{1}{2}I\omega^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I'' is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body and ''ω'' is its [[angular speed]].&lt;ref name="kleppner_267-68" /&gt;

[[Power (physics)|Power]] is the work per unit [[time]], given by
:&lt;math&gt;P = \boldsymbol{\tau} \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P'' is power, ''τ'' is torque, ''ω'' is the [[angular velocity]], and &amp;sdot; represents the [[scalar product]].

Algebraically, the equation may be rearranged to compute torque for a given angular speed and power output. Note that the power injected by the torque depends only on the instantaneous angular speed – not on whether the angular speed increases, decreases, or remains constant while the torque is being applied (this is equivalent to the linear case where the power injected by a force depends only on the instantaneous speed – not on the resulting acceleration, if any).

In practice, this relationship can be observed in [[bicycle]]s: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as [[sprockets]]) meshing with a circular [[bicycle chain|chain]], and a [[derailleur gears|derailleur mechanism]] if the bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. [[Single-speed bicycle#Advantages and disadvantages versus multi-speed bicycles|multi-speed bicycle]]), all of which attached to the [[bicycle frame|frame]]. A [[cyclist]], the person who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby [[Crank (mechanism)|cranking]] the front sprocket (commonly referred to as [[Crankset#Chainring|chainring]]). The input power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of [[cadence (cycling)|cadence]] (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the torque on [[Axle|spindle]] of the bicycle's [[crankset]]. The bicycle's [[bicycle drivetrain systems|drivetrain]] transmits the input power to the road [[wheel]], which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the [[gear ratio]] of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)&lt;sub&gt;input&lt;/sub&gt; pair is converted to a (torque, rpm)&lt;sub&gt;output&lt;/sub&gt; pair. By using a larger rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in multi-speed bicycles, [[angular frequency|angular speed]] of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.

Consistent units must be used. For metric SI units, power is [[watt]]s, torque is [[newton metre]]s and angular speed is [[radian]]s per second (not rpm and not revolutions per second).

Also, the unit newton metre is [[dimensional analysis|dimensionally equivalent]] to the [[joule]], which is the unit of energy. However, in the case of torque, the unit is assigned to a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], whereas for [[energy]], it is assigned to a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]].

=== Conversion to other units ===
A conversion factor may be necessary when using different units of power or torque.  For example, if [[rotational speed]] (revolutions per time) is used in place of angular speed (radians per time), we multiply by a factor of 2{{pi}} radians per revolution. In the following formulas, ''P'' is power, ''τ'' is torque, and ''ν'' ([[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]]) is rotational speed.
:&lt;math&gt;P = \tau \cdot 2 \pi \cdot \nu&lt;/math&gt;

Showing units:
:&lt;math&gt; P ({\rm W}) = \tau {\rm (N \cdot m)} \cdot 2 \pi {\rm (rad/rev)} \cdot \nu {\rm (rev/sec)} &lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by 60 seconds per minute gives us the following.
:&lt;math&gt; P ({\rm W}) = \frac{ \tau {\rm (N \cdot m)} \cdot 2 \pi {\rm (rad/rev)} \cdot \nu {\rm (rpm)} } {60} &lt;/math&gt;

where rotational speed is in revolutions per minute (rpm).

Some people (e.g., American automotive engineers) use [[horsepower]] (imperial mechanical) for power, foot-pounds (lbf⋅ft) for torque and rpm for rotational speed. This results in the formula changing to:
:&lt;math&gt; P ({\rm hp}) = \frac{ \tau {\rm (lbf \cdot ft)} \cdot 2 \pi {\rm (rad/rev)} \cdot \nu ({\rm rpm})} {33,000}. &lt;/math&gt;

The constant below (in foot pounds per minute) changes with the definition of the horsepower; for example, using metric horsepower, it becomes approximately 32,550.

Use of other units (e.g., [[BTU]] per hour for power) would require a different custom conversion factor.

=== Derivation ===

For a rotating object, the ''linear distance'' covered at the [[circumference]] of rotation is the product of the radius with the angle covered.  That is:  linear distance = radius × angular distance.   And by definition, linear distance = linear speed × time = radius × angular speed × time.

By the definition of torque: torque = radius × force. We can rearrange this to determine force = torque ÷ radius. These two values can be substituted into the definition of [[Power (physics)|power]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\text{power} &amp; = \frac{\text{force} \cdot \text{linear distance}}{\text{time}} \\[6pt]
&amp; = \frac{\left(\dfrac{\text{torque}} r \right) \cdot (r \cdot \text{angular speed} \cdot t)} t \\[6pt]
&amp; = \text{torque} \cdot \text{angular speed}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The radius ''r'' and time ''t'' have dropped out of the equation.  However, angular speed must be in radians, by the assumed direct relationship between linear speed and angular speed at the beginning of the derivation.  If the rotational speed is measured in revolutions per unit of time, the linear speed and distance are increased proportionately by 2{{pi}} in the above derivation to give:

: &lt;math&gt;\text{power} = \text{torque} \cdot 2 \pi \cdot \text{rotational speed}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

If torque is in newton metres and rotational speed in revolutions per second, the above equation gives power in newton metres per second or watts.  If Imperial units are used, and if torque is in pounds-force feet and rotational speed in revolutions per minute, the above equation gives power in foot pounds-force per minute.  The horsepower form of the equation is then derived by applying the conversion factor 33,000&amp;nbsp;ft⋅lbf/min per horsepower:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\text{power} &amp; = \text{torque} \cdot 2 \pi \cdot \text{rotational speed} \cdot \frac{\text{ft}\cdot\text{lbf}}{\text{min}} \cdot \frac{\text{horsepower}}{33,000 \cdot \frac{\text{ft}\cdot\text{lbf}}{\text{min}}} \\[6pt]
&amp; \approx \frac {\text{torque} \cdot \text{RPM}}{5,252}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

because &lt;math&gt;5252.113122 \approx \frac {33,000} {2 \pi}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

== Principle of moments ==
The Principle of Moments, also known as Varignon's theorem (not to be confused with the [[Varignon's theorem|geometrical theorem]] of the same name) states that the sum of torques due to several forces applied to ''a single'' point is equal to the torque due to the sum (resultant) of the forces. Mathematically, this follows from:
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F}_1) + (\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F}_2) + \cdots = \mathbf{r}\times(\mathbf{F}_1+\mathbf{F}_2 + \cdots). &lt;/math&gt;

== Torque multiplier ==
{{Main|Torque multiplier}}
Torque can be multiplied via three methods:  by locating the fulcrum such that the length of a lever is increased; by using a longer lever; or by the use of a speed reducing gearset or [[gear box]].  Such a mechanism multiplies torque, as rotation rate is reduced.

'''USS ''Sargo'' (SSN-583)''', a [[Skate class submarine|''Skate''-class]] [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[submarine]], was the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for the [[sargo]], a food and game fish of the [[Sea bream|porgy]] family, inhabiting coastal waters of the southern United States.

The contract to build her was awarded to [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] in [[Vallejo, California]], on 29 September 1955 and her keel was laid down on 21 February 1956. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 10 October 1957, sponsored by the wife of Rear Admiral [[Frank T. Watkins]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 1 October 1958 with [[Commander Daniel P. Brooks]] in command.

==Operational history==
{{expand section|information on her service from 1969 to 1988|date=March 2010}}
Prior to completion, ''Sargo'' was designated for an Arctic cruise. She received alterations to strengthen her sail before she left the building yard. Further modifications followed her 19,000-mile (35,200&amp;nbsp;km) Pacific shakedown cruise. After her arrival at her home port, [[Pearl Harbor]], on 1 October 1959, scientific instruments were installed to assist her in navigating under the shifting polar ice with its potentially hazardous submerged pressure ridges; in locating open leads and thin ice through which to surface, and in gathering oceanographic and hydrographic data.  November and December 1959 brought intensive training programs and the embarkation of scientific specialists; and, on 18 January 1960, ''Sargo'', under the command of Lieutenant Commander J.H. Nicholson, cleared Pearl Harbor and headed north to make a submerged exploration of the Arctic Ocean.

By 25 January, ''Sargo'' had reached the vicinity of St. Matthews Island where she found ice, block and brash and where, after rendezvousing with the [[United States Navy]] [[icebreaker]] [[USS Staten Island (AGB-5)|''USS Staten Island'' (AGB-5)]] she made her first stationary dive while surrounded by ice. On 29 January, she passed the [[Diomede Islands]] and crossed the [[Arctic Circle]]; and, on 9 February, she arrived under the [[North Pole]].

Making her first pass under the pole at 0934, the submarine began a clover-leaf search for thin ice and at 1049 she surfaced, according to her log, 25 feet (8 m) from the pole. Later the same day, the [[Hawaiian flag]] was raised at the pole, and, on the morning of 10 February, ''Sargo'' submerged and set a course for the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] and a rendezvous with ice island [[Iceberg|T-3]].

Collecting hydrographic data as she progressed, she reached [[Iceberg|T-3]] on 17 February. Thence, after conducting tests in cooperation with scientists on the ice island, she got underway for the [[Bering Strait]], the [[Aleutian Islands]], and Hawaii.  On 3 March 1960, ''Sargo'', having covered over 11,000 miles (20,000&amp;nbsp;km), 6,003 miles (11,118&amp;nbsp;km) under ice, returned to [[Pearl Harbor]] with new data on Arctic ice, Arctic waters, and the physiography of the [[Arctic Basin]]. The latter included information on [[Alpha Ridge]] and on the presence of deep water areas at the western end of the northwest passage.  For this cruise the ''Sargo'' earned the [[Navy Unit Commendation]], the second highest award possible for a ship of the United States Navy.

Repairs took ''Sargo'' into April. At the end of that month, she resumed operations in the Hawaiian area with a demonstration cruise for the [[King of Nepal]].

On 14 June, the submarine was docked in [[Pearl Harbor]], preparing to take [[Rama IX of Thailand|Bhumibol Adulyadej]] and his wife [[Sirikit|Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara]], the [[King of Thailand|King and Queen of Thailand]] on a cruise the next day.  ''Sargo'' was charging her [[oxygen]] tanks when the oxygen line, which entered the submarine through the stern torpedo room hatch, developed a leak and a fire ignited. Two [[Mark 37 torpedo]] warheads detonated "low-order", and the fire spread dramatically, killing the crewman tending the [[oxygen]] line, machinist's mate third class James E. Smallwood. The fire, fed by the pressurized oxygen, shot flames over 100 feet (30 m) in the air through the hatch.  When the combined forces of the shipyard and the boat's crew were unable to control the fire, ''Sargo'''s officers took the submarine a short distance from the dock and dove with the stern room hatch open.  The fire was extinguished, and ''Sargo'' bottomed in the channel.  A floating crane raised the ''Sargo'', and repairs took three months in drydock.

[[James E. Smallwood]] MM3(SS), lost his life in the fire while taking action to save the ship. He was awarded, posthumously, the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his heroic actions and other crew members were also awarded medals and letters of commendation for outstanding courage over and above the call of duty. On 15 April 1987, Submarine Base Pearl Harbor opened a new 17-story Bachelor Enlisted Quarters, which was dedicated on 26 February 1988 in the memory of Smallwood and the sacrifice of his life while performing in the service of his country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssn583.com/History/Smallwood.htm USS Sargo (SSN-583) website's page displaying Smallwood's citation, including links to articles about Smallwood Hall. Retrieved 20 November 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

From October through December 1960, ''Sargo'' again conducted type training exercises.

In 1961 ''Sargo'' assumed a more regular schedule. On 19 January, she sailed for the [[Philippines]] on her first deployment with the [[US 7th Fleet|Seventh Fleet]]. In the western Pacific into May, she participated in exercises to enhance the antisubmarine warfare readiness of hunter-killer groups and visited Sydney, for the 19th Annual Coral Sea Celebration. On 25 May, she returned to Pearl Harbor.  Upkeep and local operations took her into late July, when she began a two-month training cruise. In November, she moved east, to California, to participate in a demonstration for the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] and foreign attaches. She then returned to Pearl Harbor for holiday leave and upkeep.  During the late winter and early spring of 1962, ''Sargo'' made another extended cruise in the western Pacific, again earning a [[Navy Unit Commendation]] for her effort.

Local operations and upkeep followed her return to [[Pearl Harbor]]; and, in July, she entered the naval shipyard there for an [[Refueling and Overhaul|overhaul]] which lasted through the winter of 1962 and 1963. During the work, she became the first nuclear ship to be [[Refueling and Overhaul|refueled]] at that shipyard. In mid-summer 1963, she commenced an extended cruise to the western Pacific, and, in October she returned to Hawaii for six months of local operations.

From April to October 1964, ''Sargo'' once again deployed to the western Pacific; and, during August, she was called on to support operations resulting from the [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident]]. After her return to Hawaii, local operations and upkeep took her into the next year. In April 1965, she commenced another cruise in the western Pacific, and, in June, she resumed operations in the eastern Pacific. Five months later, she again moved westward across the Pacific; and, in February 1966, she returned to Hawaii to enter the naval shipyard at Pearl Harbor where she remained for the next two years, undergoing overhaul and refueling.  Between 1963 and 1965 ''Sargo'' earned three more [[Navy Unit Commendation]]s.

On 5 April 1968, ''Sargo'' left the shipyard. She had been overhauled and her third reactor core had been installed.  Refresher training followed and, in June she resumed her previous schedule with an extended cruise in the western Pacific. Since that time, into 1974, she has maintained a schedule of eastern and western Pacific cruises and training operations, including joint British, Australian, and American exercises in the [[South China Sea]] in January 1969.

==Decommissioning==
Decommissioned and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 21 April 1988, ex-''Sargo'' entered the Navy's Nuclear-Powered [[Ship and Submarine Recycling Program]] on 14 April 1994; recycling was completed on 5 April 1995.

==History==
In 2003, [[IBM]] and other research participants sponsored the ''Smallpox Research Grid Project'' to accelerate the discovery of a cure for [[smallpox]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2003/02/06/192324/IBM-builds-grid-for-smallpox-research.htm "IBM builds grid for smallpox research"]. ComputerWeekly.com. 2003-02-06. Retrieved 2014-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The smallpox study used a massive distributed computing grid to analyze compounds' effectiveness against smallpox.&lt;ref name="Smallpox"&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=24 November 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project allowed scientists to screen 35 million potential drug molecules against several smallpox proteins to identify good candidates for developing into smallpox treatments. In the first 72 hours, 100,000 results were returned. By the end of the project, 44 strong treatment candidates had been identified.&lt;ref name="Smallpox results"&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the success of the Smallpox study, IBM announced on the creation of World Community Grid on November 16, 2004, with the goal of creating a technical environment where other humanitarian research could be processed.&lt;ref name="WCG introduced"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smallpox"/&gt;

World Community Grid initially only supported Windows, using the proprietary [[Grid MP]] software from [[United Devices]] which powered the [[grid.org]] distributed computing projects. Demand for Linux support led to the addition in November 2005 of open source Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing ([[BOINC]]) grid technology which powers projects such as [[Seti@home|SETI@home]] and [[Climateprediction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Scale of the project===
As of October 2014, World Community Grid had over 65,000 active user accounts, with over 249,000 active devices.&lt;ref name="BOINCstats"/&gt; Over the course of the project, more than 1,000,000 cumulative years of computing time have been donated, and over 2 billion workunits have been completed.&lt;ref name="Global Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/stat/viewGlobal.do|title=Global Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=World Community Grid|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many public computing grids such as [[SETI@home]] and [[Folding@home]] are devoted to a single project, World Community Grid offers multiple humanitarian projects under a single umbrella.
Users are included in a subset of projects by default, but may opt out of projects as they choose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

When World Community Grid launched, they used the proprietary [[Grid MP]] client from [[United Devices]]. After adding support for the [[open source]] [[BOINC]] client in 2005, World Community Grid eventually discontinued the Grid MP client and consolidated on the BOINC platform in 2008.&lt;ref name="bbover3"&gt;{{cite web

Even though WCG makes use of open source client software, the actual applications that perform the scientific calculations may not be. However, several of the science applications are available under a free license, although the source is not available directly from WCG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Potential problems===
[[File:BOINC running-Task mgr CPU usage history demo-en-1.png|right|thumb|250px|The picture shows particular two CPU usage history (under [[Hyper-threading]]) when [[BOINC]] client software is processing two tasks on each CPU under [[Microsoft Windows]] XP SP2.

The rest of half period of history is set to update speed normal, and upper CPU usage history indicates slightly more than 60% and lower CPU usage history show 35% approx. in average.]]
The World Community Grid software increases [[CPU]] usage by consuming unused processing time; in the late 1990s and early 2000s, such calculations were meant to reduce "wasted" CPU cycles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sharewarejunkies.com/9zwd11/setihome.htm&lt;/ref&gt; With modern CPUs, where [[dynamic frequency scaling]] is prevalent, increased usage makes the processor run at higher frequency,&lt;ref&gt;Although on [[GNU/Linux]] systems the [https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cpu-freq/governors.txt CPUfreq frequency scaling governor can be configured otherwise] with the parameter ignore_nice_load.&lt;/ref&gt; increasing power usage and heating counter to [[power management]]. Additionally, because of an increasing focus on power performance,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cpubenchmark.net/power_performance.html&lt;/ref&gt; or [[performance per watt]], connecting old/inefficient computers to the grid will increase the total/average power required to complete the same calculations.

The [[BOINC]] client avoids slowing the computer by using a variety of limits that suspend computation when there are insufficient free resources. Unlike other BOINC projects, World Community Grid set the BOINC defaults conservatively, making the chances of computer damage extremely small. The default CPU throttle is 60%. The throttle is coarse-grained; for example, if usage is set to 60% it will work at 100% for 3 seconds, then at 0% for 2 seconds, resulting in an average decrease of processor use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An add-on program for Windows computers – [http://efmer.eu/boinc/ TThrottle] – can solve the problem of overheating by directly limiting the BOINC project's use of the host computer. It does this by measuring the CPU and/or the GPU temperature and adjusts the run time accordingly. It also uses a shorter switching time of less than one second, resulting in less temperature change during switching.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Statistics and competition==
The contributions of each user are recorded and user contribution statistics are publicly available.&lt;ref name="Global Statistics"/&gt; Due to the fact that the processing time of each workunit varies from computer to computer, depending on the difficulty of the workunit, the speed of the computer, and the amount of idle resources available, contributions are usually measured in terms of ''points''. Points are awarded for each workunit depending on the effort required to process it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/help/viewTopic.do?shortName=points#27
|title=Points: What are points?
|work=Help
|publisher=World Community Grid
|accessdate=2007-07-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completing a workunit, the [[BOINC]] client will request the number of points it thinks it deserves based on software [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]s (''see [[BOINC Credit System#Cobblestones]]''). Since multiple computers process the same workunit to ensure accuracy, the World Community Grid servers can look at the points claimed by each of those computers. The WCG servers disregard statistical outliers, average the remaining values and award the resulting number of points to each computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Within the grid, users may join teams that have been created by organizations, groups, or individuals. Teams allow for a heightened sense of community identity and can also inspire competition. As teams compete against each other, more work is done for the grid overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Outreach==
World Community Grid recognizes companies and organizations as ''partners'' if they promote WCG within their company or organization. As of March 2018, WCG had 449 partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/about_us/viewOurPartners.do|title=About Us - Our Partners|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=World Community Grid|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, as part of its commitment to improving human health and welfare, the results of all computations completed on World Community Grid are released into the public domain and made available to the scientific community.&lt;ref name="About Us"/&gt;

==Scientific Results==
Since its launch, more than twenty projects have run in the World Community Grid. Some of the results include:

* In February 2014, the '''[[Help Fight Childhood Cancer]]''' project scientists announced the discovery of 7 compounds that destroy [[neuroblastoma]] cancer cells without any apparent side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/about_us/viewNewsArticle.do?articleId=342|title=News Article|work=worldcommunitygrid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery, made with the support of the WCG volunteers, is a positive step towards a new treatment. The project has announced that it is seeking a collaboration with a pharmaceutical company in order to develop the compounds into treatments. Given the success of the project, the scientists have stated that they are already planning a follow-up project which will focus on other [[pediatric cancer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, possibly in collaboration with a newly-formed Pan-Asian oncology group, of which they are a founding member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/about_us/viewNewsArticle.do?articleId=365|title=News Article|work=worldcommunitygrid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''[[GO Fight Against Malaria]]''' project reported the discovery of several molecules that are effective against [[Malaria]] and Drug-Resistant [[Tuberculosis]] (including TDR-TB, for which there is no treatment available). The project also tested for new molecules against [[MRSA]], [[Filariasis]] and [[Bubonic Plague]]. Laboratory testing continues in order to turn those molecules into possible treatments. GFAM was also the first project ever to perform a billion different docking calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/about_us/viewNewsArticle.do?articleId=373|title=News Article|work=worldcommunitygrid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper was published in January 2015&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/about_us/viewNewsArticle.do?articleId=433|title=Post grid calculations continue to yield progress and inspire new methods against deadly diseases|website=www.worldcommunitygrid.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perryman|first=Alexander L.|last2=Yu|first2=Weixuan|last3=Wang|first3=Xin|last4=Ekins|first4=Sean|last5=Forli|first5=Stefano|last6=Li|first6=Shao-Gang|last7=Freundlich|first7=Joel S.|last8=Tonge|first8=Peter J.|last9=Olson|first9=Arthur J.|date=2015-03-23|title=A Virtual Screen Discovers Novel, Fragment-Sized Inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis InhA|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/ci500672v|journal=Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling|volume=55|issue=3|pages=645–659|doi=10.1021/ci500672v|issn=1549-9596|pmc=4386068}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with two more pending submission. In June 2015, the project reported that of the two "hits" discovered against a drug-resistant tuberculosis strain, several "analogs" have been synthesized, the best one of which inhibits the growth of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' and is relatively non-toxic to mammalian cells. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*The '''[[Discovering Dengue Drugs - Together]]''' project scientists reported the discovery of several new Dengue protease inhibitors, most of which also inhibit the [[West Nile Virus]] protease. A handful of these have already entered "crucial pre-clinical pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies". In November 2014, an update reported that the scientists have a drug lead that disables a key enzyme that allows the Dengue virus to replicate. It has also shown the same behaviour in other flaviviruses, such as the West Nile Virus. No negative side effects such as toxicity, carcenogenicity or mutagenicity have been observed, making this drug lead a very strong antiviral drug candidate for these viruses. The scientists are now working to synthesize variants of the molecule to improve its activity and enter planned pre-clinical and clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://secure.worldcommunitygrid.org/about_us/viewNewsArticle.do?articleId=397|title = Decade of Discovery: A new drug lead to combat dengue fever|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In June 2013, the '''[[Clean Energy Project]]''' published a database of over 2.3 million organic molecules which have had their properties characterized. Of these, 35,000 molecules have shown the potential to double the efficiency over organic solar cells currently being produced. Before this initiative, scientists knew of just a handful of carbon-based materials that were able to convert sunlight into electricity efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.worldcommunitygrid.org/about_us/viewNewsArticle.do?articleId=387|title=Decade of discovery: doubling carbon-based solar cell efficiency|last=|first=|date=|work=worldcommunitygrid.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://secure.worldcommunitygrid.org/about_us/viewNewsArticle.do?articleId=307 |publisher=worldcommunitygrid.org |title=Harvard publishes World Community Grid data, rating millions of compounds for use in solar cells |date=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In February 2010, the '''[[FightAIDS@Home]]''' project scientists announced that they have found two compounds which make a potentially new class of AIDS-fighting drugs possible. The compounds attach to the virus at newly-discovered binding sites, and thus can be used to "enhance existing therapies, treat drug-resistant strains of the disease, and slow the evolution of drug resistance in the virus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scripps.edu/newsandviews/e_20100208/hiv.html|title=TSRI - News &amp; Views, Scientists Find Two Compounds that Lay the Foundation for a New Class of AIDS Drug|work=scripps.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.worldcommunitygrid.org/about_us/viewNewsArticle.do?articleId=122|title=News Article|work=worldcommunitygrid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In July 2015, the '''[[Drug Search for Leishmaniasis]]''' project announced it had tested the top 10 compounds with highest predicted efficiency out of over 100 identified via WCG workunits. Of those 10, 4 showed "positive results" in ''in vitro'' testing, with one showing "an exceptionally promising result".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/about_us/viewNewsArticle.do?articleId=435|title=Exceptional early results in the fight against Leishmaniasis|website=www.worldcommunitygrid.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, ''in vivo'' testing of the 4 compounds on hamsters showed favorable results, with one compound inducing "an almost complete curing of the lesions in two out of five hamsters."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/about_us/viewNewsArticle.do?articleId=534|title=Potential New Treatments for Leishmaniasis Tested in Lab|website=www.worldcommunitygrid.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In July 2015, the '''[[Computing for Clean Water]]''' project announced that a paper had been published in the [[Nature Nanotechnology]] journal describing a new type of water filter efficiently utilising nanotubes. "[The] nanotubes are made of single-atom-thick sheets of carbon atoms, called [[graphene]], rolled up into tiny tubes, with diameters of just a few nanometers - one ten-thousandth the diameter of a human hair. The size of the tubes allows water molecules to pass through, but blocks larger pathogens and contaminants, purifying the water." By running simulations on WCG, the scientists discovered that certain kinds of natural vibrations called [[Phonon|phonons]], under specific conditions, can lead to more than 300% increased flow of water through the nanotubes, compared to previous theoretical predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://secure.worldcommunitygrid.org/about_us/viewNewsArticle.do?articleId=436|title=Enhancing the potential for nanotechnology to improve access to clean water for millions|website=secure.worldcommunitygrid.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In April 2015, the '''[[Say No To Schistosoma project]]''' scientists reported that subsequent analysis had been performed, and the three most promising candidate substances had been identified for ''in vitro'' testing.&lt;ref name="secure.worldcommunitygrid.org"&gt;{{citation |url=https://secure.worldcommunitygrid.org/about_us/viewNewsArticle.do?articleId=427 |title=Turning virtual results into real-world treatments for schistosoma |accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mapping Cancer Markers===
'''Mapping Cancer Markers''' (launched November 8, 2013). The project aims to identify the markers associated with various types of cancer, and is analyzing millions of data points collected from thousands of healthy and cancerous patient tissue samples. These include tissues with lung, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic and breast cancers. By comparing these different data points, researchers aim to identify patterns of markers for different cancers and correlate them with different outcomes, including responsiveness to various treatment options. The project is focusing on 4 types of cancer, with the first focus being on lung cancer, and will move on to ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and sarcoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.worldcommunitygrid.org/research/mcm1/overview.do|title=World Community Grid - Research - Mapping Cancer Markers|work=worldcommunitygrid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.worldcommunitygrid.org/forums/wcg/viewthread_thread,36146_offset,0#445500|title=World Community Grid - View Thread - MCM1 Update|work=worldcommunitygrid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human Proteome Folding – Phase 2===
{{Main article|Human Proteome Folding Project}}
'''Human Proteome Folding - Phase 2 (HPF2)''' (launched June 23, 2006&lt;ref name="Active Research" /&gt;) was the third project to run on World Community Grid, and completed in 2013. This project, following on from HPF1, focused on human-secreted [[proteins]], with special focus on [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarkers]] and the proteins on the surface of cells as well as [[Plasmodium]], the organism that causes malaria. HPF2 generates higher-resolution protein models than HPF1. Though these higher-resolution models are more useful, they also require more processing power to generate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
