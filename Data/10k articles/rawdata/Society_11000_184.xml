      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18322">'''1937 peasant strike in Poland''', also known in some Polish sources as the '''Great Peasant Uprising''' ({{lang-pl|Wielki Strajk Chłopski}}) was a mass [[strike action|strike]] and [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] of peasants organized by the [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]] and aimed at the ruling ''[[sanacja]]'' government. It was the largest political protest in the [[Second Polish Republic]],&lt;ref name=realia/&gt; taking place in 12 [[voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]] of the [[Second Polish Republic]].&lt;ref name=realia/&gt; It is estimated that several million peasants took part in the demonstrations,&lt;ref name=realia/&gt; and the strike was supported not only by Polish peasants, but also by the Ukrainian and Belarusian farmers, who made a majority in eastern part of the [[Second Polish Republic]].&lt;ref name="muzeapolskie.pl"/&gt;

==Background==
By mid-1930s, Poland, a country with a large agricultural sector, was significantly affected by the [[Great Depression]],&lt;ref name=realia&gt;{{pl icon}} Janusz  Gmitruk, [http://realia.com.pl/dzial_5/artykul_9.html Rok 1937], ''Realia'', Kwiecień NR 2 (11) 2009&lt;/ref&gt; with peasants being one of the most affected groups.&lt;ref name=realia/&gt; Polish peasantry, especially in overpopulated areas of [[Lesser Poland]], was desperately poor. Prices of food products fell down, which resulted in smaller profits for the peasants. In some provinces, the countryside went backwards to the 19th century, with imminent prospect of hunger. Unemployment among youth in villages was widespread, and this grew radicalization and frustration of the impoverished people.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|title=Piotr Oseka, Kosy przeciw sanacji. Gazeta Wyborcza, 25/08/2007 |url=http://niniwa2.cba.pl/strajki_chlopskie.htm |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ioX620zE?url=http://niniwa2.cba.pl/strajki_chlopskie.htm |archivedate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the increasingly more authoritarian government (''[[sanacja]]'') was losing public support.&lt;ref name=realia/&gt; Immediately after the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]], some leaders of peasant parties hoped that cooperation with the new government was possible. However, further events, such as destruction of [[Centrolew]], arrest of [[Wincenty Witos]], and the ill-fated [[Polish legislative election, 1930|1930 election]] deeply disappointed all of them. In response to the actions of the government, in 1931 a new political party of the peasants, agrarian [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]] (''Stronnictwo Ludowe'', SL) was created out of three smaller parties.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; SL leaders, who by mid-1930s became more radical, emphasized quantity of numerous Polish peasantry and its physical strength. They claimed that peasants were real hosts of the country.

In an attempt to wrest political power, the SL was organizing a series of large demonstrations and strikes; those were often met with government opposition; over the years violent incidents occurred, leading to fatalities.&lt;ref name=realia/&gt; Peasants' protests were frequent, and in all cases they were brutally suppressed by the [[sanacja]] regime. Among most notable events of this kind was a large wave of strikes, which took place in 1932-33 in southern Poland, in the area of [[Lapanow]], [[Lesko]], and [[Ropczyce]].&lt;ref name="muzeapolskie.pl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of History of Polish Peasant Movement in Warsaw. The exhibition of the 70th anniversary of the peasant strike |url=http://www.muzeapolskie.pl/muzea_wyswietl_szczeg.php?obiekt=53&amp;zakladka=3&amp;id=223 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5io6r4qht?url=http://www.muzeapolskie.pl/muzea_wyswietl_szczeg.php?obiekt=53&amp;zakladka=3&amp;id=223 |archivedate=2009-08-05 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of negotiating, the government would send armed police or units of the [[Polish Army]], which pacified villages and sometimes killed the demonstrators. It has been estimated that across 1930s, around 100 peasants were killed by the security forces.

The idea of the strike did not meet with unanimous approval. Marginal [[Communist Party of Poland]] (''Komunistyczna Partia Polski'', KPP) threw its weight behind the strike, but right wing [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] (''Stronnictwo Narodowe'', SN) was opposed to it. Crucially, [[Polish Socialist Party]] (''Polska Partia Socjalistyczna'', PPS) declined to participate in it, so despite KPP support, the strike did not spread to the cities, as SL hoped. Notheless some worker strikes did occur during that period.&lt;ref name=realia/&gt; Even within SL not all activists were convinced it was a good idea; it was supported by [[Wincenty Witos]] and [[Stanisław Mikołajczyk]], but criticized by [[Maciej Rataj]].&lt;ref name=realia/&gt;

The decision to start the strike was the effect of new tactics, worked out during the Extraordinary Congress of the [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]] (SL), which took place on January 17, 1937, in Warsaw. On that day it was decided that if the government did not meet demands of the SL, a general peasant strike would be introduced. Participants in the Congress signed an appeal which demanded democratization of the country, amnesty for politicians sentenced in the [[Brest trials]], and changes in the Constitution. The strike was prepared by Stanisław Mikołajczyk, also by Wincenty Witos, who had been forced to leave Poland and lived in [[Czechoslovakia]]. Using his couriers, Witos sent advice and instructions.&lt;ref name="muzeapolskie.pl"/&gt;

Prelude to the strike took place on April 18, 1937, when peasants organized a large demonstration in the fields of Raclawice, site of a 1792 battle (see [[Battle of Raclawice]]), in which Polish units consisted of several peasant soldiers. On that day, thousands of people gathered, unaware of the fact that Minister [[Felicjan Slawoj-Skladkowski]] had forbidden public demonstrations and meetings. The rally was attacked by the police, which killed 3 peasants.&lt;ref name="annales.umcs.lublin.pl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marek Sioma, Peasant strike in Lesser Poland in the opinion of the government and Gazeta Polska newspaper. Annals of the Marie Curie University in Lublin, 2002 (pdf format) |url=http://www.annales.umcs.lublin.pl/F/2002/10.pdf |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5io72vavx?url=http://www.annales.umcs.lublin.pl/F/2002/10.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-05 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The strike==
August 15 was the [[Holiday of Peasant Activity]] (''Święto Czynu Chłopskiego'').,&lt;ref name=realia/&gt; a holiday introduced to honor participation of Polish peasants in the [[Polish-Soviet War]]. On that day, numerous rallies took place, during which a 10-day nationwide peasant strike was announced. These rallies were carefully organized, as they were supposed to show the power of peasant movement of Poland. One of the biggest events of this kind took place on the market square in [[Kolbuszowa]]. Those present marched with green flags of Polish peasants. During speeches, people were urged to start open struggle until full victory, like back in 1920. Peasants were told that the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Miracle at the Vistula]] was not a miracle, but victory of peasant soldiers. Chants such as "Down with the sanacja government" were heard, also calls for release of political prisoners.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; Participants in the strike pledged not to send food to towns and cities, and also block roads. Timing was crucial, as in mid-August, old food supplies in the cities had been exhausted, and deliveries of new goods were expected to cover shortages. SL activists, who created ''Peasant Order Guard'' (''Chlopska Straz Porzadkowa'') watched the roads, urging all peasants not to weasel out of the strike.&lt;ref name="muzeapolskie.pl"/&gt; The biggest August 15 rallies took place in Jarosław, [[Grebow]], [[Dębica]], [[Przeworsk]], [[Bochnia]], and [[Ciezkowice]].&lt;ref name="annales.umcs.lublin.pl"/&gt;

The strike begun on August 16, 1937, and lasted (as planned) till August 25.&lt;ref name=realia/&gt; SL leaders kept the date of the beginning of the strike as top secret. In his memoirs, an SL activist from [[Bochnia]] wrote: "Everything was carefully prepared. Members of Kraków's district of the party came to our village, instructing us what to do and how to act in case of trouble. We were told to light bonfires on August 14, as a sign that a large meeting of peasants was approaching".&lt;ref name="niniwa2.cba.pl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Piotr Oseka, Kosy przeciw sanacji. Gazeta Wyborcza, 25 August 2007 |url=http://niniwa2.cba.pl/strajki_chlopskie.htm |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ioX620zE?url=http://niniwa2.cba.pl/strajki_chlopskie.htm |archivedate=6 August 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rallies were organized not only in villages and towns, but also in cities. In Kraków, on Sunday, August 15, thousands of peasants with banners and orchestras gathered in the Jablonowski Square. A peasant from Bienczyce, Jakub Pszczola, gave a speech, in which he announced that the strike would begin on the next day. After his speech, leaflets were spread among those gathered, and peasants began singing their informal anthem "Gdy naród do boju" ("When The Nation Fights").&lt;ref name="niniwa2.cba.pl"/&gt; The leaflets informed about demands of the strikers, such as dissolution of the Parliament, release of political prisoners, change of the Constitution, and just distribution of social goods.

Even though SL leadership hoped that the action would cover whole country except for border and ethnically mixed areas, in reality it was successful only in southern part of historical province of [[Lesser Poland]] (Małopolska) region, with major events taking place in eastern counties of the [[Kraków Voivodeship (1919-1939)|Kraków Voivodeship]], and western counties of the [[Lwów Voivodeship]], particularly in the [[Jarosław County]], where the SL structures were the strongest. Peasant demonstrators blockaded roads and stopped food transports to the cities, and at first, the government tolerated the action, regarding it as legal, and convinced that the SL would not be able to expand the protest. Also, as Felicjan Slawoj-Skladkowski stated later, SL leadership had assured that the strike would be of peaceful character. Therefore, Skladkowski had left for a two-week vacation in France, leaving [[Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski]] in charge. This indicated that the government, even though aware of the strike, did not plan to use force.&lt;ref name="annales.umcs.lublin.pl"/&gt; One of peasant activists from the area of [[Sandomierz]] wrote later: "In every village there was a strike committee, with deputies in case of arrests. There were self-reliance organizations, which collected food and money for those incarcerated. Also, families of arrested activists were offered help during the harvest time".&lt;ref name="niniwa2.cba.pl"/&gt;

After a few days, however, this stance was changed and terror was introduced. The change was also spurred by the actions of the peasants themselves, who had become more radical. SL activists created groups of 4 - 10 mostly young men, who were armed with sticks, and watched all roads. They did not hesitate to use force against the [[strikebreaker]], beating them, killing their horses, destroying produce, and overturning their wagons. In some cases, radical activists attacked houses of the strikebreakers. In the course of the time, the strike turned into an uprising, which was noticed by activists of the Polish Communist Party, who appeared in the area, with their propaganda (in their appeal to the nation, the communist stated "Let the cities and villages die! Long live the nationwide strike! They will not arrest millions").&lt;ref name="annales.umcs.lublin.pl"/&gt; First skirmishes took place in the area of Jarosław on August 17, where members of the ''Peasants' Order Guard'' fought the police. On the same day, in Grebow near [[Tarnobrzeg]], first peasant was killed. In response, the peasants blocked the main road of southern Poland, route Kraków - Lwów (in the area of [[Brzesko]]), where transport of all goods was halted. Local police commandant wrote in his report: "On the roads and in their vicinity there are gangs of peasants armed with knives, sticks, perhaps guns. We are defenseless against them. Today, they have formed a march of around 500, which started from Wielka Wies. On the way, more people joined them. Economy in our area has been completely paralyzed. We are requesting help and awaiting orders".&lt;ref name="niniwa2.cba.pl"/&gt; General [[Marian Kukiel]] wrote to [[Wladyslaw Sikorski]]: "The police are completely exhausted. There are losses. There are no police units in Kraków. If the communists were a significant force, they would be taking advantage of this situation".&lt;ref name="niniwa2.cba.pl"/&gt;

Actions of the police were described as cruel and barbarian.&lt;ref name="psl.rzeszow.pl"&gt;{{cite web |title=Official webpage of Rzeszów's office of the Polish People's Party. Main aspects of the 1937 peasant strike |url=http://www.psl.rzeszow.pl/?url=rocznica&amp;id=3 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5io72StPe?url=http://www.psl.rzeszow.pl/?url=rocznica&amp;id=3 |archivedate=2009-08-05 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Officers beat peasants, their wives and children with batons, rallies were dispersed, and during revisions in houses, furniture and goods were destroyed. The police, of whom 108 were wounded, never tried to negotiate, instead, they used not only batons, but also guns, firing at the crowds without warning. Approximately 5,000 peasants were detained, 617 arrested, and in some cases, violence on both sides lead to fatalities (44 peasant demonstrators were killed during the strike, 15 of them coming from the village of Majdan Sieniawski, in [[Przeworsk]] county).&lt;ref name=realia/&gt; Among [[powiat|counties]] with most people arrested, there were:
* [[Jarosław County]] - 61 arrested,
* [[Brzozów County]] - 47 arrested,
* [[Rzeszów County]] - 16 arrested,
* [[Przemyśl County]] - 16 arrested.

About 700 farms were pacified, as the police used the doctrine of [[collective responsibility]]. The number of wounded is difficult to estimate, as in many situations, the peasants did not go to hospitals, fearing arrest.&lt;ref name="psl.rzeszow.pl"/&gt; Nevertheless, despite the repressions, the peasants showed their strength, determination and organizational abilities. SL leaders deliberately chose not to organize the strike in the border areas of the country - [[Pomerania]], [[Upper Silesia]], [[Volhynia]], and the areas of [[Tarnopol]] and [[Wilno]], as deterioration of social situation in those strategic and vulnerable provinces, inhabited by ethnic minorities, was unwanted by them.&lt;ref name="psl.rzeszow.pl"/&gt; Also, since SL structures in [[Mazovia]], [[Podlasie]], [[Greater Poland]], and northern Lesser Poland (areas of [[Kielce]], [[Lublin]], and [[Radom]]) were not as strong as those in the south, the strike there was of a limited character and did not evolve into a mass protest.

==Outcome==
Since the mutual violence of the peasants and the police, among whom there were units of freshly created riot police, was getting out of hand, on August 20 SL leadership decided to stop the strike. The police, which at first was shocked at the magnitude of the protest, took their revenge, pacifying villages and beating participants. This in return provoked hatred of the villagers. First processes of the arrested peasants began in December 1937 in the court in [[Przemyśl]]. Altogether, around 1000 people were sentenced to up to 5 years. Many of them stayed behind bars until September 1939, when prison guards left their posts behind, escaping the advancing German troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Szymon Jakubowski, Forgotten story of a peasants' riot. Article published in Rzeszów's daily Super Nowosci on September 5, 2008 |url=http://aulauvs.sld.cu/theme/standard/styles.php |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iwzoV2qb?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3513&amp;Itemid=60?url=http://aulauvs.sld.cu/theme/standard/styles.php |archivedate=August 11, 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-08-07 |df= }}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strike failed to shift the official balance of power, as ''sanacja'' remained in control. However, it strengthened the Polish peasant movement, and was seen by the peasant activist as a successful demonstration of force.&lt;ref name=realia/&gt; SL activists wanted to organize another strike in 1938, but due to deteriorating international situation, and growing threat of [[Nazi Germany|German]] aggression, it was called off. During World War II, those who took part in the 1937 strike, organized [[Bataliony Chlopskie|Polish Peasants' Battalions]], and after the war, they opposed introduction of the Communist system.

'''Amina – Chechen Republic Online''', popularly known as '''Amina.com''', is a [[Social network service|social networking website]] that includes information on the [[Chechen language]] and culture and [[photography|photos]] of the [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]]s.  It was founded on March 13, 1997 by Albert Digaev, a [[Chechen refugees|Chechen refugee]] living in the [[United States]], as a means of communication for the disparate global [[Chechen people|Chechen]] [[Chechen diaspora|diaspora]] community.

At its inception, it was the first website about [[Chechnya]] on the [[Internet]], and for a while the only one. Taking its name after a well-liked Chechen girl's name, the website initially provided information, links and images about and from Chechnya, [[History of Chechnya|its history]], people, culture and the conflict. After numerous website layout updates, the site has expanded to include [[discussion board|online discussion boards]], [[chatroom]], [[Photo sharing|photo gallery]], and [[email|private email service]].[http://www.chechnyaadvocacy.org/indexamina.html]

Amina – Chechen Republic Online now ranks in the top 25,000 sites based on [[Internet traffic|web traffic]] on the Internet according to the website [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]].[http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=amina.com/] The website's popularity grew to such an extent that it was once closely monitored by the pro-Russian Chechen government.[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/printable/resources_chechnya_print.html]

==Features==
The site, which allows users to write in [[Chechen language|Chechen]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[English language|English]], is free to users and generates revenue from [[advertising]] including [[Web banner|banner ads]].  Features of the website include Chechen Forum, Articles related to Chechnya, Chechen Photo Gallery, Chechen Chat, and Chechen Mail.

===Chechen Forum===
As of May 17, 2007, the Chechen Forum hosted more than 3,500 members and more than 300,000 posts.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070518040223/http://www.amina.com/kamina/]  Although all forum visitors may browse among the various [[Thread (computer science)|threads]], only visitors who have created a free [[Subscription business model|subscription]] account may be able to make forum posts, receive email notifications of replies to posts, and send and receive private messages.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070901050646/http://www.amina.com/kamina/faq.php?faq=vb_user_maintain#faq_vb_why_register] In late April 2007, Albert Digaev added [[English language]] registration to the Chechen Forum, to allow English speakers access and an English language thread to allow English speakers to communicate with Chechens.

===Articles related to Chechnya===
The articles section includes various essays on the Chechen conflict, resources on the Chechen language, and appeals to end the war in Chechnya. Some of the articles' authors include famed [[Russian people|Russian]] journalist [[Andrei Babitsky]], Chechen Ambassador to the [[United States]] [[Lyoma Usmanov]], and U.S. [[Under Secretary for Political Affairs]] [[R. Nicholas Burns]]. The list of articles has not been updated since February 2005.

===Chechen Photo Gallery===
[[Image:ChechenPhotoGallery.png|thumb|Chechen Photo Gallery logo.]]
The Chechen Photo Gallery enables users with a free subscription account to upload photos of themselves and their friends, as well as rate or comment on others' photos.  Although individuals are primarily Chechens, [[Russian people|Russians]] and [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasians]] are well represented in the gallery as well.  Sections of the gallery include Individuals, Girls, Boys, Chechen Television, [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Our Neighbors]], People of the Arts, Children, [[History of Chechnya|Historical Photos]], My Chechnya, and New Photos.

===Chechen Chat===
Chechen Chat is a free [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] service powered by the [[ASP.NET]] [[web application framework]].  Users can [[private message]] directly with other Amina.com users.  This feature was recently reinstated in 2007 after going offline for several months.

===Chechen Mail===
[[Image:ChechenMail.png|thumb|Chechen Mail logo.]]
Chechen Mail is a [[Gmail]]-powered service which enables users to gain access to a private email account with an amina.com [[Domain Name System|domain name]].  When [[Google Apps]] enabled Gmail users to check their email accounts using the [[BlackBerry]] [[wireless]] [[handheld device]], Chechen Mail users by extension gained access to this new feature.  Currently, email signup requires permission from the Amina – Chechen Republic Online [[Network administrator|domain administrator]].

'''Armenians''' ({{lang-hy|հայեր}}, ''[[Romanization of Armenian|hayer]]'' {{IPA-hy|hɑˈjɛɾ|}}) are an [[ethnic group]] native to the [[Armenian Highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Armenia: Ancient and premodern Armenia |last= |first= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher= |access-date=July 17, 2018 |quote=The Armenians, an Indo-European people, first appear in history shortly after the end of the 7th century bce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenians constitute the main population of [[Armenia]] and the ''de facto'' independent [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]]. There is a wide-ranging [[Armenian diaspora|diaspora]] of around 5 million people of full or partial Armenian ancestry living outside modern Armenia. The largest Armenian populations today exist in [[Armenians in Russia|Russia]], the [[Armenian American|United States]], [[Armenians in France|France]], [[Armenians in Georgia|Georgia]], [[Armenians in Iran|Iran]], Germany, [[Armenians in Ukraine|Ukraine]], [[Armenians in Lebanon|Lebanon]], [[Armenians in Brazil|Brazil]] and [[Armenians in Syria|Syria]]. With the exceptions of Iran and the former Soviet states, the present-day Armenian diaspora was formed mainly as a result of the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref name="Hovannisian"&gt;[[Richard G. Hovannisian]], ''The Armenian people from ancient to modern times: the fifteenth century to the twentieth century'', Volume 2, p. 427, Palgrave Macmillan, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Armenians adhere to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], a [[non-Chalcedonian]] church, which is also the world's oldest national church. Christianity began to spread in Armenia soon after Jesus' death, due to the efforts of two of his apostles, [[St. Thaddeus]] and [[St. Bartholomew]].&lt;ref name="HistofChrist"&gt;see {{Cite book|first = Adrian | last = Hastings | title = A World History of Christianity | publisher = Wm.

The unique [[Armenian alphabet]] was invented in 405 AD by [[Mesrop Mashtots]].

== Etymology ==
{{Main article|Name of Armenia}}
[[File:Mkrtum Hovnatanian. Hayk Nahapet.jpeg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Hayk]], the legendary founder of the Armenian nation. Painting by [[Mkrtum Hovnatanian]] (1779–1846)]]
Historically, the name ''Armenian'' has come to internationally designate this group of people. It was first used by neighbouring countries of ancient [[Armenia]]. The earliest attestations of the [[exonym and endonym|exonym]] ''Armenia'' date around the 6th century BC. In his trilingual [[Behistun Inscription]] dated to 517 BC, [[Darius I the Great]] of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] refers to [[Urartu|''Urashtu'']] (in [[Babylonia]]n) as ''[[wikt:𐎠𐎼𐎷𐎡𐎴#Old Persian|Armina]]'' (in [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]; ''[[wikt:𐎠𐎼𐎷𐎡𐎴#Old Persian|Armina]]'' ([[File:Old Persian a.png|30x20pxpx]] [[File:Old Persian ra.png|30x20pxpx]] [[File:Old Persian mi.png|30x20pxpx]] [[File:Old Persian i.png|30x20pxpx]] [[File:Old Persian na.png|30x20pxpx]]) and ''Harminuya'' (in Elamite).
In [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]], {{lang|grc|[[wikt:Ἀρμένιος|Αρμένιοι]]}} "Armenians" is attested from about the same time, perhaps the earliest reference being a fragment attributed to [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] (476&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|grc|Χαλύβοισι πρὸς νότον Ἀρμένιοι ὁμουρέουσι}} (The Armenians border on the [[Chalybes]] to the south)". {{Cite book|last =Chahin|first =Mark|title =The Kingdom of Armenia|publisher =[[Routledge]]|year =2001|location =London|pages = fr. 203|isbn =978-0-7007-1452-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xenophon]], a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions, describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC.

Armenians call themselves ''[[wikt:հայ|Hay]]'' (Հայ, pronounced [ˈhaj]; plural: Հայեր, [haˈjɛɾ]). The name has traditionally been derived from [[Hayk]] ({{lang|hy|Հայկ}}), the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of [[Noah]], who, according to [[Moses of Chorene]], defeated the [[List of Kings of Babylon|Babylonian king]] Bel in [[3rd millennium BC|2492&amp;nbsp;BC]] and established his nation in the [[Ararat, Armenia|Ararat]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Razmik Panossian, The Armenians: From Kings And Priests to Merchants And Commissars, [[Columbia University Press]] (2006), {{ISBN|978-0-231-13926-7}}, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also further postulated&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Ishkhanyan, "Illustrated History of Armenia," Yerevan, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;Elisabeth Bauer. ''Armenia: Past and Present'' (1981), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; that the name ''Hay'' comes from one of the two confederated, [[Hittites|Hittite]] vassal states—the [[Hayasa|Ḫayaša]]-Azzi (1600–1200 BC).

[[Movses Khorenatsi]], the important early medieval Armenian historian, wrote that the word ''Armenian'' originated from the name Armenak or [[Aram (given name)|Aram]] (the descendant of [[Hayk]]).

{{Main article|History of Armenia}}
{{Indo-European}}

=== Origin ===
The [[Armenian Highland]] is the area surrounding [[Mount Ararat]], the highest peak of the region.

A controversial hypothesis put forward by some scholars, such as T. Gamkrelidze and V. Ivanov, has proposed that the [[Indo-European origins|Indo-European homeland]] was around the Armenian Highland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Gamkrelidze]] and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav V. Ivanov]], ''The Early History of Indo-European Languages'', March 1990, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[Armenian language]] is often grouped with [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Ancient Macedonian language|Ancient Macedonian]] ("Helleno-Macedonian") in the [[Graeco-Armenian|Pontic Indo-European (also called Helleno-Armenian)]] subgroup of Indo-European languages by [[Eric P. Hamp]] in his 2012 [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family tree, groups .&lt;ref name=hamp&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamp|first=Eric P.|title=The Expansion of the Indo-European Languages: An Indo-Europeanist's Evolving View|journal=Sino-Platonic Papers|date=August 2013|volume=239|pages=8, 10, 13|url=http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp239_indo_european_languages.pdf|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two possible explanations, not mutually exclusive, for a common origin of the Armenian and Greek languages.
* Ancient Greek scholars, such as [[Herodotus]] (writing circa 440 BC), suggest that the [[Phrygia]]ns of western [[Anatolia]], who spoke an Indo-European language, had also made a contribution to the ethnogenesis of the Armenians: "the Armenians were equipped like Phrygians, being Phrygian colonists" (7.73) (''{{lang|grc|Ἀρμένιοι δὲ κατά περ Φρύγες ἐσεσάχατο, ἐόντες Φρυγῶν ἄποικοι.}}''). This appears to imply that some Phrygians migrated eastward to Armenia following the destruction of Phrygia by a [[Cimmerian]] invasion in the late 7th century BC. Greek scholars also believed that the Phrygians had originated in the [[Balkans]], in an area adjoining Macedonia, from where they had emigrated to Anatolia many centuries earlier. 
* In Hamp's view the homeland of the proposed Greco-Armenian subgroup is the northeast coast of the Black Sea and its hinterlands.&lt;ref name=hamp/&gt; He assumes that they migrated from there southeast through the Caucasus with the Armenians remaining after [[Batumi]] while the pre-Greeks proceeded westwards along the southern coast of the Black Sea.&lt;ref name=hamp/&gt; 

Some genetics studies explain Armenian diversity by several mixtures of Eurasian populations that occurred between ~3,000 and ~2,000 BC. But genetic signals of population mixture cease after ~1,200 BC when Bronze Age civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean world suddenly and violently collapsed. Armenians have since remained isolated and genetic structure within the population developed ~500 years ago when Armenia was divided between the Ottomans and the Safavid Empire in Iran.&lt;ref name=genetics&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ejhg.2015.206 |pmid=26486470|biorxiv=015396|title=Genetic evidence for an origin of the Armenians from Bronze Age mixing of multiple populations|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|volume=24|issue=6|pages=931–6|year=2015|last1=Haber|first1=Marc|last2=Mezzavilla|first2=Massimo|last3=Xue|first3=Yali|last4=Comas|first4=David|last5=Gasparini|first5=Paolo|last6=Zalloua|first6=Pierre|last7=Tyler-Smith|first7=Chris|pmc=4820045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/11/science/study-backs-5th-century-historians-date-for-founding-of-armenia.html?_r=0 | title=Date of Armenia's Birth, Given in 5th Century, Gains Credence| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2015-03-10| last1=Wade| first1=Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Bronze Age]], several states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia, including the [[Hittite Empire]] (at the height of its power), [[Mitanni]] (South-Western historical Armenia), and [[Hayasa-Azzi]] (1600–1200&amp;nbsp;BC). Soon after Hayasa-Azzi came Arme-[[Shupria]] (1300s–1190 BC), the [[Nairi people|Nairi]] (1400–1000&amp;nbsp;BC) and the [[Kingdom of Urartu]] (860–590&amp;nbsp;BC), who successively established their sovereignty over the [[Armenian Highland]]. Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the Armenian people.&lt;ref&gt;Vahan Kurkjian, "History of Armenia", Michigan, 1968, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/home.html History of Armenia by Vahan Kurkjian]; Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia, v. 12, Yerevan 1987; Artak Movsisyan, "Sacred Highland: Armenia in the spiritual conception of the Near East", Yerevan, 2000; Martiros Kavoukjian, "The Genesis of Armenian People", Montreal, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[Ashurbanipal]] (669–627 BC), the [[Assyrian empire]] reached the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (modern [[Armenia]], Georgia and [[Azerbaijan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, John (November 2003).

The [[Satrapy of Armenia|first geographical entity that was called Armenia]] by neighboring peoples (such as by [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] and on the Achaemenid [[Behistun Inscription]]) was established in the late 6th century BC under the [[Orontid dynasty]] within the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]] as part of the latters' territories, and which later became a [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|kingdom]]. At its zenith (95–65&amp;nbsp;BC), the state extended from the Caucasus all the way to what is now central [[Turkey]], [[Lebanon]], and northern [[Iran]]. The imperial reign of [[Tigranes the Great]] is thus the span of time during which Armenia itself conquered areas populated by other peoples.

The [[Arsacid Armenia|Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia]], itself a branch of the [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia]], was the first state to adopt Christianity as its religion (it had formerly been adherent to [[Armenian paganism]], which was influenced by [[Zoroastrianism]],&lt;ref name="Mary Boyce p 84"&gt;Mary Boyce.

It turned Armenia sharply away from its Iranian past and stamped it for centuries with an intrinsic character as clear to the native population as to those outside its borders, who identified Armenia almost at once as the first state to adopt Christianity"''. (Nina Garsoïan in ''Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times'', ed. R.G.

Later on, in order to further strengthen Armenian national identity, [[Mesrop Mashtots]] invented the [[Armenian alphabet]], in 405 AD. This event ushered the [[Golden Age of Armenia]], during which many foreign books and manuscripts were translated to Armenian by Mesrop's pupils. Armenia lost its sovereignty again in 428 AD to the rivalling [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persian]] empires, until the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] overran also the regions in which Armenians lived.

=== Middle Ages ===
In 885 AD the Armenians reestablished themselves as a sovereign kingdom under the leadership of [[Ashot I of Armenia|Ashot I]] of the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratid Dynasty]]. A considerable portion of the Armenian nobility and peasantry fled the Byzantine occupation of Bagratid Armenia in 1045, and the subsequent invasion of the region by [[Seljuk Turks]] in 1064. They settled in large numbers in [[Cilicia]], an Anatolian region where Armenians were already established as a minority since Roman times. In 1080, they founded an independent [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian Principality then Kingdom of Cilicia]], which became the focus of Armenian nationalism. The Armenians developed close social, cultural, military, and religious ties with nearby [[Crusader States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hodgson|first1=Natasha|editor1-last=Kostick|editor1-first=Conor|title=The Crusades and the Near East: Cultural Histories|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1136902475|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAPGBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually succumbed to [[Mamluk]] invasions. In the next few centuries, [[Djenghis Khan]], [[Timurids]], and the tribal Turkic federations of the [[Ak Koyunlu]] and the [[Kara Koyunlu]] ruled over the Armenians.

=== Modern history ===
[[File:Morgenthau336.jpg|thumb|About 1.5&amp;nbsp;million Armenians were killed during the [[Armenian Genocide]] in 1915–1918.]]
The [[ethnic cleansing]] of Armenians during the final years of the Ottoman Empire is widely considered a [[genocide]], resulting in an estimated 1.5&amp;nbsp;million victims. The first wave of persecution was in the years 1894 to 1896, the second one culminating in the events of the [[Armenian Genocide]] in 1915 and 1916. With [[World War I]] in progress, the Ottoman Empire accused the (Christian) Armenians as liable to ally with [[Imperial Russia]], and used it as a pretext to deal with the entire Armenian population as an enemy within their empire.

Governments of the Republic of Turkey since that time have consistently rejected charges of genocide, typically arguing either that those Armenians who died were simply in the way of a war, or that killings of Armenians were justified by their individual or collective support for the enemies of the Ottoman Empire. Passage of legislation in various foreign countries, condemning the persecution of the Armenians as genocide, has often provoked diplomatic conflict. (See [[Recognition of the Armenian Genocide]])

Following the breakup of the Russian Empire in the [[aftermath of World War I]] for a brief period, from 1918 to 1920, Armenia was an [[Democratic Republic of Armenia|independent republic]]. In late 1920, the [[Communist Party of Armenia (Soviet Union)|communist]]s came to power following an invasion of Armenia by the [[Red Army]]; in 1922, Armenia became part of the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] of the [[Soviet Union]], later on forming the [[Armenian SSR|Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (1936 to 21 September 1991).  In 1991, Armenia declared independence from the [[USSR]] and established the second Republic of Armenia.

=== Armenia ===
Armenians have had a presence in the [[Armenian Highland]] for over 4,000 years, since the time when [[Hayk]], the legendary patriarch and founder of the first Armenian nation, led them to victory over [[Belus (Assyrian)|Bel]] of [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Vahan Kurkjian, "History of Armenia", Michigan, 1968, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/home.html History of Armenia by Vahan Kurkjian]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, with a population of 3.5&amp;nbsp;million, they not only constitute an overwhelming majority in Armenia, but also in the disputed region of [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]]. Armenians in the diaspora informally refer to them as ''Hayastantsi''s (Հայաստանցի), meaning those that are from Armenia (that is, those born and raised in Armenia).  They, as well as the Armenians of Iran and Russia speak the Eastern dialect of the Armenian language.  The country itself is secular as a result of Soviet domination, but most of its citizens identify themselves as Apostolic Armenian Christian.

{{Armenian population count by country|size=2}}

=== Diaspora ===
{{Main article|Armenian diaspora}}
Small Armenian trading and religious communities have existed outside Armenia for centuries.  For example, a community survived for over a millennium in the [[Holy Land]], and one of the four-quarters of the walled [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]] has been called the [[Armenian Quarter]].&lt;ref name="Jerusalem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holyland.org/ |title=Armenian Quarter in Jerusalem |accessdate=2007-02-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307133102/http://www.holyland.org/ |archivedate=7 March 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An Armenian Catholic [[San Lazzaro degli Armeni|monastic community]] of 35 founded in 1717 exists on an island near [[Venice, Italy]]. There are also remnants of formerly populous communities in [[Armenians in India|India]], [[Armenians in Myanmar|Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Belgium]], [[Portugal]], Italy, [[Israel]], [[Poland]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Regardless, most of the modern days diaspora consists of Armenians scattered throughout the world as a direct consequence of the genocide of 1915, constituting the main portion of the [[Armenian diaspora]]. However, Armenian communities in the Georgian capital city of [[Tbilisi]], in [[Syria]] and in [[Iran]] existed since [[ancient history|antiquity]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Within the diasporan Armenian community, there is an unofficial classification of the different ''kinds'' of Armenians. For example, Armenians who originate from Iran are referred to as [[Armenian-Iranian|''Parskahay'']] (Պարսկահայ), while Armenians from Lebanon are usually referred to as [[Armenians in Lebanon|''Lipananahay'']] (Լիբանանահայ). Armenians of the Diaspora are the primary speakers of the Western dialect of the Armenian language. This dialect has considerable differences with Eastern Armenian, but speakers of either of the two variations can usually understand each other. Eastern Armenian in the diaspora is primarily spoken in Iran and European countries such as Ukraine, Russia, and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (where they form a majority in the [[Samtskhe-Javakheti]] province).  In diverse communities (such as in Canada and the U.S.) where many different kinds of Armenians live together, there is a tendency for the different groups to cluster together.

Before Christianity, Armenians adhered to [[Armenian paganism]]: a type of indigenous polytheism that stemmed from the [[Urartu]] period but which adopted several Greco-Roman and Iranian religious characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Ancient History. vol. 12, p. 486.

In 301&amp;nbsp;AD, Armenia adopted Christianity as a state religion, becoming the first state to do so.&lt;ref name="HistofChrist"/&gt; The claim is primarily based on the fifth-century work of [[Agathangelos]] titled "The History of the Armenians." [[Agathangelos]] witnessed at first hand the baptism of the Armenian King [[Trdat III]] (c. 301/314 A.D.) by St. [[Gregory the Illuminator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/agathangelos/en/AGATHANGELOS.html '''Agathangelos''', History of St. Gregory and the Conversion of Armenia]&lt;/ref&gt; Trdat III decreed Christianity was the state religion.&lt;ref&gt;Agathangelos, History of the Armenians, Robert W. Thomson, State University of New York Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia established a Church that still exists independently of both the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches, having become so in 451&amp;nbsp;AD as a result of its stance regarding the [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref name="HistofChrist"/&gt; Today this church is known as the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], which is a part of the [[Oriental Orthodox]] communion, not to be confused with the [[Eastern Orthodox]] communion. During its later political eclipses, Armenia depended on the church to preserve and protect its unique identity. The original location of the Armenian Catholicosate is Echmiadzin. However, the continuous upheavals, which characterized the political scenes of Armenia, made the political power move to safer places. The Church center moved as well to different locations together with the political authority. Therefore, it eventually moved to [[Cilicia]] as the [[Holy See of Cilicia]].&lt;ref name="Prelacy"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.armenianprelacy.ca/history2.htm | title= A Migrating Catholicosate | accessdate= 2007-02-27 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080403151557/http://www.armenianprelacy.ca/history2.htm | archivedate= 3 April 2008 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armenians collective has, at times, constituted a Christian "island" in a mostly [[Muslim]] region. There is, however, a minority of ethnic Armenian Muslims, known as [[Hamshenis]] but many Armenians view them as a separate race, while the [[history of the Jews in Armenia]] dates back 2,000 years. The [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] had close ties to European [[Crusader States]]. Later on, the deteriorating situation in the region led the bishops of Armenia to elect a Catholicos in Etchmiadzin, the original seat of the Catholicosate. In 1441, a new Catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin in the person of Kirakos Virapetsi, while Krikor Moussapegiants preserved his title as Catholicos of Cilicia. Therefore, since 1441, there have been two Catholicosates in the Armenian Church with equal rights and privileges, and with their respective jurisdictions. The primacy of honor of the Catholicosate of Etchmiadzin has always been recognized by the Catholicosate of Cilicia.&lt;ref name="Prelacy2"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.armenianprelacy.ca/history3.htm | title= Two Catholicosates within the Armenian Church | accessdate= 2007-02-27 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080524035850/http://www.armenianprelacy.ca/history3.htm | archivedate= 24 May 2008 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Armenian Apostolic Church remains the most prominent church in the Armenian community throughout the world, Armenians (especially in the diaspora) subscribe to any number of other Christian denominations. These include the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] (which follows its own liturgy but recognizes the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] Pope), the [[Armenian Evangelical Church]], which started as a reformation in the Mother church but later broke away, and the [[Armenian Brotherhood Church]], which was born in the Armenian Evangelical Church, but later broke apart from it.  There are other numerous Armenian churches belonging to Protestant denominations of all kinds.

Through the ages many Armenians have collectively belonged to other faiths or Christian movements, including the [[Paulicians]] which is a form of Gnostic and Manichaean Christianity.  Paulicians sought to restore the pure Christianity of Paul and in c.660 founded the first congregation in Kibossa, Armenia.

Another example is the [[Tondrakians]], who flourished in medieval Armenia between the early 9th century and 11th century.  Tondrakians advocated the abolishment of the church, denied the immortality of the soul, did not believe in an afterlife, supported property rights for peasants, and equality between men and women.

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Armenians or the Chalcedonian Armenians in the Byzantine Empire were called Iberians ("Georgians") or "Greeks". See [[Gregory Pakourianos]] – the great Byzantine general. Their descendants are the [[Hayhurum]] and Catholic Armenians in Georgia.

=== Language and literature ===
[[File:Sargis Pitsak.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|A 14th-century Armenian illuminated manuscript]]
{{Main article|Armenian language|Armenian literature}}

Armenian is a sub-branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family, and with some 8 million speakers one of the smallest surviving branches, comparable to [[Albanian language|Albanian]] or the somewhat more widely spoken [[Greek language|Greek]], with which it may be connected (see [[Graeco-Armenian]]). Today, that branch has just one language – Armenian.

Five million Eastern Armenian speakers live in the Caucasus, Russia, and Iran, and approximately two to three million people in the rest of the [[Armenian diaspora]] speak Western Armenian. According to US Census figures, there are 300,000 Americans who speak Armenian at home.  It is in fact the twentieth most commonly spoken language in the United States, having slightly fewer speakers than [[Haitian Creole]], and slightly more than [[Navajo language|Navajo]].

Armenian literature dates back to 400&amp;nbsp;AD, when Mesrop Mashtots first invented the [[Armenian alphabet]]. This period of time is often viewed as the [[Golden Age]] of Armenian literature. Early Armenian literature was written by the "father of Armenian history", [[Moses of Chorene]], who authored ''[[The History of Armenia]]''. The book covers the time-frame from the formation of the Armenian people to the fifth century AD. The nineteenth century beheld a great literary movement that was to give rise to modern Armenian literature. This period of time, during which Armenian culture flourished, is known as the Revival period (Zartonki sherchan). The Revivalist authors of [[Constantinople]] and [[Tiflis]], almost identical to the Romanticists of Europe, were interested in encouraging Armenian nationalism. Most of them adopted the newly created Eastern or Western variants of the Armenian language depending on the targeted audience, and preferred them over classical Armenian (grabar). This period ended after the [[Hamidian massacres]], when Armenians experienced turbulent times. As Armenian history of the 1920s and of the Genocide came to be more openly discussed, writers like [[Paruyr Sevak]], [[Gevork Emin]], [[Silva Kaputikyan]] and [[Hovhannes Shiraz]] began a new era of literature.

=== Architecture ===
{{Main article|Armenian architecture}}
[[File:Khatchkar at Goshavank Monastery in Armenia.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The famous [[Khachkar]] at [[Goshavank]], carved in 1291 by the artist Poghos.]]
The first Armenian churches were built on the orders of [[St. Gregory the Illuminator]], and were often built on top of pagan temples, and imitated some aspects of Armenian pre-Christian architecture.&lt;ref name="tacentral"&gt;[http://www.tacentral.com/architecture.asp?story_no=2 Sacred Geometry and Armenian Architecture | Armenia Travel, History, Archeology &amp; Ecology | TourArmenia | Travel Guide to Armenia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical and Medieval Armenian Architecture is divided into four separate periods.

The first Armenian churches were built between the 4th and 7th century, beginning when Armenia converted to Christianity, and ending with the Arab invasion of Armenia. The early churches were mostly simple [[basilica]]s, but some with side apses. By the fifth century the typical cupola cone in the center had become widely used. By the seventh century, centrally planned churches had been built and a more complicated ''niched buttress'' and radiating ''Hrip'simé'' style had formed. By the time of the Arab invasion, most of what we now know as classical Armenian architecture had formed.

From the 9th to 11th century, Armenian architecture underwent a revival under the patronage of the [[Bagratuni dynasty|Bagratid]] Dynasty with a great deal of building done in the area of [[Lake Van]], this included both traditional styles and new innovations. Ornately carved Armenian [[Khachkars]] were developed during this time.&lt;ref name="past"&gt;Armenia, Past and Present; Elisabeth Bauer, Jacob Schmidheiny, Frederick Leist, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Many new cities and churches were built during this time, including a new capital at [[Lake Van]] and a new Cathedral on [[Akdamar Island]] to match. The [[Cathedral of Ani]] was also completed during this dynasty. It was during this time that the first major monasteries, such as [[Haghpat Monastery|Haghpat]] and [[Haritchavank Monastery|Haritchavank]] were built. This period was ended by the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] invasion.

=== Sports ===
{{Main article|Sport in Armenia}}
[[File:Armenian children.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Armenian children at the UN Cup Chess Tournament in 2005.]]
Many types of sports are played in Armenia, among the most popular being [[association football|football]], [[chess]], [[boxing]], [[basketball]], [[hockey]], [[Sambo (martial art)|sambo]], [[wrestling]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] and [[volleyball]].&lt;ref name="Sport"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.worldinfozone.com/country.php?country=Armenia&amp;page=2 |title= Sport in Armenia|accessdate=2007-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since independence, the Armenian government has been actively rebuilding its sports program in the country.

During Soviet rule, Armenian athletes rose to prominence winning plenty of medals and helping the [[USSR]] win the medal standings at the Olympics on numerous occasions. The first medal won by an Armenian in modern Olympic history was by [[Hrant Shahinyan]], who won two golds and two silvers in gymnastics at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. In football, their most successful team was [[FC Ararat Yerevan|Yerevan's FC Ararat]], which had claimed most of the Soviet championships in the 70s and had also gone to post victories against professional clubs like [[FC Bayern Munich]] in the Euro cup.

Armenians have also been successful in chess, which is the most popular mind sport in Armenia. Some of the most prominent chess players in the world are Armenian such as [[Tigran Petrosian]], [[Levon Aronian]] and [[Garry Kasparov]]. Armenians have also been successful in weightlifting and wrestling ([[Armen Nazaryan]]), winning medals in each sport at the Olympics.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} There are also successful Armenians in [[football]] –  [[Henrikh Mkhitaryan]], [[boxing]] – [[Arthur Abraham]] and [[Vic Darchinyan]].

Armenian music is a mix of indigenous folk music, perhaps best-represented by [[Djivan Gasparyan]]'s well-known [[duduk]] music, as well as light pop, and extensive [[Christian music]].

Instruments like the duduk, the [[dhol]], the [[zurna]] and the [[Qanun (instrument)|kanun]] are commonly found in Armenian folk music. Artists such as [[Sayat Nova]] are famous due to their influence in the development of Armenian folk music. One of the oldest types of Armenian music is the [[Armenian chant]] which is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia. Many of these chants are ancient in origin, extending to pre-Christian times, while others are relatively modern, including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet. Whilst under Soviet rule, Armenian classical music composer [[Aram Khatchaturian]] became internationally well known for his music, for various ballets and the [[Sabre Dance]] from his composition for the ballet [[Gayane (ballet)|Gayane]].

The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world. Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music. In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States, the so-called "kef" style Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and some western instruments, was popular. This style preserved the folk songs and dances of [[Western Armenia]], and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated. [[Richard Hagopian]] is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional "kef" style and the [[Vosbikian Band]] was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of "kef music" heavily influenced by the popular American [[Big Band]] Jazz of the time. Later, stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European (especially French) pop music, the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as [[Adiss Harmandian]] and [[Harout Pamboukjian]] performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia. Also with artists such as [[Sirusho]], performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today's entertainment industry. Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned [[List of French-Armenians|French-Armenian]] singer and composer [[Charles Aznavour]], pianist [[Sahan Arzruni]], prominent opera sopranos such as [[Hasmik Papian]] and more recently [[Isabel Bayrakdarian]] and [[Anna Kasyan]]. Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band [[System of a Down]] (which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs) or pop star [[Cher]]. [[Ruben Hakobyan (Ruben Sasuntsi)]] is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent. In the Armenian diaspora, [[Armenian Revolutionary Songs]] are popular with the youth.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes.

=== Carpet weaving ===
{{See also|Armenian carpet}}
[[File:Van Armenian Weavers.jpeg|thumb|Armenian girls, weaving carpets in Van, 1907, [[Ottoman Empire]]]]
Carpet-weaving is historically a major traditional profession for the majority of Armenian women, including many Armenian families. Prominent Karabakh carpet weavers there were men too. The oldest extant [[Armenian carpet]] from the region, referred to as [[Artsakh (historic province)|Artsakh]] (see also [[Karabakh carpet]]) during the medieval era, is from the village of Banants (near [[Gandzak, Armenia|Gandzak]]) and dates to the early 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
|last= Hakobyan|first=Hravard H.|title=The Medieval Art of Artsakh|publisher=Parberakan|location=Yerevan, Armenian SSR|year=1990|page= 84|isbn= 978-5-8079-0195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time that the Armenian word for carpet, ''gorg'', was used in historical sources was in a 1242–1243 Armenian inscription on the wall of the Kaptavan Church in Artsakh.&lt;ref name="Hakobyan. p. 84"&gt;Hakobyan. ''Medieval Art of Artsakh'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common themes and patterns found on Armenian carpets were the depiction of dragons and eagles. They were diverse in style, rich in color and ornamental motifs, and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them, such as ''artsvagorgs'' (eagle-carpets), ''vishapagorgs'' (dragon-carpets) and ''otsagorgs'' (serpent-carpets).&lt;ref name="Hakobyan. p. 84"/&gt; The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches, "covered with vegatative ornaments", and bears an artistic resemblance to the [[illuminated manuscripts]] produced in Artsakh.&lt;ref name="Hakobyan. p. 84"/&gt;

The art of carpet weaving was in addition intimately connected to the making of curtains as evidenced in a passage by [[Kirakos Gandzaketsi]], a 13th-century Armenian historian from Artsakh, who praised Arzu-Khatun, the wife of regional prince Vakhtang Khachenatsi, and her daughters for their expertise and skill in weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} [[Kirakos Gandzaketsi]]. ''Պատմություն Հայոց '' (''History of Armenia''). Yerevan, Armenian SSR: [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], 1961, p. 216, as cited in Hakobyan. ''Medieval Art of Artsakh'', p. 84, note 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenian carpets were also renowned by foreigners who traveled to Artsakh; the Arab geographer and historian [[Al-Masudi]] noted that, among other works of art, he had never seen such carpets elsewhere in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ulubabyan|first=Bagrat A.|authorlink =Bagrat Ulubabyan|title=Խաչենի իշխանությունը, X-XVI դարերում (The Principality of Khachen, From the 10th to 16th Centuries)|publisher=Armenian Academy of Sciences|location=Yerevan, Armenian SSR|year=1975|page=267|isbn=|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main article|Armenian cuisine}}
[[File:Khorovats.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Khorovats]] is a favorite Armenian dish]]
[[Khorovats]], an Armenian-styled barbecue, is arguably the favorite Armenian dish. [[Lavash]] is a very popular Armenian flat bread, and Armenian paklava is a popular dessert made from filo dough. Other famous Armenian foods include the [[kabob]] (a skewer of marinated roasted meat and vegetables), various dolmas (minced lamb, or beef meat and rice wrapped in grape leaves, cabbage leaves, or stuffed into hollowed vegetables), and [[pilaf]], a rice dish. Also, [[ghapama]], a rice-stuffed pumpkin dish,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armeniapedia.org/wiki/Ghapama&lt;/ref&gt; and many different salads are popular in Armenian culture. Fruits play a large part in the Armenian diet. [[Apricots]] (''Prunus armeniaca'', also known as [[Armenian Plum]]) have been grown in Armenia for centuries and have a reputation for having an especially good flavor. [[Peach]]es are popular as well, as are grapes, [[figs]], [[pomegranate]]s, and melons. Preserves are made from many fruits, including cornelian cherries, young walnuts, sea buckthorn, mulberries, sour cherries, and many others.

'''Arte Povera''' ({{IPA-it|ˈarte ˈpɔːvera|pron}}; literally ''poor art'') is a [[contemporary art]] movement. The Arte Povera movement took place between the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s in major cities throughout Italy and above all in [[Turin]]. Other cities where the movement was also important are [[Milan]], [[Rome]], [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Naples]] and [[Bologna]]. The term was coined by Italian art critic [[Germano Celant]] in 1967&lt;ref name=“veconomist” &gt;{{cite news|author=J.U-S.|title=Arte Povera’s radical simplicity|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2017/10/post-war-art|work=[[The Economist]]|date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced in [[Italy]] during the period of upheaval at the end of the 1960s, when artists were taking a [[Political radicalism|radical]] stance.&lt;ref name=MOMA&gt;{{cite web|title=Arte Povera|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10454|work=MoMA: The Collection|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists began attacking the values of established institutions of government, industry, and culture.

The exhibition "Im Spazio" (The Space of Thoughts), curated by Celant and held at the Galleria La Bertesca in Genoa, Italy, from September through October 1967, is often considered to be the official starting point of Arte Povera.&lt;ref name=MOMA /&gt; Celant, who became one of Arte Povera's major proponents, organized two exhibitions in 1967 and 1968, followed by an influential book published by Electa in 1985 called ''Arte Povera Storie e protagonisti/Arte Povera. Histories and Protagonists'', promoting the notion of a revolutionary art, free of convention, the power of structure, and the market place.

Although Celant attempted to encompass the radical elements of the entire international scene, the term properly centered on a group of Italian artists who attacked the corporate mentality with an art of unconventional materials and style. Key figures closely associated with the movement are [[Giovanni Anselmo]], [[Alighiero Boetti]], [[Enrico Castellani]], [[Pier Paolo Calzolari]], [[Luciano Fabro]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Marisa Merz]], [[Giulio Paolini]], [[Pino Pascali]], [[Giuseppe Penone]],  [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Emilio Prini]], and [[Gilberto Zorio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christov-Bakargiev|first=Carolyn|title=Arte Povera|year=2005|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0-7148-4556-6|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They often used [[found object]]s in their works. Other early exponents of radical change in the visual arts include proto Arte Povera artists: [[Antoni Tàpies]] and the [[Dau al Set]] movement, [[Alberto Burri]], [[Piero Manzoni]], and [[Lucio Fontana]] and [[Spatialism]]. Art dealer [[Ileana Sonnabend]] was a champion of the movement.&lt;Ref name=“veconomist” /&gt;

==Trends and concepts==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
* A return to simple objects and messages
* The body and behavior are art
* The everyday becomes meaningful
* Traces of nature and industry appear
* Dynamism and energy are embodied in the work
* Nature can be documented in its physical and chemical transformation
* Explore the notion of space and language
* Complex and symbolic signs lose meaning
* Ground Zero, no culture, no art system, Art = Life

==Artists==
[[Michelangelo Pistoletto]] began painting on mirrors in 1962, connecting painting with the constantly changing realities in which the work finds itself. In the later 1960s he began bringing together rags with casts of omnipresent classical statuary of Italy to break down the hierarchies of "art" and common things. An art of impoverished materials is certainly one aspect of the definition of ''Arte Povera''. In his 1967 ''Muretto di straci'' (''Rag Wall'') Pistoletto makes an exotic and opulent tapestry wrapping common bricks in discarded scraps of fabric.

[[Jannis Kounellis]] and [[Mario Merz]] attempted to make the experience of art more immediately real while also more closely connecting the individual to nature. In his ''(Untitled /Twelve Horses)'', Kounellis brings the real, natural life into the gallery setting, by showing twelve horses racked-up on the gallery walls. Recalling the [[Dada]] movement and [[Marcel Duchamp]], his aim was to challenge what could be defined as art, but unlike Duchamp, maintains the objects real and alive, redefining the notion of life and art, while keeping both entities independent.{{Quote | text=The 'reality effect' is not secondary but constitutive.(...)Kounellis shifts the frontier of what can be defined as art, but there is never the idea that art should be dissolved into life. On the contrary, art is given a new message as a rite of initiation through which to re-experience life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lumley|first=Robert|title=Movements in Modern Art, Povera Arte|year=2004|publisher=Tate|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Piero Gilardi]], much like the aim of Arte Povera itself, was concerned with bridging the natural and the artificial. In his ''(Nature Carpets)'', 1965, which gained him recognition and assimilation into the Arte Povera movement, Gilardi built three-dimensional carpets out of [[polyurethane]] which used "natural" leaves, rocks, and soil as decoration, design and art meshed together to question societal sensibilities towards what is real and natural and how artificiality was being engrained into the contemporary commercialized world.

'''''Cannabis'' strains''' are either pure or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] of the plant genus ''[[Cannabis]]'', which encompasses the species ''[[Cannabis sativa|C. sativa]]'', ''[[Cannabis indica|C. indica]]'' and ''[[Cannabis ruderalis|C. ruderalis]]''.

Varieties are developed to intensify specific characteristics of the plant, or to differentiate the [[Strain (biology)|strain]] for the purposes of marketing or to make it more effective as a [[Cannabis (drug)|drug]]. Variety names are typically chosen by their [[Cannabis cultivation|growers]], and often reflect properties of the plant such as taste, color, smell, or the origin of the variety.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Cannabis strains commonly refer to those varieties with [[Cannabis (drug)|recreational and medicinal use]]. These varieties have been cultivated to contain a high percentage of [[cannabinoid]]s. Several varieties of ''Cannabis'', known as [[hemp]], have a very low cannabinoid content, and are instead grown for their fiber and seed.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Taxonomic paradigm===
The two species of the Cannabis genus that are most commonly grown are ''[[Cannabis indica]]'' and ''[[Cannabis sativa]]''.&lt;ref name="small1976a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Small | first1 = E. | last2 = Cronquist | first2 = A. | year = 1976 | title = A practical and natural taxonomy for ''Cannabis'' | url = | journal = Taxon | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 405–435 | doi=10.2307/1220524| jstor = 1220524 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third species, ''[[Cannabis ruderalis]]'', is very short and produces only trace amounts of [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC), and thus is not commonly grown for industrial, recreational or medicinal use. However, because ''Cannabis ruderalis'' flowers independently of the [[photoperiod]] and according to age, it has been used to breed [[Autoflowering cannabis|autoflowering]] strains.&lt;ref name="Greg Green"&gt;{{cite book | last =Greg Green | title = The Cannabis Grow Bible | edition = 4th | year =2001|page = 47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure ''sativas'' are relatively tall (reaching as high as 4.5 meters), with long [[Internode (botany)|internodes]] and branches, and large, narrow-bladed leaves. Pure ''indica'' varieties are shorter and bushier, have wider leaflets. They are often favored by indoor growers for their size. ''Sativas'' bloom later than ''indicas'', often taking a month or two longer to mature. The subjective effects of ''sativas'' and ''indicas'' are said to differ, but the ratio of [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) to [[cannabidiol|cannabidiol (CBD)]] in most named drug varieties of both types is similar (averaging about 200:1). Unlike most commercially developed strains, ''indica'' landraces exhibit plants with varying THC/CBD ratios.&lt;ref name="hillig2004a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hillig | first1 = Karl W. | last2 = Mahlberg | first2 = Paul G. | year = 2004 | title = A chemotaxonomic analysis of cannabinoid variation in ''Cannabis'' (Cannabaceae) | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/abstract/91/6/966 | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 91 | issue = 6| pages = 966–975 | doi=10.3732/ajb.91.6.966 | pmid=21653452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avidekel, a medical marijuana strain developed in Israel, has a very low content of THC but a high content of CBD, limiting its recreational value but maximizing medical effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/biotechnology/medical-marijuana-thc-120706.htm |title=Marijuana That Doesn't Get You Stoned |last=Halverson |first=Nic |date=July 6, 2012 |website=Discovery Channel |publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative classifications===
There is an increasing discussion whether the existing paradigm of the difference between species adequately represents the variability found within the genus ''Cannabis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piomelli|first=Daniele|last2=Russo|first2=Ethan B.|date=2016-01-14|title=The Cannabis sativa Versus Cannabis indica Debate: An Interview with Ethan Russo, MD|journal=Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research|volume=1|issue=1|pages=44–46|doi=10.1089/can.2015.29003.ebr|pmid=28861479|pmc=5576603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aizpurua-ppOlaizola|first=Oier|last2=Omar|first2=Jone|last3=Navarro|first3=Patricia|last4=Olivares|first4=Maitane|last5=Etxebarria|first5=Nestor|last6=Usobiaga|first6=Aresatz|date=2014-10-23|title=Identification and quantification of cannabinoids in Cannabis sativa L. plants by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|language=en|volume=406|issue=29|pages=7549–7560|doi=10.1007/s00216-014-8177-x|pmid=25338935|issn=1618-2642}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hazekamp|first=A.|last2=Fischedick|first2=J.

There are five chemotaxonomic types of ''Cannabis'': one with high levels of THC, one which is more fibrous and has higher levels of CBD, one that is an intermediate between the two, another one with high levels of [[cannabigerol]] (CBG), and the last one almost without cannabinoids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mandolino|first=Giuseppe|last2=Bagatta|first2=Manuela|last3=Carboni|first3=Andrea|last4=Ranalli|first4=Paolo|last5=Meijer|first5=Etienne de|date=2003-03-01|title=Qualitative and Quantitative Aspects of the Inheritance of Chemical Phenotype in Cannabis|journal=Journal of Industrial Hemp|volume=8|issue=2|pages=51–72|doi=10.1300/J237v08n02_04|issn=1537-7881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been a recent movement &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5821/9d65278453f8ebff93231f49bf605ff4cacd.pdf |title=Therapeutic Satisfaction and Subjective Effects of Different Strains of Pharmaceutical-Grade Cannabis |last=Renolds |first=Robert |date=June 15, 2014 |website=Psychopharmacology |publisher=Wolters Kluwer - Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to characterize strains based on their reported subjective effects. For example, WoahStork has used machine learning algorithms to classify strains into six Distinct Activity groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.woahstork.com/strains |title=WoahStork's Strain Activity Groups |last=Reggente |first=Nicco |date=February 15, 2016 |website=WoahStork |publisher=WoahStork |accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breeding==
[[File:Kush-trichome-closeup.jpg|thumb|left|A flowering [[cannabis]] plant]]
[[file:White widow.jpg|left|thumb|White Widow]]

In addition to pure ''indica'', ''sativa'', and ''ruderalis'' varieties, hybrid varieties with varying ratios of these three types are common. For example, the [[White widow (cannabis)|White Widow]] hybrid containing about 60% ''indica'' and 40% ''sativa'' ancestry. These hybrid varieties exhibit traits from both parental types. There are also commercial [[Crossbreed|crossbred]] [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] which contain a mix of both ruderalis, indica or sativa genes, and are usually [[Autoflowering cannabis|autoflowering]] varieties. These varieties are bred mostly for the medicinal cannabis market, since they are not very appreciated by recreational cannabis users because ''ruderalis'' varieties are lower in THC and impart a slightly unpleasant taste.  "''L''owryder" was an early auto-flowering hybrid that retained the flowering behavior of ''ruderalis'' plants, while also producing appreciable amounts of [[THC]] and [[Cannabidiol|CBD]]. Autoflowering cannabis varieties have the advantage of being discreet due to their small stature. They also require shorter growing periods, as well as having the additional advantage that they do not rely on a change in the [[photoperiod]] to determine when to flower.

Breeding requires pollinating a female cannabis plant with male pollen. Although this occurs spontaneously and ubiquitously in nature, the intentional creation of new varieties typically involves selective breeding in a controlled environment.

When cannabis is cultivated for its psychoactive or medicinal properties, male plants will often be separated from females. This prevents the fertilization of the female plants, either to facilitate [[Cannabis (drug) cultivation|sinsemilla]] flowering or to provide more control over which male is chosen. Pollen produced by the male is caught and stored until it is needed.

When a male plant of one strain pollinates a female of another strain, the seeds will be [[F1 hybrid]]s of the male and female. These offspring will not be identical to their parents. Instead, they will have characteristics of both parents. Repeated breeding results in certain characteristics appearing with greater regularity.

It is impossible for a hermaphrodite to create any male only plants. A hermaphrodite may create female only seeds and hermaphrodite seeds. Also the female only seeds may carry the hermaphrodite trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kindgreenbuds.com/cannabis-grow-bible/selfing/ |title=Selfing - Cannabis Grow Bible |publisher=Kindgreenbuds.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common technique to stabilize a cannabis variety is called "cubing".{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} A breeder seeking specific traits in the hybrid offspring (for example, greater resin production or tighter node spacing) will breed hybrid plants most exemplifying these characteristics with a parent plant. The same traits are sought in the new inbred offspring, which are then again bred with the original parent plant. This process is called cubing because it usually repeated across three, or possibly more generations before the variety's genetics are acceptably stable.

In a retail market that is decriminalised such as in [[The Netherlands]], where wholesale production is illegal but prosecutions are not always enforced because of the contradiction of the law that is recognised by the courts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oct 20, 2014 |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-10-dutch-court-illegal-cannabis-growers.html |title=Dutch court refuses to punish illegal cannabis growers |publisher=Phys.org |date=2014-10-20 |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, competition puts pressure on breeders to create increasingly attractive varieties to maintain market share. Breeders give their strains distinct and memorable names in order to help differentiate them from their competitors' strains, although they may in fact be very similar.

Popular strains are incorporated into new hybrids, which often bear a similar name to their parent. This phenomenon has occurred with [[Haze (cannabis)|Haze]] and [[Sour (cannabis)|Sour]] varieties, amongst others.

'''Charles Eliot Norton''' (November 16, 1827 – October 21, 1908) was an [[United States|American]] author, social critic, and professor of art. He was a progressive social reformer and a liberal activist whom many of his contemporaries considered the most cultivated man in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{see also|Eliot family}}
Norton was born at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].  His father, [[Andrews Norton]] (1786–1853), was a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] theologian, and Dexter professor of sacred literature at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]; his mother was Catherine Eliot, a daughter of the merchant [[Samuel Eliot (banker)|Samuel Eliot]]. [[Charles William Eliot]], president of Harvard, was his cousin. Norton graduated from Harvard in 1846, where he was a member of the [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals|Hasty Pudding]], and started in business with an East Indian trading firm in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], travelling to [[India]] in 1849. After a tour in [[Europe]], where he was influenced by John Ruskin and pre-Raphaelite painters, he returned to Boston in 1851, and devoted himself to literature and art. He translated [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''Vita Nuova'' (1860 and 1867) and the ''[[Divina Commedia]]'' (1891-91-92, 3 vols, 1902 being the publication year of Norton's thorough final edit). He worked tirelessly as secretary to the [[Loyal Publication Society]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], communicating with newspaper editors across the country, including the journalist [[Jonathan Baxter Harrison]] who became a lifelong friend.&lt;ref&gt;Turner (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; From 1864 to 1868, he edited the highly influential magazine ''[[North American Review]]'', in association with [[James Russell Lowell]]. In 1861 he and Lowell helped [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] in his translation of Dante and in the starting of the informal Dante Club.

==Marriage and family life==
In 1862 Norton married Susan Ridley Sedgwick (21 February 1838 – 17 February 1872), daughter of [[Theodore Sedgwick (writer)|Theodore Sedgwick III]] and Sara Morgan Ashburner.  They were the parents of six children: Eliot (1863), Sarah (1864), Elizabeth (1866), Rupert (1867), Margaret (1870) and Richard (1872).  Susan died at age thirty-three in Dresden, Germany, following the birth of their sixth child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sedgwick.org/na/library/books/sed1961/sed1961-214.html A Sedgwick Genealogy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Turner (historian)|Turner, James]] 1999. "The Liberal Education of Charles Eliot Norton"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept of Western Civilization ==

"Probably only someone with Norton’s experiences and scholarly range – who had written about the Mound Builders, roamed India, organized classical archaeology, scoured medieval archives, published nineteenth-century painting – could have concocted Western Civilization. And only then if he had filtered these materials through the sieve of college teaching during years of curricular anarchy. For Western civilization had a scholarly and pedagogical specificity about it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Travel and friendships ==
From 1855 to 1874 Norton spent much time in travel and residence on the continent of Europe and in England, and it was during this period that his friendships began with [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[John Ruskin]], [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] and [[Leslie Stephen]], an intimacy which did much to bring American and English men of letters into close personal relation. Another friend was [[John Lockwood Kipling]], father of Rudyard Kipling. Father and son visited Norton in Boston and the younger Kipling recalled the visit years later in his autobiography:
{{quote|We visited at Boston [my father's] old friend, Charles Eliot Norton of Harvard, whose daughters I had known at The Grange in my boyhood and since. They were Brahmins of the Boston Brahmins, living delightfully, but Norton himself, full of forebodings as to the future of his land’s soul, felt the established earth sliding under him, as horses feel coming earth-tremors. ... Norton spoke of Emerson and Wendell Holmes and Longfellow and the Alcotts and other influences of the past as we returned to his library, and he browsed aloud among his books; for he was a scholar among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Rudyard Kipling, ''Something of Myself: for my friends known and unknown'', London: MacMillan and Co., 1951 (first published 1937). pp. 127–28&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Norton was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1860.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter N|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterN.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began teaching at Harvard in 1874.&lt;ref name=elfland1990&gt;{{cite book|author= Arthur Efland |title=History of Art Education: Intellectual and Social Currents in Teaching the Visual Arts |year=1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3tyXoFOpPUC&amp;pg=PA64 |publisher= [[Teachers College Press]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8077-7003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, he was appointed professor of the history of art at Harvard, a chair which was created for him and which he held until retirement in 1898. He "centered his teaching upon the golden ages of art history -- classical Athens, the Italian Gothic style of Venetian architecture, and the Florence of the early Renaissance."&lt;ref name=elfland1990 /&gt;

The [[Archaeological Institute of America]] chose him as its first president (1879–1890).

Norton had a peculiar genius for friendship, and it is on his personal influence rather than on his literary productions that his claim to fame rests. In 1881 he inaugurated the Dante Society, whose first presidents were Longfellow, Lowell and Norton himself.  From 1882 onward he confined himself to the study of Dante, his professorial duties, and the editing and publication of the literary memorials of many of his friends.

In 1883 came the ''Letters of Carlyle and Emerson''; in 1886, 1887 and 1888, ''Carlyle's Letters and Reminiscences''; in 1894, the ''Orations and Addresses of [[George William Curtis]]'' and the ''Letters of Lowell''. Norton was also made Ruskin's [[literary executor]], and he wrote various introductions for the American "Brantwood" edition of Ruskin's works. His other publications include ''Notes of Travel and Study in Italy'' (1859), and an ''Historical Study of Church-building in the Middle Ages: Venice, Siena, Florence'' (1880). He organized exhibitions of the drawings of [[J.M.W. Turner|Turner]] (1874) and of Ruskin (1879), for which he compiled the catalogues. In 1886, he opposed the opening of a 'drinking saloon' on the main street near his home, in a letter which reveals little empathy for, or understanding of the significance of, Irish immigration to Cambridge in that era.&lt;ref&gt;For a copy of his letter, see [http://cambridgecivic.com/?p=2805 Cambridge Civic Journal Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; Like his friend Ruskin, Norton believed one of the best things one could do for working-class people was to give them opportunities to gain satisfaction by engaging in [[workmanship]], as opposed to monotonous routine labor where they have to work like machines. [[T. J. Jackson Lears]] has described Norton as the foremost American proponent of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. Norton was a founding member of [[The Society of Arts and Crafts of Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
During the first years of the twentieth century, Norton spoke out in favor of legalized [[euthanasia]]. He lent his name to a movement led by Ohio socialite Anna S. Hall to pass [[physician-assisted suicide]] legislation in [[Ohio]] and [[Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Jacob M. 2004. "A Duty to Kill? A Duty to Die? Rethinking the Euthanasia Controversy of 1906" in Bulletin of the History of Medicine, Volume 78, Number 3&lt;/ref&gt;
Norton died at "Shady Hill," the house where he had been born, on October 21, 1908, and was buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]].

==Legacy==
Norton was widely admired for the breadth of his intellectual interests, remarkable scholarship and interest in the common good.  He was awarded the honorary degrees of Litt.D. (Cambridge) and D.C.L. (Oxford), as well as the L.H.D. from Columbia and the LL.D. from both Harvard and Yale. One of his many students at Harvard was [[James Loeb]], who in 1907 created the "Charles Eliot Norton Memorial Lectureship" in archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeological.org/giving/endowments/244 The Charles Eliot Norton Memorial Lectureship, Archaeological Institute of America]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] are given annually by distinguished professors at Harvard. Norton bequeathed the more valuable portion of his library to Harvard.

The '''Chenouis''' (in [[Berber language|Berber]]: '''Icenwiyen''') are a [[Berbers|Berber]]-speaking population native to [[Algeria]]. They are concentrated in the west-central mountains, and number over 750,000 people.

The traditional area from Fouka ([[Tipaza]] province) until [[Ténès]] ([[Chlef]] province).

==Population==
The Chenoui speaking population is traditionally composed of several tribes: Cenwa ([[Tipaza]]), Guraya (Tipaza), Ayt Mnaser (Beni Menacer) ([[Cherchell]]), Ayt Farah, Arib, Zuzug ([[Ain Defla]]), Ayt Hawa ([[Ténès]]) and the Bissa mounts ([[Chlef]]).

==Berber language==
The Chenoui language which is a Northern Berber language is closely related to the [[Shawiya language]] and Zenata varieties spoken by Berbers of the [[Aures]] mountains in Eastern Algeria and the Rif region.

==Geographical distribution==
[[File:Cherchell Chenoua.jpg|thumb|View of [[Mount Chenoua]].]]
The Chenoui traditional territory includes the province of [[Tipaza]], parts of the [[Chlef Province|Chlef province]] and the north of the province of [[Ain Defla]], and thus are called in reference to the [[Mount Chenoua]] which dominates the city of [[Tipaza]], 70&amp;nbsp;km west of Algiers.

The region is part of the greater [[Dahra]] region, a long mountainous region along the Meditternean coasts, separated from the [[Ouarsenis]] range by the [[Chelif]] river and its valley. It expands from 8&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Mostaganem]] until the Algiers Sahel with its highest point being Mount [[Zaccar]] ([[Miliana]]).

The Chenoua Mount region, highest point of the Algiers Sahel, is the most eastern part of the Chenoui speaking region going from Fouka (42&amp;nbsp;km west of Algiers) until Tenès (200&amp;nbsp;km west of Algiers) or even heading further west till ouled Boughalem in the past. Some people call them the Chelhas of the Tell or even Kabyles of the west.

'''Crime in Portugal''' is combated by the [[Law enforcement in Portugal|Portuguese police]] and other agencies.

== Crime by type ==

===Murder===
{{Further|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}

In 2012, Portugal had a murder rate of 1.2 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; There were a total of 122 murders in Portugal in 2012.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html ''Global Study on Homicide''. [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption ===
{{Main|Corruption in Portugal}}

[[Transparency International]]’s Global Corruption Barometer 2013 reveals that [[Political parties in Portugal|political parties]], [[Parliament of Portugal|Parliament]], the judiciary and [[Portuguese military|the military]] are the most corrupt institutions in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|publisher=Transparency International’s|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organized crime ===

After 1990 crime was a major source of discontent, with a sentiment that Portugal was becoming increasingly unsafe since Portugal became a destination for several thousand emigrants from diverse locations around the globe (in particular from Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Brazil and the former Portuguese territories in Africa - the [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|PALOP]] countries). This led to the dismissal of Internal Administration Minister [[Fernando Gomes (politician)|Fernando Gomes]] (a former mayor of the city of Porto) in the early 2000s on the heels of gang violence that made headlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} Ricardo Dias Felner, "''Com o sindicalismo encaminhado, e Coelho promovido para a pasta do Equipamento, o ministro Fernando Gomes acabaria por ser vítima (para além do caso Barrancos, com calendário ciclicamente previsível) da dramatização de um outro fenómeno determinante no MAI: o aumento da criminalidade, violenta, juvenil e grupal, e do sentimento de insegurança. Ainda que tivesse sido António Guterres, na campanha para as legislativas, que lhe deu a primeira vitória, ao apostar no tema da criminalidade, o problema só ganharia visibilidade e dimensão públicas no seu segundo mandato. Mas por más razões. No Verão de 2000, com os assaltos ao comboio da Linha de Cascais e à actriz Lídia Franco, na CREL, despontava a noção de uma tendência, confirmada pelos relatórios de Segurança Interna e por inquéritos de vitimação, ligada a roubos e agressões de rua. Terá sido fatal a Gomes a inexperiência demonstrada relativamente à investigação criminal: no caso Luanda, por exemplo, o ministro anunciou, nos "media", a captura para breve dos autores do crime, quando a investigação estava sob a alçada da Polícia Judiciária (PJ). Dentro do Governo, alguns colegas não lhe terão perdoado as falhas. Durante o seu mandato ficou ainda definida a nova lei orgânica da PJ, que deu à PSP maiores competências na área da investigação criminal.''" [http://dossiers.publico.clix.pt/noticia.aspx?idCanal=317&amp;id=70281 Administração Interna], [[Público (Portugal)|Público]], 6 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the gang crime wave, which involved large groups of youths wreaking havoc on commuter train lines and robbing gasoline (petrol) stations, Portugal was also shocked by attacks on nightclubs and a rise of violent crime related with local and international organized crime which includes a number of gangs particularly active in [[Greater Lisbon]] and [[Greater Porto]] areas. In addition, with the development and modernization of the [[Economy of Portugal|economy]] within the [[globalization]] process, [[corporate crime]], [[financial crime]], and [[Political corruption|corruption]] are heavily punished and increasingly important issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://q208.wordpress.com/2008/03/29/reportagem-da-al-jazeera-sobre-portugal-um-dos-paises-mais-pobres-e-corruptos-da-europa People &amp; Power, Al Jazeera], [[Al Jazeera]] (March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theft ===
Pickpockets and purse snatchers are present in crowded popular tourist sites, restaurants, or on public transportation in the largest cities, in particular within Lisbon and Porto metropolitan areas. While thieves may operate anywhere, the largest number of reports of theft received by the authorities usually are from the heavily populated areas and major tourist destinations.&lt;ref name= "US dep state"&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1002.html US Department of State, TRAVEL.STATE.GOV - Portugal], [[US Department of State]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== By location ==
Portugal's largest metropolitan areas of [[Lisbon Metropolitan Area|Lisbon]] and [[Porto Metropolitan Area|Porto]] are the main sources of both petty crime and violent crime.&lt;ref name="US dep state"/&gt;

*[[Greater Lisbon]]: Theft is widespread in tourist destinations in the Greater Lisbon area such as the towns of [[Sintra]], [[Cascais]], and [[Mafra, Portugal|Mafra]]. Casal Ventoso, a neighborhood of [[Lisbon]] where drug traffickers and drug users used to gather, was demolished in response to its increasingly unsavory reputation. [[Amadora]] the municipality where Buraca and the feared Cova da Moura neighborhood is located, a stopping point of many of the displaced people of the former Casal Ventoso, and Marvila, a parish in eastern Lisbon municipality, as well as some areas of the municipalities of [[Odivelas]], [[Loures]] and [[Vila Franca de Xira]] around the Portuguese capital, have a higher incidence of crime. Automobile break-ins sometimes occur in parking areas at tourist attractions and near restaurants. There are reports of organized crime and gangs.
*[[Greater Porto]]: There have been reports of theft and violent crime in the area. Some places such as train stations, the Ribeira neighborhood in [[Porto]], as well as some areas of [[Gondomar, Portugal|Gondomar]] and [[Valongo]] municipalities have been especially problematic. There are reports of organized crime and gangs.
*[[Algarve]]: There are few reports of organized crime or gangs, however, as a major centre of international tourism and located in a corner of Europe close to the North of Africa, the region has been noted by the growing number of cases related with [[drug trafficking]]. Pickpockets and other petty criminals exist in moderate numbers. A wave of violent crime targeting wealthy foreign expatriates and tourists residing in the region, was noted since the [[late 2000s economic crisis]], the decreasing economic opportunities for African, East European and South American immigrants and a rise in the number of unemployed Portuguese.
*[[Azores]] (archipelago): Pickpocketing and purse snatching are not common occurrences in the Azores. There are no reports of organized crime or gangs.
*[[Madeira]] (archipelago): Pickpocketing, while infrequent, may occur in some areas of [[Funchal]].

== Crime dynamics ==
The crime rate rose in the 1990s, bringing it to an all-time high during much of this period. It still is low compared to other developed countries and has decreased in the 2000s. [[Violent crime]] rose during the same period and reached record highs.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} "''Portugal surge em terceiro lugar no ranking dos países da União Europeia (UE) onde mais aumentou o número de crimes violentos e de roubos na década de 1995 a 2005.''", Licínio Lima, [https://dn.sapo.pt/2007/11/27/sociedade/crescem_o_roubo_e_crime_violento.html Crescem o roubo e crime violento] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707202024/http://dn.sapo.pt/2007/11/27/sociedade/crescem_o_roubo_e_crime_violento.html |date=7 July 2012 }}, [[Diário de Notícias]] (27 November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policiajudiciaria.pt/htm/dados_estat/dist_global.htm Distribuição da evolução global - Todos os Departamentos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101180011/http://www.policiajudiciaria.pt/htm/dados_estat/dist_global.htm |date=1 January 2008 }}, [[Polícia de Segurança Pública]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The greatest rises were in France, Greece and Portugal (16%),...", [http://www.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/statistics30.htm International Review of Crime Statistics], International Review of Crime Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal's security and peace indicators compare very favourably to other countries. According to the 2017 [[Global Peace Index]] rankings, Portugal is the 3rd most peaceful country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/|title=Vision of Humanity|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
Victims of a crime must report to the nearest police department. The national telephone emergency number is [[1-1-2|112]], which is used in the entire [[European Union]]. The law enforcement system assists the victim to find appropriate medical care, contact family members or friends and explain how further legal procedures could be used.

Although the investigation and prosecution of the crime is the responsibility of local authorities which include main police forces such as the [[Polícia Judiciária]] (criminal investigation police), the [[Polícia de Segurança Pública]] (regular urban police), and the [[Guarda Nacional Republicana]] (gendarmerie), officers can help the victim to understand the criminal justice process and to find an attorney if needed. Portugal has a crime victim's assistance program, administered through an organization known by its acronym, "APAV" (Associação Portuguesa de Apoio à Vítima).&lt;ref name= "US dep state"/&gt;

== Tolerance of drugs ==
{{main|Drug policy of Portugal}}
Portugal has arguably the most liberal laws concerning possession of illicit drugs in the [[Western world]]. In 2001 Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including, but not limited to, [[marijuana]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[LSD]]. While possession is not a crime, trafficking and possession of more than "10 days worth of personal use" are still punishable by jail time and fines.

'''Demographic crisis of Russia''' relates to possible demographic problems of the [[Russian Federation]]. The crisis began to unfold in the beginning of the 1990s.

== History ==
[[File:Population of Russia-rus.PNG|thumb|Total population of Russia 1950-2010]]

=== In the economic sphere === 
  
The demographic crisis has a positive economic effect on the second stage of the changing age structure of the population (the fraction of the average working-age generation is maximal at a relatively small proportion of younger and older) and a negative economic effect on the third stage of the changing age structure of the population (when the proportion of the older generation is maximal at a relatively small share younger and middle generation). By 2025, Russia will have labor shortages.  
  
With a reduced fertility rate, the load on the working population increases because each worker has to support more retirees.
  
The rapid rise in the birth rate in a short period of time is difficult to implement due to economic reasons; sharply increased social spending on the old generation, which in the future will only bring troubles.

=== In education === 
  
The number of high school graduates in Russia has steadily decreased, so universities have to compete for each applicant. Due to the demographic crisis, there is potential for a reduction in the number of universities in the country.

In the coming years, there are plans to lay off 100,000 teachers (one in four) as the number of students decreases by one million each year.{{source needed|date=October 2018}} By 2015, the reduction of the teaching staff will be 20-50%.{{source needed|date=October 2018}}
   
The number of university students in 2013 will amount to 4.2 million, a decrease of more than 40% in relation to the number of students in 2009 (7.4 million).
   
According to the Education Minister Andrei Fursenko, the demographic crisis will help get rid of the high schools that provide poor quality education.
   
=== In the field of defense ===
  
One of the consequences of the demographic crisis is a reduced mobilization potential for the country's armed forces. The demographic crisis affects the nature of the military reform, forcing the military to reduce their numbers, cancel deferments from military service, and eventually move towards hired contractors. As of 2009, the potential mobilization reserve of Russia was 31 million (for comparison, in the United States - 56 million, China - 208 million). In 2010, the organized mobilization reserve was 20 million people. In one possible scenario, the number of 18 year-olds (current mobilization reserve) in 2050 may be reduced by 4 times and could be 328 thousand people.{{source needed|date=October 2018}}

=== In the social sphere === 

Tf. Mr. Professor Antonov AI notes, that the world has tended to strengthen the organization of life without family, to a convenient and unobtrusive solitary bachelor existence, the Stockholm model. And, as a consequence, the number of children in families, which, in turn, leads to a sharp change in the whole system of life, value systems, the weakening of fatherhood and motherhood, unity of parents and children, the disappearance of the roles of brother and sister, disrupt kinship systems.
   
==== Demographic aging of the population ==== 
  
Russia at the end of the 19th century was a country with a young population: the number of children significantly exceeded the number of the elderly. Up to 1938, the population of the Soviet Union remained "demographically young", but later, since 1959, began its demographic aging: the proportion of young age began to decline, and the elderly - to increase, which was the result of lower fertility. This was not unique to Russia, and such issues have been felt in many developed countries. In 1990, Russia ranked 25th in the list of countries with high rates of population aging. Currently, the share of people aged 65 and older in the population of Russia is 13%. According to forecasts of the Russian Academy of Sciences from the early 2000's,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} in 2016 elderly people aged over 60 would have accounted for 20% of Russians, and children up to 15 years would only have made up 17%. However in Russia, in contrast to other countries, aging is being limited by high mortality among older people.

=== Threats === 
  
A number of researchers believe that the depopulation affected the Russian people to a greater extent than other peoples living in Russia. According to Rybakovskii, the real (and not the census) number of Russians for the period from 1989 to 2002 decreased by 7%, while the overall country population - only by 1.3%. According to Beloborodov, by the year 2025 85-90% of the population decline in Russia will be due to Russians and in the course of the next 20 years the percentage of Russians as a rough estimate will drop to about 60 to 70%. He predicts also that in 2050, the proportion of Russians in Russia will amount to 46.5%. Some researchers, considering the reduction of the indigenous population as a result of the demographic crisis, given accompanying high immigration (in the case of lack of assimilation of migrants), have made very alarming forecasts. As one of the likely consequences of the demographic crisis some researchers point to a deep change in the future ethno-religious composition of the population (with a share of more than 20% of migrants appear closed ethnic groups, assimilation difficult and exacerbated ethnic conflicts). By 2030, one in five people of Russia will practice Islam. A graphic example of ethnic aspect of the demographic crisis: now a third of all the births in Moscow accounts for migrants, which would change the ethnic and religious composition of the population of Moscow in the nearest future. Reduction of the indigenous population by increasing the share of migrants in the opinion of some researchers may lead to future loss of the territorial integrity of Russia. Chances are that the first territorial losses will be in Siberia and Russian Far East. This is due both to the depopulation of these lands because of low birth rates and internal migration to the European part of Russia, and to the demographic pressure from Asian countries (especially China). For the first time in the history of Russian Siberia, its population is steadily declining.

==Ethnic groups==
The largest ethnic group are [[Dhivehis]], native to the historic region of the [[Maldive Islands]] comprising today's Republic of Maldives and the island of [[Minicoy]] in [[Lakshadweep|Union territory of Lakshadweep]], [[India]]. They share the same culture and speak the [[Dhivehi language]]. They are principally an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] people, closely related to the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and having traces of [[Middle East]]ern, [[South Asia]]n, [[Austronesia]]n and [[Africa]]n genes in the population.

In the past there was also a small Tamil population known as the [[Giraavaru people]]. This group have now been almost completely absorbed into the larger Maldivian society but were once native to the island of [[Giraavaru (Kaafu Atoll)]]. This island was evacuated in 1968 due to heavy erosion of the island.

==Languages==
{{Main article|Languages of Maldives}}
[[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]],  an Indo-Aryan language having some similarities with Elu, the ancient Sinhalese language and written in a specialized Arabic script ([[Tāna]]), is the official language and is spoken by virtually the whole population. [[English language|English]] is also spoken as a second language by many.

==Religion==
{{see also|Islam in the Maldives|Buddhism in the Maldives|Freedom of religion in the Maldives}}
[[Sunni Islam]] is the state religion. Historically, the Maldives were converted to Islam from Buddhism in the 12th century. 
Under the 1997 constitution, [[Freedom of religion in the Maldives|freedom of religion]] is limited, Islam being the only religion accepted in public. Consequently, the vast majority of population professes adherence to Islam, reported as 98.4% as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/maldives#/?affiliations_religion_id=0&amp;affiliations_year=2010&amp;region_name=All%20Countries&amp;restrictions_year=2013 Maldives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522204137/http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/maldives |date=22 May 2016 }}. globalreligiousfutures.org&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Royal and noble ranks}}
A '''duke''' (male) or '''duchess''' (female) can either be a monarch ruling over a [[duchy]] or a member of royalty or [[nobility]], historically of highest rank below the [[monarch]]. The title comes from French ''duc'', itself from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[dux]]'', 'leader', a term used in [[Roman Republic|republican Rome]] to refer to a military commander without an official rank (particularly one of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] or [[Celts|Celtic]] origin), and later coming to mean the leading military commander of a province.

The title [[dux]] survived in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] where it was used in several contexts signifying a rank equivalent to a captain or general. Later on, in the 11th century, the title [[Megas Doux]] was introduced for the post of commander-in-chief of the entire navy.

During the [[Middle Ages]] the title (as ''[[Herzog]]'') signified first among the [[Germanic monarchy|Germanic monarchies]]. Dukes were the rulers of the provinces and the superiors of the [[count]]s in the cities and later, in the [[feudal monarchies]], the highest-ranking peers of the king. A duke may or may not be, ''ipso facto'', a member of the nation's [[peerage]]: in the United Kingdom and Spain all dukes are/were also peers of the realm, in France some were and some were not, while the term is not applicable to dukedoms of other nations, even where an institution similar to the peerage (e.g., [[Grandee]]ship, [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], [[Upper nobility (Kingdom of Hungary)|Hungarian House of Magnates]]) existed.

During the 19th century many of the smaller German and Italian states were ruled by Dukes or [[Grand Duke]]s. But at present, with the exception of the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]], there are no dukes ruling as monarchs. Duke remains the highest hereditary title (aside from titles borne by the [[reign]]ing or [[abolished monarchy|formerly reigning]] dynasty) in Portugal (though now a republic), Spain, and the United Kingdom. In Sweden, members of the Royal Family are given a personal dukedom at birth. The Pope, as a temporal sovereign, has also, though rarely, granted the title of Duke or Duchess to persons for "services" to the [[Holy See]]. In some realms the relative status of "duke" and "prince", as titles borne by the [[nobility]] rather than by members of reigning dynasties, varied—e.g., in Italy and the Netherlands.

A woman who holds in her own right the title to such duchy or dukedom, or is the wife of a duke, is normally styled '''duchess'''. [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], however, is known by tradition as [[Dukes of Normandy|Duke of Normandy]] in the [[Channel Islands]] and [[Duke of Lancaster]] in [[Lancashire]].

== Duchy and dukedom ==
{{main|Duchy}}
A duchy is the territory or geopolitical entity ruled by a duke, whereas his title or area is often called a dukedom. The [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] is a fully independent state and its head, the Grand Duke, is a sovereign monarch reigning over his Luxembourgish subjects. 

The [[Duke of Cornwall]] holds both the dukedom (title) and duchy (estate holdings), the latter being the source of his personal income; those living on the ducal estates are subjects of the British sovereign and owe neither fealty nor services to the duke ''per se''.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} In Scotland the male heir apparent to the British crown is always the [[Duke of Rothesay]] as well, but this is a dukedom (title) without a duchy. Similarly, the British monarch rules and owns the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] as [[Duke of Lancaster]], but it is held separately from the Crown, with the income of the duchy estates providing the Sovereign's [[Privy Purse]]. 

The Channel Islands are two of the three remaining Crown Dependencies, the last vestiges of the lands of the Duchy of Normandy. The Islanders in their loyal toast will say "La Reine, notre Duc" (The Queen, Our Duke). Though the title was apparently renounced under the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1259, the Crown still maintains that the title is retained: "In 1106, William's youngest son Henry I seized the Duchy of Normandy from his brother Robert; since that time, the English Sovereign has always held the title [[Duke of Normandy]]," and that "By 1205, England had lost most of its French lands, including Normandy. However, the Channel Islands, part of the lost Duchy, remained a self-governing possession of the English Crown. While the islands today retain autonomy in government, they owe allegiance to The Queen in her role as Duke of Normandy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandCrowndependencies/ChannelIslands.aspx|title=Channel Islands|last=|first=|date=2009|website=The Official Website of the British Monarchy|publisher=The Royal Household|accessdate=August 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921052748/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandCrowndependencies/ChannelIslands.aspx|archivedate=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle Ages ==
During the [[Middle Ages]], after Roman power in Western Europe collapsed, the title was still employed in the Germanic kingdoms, usually to refer to the rulers of old Roman provinces.

=== Albania ===
In 1332, [[Robert of Taranto]] succeeded his father, [[Philip I of Taranto|Philip]]. Robert's uncle, [[John, Duke of Durazzo|John]], did not wish to do him homage for the [[Principality of Achaea]], so Robert received Achaea from John in exchange for 5,000&amp;nbsp;ounces of gold and the rights to the diminished [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]]. John took the style of [[Duke of Durazzo]] (today [[Durrës]]).

In 1368, Durazzo fell to [[Karl Thopia]], who was recognized by [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] as ''Prince of Albania''.

=== Visigoths ===
The [[Visigoths]] retained the Roman divisions of their kingdom in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and it seems that dukes ruled over these areas.{{citation needed|date=June 2008}} They were the most powerful landowners and, along with the bishops, elected the king, usually from their own midst. They were the military commanders and in this capacity often acted independently from the king, most notably in the latter period before the Muslim invasions.

The army was structured decimally with the highest unit, the [[thiufa]], probably corresponding to about 1,000 people from each ''civitas'' (city district). The cities were commanded by counts, who were in turn answerable to the dukes, who called up the ''thiufae'' when necessary.

=== Lombards ===
{{main article|Duke (Lombard)}}
When the [[Lombards]] entered Italy, the Latin chroniclers called their war leaders ''duces'' in the old fashion. These leaders eventually became the provincial rulers, each with a recognized seat of government. Though nominally loyal to the king, the concept of kingship was new to the Lombards and the dukes were highly independent, especially in central and southern Italy, where the [[Duke of Spoleto]] and the [[Duke of Benevento]] were ''de facto'' sovereigns. In 575, when [[Cleph]] died, a period known as the [[Rule of the Dukes]], in which the dukes governed without a king, commenced. It lasted only a decade before the disunited magnates, in order to defend the kingdom from external attacks, elected a new king and even diminished their own duchies to provide him with a handsome royal [[demesne]].

The Lombard kings were usually drawn from the duke pool when the title was not hereditary. The dukes tried to make their own offices hereditary. Beneath them in the internal structure were the counts and [[gastald]]s, a uniquely Lombard title initially referring to judicial functions, similar to a count's, in provincial regions

=== Franks ===
The Franks employed dukes as the governors of Roman provinces, though they also led military expeditions far from their duchies. The dukes were the highest-ranking officials in the realm, typically Frankish (whereas the counts were often Gallo-Roman), and formed the class from which the kings' generals were chosen in times of war. The dukes met with the king every May to discuss policy for the upcoming year, the so-called [[May field|Mayfield]].

In [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] and [[Provence]], the titles of [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] and [[prefect]] were commonly employed instead of duke, probably for historical reasons relating to the greater Romanization of those provinces. But the titles were basically equivalent.

In late [[Merovingian]] Gaul, the [[mayors of the palace]] of the [[Arnulfing]] clan began to use the title [[Duke of the Franks|''dux et princeps Francorum'']]: "duke and prince of the Franks". In this title, "duke" implied supreme military control of the entire nation (''Francorum'', the Franks) and it was thus used until the end of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty in France in 987.

=== Holy Roman Empire ===

==== Stem duchies ==== 
The stem duchies were the constituent duchies of the kingdom of Germany at the time of the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty (the death of Louis the Child in 911) and the transitional period leading to the formation of the Holy Roman Empire later in the 10th century.

{{Peerage |Ranks}}

==== Anglo-Saxon times ====
In Anglo-Saxon England, where the Roman political divisions were largely abandoned, the highest political rank beneath that of king was [[ealdorman]], and the first ealdormen were referred to as ''duces'' (the plural of the original Latin ''dux'') in the chronicles. The title ealdorman was replaced by the [[Danish language|Danish]] ''eorl'' (later [[earl]]) over time. After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], their power and regional jurisdiction was limited to that of the Norman [[count]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Normans: The History of a Dynasty|last=Crouch|first=David|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|year=2002|isbn=978-1852855956|location=|pages=108|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Late medieval times ====
[[Edward III of England]] created the first English dukedom by naming his eldest son [[Edward, the Black Prince]], as [[Duke of Cornwall]] in 1337, after he lost his own title of [[Duke of Normandy]]. Upon the death of the Black Prince, the duchy of Cornwall passed to his nine-year-old son, who would eventually succeed his grandfather as [[Richard II of England|Richard II]].

The title of [[Duke of Lancaster]] was created by Edward III in 1351 for [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Henry of Grosmont]], but became extinct upon the duke's death in 1361. The following year, Edward III bestowed the title (2nd creation) on his fourth son, [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], who was also married to the first duke's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Duke of Lancaster|see Dukes of Lancaster]]&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day Edward III also created his second son, [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp]], as [[Duke of Clarence]].

All five of Edward III's surviving sons eventually became dukes. In 1385, ten years after their father's death, his heir Richard II created dukedoms for his last two uncles on the same day. [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas of Woodstock]] was named [[Duke of Gloucester]] and [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Edmund of Langley]] became [[Duke of York]], thereby founding the [[House of York]], which later fought for the throne with John of Gaunt's [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] descendants during the [[Wars of the Roses]].

By 1483, a total of 16 ducal titles had been created: Cornwall, Lancaster, Clarence, Gloucester, York, [[Duke of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Duke of Hereford|Hereford]], [[Duke of Aumale|Aumale]], [[Duke of Exeter|Exeter]], [[Duke of Surrey|Surrey]], [[Duke of Norfolk|Norfolk]], [[Duke of Bedford|Bedford]], [[Duke of Somerset|Somerset]], [[Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]], [[Duke of Warwick|Warwick]] and [[Duke of Suffolk|Suffolk]]. Some became extinct, others had multiple creations, and some had merged with the crown upon the holder's accession to the throne. When the [[Plantagenet]] dynasty came to an end at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] on 22 August 1485, only four ducal titles remained extant, of which two were now permanently associated with the crown. [[John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk|John de la Pole]] was Duke of Suffolk and [[John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk|John Howard]] was Duke of Norfolk (2nd creation), while the duchy of Cornwall was reserved as a title and source of income for the eldest son of the sovereign, and the duchy of Lancaster was now held by the monarch.

Norfolk perished alongside [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] at Bosworth field, and the title was forfeit. It was restored to his son [[Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk|Thomas]] thirty years later by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], as one of a number of dukes created or recreated by the [[Tudor dynasty]] over the ensuing century. England's premier ducal title, Norfolk, remains in the Howard family to this day.

== The modern age ==
[[File:Coronet of a British Duke.svg|thumb|right|A Duke's [[coronet]] ([[United Kingdom]]), as used in [[heraldry]]]]
In the 19th century, the sovereign dukes of [[Parma, Italy|Parma]] and [[Modena]] in Italy, and of [[Anhalt]], [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]], [[Nassau (state)|Nassau]], [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], [[Saxe-Meiningen]] and [[Saxe-Altenburg]] in Germany survived Napoleon's reorganization.

Since the unification of Italy in 1870 and the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918, there have no longer been any [[reign]]ing dukes in Europe; [[Luxembourg]] is ruled by a [[Grand Duchy|grand duke]], a higher title, just below king.

In the United Kingdom, the inherited position of a duke along with its dignities, privileges, and rights is a [[List of dukedoms in the peerages of the British Isles|dukedom]]. However, the title of ''duke'' has never been associated with independent rule in the British Isles: they hold dukedoms, not duchies (excepting the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] and the [[Duchy of Lancaster]]). Dukes in the United Kingdom are addressed as "Your Grace" and referred to as "His Grace". Currently, there are thirty-five dukedoms in the [[Peerage of England]], [[Peerage of Scotland]], [[Peerage of Great Britain]], [[Peerage of Ireland]] and [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]], held by thirty different people, as three people hold two dukedoms and [[Duke of Richmond and Lennox|one holds three]] (see [[List of dukes in the peerages of Britain and Ireland]]).

== Equivalents in other European languages ==
See [[wikt:en:duke]] for equivalents in other European languages.

== Royal dukes ==
{{redirect|Royal duke|the South Korean car|Daewoo Royale Duke}}
Various royal houses traditionally awarded (mainly) dukedoms to the sons and in some cases, the daughters, of their respective sovereigns; others include at least one dukedom in a wider list of similarly granted titles, nominal dukedoms without any actual authority, often even without an estate. Such titles are still conferred on royal princes or princesses in the current European monarchies of Belgium, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

Other historical cases occurred for example in Denmark, Finland (as a part of Sweden) and France, Portugal and some former colonial possessions such as Brazil and Haiti.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{main article|Royal dukedoms in the United Kingdom|List of dukes in the peerages of Britain and Ireland}}

In the United Kingdom, ducal titles which have been given within the royal family include [[Duke of Cornwall]], [[Duke of Lancaster]], [[Duke of Clarence]], [[Duke of York]], [[Duke of Gloucester]], [[Duke of Bedford]], [[Duke of Cumberland]], [[Duke of Cambridge]], [[Duke of Rothesay]], [[Duke of Albany]], [[Duke of Ross]], [[Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Duke of Kent]], [[Duke of Sussex]], and [[Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]]. 

Following his [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication]] in 1936 the former [[King Edward VIII]] was given the title [[Duke of Windsor]].

=== Belgium ===
In [[Belgium]], the title of [[Duke of Brabant]] (historically the most prestigious in the [[Low Countries]], and containing the federal capital [[Brussels]]), if still vacant, has been awarded preferentially to the eldest son and [[heir apparent]] of the king, other male dynasts receiving various lower historical titles (much older than Belgium, and in principle never fallen to the Belgian crown), such as Count of Flanders ([[King Leopold III]]'s so-titled brother [[Prince Charles, Count of Flanders|Charles]] held the title when he became the realm's temporary head of state as [[prince-regent]]) and Prince of Liège (a secularised version of the historical [[prince-bishop]]ric; e.g. [[Albert II of Belgium|King Albert II]] until he succeeded his older brother [[Baudouin I]]).

=== Denmark ===
Denmark's kings gave appanages in their twin-duchies of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] (now three-fourths of them is part of Germany, but then the Holstein half of it was part of the Holy Roman Empire in personal union with Denmark proper) to younger sons or their male-line descendants, with a specific though not sovereign title of Duke, e.g., [[Duke of Gottorp]], [[Duke of Sonderburg]], [[Duke of Augustenborg]], [[Duke of Franzhagen]], [[Duke of Beck]], [[Duke of Glucksburg]] and [[Duke of Norburg]].

=== Iberian peninsula ===
When the [[Christian]] [[Reconquista]], sweeping the [[Moors]] from the former [[Caliph of Cordoba|Caliphate of Córdoba]] and its [[Taifa|taifa-remnants]], transformed the territory of former [[Suebi|Suevic]] and [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] realms into [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Feudalism|feudal]] principalities, none of these warlords was exactly styled Duke. A few (as Portugal [[County of Portugal|itself]]) started as [[Count]] (even if the title of [[Dux]] was sometimes added), but soon all politically relevant princes were to use the royal style of [[Monarch|King]].

==== Portugal ====
{{main article|List of dukedoms in Portugal}}

In Portugal, the title of Duke was granted for the first time in 1415 to [[Pedro, Duke of Coimbra|infante Peter]] and [[Henry the Navigator|infante Henry]], the second and third sons of king [[John I of Portugal|John I]], following their participation in the successful [[Conquest of Ceuta]]. Pedro became the first [[Duke of Coimbra]] and Henry the first [[Duke of Viseu]].

From the reign of king [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]], the title of [[Duke of Beja]] was given to the second son of the monarch. This was changed during the Liberal regime in the 19th century (with [[Maria II of Portugal|queen Maria II]]), when the first infante (second son of the monarch) got the title of [[Duke of Porto]] and the second infante (third son) was known as Duke of Beja.

There are examples of Duke as a subsidiary title, granted to the most powerful noble Houses:
* [[Duke of Barcelos]], to be used by the heir of the [[Duke of Braganza]];
* [[Duke of Torres Novas]], to be used by the heir of the [[Duke of Aveiro]];
* [[Duke of Miranda do Corvo]], to be used by the heir of the [[Duke of Lafões]].

Usually, the title of Duke was granted to relatives of the Royal Family, such as the [[infante]]s or natural sons of the monarch. There are exceptions, such as [[António José de Ávila, 1st Duke of Ávila and Bolama|António José de Ávila]], who, although not having any relation to the royal family, was given the title of [[duke of Ávila and Bolama]] in the 19th Century.

==== Spain ====
{{main article|List of dukedoms in Spain}}
Spanish [[infante]]s and [[infanta]]s were usually given a dukedom upon marriage, excepting the heir apparent who is the [[Prince of Asturias]]. This title is nowadays not hereditary but carries a [[Grandeza de España]]. The current royal duchesses are: [[Infanta Doña Pilar de Borbón|HRH the Duchess of Badajoz]] (Infanta Maria del Pilar), [[Infanta Doña Margarita de Borbón|HRH the Duchess of Soria]] (Infanta Margarita) (although she inherited the title of Duchess of Hernani from her cousin and is second holder of that title), and [[Infanta Elena of Spain|HRH the Duchess of Lugo]] (Infanta Elena).
In Spain all the dukes hold the court rank of ''Grande'', i.e., [[Grandee]] of the realm, which had precedence over all other [[feudatories]].

=== Nordic countries ===
{{more information|Duchies in Sweden}}

The Northern European duchies of [[Halland]], [[Jutland]], [[Lolland]], [[Osilia]] and [[Reval]] existed in the Middle Ages. The longest-surviving duchy was [[Schleswig]], i.e., ''Sonderjylland'' (a portion of which later became part of Germany). Its southern neighbor, the duchy of [[Holstein]], in personal union with the Danish crown, was nonetheless always a German principality. The two duchies jointly became a member of the German [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] as "[[Schleswig-Holstein]]" in the 19th century.

In [[Sweden]], medieval duchies of [[Finland]], [[Södermanland]], [[Skåne]], and [[Halland]] were some appanages for princes of the reigning dynasty. In modern times almost every province in Sweden was used as the [[territorial designation]] for a royal prince's dukedom.

Sweden had a history of making the sons of its kings ruling princes of vast [[duchy|duchies]], but this ceased in 1622. Only one non-royal person was ever given a dukedom. In 1772, King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] reinstated the appointment of dukes but as a non-hereditary title for his brothers. Since then, all Swedish princes have been created dukes of a province at birth. When the [[Act of Succession (1810)|1810 Act of Succession]] was amended to allow female succession to the throne, King [[Carl XVI Gustaf]]'s eldest daughter [[Crown Princess Victoria|Victoria]] became Crown Princess (displacing her younger brother [[Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland|Carl Philip]]) and received the title of Duchess of Västergötland. The practice of conferring ducal titles has since extended to Swedish princesses as well as princes. Currently, there are five dukes and four duchesses in their own right. The territorial designations of these dukedoms refer to ten of the [[Provinces of Sweden]].

Key parts of Finland were sometimes under a [[Duke of Finland]] during the Swedish reign. Some of the provinces are still considered duchies for the purposes of heraldry.

=== France and other former monarchies ===
See [[appanage]] (mainly for the French kingdom) and the list in the geographical section below, which also treats special ducal titles in orders or national significance.

== France ==
{{main article|Dukes in France}}

The highest precedence in the realm, attached to a feudal territory, was given to the twelve original [[pairie]]s (en: ''peers''), which also had a traditional function in the royal coronation, comparable to the German imperial archoffices. Half of them were ducal: three ecclesiastical (the six prelates all ranked above the six secular peers of the realm) and three temporal, each time above three counts of the same social estate:
The ''[[Prince-Bishop]]s'' with ducal territories among them were:
* The [[Archbishop of Reims]], styled ''archevêque-duc pair de France'' (in Champagne; who crowns and anoints the king, traditionally in his cathedral)
* Two [[suffragan bishop]]s, styled ''evêque-duc pair de France'' :
** the bishop-duke of [[Laon]] (in Picardy; bears the 'Sainte Ampoule' containing the sacred ointment)
** the bishop-duc de [[Langres]] (in Burgundy; bears the scepter)
Later, the [[Archbishop of Paris]] was given the title of ''[[duc de Saint-Cloud]]'' with the dignity of peerage, but it was debated if he was an ecclesiastical peer or merely a bishop holding a lay peerage.

The secular dukes in the peerage of the realm were, again in order of precedence:
* The [[Duke of Burgundy]] or duc de Bourgogne (known as ''Grand duc''; not a separate title at that time; just a description of the wealth and real clout of the 15th century Dukes, cousins of the Kings of France) (bears the crown, fastens the belt)
* The [[Duke of Normandy]] or duc de Normandie (holds the first square banner)
* The [[Duke of Aquitaine]] or duc d'Aquitaine or de Guyenne (holds the second square banner)

The theory of the participation of the peers in the coronation was laid down in the late 13th century, when some of the peerage (the Duchy of Normandy and the County of Toulouse) had already been merged in the crown.

At the end of this same century, the king elevated some counties into duchies, a practice that increased up until the Revolution. Many of this duchies were also peerages (the so-called 'new peerages').

== Italy, Germany and Austria ==
{{main article|Dukes in Italy, Germany and Austria}}

In Italy, Germany and Austria the title of "duke" (''duca'' in Italian, and ''Herzog'' in German) was quite common. As the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]] (HRE) was until its dissolution a feudal structure, most of its Dukes were actually reigning in their lands. As the titles from the HRE were taken over after its dissolution, or in Italy after their territories became independent of the Empire, both countries also had a share of fully sovereign dukes. Also, in Germany in many ducal families every agnate would bear the ducal title of the family as a [[courtesy title]].

In Italy some important sovereign ducal families were the [[house of Visconti|Visconti]] and the [[Sforza]], who ruled [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]]; the Savoia in Piedmont; the [[Medici]] of [[Florence]]; the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] of [[Duchy of Parma|Parma and Piacenza]]; the [[Cybo|Cybo-Malaspina]] of [[Massa]]; the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] of [[Duchy of Mantua|Mantua]]; the [[House of Este|Este]] of [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio|Modena]] and [[Duchy of Ferrara|Ferrara]]. The maritime republics of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] were ruled by elected [[Doge]]s, a word which comes from the same Latin root as "Duke".

In Germany, important ducal families were the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbachs]] in [[Bavaria]], the [[Welfs]] in [[Electorate of Hanover|Hannover]], the ducal family of [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]], the [[House of Wettin|Wettins]] in [[Saxony]] (with its [[Ernestine duchies|Ernestine branch]] divided into several duchies), the [[List of rulers of Württemberg|Württembergs]], the [[House of Mecklenburg|Mecklenburgs]] and the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] in [[Austria]] as "Archdukes". In the German Confederation the [[House of Nassau|Nassaus]], the [[House of Ascania|Ascanians]] of [[Anhalt]], the Welf branch of [[Duchy of Brunswick|Brunswick]] and the Ernestine lines of the Saxon duchies were the sovereign ducal families.

== Elsewhere in Europe ==

=== Hungary ===
In the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] no ducal principalities existed but duchies were often formed for members of the dynasty as [[appanage]]s. During the rule of the [[Arpads|Árpád dynasty]] dukes held territorial powers, some of them even minted coins, but later this title became more often nominal.
These duchies usually were
* the Duchy of Nitra
* the Duchy of Bihar
* the Duchy of [[Transylvania]] (consisting of the [[voivodship]] of Transylvania and some other counties)

In the Jagellonian era (1490–1526) only two dukes did not belong to the royal dynasty: [[John Corvin]] (the illegitimate son of [[Matthias Corvinus]]) and [[Lőrinc Újlaki]] (whose father was the king of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]), and both bore the title as royal dukes.

After the [[Battle of Mohács]] the Habsburg kings rewarded Hungarian aristocrats (like the [[House of Esterházy|Esterházys]]) with princely titles, but they created these titles as Holy Roman Emperors, not as kings of Hungary.

=== Greece ===
As the Catholic crusaders overran Orthodox Christian parts of the Byzantine empire, they installed several [[crusader state]]s (see [[Frangokratia]]), some of which were of ducal rank:
* the [[Duchy of Athens]], to which the [[duchy of Neopatras]] was later linked
* the Aegean insular [[Duchy of Naxos]], officially the "Duchy of the Archipelago"

The Byzantines retained the title ''dux'', transcribed as ''doux'' in Greek. As in the later Roman Empire, it remained a military office. In the 10th century, it was given to the military commanders over several ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|themata]]'' (also known as ''[[katepano]]''), and in the late 11th century it became used for the governor of a ''thema''.

In Italy and other western countries, the later Byzantine [[appanage]]s of the [[Palaiologan period]] were sometimes translated as duchies: the [[Despotate of the Morea|Morea]], Mesembria, [[Selymbria]] and [[Thessaloniki]]. However, as these had Greek holders, they were titled ''[[Archon]]'' ("magistrate") or ''[[Despotes]]''.

In the independent [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]], the style of [[Duke of Sparta]] was instituted in 1868 upon the birth of [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] as a distinct title for the crown prince of Greece.

=== Slavic and nearby countries ===
Generally, confusion reigns whether to translate the usual ruler titles, ''knyaz/ knez/ ksiaze'' etc. as Prince (analogous to the German Fürst) or as Duke;
* In splintered [[Poland]] petty principalities generally ruled by branches of the earlier Polish [[Piast dynasty]] are regarded as duchies in translated titulary. Examples of such: [[Kujavia]], [[Masovia]], [[Sandomierz|Sandomir]], [[Greater Poland]] and [[Kalisz]] as well as various minor duchies, often short-lived or in personal union or merger, named after their capitals, mainly in the regions known as [[Lesser Poland|Little Poland]] and [[Greater Poland]], including (there are often also important Latin or German forms) [[Kraków]], [[Łęczyca]] and [[Sieradz]].
* In [[Pomerelia]] and [[Pomerania]] (inhabited by the Kashubians, different Slavic people from the Poles proper), branches of native ruling dynasties were usually recognized as dukes, quite similarly to the pattern in Poland.
* In Russia, before the imperial unification from [[Muscovy]]; sometimes even as vassal, tributary to a Tartar [[Khan (title)|Khan]]; later, in Peter the Great's autocratic empire, the russification '''gertsog''' was used as the Russian rendering of the German ducal title ''Herzog'', especially as (the last) part of the full official style of the Russian Emperor: ''Gertsog Shlesvig-Golstinskiy, Stormarnskiy, Ditmarsenskiy i Oldenburgskiy i prochaya, i prochaya, i prochaya'' "Duke of Schleswig-Holstein [see above], [[Stormarn (gau)|Stormarn]], [[Dithmarschen]] and [[Oldenburg]], and of other lands", in chief of German and Danish territories to which the Tsar was dynastically linked.
* In Bohemia was [[Duchy of Krumlov]], and short-lived [[Napoleon II of France|Duchy of Reichstadt]] and [[Duchy of Friedland]].
* In [[Silesia]] were many petty duchies as [[Duchy of Brzeg]], [[Duchy of Legnica]], [[Duchy of Zator]] and [[Duchy of Racibórz]]. They were vassals of [[List of rulers of Bohemia|King of Bohemia]].
*In [[Lithuania]], the approximate equivalent of a duke or prince was called ''kunigaikštis'' in the Lithuanian language.  Latin translation was ''dux'' meaning "duke" in the Middle Ages, whereas Latin for "prince" is ''princeps''.  The overall leader of the Lithuanian dukes ([[Lithuanian language|Lith.]] plural: ''kunigaikščiai'') was the [[grand duke]] ([[Lithuanian language|Lith.]]: ''didysis kunigaikštis'', [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''magnus dux''), who acted as the [[monarch]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] until 1795 when Russians took over the land.

=== Netherlands ===
After Belgium and the Netherlands separated in 1830, the title of duke no longer existed in the Netherlands. There is, however, one exception; the title ''Hertog van Limburg'' (''Duke of Limburg'') still exists. This title, however, is an exclusive title for the head of state (the monarch, i.e., the king or queen of the Netherlands).

== Post-colonial non-European states ==

=== Empire of Brazil ===
In the [[Empire of Brazil]] duke was the highest rank for people born outside the imperial house and only three dukedoms were created. Two of these titles were for relatives of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro I]]: an illegitimate daughter and a [[Auguste de Beauharnais, 2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg|brother-in-law]] who received the title when married to Pedro I's daughter [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]. The third, given to [[Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, Duke of Caxias|Luís Alves de Lima e Silva]], was the only dukedom created during the reign of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]]. None of these titles were hereditary, just like every other title in the Brazilian nobility system.

=== Haiti ===
The royal [[Henri Christophe|Christophe]] dynasty created eight hereditary dukedoms, in rank directly below the nominal princes. They were short-lived and only recognised in the country.

== Equivalents ==
{{main article|Equivalents of Duke outside Europe|Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles}}
Like other major Western noble titles, Duke is sometimes used to render (translate) certain titles in non-western languages. "Duke" is used even though those titles are generally etymologically and often historically unrelated and thus hard to compare. However, they are considered roughly equivalent, especially in hierarchic aristocracies such as feudal Japan, useful as an indication of relative rank.

=== India ===
Indian feudal system cannot be fully translated to its European counterparts. The closest equivalent to the title of Sovereign Duke is [[Rao (title)|Rao]] and to a feudal [[duchy]], a large [[jagir]]. Thus, a Rao (in the ruling system) or a Jagirdar, Deshmukh, Patil and Zamindar (in a feudal way) are closely equivalent to a Duke.

=== Turkey, Afghanistan and Iran ===
Duke in Turkey, Afghanistan and Iran after Mongolian war against them, was added as generals and kings of districts or states but in the Kingdom of Persians and Ottomans, the systems cannot be fully translated to its European counterparts so they called those generals and kings as [[Khan (title)|Khan]], a Mongolian royal and noble rank from the Turco-Mongol word for "lord," equal to Duke. After, revolutions and falling Empire system in those countries(changing the ruling system to democratic and republic systems), those Khans and the other equal ranks titles added to the titleholder's surnames and the ranking system as usual was disqualified as an official ranking.

=== China ===
During the era of [[feudalism]] in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]] ([[Western Zhou]], [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the [[Warring States period]]), the title of ''gōng'' ([[wikt:公|公]], conventionally translated as "Duke") was sparingly granted.  In a tradition called "Three Deferences and Two Royal Descendants" (三恪二王後), the three former royal houses were granted the title of Duke.  For the Zhou dynasty, this would be the descendants of the [[Xia Dynasty]] and [[Shang Dynasty]]; their dukedoms were respectively the states of Qi (杞) and Song (宋).  When the rulers of these states called at the Zhou court, the king greeted them as equals, out of deference of their former status as royalty.

Noble titles also existed in subsequent periods.

The [[Duke of Yansheng]] noble title was granted to the descendants of [[Confucius]]. In 1935, the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] Government changed the title to Sacrificial Official to Confucius (大成至聖先師奉祀官), which still exists as an office of the [[Republic of China]], de facto hereditary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Duke Yansheng]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dukedoms and other lesser titles were also awarded, sometimes posthumously (see [[posthumous names]]), during the imperial period of [[Chinese history]] to recognize distinguished civil and military officials. For example, [[Emperor Lizong of Song]] granted the posthumous title Duke of Hui (徽国公) to the [[Neo-Confucian]] thinker [[Zhu Xi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chu Hsi New Studies|last=Chan|first=Wing-tsit|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-8248-1201-0|location=|pages=34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
The Javanese kingdom of [[Majapahit]], which dominated eastern Java in the 14th and 15th centuries, was divided into ''nagara'' (provinces). The administration of these ''nagara'' was entrusted to members of the royal family, who bore the title of ''Bhre''—i.e., ''Bhra i'', "lord of" (the word ''bhra'' being akin to the [[Thai language|Thai]] ''[[Phra]]''), followed by the name of the land they were entrusted with: for example a sister of king [[Hayam Wuruk]] (r. 1350–1389) was "Bhre Lasem", "lady of [[Lasem]]". This system was similar to the [[Apanage]] system in Western Europe.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

[[Sultan Agung]], king of [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] in [[Central Java]] (r. 1613–1645), would entrust the administration of territories he gradually conquered all over the island of Java, to officials bearing the title of ''Adipati'', this title is hereditary. Such territories were called ''Kadipaten''. Prior to the unification of Java by Sultan Agung, independent ''kadipaten''s also exist, e.g. the [[Duchy of Surabaya]] which was [[Mataram conquest of Surabaya|conquered]] by Agung in 1625.

The [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] (Dutch East Indies Company), while gradually taking control of Javanese territory, would maintain the existing Mataram administrative structure. ''Adipati'' were called "''[[regent]]en''" in Dutch,{{cn|date=January 2017}} and the territories they administered, "''[[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|regentschappen]]''".

In the 19th century, the Javanese term for ''regent'' was ''bupati''. French traveller Gérard Louis Domeny de Rienzi mentions ''bapati''.&lt;ref&gt;*Grégoire Louis Domeny de Rienzi, ''Océanie ou cinquième partie du monde : revue géographique et ethnographique de la Malaisie, de la Micronésie, de la Polynésie et de la Mélanésie, ainsi que ses nouvelles classifications et divisions de ces contrées'', Firmin Didot Frères, Paris, 1834&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''bupati'' have been maintained in the modern Indonesian administrative subdivision structure, heading a ''[[Regency (Indonesia)|kabupaten]]'', the subdivision of a ''[[provinces of Indonesia|provinsi]]'' or [[province]].

The word ''Adipati'' is still found in the official title of the hereditary dukes [[Mangkunegaran Palace|Mangkunegara]] of [[Surakarta]] and [[Pakualaman|Paku Alam]] of [[Yogyakarta]]—i.e., ''Kanjeng Gusti Pangeran Adipati Arya'' (shortened into KGPAA).

===Nigeria===
In the [[Kingdom of Benin]], a [[viceroyal]] [[chieftain]] that is known as an ''Enogie'' in the [[Edo language]] is usually referred to as a duke in English. Often a cadet of the dynasty that produces the [[Oba of Benin]], the enogie is expected to rule his domain as he sees fit, subject to the approval of the oba.

In [[Ife]], [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] and the other kingdoms of Nigerian [[Yorubaland]], a viceroyal chieftain is known as a ''Baale'' in the [[Yoruba language]]. He is barred from wearing a crown as a matter of tradition, and is generally seen as the reigning representative of a monarch who has the right to wear one.

{{Tamils}}
'''Dutch Tamils''' or '''Holland Tamils''' are people of ethnic [[Tamil people|Tamil]] ancestry who reside in [[Netherlands]]. Around 20,000&lt;ref name=Sivasupramaniam/&gt; Tamils mostly from [[Sri Lanka]] are estimated to be living in [[Netherlands]]. The relationship between Tamils and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] dates back to the [[colonial era]]. The [[Dutch East India Company]] was active in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Southern India]]. In Sri Lanka, most of Tamil areas were under [[Dutch Ceylon]] rule between 1640–1796. During Dutch rule some [[List of loanwords in Sri Lankan Tamil|Dutch loanwords]] were adopted in Sri Lankan Tamil language. Back then [[Tamils]] and [[Malayalis]] were known as "[[Malabars]]" among the Portuguese and Dutch.

The earliest Tamil immigrants to [[Netherlands]] came in the 1980s, and were primarily educated personnel, businessmen and students. When the [[Sri Lankan civil war]] break out, many Tamils migrated 1984 onward were asylum seekers. Between 1984 and 1987, more than 3,500 Tamil mens arrived in Netherlands. A Second wave of Tamil refugees came between 1990 and 1992, which incluced women's and children.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of the Sri Lankan Diaspora'', Peter Reeves, p.123&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995, the population of Sri Lankans in [[Netherlands]] has doubled, in 1996 there were 5,600 and in 2010 there were 10,346 people.&lt;ref name="Sri Lankan Diaspora p.124"&gt;''The Encyclopedia of the Sri Lankan Diaspora'', Peter Reeves, p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch Tamils have low unemployment level, because they have show willingness to accept jobs, that is below their qualifications. They attach great importance to education and also pay attention to their children's education. Dutch Tamils live mostly in small towns like [[Zeist]], [[Utrecht]], [[Nieuwegein]], [[Roermond]], [[Den Bosch]], [[Breda]], [[Den Helder]] and [[Hoorn]], because the former refugees were settled away from big cities like [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="Sri Lankan Diaspora p.124"/&gt;

Most of Tamils living in Netherlands are [[Hindus]] and there are many Tamil Hindu temples (Kovils) in Netherlands like Vinayagar Temple in [[Den Helder]] or Murugan Temple in [[Roermond]]. There are Tamil [[Christian]] minorities, who belong to [[catholic]] and [[evangelic]] faith.

'''Elmer H. Inman''' (1880 – June 11, 1939) was an American criminal, bank robber, jewel thief and Depression-era outlaw. At one time considered [[Oklahoma]]'s "[[Public enemy|Public Enemy No. 1]]", he was a member of the [[Kimes-Terrill Gang]] and associated with Herman Barker and [[Wilbur Underhill, Jr.]] throughout the early-1930s.&lt;ref&gt;http://superbeefy.com/why-did-kate-ma-barker-get-her-boys-involved-in-a-gang-and-who-was-the-mastermind/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and marriage===
Elmer Inman was born in [[Kansas]] in 1880. He received his first major criminal conviction for his participation in a jewelry heist in [[Arkansas City, Kansas|Arkansas City]] and was sentenced to serve at least 10 years in [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth Penitentiary]]. Once inside, he managed to get into the good graces of Warden J.K. Codding and his family. Inman was able to convince the warden he had been [[Frameup|"jobbed"]] for the robbery and eventually became his [[chauffeur]]. Inman was also wonderfully attentive to the warden's sickly wife and began a romantic relationship with his daughter Lavona. The two were married in August 1921, shortly after Inman's parole.&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;Newton, Michael. ''The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers''. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 143-144) {{ISBN|0-8160-4488-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Lavona petitioned the state of Kansas to pardon her husband however, Inman was arrested for stealing a car in Oklahoma and was sent back to Leavenworth. It was also discovered around this time that Inman had been selling stolen jewelry throughout his time as an inmate and was charged with using the [[mail fraud|prison mail to defraud]]. On November 8, 1921, his marriage to Lavona was [[annulled]] on the grounds that, while a convicted felon, his marriage could not be recognized by the state.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

===Partnership with Herman Barker and Ray Terrill===
Finally released in 1926, Inman remained in Kansas despite his past trouble with the law. On June 7, he was arrested with Herman Barker while driving a stolen car in [[Fort Scott, Kansas|Fort Scott]]. While in custody, it was discovered that Inman was wanted for the robbery of a bank and post office in [[Ketchum, Oklahoma]]. Before he could be extradited, Inman was released on bail and left the state. He was arrested a few days later with [[Ray Terrill]] for a burglary in [[Ardmore, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

On September 27, he and Terrill overpowered a guard in the [[Carter County, Oklahoma|Carter County]] jail and escaped. Two months later, he was suspected in participating in the [[Sallisaw]] break out of [[Matthew Kimes]] by Herman Barker and Ray Terrill on November 9, 1926. At the time of his escape, Kimes was appealing his 35-year sentence for robbery and murder.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

===Kimes-Terrill Gang===
Following the jail break of Matthew Kimes, Inman became a regular member of the [[Kimes-Terrill Gang]]. Arrested for burglarizing an [[Oklahoma City]] store on December 27, 1926, he was convicted and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment on February 9, 1927. While being transported to [[McAlester, Oklahoma|McAlester]], Inman escaped from custody near [[Bolton]] and soon rejoined the gang.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

After a near-5 month crime spree across Kansas and Oklahoma, Kimes and gang member Raymond Doolin were arrested at the [[Grand Canyon]] in June. Inman and Terrill hid in [[Arkansas]] for a few months until their arrest in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]] on November 26, 1927, and were extradited back to face authorities in Oklahoma. By the end of the year, they were back in McAlester where the two were reunited with Matthew and George Kimes.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

===Inman and the "Tri-State Terror" Wilbur Underhill===
Though Kimes and Terrill would remain in prison, Inman would be released on parole by the early 1930s. He may have been involved with the [[Barker-Karpis Gang]] during 1932 and 1933, especially due to his former association with Herman Barker, but by late-1933 he had aligned himself with [[Wilbur Underhill, Jr.]] and his mob.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;

Together they tried to seal a safe from a [[Harrah, Oklahoma|Harrah]] bank on December 12, 1933, but it ended up falling through the weak floorboards and into the basement. The next day, Inman was named as one of two unidentified men who stole $4,000 from a bank in [[Coalgate, Oklahoma|Coalgate]]. Underhill was mortally wounded when police stormed his [[honeymoon|honeymoon cottage]] on December 30, 1933, and died at the prison hospital in McAlester on January 6, 1934. Inman was arrested a day later when police spotted him at a gas station in [[Bowlegs, Oklahoma]] and was injured while [[resisting arrest]]; his girlfriend Lena Nichols was also arrested. Returned to McAlester. Inman was paroled in 1939 and relocated to Medford, Oregon. He was killed in a car crash at Project City, California, on November 18, 1955 and buried in Redding, California.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4831">"'''He never married'''" was a [[code phrase]] used by [[obituary]] writers in the United Kingdom as a euphemism for the deceased having been [[homosexual]]. Its use has been dated to the second half of the twentieth century and it may be found in coded and non-coded forms such as when the subject never married but was not homosexual. A similar phrase is "confirmed bachelor".

==Usage==
The phrase was a staple euphemism of obituary writers used to imply that the subject was homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/28/politics "Death is the new black"] ''The Observer'', 28 April 2002. Retrieved 3 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=times/&gt; The ambiguity of the phrase has been commented on, however, by a number of sources. In 1999, James Fergusson, writing in ''Secrets of the Press'' about the coded language of obituaries that he compared with the clues in a [[cryptic crossword]], commented " 'He never married' closed an obituary with numbing finality" and asked "Did it, or did it not, mean that he was a hyperactive homosexual?"&lt;ref&gt;"Death in the Press" by James Fergusson in Stephen Glover (Ed.) (1999) ''Secrets of the Press''. London: Allen Lane. pp. 148–160 (p. 156) {{ISBN|0713992654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Nigel Rees]] dated its use to the second half of the twentieth century and noted that it can also be used without any implication of homosexuality, and that it also served the purpose of avoiding the use of the word gay for subjects who were open about their homosexuality but disliked the word "gay".&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Nigel. (2006) ''A man about a dog: Euphemisms &amp; other examples of verbal squeamishness''. London: Collins. p. 274. {{ISBN|9780007214532}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Bridget Fowler also noted that the phrase could be used without a double meaning in her book ''The Obituary as Collective Memory''.&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fowler, Bridget.|title=The Obituary as Collective Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ap-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|isbn=978-1-134-21802-8|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The following sentence, attributed directly to "&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1556420/Count-Gottfried-von-Bismarck.html Count Gottfried von Bismarck.] ''The Telegraph'', 4 July 2007. Retrieved 3 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;", is textbook OR, and should not be re-added to the visible text of this article without a reliable secondary source: As late as 2007, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' used the phrase to conclude its obituary of [[Count Gottfried von Bismarck]]. --&gt;

Rose Wild of ''The Times'' has observed, however, that even where used in an apparently non-coded form in historic obituaries, the phrase could still be revealing of the subject, giving the example of a school master's obituary in 1923 that stated "he never married" but continued that he "usually spent his holidays in a little inn frequented by seafaring men at Falmouth".&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

In 2016, Christian Barker of ''The Rake'', observed "Until quite recently, obituary writers had a habit of concluding with the euphemism 'He never married' to subtly indicate that the subject was gay", but continued by connecting the phrase to [[misogamy]] rather than homosexuality and asserting that there were plenty of examples of " 'confirmed bachelors' simply shrugging off the shackles of matrimony and choosing to remain single throughout their lives—experiencing no less success because of it".&lt;ref&gt;[https://therake.com/stories/icons/he-never-married/ "He Never Married" The Case for Staying Single], Christian Barker, ''The Rake'', July 2016. Retrieved 15 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Rose Wild wrote in ''The Times'' that the use of "He never married" began to die out in the late 1980s, "but not before it had become absurd". She noted its "otiose" use in the paper's obituaries for [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] (died 1989) and [[Danny La Rue]] (died 2009).&lt;ref&gt;"Don't read too much into the lives of bachelors", Rose Wild, ''The Times'', 16 September 2017, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Confirmed bachelor"==
{{wiktionary|confirmed bachelor}}
A similar euphemism was "confirmed bachelor", which was used in the second half of the twentieth century by the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''. Rose Wild reported in ''[[The Times]]'' in May 2016, however, that she could only find around a dozen examples of the phrase in the paper's obituaries, some of which were of a non-coded form, causing her to wonder whether the phrase existed much outside the imagination of the writers of ''Private Eye''.&lt;ref name=times&gt;"Lives remembered with a loaded phrase or two", Rose Wild, ''The Times'', 21 May 2016, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In October 2018, Frank Chung of [[news.com.au]] wrote that the marketing style could be "perceived as a [[scam]] or [[pyramid scheme]]".&lt;ref name="news.com.au"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030052631/https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/investing/what-is-initiative-q-payment-network-insists-its-not-a-pyramid-scheme/news-story/193102b9fbb5c35d6365f7f34226908f |archivedate=30 October 2018 |url=https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/investing/what-is-initiative-q-payment-network-insists-its-not-a-pyramid-scheme/news-story/193102b9fbb5c35d6365f7f34226908f |website=[[news.com.au]] |deadurl=no |title=What is Initiative Q?

"Is Initiative Q real or fake? Short answer – we have absolutely no idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a869483/what-is-initiative-q-bitcoin-real-fake-scam/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181101235354/http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a869483/what-is-initiative-q-bitcoin-real-fake-scam/ |website=[[DigitalSpy.com]] |deadurl=no |archivedate=1 November 2018 |title=What is Initiative Q: Is it the new bitcoin, or just one big fake scam? |first=Owen |last=Gough |date=2 November 2018 |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brendan Markey-Tower of [[Stuff.co.nz]] explained in November 2018 that the scheme wouldn't "make you fabulously wealthy. It is, nonetheless, an interesting idea".&lt;ref name="stuff"&gt;{{cite web |title=Initiative Q is not the new Bitcoin, but here's why the idea has value |deadurl=no |archivedate=6 November 2018 |website=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/opinion-analysis/108380918/Initiative-Q-is-not-the-new-Bitcoin-but-heres-why-the-idea-has-value |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106135456/https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/opinion-analysis/108380918/Initiative-Q-is-not-the-new-Bitcoin-but-heres-why-the-idea-has-value |first=Brendan |last=Markey-Towler |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huszák enumerated potential problems with the scheme such as no clear crypto-currency security measures, unclear transaction/[[Foreign exchange market|exchange]] costs, and potential for [[market manipulation]] by the largest holders of currency.&lt;ref name="portfolio.hu"/&gt;

'''Irish nationality law''' is contained in the provisions of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004'' and in the relevant provisions of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish Constitution]]. A person may be an Irish citizen&lt;ref&gt;In Irish law the terms "nationality" and "citizenship" have equivalent meanings.&lt;/ref&gt; through birth, descent, marriage to an Irish citizen or through [[Naturalization|naturalisation]]. The law grants citizenship to individuals born in [[Northern Ireland]] under the same conditions as those born in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

==History==

===The Irish Free State Constitution===
[[File:Irish Free State passport.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Irish Free State]] passport cover as issued 1927 (holder's name removed)]]
[[File:Healy passport.jpg|thumb|upright|'Request' page of the Irish Free State passport as issued in 1927]]
Irish citizenship originates from Article 3 of the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] which came into force on 6 December 1922, however Irish citizenship applied only domestically until the enactment of the Twenty-sixth Amendment on 5 April 1935 which applied it internationally.&lt;ref&gt;According to Article 3 of the Free State Constitution Irish citizenship had previously only "within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann)". The Twenty Sixth amendment deleted the condition to extend the duties and right of Irish citizenship outside of the Free State.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dáil Debates, 14 February 1935, Vol. 54 No. 12 Col. 2049, Constitution (Amendment No. 26) Bill, 1934, Second Stage, The President. [http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1935021400022?opendocument]&lt;/ref&gt; Any person [[domicile (law)|domicile]]d in the island of Ireland on 6 December 1922 was an Irish citizen if:

* he or she was in the island of Ireland; 
* at least one of his or her parents was born in the island of Ireland; or
* he or she had been ordinarily resident in the island of Ireland for at least seven years; 
except that "any such person being a citizen of another State" could "[choose] not to accept" Irish citizenship. (The Article also stated that "the conditions governing the future acquisition and termination of citizenship in the Irish Free State [...] shall be determined by law".)

While the Constitution referred to those domiciled "in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State", this was interpreted as meaning the entire island. This was because the Constitution was formally governed by the terms of the 1921 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], which stated that "the powers of the Parliament and government of the Irish Free State shall not be exercisable as respects Northern Ireland" before 6 January 1923, unless in that time both the two Houses of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] had exercised a right to present an address to the [[British monarchy|King]] that "the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland". The two Houses exercised that right within two days of the Constitution coming into force on 6 December 1922.&lt;ref&gt;On 13 December 1922, Prime Minister Craig addressed the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] and reported that the King had received that Parliament's address to withdraw from the Free State and had informed his ministers and the Irish Free State Government. Only when the King had done so did Northern Ireland's withdrawal from the Free State become effective. See: [http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&amp;pageno=1145#fwd-2-1189 Northern Ireland Parliamentary Report, 13 December 1922, Volume 2 (1922), Cols. 1191–1192]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this background, it was held by the Irish Free State's courts that Northern Ireland had been "within the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State" on 6 December 1922.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Logue'' [1933] 67 ILTR 253. The decision resulted in changes being made the ''[[History of British nationality law#British Nationality Act 1948|British Nationality Act 1948]]'' by section 5 the ''[[Ireland Act 1949]]'', to ensure that people who were domiciled in Northern Ireland on 6 December 1922 but were born elsewhere in Ireland would not fail to become a "citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies" merely because they were also an Irish citizen.&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of the Irish Free State as a [[dominion]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] was seen by the British authorities as meaning that a "citizen of the Irish Free State" was merely a member of the wider category of "British subject"; this interpretation could be supported by the wording of Article 3 of the Constitution, which stated that the privileges and obligations of Irish citizenship applied "within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State". However, the Irish authorities repeatedly rejected the idea that its citizens had the additional status of "British subject".&lt;ref name="qub.ac.uk"&gt;Brian Ó Caoindealbháin (2006) ''Citizenship and Borders: Irish Nationality Law and Northern Ireland''. Centre for International Borders Research, Queen's University of Belfast and Institute for British-Irish Studies, University College Dublin. [http://www.qub.ac.uk/cibr/WPpdffiles/MFWPpdf/w18_boc.pdf Accessed 04-06-09]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, while the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] for members of the [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State|Oireachtas]], as set out in Article 17 of the Constitution, and as required by Art. 4 of the Treaty, referred to "the common citizenship of Ireland with Great Britain", a 1929 memorandum on nationality and citizenship prepared by the [[Department of Justice and Equality|Department of Justice]] at the request of the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Ireland)|Department of External Affairs]] for the [[Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The reference to 'common citizenship' in the Oath means little or nothing. 'Citizenship' is not a term of English law at all. There is not, in fact, 'common citizenship' throughout the British Commonwealth: the Indian 'citizen' is treated by the Australian 'citizen' as an undesirable alien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://difp.ie/docs/Volume3/1929/1355.htm|title=Extract from a memorandum on nationality and citizenship|work=Documents on Irish Foreign Policy|publisher=Royal Irish Academy|accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Irish passport]]s were issued from 1923, and to the general public from 1924, but the British government [[Irish passport#1930s controversy with the UK over the description of citizens as subjects|objected to them, and their wording]] for many years. Using an Irish Free State passport abroad, if consular assistance from a British Embassy was required, could lead to administrative difficulties.

===Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1935===
The 1922 Constitution provided for citizenship for only those alive on 6 December 1922. No provision was made for those born after this date. As such it was a temporary provision which required the enactment of a fully-fledged citizenship law which was done by the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1935''. This Act provided for, among other things:
* Irish citizenship by birth for anyone born within the [[Irish Free State]] on or after 6 December 1922;
* Irish citizenship by descent for anyone whose '''father''' was an Irish citizen at the time of his or her birth, provided such birth was registered in register of Northern-Ireland- or foreign births;
* a naturalisation procedure; and
* automatic [[Denaturalization|denaturalisation]] for anyone who became a citizen of another country on or after reaching 21 years of age.
The provision of citizenship by descent had the effect, given the interpretation noted above, of providing citizenship for those in Northern Ireland born after 6 December 1922 so long as their father had been resident anywhere in Ireland on said date. However, this automatic entitlement was limited to the first generation, with the citizenship of subsequent generations requiring registration and the surrendering of any other citizenship held at the age of 21. The combination of the principles of birth and descent in the Act respected the state's territorial boundary, with residents of Northern Ireland treated "in an identical manner to persons of Irish birth or descent who resided in Britain or a foreign country".&lt;ref&gt;Daly, Mary (2001) "Irish nationality and citizenship since 1922", Irish historical studies 32 (127): 377-407. Cited in Ó Caoindealbháin (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brian Ó Caoindealbháin, the 1935 Act was, therefore, compatible with the state's existing borders, respecting and, in effect, reinforcing them.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Caoindealbháin (2006), p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also provided for the establishment of the [[Foreign Births Register]].

Further, the 1935 Act was an attempt to assert the sovereignty of the Free State and the distinct nature of Irish citizenship, and to end the ambiguity over the relations between Irish citizenship and British subject status. Nonetheless, London continued to recognise Irish citizens as British subjects until the passing of the Ireland Act 1949, which recognised, as a distinct class of persons, "citizens of the Republic of Ireland".&lt;ref name="qub.ac.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Síofra O’Leary (1996) ''Irish nationality law'', in B Nascimbene (ed.), Nationality laws in the European Union, Milan: Butterworths, cited in Ó Caoindealbháin (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1923, some new economic rights were created for Irish citizens. The 1923 Land Act allowed the [[Irish Land Commission]] to refuse to allow a purchase of farmland by a non-Irish citizen; during the [[Anglo-Irish Trade War]] the Control of Manufactures Act 1932 required that at least 50% of the ownership of Irish-registered companies had to be held by Irish citizens.

===The 1937 Constitution===
The 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] simply maintained the previous citizenship body, also providing, as the previous constitution had done, that the further acquisition and loss of Irish citizenship was to be regulated by law.

With regard to Northern Ireland, despite the irredentist nature and rhetorical claims of [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|articles 2 and 3 of the new constitution]], the compatibility of Irish citizenship law with the state's boundaries remained unaltered.&lt;ref name="Ó Caoindealbháin 2006"&gt;Ó Caoindealbháin (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956===
In 1956, the [[Oireachtas|Irish parliament]] enacted the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956''. This Act repealed the 1935 Act and remains, although heavily amended, the basis of Irish citizenship law. This act, according to Ó Caoindealbháin, altered radically the treatment of Northern Ireland residents in Irish citizenship law. With the enactment of the [[Republic of Ireland Act]] in 1948, and the subsequent passage of the [[Ireland Act]] by the British government in 1949, the state's constitutional independence was assured, facilitating the resolution of the unsatisfactory position from an Irish nationalist perspective whereby births in Northern Ireland were assimilated to "foreign" births. The Irish government was explicit in its aim to amend this situation, seeking to extend citizenship as widely as possible to Northern Ireland, as well as to Irish emigrants and their descendents abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Ó Caoindealbháin (2006) Citizenship and Borders: Irish Nationality Law and Northern Ireland. Centre for International Borders Research, Queen's University of Belfast and Institute for British-Irish Studies, University College Dublin&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act therefore provided for Irish citizenship for anyone born in the island of Ireland whether before or after independence. The only limitations to which were that anyone born in [[Northern Ireland]] was not automatically an Irish citizen but entitled to be an Irish citizen and, that a child of someone entitled to diplomatic immunity in the state would not become an Irish citizen. The Act also provided for open-ended citizenship by descent and for citizenship by registration for the wives (but not husbands) of Irish citizens.

The treatment of Northern Ireland residents in these sections had considerable significance for the state's territorial boundaries, given that their "sensational effect … was to confer, in the eyes of Irish law, citizenship on the vast majority of the Northern Ireland population".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, JM (1994) The Irish constitution, 3rd ed. Dublin: Butterworths, cited in Ó Caoindealbháin (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The compatibility
of this innovation with international law, according to Ó Caoindealbháin was dubious, "given its attempt to regulate the citizenship of an external territory ... In seeking to extend ''jus soli'' citizenship beyond the state’s jurisdiction, the 1956 Act openly sought to subvert the territorial boundary between North and South". The implications of the Act were readily recognised in Northern Ireland, with [[Lord Brookeborough]] tabling a motion in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] repudiating “the gratuitous attempt … to inflict unwanted Irish Republican nationality upon the people of Northern Ireland”.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, Mary (2001) “Irish nationality and citizenship since 1922”, Irish historical studies 32 (127): 377-407. Cited in Ó Caoindealbháin (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Irish citizenship continued to be extended to the inhabitants of Northern Ireland for over 40 years, representing, according to Ó Caoindealbháin, "one of the few practical expressions of the Irish state’s irredentism." Ó Caoindealbháin concludes, however, that the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998 altered significantly the territorial implications of Irish citizenship law, if somewhat ambiguously, via two key provisions: the renunciation of the constitutional territorial claim over Northern Ireland, and the recognition of "the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted
as Irish or British or both, as they may so choose", and that "their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments".

In regard to international law, Ó Caoindealbháin states that, although it is the attempt to confer citizenship extra-territorially without the agreement of the state affected that represents a breach of international law (not the actual extension), the 1956 Act "co-exists uneasily with the terms of the Agreement, and, by extension, the official acceptance by the Irish state of the current border. While the Agreement recognises that Irish citizenship is the birthright of those born in Northern Ireland, it makes clear that its acceptance is a matter of individual choice. In contrast, the 1956 Act continues to extend citizenship automatically in the majority of cases, thereby, in legal effect, conflicting with the agreed status of the border and the principle of consent".&lt;ref name="Ó Caoindealbháin 2006"/&gt;

===Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1986 and 1994===
In 1986, the 1956 Act was amended by the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1986''. This Act was primarily concerned with removing various gender discriminatory provisions from the 1956 legislation and thus provided for citizenship by registration for the wives and husbands of Irish citizens.

The Act also restricted the open-ended citizenship by descent granted by the 1956 Act by dating the citizenship of third, fourth and subsequent generations of Irish emigrants born abroad, from registration and not from birth. This limited the rights of fourth and subsequent generations to citizenship to those whose parents had been registered before their birth. The Act provided for a six-month transitional period during which the old rules would still apply. Such was the increase in volume of applications for registration from third, fourth and further generation Irish emigrants, the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1994'' was enacted to deal with those individuals who applied for registration within the six-month period but who could not be registered in time.

===''Jus soli'' and the Irish Constitution===
Up until the late 1990s, ''[[jus soli]]'', in the Republic, was maintained as a matter of statute law, the only people being constitutionally entitled to citizenship of the Irish state post-1937 were those who had been citizens of the Irish Free State before its dissolution. However, in 1998 as part of the new constitutional settlement brought about by the [[Belfast Agreement]], the [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] provided (among other things) that:

{{quote|It is the entitlement and birthright of every person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, to be part of the Irish nation. That is also the entitlement of all persons otherwise qualified in accordance with law to be citizens of Ireland.}}

The introduction of this guarantee resulted in the enshrinement of ''jus soli'' as a constitutional right for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;This is clearly the view of Denham, McGuinness and Hardiman JJ, in ''Osayande v. Minister for Justice,'' a view which is supported by the current writers of ''[[#References|Kelly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast the only people entitled to British citizenship as a result of the Belfast Agreement are people born in Northern Ireland to Irish citizens, British citizens and permanent residents.

If immigration was not on the political agenda in 1998, it did not take long to become so afterwards. Indeed, soon after the agreement, the already rising strength of the Irish economy reversed the historic pattern of emigration to one of immigration, a reversal which in turn resulted in a large number of foreign nationals claiming a right to remain in the state based on their Irish-born citizen children.&lt;ref&gt;The Irish Department of Justice granted leave to remain in the state to around 10,500 non-nationals between 1996 and February 2003 on the basis of their having an Irish born child – [http://www.justice.ie/80256E01003A02CF/vWeb/pcJUSQ6PLE7P-en Department of Justice Press Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210061715/http://www.justice.ie/80256E01003A02CF/vWeb/pcJUSQ6PLE7P-en |date=10 February 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; They did so on the basis of a 1989 [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] ruling ''Fajujonu v. Minister for Justice'' where the court prohibited the deportation of the foreign parents of an Irish citizen. In January 2003, the Supreme Court distinguished the earlier decision and ruled that it was constitutional for the Government to deport the parents of children who were Irish citizens.&lt;ref&gt;''Osayande v. Minister for Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; This latter decision would have been thought to put the matter to rest but concerns remained about the propriety of the (albeit indirect) deportation of Irish citizens and what was perceived as the overly generous provisions of Irish nationality law.

In March 2004, the government introduced the draft Bill for the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] to remedy what the Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell, described as an "abuse of citizenship" whereby citizenship was "conferred on persons with no tangible link to the nation or the State whether of parentage, upbringing or of long-term residence in the State".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from the [http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20040421.xml&amp;Dail=29&amp;Ex=All&amp;Page=3 Daíl debate].&lt;/ref&gt; The Amendment did not propose to change the wording of [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]] as introduced by the Nineteenth Amendment, but instead to insert a clause clawing back the power to determine the future acquisition and loss of Irish citizenship by statute, as previously exercised by [[Oireachtas|parliament]] before the Nineteenth amendment. The government also cited concerns about the ''[[Chen case]]'', then before the [[European Court of Justice]], in which a Chinese woman who had been living in [[Wales]] had gone to give birth in Northern Ireland on legal advice. Mrs. Chen then pursued a case against the British Home Secretary to prevent her deportation from the [[United Kingdom]] on the basis of her child's right as a [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizen of the European Union]] (derived from the child's Irish citizenship) to reside in a member state of the Union. (Ultimately Mrs. Chen won her case, but this was not clear until ''after'' the result of the referendum.) Both the proposed amendment and the timing of the referendum were contentious but the result was decisively in favour of the proposal; 79% of those voting voted ''yes'', on a turnout of 59%.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of the amendment was to prospectively restrict the constitutional right to citizenship by birth to those who are born on the island of Ireland to at least one parent who is (or is someone entitled to be) an Irish citizen. Those born on the island of Ireland before the coming into force of the amendment continue to have a constitutional right to citizenship. Moreover, ''jus soli'' primarily existed in legislation and it remained, after the referendum, for [[Oireachtas|parliament]] to pass ordinary legislation that would modify it. This was in fact done by the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004'' (the effects of which are detailed [[#At birth|above]]). It remains, however, a matter for the legislature and unrestricted ''jus soli'' could be re-established by ordinary legislation without a referendum.

==Acquisition of citizenship==

===At birth===
A person born on the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]] on or after 1 January 2005:&lt;ref&gt;This dates relates to the commencement date of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004'' and not the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Twenty-seventh Amendment]] as is sometimes thought.&lt;/ref&gt;
* is ''automatically'' an Irish citizen if he or she is not entitled to the citizenship of any other country;&lt;ref&gt;Section 6(3) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt; or
* is ''entitled'' to be an Irish citizen if at least one of his  or her parents is:
**an Irish citizen (or someone entitled to be an Irish citizen);&lt;ref&gt;Sections 6(1), 6A(2)(b) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt;
**a British citizen;&lt;ref&gt;Sections 6(1) and 6A(2)(c) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt;
**a resident of the island of Ireland who is entitled to reside in either the Republic or in Northern Ireland without any time limit on that residence;&lt;ref&gt;Sections 6(1), 6A(2)(c) and (d) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt; or
**a legal resident of the island of Ireland for three out of the 4 years preceding the child's birth (although time spent as a student or as an asylum seeker does not count for this purpose).&lt;ref&gt;Sections 6(1), 6A(1) and 6B of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt;
A person who is ''entitled'' to become an Irish citizen becomes an Irish citizen if:
* he or she does any act that only Irish citizens are entitled to do; or
* any act that only Irish citizens are entitled to do is done on his or her behalf by a person entitled to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Section 6(2) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Dual citizenship]] is permitted under Irish nationality law.

====December 1999 to 2005====
Ireland previously had a much less diluted application of ''[[jus soli]]'' (the right to citizenship of the country of birth) which still applies to anyone born on or before 31 December 2004.
Although passed in 2001, the applicable law was deemed enacted on 2 December 1999&lt;ref&gt;The relevant sections of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001'' that was signed by the President on 5 June 2001, were backdated to apply from the changes made to Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution under the Good Friday Agreement: Minister for Justice, John O'Donoghue, ''Seanad Debates'' volume 161 column 982 (8 December 1999) {{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0161/S.0161.199912080005.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607110425/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0161/S.0161.199912080005.html |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and provided that anyone born on the island of Ireland is:
*''entitled'' to be an Irish citizen and
*''automatically'' an Irish citizen if he or she was not entitled to the citizenship of any other country.

====Prior to 1999====
The previous legislation was largely replaced by the 1999 changes, which were retroactive in effect. Before 2 December 1999, the distinction between Irish citizenship and entitlement to Irish citizenship rested on the place of birth. Under this regime, any person born on the island of Ireland was:
* ''automatically'' an Irish citizen if born:
** on the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]] before 6 December 1922,
** in the territory which currently comprises the [[Republic of Ireland]], or
** in [[Northern Ireland]] on or after 6 December 1922 with a parent who was an Irish citizen at the time of birth;
* ''entitled'' to be an Irish citizen if born in [[Northern Ireland]] and not automatically an Irish citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Sections 6(1) and 7(1) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956'', as enacted.&lt;/ref&gt;
The provisions of the 1956 Act were, in terms of citizenship by birth, retroactive and replaced the provisions of the previous legislation, the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1935''. Under that legislation, those born in Northern Ireland on or after 6 December 1922 did not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship by birth.{{Citation needed|reason=This needs to be verified|date=November 2016}}
Citizenship of the Irish Free State was determined under the 1922 constitution, as amended by the [[Constitution (Amendment No. 26) Act 1935]].

====Children of diplomats====
Like most countries, Ireland does not normally grant citizenship to the children of diplomats. This does not apply, however, when a diplomat parents a child with an Irish citizen, a British citizen or a permanent resident.&lt;ref&gt;Section 6(6) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Ireland enacted a measure which allowed the children of diplomats to register as Irish citizens if they chose to do so; however, this was repealed three years later.&lt;ref&gt;Section 6(4) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004'', as inserted by the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001'' and later repealed by the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004''&lt;/ref&gt; The option to register remains for those born to diplomats before 2005.

===By descent===
A person is an Irish citizen by descent if, at the time of his or her birth, at least one of his or her parents was an Irish citizen. Place of birth is not a deciding factor.&lt;ref name="7-1"&gt;Section 7(1) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where at least one parent was an Irish citizen born in the island of Ireland&lt;ref name="7-1"/&gt; or an Irish citizen resident abroad in the public service,&lt;ref&gt;Section 7(3)(b) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt; citizenship is automatic and dates from birth. In all other cases citizenship is subject to registration in the [[Foreign Births Entry Book|Foreign Births Register]].&lt;ref&gt;Section 7(3) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to legislative changes introduced in 1986, the Irish citizenship of those individuals requiring registration, dates from registration and not from birth, for citizenship registered on or after 1 January 1987.&lt;ref&gt;While the 1986 act, which brought in the registration requirement, came into force on 1 July 1986, section 8 of the Act allowed for a six-month transitional period when people could still register under the old provisions. See: Minister for Justice, [[Máire Geoghegan-Quinn]], ''Dáil debates'' [http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0140/S.0140.199404210005.html volume 140 column 131] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607084712/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0140/S.0140.199404210005.html |date=7 June 2011 }} (21 April 1994); Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, [[Liz McManus]], ''Seanad Debates'' [http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0142/S.0142.199504040010.html volume 142 column 1730] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607084732/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0142/S.0142.199504040010.html |date=7 June 2011 }} (4 April 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Citizenship by registration had previously been back-dated to birth.

Anyone with an Irish citizen grandparent born on the island of Ireland is eligible for Irish citizenship. His or her parent would have automatically been an Irish citizen and their own citizenship can be secured by registering themselves in the Foreign Births Register. In contrast, those wishing to claim citizenship through an Irish citizen great-grandparent would be unable to do so unless their parents were placed into the Foreign Births Register. Their parents can transmit Irish citizenship to only those children born after they themselves were registered and not to any children born before registration.

Citizenship acquired through descent may be maintained indefinitely so long as each generation ensures its registration before the birth of the next.

===By adoption===
All adoptions performed or recognised under Irish law confer Irish citizenship on the adopted child (if not already an Irish citizen) if at least one of the adopters was an Irish citizen at the time of the adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Section 11 of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956'' as amended by section 175 of the ''Adoption Act 2010''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===By marriage===
From 30 November 2005 (three years after the 2001 Citizenship Act came into force),&lt;ref name="2001-act-commencement"&gt;Section 4 of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001'' came into force on 30 November 2002 by ministerial order: [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2002/si/128/made/en/print Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001 (Commencement) Order, 2002].&lt;/ref&gt; citizenship of the spouse of an Irish citizen must be acquired through the normal naturalisation process.&lt;ref&gt;The previous provisions having been repealed by section 4 of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001''.&lt;/ref&gt; The residence requirement is reduced from 5 to 3 years in this case, and the spouse must intend to continue to reside in the island of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Sections 15A(1)(e) and (f) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956'' as inserted by the section 33 of the ''Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the law allowed for the spouses of most Irish citizens to acquire citizenship post-nuptially by registration without residence in the island of Ireland, or by naturalisation.&lt;ref&gt;Section 8 of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956'' and section 3 of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986''.&lt;/ref&gt;

* From 17 July 1956 to 31 December 1986,&lt;ref name="1986-act-commencement"&gt;The ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986'' came into force on 1 July 1986, section 8 of the Act allowed for a six-month transitional period during which both the new and old provisions were in force.&lt;/ref&gt; the wife (but not the husband) of an Irish citizen (other than by naturalisation) could apply for post-nuptial citizenship. A woman who applied for this before marriage would become an Irish citizen upon marriage. This was a retrospective provision which could be applied to marriages made before 1956. However the citizenship granted was prospective only.&lt;ref&gt;Section 8 of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956'' as enacted.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Between 1 July 1986&lt;ref name="1986-act-commencement"/&gt; and 29 November 2005,&lt;ref name="2001-act-commencement"/&gt; the spouse of an Irish citizen (other than by naturalisation, honorary citizenship or a previous marriage) could obtain post-nuptial citizenship after 3 years of subsisting marriage, provided the Irish spouse had held that status for at least 3 years. Like the provisions it replaced, the application of this regime was also retrospective.&lt;ref&gt;Section 3 of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===By naturalisation===
The naturalisation of a foreigner as an Irish citizen is a discretionary power held by the Irish [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Minister for Justice]]. Naturalisation is granted on a number of criteria including good character, residence in the state and intention to continue residing in the state.

In principle the residence requirement is three years if married to an Irish citizen, and five years otherwise. Time spent seeking asylum will not be counted. Nor will time spent as an illegal immigrant. Time spent studying in the state by a national of a non-[[European Economic Area|EEA]] state (i.e. a state other than [[European Union]] Member States, [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Liechtenstein]]) will not count.

The Minister for Justice may waive the residency requirement for:

* the children of naturalised citizens;
* recognised refugees;
* stateless children;
* those resident abroad in the service of the Irish state; and
* people of "Irish descent or Irish associations".

===By grant of honorary citizenship===
{{anchor|Honorary}}Section 12 of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956'' allows the President, on [[advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the Government, to " ... grant Irish citizenship as a token of honour to a person, or the child or grandchild of a person who, in the opinion of the Government, has done signal honour or rendered distinguished service to the nation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA26Y1956S12.html Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 Section 12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210221826/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA26Y1956S12.html |date=10 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although known as "honorary Irish citizenship", this is in fact legally a full form of citizenship, with entitlement to an Irish passport and the other rights of Irish citizenship on the same basis as a naturalised Irish citizen. This has been awarded only a few times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfa.ie/uploads/documents/New%20York%20PM/presidential%20award%20notice%20and%20guidelines.pdf|title=Presidential Distinguished Service Award for the Irish Abroad|author=Irish Abroad Unit|publisher=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|pages=Sec.5|accessdate=10 September 2013|location=Dublin|quote=This provision has been invoked on only a small number of occasions and recipients have included Jack Charlton, Jean Kennedy Smith, Alfred Beit, Alfred Chester Beatty and to Mr and Mrs Tip O’Neill. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first twelve people to have had honorary Irish citizenship conferred on them are:&lt;ref name=dail_debate&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2004113000023?opendocument#N38 |first=Michael |last=McDowell |authorlink=Michael McDowell (politician) |work=Dáil debates |title=Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill 2004: Report Stage (Resumed) |page=Vol.593 No.5 p.23 c.1181 |date=30 November 2004 |accessdate=10 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/artist-made-honorary-citizen-26162428.html|title=Artist made honorary citizen|last=Anderson|first=Nicola|date=14 January 1999|work=Irish Independent|quote=Dr Hill is just the 11th person to be awarded honorary citizenship since the foundation of the State.|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans were made to grant honorary Irish citizenship to U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]] during his visit to Ireland in 1963, but this was abandoned owing to legal difficulties in granting citizenship to a foreign head of state.&lt;ref name=jfk&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121011060646/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2006/1229/1166138589793.html Sniper threat sparked alert during 1963 Kennedy visit] &amp;mdash; ''[[The Irish Times]]'' newspaper article, 29 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of citizenship==

===By renunciation===
An Irish citizen may renounce his or her citizenship if he or she is:
* eighteen years or older,
* ordinarily resident abroad, and
* is, or is about to become, a citizen of another country.
Renunciation is done by lodging a declaration with the Minister for Justice. If the person is not already a citizen of another country it is only effective when he or she becomes such. Irish citizenship cannot be lost by the operation of the law of another country,&lt;ref&gt;Section 21 of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004''&lt;/ref&gt; but foreign law may require a person to renounce Irish citizenship before acquiring foreign nationality (see [[Multiple citizenship#Multiple citizenship avoided]]).

An Irish citizen born on the island of Ireland who renounces Irish citizenship remains entitled to be an Irish citizen and may resume it upon declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Section 6(5) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While not positively stated in the Act, the possibility of renouncing Irish citizenship is provided to allow Irish citizens to be naturalised as citizens of foreign countries whose laws do not allow for [[multiple citizenship]]. The Minister of Justice ''may'' revoke the citizenship of a naturalised citizen if he or she voluntarily acquires the citizenship of another country (other than by marriage) after naturalisation but there is no provision requiring them to renounce any citizenship they previously held. Similarly, there no provision of Irish law requiring citizens to renounce their Irish citizenship before becoming citizens of other countries.

===By revocation of a certificate of naturalisation===
A certificate of naturalisation may be revoked by the Minister for Justice. Once revoked the person to whom the certificate applies ceases to be an Irish citizen. Revocation is not automatic and is a discretionary power of the Minister. A certificate may be revoked if it was obtained by fraud or when the naturalised citizen to whom it applies:

* resides outside the state (or outside the island of Ireland in respect to naturalised spouses of Irish citizens) for a period exceeding seven years, otherwise than in the public service, without registering annually his or her intention to retain Irish citizenship (this provision does not apply to those who were naturalised owing to their "Irish descent or Irish associations");
* voluntarily acquires the citizenship of another country (other than by marriage); or
* "has, by any [[overt act]], shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State".&lt;ref&gt;Section 19(1)(b) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004''&lt;/ref&gt;

A notice of the revocation of a certificate of naturalisation must be published in ''[[Iris Oifigiúil]]'' (the official [[gazette]] of the Republic), but in the years of 2002 to 2012 (inclusive) no certificates of naturalisation were revoked.&lt;ref&gt;See the Official journal's [http://www.irisoifigiuil.ie Website]. The period reflects the length of the Gazette's availability online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascireland.org/campaign-for-change/naturalisation-citizenship/pq-naturalisation-applications-revoked/|title=PQ: NATURALISATION APPLICATIONS (REVOKED)|date=28 May 2013|publisher=NASC The Irish Immigrant Support Centre|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual citizenship==
Ireland allows its citizens to hold foreign citizenship in addition to their Irish citizenship. Some countries, however, do not permit multiple citizenship e.g. adults who acquired Irish and [[Japanese citizenship]] by birth must declare, to the latter's [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]], before turning 22, which citizenship they want to keep.

==Citizenship of the European Union==
Because Ireland forms part of the [[European Union]], Irish citizens are also [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] under [[European Union law]] and thus enjoy [[Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states|rights of free movement]] and have the right to vote in [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/ireland/index_en.htm | title=Ireland | publisher=European Union | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in a non-EU country where there is no Irish embassy, Irish citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Stated_rights|Rights abroad: Right to consular protection]]: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). [[Antigua and Barbuda]] (UK), [[Barbados]] (UK), [[Belize]] (UK), [[Central African Republic]] (France), [[Comoros]] (France), [[Gambia]] (UK), [[Guyana]] (UK), [[Liberia]] (Germany), [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] (UK), [[San Marino]] (Italy), [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] (Portugal), [[Solomon Islands]] (UK), [[Timor-Leste]] (Portugal), [[Vanuatu]] (France)&lt;/ref&gt; Irish citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in [[Treaties of the European Union|Article 21 of the EU Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF |format=PDF|title=Treaty on the Function of the European Union  (consolidated version)|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2016 [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|UK referendum]] on leaving the EU, which resulted in a vote to leave the European Union, there was a large increase in applications by British citizens for Irish passports, so that they can retain their rights as EU citizens after the [[Brexit|UK's withdrawal from the EU]]. There were 25,207 applications for Irish passports from Britons in the 12 months before the referendum,  and 64,400 in the 12 months after. Applications to other EU countries also increased by a large percentage, but were numerically much smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-41430927 |title=Brexit: Are more British nationals applying for dual nationality in the EU? - BBC News |newspaper=BBC |date=  |author= |accessdate= 29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel freedom of Irish citizens==
{{Main|Visa requirements for Irish citizens|Irish passport}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Irish citizens.png|upright=1.75|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for Irish citizens]] {{legend|#FDC421|Ireland}}{{legend|#042E9B|Freedom of movement}}{{legend|#22B14C|Visa not required}}{{legend|#B5E61D|Visa on arrival}}{{legend|#61c09a|eVisa}}{{legend|#79D343|Visa available both on arrival or online}}{{legend|#A8ACAB|Visa required prior to arrival}}]]

Visa requirements for Irish citizens are travel restrictions placed upon citizens of the [[Republic of Ireland]] by the authorities of other states. In 2018, Irish citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 185 countries and territories, jointly ranking the Irish passport 6th worldwide according to the [[Henley Passport Index]].&lt;ref name="ranking"&gt;Ranks are assigned using [[Ranking#Dense ranking ("1223" ranking)|dense ranking]]. A [[Ranking#Standard competition ranking ("1224" ranking)|standard ranking]] places the Irish passport joint 16th.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Henley Passport Index 2018|url=https://www.henleypassportindex.com/passport-index|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish nationality is ranked ninth in [[The Quality of Nationality Index|Nationality Index]] (QNI). This index differs from the [[Henley Passport Index|Visa Restrictions Index]], which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&amp;IR=T |title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-02-06 |website=  www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Lafleur''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman famous for his role in the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] [[sponsorship scandal]].

==Role in Sponsorship scandal==
On April 27, 2007, Lafleur returned to Canada from a two-year stay in [[Belize]], where he was reported to have lived in an exclusive villa and enjoyed fine wines. Lafleur pleaded guilty to 28 fraud charges for his role in the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070427.wlafleur0427/BNStory/National/home|first=Tu Thanh|last=Ha|title=Lafleur pleads guilty to 28 fraud charges|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=27 April 2007|accessdate=2007-04-27}}{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429040401/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070427.wlafleur0427/BNStory/National/home|date=29 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He gave 76 false invoices to [[Charles Guite]], the civil servant responsible for the sponsorship program in Public Works Department of the federal government in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="lfpress"&gt;[http://www.lfpress.ca/newsstand/News/National/2007/06/28/4296708-sun.html lfpress.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

Counting time served, Lafleur was given a sentence of 42 months in prison,&lt;ref name="lfpress"/&gt; and ordered to pay back CDN $1.6 million to the federal government. His sentence was the highest handed out in the scandal, as he showed no remorse or co-operation in the investigation and trial.&lt;ref name="lfpress"/&gt; The [[crown prosecutor]] had sought a sentence of five years.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2007/06/27/lafleur-sponsorhip.html?ref=rss cbc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allison Hoover Bartlett, who wrote ''The Man Who Loved Books Too Much'' chronicling Gilkey's thefts and methods, stated that he felt he deserved the books. She also noted that Gilkey would tell her the details of a theft after the statute of limitations on that crime had expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bartlett|2009|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jorge Roca Suarez''', also known as "''Techo de Paja''", is a [[Bolivian Americans|Bolivian-American]] [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficker]], best known for being the nephew and successor of notorious [[drug lord]] [[Roberto Suárez Goméz]]. He is currently serving a 30-year sentence in a California prison.

==Criminal career==
Before working with his uncle, Suarez ran a used-car business in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;http://openjurist.org/43/f3d/1480/united-states-v-roca-suarez&lt;/ref&gt; Suarez began to be involved in the drug trade by supplying cocaine to [[Los Pepes]] and laundering the drug money from Bolivia to the United States. At his prime, Suarez's net worth was estimated around $50–60 million and owned cattle ranches in [[Beni Department|Beni]], a horse club, a supermarket chain and a luxury home in [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-37423&lt;/ref&gt; Suarez led massive drug operations in Bolivia and soon became the most wanted fugitive in Bolivia after the arrest of his uncle.&lt;ref name=taxevasion&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-15/local/me-5685_1_tax-evasion&lt;/ref&gt; While the family income in 1985 was $75,536.92, Suarez evaded tax incomes, which would have lowered the monetary value to $2,121,053.&lt;ref name=taxevasion/&gt;

==Arrest==
On December 16, 1990, Jorge Suarez and his wife Cecilia was arrested after a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] raid on Suarez's 19-room home in [[San Marino, California]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/16/us/bolivian-couple-seized-on-us-drug-charge.html&lt;/ref&gt; In trial, Suarez was convicted in Los Angeles with over 30 different charges on narcotics and drug trafficking, with 27 over charges related to money laundering, bank fraud, tax evasion and illegal exortation of monetary currency, to which he faced a life sentence in prison.&lt;ref name=taxevasion/&gt; On December 1990, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson sentenced Suarez to 30 years in prison, while his sister, Beatriz Asunta "Chunty" Roca was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-28/local/me-39865_1_drug-kingpin&lt;/ref&gt; He gave his first interview to the press on May 22, 2016. In the interview, Suarez has received political and criminal law diplomas after taking courses in prison.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eldeber.com.bo/bolivia/jorge-roca-suarez-techo-e.html&lt;/ref&gt; His family fortune and property in Santa Cruz has been seized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2160">In [[Egyptian culture]], a '''''khatba''''' ([[Arabic]]: ''خاطب'') is a (traditionally female) professional [[Mediation|mediator]] or [[broker]] of relationships, who is hired to help in finding a suitable marriage partner. Traditionally, a young person would make use of the services of a khatba when their family and friends were unable to find a suitable mate.&lt;ref name="citadel"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=im350ynEGzMC&amp;dq=khatba&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=Sex and the Citadel: Intimate Life in a Changing Arab World | publisher=Random House | author=El Feki, Shereen | year=2013 | pages=51 | isbn=978030790743 1 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their services are especially necessary outside of Egypt's large cities, in more traditional [[Islamic]] areas, where male and female youths are not permitted to mingle freely.&lt;ref name=adulthood&gt;{{cite book |last=Bentley |first=Evi |date=2007 |title=Adulthood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PhaCAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=khatba&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |publisher=Routledge |page=42 |isbn=9781134514755 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these areas, khatbas are typically paid for their services with non-monetary goods or services, such as gifts or favors.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite news |last=Shawky |first=Amany Aly |date=11 December 2012 |title=Make me a match: Egypt’s khatba tradition is still going strong |url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/make-me-match-egypt-s-khatba-tradition-still-going-strong |newspaper=Egypt Independent |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular media, khatbas are often represented as modestly-dressed middle-aged women, who carry photographs of marriageable youths to display to their clients.&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; Although they are considered a stereotypical figure of the 1940s to mid-1960s, many modern Egyptian youth still employ khatbas in one form or another.&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; As of 2013, less than one out of every hundred married Egyptian youth report meeting their partner through a khatba.&lt;ref name=citadel /&gt;

'''Krishna Kumar Mitra''' (1852-1936) was an [[Indian freedom fighter]], [[journalist]] and leader of the [[Brahmo Samaj]]. He is remembered for his contributions to the [[Swadeshi movement]] through his journal ''Sanjibani''.

== Early life and education ==
Krishna Kumar was born in the village of Baghil in the [[Mymensingh district]] of [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]] in what is today [[Bangladesh]] in 1852. He was a Hindu [[Kayastha]] by birth and his father Guruprasad Mitra was a landholder who led an agitation against oppression by British [[indigo]] planters.&lt;ref name="banglapedia"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mohanta |first=Sambaru Chandra |year=2012 |chapter=Mitra, Krishna Kumar |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mitra,_Krishna_Kumar |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishna Kumar was educated at [[Mymensingh|Mymensingh's]] Hardinge Vernacular School and the Zilla School and obtained a [[bachelor's degree]] from the [[Scottish Church College]] in 1876. Subsequently, he studied law at the [[University of Calcutta]] for a while.&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kopf |first=David |date=1979 |title=The Brahmo Samaj and the Shaping of the Modern Indian Mind |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUcY_IRKDHQC&amp;pg=PA100 |location=New Delhi |publisher=Archives Publishers |pages=100 |isbn=9780691031255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brahmo leader ==
Deeply influenced by his father who was a local Brahmo leader and his schoolteacher Girishchandra Ghosh, Krishna Kumar was inducted into the Brahmo faith in 1869 at the age of 17.&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt; He became a member of the [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]] and his journal ''Sanjibani'' became the Samaj's principal mouthpiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary And Index Of Proper Names In Sri Aurobindos Works|url=http://www.sriaurobindoashram.com/Content.aspx?ContentURL=_StaticContent/SriAurobindoAshram/-09%20E-Library/-01%20Works%20of%20Sri%20Aurobindo/-01%20English/-02_Other%20Editions/Glossaary%20and%20Index%20of%20Proper%20Names%20in%20Sri%20Aurobindos%20Works/-23_Glossary%20and%20Index%20Page%20274%20to%20289.htm|publisher=Sri Aurobindo Ashram|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected president of the [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kopf |first=David |date=1979 |title=The Brahmo Samaj and the Shaping of the Modern Indian Mind |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUcY_IRKDHQC&amp;pg=PA358 |location=New Delhi |publisher=Archives Publishers |pages=358 |isbn=9780691031255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career as a journalist ==
Mitra launched his [[Bengali language|Bengali]] journal ''Sanjibani'' in 1883. In 1886, he published a series of articles on the condition of the Indian workers in the [[Assam tea|tea plantations of Assam]] based on investigations by Dwaraknath Ganguly forcing the government to provide legal protection to tea garden workers.&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joshi|first=P.C.|title=Notes on the Bengal Renaissance|url=https://archive.org/stream/notesonthebengal035527mbp/notesonthebengal035527mbp_djvu.txt|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second floor of Mitra's 6, College Square residence served as the office and press for the journal. His nephew [[Aurobindo Ghosh]] stayed here during 1909-1910 before escaping to [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]].&lt;ref name="aurobindo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mitra Krishnakumar|url=http://www.aurobindo.ru/persons/00083_e.htm|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sriaurobindoashram"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Conversation with Sriman Aravinda Ghosh|journal=India|date=18 September 1909|url=http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/research/show.php?set=doclife&amp;id=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching career ==
Mitra taught at the [[Anandamohan College|AM Bose School and College]] (under the [[University of Calcutta]]) in [[Kolkata]] from 1879 to 1908 when he resigned from his post as superintendent and professor of history following the colonial government's threat to cancel the college's accreditation if he continued to be associated with the swadeshi movement.&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt;

== Political life ==
Mitra joined [[Surendranath Banerjee|Surendranath Banerjee's]] [[Indian Association]] in 1876 and became its joint secretary and Banerjee and Mitra traveled across [[northern India]] to popularise their political ideas. Mitra was also associated with the [[Indian National Congress]] since its inception and was part of its 'moderate' faction in Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandra|first=Bipan|title=Moder India|year=2000|publisher=NCERT|location=New Delhi|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 he joined the indigo cultivators' agitation.&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt;

== Swadeshi movement ==
Opposed to the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition of Bengal]] and influenced by colleagues like [[Ananda Mohan Bose]] and Kalishankar Shukul, Mitra joined the anti-Partition Swadeshi movement. He used his journal ''Sanjibani'' to rouse public opinion against the partition and on 13 July 1905 he openly called for the boycott of foreign goods through the journal. He attended the Bengal Provincial Conference at [[Barisal]] in 1906 where he condemned police atrocities against Swadeshi activists. The same year the Bengal government issued a circular banning the singing of ''[[Vande Mataram]]'' in any procession or public meeting. Mitra became president of the Anti-Circular Society that was formed to oppose the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Majumdar |first=A. K. Bas |date=1993 |title=Rabindranath Tagore: The Poet of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5Up306hrBIC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78 |location=New Delhi |publisher=Indus Publishing Company |pages=78 |isbn=9788185182926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his involvement in the Swadeshi movement, Mitra had to resign from his job as a professor of history and in 1908 was deported from Calcutta for two years by the British authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=INDIAN SEDITION.

== Family ==
Mitra married Lilabati Devi, the fourth daughter of [[Rajnarayan Basu]] in 1881. At their wedding, conducted in accordance with Brahmo rites, [[Narendranath Dutta]] sang two songs that were composed by [[Rabindranath Tagore]] for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kolkata Notebook|url=http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=409070&amp;catid=84|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=The Statesman|date=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mondal|first=Haripada|title=Rishi Rajnarayan Basu|url=http://www.midnapore.in/people/rishi_rajnarayan_basu.html|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitra was the maternal uncle of [[Aurobindo Ghosh]] and [[father in law]] of [[Sachindra Prasad Bose]] who unfurled the [[Calcutta Flag]] at the Parsi Bagan Square in Calcutta in 1906.&lt;ref name="aurobindo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sriaurobindoashram" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=K.V.|title=Our National Flag|year=1991|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information &amp; Broadcasting, Government of India|location=New Delhi|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social reformer ==
Krishna Kumar Mitra was a dedicated social reformer opposed to [[idolatry]], [[Caste system in India|caste system]] and the social and religious prejudices in Bengal. He formed a Nari Raksa Samiti to work for the protection of women's rights. He was also an advocate of [[temperance movement|temperance]] who strongly criticised the government's decision to establish public drinking houses.&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt;

== Books ==
Besides his journalistic pieces in the ''Sanjibani'', Mitra also authored several books including  ''Mahammad-Charita'', ''Buddhadev-Charita'' and ''Bauddhadharmer Sangksipta Bibaran''.&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt; He also wrote an autobiography, ''Krishna Kumar Mitrer Atma Charit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kopf |first=David |date=1979 |title=The Brahmo Samaj and the Shaping of the Modern Indian Mind |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUcY_IRKDHQC&amp;pg=PA378 |location=New Delhi |publisher=Archives Publishers |pages=378 |isbn=9780691031255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and commemoration ==
Krishna Kumar Mitra died in 1936. The [[Assamese language|Assamese]] writer [[Padmanath Gohain Baruah]] included a short biography of Mitra in his ''Nithikatha'' which he wrote as a textbook for school children to "show respect" to "a selfless patriot and deeply religious man [who] Through  Sanjibani, a paper which was run and edited by him, the bad luck of the tea garden coolies of Assam were slightly changed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Banerjee |first=Dipankar |date=2006 |title=Brahmo Samaj and North-East India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GE2o4QQV7UgC&amp;pg=PA112 |publisher=Anamika Publishers |location=New Delhi |pages=112 |isbn=9788179751763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran cites the story of the "people of [[Islamic view of Lot|Lot]]" destroyed by the [[Anger#Islam|wrath]] of [[God in Islam|God]] because they engaged in [[Lust#Islam|lustful]] [[carnal acts between men]]. [[Homosexual]] acts are [[Haram|forbidden]] in traditional [[Islamic jurisprudence]] and are liable to different punishments, including the [[Capital punishment in Islam|death penalty]], depending on the situation and [[Madhhab|legal school]]. However, [[homosexual relationships]] were generally tolerated in [[pre-modern Islamic societies]],&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;&lt;ref name="ia601301.us.archive.org"/&gt; and historical record suggests that these laws were invoked infrequently, mainly in cases of [[Rape in Islamic law|rape]] or other "exceptionally blatant infringement on [[Public morality|public morals]]".&lt;ref name=iranica-law/&gt; [[Homoerotic]] themes were cultivated in [[Islamic poetry|poetry]] and other [[Islamic literature|literary genres]] written in major languages of the [[Muslim world]] from the eighth century into the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Khaled El-Rouayheb |title=Before Homosexuality in the Arab-Islamic World 1500–1800 |pages=12 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ia601301.us.archive.org"/&gt; The conceptions of homosexuality found in classical Islamic texts resemble the traditions of [[Homosexuality in ancient Greece|Graeco]]-[[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|Roman antiquity]], rather than modern Western notions of [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name=iranica-law/&gt;&lt;ref name=ali-105/&gt; It was expected that many or most [[Islamic sexual jurisprudence#Puberty|mature]] men would be [[sexually attracted]] to both [[Bisexuality|women and male]] adolescents (variously defined), and men were expected to wish to play only an active role in  [[Human sexual activity#Homosexuality|homosexual intercourse]] once they reached adulthood.&lt;ref name=iranica-law/&gt;&lt;ref name=ali-105/&gt;

==Scripture and Islamic jurisprudence==

===In the Quran===

==== Messengers to Lot ====
[[File:Lot BnF Persan 54 fol. 40.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lot in Islam|Lut]] fleeing the [[Sodom and Gomorrah#Islamic|city]] with his [[Lot's daughters|daughters]]; his [[Lot's wife#Islamic view|wife]] is killed by a rock.]]
{{Main|Islamic view of Lot}}
The Quran contains several allusions to homosexual activity, which has prompted considerable [[Tafsir|exegetical]] and legal commentary over the centuries.&lt;ref name=EoQ&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Everett K. Rowson | year= 2006 | title=Homosexuality |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān|editor=Jane Dammen McAuliffe|publisher=Brill|volume=2|pages=444–445}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is most clearly addressed in the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah#Islamic|Sodom and Gomorrah]] (seven [[Ayah|verses]]) after the city inhabitants demand sexual access to the messengers sent by God to the prophet Lot (or Lut),.&lt;ref name=EoQ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(references 7:80–84, 11:77–83, 21:74, 22:43, 26:165–175, 27:56–59, and 29:27–33)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duran (1993) p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;Kligerman (2007) pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; The Quranic narrative largely conforms to that found in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref name=EoQ/&gt; In one passage the Quran says that the men "solicited his guests of him" ([[Quran 54:37]]), using an expression that parallels phrasing used to describe [[Potiphar and his wife|the attempted seduction]] of [[Joseph in Islam|Joseph]], and in multiple passages they are accused of "coming with lust" to men instead of [[Women in Islam|women]] (or their wives).&lt;ref name=EoQ/&gt; The Quran terms this an abomination ({{lang-ar|[[Wiktionary:فاحشة|فاحشة]]|fāḥiša}}) unprecedented in the history of the world:

{{quote|{{Cite quran|7|80 | end=  84
 | translator=s
 | tn=
 | expand=no
 | quote=And (We sent) Lot when he said to his people: What! do you commit an indecency which any one in the world has not done before you? Most surely you come to males in lust besides females; nay you are an extravagant people. And the answer of his people was no other than that they said: Turn them out of your town, surely they are a people who seek to purify (themselves). So We delivered him and his followers, except his wife; she was of those who remained behind. And We rained upon them a rain; consider then what was the end of the guilty.}}}}

Later exegetical literature built on these verses as writers attempted to give their own views as to what went on; and there was general agreement among exegetes that the "abomination" alluded to by the Quranic passages was attempted [[Sodomy#Islam|sodomy]] (specifically [[anal intercourse]]) between men.&lt;ref name=EoQ/&gt;

The sins of the people of Lut ({{lang-ar|[[wikt:لوط|لوط]]}}) subsequently became proverbial, and the [[Arabic]] words for the act of [[anal sex between men]] ({{lang-ar|[[wikt:لواط|لواط]]|liwāṭ}}) and for a person who performs such acts ({{lang-ar|[[wikt:لوطي|لوطي]]|lūṭi}}) ironically both derive from his name (even though Lut wasn't the one demanding sex).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wayne Dynes, ''Encyclopaedia of Homosexuality'', New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Zina'' verse ====
Only one passage in the Quran prescribes a strictly legal position. It is not restricted to homosexual behaviour, however, and deals more generally with ''[[zina]]'' ([[Islamic sexual jurisprudence#Illegal sex (fornication)|illicit sexual intercourse]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQuHFPKp8L0C&amp;pg=PA88|last=Wafer |first=Jim |chapter=Muhammad and Male Homosexuality |editor=Stephen O. Murray and Will Roscoe |title=Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History and Literature |page=88 |publisher=New York University Press |year=1997 |access-date=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|{{Cite quran|4|15 | end=  16
 | translator=s
 | tn=
 | expand=no
 | quote=And as for those who are guilty of an indecency from among your women, call to witnesses against them four (witnesses) from among you; then if they bear witness confine them to the houses until death takes them away or [[Allah]] opens some way for them (15). And as for the two who are guilty of indecency from among you, give them both a punishment; then if they repent and amend, turn aside from them; surely Allah is oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful. (16)}}}}

Most exegetes hold that these verses refer to illicit heterosexual relationships, although a minority view attributed to the [[Mu'tazilite]] scholar Abu Muslim al-Isfahani interpreted them as referring to homosexual relations. The second verse was taken to refer to homosexual intercourse by the early Quran exegesis of Mujahid; it is also the interpretation mentioned in Tafsir Ibn Kathir and Jalalayn.  

==== Cupbearers in paradise ====

Some Quranic verses describing the paradise refer to "immortal boys" (56:17, 76:19) or "young men" (52:24) who serve [[Wine#Islam|wine]] to the [[Blessing#Islam|blessed]]. Although the ''[[tafsir]]'' literature does not interpret this as a homoerotic allusion, the connection was made in other literary genres, mostly humorously.&lt;ref name=EoQ/&gt; For example, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]-era poet [[Abu Nuwas]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Homosexuality and Religion: An Encyclopedia|title=Islam|author=Elyse Semerdjian|page=132|editor=Jeffrey S. Siker|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
A beautiful lad came carrying the wine &lt;br /&gt;
With smooth hands and fingers dyed with henna &lt;br /&gt;
And with long hair of golden curls around his cheeks ... &lt;br /&gt;
I have a lad who is like the beautiful lads of paradise &lt;br /&gt;
And his eyes are big and beautiful}}

Jurists of the [[Hanafi]] school took up the question seriously, considering, but ultimately rejecting the suggestion that homosexual pleasures were, like wine, forbidden in this world but enjoyed in the [[Afterlife#Islam|afterlife]].&lt;ref name=EoQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=iranica-law/&gt;

=== In hadith and ''athar'' ===
The [[hadith]] (sayings and actions attributed to Muhammad) show that homosexual behaviour was not unknown in seventh-century [[Arabia]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"/&gt; However, given that the Quran did not specify the punishment of homosexual sodomy, Islamic jurists increasingly turned to several "more explicit but poorly attested"&lt;ref name=EoQ/&gt; hadiths in an attempt to find guidance on appropriate punishment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|year= 1983 | title=Liwāṭ |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill | editor-last = Bearman | editor-first = P.  | editor-last2 = Bianquis | editor-first2 = Th.  | editor-last3 = Bosworth | editor-first3 = C.E.  | editor-last4 = van Donzel  | editor-first4 = E.  | editor-last5 = Heinrichs | editor-first5 = W.P.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_4677|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are no reports relating to homosexuality in the best known hadith collections of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim]], other canonical collections record a number of condemnations of the "act of the people of Lot" (male-to-male [[anal intercourse]]).&lt;ref name=iranica-law/&gt; For example, Abu `Isa Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi (compiling the [[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]] around C.E.884) wrote that Muhammad had indeed prescribed the death penalty for both the [[Top, bottom and versatile#Top|active]] and also the [[Top, bottom and versatile#Bottom|passive]] partner:

{{quotation|Narrated by Abdullah ibn Abbas: The Prophet said: If you find anyone doing as Lot's people did, kill the one who does it, and the one to whom it is done.|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|38|4447}}, [https://muflihun.com/tirmidhi/15/1456 Al-Tirmidhi, 15:1456], [https://muflihun.com/ibnmajah/20/2561 Ibn Maajah, 20:2561]}}

{{quote|Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: If a man who is not married is seized committing sodomy he will be stoned to death.|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|38|4448}}}}

[[Abu-al-Faraj Ibn Al-Jawzi|Ibn al-Jawzi]] (1114–1200) writing in the 12th century claimed that Muhammad had cursed "sodomites" in several hadith, and had recommended the death penalty for both the active and passive partners in homosexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQuHFPKp8L0C&amp;pg=PA89|last=Wafer |first=Jim |chapter=Muhammad and Male Homosexuality |editor=Stephen O. Murray and Will Roscoe |title=Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History and Literature |page=89 |publisher=New York University Press |year=1997 |access-date=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbaas said: "The Prophet said: "... cursed is the one who does the action of the people of Lot."|Musnad Ahmad:1878}}

{{quote|Ahmad narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet of Allah said: "May Allah curse the one who does the action of the people of Lot, may Allah curse the one who does the action of the people of Lot," three times.|Musnad Ahmad: 2915}}

[[Al-Nuwayri]] (1272–1332) in his ''Nihaya'' reports that Muhammad is "alleged to have said what he feared most for his community were the practices of the people of Lot (although he seems to have expressed the same idea in regard to wine and female seduction)."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"/&gt;

The hadith collection of Bukhari (compiled in the 9th century from earlier [[oral tradition]]s) includes a report regarding ''[[mukhannathun]]'', [[effeminate]] men who were granted access to secluded women's quarters and engaged in other non-[[normative]] [[gender]] behavior:&lt;ref name=effeminates&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effeminates of Early Medina|author=Everett K.

In hadiths attributed to [[Muhammad's wives]], a ''mukhannath'' in question expressed his appreciation of a woman's body and described it for the benefit of another man. According to Everett Rowson, none of the sources state that Muhammad banished more than two ''mukhannathun'', and it is not clear to what extent the action was taken because of their breaking of gender rules in itself or because of the "perceived damage to social institutions from their activities as matchmakers and their corresponding access to women".&lt;ref name=effeminates/&gt;

=== Traditional Islamic law ===
According to traditional Islamic law, homosexual activity cannot occur in a legal manner because it takes place outside of [[Marriage in Islam|marriage]] and between partners of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Homosexuality|editor=John L.

The paucity of concrete prescriptions to be derived from hadith and the contradictory nature of information about the actions of early authorities resulted in lack of agreement among classical jurists as to how homosexual activity should be treated.&lt;ref name=iranica-law/&gt;&lt;ref name="ia601301.us.archive.org"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Everett K.

Since a ''[[hadd]]'' punishment for ''zina'' requires testimony from four witnesses to the actual act of penetration or a confession from the accused repeated four times, the legal criteria for the prescribed harsh punishments of homosexual acts were very difficult to fulfill.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;&lt;ref name="leaman" /&gt; The debates of classical jurists are "to a large extent theoretical, since homosexual relations have always been tolerated" in pre-modern Islamic societies.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; While it is difficult to ascertain to what extent the legal sanctions were enforced in different times and places, historical record suggests that the laws were invoked mainly in cases of rape or other "exceptionally blatant infringement on public morals".

===Modern interpretations of scripture and sharia===

In her 2016 book, [[Kecia Ali]] observes that "contemporary scholars disagree sharply about the Qur'anic perspective on same-sex intimacy." One scholar represents the conventional perspective by arguing that the Qur'an "is very explicit in its condemnation of homosexuality leaving scarcely any loophole for a theological accommodation of homosexuality in Islam." Another scholar argues that "the Qur'an does not address homosexuality or homosexuals explicitly." Overall, Ali says that "there is no one Muslim perspective on anything."&lt;ref&gt;Kecia Ali, ''Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence '' (Oneworld Publications, 2016), xvi, 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Muslim scholars have followed a "don't ask, don't tell" policy in regards to homosexuality in Islam, by treating the subject with passivity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mohamed El-Moctar El-Shinqiti, director of the Islamic Center of South Plains in Texas, has argued that "[even though] homosexuality is a grievous sin...[a] no legal punishment is stated in the Qur'an for homosexuality...[b] it is not reported that Prophet Muhammad has punished somebody for committing homosexuality...[c] there is no authentic hadith reported from the Prophet prescribing a punishment for the homosexuals..." Classical hadith scholars such as [[Al-Bukhari]], [[Yahya ibn Ma'in]], [[Al-Nasa'i]], [[Ibn Hazm]], [[Al-Tirmidhi]], and others have impugned the authenticity of hadith reporting these statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/crimes-and-penalties/disciplinary-penalties-tazir/176732.html |title=Threats to Behead Homosexuals: Shari`ah or Politics? - Disciplinary Penalties (ta`zir) - counsels |publisher=OnIslam.net |access-date=22 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302024245/http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/crimes-and-penalties/disciplinary-penalties-tazir/176732.html|archive-date=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faisal Kutty, a professor of Islamic law at Indiana-based [[Valparaiso University Law School]] and Toronto-based [[Osgoode Hall Law School]], commented on the contemporary same-sex marriage debate in a March 27, 2014, essay in the Huffington Post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/faisal-kutty-/gay-marriage_b_5044372.htmlurl|title= Why Gay Marriage May Not Be Contrary To Islam |publisher= Huffingtonpost.ca |access-date=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He acknowledged that while Islamic law iterations prohibits pre- and extra-marital as well as same-sex sexual activity, it does not attempt to "regulate feelings, emotions and urges, but only its translation into action that authorities had declared unlawful". Kutty, who teaches comparative law and legal reasoning, also wrote that many Islamic scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamppostproductions.com/the-homosexual-challenge-to-muslim-ethics/ |title= The Homosexual Challenge to Muslim Ethics |publisher= LamppostProductions.com |access-date=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; have "even argued that homosexual tendencies themselves were not haram [prohibited] but had to be suppressed for the public good".  He claimed that this may not be "what the LGBTQ community wants to hear", but that, "it reveals that even classical Islamic jurists struggled with this issue and had a more sophisticated attitude than many contemporary Muslims". Kutty, who in the past wrote in support of allowing Islamic principles in dispute resolution, also noted that "most Muslims have no problem extending full human rights to those—even Muslims—who live together 'in sin'".  He argued that it therefore seems hypocritical to deny fundamental rights to same-sex couples. Moreover, he concurred with Islamic legal scholar Mohamed Fadel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islawmix.org/election2012/samesex.html |title= On Same-Sex Marriage |publisher= Islawmix.org |access-date=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in arguing that this is not about changing Islamic marriage (nikah), but about making "sure that all citizens have access to the same kinds of public benefits".

Islamist journalist [[Muhammad Jalal Kishk]] found no prescribed punishment for homosexuality in Islamic law&lt;ref&gt;''A Muslim's Thoughts about the Sexual Question'', (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref name=massad&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMnMC1vlxVMC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;lpg=PA204&amp;dq=kishk+boys&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bWJVK9RERQ&amp;sig=zCuzjTGqWPf1g77-JTPmqUy316I#PPA203,M1 |title=Desiring Arabs |first=Joseph Andoni |last=Massad|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=2007|pages=203–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several modern day scholars, including Scott Kugle, argue for a different interpretation of the Lot narrative focusing not on the sexual act but on the infidelity of the tribe and their rejection of Lot's Prophethood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kugle|first=Scott|title=Homosexuality in Islam|year=2010|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford, England|pages=42–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2003 book Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle asserts "that
Islam does not address homosexuality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mesas.emory.edu/home/people/faculty/kugle.html|title=Scott Kugle|author=|date=|work=Emory.edu|access-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, he adds that we should be "suspicious of statements like 'Islam says . . .' or 'The Shari'ah says . . .' as if these abstractions actually speak."  Whatever is said about these sources  "are interpretations of them" and interpretations are "always by fallible people." Fugle reads the Qur'an as holding "a positive assessment of diversity." With this reading, Islam can be described as "a religion that positively assesses diversity in creation and in human societies."195 In keeping with this positive assessment of diversity, "gay and lesbian Muslims" view homosexuality as representing the "natural diversity in sexuality in human societies."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle,  "Sexuality, diversity and ethics in the agenda of progressive Muslims" in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi (Oneworld Publications, 2003), 194-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle's 2010 book on homosexuality in Islam, he addresses the teaching of sacred texts including the Qur'an about homosexuality. Kugle notes the Islamic "tolerance for diversity of interpretation of sacred texts."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, ''Homosexuality in Islam: Critical Reflection on Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Muslims'' (Oneworld Publications, 2010), vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kugle quotes the Qur'an: "O people, we created you all from a male and a female And made you into different communities and tribes So that you would come to know one another Acknowledging that the most noble among you Is the one most aware of God." Qur'an 49:13 (Kugle's translation). Then Kugle continues, "the implication of this verse is that no Muslim is better than another," even "a gay or lesbian Muslim."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, ''Homosexuality in Islam: Critical Reflection on Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Muslims'' (Oneworld Publications, 2010), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding interpreting the Qur'an, Kugle notes that "it is always human beings who speak for the Qur'an" and "they always interpret its words" and "interpretation is always ambiguous and contested." Such ambiguity allows "gay, lesbian, and transgender Muslims" to interpret the Qur'an in "sexuality-sensitive" ways, ways they believe produce a "fuller and better interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, ''Homosexuality in Islam: Critical Reflection on Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Muslims'' (Oneworld Publications, 2010), Ch. 2 in unpaginated Ebook.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the Qur'an's treatment of same-sex acts, Kugle says that "where the Qur'an treats same-sex acts, it condemns them only so far as they are exploitive or violent." More generally, Kugle notes that the Qur'an refers to four different levels of personality. One level is "genetic inheritance." The Qur'an refers to this level as one's "physical stamp" that "determines one's temperamental nature" including one's sexuality. One the basis of this reading of the Qur'an, Kugle asserts that homosexuality is "caused by divine will," so "homosexuals have no rational choice in their internal disposition to be attracted to same-sex mates."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, ''Homosexuality in Islam: Critical Reflection on Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Muslims'' (Oneworld Publications, 2010), 2, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the story of Lot, Kugle observes that if the "classical interpreters" had seen "sexual orientation as an integral aspect of human personality," they would have read the narrative of Lot and his tribe "as addressing male rape of men in particular" and not as "addressing homosexuality in general."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, ''Homosexuality in Islam: Critical Reflection on Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Muslims'' (Oneworld Publications, 2010), 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

A critique of Kugle's approach, interpretations and conclusions was published in 2016 by Mobeen Vaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muslimmatters.org/2016/07/11/can-islam-accommodate-homosexual-acts-quranic-revisionism-and-the-case-of-scott-kugle/|title=Can Islam Accommodate Homosexual Acts?

In a 2012 book, Aisha Geissinger&lt;ref&gt;https://carleton.ca/religion/people/aisha-geissinger/ Aisha Geissinger&lt;/ref&gt; writes that there are "apparently irreconcilable Muslim standpoints on same-sex desires and acts," all of which claim "interpretative authenticity." One of these standpoints results from "queer-friendly" interpretations of the Lot story and the Quran. The Lot story is interpreted as condemning "rape and inhospitality rather than today's consensual same-sex relationships."&lt;ref&gt;Aisha Geissinger, "Islam and Discourses of Same-Sex Desire" in ''Queer Religion, Volume 1'', eds., Donald L. Boisvert and Jay Emerson Johnson (ABC-CLIO, 2012), 70. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdessamad Dialmy&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merip.org/author/abdessamad-dialmy Abdessamad Dialmy&lt;/ref&gt; in his 2010 article, "Sexuality and Islam," addressed "sexual norms defined by the sacred texts (Koran and Sunna)." He wrote that "sexual standards in Islam are paradoxical." The sacred texts "allow and actually are an enticement to the exercise of sexuality."  However, they also "discriminate . . . between heterosexuality and homosexuality." Islam's paradoxical standards result in "the current back and forth swing of sexual practices between repression and openness." Dialmy sees a solution to this back and forth swing by a "reinterpretation of repressive holy texts."&lt;ref&gt;''The European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care'' (June 15, 2010 (3):160-8. Abstract) .&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of homosexuality in Islamic societies==
Societies in Islam have recognized "both erotic attraction and sexual behavior between members of the same sex." However, their attitudes about them have often been contradictory: "severe religious and legal sanctions" against homosexual behavior and at the same time "celebratory expressions" of erotic attraction.&lt;ref name="ia601301.us.archive.org"/&gt; [[Homoeroticism]] was idealized in the form of [[Homoerotic poetry|poetry]] or artistic declarations of love from one man to another. Accordingly, the Arabic language had an appreciable vocabulary of homoerotic terms, with a dozens of word just to describe types of [[male prostitutes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Boswell|title=Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-MR5_AdG68C&amp;pg=PA195|date=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=|pages=195–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmitt (1992) identifies some twenty words in Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]] and Turkish to identify those who are penetrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Will Roscoe et al.

===Pre-modern era===

There is little evidence of homosexual practice in Islamic societies for the first century and a half of the Islamic era.&lt;ref name=iranica-law/&gt; Homoerotic poetry appears suddenly at the end of the 8th century CE, particularly in Baghdad in the work of [[Abu Nuwas]] (756-814), who became a master of all the contemporary genres of Arabic poetry.&lt;ref name=iranica-law/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Editors |first=The |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Abu-Nuwas |title=Abu Nuwas &amp;#124; Persian poet |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |access-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous author [[Jahiz]] tried to explain the abrupt change in attitudes toward homosexuality after the [[Abbasid Revolution]] by the arrival of the Abbasid army from [[Khurasan]], who are said to have consoled themselves with male pages when they were forbidden to take their wives with them.&lt;ref name=iranica-law/&gt; The increased prosperity following the early conquests was accompanied by a "corruption of morals" in the two holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], and it can be inferred that homosexual practice became more widespread during this time as a result of acculturation to foreign customs, such as the music and dance practiced by ''[[mukhannathun]]'', who were mostly foreign in origin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"/&gt; The Abbasid ruler [[Al-Amin]] (809-813) was said to have required slave women to be dressed in masculine clothing so he could be persuaded to have sex with them, and a broader fashion for ''ghulamiyyat'' (boy-like girls) is reflected in literature of the period.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"/&gt;

During the early period, growth of a beard was considered to be the conventional age when an adolescent lost his homoerotic appeal, as evidenced by poetic protestations that the author still found his lover beautiful despite the growing beard. During later periods, the age of the stereotypical beloved became more ambiguous, and this prototype was often represented in Persian poetry by Turkish soldiers.&lt;ref name=iranica-law/&gt; This trend is illustrated by the story of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (971–1030), the ruler of the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]], and his cupbearer [[Malik Ayaz]].&lt;ref name=iranica-law/&gt; Their relationship, which was sketchily attested in contemporary sources, became a staple of Persian literature comparable to the story of [[Layla and Majnun]].&lt;ref name=iranica-law/&gt; Poets used it to illustrate the power of love, pointing to Mahmud as an example of a man who becomes "a slave to his slave", while Malik Ayaz served as "the embodiment of the ideal beloved, and a model for purity in Sufi literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Neill, James|year=2008|title=The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations In Human Societies|publisher=McFarland|page=308|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;pg=PA308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ritter | first=Hellmut | title=Handbook of Oriental studies: Near and Middle East |volume=69 |publisher=Brill |year=2003 |pages=309–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other famous examples of homosexuality include the [[Aghlabid]] [[Emir]] [[Ibrahim II of Ifriqiya]] (ruled 875–902), who was said to have been surrounded by some sixty [[catamite]]s, yet whom he was said to have treated in a most horrific manner. [[Caliph]] [[al-Mutasim]] in the 9th century and some of his successors were accused of homosexuality. The popular stories say that [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Cordoba]], [[Abd al-Rahman III]] had executed a young man from [[León, Spain|León]] who was held as a hostage, because he had refused his advances during the [[Reconquista]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"/&gt;

[[Mehmed the Conqueror]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[sultan]] living in the 15th century, European sources say "who was known to have ambivalent sexual tastes, sent a eunuch to the house of Notaras, demanding that he supply his good-looking fourteen-year-old son for the Sultan's pleasure. When he refused, the Sultan instantly ordered the decapitation of Notaras, together with that of his son and his son-in-law; and their three heads … were placed on the banqueting table before him".&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries'', pp. 115–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Another youth Mehmed found attractive, and who was presumably more accommodating, was [[Radu III the Fair]], the brother of the famous [[Vlad the Impaler]], "Radu, a hostage in Istanbul whose good looks had caught the Sultan's fancy, and who was thus singled out to serve as one of his most favored pages." After the defeat of Vlad, Mehmed placed Radu on the throne of [[Wallachia]] as a vassal ruler. However, Turkish sources deny these stories.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Ottoman Empire'', Mohamed Farid Bey&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever the legal strictures on sexual activity, the positive expression of male homeoerotic sentiment in literature was accepted, and assiduously cultivated, from the late eighth century until modern times. First in [[Arabic]], but later also in Persian, Turkish and [[Urdu]], love poetry by men about boys more than competed with that about women, it overwhelmed it. Anecdotal literature reinforces this impression of general societal acceptance of the public celebration of male-male love (which hostile Western caricatures of Islamic societies in medieval and early modern times simply exaggerate).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World'', MacMillan Reference USA, 2004, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Shah Abbas and Wine Boy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]] of Iran with a [[page (servant)|page]] (1627).]]

European travellers remarked on the taste that [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]] of Iran (1588-1629) had for wine and festivities, but also for attractive [[page (servant)|pages]] and cup-bearers. A painting by Riza Abbasi with homo-erotic qualities shows the ruler enjoying such delights.&lt;ref&gt;Welch A., "Worldly and Otherworldly Love in Safavi Painting", Persian Painting from the Mongols to the Qajars, Éditions R.

"Homosexuality was a key symbolic issue throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in [Islamic] [[Iberia]]. As was customary everywhere until the nineteenth century, homosexuality was not viewed as a congenital disposition or 'identity'; the focus was on nonprocreative sexual practices, of which sodomy was the most controversial." For example, in "[[al-Andalus]] homosexual pleasures were much indulged by the intellectual and political elite. Evidence includes the behavior of rulers . . . who kept male harems."&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/deisenbe/Enc_of_Medieval_Iberia/homosexuality.pdf Daniel Eisenberg, “Homosexuality” in ''Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. Michael Gerli (Routledge, 2003), 398.]&lt;/ref&gt; Although early islamic writings such as the Quran expressed a mildly negative attitude towards homosexuality, laypersons usually apprehended the idea with indifference, if not admiration. Few literary works displayed hostility towards non-heterosexuality, apart from partisan statements and debates about types of love (which also occurred in heterosexual contexts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-MR5_AdG68C&amp;pg=PA195|title=Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century|first=John|last=Boswell|date=15 February 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|access-date=5 April 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khaled el-Rouayheb (2014) maintain that "much if not most of the extant love poetry of the period [16th to 18th century] is pederastic in tone, portraying an adult male poet's passionate love for a teenage boy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dalacoura |first=Katerina |last2= |first2= |date=2014 |title=Homosexuality as cultural battleground in the Middle East: culture and postcolonial international theory|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/56822/1/Homosexuality_Middle%20East.pdf |journal=Third World Quarterly |publisher= |volume= |issue= |page=4|doi= 10.1080/01436597.2014.926119|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El-Rouayheb suggest that even though religious scholars considered sodomy as an abhorrent sin, most of them did not genuinely believe that it was illicit to merely fall in love with a boy or expressing this love via poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/56822/1/Homosexuality_Middle%20East.pdf|title=Katerina Dalacoura (2014) p.4|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the secular society however, a male's desire to penetrate a desirable youth was seen as understandable, even if not lawful.&lt;ref&gt;Kecia Ali, ''Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence '' (Oneworld Publications, 2016), 105.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, men adopting the passive role were more subjected to stigma. The medical term ''ubnah'' qualified the pathological desire of a male to exclusively be on the receiving end of anal intercourse.

===Modern era===

The Ottoman Caliphate "ruled the Sunni Muslim world for centuries." It was "much more open-minded regarding the homosexual issue" than is the current Turkish government although it "claims to emulate" the Ottoman Caliphate. "The Ottoman Empire had an extensive literature of homosexual romance, and an accepted social category of transvestites." It could be argued that the Ottoman sultans "were social liberals compared with the contemporary Islamists of Turkey, let alone the Arab World."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/opinion/mustafa-akyol-what-does-islam-say-about-being-gay.html?_r=1 “What Islam Says About Being Gay?” ''The New York Times'' (July 28, 2015). Retrieved October 11, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Ottoman Empire]], homosexuality was decriminalized in 1858, as part of wider reforms during the [[Tanzimat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/oct/07/ottoman-empire-secular-history-sharia|title=The Ottoman empire's secular history undermines sharia claims|author=Tehmina Kazi|newspaper=UK Guardian|date=7 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faith-matters.org/images/stories/fm-publications/the-tanzimat-final-web.pdf|title=The Tanzimat: Secular Reforms in the Ottoman Empire|author=Ishtiaq Hussain|publisher=Faith Matters|date=15 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the modern era, Islamic nations were not so opposed to same-sex relations. For example, a ruler in [[Persia]] in the 11th century advised his son "to alternate his partners seasonally: young men in the summer and women in the winter." Many eighth-century love poems by [[Abu Nuwas]] in [[Baghdad]] and by other Persian and [[Urdu poetry|Urdu poets]] seem to have been "addressed to boys." In mystic writings of the medieval era, such as [[Sufi texts]], it is "unclear whether the beloved being addressed is a teenage boy or God." European chroniclers censured "the indulgent attitudes to gay sex in the Caliphs' courts."&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

The modern rejection and criminalization of  "homosexuality in Islam gained momentum through the exogenous effects of European colonialism. . . . " European thought at the time treated homosexuality as "against nature."&lt;ref&gt;Tilo Beckers, "Islam and the Acceptance of Homosexuality," in ''Islam and Homosexuality, Volume 1'', ed. Samar Habib, 64-65  (Praeger, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle has argued that, while "Muslims commemorate the early days of Islam when they were oppressed as a marginalized few," many of them now forget their history and fail to protect "Muslims who are gay, transgender and lesbian."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, ''Living Out Islam: Voices of Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Muslims'' (NYU Press, 2013), 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pederasty===
{{Main|Pederasty}}
[[File:Lining up to use a boy.jpg|thumb|upright|Ottoman illustration depicting a young man used for group sex (from ''Sawaqub al-Manaquib''), 19th century]]

While friendship between men and boys is often described in sexual ways in classical Islamic literature, Khaled El-Rouayheb and Oliver Leaman have argued that it would be misleading to conclude from this that homosexuality was widespread in practice.&lt;ref name="leaman"/&gt; Such literature tended to use transgressive motifs alluding to what is forbidden, in particular homosexuality and wine.&lt;ref name="leaman"/&gt; Greek homoerotic motifs may have accurately described practices in ancient Greece, but in their Islamic adaptations they tended to play a satirical or metaphorical rather than descriptive role.&lt;ref name="leaman"/&gt; At the same time, many miniatures, especially from Ottoman Turkey, contain explicit depictions of pederasty, suggesting that the practice enjoyed a certain degree of popularity.&lt;ref name="leaman"/&gt; A number of pre-modern texts discuss the possibility of sexual exploitation faced by young boys in educational institutions and warn teachers to take precautions against it.&lt;ref name="leaman"/&gt;

In modern times, despite the formal disapproval of religious authority, the segregation of women in Muslim societies and the strong emphasis on male virility leads adolescent males and unmarried young men to seek sexual outlets with boys younger than themselves—in one study in Morocco, with boys in the age-range 7 to 13.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt&amp;Sofer, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; Men have sex with other males so long as they are the penetrators and their partners are boys, or in some cases [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] men.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt&amp;Sofer, pp.x-xi&lt;/ref&gt;

''Liwat'' can therefore be regarded as "temptation",&lt;ref&gt;Habib, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; and anal intercourse is not seen as repulsively unnatural so much as dangerously attractive. They believe "one has to avoid getting buggered precisely in order not to acquire a taste for it and thus become addicted."&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kw_BVSVmNsUC&amp;dq=Sexuality+and+eroticism+among+males+in+Moslem+societies&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2K5mS8aYJo2TkAXGuKntDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Arno Schmitt, Jehoeda Sofer, "Sexuality and Eroticism among Males in Muslim Societies" (The Haworth Press, 1992) p.8 |publisher=Books.google.com.au |access-date=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all sodomy is homosexual: one Moroccan sociologist, in a study of sex education in his native country,  notes that for many young men heterosexual sodomy is considered better than vaginal penetration, and female prostitutes likewise report the demand for anal penetration from their (male) clients.&lt;ref&gt;Dialmy, pp. 32 and 35, footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not so much the penetration as the enjoyment that is considered bad.&lt;ref name="Schmitt&amp;Sofer, p.7"&gt;Schmitt&amp;Sofer, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Deep shame attaches to the passive partner: "for this reason men stop getting laid at the age of 15 or 16 and 'forget' that they ever allowed it earlier." Similar sexual sociologies are reported for other Muslim societies from North Africa to Pakistan and the Far East.&lt;ref name="Murray&amp;Roscoe, passim"&gt;Murray&amp;Roscoe, passim&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Afghanistan]] in 2009, the [[British Army]] was forced to commission a report into the sexuality of the local men after British soldiers reported the discomfort at witnessing [[pederasty|adult males involved in sexual relations with boys]]. The report stated that though illegal, there was a tradition of such relationships in the country, known as ''[[Bacha bazi|bache bazi]]'' or "boy play", and that it was especially strong around North Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Qobil |first=Rustam |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11217772 |title=The sexually abused dancing boys of Afghanistan - BBC News |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date= |access-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iraq, homosexuality is allowed by the government, but terrorist groups often carry out illegal executions of gay people. [[Saddam Hussein]] was "unbothered by sexual mores." Ali Hili reports that "since the 2003 invasion more than 700 people have been killed because of their sexuality." He calls Iraq the "most dangerous place in the world for sexual minorities."&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

In [[Jordan]], where homosexuality is legal, "gay hangouts have been raided or closed on bogus charges, such as serving alcohol illegally."&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

In [[Pakistan]], [[Law of Pakistan|its law]] is a mixture of both Anglo-Saxon colonial law as well as Islamic law, both which proscribe criminal penalties for same-sex sexual acts. The [[Pakistan Penal Code]] of 1860, originally developed [[History of Pakistan#British colonization, conquest, and cultural heritage|under colonialism]], punishes sodomy with a possible prison sentence and has other provisions that impact the human rights of LGBT Pakistanis, under the guise of protecting public morality and order. Yet, the more likely situation for gay and bisexual men is sporadic police blackmail, harassment, fines, and jail sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html |title=Pakistan Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860) |publisher=Pakistani.org |date= |access-date=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 there was a gay party in the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] town of [[Ksar el-Kebir|al-Qasr al-Kabir]]. Rumours spread that this was a gay marriage and more than 600 people took to the streets, condemning the alleged event and protesting against leniency towards homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=27 November 2007|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2007/11/27/42200.html|title=Al Arabiya: "Moroccan "bride" detained for gay wedding"|work=alarabiya.net|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several persons who attended the party were detained and eventually six Moroccan men were sentenced to between four and ten months in prison for "homosexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=12 December 2007|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2007/12/12/42868.html|title=Al Arabiya: "Morocco sentences gay 'bride' to jail"|work=alarabiya.net|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion among Muslims==

In 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights, which was followed up with a report from the UN Human Rights Commission documenting violations of the rights of LGBT people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/17/un-gay-rights-protection-resolution-passes-_n_879032.html |date=June 17, 2011 |agency=Associated Press |first=Frank |last=Jordans |title=U.N.

The Muslim community as a whole, worldwide, has become polarized on the subject of homosexuality. Some Muslims say that "no good Muslim can be gay," and "traditional schools of Islamic law consider homosexuality a grave sin." At the opposite pole, "some Muslims . . . are welcoming what they see as an opening within their communities to address anti-gay attitudes." Especially, it is "young Muslims" who are "increasingly speaking out in support of gay rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religionnews.com/2016/06/17/muslim-attitudes-about-lbgt-are-complex-and-far-from-universally-anti-gay/|title=Muslim attitudes about LBGT are complex|author=|date=|work=ReligionNews.com|access-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion polls===
In 2013, the [[Pew Research Center]] conducted a study on the global acceptance of homosexuality and found a widespread rejection of homosexuality in many nations that are predominantly Muslim. In some countries, views were becoming more conservative among younger people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/ Pew Research Center: The Global Divide on Homosexuality], retrieved 9 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

*American Muslims - in line with general public attitudes in the United States - have become much more accepting of homosexuality over recent years. In a 2007 poll conducted by Pew Research Center, only 27% of American Muslims believed that homosexuality should be accepted. In a 2011 poll, that rose to 39%. In a July 2017 poll, Muslims who say homosexuality should be accepted by society clearly outnumber those who say it should be discouraged (52% versus 33%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Muslims Concerned About Their Place in Society, but Continue to Believe in the American Dream|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/findings-from-pew-research-centers-2017-survey-of-us-muslims/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=2 August 2017|date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslims leaders opposing same-sex relations===
====Sunni====
* In 2017, the Egyptian cleric, Sheikh [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] (who has served as chairman of the [[European Council for Fatwa and Research]]) was asked how gay people should be punished. He replied that "there is disagreement," but "the important thing is to treat this act as a crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/islams-jihad-against-homosexuals-1465859170|title=Islam's Jihad Against Homosexuals|first=Ayaan Hirsi|last=Ali|date=13 June 2016|publisher=|access-date=5 April 2017|via=www.WSJ.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shia====
* Iran's current Supreme Leader, Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]] has stated that "There is no worst form of moral degeneration than [homosexuality]. ... But it won't stop here. In the future, not sure exactly when, they will legalize incest and even worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.outrightinternational.org/content/irans-supreme-leader-says-there-no-worst-form-moral-degeneration-homosexuality|title=IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER SAYS "THERE IS NO WORST FORM OF MORAL DEGENERATION THAN HOMOSEXUALITY"|author=|date=|work=Outrightinternational.org|access-date=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohammad Javad Larijani]], Khamenei's close adviser, stated "In our society, homosexuality is regarded as an illness and malady," whilst adding "Promoting homosexuality is illegal and we have strong laws against it," Larijani said, according to the conservative news website Khabaronline. He added, "It [homosexuality] is considered as a norm in the West and they are forcing us to accept it.

* Ayatollah [[Ali al-Sistani]] in [[Iraq]] has stated "It is not permissible for a man to look at another man with lust; similarly, it is not permissible for a woman to look at another woman with lust.

[[File:Al-Fatiha Muslim Gays - Gay Parade 2008 in San Francisco (2626954534).jpg|thumb|left|Members of ''Al Fatiha'' at the LGBT Pride parade in San Francisco 2008.]]
The [[Al-Fatiha Foundation]] was an organization which tried to advance the cause of gay, lesbian, and transgender Muslims. It was founded in 1998 by [[Faisal Alam]], a [[Pakistani American]], and was registered as a [[nonprofit]] organization in the [[United States]]. The organization was an offshoot of an internet [[listserve]] that brought together many gay, lesbian and questioning Muslims from various countries.&lt;ref&gt;"Cyber Mecca", The Advocate, March 14, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verification needed|date=May 2016}} The Foundation accepted and considered homosexuality as natural, either regarding Qur'anic verses as obsolete in the context of modern society, or stating that the Qu'ran speaks out against homosexual lust and is silent on homosexual love. After the Alam stepped down, subsequent leaders failed to sustain the organization and it began a process of legal dissolution in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimalliance.org |title=Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity |publisher=Muslimalliance.org |date= |access-date=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary inline|date=May 2016}}

In 2001, [[Al-Muhajiroun]], a banned and now defunct international organization who sought the establishment of a global Islamic [[caliphate]], issued a [[fatwa]] declaring that all members of Al-Fatiha were ''[[murtadd]]'', or [[apostates]], and condemning them to death. Because of the threat and coming from conservative societies, many members of the foundation's site still prefer to be anonymous so as to protect their identity while continuing a tradition of secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Herbert, "Queer chronicles",  Weekend Australian, October 7, 2006, Qld Review Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Fatiha has fourteen chapters in the [[United States]], as well as offices in [[England]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], and [[South Africa]]. In addition, [[Imaan (organization)|Imaan]], a social support group for Muslim LGBT people and their families, exists in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imaan.org.uk/ |title=Home |publisher=Imaan.org.uk |access-date=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary inline|date=May 2016}} Both of these groups were founded by gay [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] activists.

She described the MASGD as supporting "LGBT Muslims who want or need to embrace both their sexual and religious identities." Haidar said that the support the MASGD provides is needed because a person who is "Muslim and queer " faces "two different systems of oppression": [[Islamophobia]] and [[homophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/20/what-you-should-know-about-being-lgbt-and-muslim-from-a-leading-lgbt-muslim-group/|title=What you should know about being LGBT and Muslim, from a leading LGBT Muslim group|author=|date=|work=WashingtonPost.com|access-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books supporting LGBT Muslims===
This section contains material from books and articles supporting LGBT Muslims.

====Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism====
In Chapter Eight of the 2003 book, ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', [http://mesas.emory.edu/home/people/faculty/kugle.html Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle] asserts "that Islam does not address homosexuality." In Fugle's reading, the Qur'an holds "a positive assessment of diversity." It "respects diversity in physical appearance, constitution, stature, and color of human beings as a natural consequence of Divine wisdom in creation." Therefore, Islam can be described as "a religion that positively assesses diversity in creation and in human societies." Furthermore, in Kugle's reading, the Qur'an "implies that some people are different in their sexual desires than others." Thus, homosexuality can be seen as part of the "natural diversity in sexuality in human societies." This is the way "gay and lesbian Muslims" view their homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://othersheepexecsite.com/Other_Sheep_Resource_Sexuality_Diversity_and_Ethics_in_the_Agenda_of_Progressive_Muslims_by_Scott_Siraj_al_Haqq_Kugle.pdf Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, “Sexuality, diversity and ethics in the agenda of progressive Muslims” in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi (Oneworld Publications, 2003), 194-196.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Qur'an, Kugle refers to the benediction of [[Imam Al-Ghazali]] (the 11th-century Muslim theologian) which says. "praise be to God, the marvels of whose creation are not subject to the arrows of accident." For Kugle, this benediction implies that "if sexuality is inherent in a person's personality, then sexual diversity is a part of creation, which is never accidental but is always marvelous." Kugle also refers to "a rich archive of same-sex sexual desires and expressions, written by or reported about respected members of society: literati, educated elites, and religious scholars." Given these writings, Kugle concludes that "one might consider Islamic societies (like classical Greece) to provide a vivid illustration of a 'homosexual-friendly' environment." This evoked from "medieval and early modern Christian Europeans" accusations that Muslim were "engaging openly in same-sex practices."&lt;ref&gt;[http://othersheepexecsite.com/Other_Sheep_Resource_Sexuality_Diversity_and_Ethics_in_the_Agenda_of_Progressive_Muslims_by_Scott_Siraj_al_Haqq_Kugle.pdf Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle,  “Sexuality, diversity and ethics in the agenda of progressive Muslims” in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi (Oneworld Publications, 2003), 198.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kugle goes a step further in his argument and asserts that "if some Muslims find it necessary to deny that sexual diversity is part of the natural created world, then the burden of proof rests on their shoulders to illustrate their denial from the Qur'anic discourse itself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://othersheepexecsite.com/Other_Sheep_Resource_Sexuality_Diversity_and_Ethics_in_the_Agenda_of_Progressive_Muslims_by_Scott_Siraj_al_Haqq_Kugle.pdf Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, “Sexuality, diversity and ethics in the agenda of progressive Muslims” in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi (Oneworld Publications, 2003), 196, 198.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam and Homosexuality====
In 2010, an anthology ''Islam and Homosexuality'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;Samar Habib, ''Islam and Homosexuality'' (Praeger, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In the Forward, [[Parvez Sharma]] sounded a pessimistic note about the future: "In my lifetime I do not see Islam drafting a uniform edict that homosexuality is permissible." Following is material from two chapters dealing with the present.

Rusmir Musić in a chapter "Queer Visions of Islam" said that "Queer Muslims struggle daily to reconcile their sexuality and their faith." Musić began to study in college "whether or not my love for somebody of the same gender disgusts God and whether it will propel me to hell. The answer, for me, is an unequivocal ''no''. Furthermore, Musić wrote, "my research and reflection helped me to imagine my sexuality as a gift from a loving, not hateful, God."&lt;ref&gt;Rusmir Musić, "Queer Visions of Islam" in ''Islam and Homosexuality'', ed. Samar Habib, (Praeger, 2010), pp. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marhuq Fatima Khan in a chapter "Queer, American, and Muslim: Cultivating Identities and Communities of Affirmation," says that "Queer Muslims employ a few narratives to enable them to reconcile their religious and sexual identities." They "fall into three broad categories: (1) God Is Merciful; (2) That Is Just Who I Am; and (3) It's Not Just Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Marhuq Fatima Khan, "Queer, American, and Muslim: Cultivating Identities and Communities of Affirmation" in ''Islam and Homosexuality'', ed. Samar Habib, (Praeger, 2010), 356-358.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual Ethics and Islam====
[[Kecia Ali]] in her 2016 book ''Sexual Ethics and Islam'' says that p xvi "there is no one Muslim perspective on anything." Regarding the Qur'an, Ali says that modern scholars disagree about what it says about "same-sex intimacy." Some scholars argue that "the Qur'an does not address homosexuality or homosexuals explicitly."&lt;ref&gt;Kecia Ali, ''Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence '' (Oneworld Publications, Exp Rev edition 2016), xvi, 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding homosexuality, Ali, says that the belief that "exclusively homosexual desire is innate in some individuals" has been adopted "even among some relatively conservative Western Muslim thinkers."100 Homosexual Muslims believe their homosexuality to be innate and view "their sexual orientation as God-given and immutable."123 She observes that  "queer and trans people are sometimes treated as defective or deviant," and she adds that it is "vital not to assume that variation implies imperfection or disability."&lt;ref&gt;Kecia Ali, ''Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence '' (Oneworld Publications, Exp Rev edition 2016), 100, 123, 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding "medieval Muslim culture," Ali says that "male desire to penetrate desirable youth . . . was perfectly normal." Even if same-sex relations were not lawful, there was "an unwillingness to seek out and condemn instances of same-sex activity, but rather to let them pass by . . . unpunished."&lt;ref&gt;Kecia Ali, ''Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence '' (Oneworld Publications, Exp Rev edition 2016), 105-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article "Same-sex Sexual Activity and Lesbian and Bisexual Women" Ali elaborates on homosexuality as an aspect of medieval Muslim culture. She says that "same-sex sexual expression has been a more or less recognized aspect of Muslim societies for many centuries." There are many explicit discussions of "same-sex sexual activity" in medieval Arabic literature.&lt;ref name="brandeis.edu"&gt;[https://www.brandeis.edu/projects/fse/muslim/same-sex.html Kecia Ali, “Same-sex Sexual Activity and Lesbian and Bisexual Women.”] Accessed October 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender variant and transgender people==
[[File:Hijra Protest Islamabad.jpg|thumb|200px|A group of ''[[Hijra (South Asia)|hijras]]'' and transgender people protest in [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]].]]

In Islam, the term [[mukhannathun]] is used to describe gender-variant people, usually male-to-female transgender.  Neither this term nor the equivalent for "eunuch" occurs in the Quran, but the term does appear in the Hadith, the sayings of Muhammad, which have a secondary status to the central text.  Moreover, within [[Islam]], there is a tradition on the elaboration and refinement of extended religious doctrines through scholarship.  This doctrine contains a passage by the scholar and hadith collector [[An-Nawawi]]:

{{quote|A mukhannath is the one ("male") who carries in his movements, in his appearance and in his language the characteristics of a woman. There are two types; the first is the one in whom these characteristics are innate, he did not put them on by himself, and therein is no guilt, no blame and no shame, as long as he does not perform any (illicit) act or exploit it for money (prostitution etc.). The second type acts like a woman out of immoral purposes and he is the sinner and blameworthy.&lt;ref name="TEOEM"&gt;{{cite journal

While Iran has outlawed homosexuality, Iranian [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] thinkers such as [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] have allowed for transgender people to change their sex so that they can enter heterosexual relationships. This position has been confirmed by the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]], and is also supported by many other Iranian clerics.

Iran carries out more sex change operations than any other nation in the world except for [[Thailand]]. It is regarded as a cure for homosexuality, which is punishable by death under Iranian law. The government even provides up to half the cost for those needing financial assistance and a sex change is recognized on the birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barford |first=Vanessa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7259057.stm |title=Iran's 'diagnosed transsexuals' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-02-25 |access-date=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 26th of June 2016, clerics affiliated to the [[Pakistan]]-based organization Tanzeem Ittehad-i-Ummat issued a [[fatwa]] on transgender people where a transwoman (born male) with [[transgender marriage|"visible signs of being a woman" are allowed to marry a man]], and  a transman (born female) with "visible signs of being a man" are allowed to marry a woman. Muslim ritual funerals also apply. Depriving transgender people of their inheritance, humiliating, insulting or teasing them were also declared [[haraam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2016/06/clerics-issue-fatwa-allowing-transgender-marriage-in-pakistan/ |title=Clerics issue fatwa allowing transgender marriage in Pakistan |publisher=Samaa Web Desk |date=27 June 2016 |access-date=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9232">'''La Marcha Por La Humanidad''' (also known as the '''Chicano Mural''' at UH) is a [[mural]] housed at the University&amp;nbsp;Center on the campus of the [[University of Houston]].  In 1973 artists Mario Gonzales and Ruben Reyna, both Vietnam veterans, created and painted the mural on behalf of the university's chapter of the [[Mexican American Youth Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Alyson|title=UH mural comes front and center|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/article/UH-mural-comes-front-and-center-5131996.php#/0|work=Houston Chronicle|publisher=Hearst}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mural depicts the political angst of the [[Chicano Movement]], featuring [[Uncle Sam]] with a skull in place of a head, an effect popular in twentieth-century [[Mexican art|Mexican]] and [[Chicano art movement|Chicano]] art.  It is twelve by sixty five feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramirez|first=Marisa|title=UH Moment: "Chicano Mural"|url=http://app1.kuhf.org/articles/1328301067-UH-Moment-Chicano-Mural.html|work=KUHF|publisher=KUHF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==
"The left side of the mural features images of Aztecs, farmers (campesinos) and images of Mexico's history, painted by Reyna, -Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, Father Miguel Hidalgo, Benito Juarez, [[Emiliano Zapata]], [[Pancho Villa]] and the power of the Catholic Church. On the right side of the mural, Gonzales painted images of historical figures of the 60s and 70s—[[Cesar Chavez]], [[Alicia Escalante]], [[Reies Lopez Tijerina]], and a sea of people demanding change," explains a [[KUHF]] article. The article continues with an explanation by Ruben Reyna, one of the artists. "'I painted the left section of the mural and Mario painted the right and we met in the middle, which is the future of the [[Chicano]],' Reyna said. 'We painted the past, the history of [[Mexico]], our beginnings from the days of the [[Spaniard]] conquest of the [[Spaniards|Aztecas]]. We brought it to the far right (of the mural) and identified some key figures of the [[Chicano movement]].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramirez|first=Marisa|title=UH Moment: "Chicano Mural"|url=http://app1.kuhf.org/articles/1328301067-UH-Moment-Chicano-Mural.html|work=KUHF|publisher=KUHF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one portion of the mural, lady justice is depicted holding an unbalanced scale,defining the inequality of justice in America. However, the central portion of the mural is perhaps the most iconographic. Gonzalez states that the young man in the middle of the mural has reached the step stones of success, where he is confronted by his conscience, which is "Tlatelolco, [[Tenochtitlan]]" and all the history of his ancestors. He is also embraced by his government, which is depicted as the skeletal figure in [[Uncle Sam]] garb. The young man is faced with a choice of what to make of his life, his education and accomplishments. Will he think of just himself or help make a change in society.
In conclusion, the theme is for all humans regardless of race or color, should attempt to 
change the world to create a more unified and humane society.
An invitation is extended to all the students, who are the force
that can make a change in the world. They are encouraged to: "Don’t forget their roots, work for the well being and for the prosperity of not just the Hispanics but of the entire world." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cortez|first=Mimi|title=Dia Delivery: Saving the 1973 Chicano Mural at University of Houston|url=http://www.mcbntv.com/live/|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=Mi Casa Broadcasting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1995 Threat==
In 1995 the University Center Policy Board proposed the removal of the mural, as part of an effort to change the theme of the University Center.  Hispanic Student Association President Russell Contreras spearheaded efforts to encourage Chicano students to attend a policy board meeting in favor of preserving the mural.  He mentions that these were not the first efforts to have the mural removed.  A coalition of students wrote a letter to the editor of the campus newspaper, the Daily Cougar.  Many administrators were in favor of moving the mural, which is painted on a scroll and attached to the wall.  In the end, student protests prevailed and the mural was not moved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ellis|first=Jessoca|title=SI OR NO?

==2012 Threat and resolution==
In December 2011, while a major renovation to the University Center was about to begin, the [[University of Houston]] refused to give written assurances to activists and alumna indicating that the mural would be preserved and displayed in the remodeled University Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rohr|first=Monica|title=UH renovation could threaten Chicano mural|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/UH-renovation-could-threaten-Chicano-mural-2408706.php|work=Houston Chronicle|publisher=Hearst}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the university offered the possibility of digitizing an image of the piece. Contributing to alumna and student concerns was the fact that the year before several murals had been whitewashed at [[Texas Southern University School of Law|TSU]], a university about one mile away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marmaduke|first=Lauren|title=Oops! TSU To Spend $50,000 Restoring Murals It Destroyed|url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/artattack/2010/09/oops_tsu_to_spend_50000_restor.php|work=Houston Press Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests, press conferences and petitions were quickly organized.

In January 2012 the [[University of Houston]] formally agreed to preserve the [[mural]] and to prominently feature the mural in the University Center's new building design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haider|first=Mohammed Haider|title=UH to preserve artwork|url=http://thedailycougar.com/2012/01/19/uh-to-preserve-artwork|work=Daily Cougar|publisher=University of Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diana Gutierrez, a student at the university, did a great deal of campus organizing on behalf of the mural. She did an interview with Mi Casa Broadcasting, explaining her thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cortez|first=Mimi|title=Dia Delivery: Saving the 1973 Chicano Mural at University of Houston|url=http://www.mcbntv.com/live/|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=Mi Casa Broadcasting}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Lorenzo Cano, Associate Dean for the Center for Mexican American Studies, was involved in the original efforts to have the mural painted.  In at least one interview, he spoke about the murals significance, commenting that when he was enrolled, the Chicano community was not represented very well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Emery|first=Mike|title=Iconic Mural Now Part of New UH Bookstore|url=http://www.uh.edu/news-events/stories/2014/January/0109Mural.php|work=Daily Cougar|publisher=University of Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the university had committed to preserving the mural, one of the original artists, Mario Gonzalez, who had been working with the coalition, decided to cease communication with the coalition, in favor of seeking a contract to expand the mural. On January 13, 2014 Mr. Gonzalez stated to the campus newspaper that he wanted to add a section entitled "En Las Manos De Dios," or "In the Hands of God," reflecting his greater interest in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gillespie|first=Laura|title=Artist protests declined mural extension|url=http://thedailycougar.com/2014/01/13/artist-protests-declined-mural-extension/|work=The Daily Cougar|publisher=University of Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt; The System-wide Art Acquisition Committee denied his request to expand the mural and is now in charge of caring for the mural.

On January 28, 2014 the University of Houston unveiled the restored piece, which is now on display in the [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] student bookstore, located in the University Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Emery|first=Mike|title=Iconic Mural Now Part of New UH Bookstore|url=http://www.uh.edu/news-events/stories/2014/January/0109Mural.php|work=Daily Cougar|publisher=University of Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance beyond university==
The Chicano Mural movement has been recognized internationally as a significant cultural contribution.  The Texas State Historical Commission mentions that the Chicano Mural Movement of the 1960s and 70's helped to affirm cultural identity and to challenge racism.  The association's website chronicles many murals which were removed or painted over due to controversial themes.  Many fell into poor conditions due to their location on exterior walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paloma Acosta|first=Teresa|title=Chicano Mural Movement|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kjc03|work=website|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mural seems to be one which has withstood challenges to its message, and may be one of the best preserved murals of the period due to its location indoors as well as recent preservation efforts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8100">'''Labor market segmentation''' is the division of the labor market according to a principle such as occupation, geography and industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-labourmarketsegmentation.html|title=labour-market segmentation – Dictionary definition of labour-market segmentation {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

One type of segmentation is to define groups "with little or no crossover capability", such that members of one segment cannot easily join another segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.economyprofessor.com/economictheories/segmented-labor-market-theory.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418140610/http://www.economyprofessor.com/economictheories/segmented-labor-market-theory.php |archive-date=2008-04-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in different segments, for example men and women, receiving different wages for the same work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmedia.com/new/Lips-Hilary-gender-wage-gap.shtml|title=The Gender Wage Gap: Debunking the Rationalizations|last=Lips|first=Hilary M.|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214043349/http://www.womensmedia.com/new/Lips-Hilary-gender-wage-gap.shtml|archivedate=2009-02-14|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2009-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19th-century Irish political economist [[John Elliott Cairnes]] referred to this phenomenon as that of "noncompeting groups". 

A related concept is that of a [[dual labour market]] (DLM), that splits the aggregate labor market between a primary sector and a secondary sector.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Neoclassical economics ==
The theory of labor market segmentation contrasts with [[neo-classical economic theory]], which posits the existence of a unified market for labor, consisting of buyers and sellers in open competition.{{Cn|date=September 2018}} The labor market thus functions as do other markets. In this model, the difference between different workers' wages and conditions arise from individual differences in their [[human capital]] (skills, experience, or formal education) or tastes. On the latter, as part of the theory of [[compensating wage differentials]], those who prefer risky or dirty jobs receive higher compensation than those who take safe or clean ones. Put another way, differences in compensation for labor arise only on the supply side.

The theory of labor market segmentation posits that differences on the demand side imply differences in compensation that are not explained by individual worker characteristics. Labor markets are not [[Perfect competition|perfect markets]]. Non-market institutions such as [[craft unions]] and [[professional associations]] affect employer strategies, producing different results for workers with similar characteristics.  

All workers should be subject to the same employment standards, such as minimum wages, maximum hour laws, occupational safety, security and health laws, regardless of sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5--Q49vuNxUC}}|title=Labor Markets and Integrating National Economies|last=Ehrenberg|first=Ronald G.|date=2000-08-21|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=|isbn=0815791410|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
Modern labor market segmentation theory arose in the early 1960s. It changed the view of many economists who had seen the [[labor market]] as a market of individuals with different characteristics of e.g., education and motivation. This perspective was intended to help explain the demand-side of the market, and the nature and strategy of employers. The idea of non-competing groups developed under the general label of labor market segmentation theory. The theory emerged in the United States

== Theory ==
The market segmentation model was developed to accommodate the differences in job markets. For example, lawyers and fashion designers work in different markets. Such markets arise from the division of labor, increasing differentiation and specialization. These workers are unable to switch between occupations because they require different skills and investment in training and qualifications. For example, nurses and doctors form separate occupational labor markets even though they work side by side in the same organizations. 

Geographical labor markets emerge because of the costs and disruption workers incur in changing locations. As a result, wages for the same work can remain higher in some locations than others. Conversely, employers would incur costs and disruption if they attempted to relocate to an area of lower labor costs, and might experience increases in non-labor expenses. Cultural differences such as preferences for leisure time versus work may follow geography.

Geographical segmentation also occurs on a global basis, specifically between developed and less-dedeveloped countries. However, when labor migrates to developed countries, migrants tend to remain within their original segment, receiving less compensation than native workers.{{sfn|Bauder|2006}} One study found that [[neoliberal]] globalization had expanded labor market segmentation. It found that in the West, nations import capital, consumer goods and services exported by countries in the rest of the world, where lower wage workers produce the exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asimakopoulos|first=John|date=1 March 2009|title=Globally Segmented Labor Markets: The Coming of the Greatest Boom and Bust, Without the Boom|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0896920508099191|journal=Critical Sociology|publisher=|volume=35|issue=2|pages=175–198|doi=10.1177/0896920508099191|via=SAGE Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sectors ===
One important segmentation is primary/secondary.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Labor Market Segmentation -- Notes|url = http://myweb.lmu.edu/jdevine/notes/LaborMarketSegm.html|website = myweb.lmu.edu|access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two markets allow limited movement between them. The concepts of primary and secondary labor markets have now passed into conventional thought.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

====Primary sector====
In a primary sector the workforce receives significant wages and benefits. The job market consists of a majority of [[blue collar]] and [[White-collar worker|white collar]] jobs. The primary sector generally contains the higher-grade, higher-status, and better-paid jobs, with employers who offer the best terms and conditions. The primary sector is sometimes sub-divided into an upper and lower level. 

====Secondary sector====
Secondary sector jobs are mostly low-skilled, require relatively little training, and can be learned relatively quickly on the job. Many such jobs feature high turnover, and/or variable demand. Employers are reluctant to invest in such workers, via advanced training or other employee development activities. Wages are low, and the terms and conditions of the job are less favorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/235451/Fields+note_jun06.pdf|title=Fields + note|website=info.worldbank.org|access-date=2018-09-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920234734/http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/235451/Fields+note_jun06.pdf|archive-date=2018-09-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two key formulations are labor market theory and internal labor market theory. The labor market segmentation theory revolves around the identification of a split between two analytic divisions in the economy and the labor market.

'''Labor unrest''' is [[strike action]] or [[industrial action]] undertaken by [[labor union]]s, especially where [[:Category:Labor disputes|labor disputes]] become [[Violence in industrial disputes|violent]]. Such a conception of labor action was common in the [[United States]] in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnesen|first=Eric|title=Encyclopedia of United States Labor and Working-class History|year=2007|publisher=CRC Press|pages=123|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zEWsZ81Bd3YC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=labor+dispute+american+history#v=onepage&amp;q=labor%20dispute%20american%20history&amp;f=false|isbn=9780415968263}}&lt;/ref&gt; most prominently among [[mining|mining interests]] in the [[American West]], and remained common in the 20th century among [[Communism|communist]] states, such as the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''Mazayen al-Ibl''', also known as the '''King Abdel Aziz Festival''' and sometimes referred to as '''Miss Camel''', is a [[beauty pageant]] for [[camel]]s put on by the [[Qahtanite|Qahtani]] tribe of [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="france"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://observers.france24.com/content/20100218-saudi-arabia-miss-camel-contestants-accused-fame-seeking | title=Saudi Arabia's "Miss Camel" contestants accused of fame seeking | work=France24 | date=February 18, 2010 | accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is held in [[Guwei'iyya]] yearly. In 2007, 250 owners participated, showing a total of more than 1,500 camels. Participants come from every Gulf country except [[Oman]], and from every region of Saudi Arabia except the south-western mountain region, where there are no camel breeders.&lt;ref name="france" /&gt; The competition is held in respect to the role of camels in [[Bedouin]] history, and to preserve [[pure breed|purebred]] camel strains.&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt;

Four varieties of camel participate in the show: the majaheem, which is black; the maghateer, which is white; the shi'l, which is dark brown; and the sufur, which is beige with black shoulders.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/04/27/us-saudi-camels-beauty-odd-idUSKUA74812720070427 | title=Saudi tribe holds camel beauty pageant | publisher=Reuters | date=April 27, 2007 | accessdate=August 15, 2013 | author=Hammond, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is strict health testing and veterinarians present at the event.&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt; The event is supported by the King and Crown Prince Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=2008111722223 | title=Mesh’al: Camel contest continues | publisher=Saudi Gazette | accessdate=August 15, 2013 | author=Al-Oraifij, Abdullah | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130815043830/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=2008111722223 | archivedate=August 15, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prizes are awarded to the most beautiful camels in four categories based on the number of camels entered by the owner: groups of 100, 50, 10, and individual camels. The beauty of the camel is based on the "size of its head; whether its lips cover its teeth, the length of its neck and the roundness of its hump"&lt;ref name="france" /&gt; and "big eyes, long lashes and a long neck."&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1581950/Saudi-breeders-search-for-new-Miss-Camel.html | title=Saudi breeders search for new 'Miss Camel' | work=The Telegraph | date=March 17, 2008 | accessdate=May 16, 2015 | author=McElroy, Damien}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The nose should be long and droop down, that's more beautiful [...] The ears should stand back, and the neck should be long.

'''National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Національне Антикорупційне Бюро України}}, ''НАБУ'') or '''NABU''' is a [[Ukrainian Government|Ukrainian]] [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] [[anti-corruption agency]] which investigates [[corruption in Ukraine]] and prepares cases for prosecution.&lt;ref name="Chornovol5514"/&gt; It has investigatory powers but cannot indict suspects.&lt;ref name=pmt15816/&gt; Only agency findings passed to the [[Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office]] become a part of criminal case.&lt;ref name=pmt15816/&gt;

The agency was established in 2014 after its predecessor, the National Anti-Corruption Committee ({{lang-uk|Національний антикорупційний комітет}}) was considered a failure.&lt;ref name=GTNCIU&gt;[http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/864275.shtml Ukraine to set up anti-corruption bureau], [[Global Times]] (6 June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The bureau was created on the request of the [[International Monetary Fund]].

The agency is set to employ 700 people.&lt;ref name=kp14515acbU/&gt; Its first 70 detectives started work on 1 October 2015.&lt;ref name="Oct. 1, 2015 acbuw"&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/reform-watch-oct-1-2015-399175.html Reform Watch - Oct. 1, 2015], [[Kyiv Post]] (Oct. 2, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency's government funding is mandated under American and European Union aid programs.&lt;ref name=pmt15816/&gt; It has an evidence-sharing agreement with the [[F.B.I.]].&lt;ref name=pmt15816&gt;[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html Secret Ledger in Ukraine Lists Cash for Donald Trump’s Campaign Chief], [[The New York Times]] (15 August 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ukrainian government also employs the National Agency for Prevention of Corruption which works to prevent corruption by monitoring government officials' [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]].&lt;ref name=KP141211&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/parliament-adopted-yatsenyuks-ambitious-reform-program-for-2015-374823.html Parliament adopts Yatsenyuk’s ambitious reform program for 2015], [[Kyiv Post]] (Dec. 11, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== National Anti-Corruption Committee ===
The position of Commissioner for anti-corruption policy was established by the [[second Tymoshenko Government]] on 24 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/410-2009-%D0%BF Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine decree], [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]] (24 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Its first meeting took place on 22 April 2010; at the time most of its members were government officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/yanukovych-confirms-membership-of-anti-corruption--62832.html Yanukovych confirms membership of anti-corruption committee], [[Kyiv Post]] (30 March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011 then [[President of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] became head of the National Anti-Corruption Committee, while the [[Ukrainian Ministry of Justice|Justice Minister]] served as the secretary of the committee.&lt;ref name=CorruNo&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/112862/ Yanukovych vows to put an end to corruption], [[Kyiv Post]] (September 15, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CorruNo2&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/112046/ Yanukovych approves instruction on National Anti-Corruption Committee], [[Kyiv Post]] (September 1, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the committee was tasked to give systematic analysis and to develop measures to combat corruption.&lt;ref name=CorruNo2/&gt;

=== Commissioner for anti-corruption policy ===

6 March 2014 [[Tetiana Chornovol]] become the Commissioner for anti-corruption policy.&lt;ref name=TCETV6314&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://espreso.tv/news/2014/03/06/chornovol_pryznachyly_upovnovazhenym_z_antykorupciynoyi_polityky Chornovol appointed commissioner of anti-corruption policy], [[Espreso TV]] (6 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the organization was set to employ 1,200 people in seven regional offices.&lt;ref name="Chornovol5514"&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/chornovol-a-lot-of-work-ahead-for-ukraines-corruption-fighters-346344.html Chornovol: A lot of work ahead for Ukraine's corruption fighters], [[Kyiv Post]] (5 May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Chornovol resigned on 18 August 2014 because "there is no political will in Ukraine to carry out a hard-edged, large-scale war against corruption".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv-post-plus/yarema-top-prosecutor-since-june-accused-of-stalling-criminal-cases-367925.html Yarema, top prosecutor since June, accused of stalling criminal cases], [[Kyiv Post]] (Oct. 14, 2014)&lt;br&gt;[https://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/governmental-commissioner-for-combating-corruption-chornovol-resigns-361062.html Governmental commissioner for combating corruption Chornovol resigns]". Kyiv Post. 18 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Corruption Bureau===
Founding and launching the National Anti-Corruption Bureau was one of the requirements set by the IMF and the European Commission for relaxation of visa restrictions between Ukraine and the European Union.

On 14 October 2014 Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted the Law "On the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine".

In January 2015 for the first time in history of modern Ukraine an open competition for position of director of a state agency was announced. 186 candidates applied for the position of Director of the National Anti-corruption Bureau of Ukraine. The winner of the competition was Artem Sytnyk.

On 16 April 2015 the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed two decrees: № 217/2015 – decree on founding the National Anti-corruption Bureau of Ukraine and №218/2015 — decree on appointing Artem Sytnyk the Bureau's Director. This provided a starting point for a new state agency. The first order signed by the NABU Director on 23 April 2015 approved the Bureau's structure and stuffing. On 24 April Gizo Uglava was appointed First Deputy Director. Later two more Deputy Directors were appointed: Anatoly Novak and Tetyana Varvarska.

On 7 May the Bureau was given premises At 3 Vasylya Surykova street, Kiev.

On 30 November 2015 the competition for the position of the Head of the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office, on which the start of the NABU work depended, was over. Nazar Kholodnitskiy took the position.
On 4 December the NABU detectives entered the first three criminal proceedings concerning the theft of state owned companies' funds to the value of 1 billion UAH into the Unified Register of Pre-Trial Investigations.

The agency's detectives underwent training sponsored by the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="Oct. 1, 2015 acbuw"/&gt;

From June 2017 the NABU Director is a member of the [[European Union Anti-Corruption Initiative in Ukraine|EUACI]]'s Steering Committee. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau is one of the beneficiarys this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nabu.gov.ua/en/novyny/support-international-partners-very-important-nabu-artem-sytnyk-0 |title=Support of international partners is very important for the NABU — Artem Sytnyk |author= |date=23 June 2017 |website= |publisher=National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=2018-05-13 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with other anti-corruption bodies ==

NABU is one of three anti-corruption pillar institutions in Ukraine, created after the Euromaidan revolution.

=== National Agency for Prevention of Corruption ===
The [[National Agency for Prevention of Corruption]] seeks to 'shapes and implements anti-corruption policy while creating an environment conducive to corruption prevention'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ua.undp.org/content/dam/ukraine/docs/nazk_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While NABU focuses on law-enforcement, the NACP shapes policy and develops regulations that help prevent corruption and ensures compliance.

It is responsible for verifying the accuracy of government officials' asset and income declarations.&lt;ref name=KP141211/&gt; In July 2016, its civil society representative, Rouslan Riaboshapka, criticised the hiring process, saying that the agency was choosing the lowest-scoring candidates.&lt;ref name=KP160608&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.kyivpost.com/article/opinion/op-ed/oleg-sukhov-reformer-and-anti-reformer-of-the-week-july-7-418122.html |title= Oleg Sukhov: Reformer and anti-reformer of the week July 7 |first= Oleg |last= Sukhov |work= Kyiv Post |date= 8 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office ===

The [[Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office]] (SAPO) supports and oversees criminal investigations launched by NABU, by drawing up indictments and bringing them before the courts.

==Control over the bureau==
The direct control over the bureau is conducted by the parliamentary committee on issues of fighting organized crime and corruption.

The NABU director
* informs the President, Verkhovna Rada, and the Cabinet about key issues in operation of the NABU and its regional centers, about execution of assigned tasks, compliance with the law, rights and freedoms of individuals;
* every year in February and August submits a written report to the President, Verkhovna Rada, and the Cabinet about operations of the NABU during the previous six months.

==Background==
In the 1970s fishermen from declining fishing towns along the Galician coastline turned to the more lucrative occupation of importing [[contraband]] cigarettes from the [[United States]]; At that time the sole manufacturer of cigarettes in Spain was [[Tabacalera]], a monopolistic state-owned company.

The topography of the [[Ría de Arosa|Arousan]] coastline, dotted with coves and inlets, allowed these {{lang|es|tabaqueros}} to bring in the contraband under the cover of darkness and from there distribute it throughout Spain. In the 1980s, the [[Medellín cartel]], under pressure from the US authorities and a saturated North American cocaine market turned to Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/cocaine-fleets-bring-wealth-and-death-to-the-end-of-the-earth-1353969.html|last= Nash|first=Elizabeth|title=Cocaine fleets bring wealth and death to the end of the earth|publisher=The Independent|date=1996-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the smugglers utilized the methods developed in the previous decade to import [[hashish]], and later [[cocaine]] for the cartels. From the town of [[Vilagarcía de Arousa]] - the main distribution point for the smugglers - Colombian traffickers from Madrid would collect the drugs and distribute them throughout the rest of Spain.

===Investigation===
The investigation into the international trafficking of drugs through Galicia was prompted by a letter sent in August 1989 by Ricardo Portabales Rodríguez, a drug dealer serving a prison sentence, to [[Luciano Varela]], an investigating magistrate of [[Pontevedra (province)|Pontevedra]]'s provincial court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/politica/noticias/20100410/53903260968/el-instructor-de-la-causa-contra-garzon-fue-su-presentador-oficial-en-galicia-en-los-90-garzon-balta.html|title=El instructor de la causa contra Garzón fue su 'presentador oficial' en Galicia en los 90|publisher=La Vanguardia|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[inquisitorial system]] used in [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] required further investigation by an [[investigating magistrate]]. Varela deemed the case to be too big for a provincial court to investigate so it was transferred to the ''[[Audiencia Nacional]]'', Spain's highest criminal court. A 35-year-old magistrate in [[Baltasar Garzón]] was charged with carrying out the investigation. The investigation was carried out with the assistance of Section IV of the Central Narcotics Department ({{lang|es|Servicio Central de Estupefacientes}}). Garzón used testimony from two [[informants]] known in the media as {{lang|es|los arrepentidos}} (The penitents): the aforementioned Ricardo Portabales Rodríguez and Manuel Fernández Padín, an actual member of one of the ''clans'', to build the case against the traffickers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laopinioncoruna.es/galicia/2009/06/13/19-anos-operacion-necora/295318.html|last=Foces|first=U|title=19 años de la ´operación Nécora´|trans-title=19 years on from Operation Nécora|publisher=laopinióncoruña.es|date=2009-06-13|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Mago==
On the morning of June 12, 1990 a hundred vehicles containing 350 officers from the Central Narcotics Department, flown in specifically from [[Madrid]] to prevent any possible leaks from the local police force, left the main police station in the Galician capital, [[Santiago de Compostela]], heading for the ''[[comarca]]'' of [[O Salnés]]. From there, each vehicle went on to their pre-assigned targets in different towns throughout the ''comarca''. The operation was initially known as ''Operación Mago'' (Operation [[Biblical Magi|Magi]]) - Garzón was told that they had named it after himself; however, he rejected this name and they settled on ''Operación Necora''.  
 
The base of operations was Vilagarcía de Arousa's police station, the former local party headquarters of the [[Falange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/hemeroteca/2006/06/11/100000097485.shtml|title=La Nécora no estaba tan vacía|publisher=La Voz de Galicia|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was carried out under the judicial supervision of Baltsar Garzón, Luciano Varela and [[Javier Zaragoza]], the deputy anti-drug prosecutor.

==Trial==
On September 6, 1990 the Anti-drug prosecutor presented an indictment against 49 of those arrested (Indictment 13/90). Of the remaining five, the prosecutor's office started a separate proceeding against three: Marcial Dorado Baúnde "Marcial de la Isla", Michel Haengi and Miguel Rivero González on the grounds of [[money-laundering]] - something that would delay the start of the main trial. Luis Falcon Pérez "Falconetti" and Tomás Leis Carlés were released on bail, however, they remained imprisoned on unrelated charges.

'''Rusyns in Pannonia''', or simply '''''Rusyns''''' or '''''Ruthenians''''' ([[Pannonian Rusyn language|Rusyn]]: Руснаци or Русини, [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Русини/''Rusini'', [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Rusini''), are a regional minority subgroup of the [[Rusyns]], an [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] peoples. They are located in the [[Central Europe]]an region of [[Pannonia]], which today covers almost all of [[Hungary]], the southern-most parts of [[Slovakia]], northeast [[Croatia]], a tiny sliver portion of northeast [[Slovenia]], and the northern-most part of [[Serbia]] ([[Vojvodina]]).

They are also considered to be related to the northern Carpathian Rusyns (Carpathian Ruthenians) who live in [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] (mostly in [[Ukraine]] and [[Slovakia]], but also in [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Czech Republic]] and [[Hungary]]).

==Demographics==
Rusyns in Pannonia mostly live in the autonomous province of [[Vojvodina]] in [[Serbia]]. There are 14,246 declared ethnic Rusyns in [[Serbia]] (2011 census). The village of [[Ruski Krstur]] in the [[Kula (Vojvodina)|Kula]] municipality is the cultural centre of the Pannonian Rusyns. There is a considerable concentration of Rusyns in [[Novi Sad]], where in 1820 the construction of [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|St. Peter and Paul]] [[Greek Catholic]] [[parish church]] started and was subsequently completed in 1834/1837. Other villages with a Rusyn majority include [[Kucura]] in the [[Vrbas (city)|Vrbas]] municipality, and [[Bikić Do]] in the [[Šid]] municipality. There are Pannonian Rusyn communities in [[Slavonia]] ([[Croatia]]), forming a majority in the village of [[Petrovci, Croatia|Petrovci]], [[Bogdanovci]] municipality, in [[Vukovar-Srijem county]].

==History==
The population of [[Banat]] and [[Bačka]] was decimated in the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]]. Rusyns emigrated to today's Banat and Bačka regions alongside [[Germans]], [[Hungarians]] and [[Slovaks]] from a region that, in modern times, comprises parts of eastern [[Slovakia]] and northwestern [[Hungary]]. This was part of an intensive colonization by the Austrian Empire of the region's rich, arable land, aimed at increasing state revenue through taxes.

The census of [[Kula (Serbia)|Kula]] municipality from 1746 shows for the first time three Rusyns &amp;mdash; Janko and Petro Homa and Janko Makovicki.

The official date of Rusyn settlement in Vojvodina is January 17, 1751 when the administrator of Bačka Franc Josip de Redl signed a contract with Mihajlo Munkači from the village of Červenovo, in the county of [[Bereg (county)|Bereg]], to bring 200 Rusyn families of [[Greek-Catholic]] rite from the upper [[Hungary|Hungarian]] districts known as the "Upper-Land" (Горнїца) to [[Ruski Krstur|Kerestur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ruskikerestur.com/Anglijski/OkerestureAnglijski.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422082420/http://www.ruskikerestur.com/Anglijski/OkerestureAnglijski.htm |archivedate=2008-04-22 |df= }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; Kerestur was a [[Serb]]ian settlement mentioned 1741 as ruined and abandoned, as the settlers had moved to [[Čelarevo]]. The same administrator signed another contract on May 15, 1763 with Petro Kiš from Kerestur to bring 150 Rusyn families of Greek Catholic rite from the same areas in the "Upper-Land" to [[Kucura|Kocur]].

As the population grew and arable land given to settlers by contract was limited, many families from Kerestur and Kocur decided to migrate to the town of [[Novi Sad]] in 1766 and 1767. Later, Rusyns settled in [[Šid]] and [[Vajska]], and in the early 19th century in [[Vukovar]] and [[Ilok]], now in modern-day [[Croatia]]. In [[Petrovci, Croatia|Petrovci]], also Croatia, Rusyns started settlement in 1833, and later in [[Bačinci]] in 1834.

The census from 1767 for the whole Bač-Bodroš county (which then was part of Habsburg Monarchy and today comprises Bačka region in Serbia and Hungary) shows about 2.000 Rusyns. The census from 1991 in the same area shows about 25.000 Rusyns. Currently, the number of Panonian Rusyns declines and is estimated to be about 15.000. The main reason for this is the increased number of Rusyns who decided to move to [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blic.rs/reportaza.php?id=81230 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306230621/http://www.blic.rs/reportaza.php?id=81230 |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Rusyns are officially recognized as an autochthonous national minority in Croatia and, as such, they elect a special representative to the [[Croatian Parliament]], shared with members of eleven other national minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=1874 | language = Croatian | publisher = Croatian Parliament | title = Pravo pripadnika nacionalnih manjina u Republici Hrvatskoj na zastupljenost u Hrvatskom saboru | work = Zakon o izborima zastupnika u Hrvatski sabor | accessdate = 2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Pannonian Rusyns consider [[Pannonian Rusyn language|their Rusyn variety]] to be a distinct language.

Rusyn is one of the six official languages of provincial administration in Vojvodina, while in Croatia it is officially used in two settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pravosudje.hr/europska-povelja-o-regionalnim-ili-manjinskim-jezi | language = Croatian | publisher = [[Ministry of Justice (Croatia)]] | title = Europska povelja o regionalnim ili manjinskim jezicima | date = 2011-04-12 | accessdate = 2012-02-08 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131227001603/http://www.pravosudje.hr/europska-povelja-o-regionalnim-ili-manjinskim-jezi | archivedate = 2013-12-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Ivorian Civil War|civil war]] has left many women in need for wages, so some have resorted to prostitution, as there is high unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78730.htm |title=2006 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices " Africa " Cote d'Ivoire |publisher=United States Department of State |date=2007-03-06 |accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="voa" /&gt;

In the cities, sex workers have started organisations to protect their interests. Often they cater for a particular ethnic group. Each organisation has a president and other officers, these are normally older prostitutes who are regarded as "wiser".&lt;ref name="ency" /&gt;

==Local nomenclature==
* "Serpents" - In Abidjan, [[street prostitution|street walkers]] are known as "serpents" because of the hissing sounds they make to attract clients.&lt;ref name="voa" /&gt; ''Rue Pierre et Marie Curie'' in the city's [[red-light district]] of [[Marcory Zone 4]] is known locally as "Serpent Street".&lt;ref name="jeune"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duhem|first1=Vincent|title=Avis aux noctambules abidjanais : la Zone 4 est désormais à deux pas… de danse – JeuneAfrique.com|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/mag/245682/societe/avis-aux-noctambules-abidjanais-la-zone-4-est-desormais-a-deux-pas-de-danse/|website=Jeune Afrique|accessdate=8 January 2018|language=fr-FR|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* "Dioula women" - Younger prostitutes originating from Mali. After a short stint working as prostitutes they usually become traders in local markets.&lt;ref name="ency" /&gt;
* "Karoua women" - Older [[Zarma people|Zarma]] or [[Hausa people|Hausa]] women, usually divorced, from Ghana.&lt;ref name="ency" /&gt;
* "Evolue" - These women, from various countries in [[French West Africa]], seek clients in bars and nightclubs.&lt;ref name="ency" /&gt;
* "TouTou" - Coming from the [[British West Africa]]n states, these women are mainly street prostitutes. The name is derived from 'two shillings, two pence'; a prostitute who doesn't charge much.&lt;ref name="ency" /&gt;

==History==
Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, a form of institutional prostitution took place in the country. The political elite acquired women, usually slaves, to service the sexual needs of the unmarried males. They were initiated by religious rites and their earnings were controlled by the state. To distinguish them, they wore a cloth of white linen around their head. Married men were forbidden to use their services, and punishment was severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harley|first1=Sharon|title=Women's labor in the global economy : speaking in multiple voices|date=2007|publisher=Rutgers Univ. Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=978-0813540443|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, many [[France|French]] prostitutes came to the country, mainly from [[Paris]] and [[Marseilles]]. They worked as barmaids at bars and nightclubs, predominately in Abidjan. They charged high fees, but the bar owner took a per-client "air conditioning" commission. Because of the high fees, clients were Europeans or elite Africans.&lt;ref name="ency" /&gt;

Ghanaian woman started to migrate to the Ivory Coast to work as prostitutes in the 1970s due to a downturn in the Ghanaian economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kessler|first1=Justine L.|title=The Voices of Sex Workers (prostitutes?) and the Dilemma of Feminist Discourse|url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&amp;context=etd|publisher=University of South Florida|accessdate=8 January 2018|date=28 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This migration continued, and in the 1990s over half of the prostitutes in Abidjan were from Ghana.&lt;ref name="laval"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kouame|first1=K|title=[Migration and prostitution in the Abidjan region]|url=https://www.popline.org/node/295915|publisher=Laval University,|accessdate=8 January 2018|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Ivory Coast}}
Ivory Coast is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Trafficking within the country is more prevalent than transnational trafficking, and the majority of identified victims are children. Due to a stronger emphasis on monitoring and combating child trafficking within the country, the prevalence of adult trafficking may be under reported. Ivoirian women and girls are primarily subjected to forced labor in domestic service and restaurants in Côte d'Ivoire but are also exploited in sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="state16" /&gt; Some women and girls recruited from Ghana and Nigeria&lt;ref name="seattle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Motshegwa|first1=Lesego|title=Nigeria teens sold for prostitution in Ivory Coast|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nigeria-teens-sold-for-prostitution-in-ivory-coast/|website=The Seattle Times|accessdate=8 January 2018|date=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as waitresses are subjected to sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="state16" /&gt; Officials note illegal Ivoirian migrants in [[Algeria]] are vulnerable to trafficking due to their irregular and illegal status. A lack of comprehensive data on trafficking in Côte d'Ivoire renders the full scope of the problem unknown.&lt;ref name="state16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cote d'Ivoire 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2016/258750.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=8 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Ivory Coast as a [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]] country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cote d'Ivoire 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282638.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Quilombola''' are an ethnic minority in Brazil. They live in closed communities, called [[quilombo]]s. They trace back from slaves (mostly Angolan), brought to Brazil in the seventeenth century.
One of their leaders was [[Chico Rei]], a Congolose king captured and sold as a slave to a [[gold mine]] in [[Minas Gerais]]. He was the first to create a free [[quilombo]].

The word Quilombo comes from the [[Angola]]n word kilombo, which means "different."

The quilombo was based on the [[African way of life]], an African-European language was adopted and the religion they followed was a mixture of [[Christianity]] with African [[influences]].

As they had to fight for their existence ever since their establishment (against slave traders, the Dutch, the Portuguese, and Brazilian government), they keep closed, and their establishments are not freely accessible (because of Brazilian administration too).

Quilombo's exist (but are not limited to) in [[Manqueira]], [[Ilha de Mare]].

'''Saṛbanī''' ({{lang-ps|سړبني}}) are the largest&lt;ref&gt;http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Pashtun_Confederacies_lg.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; tribal group of [[Pashtuns]]. They are situated in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. The Sarbani include many Pashtun tribes, among whom the most numerous are the [[Tareen]], [[Durrani]] historically [[Sadduzai]], Abdali, [[Barakzai]], [[Alakozai]], [[Achakzai]], [[Gigyani tribe|Gigyani]], [[Popalzai]], [[Yusufzai]], [[Momand]], [[Shilmani]], [[Khalil (Pashtun tribe)|Khalil]], [[Ghoryakhel]], [[Shinwari (Pashtun tribe)|Shinwari]], [[Kasi (Pashtun tribe)|Kasi]], and [[Muhammadzai (Hashtnagar)]].&lt;ref&gt;The races of Afghanistan : being a brief account of the principal nations inhabiting that country (1880), https://archive.org/details/racesofafghanist015766mbp&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Pashtun legend of origins, the members of the Sarbani group all descend from Sarban, said to be the first son of the legendary founding father of the Pashtun people, [[Qais Abdur Rashid]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Sarbani'' is similar or identical to the name of an historical tribe on [[Caucasus]] that was also named Sarbani (the Caucasian tribe was recorded under this name in the 10th century). Pashtuns are believed to be of [[Scythian]] descent&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y20MTE0C9kwC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=pashtuns+scythian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_gMdT8b8JIu8-Qas87jKCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pashtun%3B%20the%20scythians%22&amp;f=false A brief history of Afghanistan, Shaista Wahab, Barry Youngerman, Infobase Publishing, 2007, page 14.]&lt;/ref&gt; and their language is classified as East Scythian (Sarmatian language is also grouped within Scythian branch).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FrwNcwKaUKoC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=pashtuns+scythian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dgUdT5OlI8Gh-QauvbWhCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20language%20is%20classified%20as%20East%20Scythian%22&amp;f=false The history and geography of human genes, Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Paolo Menozzi, Alberto Piazza, Princeton University Press, 1994, page 242.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origin of the Sarbani, might be connected with [[Hephthalites]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/diss/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDISS_derivate_000000007165/01_Text.pdf?hosts= The Hephthalites: Archaeological and Historical Analysis, Aydogdu Kurbanov, Berlin, 2010, page 242.]&lt;/ref&gt; who had a large nomadic confederation that included present-day [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] in the 5th-6th centuries AD, as well as with [[Scythians]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y20MTE0C9kwC&amp;pg=PA14 A brief history of Afghanistan, Shaista Wahab, Barry Youngerman, Infobase Publishing, 2007, page 14.]&lt;/ref&gt; who are known to have settled where most of [[Pashtuns]] live today.

The [[Durrani Empire]] that existed in the 18th-19th centuries and that was centered in the territory of present-day [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]  was founded by the [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], a [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] military commander under [[Nader Shah|Nader Shah of Persia]] and chief of the [[Durrani|Abdali]] Sarban tribe. Since that time, the Abdali tribe is known as [[Durrani]].

==Geographic distribution==

===Afghanistan===
In [[Afghanistan]], Sarbani mainly inhabit the provinces of [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]], [[Zabul]], [[Uruzgan]], [[Helmand]], [[Nimroz]], [[Farah Province|Farah]], [[Herat Province|Herat]], [[Badghis]], [[Balkh Province|Balkh]], and [[Kunduz Province|Kunduz]], as well as the provinces [[Nangarhar Province|Nangarhar]] and [[Kunar Province|Kunar]] in the eastern part of the country.

===Pakistan===
In [[Pakistan]], Sarbani are living throughout the city of [[Peshawar]], northern and eastern parts of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] regions.  Additional large settlements are found in [[Multan]], [[Quetta]],  [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|KPK]], [[Mansehra]], [[Abbottabad]], [[Haripur, Pakistan|Haripur]] and in the northern parts of [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Pashtun_Confederacies_lg.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sarbani tribes==
Abubakar Siddique writes that "Under the prevailing classifications, Pashtuns are divided into four main tribal groupings: the Sarbani, Bhittani, Ghurghust and Karlani... The Sarbanis are divided into two branches: the Sharkbun and the Kharshbun. The most significant tribes of this branch today are the [[Shirani (Pashtun tribe)|Sherani]], the Tareen, the Urmer (an adopted tribe), Durranis, Khalils, Mohmands, Daudzai, Chamkanis, Yousafzai, Shinwari and Tarkalani."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siddique|first1=Abubakar|title=The Pashtun Question: The Unresolved Key to the Future of Pakistan and Afghanistan|date=2014|publisher=C Hurst &amp; Co|isbn=978-1849042925|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkVeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=sarbani++tribes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihxbPg2Y7PAhWDXRoKHfo6A78Q6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=sarbani%20%20tribes&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Protests against Arctic drilling''' began in [[Seattle]] in 2015 in response to the news that the [[Port of Seattle]] [[Port authority|authority]] made an agreement with [[Royal Dutch Shell]] to berth [[offshore drilling|offshore]] [[drillship]]s and [[semi-submersible]]s at the Port's Terminal 5 (T5) during the off-season of [[oil exploration]] in [[Alaska]]n waters of the [[Arctic]].&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2015/&gt; Hundreds of protesters took to [[Elliott Bay]] in [[kayak]]s, rafts, and other small boats, both as a demonstration and to interrupt docking of Shell's ''Polar Pioneer'' semi-submersible drilling vessel at Terminal 5.&lt;ref name=Ryan2015/&gt; The waterborne demonstrators were dubbed '''kayaktivists''' by [[Social media|social]] and [[news media]].&lt;ref name=Usborne2015/&gt;

On September 27, 2015 Shell announced that their exploration in the summer of 2015 was "disappointing" and that they would abandon further oil exploration in the Arctic "for the foreseeable future".&lt;ref name=Joling2015/&gt;

Seattle has been a staging point for those seeking to exploit the natural resources of the Alaska region since the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] of 1896, when the city was the main supply center and departure point for prospectors heading to the gold fields of Alaska and the [[Yukon]]. The perception by some Alaskans that Seattle exerted undue influence on the [[Territory of Alaska|Territory]] helped motivate their desire for [[Alaskan statehood]], achieved in 1958. Since the discovery of oil in [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska|Prudhoe Bay]] in 1968, Seattle has played an integral role in the Alaska [[petroleum industry]].&lt;ref name=Bernton2015/&gt;

The city of Seattle says the maritime sector which includes ship builders, cargo vessels and tug companies comprises 22,000 jobs for a $2.1 billion annual contribution to the Seattle economy.&lt;ref name=Le2015/&gt;

Seattle is known for [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref name=Le2015/&gt; A theme of the [[1999 Seattle WTO protests]] was the reconciliation of the [[Labor movement|labor]] and environmental movements under the slogan "Teamsters and Turtles: Together at Last", seeking to end the traditional stalemate of job creation pitted against environmental protection in a [[zero sum]] conflict.&lt;ref name=Gottlieb2001/&gt;

In the summer 2012, Shell refurbished the ''[[Kulluk]]'' and the ''Noble Discoverer'' [[drillship]]s in Seattle, which the company said employed 400 shipyard workers and put $200 million into the local economy.&lt;ref name=Bernton2012/&gt; The ships were for use in exploration for oil in the [[Beaufort Sea|Beaufort]] and [[Chukchi Sea]]s off Alaska's North Coast, which if successful could begin production no sooner than 2023.&lt;ref name=Bernton2012/&gt; [[Greenpeace]] opposed these plans, and some [[Inupiat|Iñupiat]] people of the North Slope said that in spite of the economic benefits to them, they feared damage to the ocean environment they depend on for food.&lt;ref name=Bernton2012/&gt; A [[Barrow, Alaska]] village organization director said, "We are opposed to offshore development because the ocean is like our garden up here in the Arctic for our subsistence way of life."&lt;ref name=Bernton2012/&gt;

The ''Kulluk'' ran aground in January 2013 and had to be rescued, resulting in the [[United States Department of the Interior|US Department of the Interior]] ordering Shell to halt drilling until safety problems were corrected.&lt;ref name=Davenport2015/&gt; Shell was criticized in an Interior Department report, which cited inadequate supervision of subcontractors by Shell's management, and a lack of preparedness for the Arctic conditions.&lt;ref name=Davenport2015/&gt; New regulations were written by the Department, and drilling was restricted to shallower waters, up to {{Convert|140|ft|abbr=on}} deep, and to summer months only, and stricter rules on [[blowout preventer]]s were put in place.&lt;ref name=Davenport2015/&gt;

Environmentalists and oil industry experts agree the area is one of the most dangerous areas in the world to drill, because besides rough seas including {{Convert|50|ft|abbr=on}} waves, storms, and cold weather, the cleanup and rescue is made harder by a lack of any roads to major cities and no [[deepwater port]]s within hundreds of miles, with the closest Coast Guard station capable of assisting in an oil spill located {{Convert|1000|mi}} away.&lt;ref name=Davenport2015/&gt; [[Bowhead whale]]s and [[walrus]]es migrate through the area, and the Iñupiat fear an oil spill could damage both their [[whaling]]-based culture and livelihood.&lt;ref name=Usborne2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davenport2015/&gt; A statement from the Interior Department said they were taking a "thoughtful approach" in balancing environmental and safety concerns, and respect for the traditions of indigenous people.&lt;ref name=Davenport2015/&gt; Susan Murray of the environmental group [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]] said, "Shell has not shown that it is prepared to operate responsibly in the Arctic Ocean, and neither the company nor our government has been willing to fully and fairly evaluate the risks of Shell's proposal."&lt;ref name=Davenport2015/&gt;

Shell's Alaska vice president Pete Slaiby said its goal was not, "any kind of grand energy independence", but rather that, "This is all about energy choice," so that the US could replace oil imports from hostile foreign regimes with domestic production.&lt;ref name=Bernton2012/&gt; Shell says the Arctic holds about 30% of the undiscovered oil and gas in the world, and exploiting it is necessary to satisfy growing world demand, though US domestic petroleum production is booming in 2015, due mainly to [[Hydraulic fracturing|fracking]] in [[Texas]] and [[North Dakota]], and oil prices are falling.&lt;ref name=Usborne2015/&gt; At current rates the goal of [[United States energy independence|US energy independence]], oil exports exceeding imports, could be reached by 2030, according to the US [[Energy Information Administration]].&lt;ref name=Usborne2015/&gt; This turning point could come sooner with greatly increased Arctic oil production.&lt;ref name=Usborne2015/&gt;

In October 2013, Terminal 5's tenant, Eagle Maritime Services, made plans to relocate. The Port of Seattle decided to update T5, and they asked businesses, including [[Foss Maritime]], to find temporary uses for that terminal.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt; Foss has been in Seattle for over 100 years.&lt;ref name=Le2015/&gt; In May, 2014, Foss Maritime representatives met with Port staff, discussing the use of T5 to handle modules of a [[liquid natural gas]] plant which would go by barge to Canada for assembly.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt; In June, Foss had the idea of using T5 for mooring Shell oil rigs.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt;

The purpose of the new lease was to provide an off-season harbor for Shell vessels conducting exploratory drilling in the summer in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska's northwest coast.&lt;ref name=Le2015/&gt; The US Geological Survey has estimated the offshore reserves in the Arctic at 26 million barrels of oil and 130 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.&lt;ref name=Le2015/&gt;

The leases of Eagle Marine Services and Westwood Shipping Lines ended in July 2014, so the following month Eagle moved to the Port of Seattle's Terminal 18 and Westwood moved to [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], so T5 was without a tenant.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt; The new lease with Shell was valued at $13 million.&lt;ref name=Le2015/&gt; During these months, representatives of Shell, Foss, The [[US Coast Guard]], the Port, and Puget Sound Pilots watched a simulation of an oil rig entering Elliott Bay to evaluate traffic safety and determine where to moor the rigs.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt; In December 2014, the commissioners and staff of the Port were receiving emails from the maritime community expressing support for hosting the drilling rigs.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt; During the last months of 2014, a safety assessment was carried out by the Port, the Coast Guard, Foss, and Puget Sound Pilots, by conducting a simulation of an oil rig entering Elliott Bay.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt;

==Public announcement and protest==

On January 13, 2015, the first public meeting took place regarding plans by Foss to host Shell's Arctic drilling fleet at Terminal 5.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt; On February 9, the lease with Shell was signed by Port of Seattle CEO Ted Fick.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt;

When the deal became known, Seattle Mayor [[Ed Murray (Washington politician)|Ed Murray]] and the [[Seattle City Council]] announced they would review it.&lt;ref name=Hayes2015/&gt; On March 9, the city of Seattle began looking for ways it could hinder the deal.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt; Murray asked Port to reconsider the contract with Foss, and said that the Port of Seattle must get permits for new uses in order to host the Arctic drilling fleet, explaining that, "This is an opportunity for the port and all of us to make a bold statement about how oil companies contribute to climate change, oil spills and other environmental disasters – and reject this short-term lease."&lt;ref name=Le2015/&gt;

Shell's ''Polar Pioneer'' semi-submersible drilling rig arrived in [[Port Angeles, Washington]] on April 17, 2015, on its way to Seattle.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt; The ''Polar Pioneer'', {{IMO Number|8754140}}, was built in 1985 by [[Hitachi Zosen Corporation]] in [[Ariake, Kagoshima]], Japan.&lt;ref name=DNVGL/&gt;  The rig is {{Convert|122|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} long and {{Convert|89|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} wide, with a draft of {{Convert|9.2|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and rising to a height of {{convert|307|ft|abbr=on|}}, weighing {{GT|38,564|disp=adj}}.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=DNVGL/&gt; It is driven by [[electric motor]]s powered by [[diesel generator]]s, at an average speed of {{Convert|6.3|knots}} , and a maximum of {{Convert|8.2|knots}}.&lt;ref name=DNVGL/&gt;&lt;ref name=MarineTraffic/&gt; The [[Marshall Islands]]-[[Ship registration|registered]] ship is owned and operated by [[Transocean]], and is ander contract to Royal Dutch Shell.&lt;ref name=DNVGL/&gt;

On May 11, the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] and the Department of the Interior announced that Shell had won conditional approval to being exploratory drilling in the Chukchi Sea with leases Shell had acquired in 2008.&lt;ref name=Davenport2015/&gt; Seven more state and Federal permits would be required to commence operations.&lt;ref name=Usborne2015/&gt; The decision was a victory for Shell, having worked for several years to overcome regulatory roadblocks, based primarily on concerns of an accident like the 2010 [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Davenport2015/&gt; The dangers of the Arctic seas and weather were seen as increasing the risk of an accident, as well as exacerbating the difficulty of containing a blowout and oil spill, and carrying out cleanup.&lt;ref name=Davenport2015/&gt; An earlier attempt to begin drilling was suspended due to safety issues including a fire on one rig.&lt;ref name=Usborne2015/&gt;

On May 12, the same day Port Commissioners filed an appeal of the city's land use permit decision, Shell's drillship ''Noble Discoverer'' arrived in [[Everett, Washington]] on its way to [[Bellingham, Washington]].&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=EverettHerald2015/&gt; The ship, {{IMO|6608608}} is a Liberian-flagged [[Sonat]] Discoverer-class drillship built in 1966 by Namura Shipbuilding and owned by [[Noble Corporation]], weighing {{GT|16000|disp=adj}}, {{Convert|514|ft|abbr=on}} long with a {{convert|175|ft|abbr=on}} tall drilling derrick capable of drilling in {{convert|1000|ft|abbr=on}} of water to a drilling depth of {{Convert|20000|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=NobleCorp/&gt;&lt;ref name=DNVGL2/&gt; It was met by 10 protesters in kayaks, along with a Greenpeace motorboat carrying reporters.&lt;ref name=EverettHerald2015/&gt; The kayakers displayed banners reading "ShellNo.org" and "Arctic drilling = climate chaos".&lt;ref name=EverettHerald2015/&gt; The Everett protest was described by one kayaktivist as "just a warm up" for the upcoming event in Seattle.&lt;ref name=EverettHerald2015/&gt;

In the pre-dawn hours of May 14, the ''Polar Pioneer'' left Port Angeles with a Coast Guard and tugboat escort.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt; A {{Convert|500|ft|adj=on}} safety zone was established around the moving rig, and the Coast Guard issued warnings to protestors ahead of time to stay clear.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt; At least 20 kayaks, and members of the [[Duwamish Tribe]] in a large wooden canoe, greeted the rig in Elliott Bay, unfurling a banner reading "Arctic Drilling = Climate Change."&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt; Many of the kayakers were freshly trained that day, in rented boats.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt;  When the ''Polar Pioneer'' arrived in Elliott Bay, it was met by a flotilla of hundreds more protestors in kayaks and other small boats, voicing their opposition to oil drilling in Arctic waters because of the risk of oil spills, undersea [[Blowout (well drilling)|oil well blowouts]], damage to wildlife from human activity, and the [[climate change]] caused by the use of fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=Usborne2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davenport2015/&gt; There were no problems or arrests during the protest and the ''Polar Pioneer'' was safely moored at Terminal 5 at 4:30 pm.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt;

A counter-protestor at Seacrest Park, recently laid off from the maritime industry, said "If these (activists) choose to put me and guys like me out of work for an idea, what are they trying to do?"&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt; Foss Maritime said to date, 417 people had been employed by the Shell contract, with Shell paying Transocean $593,000 per day to lease the ''Polar Pioneer'', out of some $6 billion the company was going to spend on Alaska oil exploration.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt; Over the life of the two-year lease, Foss will pay $13.17 million to the Port of Seattle.&lt;ref name=Beekman2015/&gt;

[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Alaska [[State legislature (United States)|State Representative]] [[Bob Herron]] said on the Alaska State House floor, "It must be nice to eat cheese and sip wine in Olympia while they talk about the Arctic. But it does remind us of the paternalistic past when the state of Alaska was plundered by people from Washington and other areas … who covet our resources."&lt;ref name=Bernton2015/&gt;

Shell said they were committed to drilling in the Arctic one way or another, but City Council member [[Mike O'Brien (Seattle politician)|Mike O'Brien]] told [[MSNBC]]'s [[Chris Hayes (journalist)|Chris Hayes]], "All the other major players have pulled out of the Arctic. It's only Shell that's left. And the only two ports they were looking at to host this fleet were Seattle and [[Dutch Harbor]], Alaska. And Dutch Harbor's really a problematic environment because the weather up there is so severe. So we think that if they're not in Seattle then it may be the end of Arctic drilling for the near future."&lt;ref name=Hayes2015/&gt; With regard to the economic impact on Seattle and the threat of lost jobs, O'Brien said, "There's no doubt that our economy is tied to the fossil fuel industry. We have a lot of work to do if we're going to unwind that and become that kind of sustainable planet that we want to be. [...] there's jobs tied to that fossil fuel industry. We have to figure out how we transition away from that. What we can't do today is take a huge step backwards. And drilling in the Arctic and tying Seattle's future to successful drilling in the Arctic is that huge step backwards that undermines what were trying to do."&lt;ref name=Hayes2015/&gt;

As part of the ongoing series of protests, activists from the group Mosquito Fleet{{ref|a|*}} rented a {{Convert|4000|sqft|abbr=on}} barge from Lakeshore Marine Construction of [[Kenmore, Washington|Kenmore]].&lt;ref name= Lacitis2015/&gt; They anchored it off Seacrest Park, christening it "The People's Platform", and equipping it with speakers, video equipment, a huge video screen, and [[Solar power|solar]] and [[wind power]] supplies.&lt;ref name= Lacitis2015/&gt; The project was led by Arctic drilling protest organizer John Sellers, who works for a nonprofit called [[The Other 98%]] which addresses "undue corporate influence". The Mosquito Fleet raised $16,400 in donations in 6 days with a YouTube video proposal on [[Indiegogo]] to fund the barge rental, at a rate of about $15,000 every two weeks.&lt;ref name= Lacitis2015/&gt;

On May 22, 2015 the protests spread to Bellingham when student activist Chiara D'Angelo chained herself to the [[anchor]] chain of the Royal Dutch Shell barge ''[[Arctic Challenger]]'' for 63 hours.&lt;ref name=CSM2015/&gt;

The '''Senufo people''', also known as '''Siena''', '''Senefo''', '''Sene''', '''Senoufo''', '''Syénambélé''' and '''Bamana''', are a [[West Africa|West African]] ethnolinguistic group.

==Demographics and languages==
[[File:Senufo languages.png|thumb|left|200px|Approximate distribution of Senufo people in Ivory Coast, Mali, Burkina Faso and Ghana]]
In the 1980s, estimates placed the total ethnic group population of Senufo people somewhere between 1.5 and 2.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;Garber (1987) estimates the total number of Senufos at some 1.5 million; the [[Ethnologue]] (15th edition), based on various population estimates, counts 2.7 million.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 estimate places the total over 3 million, with majority of them living in Ivory Coast in places such as [[Katiola]], and some 0.8 million in southeastern Mali.&lt;ref name="Daddieh2016p427"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Imperato2008p266"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Group2013p184"&gt;{{cite book|author=Diagram Group|title=Encyclopedia of African Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISAuAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-96334-7|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their highest population densities are found in the land between the [[Black Volta]] river, [[Bagoe River]] and [[Bani River]].&lt;ref name="Olson1996p515"/&gt;

The Senufo people are typically studied in three large subgroups which have been relatively isolated.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p253"&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Shoup III|title=Ethnic Groups of Africa and the Middle East: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GN5yv3-U6goC&amp;pg=PA253|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-363-7|pages=253–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern Senufo are called "Supide or Kenedougou", found near [[Odienne]], and who helped found an important kingdom of West Africa and challenged Muslim missionaries and traders. The southern Senufo are the largest group, numbering over 2 million, who allowed Muslim traders to settle within their communities in the 18th century who actively proselytized, and about 20% of the southern Senufo are Muslims. The third group is very small and isolated from both northern and southern Senufo.&lt;ref name="Olson1996p515"/&gt; Some sociologists such as the French scholar Holas mentions fifteen identifiable sub-groups of Senufo people, with thirty dialects and four [[caste]]s scattered between them.&lt;ref name=richter37/&gt;

The term ''Senufo'' refers to a linguistic group comprising roughly thirty related dialects within the larger [[Senufo languages|Gur]] language family.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It belongs to the Gur-branch of the Niger-Congo language family, and consists of four distinct languages namely [[Palaka language|Palaka]](also spelt [[Kpalaga language|Kpalaga]]), [[Djimini language|Djimini]](also spelt [[Dyimini]]), and [[Senari languages|Senari]] in Côte d'Ivoire and [[Supyire language|Suppire]]( also spelt Supyire) in Mali, as well as [[Karaboro languages|Karaboro]] in [[Burkina Faso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Senufo|title=Senufo people|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britsenufo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Language characteristics: [https://www.ethnologue.com/language/sef/19 Sénoufo, Cebaara] in Ivory Coast, [https://www.ethnologue.com/language/myk Sénoufo, Mamara] in Mali, [https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/senufo-1 15 sub-languages within Senufo]&lt;/ref&gt; Within each group, numerous subdivisions use their own names for the people and language; the name Senufo is of external origin. Palaka separated from the main Senufo stock well before the 14th century ad; at about that time, with the founding of the town of Kong as a Bambara trade-route station, the rest of the population began migrations to the south, west, and north, resulting in the present divisions.The Senufo speaking people range from 800,000 to one million and live in agricultural based communities predominately located in the [[Côte-d'Ivoire|Côte d'Ivoire]], [[West Africa]], [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web

[[Korhogo]], an ancient town in northern Ivory Coast dating from the 13th century, is linked to the Senufo people. This separation of languages and sub-ethnic groups may be linked to the 14th-century migrations with its founding along with the Bambara trade-route.&lt;ref name=britsenufo&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Senufo Senufo people], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Vrouw bezig met het wannen van rijst TMnr 20012698.jpg|thumb|180px|Senufo people traditionally have lived in circular shaped mud huts, agriculture historically their main livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patricia Sheehan|author2=Jacqueline Ong|title=Côte D'Ivoire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2GfaBqNFRBUC&amp;pg=PA65|year=2010|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-4854-9|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Senufo people emerged as a group sometime within the 15th or 16th century.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p253"/&gt; They were a significant part of the 17th to 19th-century [[Kénédougou Kingdom]] (literally "country of the plain") with the capital of [[Sikasso]]. This region saw many wars including the rule of [[Daoula Ba Traoré]], a cruel despot who reigned between 1840 and 1877.&lt;ref name="Daddieh2016p427"/&gt;&lt;ref name=imperatolxx/&gt; The Islamisation of the Senufo people began during this historical period of the Kénédougou Kingdom, but it was the chiefs who converted, while the general Senufo population refused.&lt;ref name="Daddieh2016p427"/&gt; Daoula Ba Traoré attempted to convert his kingdom to Islam, destroying many villages within the kingdom such as Guiembe and Nielle in 1875 because they resisted his views.&lt;ref name="Daddieh2016p427"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cyril K. Daddieh|title=Historical Dictionary of Cote d'Ivoire (The Ivory Coast)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_VptCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA427|year=2016|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8108-7389-6|pages=426–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kénédougou dynastic rulers attacked their neighbors as well, such as the [[Zarma people]] and they in turn counterattacked many times between 1883 and 1898.&lt;ref name="Daddieh2016p427"/&gt;

The pre-colonial wars and violence led to their migration into Burkina Faso in regions that became towns such as Tiembara in [[Kiembara Department]].&lt;ref name="Daddieh2016p427"/&gt; The Kénédougou kingdom and the Traoré dynasty were dissolved in 1898 with the arrival of French colonial rule.&lt;ref name=imperatolxx&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pascal James Imperato|author2=Gavin H.

===Slavery===
The Senufo people were both victims of and perpetrators of slavery as they victimized other ethnic groups by enslavement.&lt;ref name="Lovejoy2011p170"/&gt; They were enslaved by various African ethnic groups as the [[Denkyira]] and [[Akan people|Akan]] states were attacked or fell in the 17th and 18th centuries. They themselves bought and sold slaves to Muslim merchants, [[Ashanti people|Asante people]] and [[Baoulé people]]. As refugees from other West African ethnic groups escaped wars, states Paul Lovejoy, some of them moved into the Senufo lands, seized their lands and enslaved them.&lt;ref name="Lovejoy2011p170"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul E. Lovejoy|title=Transformations in Slavery: A History of Slavery in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXVFnHqhLvcC&amp;pg=PA170 |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-50277-1|pages=170–171, 57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin A.

The largest demand for slaves initially came from the markets of [[Sudan]], and for a long time, slave trading was the most important economic activity across the Sahel and West Africa, states Martin Klein. Sikasso and Bobo-Dioulasso were important sources of slaves captured who were then moved to [[Timbuktu]] and [[Banamba]] on their way to the Sudanese and [[Mauritania]]n slave markets.&lt;ref name="Klein1998p53"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin A.

Those enslaved in Senufo lands worked the land, herds and served within the home. Their owner and his dependents also had the right to have sexual intercourse with female domestic slaves. The children of a female slave inherited her slave status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch|editor=Gwyn Campbell, Suzanne Miers and Joseph Calder Miller|title=Women and Slavery: Africa, the Indian Ocean world, and the medieval north Atlantic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jgm69dJt4DcC&amp;pg=PA50 |year=2007|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-8214-1723-2|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senufo are predominantly an agricultural people cultivating corn, millet, yams and peanut. Senufo villages consist of small mud-brick homes. In the rainy southern communities of Senufo, thatched roofs are common, while flat roofs are prevalent in dry desert-like north. The Senufo is a patriarchal extended family society, where arranged typically cousin marriage and polygyny has been fairly common. However, succession and property inheritance has been matrilineal.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p253"/&gt;&lt;ref name=britsenufo/&gt;

As agriculturalists, they cultivate a wide variety of crops, including cotton and cash crops for the international market. As musicians, they are world renowned, playing a multitude of instruments from: wind instruments                ([[Wind instrument|Aerophones]]),  stringed instruments ([[Chordophone|Chordaphone]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) and percussive instruments                   ([[Membranophone|Membranophones).]]   Senufo communities utilize a [[caste]] system, each division known as a ''[[katioula]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this system the farmers known as Fo no,  and the artisans at the opposite ends of the spectrum. The term artisan itself encompasses different individual castes within Senufo society including blacksmiths (Kule), carvers (Kpeene), brasscutters (Tyeli), potterers, and leather workers,  whose lives revolve around the roles, responsibilities and structures inhabited by the individual class.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Training to become an artisan takes about seven or eight years; commencing with an apprenticeship where the trainees create objects unassociated with the religion of the Senufo, then culminating with an initiation process where they obtain the ability to create ritual object.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://creativity.denverartmuseum.org/?lesson-plan=drums-of-africa| title = Creativity Resource for Teachers  » Blog Archive   » Drums of Africa| website = creativity.denverartmuseum.org| access-date = 2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senufo are regionally famous as musicians and superb carvers of wood sculpture, masks and figurines.&lt;ref name=britsenufo/&gt; The Senufo people have specialized their art and handicraft work by subgroups, wherein the art is learnt within this group from one generation to the next. The ''Kulubele'' specialize as woodcarvers, the ''Fonombele'' specialize in blacksmith and basketry work, the ''Kpeembele'' as brass casting specialists, the ''Djelebele'' are renowned for leatherwork, the ''Tchedumbele'' are masters of gunsmith work, while ''Numu'' specialize in smithing and weaving.&lt;ref name=richter37/&gt; Outside the artisan subgroups, the Senufo people have hunters, musicians, grave-diggers, diviners and healers who are called the ''Fejembele''.&lt;ref name=richter37/&gt; Among these various subgroups, the leatherworkers or ''Djelebele'' are the ones who have most adopted Islam, and even those who convert retain many of their animist practices.&lt;ref name=richter37/&gt;

The Senufo people have traditionally been a socially stratified society, like many West African ethnic groups with [[caste]]s.&lt;ref name="Sardan1984p56"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean-Pierre Olivier de Sardan|title=Les sociétés Songhay-Zarma (Niger-Mali): chefs, guerriers, esclaves, paysans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwfsBQBCcvMC&amp;pg=PA56|year=1984|publisher=Paris: Karthala|isbn=978-2-86537-106-8|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tal Tamari| year= 1991|title= The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa| journal= The Journal of African History| volume= 32| number= 2| pages= 221–250|publisher= Cambridge University Press| jstor= 182616| doi=10.1017/s0021853700025718}}, '''Quote:''' "[Castes] are found among the Soninke, the various Manding-speaking populations, the Wolof, Tukulor, '''Senufo''', Minianka, Dogon, Songhay, and most Fulani, Moorish and Tuareg populations".&lt;/ref&gt; These endogamous divisions are locally called ''Katioula'', and one of the strata in this division includes slaves and descendants of slaves.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p253"/&gt; According to Dolores Richter, the caste system found among Senufo people features "hierarchical ranking including despised lower castes, occupational specificity, ritual complementarity, endogamy, hereditary membership, residential isolation and the political superiority of farmers over artisan castes".&lt;ref name=richter37/&gt;

The Senufo people usually fall within four societies in their culture: Poro, Sandogo, Wambele, and Tyekpa. While all the societies fill particular roles in the governance and education of the Senufo people, the [[Poro]] and [[Sandogo]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Spirituality and divination are divided between these two gender imperative societies with men falling under the Poro society and women falling under the Sando or Sandogo society, with the exception of men who are members because of their mother.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These societies are also the two which create the majority of commissioned Seunfo art.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glaze|first=Anita|date=1993|title=Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies|jstor=4108736|journal=Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senufo villages are typically independent of each other, and each has a male secret society called ''Poro'' with elaborate initiation rituals in a patch of forest they consider as sacred.&lt;ref name="Daddieh2016p427"/&gt;&lt;ref name=richter37/&gt; The initiation rituals involve masks, figurines and ritual equipment that the Senufo people carve and have perfected. The secrecy has helped the Senufo people to preserve their culture in the times of wars and political pressure. They wear specially crafted [[brass]] [[jewelry]], such as those mimicking wildlife.&lt;ref name=shakarov41/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;''"The main function of Poro is to guarantee a good relationship between the living world and the ancestors. Nerejao is an ancestress who is recognized as the true head of the Poro society. Divination, which is governed by the Sandogo society, is also an important part of Senufo religion. Although Sandogo is usually considered a women's society, men who are called to the profession and inherit through the matrilineal line are permitted to become diviners."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Sandogo'' are women diviners among the Senufo people. They too have their own rituals and secret order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Farris Thompson|title=African Art in Motion: Icon and Act|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6A2ppfTB5MC&amp;pg=PA82|year=1974|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03843-1|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rosalind Hackett|author2=Rowland Abiodun|title=Art and Religion in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCJ71rRnzhgC|year=1998|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0-8264-3655-9|pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Senufo people have ''Wambele'' and ''Typka'' who perform sorcery and rituals.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p253"/&gt;

Within Senufo culture, the female form is placed above all others in terms of beauty and aesthetics and caryatid figures are seen with various cultural connotations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This is tied into the worship of the spirit "Ancient Mother" or the spirit "mother", Maleeo, who is revered as a guiding entity by all Poro society initiates and members.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The goddess Maleeo is a partner of the god Kolocolo, who is seen as the identifying deity of the Sandogo, who granted the people marriage and this particular type of lineage to allow communication from humanity and the spirit world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Caryatid figures are seen as representations of the role of women as spiritual mediators and the Sandogo utilize them in ceremonies as symbols of this bilateral celestial discourse.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Likewise, in the case of the Poro, there are writings about caryatid figures being used in ceremonies where they are brought out to commemorate the advance in the age-grade cycle,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; as well as being utilized to raise funds by initiates of the society. Calved figures were used in a tyekpa funeral ceremony as dance sculpture, held upon the head of the dancers while the ceremony takes place.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The traditional Senufo religion is a type of animism. This Senufo belief includes ancestral and nature spirits, who can be contacted. They believe in a Supreme Being, who is viewed in a dual male-female: a male Creator God called ''Kolotyolo'' or ''Koulotiolo'', and an Ancient Mother called ''Maleeo'' or ''Katieleo''.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p253"/&gt;

===Influence===
The art of Senufo people inspired 20th-century European artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Fernand Léger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Read|title=Picasso and Apollinaire: The Persistence of Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cuUlDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24361-3|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Keith Sawyer|title=Explaining Creativity: The Science of Human Innovation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlT1AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190 |year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-516164-9|pages=190–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldwater1986p152"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert John Goldwater|title=Primitivism in Modern Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-Ldmim-CA0C&amp;pg=PA152 |year=1986|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-70490-9|pages=152–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cubism and masks found in Senufo pieces were a part of Pablo Picasso's African period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rfi.fr/africa/20151206-senufo-african-art-inspired-picasso-comes-france Senufo African art that inspired Picasso comes to France], RFI (2015); [http://www.clevelandart.org/events/exhibitions/senufo-art-history-and-style-west-africa Senufo: Art and Identity in West Africa], Cleveland Museum of Art (2015), Quote: "Some of the most beloved artistic creations of sub-Saharan Africa, masks, figures, and decorative art labeled as Senufo have been the subject of numerous studies by African, American, and European scholars since the 1930s. The interest in sculpture identified as Senufo was largely stimulated by its discovery by the artistic avant-garde in the early twentieth century. Pablo Picasso and Fernand Léger were among those to find inspiration in the oeuvre of their West African counterparts."&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Senufo'' has become a category to art collectors and scholars, a symbolism for the artistic traditions of West Africa, starting with the early twentieth century. Old pieces of Senufo art are found in many leading museums of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/smpa/hd_smpa.htm Senufo Sculpture from West Africa: An Influential Exhibition at The Museum of Primitive Art, New York, 1963], Susan Elizabeth Gagliardi (2010), Art History Department, Emory University&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sex position''' is a position of the body that an individual or couple people may use for [[sexual intercourse]] or other [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]]. Sexual acts are generally described by the positions the participants adopt in order to perform those acts. Though sexual intercourse generally involves [[Sexual penetration|penetration]] of the body of one person by another, sex positions commonly involve penetrative or [[non-penetrative sex|non-penetrative]] sexual activities.

Three categories of sexual intercourse are commonly practiced: [[vagina]]l intercourse (involving vaginal penetration), [[anal sex|anal penetration]], and [[oral sex]] (especially mouth-on-genital stimulation).&lt;ref name="health.discovery.com"&gt;{{cite web|title= Sexual Intercourse| publisher=[[Discovery Channel|Discovery.com]]| accessdate=2008-01-12|url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/intercourse.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822040701/http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/intercourse.html|archivedate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex acts may also involve other forms of genital stimulation, such as solo or mutual [[masturbation]], which may involve rubbing or penetration by [[Fingering (sexual act)|the use of fingers or hands]] or by a device ([[sex toy]]), such as a [[dildo]] or [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]]. The act may also involve [[anilingus]]. There are numerous sex positions that participants may adopt in any of these types of sexual intercourse or acts; some authors have argued that the number of sex positions is essentially limitless.

==History==
[[Sex manual]]s usually present a guide to sex positions. Sex manuals have a long history. In the Graeco-Roman era, a sex manual was written by
[[Philaenis|Philaenis of Samos]], possibly a [[hetaira]] ([[courtesan]]) of the [[Hellenistic period]] (3rd–1st century BC).&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Erôs in Ancient Greece|author1=Sanders, E.|author2=Thumiger, C.|author3=Carey, C.|author4=Lowe, N.|date=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199605507|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qt7JkvxScSkC|page=287|accessdate=2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of [[Vatsyayana]], believed to have been written in the 1st to 6th centuries, has a notorious reputation as a sex manual. Different sex positions result in differences in the depth of sexual penetration and the angle of penetration. Many attempts have been made to categorize sex positions. [[Alfred Kinsey]] categorized six primary positions,&lt;ref&gt;6 Positions For Sexual Intercourse - In Order Of Popularity - Sex, Love And Marriage - Book of Lists - Canongate Home&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known European medieval text dedicated to sexual positions is the ''[[Speculum al foderi]]'', sometimes known as "The Mirror of Coitus" (or literally{{according to whom|date=October 2017}} "a mirror for fuckers"), a 15th-century [[Catalan language|Catalan]] text discovered in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Solomon, editor (1986). ''Text and Concordance of Speculum al foderi, Biblioteca Nacional MS. 3356''. {{ISBN|0-942260-60-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Solomon (1990). ''The Mirror of coitus : a translation and edition of the fifteenth-century Speculum al foderi''. Spanish. {{ISBN|0-940639-48-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusively penetrative==
These positions involve the insertion of a phallic object(s) (such as a penis, [[strap-on dildo]], plug, or other [[Sex toy#Flesh-like materials used in sex toys|nonporous object(s)]]) into a vagina, anus or mouth.

===Penetrating partner on top with front entry===
{{See also|Missionary position}}
The most used sex position is the [[missionary position]]. In this position, the participants face each other. The receiving partner lies on their back with legs apart, while the penetrating partner lies on top. This position and the following variations may be used for [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]] or [[Anal sex|anal intercourse]].

*The penetrating partner stands in front of the receiving partner, whose legs dangle over the edge of a bed or some other platform like a table.&lt;ref name="coville"&gt;Nafzawi, Muhammad ibn Muhammad al, and Jim Colville (trans.). ''The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight''. The Kegan Paul Arabia library, vol. 7. London: Kegan Paul, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; With the receiving partner's legs lifted towards the ceiling and resting against the penetrating partner, this is sometimes called the ''butterfly position''. This can also be done as a kneeling position.
*The receiving partner lies on their back. The penetrating partner stands and lifts the receiving partner's pelvis for penetration. A variant is for the receiving partner to rest their legs on the penetrating partner's shoulders.
*The receiving partner lies on their back, legs pulled up straight and knees near to the head. The penetrating partner holds the receiving partner's legs and penetrates from above.
*Similarly to the previous position, but the receiving partner's legs need not be straight and the penetrating partner wraps their arms around the receiving partner to push the legs as close as possible to the chest. Called ''the stopperage'' in Burton's translation of ''[[The Perfumed Garden]]''.&lt;ref name="perfumed garden"&gt;''The Perfumed Garden'', Shaykh Nefwazi {{sic}}, translated by Sir Richard Francis Burton, 1886. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/garden/ full text available at Internet Sacred Text Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[coital alignment technique]]'', a position where a woman is vaginally penetrated by a man, and the penetrating partner moves upward along the woman's body until the penis is pointing down, the dorsal side of the penis now rubbing against the clitoris.
*The receiving partner crosses their feet behind their head (or at least puts their feet next to their ears), while lying on their back. The penetrating partner then holds the receiving partner tightly around each instep or ankle and lies on the receiving partner full-length. A variation is to have the receiving partner cross their ankles on their stomach, knees to shoulders, and then have the penetrating partner lie on the receiving partner's crossed ankles with their full weight. Called the ''Viennese oyster'' by ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''.&lt;ref name="joy"&gt;Comfort, Alex, ''The Joy of Sex: Fully Revised &amp; Completely Updated for the 21st Century''. Crown. Fully rev. ed., 2002. {{ISBN|1-4000-4614-9}}, 256 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penetrating from behind===
[[File:Warren Cup BM GR 1999.4-26.1 n1.jpg|thumb|1st century AD depiction of 'spooning']]
{{See also|Doggy style}}
Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal penetration. Variants of the ''[[doggy style]]'' or ''doggy position'' include:
*The receiving partner is on all fours with their torso horizontal and the penetrating partner inserts either their penis or sex toy into either the vagina or anus from behind.&lt;ref name= Rogiere&gt;Rogiere, Jean, ''The Little Book of Sex''. Ulysses Press, 2001. {{ISBN|1-56975-305-9}}, 96 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The receiving partner's torso is angled downwards and the penetrating partner raises their own hips above those of the receiving partner for maximum penetration.
*The penetrating partner places their feet on each side of the receiving partner while keeping their knees bent and effectively raising up as high as possible while maintaining penetration. The penetrating partner's hands usually have to be placed on the receiving partner's back to keep from falling forward.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*The receiving partner kneels upright while the penetrating partner gently pulls the receiving partner's arms backwards at the wrists towards them.

In the ''[[spoons sex position|spoons position]]'' both partners lie on their side, facing the same direction.&lt;ref name="sex for dummies"&gt;Westheimer, Ruth K., ''Sex for Dummies''. For Dummies. 2nd ed., 2000. {{ISBN|0-7645-5302-X}}, 432 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Variants of this technique include the following:
*The receiving partner lies on their side. The penetrating partner kneels and penetrates from behind. Alternatively, the penetrating partner can stand if the receiving partner is on a raised surface.
*The receiving partner lies facing down, possibly with their legs spread. The penetrating partner lies on top of them.&lt;ref name="little book"&gt;Rogiere, Jean, ''The Little Book of Sex''. Ulysses Press. 2001. {{ISBN|1-56975-305-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The placement of a pillow beneath the receiving partner's hips can help increase stimulation in this position.
*The receiving partner lies face down, knees together. The penetrating partner lies on top with spread legs.
*The receiving partner lies on their side with their uppermost leg forward. The penetrating partner kneels astride the receiver's lowermost leg.

[[File:Kama sutra 24 detail.jpg|thumb|Woman on top position in the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'']]

===Receiving partner on top===
{{See also|Woman on top}}
[[File:Wiki-cowgirl.png|thumb|The [[cowgirl sex position|'cowgirl' position]]]]

Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal penetration.
When the receiving partner is a woman, these positions are sometimes called the ''woman on top'', ''cowboy'' or ''cowgirl'' positions.

A feature of these positions is that the penetrating partner lies on their back with the receiving partner on top:
*The receiving partner can [[kneel]] while straddling the penetrating partner, with the participants facing each other.
*Alternatively, the receiving partner can face away from the penetrating partner. This position is sometimes called the ''reverse cowboy'' or ''reverse cowgirl'' position.
*The receiving partner can arch back with hands on the ground.
*The receiving partner can [[Squatting position|squat]] (instead of kneel) facing the penetrating partner.
*The receiving partner can bring forward their knees against the ground.
*The penetrating partner lies with their upper back on a low table, couch, chair or edge of bed, keeping their feet flat on the floor and back parallel to floor. The receiving partner straddles them, also keeping their feet on the floor. Receiving partner can assume any of various positions.
*The ''[[lateral coital position]]'' was recommended by [[Masters and Johnson]], and was preferred by three quarters of their heterosexual study participants after having tried it. The position involves the male on his back, with the female rolled slightly to the side so that her pelvis is atop his, but her weight is beside his.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher= Little Brown and Company | edition=1st | year=June 1970 | isbn=0-316-54985-1 | title=Human Sexual Inadequacy | last=Masters | first=Johnson | page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position can also be used for anal penetration, and is not limited to heterosexual partners.

[[File:Wiki-sitting-sp.png|thumb|A couple performing sexual intercourse from a seated position]]

===Sitting and kneeling===
Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal penetration.
*The penetrating partner sits on an area surface, legs outstretched. The receiving partner sits on top and wraps their legs around the penetrating partner. Called ''pounding on the spot'' in the Burton translation of ''[[The Perfumed Garden]]''.&lt;ref name="perfumed garden"/&gt; If the penetrating partner [[Lotus position|sits cross-legged]], it is called the ''lotus position'' or ''lotus flower''. The position can be combined with fondling of [[erogenous zone]]s.
*The penetrating partner sits in a chair. The receiving partner straddles penetrating partner and sits, facing the penetrating partner, feet on floor. This is sometimes called a ''[[lap dance]]'', which is somewhat erroneous as a lap dance typically does not involve penetration. The receiving partner may also sit in reverse, with their back to the penetrating partner.
*The penetrating partner sits on a couch or in a chair that has armrests. The receiving partner sits in the penetrating partner's lap, perpendicular to penetrating partner, with their back against the armrest.
*The penetrating partner kneels while the receiving partner lies on their back, ankles on each side of penetrating partner's shoulders.&lt;ref name="perfumed garden"/&gt;

[[File:Wiki-standing.png|right|thumbnail|One partner stands while holding up the other without a support]]

===Standing===
Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal penetration. In the basic standing position, both partners stand facing each other. The following variations are possible:
*In the basic standing position, both partners stand facing each other and engage in vaginal sex. In order to match heights, the shorter partner can, for instance, stand on a stair or wear high heels. It may be easier to maintain solid thrusts if the woman has her back to a wall. With such a support, the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' calls this position the ''Suspended Congress''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamasutra-sex.org/text/ |title=Kama Sutra – the ancient art of love |publisher=Kamasutra-sex.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is most often used in upright places, such as a wall in a bedroom or a [[shower]].
*The penetrating partner stands, and the receiving partner wraps their arms around his neck, and their legs around his waist, thereby exposing either the [[vagina]] or [[Human anus|anus]] to the man's [[Human penis|penis]]. This position is made easier with the use of a solid object behind the receiver, as above. To assume this position, it can be easier to start with the receiving partner laying on their back on the edge of a bed; the penetrating partner puts his elbows under their knees, enters them, and then lifts them as he rises to a standing position. In Japan, this is colloquially called the ''Ekiben'' position, after a specific bento lunch box sold at train stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jslang.com/details.php?slangn=145|title=ekiben|publisher=JSlang]|accessdate=2011-10-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425015152/http://www.jslang.com/details.php?slangn=145|archivedate=2012-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alternatively, the receiving partner can face away from the penetrating partner which allows for anal sex. This position is varied by having the receiving partner assume different semi-standing positions. For instance, they may bend at the waist, resting their hands or elbows on a table.

===Anal sex positions===
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril anal sex detail.jpg|thumb|19th century depiction of anal penetration; detail of a painting by [[Édouard-Henri Avril|Paul Avril]]]]
{{See also|Anal sex}}
These positions involve [[anal sex|anal penetration]]: 
*[[Doggy style]] penetration maximizes the depth of penetration, but can pose the risk of pushing against the [[sigmoid colon]]. If the receiving partner is male, this increases the chances of stimulating the prostate. The penetrating partner controls the [[thrust]]ing rhythm. A variation is the ''leapfrog position'', in which the receiving partner angles their torso downward. The receiving partner may also lie flat and face down, with the penetrating partner straddling their thighs. [[File:Wiki-anal missionary.png|thumb|Anal sex between two men in the missionary position]]
*In the [[missionary position|missionary]] positions, to achieve optimal alignment, the receiving partner's legs should be in the air with the knees drawn towards their chest. Some sort of support (such as a pillow) under the receiving partner's hips can also be useful. The penetrating partner positions themselves between the receiving partner's legs. The penetrating partner controls the [[thrusting]] rhythm. This position is often cited as good for beginners, because it allows them to relax more fully than is usual in the doggy style position.
*The [[spoons sex position|spoons position]] allows the receiving partner to control initial penetration and the depth, speed and force of subsequent thrusting.
*The ''[[Reverse missionary position|receiving partner on top]]'' positions allow the receiving partner more control over the depth, rhythm and speed of penetration. More specifically, the receiving partner can slowly push their anus down on the penetrating partner, allowing time for their muscles to relax.

===Less common positions===
&lt;!-- T-square position redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Wiki-T-square.png|thumb|The T-square position]]

These positions are more innovative, and perhaps not as widely known or practiced as the ones listed above.

*The receiving partner lies on their back with knees up and legs apart. The penetrating partner lies on their side perpendicular to the receiver, with the penetrating partner's hips under the arch formed by receiver's legs. This position is sometimes called the ''T-square''.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

*The receiving partner's legs are together turning to one side while looking up towards the penetrator, who has spread legs and is kneeling straight behind the other's hips. The penetrator's hands are on the other's hips. This position can be called the ''modified T-square''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sensualinteractive.com |title=Welcome to Sensual Interactive – Your Sensual Resource Network |publisher=Sensualinteractive.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Seventh Posture]]'' of Burton's translation of ''[[The Perfumed Garden]]'' is an unusual position not described in other classical [[sex manual]]s.&lt;ref name="perfumed garden"/&gt; The receiving partner lies on their side. The penetrating partner faces the receiver, straddling the receiver's lower leg, and lifts the receiver's upper leg on either side of the body onto the crook of penetrating partner's elbow or onto the shoulder. While some references describe this position as being "for acrobats and not to be taken seriously",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hooper|first= Anne J. |title= Anne Hooper's Kama Sutra|publisher= DK Publishing|edition= 1st|year= 1998| isbn= 1-56458-649-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; others have found it very comfortable, especially during [[pregnancy]].
*The ''[[piledriver (sexual)|piledriver]]'' is a difficult position sometimes seen in porn videos. It is described in many ways by different sources. In a heterosexual context, the woman lies on her back, then raises her hips as high as possible, so that her partner, standing, can enter her vaginally or anally. The position places considerable strain on the woman's neck, so firm cushions should be used to support her.
*The receiver lies face down legs spread on the edge of the bed and parallel to the floor, while the penetrator stands behind, holding both legs.
*The ''rusty bike pump'' is similar to a piledriver where penetration is achieved from above at a downward angle with the receiving partner bottom side up.
*[[Autopederasty]], inserting one's own penis into their anus

====Others====
*The receiving partner is on the bottom. The penetrating partner lies on top perpendicularly to them.
*The penetrating partner lies on their back, legs spread. The receiving partner is on their back on top of the penetrator, legs spread, facing the opposite direction.
*The penetrator and the receiver lie on their backs, heads pointed away from one another. Each places one leg on the other's shoulder (as a brace) and the other leg out somewhat to the side.
*The receiving partner lies on their back with the penetrating partner lying perpendicular. The receiving partner bends the knee closest to the penetrating partner's head enough so that there is room for the penetrating partner's waist to fit beneath it, while the penetrating partner's legs straddle the receiving partner's other leg. The in-and-out thrusting action will move more along a side-to-side rather than top-to-bottom axis. This is sometimes called the ''[[Tribadism#Sex positions and other aspects|scissors position]]''. This position allows for breast stimulation during sex, for partners to maintain eye contact if they wish, and for a good view of both partners as they reach orgasm.
*The penetrating partner sits on edge of a bed or chair with feet spread wide on floor. The receiving partner lies on their back on the floor and drapes their legs and thighs over the legs of the penetrating partner. The penetrating partner holds the knees of the receiving partner and controls thrusts.

===Using furniture or special apparatus===
Most sex acts are typically performed on a bed or other simple platform. As the range of supports available increases, so does the range of positions that are possible. Ordinary furniture can be used for this purpose. Also, various forms of [[erotic furniture]] and other apparatus such as [[Sling (furniture)#Slings for sexual activity|fisting sling]]s and [[trapeze]]s have been used to facilitate even more exotic sexual positions.

===Positions to promote or prevent conception===
{{See also|Birth control#Misconceptions}}

Pregnancy is a potential result of any form of sexual activity where [[sperm]] comes in contact with the vagina; this is typically during vaginal sex, but pregnancy can result from anal sex, digital sex (fingering), oral sex, or by another body part, if sperm is transferred from one area to the vagina between a [[Fertility|fertile]] female and a fertile male. Men and women are typically fertile during [[puberty]]. Though certain sexual positions are believed to produce more favorable results than others, none of these are effective means of contraception.

===Positions during pregnancy===
The goal is to prevent excessive pressure on the belly and to restrict penetration as required by the particular partners. Some of the positions below are popular positions for [[sex during pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnancy-info.net/sex_positions.html |title=Pregnancy Resource: Comfortable Sex Positions|publisher=Pregnancy-info.net|date= |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Woman on top: takes the pressure off of the woman's abdomen and allows her to control the depth and frequency of thrusting.
*Woman on back: like the missionary, but with less pressure on abdomen or uterus. The woman lies on her back and raises her knees up towards her chest. The partner kneels between her legs and enters from the front. A pillow is placed under her bottom for added comfort.
*Sideways: also keeps pressure off of her abdomen while supporting her uterus at the same time.
*Spooning: very popular positions to use during the late stages of pregnancy; allowing only shallow penetration and relieves the pressure on the stomach.
*Sitting: she mounts the sitting partner, relieving her stomach of pressure.
*[[Doggy style|From behind]]: allowing her to support stomach and breasts.

==Non-exclusively penetrative==

===Oral sex positions===
[[Oral sex]] is genital stimulation by the mouth. It may be penetrative or non-penetrative, and may take place before, during, as, or following intercourse. It may also be performed [[69 (sex position)|simultaneously]] (for example, when one partner performs cunnilingus, while the other partner performs fellatio), or only one partner may perform upon the other; this creates a multitude of variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexinfo101.com/sp_oralsex.shtml |title=Oral Sex Positions|publisher=Sexinfo101.com|date= |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fellatio====
[[File:Wiki-fellatio02.png|thumb|Modern drawing of fellatio]]
''[[Fellatio]]'' is oral sex performed on a penis. Possible positions include:
* '''Sitting'''
** The receiver lies on his back while the partner kneels between his legs.
** The receiver lies on his back while the partner lies off to the side of their legs.
** The receiver sits in a chair the partner kneels in front of them between their legs.
* '''Standing'''
** The receiver stands while the partner either kneels in front of them or sits (in a chair or on the edge of a bed, etc.) and bends forward.
** The receiver stands while the partner, also standing, bends forward at the waist.
** The receiver stands or crouches at the edge of the bed, facing the bed. The active partner lies on the bed with their head hanging over the edge of the bed backward. The receiver inserts their penis into the partner's mouth, usually to achieve ''[[deep throat (sexual act)|deep throat]]'' penetration.
* '''Lying'''
** While the active partner lies on their back, the receiver assumes the missionary position but adjusted forward.
** The active partner (with breasts) lies on their back, and the receiver inserts their penis between the breasts, and into the mouth.

====Cunnilingus====
[[File:Detail of Édouard-Henri Avril (23).jpg|thumb|19th-century depiction of cunnilingus (detail) by [[Paul Avril]]]]
''[[Cunnilingus]]'' is oral sex performed on the vulva and vagina. Possible positions include:
*The receiver lies on her back as in the missionary position. The active partner lies on their front between their legs.
*The active partner sits. The receiver stands facing away and bends at the hips.
*The active partner sits. The receiver stands or squats facing towards partner and may arch her back, to create further stimulation.
*The active partner lies on their back while the receiver kneels with their legs at their sides and their genitals on their mouth. In other words, the receiver sits on the face of her partner.
*The receiver rests on all fours as in the doggy style position. The partner lies on their back with his head under their genitalia. Their feet may commonly extend off the bed and rest on the floor.
*The receiver services their own genitals. Although rarer, some people still find this possible{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}; see [[autofellatio]].
*The receiver stands, possibly bracing themself against a wall. The active partner kneels in front of them.
*The receiver sits on the bed with her their open, the active partner kneels in front of them.
*The receiver is upside-down (standing on hands, held by partner, or using support, such as bondage or furniture), with the active partner standing or kneeling (depending on elevation) in front or behind. Such a position may be difficult to achieve, or maintain for extended time periods, but the rush of blood to the brain can alter stimulation's effect.
*The receiver stands on hands, resting each leg on either side of the active partner's head, with the active partner standing or kneeling facing them. Depending on which way up the receiver is facing, different stimulation and levels of comfort may be available.

====Sixty-nine====
[[File:Wiki-sixtynine.png|thumb|235x235px|The 69 position]]

Simultaneous oral sex between two people is called ''[[69 (sex position)|69]]''. Partners may be female or male. They can lie side-by-side, lie one on top of the other, or stand with one partner holding the other upside down.

====Anilingus====
[[Image:Wiki-analoral.svg|thumb|Woman performing anilingus on another woman]]

Positions for ''[[anilingus]]'', also known as ''butt licking'', ''rimming'', ''anal-oral sex'', ''rimjob'', or ''tossing the salad'', are often variants on those for genital-oral sex. Anilingus can be performed in a number of sex positions including:
*The passive partner is on all fours in the [[doggy position]] with the active partner behind.
*The passive partner is on their back in the [[missionary position]] with their legs up.
*The passive partner on top in the [[69 (sex position)|69]] position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaylifeuk.com/gay-sex-guide/rimming.html |title=Rimming|author=Adam Cowell|work=gaylifeuk.com|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morin, J. (1998). Anal pleasure and Health. Oakland, CA: Down there press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[rusty trombone]]'', in which a male stands while the active partner performs both anilingus from behind, generally from a kneeling position, and also performs [[masturbation]] on the standing partner, thus somewhat resembling someone playing the [[trombone]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;Tate, Jordan. (January 9, 2007) The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms. Publisher [[St. Martin's Press]] {{ISBN|0-312-36298-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other positions===
*''[[Fingering (sexual act)|Fingering]]'' of the [[vulva]], vagina or anus.
*''[[Shocker (hand gesture)|Shocker]]'': simultaneous fingering of the vagina and anus using one hand. The index and middle finger are inserted in the vagina, and the pinky in the anus. A number of variations are possible by using different combinations of fingers in each orifice. This act figures prominently in the ''[[Story of O]]'': shortly after O's arrival at the Chateau, a man grabs her in this way. O is shocked, but she learns to accept this and ruder intrusions. Sometimes colloquially referred to as "Two in the pink, one in the stink."{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
*''[[Fisting]]'': inserting the entire hand into the vagina or anus. This usually requires large amounts of lubricant and relaxation. The hand is usually not actually made into a fist, but instead the thumb is placed between the middle and ring fingers. Fisting can cause [[laceration]] or [[organ perforation|perforation]] of the [[vagina]], [[perineum]], [[rectum]], or [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], resulting in serious injury and even death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=C.

==Non-penetrative==
{{Main|Non-penetrative sex}}
[[Image:Franz von Bayros 003.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Drawing]] by [[Franz von Bayros]] showing an act of fingering]]

''Non-penetrative sex'' or ''frottage'' is generally sexual activity that excludes penetration, and often includes rubbing one's genitals on one's sexual partner. This may include the partner's genitals or buttocks, and can involve different sex positions. As part of [[foreplay]] or to avoid penetrative sex, people engage in a variety of non-penetrative sexual behavior, which may or may not lead to orgasm.

*''[[Mutual masturbation]]'': The manual stimulation of the penis or scrotum in males and the [[clitoris]] or entire vulva in females.  Partners simultaneously stimulating each other's genitals by mutual or simultaneous masturbation, rhythmic inter-genital contact friction or actual penetrative intercourse can lead to orgasm in one partner or the other (or sometimes simultaneously in both).  
*''Dry humping'': frottage while clothed. This act is common, although not essential, in the dance style known as "[[grinding (dance)|grinding]]".
*''[[Handjob]]'' or ''[[fingering (sexual act)|fingering]]'': Manual stimulation of a partner's penis, scrotum, clitoris or entire vulva. Known as "wanking" in the UK, and "fapping" in modern colloquial terms.
*''[[Footjob]]'': using the feet to stimulate the penis.
*''[[Mammary intercourse]]'': using the breasts together to stimulate the penis through the cleavage. (Should not be confused with a "boob job" meaning to have [[Plastic surgery|augmentive surgery]] done on the breasts.) Also called a ''titjob'', ''titty-fucking'', a ''tit-wank''; several other [[slang]] terms exist.
*''[[Axillary intercourse]]'': with the penis in the armpit. Commonly known as "bagpiping".
*''[[Edging (sexual practice)|Orgasm control]]'': By self or by a partner managing the physical stimulation and sensation connected with the emotional and physiologic excitement levels.  Through the practice of masturbation an individual can learn to develop control of their own body's orgasmic response and timing.  In partnered stimulation either partner can control their own orgasmic response and timing.  With mutual agreement either partner can similarly learn to control or enhance their partner's orgasmic response and timing.  Partner stimulation orgasm techniques referred to as expanded orgasm, extended orgasm or orgasm control can be learned and practiced for either partner to refine their control of the orgasmic response of the other.  Partners mutually choose which is in control or in response to the other.
*''[[Orgasmic meditation]]'',&lt;ref name="New York Times: Orgasmic Meditation"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29wwln-safire-t.html|title=Orgasmic &amp; Orgasmic Meditation |publisher=The New York Times|author=William Safire|accessdate=2009-05-05 | date=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a mindfulness practice where the object of [[meditation]] is conscious finger to genital contact.  "OMing" is practiced in pairs, with one partner, gently holding the genitals with both hands, and that partner's index finger gently, precisely, slowly stroking the female’s clitoris specifically and with both parties placing their complete [[awareness]] mindfully on that localized point of contact between them.  Both practitioners focus their fullest attention on their sensitive [[nerve endings]] and on their finest muscle control in stroking movement to develop connective ([[limbic]]) resonance between practitioners. The outcome, is not simply orgasm but interpersonal connection.

The [[Sexual slang|slang]] term ''humping'' may refer to masturbation—thrusting one's genitals against the surface of non-sexual objects, clothed or unclothed; or it may refer to penetrative sex.

===Genital-genital rubbing===
{{Main|Intercrural sex|Frot|Tribadism}}

''Genital-genital rubbing'' (often termed ''GG rubbing'' by [[Primatology|primatologists]] to describe the behavior among female [[bonobo]]s&lt;ref name="songweaver"&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Waal FB |title=Bonobo sex and society |journal=[[Scientific American|Sci.

*''Intercrural sex'', or ''interfemoral sex'': the penis is placed between the partner's thighs, perhaps rubbing the [[vulva]], [[scrotum]] or [[perineum]].
*''Frot'' or ''frottage'': two males mutually rubbing penises together.

{{Main|Group sex}}

Various people of gender and orientation may participate in [[group sex]]. While group sex does not imply that all participants must be in sexual contact with all others simultaneously, some positions are only possible with three or more people.&lt;ref name="Swinger Orgies and Group Sex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swingersocial.com/swinger-blog/?page_id=1248 |title=Differences Between Threesomes, Group Sex and Orgies |publisher=The Swinger Blog |date=October 2010 |accessdate=April 15, 2012 |author=Wojick, Helen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207203029/http://swingersocial.com/swinger-blog/?page_id=1248 |archivedate=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the positions listed above, more group sex positions become practical if [[erotic furniture]] is used.

===Threesomes===
{{Main|Threesome}}

When three people have sex with each other, it is called a ''threesome''. Possible ways of having all partners in sexual contact with each include some of the following:
*One person performs oral sex on one partner while they engage in receptive anal or vaginal intercourse with the other partner. Sometimes called a ''spit roast''.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Slang"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.peevish.co.uk/slang/s.htm | title=Spit Roast Threesome | date=November 1996 | accessdate=April 14, 2012 | author=Duckworth, Ted}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''369'' position is where two people engage in oral sex in the 69 position while a third person positions himself to penetrate one of the others; usually a man engaging in sex doggie-style with the woman on top in the 69 position.&lt;ref name="Sex Position 369"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swingersocial.com/lifestyle-sex-defintions | title=Lifestyle Definitions - 369 | publisher=Swinger Social Network | accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A man has vaginal or anal sex with one partner, while himself being anally penetrated by another (possibly with a [[strap-on dildo]]).
*Three partners lie or stand in parallel, with one between the other two. Sometimes called a ''sandwich''. This term may specifically refer to the ''double penetration'' of a woman, with one penis in her anus, and the other in her vagina or of a male, with two penises in his anus.
*Two participants have vaginal/anal sex with each other, and one/both perform oral sex on a third.
*Three people perform oral/vaginal/anal sex on one another simultaneously, commonly called a ''daisy chain''.
*The slang term ''lucky Pierre'' is sometimes used in reference to the person playing the middle role in a threesome, being anally penetrated while engaging in penetrative anal or vaginal sex.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foursomes===
*A ''469'' is a four-person sexual position where two individuals engage in 69 oral sex while a third and a fourth person both position themselves on each end to penetrate the two engaged in simultaneous oral sex; similar to a 369, with the addition of a fourth person.&lt;ref name="469 Sex Position"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swingersocial.com/lifestyle-sex-defintions | title=Lifestyle Definitions - 469 position | publisher=Swinger Social Network | accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With many participants===
These positions can be expanded to accommodate any number of participants:
*A group of males [[masturbation|masturbating]] is called a ''[[circle jerk (sexual practice)|circle jerk]]''.
*A group of males masturbating and ejaculating on one person's face is known as ''[[bukkake (sex act)|bukkake]]''.&lt;ref name="Lifestyle Definitions"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swingersocial.com/lifestyle-sex-defintions/b | title=Lifestyle Definitions - Bukkake | publisher=Swinger Social Network | accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bukkake | title=Bukkake | publisher=dictionary.com | accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A group of men, women, or both, each performing oral, anal or vaginal sex on the next, is called a ''daisy chain''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swingersocial.com/lifestyle-sex-defintions/d | title=Daisy Chain | publisher=Swinger Social Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/daisy+chain?s=t | title=Daisy Chain | accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When one woman or man is given the serial or parallel attention of many, often involving a queue (''pulling a train''), it is often termed a ''[[gangbang]]''.

===Multiple penetration===&lt;!-- Linked to by the redirects Double penetration &amp; Triple penetration --&gt;
{{commons category|Multiple penetration}}

A person may be sexually penetrated multiple times simultaneously. Penetration may involve use of fingers, toes, [[sex toy]]s, or penises. Scenes of multiple penetration are common in [[pornography]].

If one person is penetrated by two objects, it is generically called ''double penetration'' (''DP'').&lt;ref name="DP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swingersocial.com/lifestyle-sex-defintions/d |title=Double-penetration|publisher=Swinger Social Network|work=Lifestyle Definitions|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double penetration of the [[vagina]], [[Human anus|anus]], or mouth can involve:
*Simultaneous penetration of the anus by two penises or other objects. This is commonly called ''double anal penetration (DAP)'' or ''double stuffing''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
*Simultaneous penetration of the vagina by two penises or other objects. This is commonly called ''double vaginal penetration (DVP)'' or ''double stuffing''.&lt;ref name="DVP"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.swingersocial.com/lifestyle-sex-defintions/d |title=Double vaginal penetration|publisher=Swinger Social Network|work=Lifestyle Definitions|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Simultaneous penetration of the vagina and anus. If this is done using penises and/or [[strap-on dildo]]s, this is sometimes called the ''sandwich'' or ''BigMac''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The ''[[shocker (hand gesture)|shocker]]'' (see above) accomplishes this using several fingers of one hand.{{anchor|Spit roast}}
*Simultaneous penetration of the mouth and either the vagina or anus. If the penetrating objects are penises, this is sometimes called the ''spit roast'', the ''Chinese finger trap'', or the ''Eiffel tower''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Number of positions, and effects on physical abilities==
In 1974, [[Alex Comfort]] categorized more than 600&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1974) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gershon Legman]] categorized 3,780.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1974) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; However, the suggestion that the number of positions that can be used for sex is essentially limitless also exists.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Rogiere, Jean, "	
The little bit naughty book of sex". Ulysses Press. 2001. {{ISBN|1569753059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people are limited by physical [[disability|disabilities]] in the sex positions which they may use without pain or other discomfort. Other physical limitations of one or both participants also limit the sex positions which they may adopt. For example, the spoons position is recommended when either partner has back problems; the ''starfish position'' is recommended to achieve orgasms more easily and the missionary position may be uncomfortable for the receiving partner if the weight of the inserting partner, relative to the receiving partner's, is a problem. Also, the standing positions may be unsuitable if there is a significant height difference between the participants, unless the female is being carried.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Shōjo''''', '''''shojo''''' or '''''shoujo'''''|{{linktext|少女}}|{{linktext|shōjo}}}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for "girl".&lt;ref&gt;The word ''girl'' in English has complex meanings, and care is needed in its use. See Francoeur, R.T., Martha Cornog, Timothy Perper, and Norman A. Scherzer 1995 ''The Complete Dictionary of Sexology, New Expanded Edition.'' New York: Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = nb&gt;Because of the difficulty of inputting [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s on many computers, "shôjo" and "shöjo" are also common and acceptable renderings, although "shōjo" is preferred.)&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from a Chinese expression written with the same characters. The [[Chinese character]]s (少 and 女) literally mean ''little'' and ''woman'' respectively.&lt;ref name = "YuenRen"&gt;Yuen Ren Chao and Lien Sheng Yong. 1962. ''[[Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese]]''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. (No ISBN). 少 is radical #42, page 64. 女 is radical #38, page 54, meaning ''woman'' or ''female.'' 女 can be used as either a noun or an adjective.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japanese, these kanji refer specifically to a young woman approximately 7–18 years old.&lt;ref name = Daijisen&gt;[[Shogakukan]] Daijisen Editorial Staff (1998), {{nihongo|''Daijisen''|大辞泉}} (Dictionary of the Japanese language), Revised Edition.

== Etymology ==
Like most [[kanji]] compounds, the term shōjo is borrowed from [[Classical Chinese]] [[Chinese character|character]]s. The original term is written as "少女", which could be pronounced as ''shào nǚ'' in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] ([[pinyin]] romanization), ''so nyŏ'' in [[Korean language|Korean]] ([[McCune-Reischauer]] romanization), ''thiếu nữ'' in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and ''shōjo'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ([[Hepburn romanization]]).

The earliest surviving written record of the term 少女 is on the [[Book of the Later Han]], published in China in the 5th century, in Chapter 86, The myth of [[Yao people|Yao]], referring to young girls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.revised.moe.edu.tw/cgi-bin/newDict/dict.sh?cond=%A4%D6%A4k&amp;pieceLen=50&amp;fld=1&amp;cat=&amp;ukey=1830060051&amp;serial=1&amp;recNo=1&amp;op=f&amp;imgFont=1 Chinese Dictionary, Department of Education of Republic of China]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slovaks in [[Austria]]''' have a history dating back to the early centuries of the Common Era. Currently, there are 35,326 Slovaks in Austria as of 2016. Large communities of Slovaks can be found in [[Vienna]] and [[Lower Austria]], with a smaller community in [[Styria]].

==History==
===Prior to the 20th century===
Between the fifth and ninth centuries AD, Slovaks controlled the eastern part of what is now considered [[Lower Austria]], where many ethnic Slovaks still remain.&lt;ref name="uoc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/document/eslovac/an/i1/i1.html|title=SLOVAK IN AUSTRIA |date=29 May 1998|publisher=Research Centre of Wales|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1880s the 1890s, around 230,000 [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] emigrated to Austria proper, mainly for construction work and other menial labor jobs in the larger cities, particularly [[Vienna]]. At the turn of the century, an estimated 70,000 Slovak speakers in Austria, the vast majority being concentrated in [[Vienna]] and [[Marchfeld]]. Over the next 14 years, this number was decimated to 20,000.&lt;ref name="uoc.edu"/&gt;

===Modern history===
After the foundation of [[Czechoslovak Republic]] in 1918, many Slovaks emigrated back to the [[Slovakia]] region. In the 1923 census, only 5,000 Slovacophones declared their language.&lt;ref name="uoc.edu"/&gt;

In 1976, as part of the Treaties of St. German and Brno and the Austrian Ethnic Groups Act, Slovaks were recognized as an autochthonous ethnicity, and freedom to use the Slovak language officially was permitted.&lt;ref name="uoc.edu"/&gt;

In recent years, many thousands of Slovaks have emigrated from Slovakia, mainly due to the open borders of the [[European Union]]. The population of Slovaks had increased by 800% in 2016.&lt;ref name="uoc.edu"/&gt;

*[[Ludwig Schwarz]], bishop of the [[Diocese of Linz]]
