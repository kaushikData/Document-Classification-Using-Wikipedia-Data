'''AGLA''' ({{Hebrew|אגלא}}) is a [[notariqon]] (kabbalistic acronym) for ''Atah Gibor Le-olam Adonai'',"You, O Lord, are mighty forever." It is said daily in the second blessing of the [[Amidah]], the central [[Jewish]] prayer. [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]] has suggested an arbitrary interpretation of AGLA ({{Hebrew|אגלא}}) as "A the one first, A the one last, G, the [[trinity]] in unity, L, the completion of the [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|Great Work]]."&lt;ref name="isbn0-87728-557-8"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Knorr von Rosenroth, Christian |author2=Mathers, S.

[[File:A Frank Statement.png|thumb|''A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers'']]
'''''A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers'''''&amp;nbsp;was a historic first [[Tobacco advertising|advertisement]] in a campaign&amp;nbsp;run by major American&amp;nbsp;[[tobacco]]&amp;nbsp;[[Tobacco industry|companies]]&amp;nbsp;on January 4, 1954, to create doubt by disputing recent scientific studies linking smoking&amp;nbsp;[[cigarettes]]&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;[[lung cancer]] and other dangerous&amp;nbsp;[[Health effects of tobacco|health effects]].&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tobacco.org/Documents/dd/ddfrankstatement.html|title=Daily Doc: The "Frank Statement" of 1954|last=|first=|date=2017-11-07|website=www.tobacco.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaching an estimated 43 million people through more than 400 newspapers throughout the United States, ''A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers'' and subsequent advertisements were designed by public relations firm [[Hill &amp; Knowlton]] to [[Social engineering (political science)|socially engineer]] the public's perceptions of tobacco and to instill doubt about scientific research linking disease and smoking.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/900540359|title=Up in smoke : from legislation to litigation in tobacco politics|last=Martha|first=Derthick|publisher=CQ Press|year=|isbn=1452202230|edition=Third|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=33–41|oclc=900540359}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of ''A Frank Statement'' and tobacco advertisements that still exist today, the tobacco industry continues to expand its markets by avoiding health concerns and portraying its products in a positive light.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236761/|title=TOBACCO ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION|last=Youths|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Preventing Nicotine Addiction in Children and|last2=Lynch|first2=Barbara S.|last3=Bonnie|first3=Richard J.|date=1994|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

Reports of a link between tobacco and lung cancer emerged as early as 1912, but until the 1950s, the evidence was circumstantial since smoking was so pervasive in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thun|first=Michael J|date=2005|title=When truth is unwelcome : the first reports on smoking and lung cancer : Public Health Classics|url=http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/73130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, hoping to find the cause of the significant surge in lung cancer incidence in the US and England, [[Richard Doll|Dr. Richard Doll]] and [[Austin Bradford Hill|Professor Bradford Hill]] conducted a [[case-control study]] in which [[lung cancer]], other cancer, and non-cancer patients from twenty London-area hospitals were interviewed about their smoking habits. The study, published in the ''[[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'', found that the lung cancer patients were more likely to be heavier smokers than the other cancer and non-cancer control patients.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doll|first=Richard|last2=Hill|first2=A. Bradford|date=1950-09-30|title=Smoking and Carcinoma of the Lung|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=2|issue=4682|pages=739–748|issn=0007-1447|pmc=2038856|pmid=14772469|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4682.739}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results revealed to the medical community that a link between smoking and lung cancer may exist. Smoking was so prevalent that before these results were published, the increase in lung cancer incidence was attributed to the growing presence of automobiles, roads, and factories in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/ep/ep713_history/EP713_History8.html|title=Epidemiology of Chronic Diseases|last=LaMorte|first=Wayne W.|date=October 18, 2017|website=sphweb.bumc.bu.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wynder and Graham Figure 3.png|thumb|Wynder and Graham's study found that lung cancer patients were more likely to be heavier smokers than the other cancer and non-cancer control patients.]]
In 1950, [[Ernst Wynder|Dr. Ernst Wynder]] and [[Evarts Ambrose Graham]] published a study in the [[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]] in which they interviewed 684 people with proven cases of lung cancer about their smoking habits. The study found that heavy and sustained usage of tobacco, especially in the form of cigarettes, increased the likelihood of developing of lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wynder|first=Ernest L.|last2=Graham|first2=Evarts A.|date=1985-05-24|title=Tobacco Smoking as a Possible Etiologic Factor in Bronchiogenic Carcinoma: A Study of Six Hundred and Eighty-Four Proved Cases|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/398680|journal=JAMA|volume=253|issue=20|pages=2986–2994|doi=10.1001/jama.1985.03350440064033|issn=0098-7484|pmc=2623809}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, to study the biological likelihood of cancer being linked to smoking, [[Ernst Wynder|Wynder]] published an animal study in the US journal ''[[Cancer Research (journal)|Cancer Research]]'' that found that tobacco tar was [[carcinogen]]ic when applied to the skin of mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/795182557|title=Drugs-- without the hot air : minimising the harms of legal and illegal drugs|last=Nutt|first=David|date=2012|publisher=UIT|year=|isbn=1906860165|location=Cambridge, England|pages=201–202|oclc=795182557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The&amp;nbsp;December 1952 issue of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' featured an article, titled ''Cancer by the Carton,'' that discussed these recent studies on the link between smoking and lung cancer. The article presented to the public the studies' conclusion that tobacco causes lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/bcm92f00/pdf|title=Cancer by the Carton|last=Norr|first=Roy|date=December 1952|website=legacy.library.ucsf.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;As a result, the article provoked a health scare, which resulted in a small drop in consumption, and a fall in stock prices.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

In 1954, Doll and Hill published another article in the ''British Medical Journal'' releasing the results of the&amp;nbsp;[[British Doctors Study]],&lt;nowiki/&gt;which revealed a significant pattern of increased death from lung cancer as the amount of tobacco smoked increased.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doll|first=Richard|last2=Hill|first2=A. Bradford|date=1954-06-26|title=The Mortality of Doctors in Relation to Their Smoking Habits|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=4877|pages=1451–1455|issn=0007-1447|pmc=2085438|pmid=13160495|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4877.1451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, which were the immediate post-war years and the beginning of the [[Atomic Age|nuclear age]], science was very highly regarded by the public, so the accumulating scientific evidence linking tobacco to lung cancer posed a major threat to the tobacco companies' public image.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Allan M.|date=January 2012|title=Inventing Conflicts of Interest: A History of Tobacco Industry Tactics|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102|issue=1|pages=63–71|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2011.300292|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3490543|pmid=22095331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social engineering ==
With mounting evidence of a link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer, tobacco companies faced a dilemma of whether to admit to or deny the health risks of smoking. In order to preserve their industry, the tobacco companies opted to completely deny health risks. Instead, the tobacco companies crafted a strategy that, through creative advertising and marketing, would manipulate the cultural context surrounding their product from one that regarded the product unfavorably to one that held the product in high esteem. This strategy is known as [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]].&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

On December 15, 1953, led by Paul Hahn, the head of [[American Tobacco Company|American Tobacco]], the six major tobacco companies ([[American Tobacco Company|American Tobacco Co.]], [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]], [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]], [[Benson &amp; Hedges]], [[U.S. Tobacco Company|U.S. Tobacco Co.]], and Brown &amp; Williamson) met with public relations company [[Hill &amp; Knowlton]] in New York City to create an advertisement that would assuage the public's fears and create a false sense of security in order to regain the public's confidence in the tobacco industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-09-18/magazine/tm-40179_1_tobacco-industry|title=Tobacco's Pr Campaign :  The Cigarette Papers|last=Goodman|first=Michael J.|date=1994-09-18|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill and Knowlton's president, [[John W. Hill]], realized that simply denying the health risks would not be enough to convince the public. Instead, a more effective method would be to create a major scientific controversy in which the scientifically established link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer would appear not to be conclusively known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tobaccotactics.org/index.php?title=Hill_%26_Knowlton|title=Hill &amp; Knowlton|last=University of Bath|first=|date=October 17, 2012|website=www.TobaccoTactics.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tobacco companies fought against the emerging science by producing their own science, which suggested that existing science was incomplete and that the industry was not motivated by self-interest.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; With the creation of the [[Tobacco Institute|Tobacco Industry Research Committee]], headed by accomplished scientist [[C. C. Little|C.C. Little]], the tobacco companies manufactured doubt and turned scientific findings into a topic of debate. The recruitment of credentialed scientists like Little who were skeptics was a crucial aspect of the tobacco companies' social engineering plan to establish credibility against [[Tobacco control|anti-smoking reports]]. By amplifying the voices of a few skeptical scientists, the industry created an illusion that the larger scientific community had not reached a conclusive agreement on the link between smoking and cancer.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

Internal documents released through [[whistleblower]]s and [[Lawsuit|litigation]], such as the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]], reveal that while advertisements like ''A Frank Statement'' made tobacco companies appear to be responsible and concerned for the health of their consumers, in reality, they were deceiving the public into believing that smoking did not have health risks. The whole project was aimed at protecting the tobacco companies' images of glamour and all-American individualism at the cost of the public's health.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bates, Clive, and Andy Rowell. "[http://www.who.int/tobacco/media/en/TobaccoExplained.pdf Tobacco Explained]" (PDF). World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims==
''A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers'' claims:
# That medical research of recent years indicates many possible causes of lung cancer.
# That there is no agreement among the authorities regarding what the cause is.
# That there is no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes.
# That statistics purporting to link cigarette smoking with the disease could apply with equal force to any one of many other aspects of modern life. Indeed, the validity of the statistics themselves is questioned by numerous scientists.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;
The claims made in ''A Frank Statement'' were largely false as:
# Recent medical research had indicated that while lung cancer does have many possible causes, smoking is by far the leading cause in many different types of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM195204032461405|title=Some Practical Aspects of Cancer Prevention|last=Wynder|first=Ernest L.|date=April 3, 1952|website=The New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|doi=10.1056/nejm195204032461405|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Most scientists, except for skeptics hired by the tobacco companies, agreed that cigarette smoking is linked to lung cancer incidence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Multiple studies have shown a clear link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
# The studies linking cigarette smoking to lung cancer controlled for the "many other aspects of modern life" to show that cigarette smoking is the main cause.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Many of the "numerous scientists" who questioned the validity of the statistics were under the payroll of the tobacco companies.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

==Promises==
The advertisement also made several promises on behalf of the tobacco industry which were later disputed by the scientific community. In ''A Frank Statement,'' the tobacco companies stated that they believed that their products were safe; however, in a 2002 assessment of the promises made by the advertisement, it was concluded that some tobacco industry scientists believed that there was a [[Causality|causal relationship]] between tobacco and cancer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummings|first=K. M.|last2=Morley|first2=C. P.|last3=Hyland|first3=A.|date=March 2002|title=Failed promises of the cigarette industry and its effect on consumer misperceptions about the health risks of smoking|journal=Tobacco Control|volume=11 Suppl 1|pages=I110–117|doi=10.1136/tc.11.suppl_1.i110|issn=0964-4563|pmc=1766060|pmid=11893821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research was undertaken to find a safer cigarette, but tobacco companies realized that they could not produce a safer cigarette because doing so would mean admitting that current cigarettes were not safe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, the industry responded to the growing public concern by marketing their cigarettes as having [[Cigarette filter|filters]], milder smoke, and lower tar and [[Nicotine dependence|nicotine]] content; however, they did not acknowledge a causal link with cancer until 1999.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''A Frank Statement'' also pledged "aid and assistance to the research effort into all phases of tobacco use and health," and announced the establishment of the [[Tobacco Institute|Tobacco Industry Research Committee]] (TIRC) to work towards that goal.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Much of the TIRC funded research was not directly connected to smoking as it focused mainly on cancer basics, such as [[immunology]], [[genetics]], [[cell biology]], [[pharmacology]], and [[virology]], rather than cancer's connection to smoking.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Neither the TIRC nor its successor, the Council for Tobacco Research, ever acknowledged a proven link between smoking and serious and/or life-threatening illness. When research did find a link between smoking and cancer, however, the findings were rarely reported to the public.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite the irrelevance of much of the TIRC funded research to the health effects of smoking, the tobacco industry continued to publicize its funding of the TIRC to reassure the public.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In reality, the TIRC was created as a public relations measure for the purposes of discrediting independent science and portraying the tobacco companies as transparent and concerned for the well-being of their customers.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

Finally, the advertisement promised that the tobacco companies "always have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public health."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; According to Cummings, Morley, and Hyland, "there is abundant evidence that the tobacco industry went to great lengths to undermine tobacco control efforts of the public health community."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An example of this is a memo from the vice-president of the [[Tobacco Institute]] in which the industry's strategy was described as "creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it", and "advocating the public's right to smoke, without actually urging them to take up the practice."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By proclaiming that the health risks were not conclusively linked to smoking, the tobacco companies manipulated the situation to place all liability on the consumer rather than on themselves.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

== Impact on the public ==
Although the tobacco industry claims that their advertising is only used to convince current smokers to switch between brands and that it does not increase total cigarette consumption, research into the effects of advertising shows that it plays an essential role in projecting positive connotations of smoking cigarettes onto potential new smokers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From 1954, when Hill &amp; Knowlton first started working with the tobacco industry, to 1961, the number of cigarettes sold annually rose from  369 billion to 488 billion, and the annual per capita consumption rose from 3344 to 4025 cigarettes.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

The [[Tobacco advertising|first cigarette advertisements]] claimed that smoking cigarettes had a variety of health benefits, such as prolonged youth, thinness, and attractiveness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, as more research revealed the deceptiveness of these claims, tobacco companies began to use advertisements, like ''A Frank Statement,'' to deny that their products caused cancer. Claiming that advertisement bans would infringe on "commercial [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]," the tobacco industry has continually fought against them; however, the industry has never responded to criticism that much of its advertising, like the claims made in ''A Frank Statement,'' is deceptive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, the tobacco industry's manipulation of science as a public relations tactic is still used today in debates on a wide variety of subjects including [[global warming]], [[Genetically modified organism|food]], and [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownell|first=Kelly D.|last2=Warner|first2=Kenneth E.|date=March 2009|title=The perils of ignoring history: Big Tobacco played dirty and millions died. How similar is Big Food?|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=87|issue=1|pages=259–294|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00555.x|issn=1468-0009|pmc=2879177|pmid=19298423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern-day examples ==
Today, tobacco companies continue to aggressively advertise cigarettes. As cigarette consumption has declined in the United States, tobacco companies have greatly increased their advertising expenditure. In 1991, the industry spent $4.6 billion on advertising and promoting cigarette consumption,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and in 2015, tobacco companies spent $8.9 billion on advertising just in the United States.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/tobacco_industry/marketing/index.htm|title=CDC - Fact Sheet - Tobacco Industry Marketing - Smoking &amp; Tobacco Use|last=Health|first=CDC's Office on Smoking and|date=2017-11-16|website=Smoking and Tobacco Use|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco companies continue to use this money to fund social engineering techniques, such as campaigns featuring themes of social desirability and specific cultural references, to target women, children, and specific racial/ethnic communities.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, to make cigarettes appealing to African American communities, the industry has implemented campaigns that use urban culture and language while sponsoring Chinese and Vietnamese New Year festivals to target Asian Americans.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

With declining levels of smoking in the West due to [[List of smoking bans|smoking bans]] and increased education on the health risks of smoking, tobacco companies have also expanded their market into [[Developing country|developing countries]] to fulfill the industry's ever-present need for new smokers and more money. Using many of the same advertising techniques of glamour, sex, and independence, the industry has begun to target women and children in Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where government bans and health education may not be as prevalent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Johann Heinrich Füssli 053.jpg|thumb|„Nachtmahr“ (''“Night-mare”''), by [[Johann Heinrich Füssli]] (1802), depicts an ''Alp'' sitting on the sleeper's chest, with a ''mara'' staring through the background.]]
An '''''Alp''''' (plural ''Alpe'' or ''Alpen'') is a supernatural being in [[German folklore]].

Not to be confused with the similarly named [[Alp-luachra]], the ''Alp'' is sometimes likened to a [[vampire]], but its behavior is more akin to that of the [[Incubus (demon)|incubus]]. It is distinct from both of these creatures in that it wears a magic hat called a ''Tarnkappe'', from which it draws its powers. The word ''Alp'' is the German form of the word that comes into English as ''[[elf]]'', both descended from [[Proto-Germanic language|Common Germanic]]. It is also known by the following names: ''trud'', ''mar'', ''mart'', ''mahr'', ''schrat'', and ''walrider''. Many variations of the creature exist in surrounding European areas, such as the [[Druden]] and [[Schratteli]], or [[Old Hag]] in [[English-speaking world|English-speaking countries]].

== In medieval sources ==

In the period before about 1000, the [[Old High German]] word ''alp'' is attested only in a small number of [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]]. It is defined by the ''Althochdeutsches Wörterbuch'' as a "nature-god or nature-demon, equated with the [[Faun]]s of Classical mythology ... regarded as eerie, ferocious beings ... As the [[Mara (folklore)|mare]] he messes around with women".&lt;ref&gt;'Naturgott oder -dämon, den Faunen der antiken Mythologie gleichgesetzt ... er gilt als gespenstisches, heimtückisches Wesen ... als Nachtmahr spielt er den Frauen mit'; Karg-Gasterstädt and Frings 1968–, s.v. ''alb''.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the German word ''Alpdruck'' (literally 'elf-oppression') means 'nightmare'. There is also evidence associating elves with illness, specifically epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Edwards 1994"&gt;Edwards 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, elves are in [[Middle High German]] most often associated with deceiving or bewildering people "in a phrase that occurs so often it would appear to be proverbial: 'die elben/der alp trieget mich' (the elves/elf is/are deceiving me)".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1994, 16–17, at 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The same pattern holds in Early Modern German.&lt;ref&gt;(Stallybrass tr.) {{Harvnb|Grimm|1883|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In Lexer's Middle High German dictwionary under [http://woerterbuchnetz.de/Lexer/?sigle=Lexer&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;lemid=LA00984 alp, alb] is an example: Pf.  arzb. 2 14b= {{Harvnb|Pfeiffer|1863|p=44}} ({{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0QSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA44|title=Zwei deutsche Arzneibücher aus dem 12. und 13. Jh.|last=Pfeiffer|first=F.|year=1863|place=Wien|contribution=Arzenîbuch 2= Bartholomäus" (Mitte 13. Jh.)|ref=harv}}): "Swen der alp triuget, rouchet er sich mit der verbena, ime enwirret als pald niht;" meaning: 'When an ''alp'' deceives you, fumigate yourself with [[verbena]] and the confusion will soon be gone'. The editor glosses ''alp'' here as "malicious, teasing spirit" ({{lang-de|boshafter neckende geist}})&lt;/ref&gt;  This deception sometimes shows the seductive side apparent in English and Scandinavian material:&lt;ref name="Edwards 1994"/&gt; most famously, the early thirteenth-century [[Heinrich von Morungen]]'s fifth ''[[Minnesang]]'' begins "Von den elben virt entsehen vil manic man / Sô bin ich von grôzer lieber entsên" ("full many a man is bewitched by elves / thus I too am bewitched by great love").&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1994, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Elbe'' was also used in this period to translate words for nymphs.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1994, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later medieval prayers, Elves appear as a threatening, even demonic, force. Evidence includes Latin prayers found inscribed in lead amulets from southern Scandinavia and [[Schleswig]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Simek, 'Elves and Exorcism: Runic and Other Lead Amulets in Medieavl Popular Religion', in ''Myths, Legends, and Heroes: Essays on Old Norse and Old English Literature in Honour of John McKinnell'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp. 25-52 ({{ISBN|9780802099471}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous is the fourteenth-century ''Münchener Nachtsegen'', a prayer to be said at night, which includes the lines:&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2007, 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Correspondingly, in the early modern period, elves are described in north Germany doing the evil bidding of witches; [[Martin Luther]] believed his mother to have been afflicted in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1994, 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in Old Norse, however, there are few characters identified as elves. An elf does appear in an account of the parentage of the hero [[Hagen]] (ON Högni) which survives only in the Old Norse ''[[Thidrekssaga|Þiðreks saga]]'' but which was translated from a German text (now lost).&lt;ref&gt;Thidrekksaga. {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6j8JKwyuQoC&amp;pg=PA172|title=Saga Điðriks konungs af Bern|last=Unger|first=Carl Rikard|publisher=Feilberg &amp; Landmarks Forlag|year=1853|page=172}}; Hayme's tr., ch. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Hagen is the product of his mother Oda being impregnated by an elf (ON ''álfr'') while she lies in bed. Otherwise, it seems likely that in the German-speaking world, elves were to a significant extent conflated with [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarves]] ({{lang-gmh|{{linktext|getwerc}}}}).&lt;ref&gt;Motz 1983, esp. 23–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus some dwarves that appear in German heroic poetry have been seen as relating to elves, especially when the dwarf's name is ''[[Alberich]]'', which etymologically means 'elf-powerful'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weston|first=Jessie Laidlay|title=The legends of the Wagner drama: studies in mythology and romance|publisher=C. Scribner's sons |year=1903|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdBNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA144|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; (thus [[Jacob Grimm]] thought that the name echoed the notion of the king of the nation of elves or dwarves).&lt;ref name="Grimm-eng453"&gt;(Stallybrass tr.) {{Harvnb|Grimm|1883|loc=Vol. 2, p. 453}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lurker, Manfred (Ger. 1984, Eng. 1987) ''The Routeledge Dictionary of Gods, Goddesses, Devils and Demons'' p. 9, Routeledge &amp; Kegan, {{ISBN|0-415-34018-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alberich in the epic ''[[Ortnit]]'' is a dwarf of childlike-stature who turns out to be the real father of the titular hero, having raped his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillespie|first=George T.|title=A Catalog of persons named in German heroic literartue|publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1973|page=3, note 3}}, citing {{cite book|last=Hempel|first=Heinrich|title=Nibelungenstudien: Nibelungenlied, Thidrikssaga und Balladen|publisher=C. Winters universitätsbuchhandlung|year=1926|pages=150–|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGkGAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Alberich'' who aids Ortnit is paralleled by the French [[Oberon|Auberon]], who aids [[Huon de Bordeaux]] and whose name derives from ''Alberich''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keightley|1850|p=208}}, citing Grimm says Auberon derives from Alberich by a usual l→u change.&lt;/ref&gt; Auberon entered English literature through [[John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners|Lord Berner]]'s translation of the ''[[chanson de geste]]'' around 1540, then as ''[[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]]'', the king of elves and [[fairies]] in Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (see below).

As the apparent convergence with dwarves suggests, the word ''alp'' declined in use in German after the medieval period, though it still occurs in some fossilised uses, most prominently the word for "nightmare", ''Alptraum'' ("elf dream").&lt;ref&gt;Karg-Gasterstädt and Frings 1968–, s.v. ''albe''; Edward 1994, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of the German elf in later folklore include the [[moss people]]&lt;ref&gt;Thistelton-Dyer, T.F. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10118/10118-8.txt The Folk-lore of Plants, 1889]. Available online by Project Gutenberg. File retrieved 3-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[weisse frauen]] ('white women').&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Jones Company (1930). ''[[The Mythology of All Races]]'' Series, Volume 2 ''Eddic'', Great Britain: Marshall Jones Company, 1930, pp. 221–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In Teutonic [[Continental Germanic mythology|myth and folklore]], ''Alpe'' were considered friendly elf-like beings which lived in the mountains, but eventually turned more negative and malevolent. The characteristic magic that the ''Alpe'' possess also bear the creature much resemblance to the [[Kobold]], particularly [[Hodekin]]. As in English, however, twentieth-century fantasy fiction has helped to reinvigorate the term. J.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;R. Tolkien recommended using the older German form ''Elb'' in his ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1967) and ''Elb, Elben'' was consequently introduced in the 1972 [[German translation of The Lord of the Rings|German translation of ''The Lord of the Rings'']], having a role in repopularising the form in German.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Hall 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-medieval folklore ==

An ''Alp'' is typically male, while the ''[[mara (folklore)|mara]]'' and ''mart'' appear to be more feminine versions of the same creature. Its victims are often females,&lt;ref name="Bunson"&gt;...Normally tormenting the nights and dreams of women, although men and children are also victims. Bunson, Matthew (1993) ''The Vampire Encyclopedia'' p. 4, 5, Gramercy, {{ISBN|0-517-16206-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Curran"&gt;Curran, Dr. Bob (2005),''Vampires: A Field Guide to the Creatures that Stalk the Night'' p. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, Career Press, {{ISBN|1-56414-807-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom it attacks during the night, controlling their dreams and creating horrible nightmares (hence the German word ''Alptraum'' ["elf dream"], meaning a nightmare). An ''Alp'' attack is called an ''Alpdruck'', or often ''Alpdrücke'', which means "elf pressure". ''Alpdruck'' is when an ''Alp'' sits astride a sleeper's chest and becomes heavier until the crushing weight awakens the terrified and breathless dreamer. The victim awakes unable to move under the ''Alp''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s weight. This may have been an early explanation for [[sleep apnea]] and [[sleep paralysis]], as well as [[night terror]]s. It may also include [[lucid dream]]s. 
 
Sexual attacks by the ''Alp'' are rare.&lt;ref name="Guiley"&gt;[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary Ellen]] (2004) ''The Encyclopedia of Vampires, Werewolves, and Other Monsters'' p. 20, Visionary Living, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8160-4685-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Alp'' is often associated with vampires because it will drink blood from the nipples of men and young children,&lt;ref name="Mayberry"/&gt; though women are the preferred victim of the invariably male ''Alp'', for it favors the taste of [[breast milk]].

''Alpe'' also exhibit a tendency for mischief similar to elves, like souring milk and re-diapering a baby; a maid must [[sign of the cross|sign a cross]] on the diaper or the ''Alp'' will put the soiled diaper back on her child.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/nightmare.html&lt;/ref&gt; They also enjoy tangling hair into "[[Fairy-locks|elfknot]]s" or chewing and twisting horse's tails. They will ride a horse to exhaustion during the night and may sometimes crush smaller farm animals such as geese to death during a pressing attack. ''Alpe'' are also similarly blamed for minor illnesses and milking cows dry, for they enjoy the taste of cow's milk as well.

The ''Alp'', in many cases, is considered a [[demon]], but there have been some instances in which the ''Alp'' is created from the spirits of recently dead relatives, more akin to a spirit or ghost.
Children may become an ''Alp'' if a woman bites a [[horse collar]] to ease the pain during an extremely long and tortuous childbirth. Also, a child born with a [[caul#Obstetrics|caul]] or hair on the palms may become an ''Alp''. If a woman who is pregnant is frightened by an animal, the child may be born an ''Alp''. Stillborn infants are also suspected to return from the grave as ''Alpe'' and torment their family. People who have eyebrows that meet are suspected to be ''Alpe''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/nightmare.html "Night-mares: Demons that Cause Nightmares"]&lt;/ref&gt;
As with the case of werewolves, sometimes a normal human or animal may become an ''Alp'' during the night. They are typically unaware of their nocturnal activities and are invariably in disguise while doing so. Finding an ''Alp'' while it is not active simply requires injuring or otherwise marking it during one of its attacks, and seeking out the being with a similar mark during the day. The person can then be cured if it is found out who sent them the curse, or how they became cursed to begin with. [[Witchcraft]] is often the prime suspect in this case.&lt;ref name="Curran"/&gt;

Sometimes an ''Alp'' is a spirit summoned by a witch or an evil person wishing harm on another, and sent to torment them. Tricking an ''Alp'' may lead a person to its master.

=== Characteristics ===

The ''Alp'' is best known for its [[shapeshifting]] abilities, similar to the creatures from [[werewolf]] lore. It may change into a [[cat]], [[pig]], [[dog]], [[snake]] or a small white [[butterfly]].&lt;ref name="Mayberry"&gt;Mayberry, Jonathan ''Vampire Universe'' p. 14, 15, Citadel Press Books {{ISBN|0-8065-2813-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been said that it can fly like a [[bird]] and ride a [[horse]]. The ''Alp'' always wears a hat, giving it an almost comical appearance.&lt;ref name="Bunson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guiley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayberry"/&gt; The hat is known as a ''Tarnkappe''&lt;ref name="Mayberry"/&gt; (the literal translation being "[[camouflage]] cap" or "cap of concealment") which is simply a hat (or less commonly a [[veil]]) that gives the ''Alp'' magic powers and the ability to turn [[invisibility|invisible]] while worn (see also [[cloak of invisibility]]). The hat is visible no matter what shape the ''Alp'' takes. An ''Alp'' who has lost this hat will offer a great reward for its safe return.&lt;ref name="Bunson"/&gt; The ''Alp'' also possesses an "[[evil eye]]" whose gaze will inflict illness and misfortune. Removing or damaging this eye also removes the ''Alp''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s malicious intentions.

Protections against an ''Alp'' include laying a broomstick under a [[pillow]], iron [[horseshoe]]s hung from the bedpost, placing shoes against the bed with the toes pointing toward the door, or placing a [[mirror]] on the chest. Steel and crosses are also used. If awoken by the ''Alp'' and finding him still there, one can address him by asking him to return in the morning to borrow something or have coffee. The ''Alp'' will dash away at once, arriving in the morning either in his "true" form, or else in the form of a human with eyebrows that meet to receive his gifts. The creature can be convinced to leave the victim alone at this time, but the ''Alp'' will beg pitifully and at length not to be turned away. 
Plugging up any holes, specifically keyholes, before a visitation will keep the ''Alp'' out. Plugging them during a visitation will invariably seal it inside the room, as they can leave only through their original entrance. A light kept constantly on during the night will also effectively ward off an ''Alp''. A sentry may also be employed to wait and watch for the ''Alp'' to attack the helpless sleeper, the ''Alp'' may be driven away if caught by someone not under the ''Alp''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s influence. Similar to the German [[Neuntoter]], ''Alpe'' are weakened or immobilized by shoving a lemon in its mouth should it be caught resting during the day. The ''Alp'' appears all but impossible to kill, and sometimes even after being turned away it may reappear years later in a worse mood.&lt;ref name="Mayberry"/&gt;

The '''Archangelsk Gospel''' ({{lang-ru|Архангельское Евангелие}}) is a lectionary in Old Church Slavonic dated to 1092. It is the fourth oldest Eastern Slavic manuscript.&lt;ref name = "Башлыкова"&gt;Башлыкова М. Е., ''Архангельское Евангелие'', т.3, стр. 495 Moscow, (2001), {{ISBN|5-89572-008-0}}  [http://www.pravenc.ru/text/76448.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The book is stored in the collection of the [[Russian State Library]].  [[UNESCO]]  added the Arkhangelsk Gospel to the international register [[Memory of the World Programme]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=UNESCO |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23141&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Archangel Gospel of 1092 |accessdate=2009-12-10 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60vtHQznh?url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/homepage// |archivedate=2011-08-14 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arkhangelsk Gospel has a modest design and is a cheap, mass-produced book. The story of its creation and provenance until 1876 is unknown. The book was brought to Moscow by a farmer from the [[Archangelsk]] region and is named after its place of discovery. The manuscript is in satisfactory condition - the ink and [[vermilion]] has crumbled in places, but the [[Vellum|parchment]] does not have signs of contamination or moisture. The Archangel Gospel was reproduced in 1912 as a facsimile and in 1997 as a scientific publication.

== History of the manuscript ==
The early history of the manuscript and place of its provenance are unknown before 1876. There are some suggestions that it came from the scriptorium of the Lazarevsky monastery near [[Great Novgorod]], but there is no unambiguous evidence to support the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="пуцко"&gt;{{cite book

| number    = 3 (5)
| pages     = 46–47
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early December 1876 the manuscript was brought to Moscow by a peasant from Arkhangelsk region and was acquired by a [[Rumyantsev Museum]] trustee, merchant, [[Old believers|old believer]] S. T. Bolshakov. He showed it to other bibliophiles and then offered to sell it to the Rumyantsev Museum for 400 rubles. Several experts worked with the manuscript in the museum, including E. B. Autograph, [[Panteleimon Kulish|P. A. Kulish]] and A. L. Duvernoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that it was written in 1192 because of the date of the scribe ending work on the manuscript ( [[Cyrillic numerals]] "[[Byzantine calendar|from the creation of the world]]" - ҂ ЅѰ). At the request of [[Danilov Monastery]] dean [[paleographer]] Amphilochius (Sergius-Kazantsev), who worked at the time on Old Slavonic-Greek-Russian Dictionary using 11th and 12th-century manuscripts, Bolshakov took the Archangelsk Gospel from the museum and lent it to Amphilochius for study.

The paper used for this edition has approximately the same thickness as the parchment of the original codex.&lt;ref name="дурново"/&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Archangel Gospel 03.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Folio 38 verso of the codex&lt;/center&gt;]]
The manuscript consists of 178 pages of different sizes ranging from 20×16 centimetres to 20.5×16.8&amp;nbsp;cm. The tops of the leaves have been cut off with damage of numbering of the [[Paper quire|quires]]. The manuscript is written on parchment made from calf skins. Experts describe the quality of the material as low: rough manufacture of the leather, very economical open. Fifty-four pages have various defects: rough fields which have been not sewn up or have unfilled holes, the filed parts of the leaves. The Archangel Gospel is in a satisfactory condition; the parchment is not polluted, and traces of moisture are absent, but a number of sheets show traces of wormholes. It appears that some sheets had ink and [[cinnabar]] droplets fall on them, but this does not interfere with the text's legibility. As the restoration of the manuscript from the moment of its discovery was never successful, the manuscript needs a new binding of the book block and strengthening of reliure.&lt;ref name="лев"&gt;{{cite book

The manuscript lost six of the 8-folios quires (three in the beginning, two between leaves 84 and 85, one between leaves 100 and 101) and five separate leaves — together 53 leaves are lost. Separately last leaf of the manuscript is sewn to the book block with the text-[[palimpsest]] (presumably 12th century), written on the old washed off text.

The main text of the manuscript was written by two scribes. It is believed, that the work of these scribes was distributed before work was started. As it « was done, possibly, for acceleration it is difficult to assume an opportunity of using the general original ».&lt;ref name = "Башлыкова"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first scribe copied the text of the Gospels [[lectionary]] (''Evangelistarium'') which goes back to [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Cyril and Methodius]] translation of the Gospels. The professor A. Voskresensky considers, that this text concerns to the most ancient Slavic translations of the four Gospels and represents the so-called Yugoslavian edition closest to initial translation of Cyril and Methody.&lt;ref name="георг"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the Archangel Gospel contains a number of readings has the order distinct from readings of the [[Ostromir Gospel]], and also there are inserts absent in the Gospel (for example, addition of lessons in a weekday from [[Easter]] to Pentecost).&lt;ref name="быч"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second scribe copied the text of the full Gospel-lectionary which sample was not kept, but by its text from the Archangel Gospel, it has essential distinctions on structure and sequences of evangelical readings from the [[Mstislav Gospel]] (it is written till 1117), most ancient of kept full of lectionary markings.

Although ink and cinnabar used for initial letters partially fell off some pages the general state of manuscript is acceptable because its calf parchment pages are clean and dry. It has never been restored. The manuscript is kept in the holdings of [[Russian State Library]] in Moscow.

The first facsimile reprint of the Archangel Gospel was published in 1912, in 1997 there was a second annotated reprint.

The Archangel Gospel was included into the [[UNESCO]]’s [[Memory of the World Register]] – Europe and North America Memory of the World Register – in 1997 in recognition of its historical significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = unesco.org| url = http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23141&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html| title = Archangel Gospel of 1092 | accessdate = 2009-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scribes of the codex ==
[[File:Archangel Gospel 02.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Folio 84 of the codex&lt;/center&gt;]]
The manuscript was written by two scribes (according to the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]], their names were — Michka and presbyter Peter), and also the third scribe (Jakim or Akim), who is responsible for the 175—177 sheets (with Sunday Gospel lessons) and the fourth, which name is unknown — who wrote only leaf 178 (Gospel lessons at date of [[Archangel Michael]]).&lt;ref name="георг" /&gt; The handwriting of the two last scribes is dated [[Palaeography|palaeographically]] to the 13th–14th centuries.&lt;ref name="лев"/&gt; According to N. N. Durnovo the fourth scribe was a contemporary for the first two scribes and dates its work to the end of the 11th century, or to the beginning of the 12th century.

In the end written the fourth scribe writing existed a certain text which at the moment of detection of the manuscript to disassemble it was inconvenient. The chemical way of restoration of the text had completely destroyed this text.&lt;ref name="дурново" /&gt; The manuscript is written by the documentary hands, the letters have essential deviations from the classical style according to which other monuments of that period were written (e.g. Ostromir Gospel).

'''BioSimGrid''' was a project to make [[data sets]] from [[computer simulations]] in the field of [[modelling biological systems]], particularly [[biomolecular structure]]s, more accessible to researchers. The project began in 2004 and halted by 2009.

In 2004 designers presented the concept of the project as a "[[protein data bank]] extended in time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tai|first1=Kaihsu|last2=Murdock|first2=Stuart|last3=Wu|first3=Bing|last4=Ng|first4=Muan Hong|last5=Johnston|first5=Steven|last6=Fangohr|first6=Hans|last7=Cox|first7=Simon J.|last8=Jeffreys|first8=Paul|last9=Essex|first9=Jonathan W.|last10=P.

Apple's '''Bonjour Sleep Proxy''' service is an [[open source]]&lt;ref&gt;Note:  see 

mDNSResponder source code at [http://www.macosforge.org www.macosforge.org], which includes a full implementation of the DNS-SD/mDNS Sleep Proxy Service, available under the Apache 2.0 Open Source license.&lt;/ref&gt;
component of [[zero configuration networking]], designed to assist in [[power management|reducing power consumption]] of [[Computer network|networked]] electronic devices.&lt;ref name="mdns07"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2010-05-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A device acting as a '''sleep proxy server''' will respond to Multicast DNS queries for another, compatible device which has gone into [[sleep mode|low power mode]].  The ''low-power-mode'' device remains ''asleep'' while the sleep proxy server responds to any [[Multicast DNS]] queries.&lt;ref name="mdns07" /&gt;

When the sleep proxy server sees a query which requires the ''low-power-mode'' device to ''wake up'', the sleep proxy server sends a special [[Wake-on-LAN#Magic_packet|wake-up-packet]] ("magic packet")  to the low-power-mode device.  Finally, communication parameters are updated via [[Multicast DNS]] and normal communications proceed.&lt;ref name="mdns07" /&gt;

Apple Inc. describes the service as '''Bonjour Sleep Proxy''' in their support documents.&lt;ref name="apple-support-doc"&gt;{{cite web

== Details ==

=== Address resolution protocol ===

The sleep proxy service responds to [[address resolution protocol]] requests on behalf of the low-power-mode device:&lt;ref name="mdns07" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When a sleep proxy sees an IPv4 ARP or IPv6 ND Request for one of the sleeping device's addresses, it answers on behalf of the sleeping device, without waking it up, giving its own MAC address as the current (temporary) owner of that address.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This may appear confusing to network administrators who are not expecting the behaviour of changing [[MAC addresses]].

=== Wireless magic packet ===

In case the low-power-mode device is communicating via [[Wi-Fi]], the wake-up-packet is sent via [[Wireless Multimedia Extensions]] (WMM).&lt;ref name="macworld-glenn" /&gt;  This was not possible in previous implementations of [[Wake on LAN]] (WoL).  The wireless hardware must be updated enough to include WMM support.&lt;ref name="macworld-glenn" /&gt; Apple provides instructions for checking compatibility with this feature for Macintosh computers.&lt;ref name="apple-support-doc" /&gt;

=== Supported services and examples ===

The sleep proxy service is able to advertise any [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]]-supported services, while the host computer sleeps. Some examples of supported services are:&lt;ref name="apple-support-doc" /&gt;

* [[File sharing]]: a host supporting the sleep proxy service, which offers file services, may go to sleep as needed.  When someone needs to access shared files, the host will wake up automatically.
* [[Digital Audio Access Protocol|iTunes library sharing]]: the computer hosting the [[iTunes]] library may go to sleep, and will automatically wake when someone wishes to browse the iTunes library from a different PC.
* [[Printer sharing]]: a printer may be connected and shared from a computer supporting sleep proxy service.  The computer can go to sleep when not in use, but will wake when needed to service a print job being sent from a different computer.
* [[Secure Shell|SSH]]: a computer offering SSH access may go to sleep, and awaken via the sleep proxy service when an SSH login is initiated.
* [[Desktop sharing]]: similar to above examples.

=== Troubleshooting ===

[[Stuart Cheshire]] has a [http://stuartcheshire.org/SleepProxy/index.html page describing steps for troubleshooting Sleep Proxy Service].

'''''British Phaenogamous Botany''''' is figures and descriptions of British flowering plants compiled by the botanist [[William Baxter (Oxford Botanic Garden curator)|William Baxter]].

==Description==
The six volumes were published in [[Oxford]] by J.H. Parker between 1832 and 1843.  

The 509 hand-coloured copper-engraved plates were accompanied by botanical descriptions in 8vo. To illustrate this work on the British flora, Baxter employed two local artists—Isaac Russell (an Oxford glass painter) and C. Matthews. The plates were hand-coloured by Baxter's daughters and daughter-in-law.

|Packages the flash memory, currently soldered in shipping smartphones, into a removable card form factor.  Uses the SCSI command set including queuing. The electrical interface makes use of [[differential signaling]], which enables high bus speeds and robustness under noisy conditions and reduced pin count (compared to parallel bus alternatives such as [[UHS-I]]).

== Physical details ==
Note that a memory card's dimensions are determined while holding the card with contact pins upwards. The length of cards is often greater than their width. Most cards show a directional arrow to aid insertion; such an arrow should be upward.

== Compatibility ==
The following chart gives details on availability of adapters to put a given card (horizontal) in a given slot or device (vertical). This table '''does not take into account protocol issues''' in communicating with the device.

Following labels are used:

* '''+''' (native) – A slot is native for such card.
* '''D''' ('''D'''irectly compatible) – A card may be used in such a slot directly, without any adapters. Best possible compatibility.
* '''M''' (requires a '''M'''echanical adapter) – Such adapter is only a physical enclosure to fit one card sized into another; all electrical pins are exactly the same.
* '''EM''' (requires an '''E'''lectro-'''M'''echanical adapter) – Such adapter features both physical enclosure and pins re-routing as terminals are sufficiently different. No powered elements in such adapter exists, thus they're very cheap and easy to manufacture and may be supplied as a bonus for every such card.
* '''E''' (requires an '''E'''lectronic adapter enclosure) – These adapters must have components—potentially requiring external power—that transform signals, as well as physical enclosure and pin routing.
* '''X''' (requires an e'''X'''ternal adapter) – Technically the same as '''E''', but such adapter usually consists of 2 parts: a pseudo-card with pin routing and physical enclosure size that perfectly match the target slot and a break-out box (a [[card reader]]) that holds a real card. Such adapter is the least comfortable to use.
* '''XM''' (requires an e'''X'''ternal electro-mechanical adapter) – Technically the same as '''EM''', but such adapter usually consists of 2 parts: a pseudo-card with pin routing and physical enclosure size that perfectly match the target slot and a break-out box (a [[card reader]]) that holds a real card. Such adapter is the least comfortable to use.
* ''Empty cell'' – Card cannot be used in such slot, no single adapter is known to exist. Sometimes a chain of adapters can help (for example, miniSD→CF as miniSD→SD→CF).

| style="background:#fcc;"| E&lt;ref name="microsd2xd"&gt;In March 2008, Olympus started shipping the '''MASD-1''' microSD-to-xD adapter along with its latest compact digital cameras, with a shape designed to fit only in [http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/oima_microSD.asp those latest cameras].  The physical adapter is in fact purely ''electromechanical'', although the xD and SD protocols are ''completely incompatible''.  This demonstrates that the cameras themselves must understand the SD protocol, and thus the adapter is more properly termed an electronic adapter, with the electronic logic contained in the camera rather than the physical accessory.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4992">A '''compliments slip''' (or '''with compliments slip''') is a slip of paper that contains the same name and address information that would be on a [[letterhead]] of formal letter stationery, the pre-printed [[salutation]] "with compliments" or "with our/my compliments", and space afterwards for a short handwritten message to be added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The design manual|author=David Whitbread|pages=73|publisher=UNSW Press|year=2001|isbn=9780868406589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Explore Essential English|author=Mark Slim|pages=461|publisher=A.D.R. London Limited|year=2003|isbn=9781901197129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Edexcel /&gt; It is used in correspondence, as an enclosure for other material.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

Compliments slips, which are informal, can sometimes substitute for more formal letters of reply.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; For example, the response to a request for a product catalogue or a price list may simply be the price list or catalogue, with a compliments slip attached, rather than with a formal letter of reply.&lt;ref name=Edexcel&gt;{{cite book|title=Edexcel leisure and tourism GCSE|author1=Diane Canwell |author2=Jonathan Sutherland |pages=231|publisher=Nelson Thornes|year=2003|isbn=9780748780310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Model business letters, e-mails &amp;amp; other business documents|author1=Shirley Taylor |author2=Leonard Gartside |pages=64|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2004|isbn=9780273675242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of compliments slips in responses to such routine requests is often seen by businesses as a necessary step in maintaining good public relations.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The encyclopedia of ephemera|author1=Maurice Rickards |author2=Michael Twyman |author3=Sally De Beaumont |author4=Amoret Tanner |article=compliments slip|pages=103|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=9780415926485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no fixed size for compliments slips. They may vary in size from the size of a business or [[visiting card]], from which compliments slips originally evolved, to the size of a whole sheet of letter writing paper.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Eric Bain recommends that they be of a size suitable for placing inside an envelope without more than one fold, and large enough to be noticed when included in a parcel.&lt;ref name=Bain /&gt; (Standard letter stationery outside the U.S. often requires folding twice in order to be placed inside envelopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Designer's Toolkit|author=Graham Davis|pages=88|publisher=Chronicle Books|year=2007|isbn=9780811860512}}&lt;/ref&gt;) To this end he recommends that compliments slips be size [[ISO 216#A series|A6]] paper.&lt;ref name=Bain&gt;{{cite book|title=The theory and practice of typographic design|author=Eric K. Bain|pages=95|publisher=Hastings House|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller recommends size A5 for stationery that doubles up as both compliments slip and headed letter paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Starting and running a sandwich-coffee bar|author=Stephen Miller|pages=72|publisher=How To Books Ltd|year=2002|isbn=9781857038057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since they are informal, compliments slips are not substitutes in those cases where a formal letter is required for legal reasons. In building contract work, for example, a drawing or a copy letter sent to a [[General contractor|contractor]] with a compliments slip attached is not a formal instruction to perform the work on the drawing or letter. It is at most an invitation to perform that work, at no charge to the employer. A valid instruction would be a formal letter of instruction, or an instruction provided on a printed "Architect's Instruction" form (signed by the architect).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|encyclopedia=Building Contract Dictionary|author=David Chappell, [[Vincent Powell-Smith]], Derek Marshall, and Simon Cavender |article=Instructions |pages=219|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2001|isbn=9780632039647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falconer states that a compliments slip should never be sent instead of a personal letter, and that it is better to send a personal letter in response to a customer enquiry, because it provides a personal touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Good English&amp;mdash;How to Speak and Write It|author=Angus D. Falconer|chapter=Business latters and how to write them|pages=376|publisher=READ BOOKS|year=2008|isbn=9781443702904}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hailey recommends an alternative strategy for providing a personal touch: removing the salutation from compliments slips, thus forcing the entire note to be hand-written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kickstart Marketing|author=Linda Hailey|pages=234|publisher=Allen &amp;amp; Unwin|year=2001|isbn=1-86508-387-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Copyright transfer agreements became common in the publishing business after the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] in the United States and similar legislation in other countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1107/S0021889878012753 | title = Transfer of Copyright | journal = Journal of Applied Crystallography | volume = 11 | pages = 63–64 | year = 1978 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; redefined copyright as accruing to the author from the moment of creation (rather than publication) of a work.&lt;ref name=Bachrach1998/&gt; This required publishers to acquire copyrights from the author in order to sell the works or access to it, and written statements signed by the rights owner became necessary in order for the copyright transfer to be considered valid.&lt;ref name=Friedman1982/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#204 Section 204] of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
{{Quotation|The situation in which authors hold the copyright usually involves considerable effort in the form of correspondence and record keeping and often leads to unnecessary delays. Although this may appear to be trivial for a few requests, a good scholarly journal publishing exciting papers can expect several hundred requests per year; a task of this magnitude can become onerous. On the other hand, if the Journal holds the copyright, requests, value judgements, and permissions can be handled expeditiously to the satisfaction of all concerned.|J. Lagowski (1982)&lt;ref name=Lagowski1982/&gt;}}

Granting publishers the permission to copy, display and distribute the work is necessary for publishers to act as such, and copyright transfer agreements across a wide range of publishers have such provisions.&lt;ref name=Gadd2003-4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gaeta | first1 = T. J. | title = Authorship: "Law" and Order | doi = 10.1111/j.1553-2712.1999.tb00393.x | journal = Academic Emergency Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 297–301 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10230981| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reach of copyright transfer agreements can go well beyond that, and "[s]ome publishers require that, to the extent possible, copyright be transferred to them."&lt;ref name=Friedman1982/&gt; This means that no one, including the authors, can reuse text, tables, or figures in other publications without first getting permission from the new copyright owner.&lt;ref name="understand"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berquist | first1 = T.

Copyright transfer agreements also ask that the authors confirm to actually own the copyright for all the materials pertaining to a given act of publishing, and that the item for which the copyright is to be transferred has not been previously published and is not under consideration to be published elsewhere,&lt;ref name="understand"/&gt; to limit the frequency of [[duplicate publication]] and [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref name=Gadd2003-4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = I.

== Criticisms ==
Critics have said that the copyright transfer agreement in commercial scholarly publishing is "as much about ensuring long–term asset management as it is about providing service to the academic community" because the practice seems to grant favor to the publisher in a way that does not obviously benefit the authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willinsky|first=John|title=Copyright Contradictions in Scholarly Publishing|journal=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]|date=4 November 2002|volume=7|issue=11|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1006/927|accessdate=20 February 2012|doi=10.5210/fm.v7i11.1006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright transfer agreements often conflict with [[self-archiving]] practices&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gadd | first1 = E. | last2 = Oppenheim | first2 = C. | last3 = Probets | first3 = S. | doi = 10.1108/00220410310698239 | title = RoMEO studies 1: The impact of copyright ownership on academic author self-archiving | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 243 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or appear to do so due to ambiguous language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Coleman | first1 = A. | title = Self-archiving and the Copyright Transfer Agreements of ISI-ranked library and information science journals | doi = 10.1002/asi.20494 | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 286 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3767615587113113566&amp;q=Storix&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,29 Johnson v. Storix] upheld a copyright transfer involving no written assignment. In that case, the Author, Anthony Johnson sold software as a sole proprietor and incorporated his company in 2003 as Storix, Inc. Eight years later he gave 60% share of the corporation to his employees, who later removed him from the company and claimed ownership of the copyrights. The court upheld a  jury decision that Johnson had made an oral agreement to transfer the copyright to the corporation upon its formation based on an annual report he wrote and signed a year later stating that he had transferred “all assets” from his sole proprietorship. The jury rejected Johnson's claim he intended only to transfer the license to sell the software, and further decided that Johnson became a work for hire upon forming the corporation, thereby also forfeiting all rights to his derivative works. This is the first case in which a document, not itself a contract or agreement and containing no reference to the copyrights, was considered a “note or memorandum” of copyright transfer, and the first time a sole owner of a company was designated a work for hire for copyright ownership purposes. This serves as a lesson that a “writing” required by the Copyright Act need not necessarily be “clear”, but may contain ambiguous language which can be interpreted by course of dealing by third parties to the alleged transaction.  

== Other models ==
Copyright transfer agreements are one way to govern permissions based on copyright. Since the advent of digital publishing, various commentators have pointed out the benefits of author-retained copyright,&lt;ref name=Bachrach1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilbanks2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilbanks | first1 = J. | authorlink = John Wilbanks| title = Another reason for opening access to research | doi = 10.1136/sbmj.39063.730660.F7 | journal = BMJ | volume = 333 | issue = 7582 | pages = 1306–1308 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17185718 | pmc =1761190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishers have started to implement it&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Watt | first1 = F. M. | last2 = Sever | first2 = R. | title = Non-profit publishing: Open access and the end of copyright transfer | doi = 10.1242/jcs.00873 | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 117 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 1 | year = 2004 | pmid =  14657267| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; using license agreements, wherein the author of the work retains copyright and gives the publisher the permission (exclusive or not) to reproduce and distribute the work. A third model is the so-called "browse-wrap" or "click-wrap" license model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burk|first=Dan L.|title=Intellectual Property in the Context of e-Science |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2007|volume=12|issue=2|url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol12/issue2/burk.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is becoming more and more popular in the form of the [[Creative Commons]] licenses: it allows anyone (including the publisher) to reproduce and distribute the work, with some possible restrictions. Creative Commons licenses are used by many [[open access journal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molloy | first1 = J. C. | title = The Open Knowledge Foundation: Open Data Means Better Science | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = e1001195 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22162946 | pmc = 3232214 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Author addenda ==
Copyright transfer agreements are usually prepared by the publisher, and some print journals include a copy of the statement in every issue they published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00348410 | title = Forthcoming papers | journal = Applied Physics A: Solids and Surfaces | volume = 59 | pages = A5–A5 | year = 1994 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If authors wish to deviate from the default phrasing&amp;nbsp;– ''e.g.'', if they want to retain copyright or would not like to grant the publisher an exclusive right to publish&amp;nbsp;– they can specify desired modifications, either by editing the document directly or by attaching an [[addendum#In contracts|addendum]] to a copy of the default version. Publisher policies on the acceptance of such addenda vary, though. Some institutions offer instructions and assistance for staff in creating such addenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Author rights: using the SPARC Author Addendum to secure your rights as the author of a journal article|url=http://www.sparc.arl.org/resources/authors/addendum|work=SPARC|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amend a Publishing Agreement|url=https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/authors/amend|work=Harvard University Library|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islamic Culture}}
'''Eid al-Adha''' ({{lang-ar|عيد الأضحى|ʿīd al-ʾaḍḥā|lit=Feast of the Sacrifice}}, {{IPA-ar|ʕiːd ælˈʔɑdˤħæː|}}), also called the "'''Festival of Sacrifice'''", is the second of two [[Islamic holidays]] celebrated worldwide each year (the other being [[Eid al-Fitr]]), and considered the holier of the two. It honors the willingness of [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim (Abraham)]] to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to [[God in Islam|God’s]] command.  But, before Abraham could sacrifice his son, God provided a lamb to sacrifice instead. In commemoration of this, an animal is sacrificed and divided into three parts: one part of the share is given to the poor and needy; second part is for the home, third is given to relatives.

In the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic lunar calendar]], ''Eid al-Adha'' falls on the 10th day of [[Dhu al-Hijjah]]. In the international [[Gregorian calendar|(Gregorian) calendar]], the dates vary from year to year drifting approximately 11 days earlier each year.

==Other names==
In languages other than Arabic, the name is often simply translated into the local language, such as English ''Feast of the Sacrifice'', German ''Opferfest'', Dutch ''Offerfeest'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''Sărbătoarea Sacrificiului'', and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''Áldozati ünnep''. In Spanish it is known as ''Fiesta del Cordero''&lt;ref name="Webislam"&gt;{{es}}''[http://www.webislam.com/articulos/37582-la_fiesta_del_cordero_en_marruecos.html La Fiesta del Cordero en Marruecos]'', Ferdaous Emorotene, 25 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Fiesta del Borrego'' (both meaning "festival of the lamb").

The following names are used as other names of Eid al-Adha:
*Īd al-Azhā / Īdul-Azhā / Iduladha (transliterations of the Arabic name) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pbctimes.com/prayertimes/eid-al-adha/|title=Eid Al Adha (Sacrifice Feast of Muslims) - Prayer Times NYC|date=8 August 2017|work=Prayer Times NYC|access-date=7 August 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used in Urdu, Hindi, Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, and Austronesian languages such as Malay and Indonesian.

Local language translations are used in Pashto (لوی اختر Loy Axtar), Kashmiri (Baed Eid), Urdu and Hindi (Baṛī Īd), Bengali (বড় ঈদ Boro Id), Tamil (Peru Nāl, "Great Day") and Malayalam (Bali Perunnal, "Great Day of Sacrifice") as well as Manding varieties in West Africa such as Bambara, Maninka, Jula etc. ([http://www.mali-pense.net/Bambara%20Lexique%20Pro/lexicon/s.htm#se%CC%81liba ߛߊߟߌߓߊ Seliba], "Big/great prayer").
*ʿĪd al-Baqarah meaning "Eid of Cows (also sheep or goats)" is used in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. Although the word ''baqarah'' (بقرة) properly means a cow, it is also semantically extended to mean all livestock, especially sheep or goats. This extension is used in Hindi and Urdu as a very similar name "Bakra-Eid / Bakrid" meaning "Goat Eid" is used for the occasion.

===Etymology===
The word عيد ʻīd means "festival," "celebration," "feast day," or "holiday." It comes from the triliteral root عين ʻayn واو wāw دال dāl, with associated root meanings of "to go back, to rescind, to accrue, to be accustomed, habits, to repeat, to be experienced; appointed time or place, anniversary, feast day."&lt;ref name="Oxford Arabic Dictionary"&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Arabic Dictionary |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-958033-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brill"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Badawi |first1=Elsaid M. |last2=Abdel Haleem |first2=Muhammad |title=Arabic-English Dictionary of Qur'anic Usage |date=2008 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=978-90-04-14948-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Jeffery]] contests this etymology, and believes the term to have been borrowed into Arabic from Syriac, or less likely Targumic Aramaic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jeffery |first1=Arthur |title=The Foreign Vocabulary of the Qur'ān |date=2007 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=978-90-04-15352-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ًأضحى 'aḍḥan means "sacrificial animal." It comes from the triliteral root ضاد ḍād حاء ḥā' واو wāw, with associated meanings "daylight… to appear, to appear conspicuously… sacrificial animal, to sacrifice."&lt;ref name="Brill"/&gt; No occurrence of this root with a meaning related to sacrifice occurs in the Qur'ān. In modern Arabic, the verb ضحّى ḍaḥḥā means "to sacrifice," and a ضحيّة ḍaḥiyyah is a sacrificial offering.&lt;ref name="Oxford Arabic Dictionary"/&gt;

The first element in the Persian name عيدِ قربان Id-e Qorbān is identical to Arabic ʻīd, above. The second is from Arabic قربان qurbān, meaning "offering, sacrifice." Christians use the term to mean eucharistic host. In the Islamic Arabic tradition, it is held to derive from the root قاف qāf راء rā' باء bā', with associated meanings of "closeness, proximity… to moderate; kinship…; to hurry; …to seek, to seek water sources…; scabbard, sheath; small boat; sacrifice."&lt;ref name="Brill"/&gt; [[Arthur Jeffery]] recognizes the same Semitic root, but believes the sense of the term to have entered Arabic through [[Aramaic]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Turkish Kurban Bayramı uses the same first element as the Persian قربان qorbān. Bayram means "holiday" in Turkish, with close cognates in other Turkish languages. Its ultimate etymology is contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aksan |first1=Yeşim |last2=Aksan |first2=Mustafa |last3=Mersinli |first3=Ümit |last4=Demirhan |first4=Umut Ufuk |title=A Frequency Dictionary of Turkish |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-1-138-83965-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Öztopçu |first1=Kurtuluş |last2=Abuov |first2=Zhoumagaly |last3=Kambarov |first3=Nasir |last4=Azemoun |first4=Youssef |title=Dictionary of the Turkic Languages |date=1996 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-14198-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Timurid Anthology Zhertva.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Abraham, about to sacrifice his son]] 
One of the main trials of Abraham’s life was to face the command of God to sacrifice his dearest possession, his son.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staff |first1=Writer |title=Abraham |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abraham#ref128767 |website=britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The son is named in the Quran[4:163], [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]], whereas it is mentioned as [[Isaac]] in the [[Bible]]. Upon hearing this command, Abraham prepared to submit to [[will of God]].&lt;ref name="Bate"/&gt; During this preparation, [[Devil (Islam)|Shaitan (the Devil)]] tempted Abraham and his family by trying to dissuade them from carrying out God's commandment, and Abraham drove Satan away by throwing pebbles at him. In commemoration of their rejection of Satan, stones are thrown at symbolic pillars during the [[Stoning of the Devil]] during Hajj rites.&lt;ref name="SUNY"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Firestone |first1=Reuven |title=Journeys in Holy Lands: The Evolution of the -Ishmael Legends in Islamic Exegesis |date=1990 |publisher=SUNY Press |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O69zjVnjL10C&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=Ishmael+sacrifice&amp;hl=fa&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq2-qI3LncAhWMUlAKHTCkCvIQ6AEIRDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Ishmael%20sacrifice&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham had shown that his love for God superseded all others: that he would lay down his own life or the lives of those dearest to him in [[ibadah|submission to God]]'s command. Muslims commemorate this ultimate act of sacrifice every year during Eid al-Adha. While Abraham was prepared to make an ultimate sacrifice, God ultimately prevents the sacrifice, additionally signifying that one should never sacrifice a human life, especially not in the name of God. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The word "Eid" appears once in [[Al-Ma'ida]], the fifth sura of the Quran, with the meaning "solemn festival".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|114|s=ns|q=Said [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] the son of [[Mary in Islam|Mary]]: "O Allah our Lord!

[[File:The Badshahi in all its glory during the Eid Prayers.JPG|thumb|Eid prayer at the [[Badshahi Mosque]] ]]
Devotees offer the Eid al-Adha prayers at the mosque. The Eid al-Adha prayer is performed any time after the sun completely rises up to just before the entering of ''[[Zuhr prayer|Zuhr]]'' time, on the 10th of Dhu al-Hijjah. In the event of a ''[[force majeure]]'' (e.g. natural disaster), the prayer may be delayed to the 11th of Dhu al-Hijjah and then to the 12th of Dhu al-Hijjah.&lt;ref name="H. X.

At the conclusion of the prayers and sermon, Muslims embrace and exchange greetings with one another (''[[Eid Mubarak]]''), give gifts and visit one another.

Men, women, and children are expected to dress in their finest clothing to perform Eid prayer in a large congregation in an open ''[[waqf]]'' ("stopping") field called Eidgah or mosque. Affluent Muslims who can afford it sacrifice their best [[halal]] domestic animals (usually a cow, but can also be a camel, goat, sheep, or ram depending on the region) as a symbol of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his only son.&lt;ref name="Ekrem"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Buğra Ekinci |first1=Ekrem |title=Qurban Bayram: How do Muslims celebrate a holy feast? |url=https://www.dailysabah.com/feature/2015/09/24/qurban-bayram-how-do-muslims-celebrate-a-holy-feast |website=dailysabah |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrificed animals, called {{transl|ar|Wehr|aḍḥiya}} ({{lang-ar|أضحية}}), known also by the Perso-Arabic term ''qurbāni'', have to meet certain age and quality standards or else the animal is considered an unacceptable sacrifice.&lt;ref name="CABI"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cussen |first1=V. |last2=Garces |first2=L. |title=Long Distance Transport and Welfare of Farm Animals |date=2008 |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-1845934033 |page=35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HixNfhRQAscC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=sacrificed+animals+meet+certain+age+and+quality+standards&amp;hl=fa&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRqPyXmMHcAhXSUlAKHSHJAVYQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sacrificed%20animals%20meet%20certain%20age%20and%20quality%20standards&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pakistan alone nearly ten million animals are slaughtered on Eid days costing over US$2.0 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiancorrespondent.com/42661/the-cost-of-sacrifice/ |title=Bakra Eid: The cost of sacrifice |publisher=Asian Correspondent |date=16 November 2010 |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meat from the sacrificed animal is preferred to be divided into three parts. The family retains one-third of the share; another third is given to relatives, friends, and neighbors; and the remaining third is given to the poor and needy.&lt;ref name="Ekrem"/&gt;

Muslims wear their new or best clothes. Women cook special sweets, including [[ma'amoul]] (filled shortbread cookies). They gather with family and friends.&lt;ref name="H. X. Lee"/&gt;

==Eid al-Adha in the Gregorian calendar==
{{See also|Islamic calendar}}
While Eid al-Adha is always on the same day of the Islamic calendar, the date on the Gregorian calendar varies from year to year since the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar and the Gregorian calendar is a [[solar calendar]]. The lunar calendar is approximately eleven days shorter than the solar calendar.&lt;ref name="Chris"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hewer |first1=Chris |title=Understanding Islam: The First Ten Steps |publisher=SCM Press |isbn=978-0334040323 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cu9eo1MFiYgC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=The+lunar+calendar+is+approximately+eleven+days+shorter+than+the+solar+calendar.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WBY1gnoHhz&amp;sig=8vwoXdYYAYDIXei6NNd8r2Z7J3k&amp;hl=fa&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi7lZi2x8HcAhUFJBoKHdDXDxgQ6AEwBnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=he%20Gregorian%20calendar&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, Eid al-Adha (like other Islamic holidays) falls on one of about two to four different Gregorian dates in different parts of the world, because the boundary of crescent visibility is different from the [[International Date Line]].

The following list shows the official dates of Eid al-Adha for Saudi Arabia as announced by the [[Supreme Judicial Council of Saudi Arabia|Supreme Judicial Council]]. Future dates are estimated according to the Umm al-Qura calendar of Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="ummalqura" /&gt; The Umm al-Qura is just a guide for planning purposes and not the absolute determinant or fixer of dates. Confirmations of actual dates by moon sighting are applied on the 29th day of the lunar month prior to Dhu al-Hijjah&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/eid-al-adha-2016-holiday-day-160814084340209.html|title=Eid al-Adha 2016 date is expected to be on September 11|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to announce the specific dates for both Hajj rituals and the subsequent Eid festival. The three days after the listed date are also part of the festival. The time before the listed date the pilgrims visit the Mount Arafat and descend from it after sunrise of the listed day.

In many countries, the start of any [[Islamic calendar|lunar Hijri]] month varies based on the observation of new moon by local religious authorities, so the exact day of celebration varies by locality.

'''Fangfeng''' ({{CJKV|t=防風|s=防风|p=Fángfēng}}) is a character from [[Chinese mythology]] as well as having been worshiped as a deity in Chinese popular religion. &lt;ref&gt;Yang, 111-113&lt;/ref&gt; As a mythological figure, Fangfeng is mostly known for arriving late for an assembly called by [[Yu the Great]] after the end of the [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]], and then being executed at the orders of Yu. Because Fangfeng was a giant (of nearly 10 meters/33 feet&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 112&lt;/ref&gt;), the executioner had to build a big dike in order to reach his head. Modern myths and legends regarding Fangfeng in China tend to emphasize that Fangfeng was wrongly executed: that the reason Fangfeng was late for the assembly was that on his way there he encountered a local flood and his delay was caused by his efforts to end the flood and save the people. As a god, worship of Fangfeng was most prominent in the [[Six Dynasties]] regions of [[Wu (region)|Wu]] and [[Yue (state)|Yue]] (modern [[Zhejiang]], [[Jiangsu]], and [[Shanghai]]). A common depiction of Fangfeng was as one-eyed and browed, [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]-headed, and [[Ox in Chinese mythology|ox]]-eared.

[[File:CVP521 3r.jpg|thumb|Beginning of Book 1 in the Vienna manuscript (''[[Codex Vindobonensis]]'' 521, fol. 3r).]]
[[File:CVP521 69v.jpg|thumb|First page of the ''descriptio insularum aquilonis'' in the Vienna manuscript (Codex Vindobonensis 521, fol. 69v).]]
'''''Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum''''' ([[Medieval Latin]] for ''"Deeds of the Bishops of Hamburg"'') is a historical treatise written between 1073 and 1076 by [[Adam of Bremen]], who made additions (''scholia'') to the text until his death (possibly 1081; before 1085).
It is one of the most important sources of the medieval history of [[Northern Europe]], and the oldest textual source reporting the [[Norse colonization of the Americas|discovery of coastal North America]].

It covers the entire period known as the [[Viking Age]], from the foundation of the bishopric under [[Willehad]] in 788 until the rule of prince-bishop [[Adalbert of Bremen|Adalbert]] in Adam's own time (1043–1072).
The text focuses  on the history of the  [[Hamburg-Bremen]] diocese and its [[List of administrators, archbishops, bishops, and prince-archbishops of Bremen|bishops]]. As the bishops had jurisdiction over the  [[Christianization of Scandinavia|missions to Scandinavia]], it also gives a report of the [[Norse paganism]] of the period.

The existence of the work was forgotten in the later medieval period, until it was re-discovered in the late 16th century in the library of [[Sorø Abbey]], Denmark.

==Contents==
The treatise consist of the following parts:
*an introduction, addressed to bishop [[Liemar]]
*Book 1: History of the bishopric of Bremen and (after 845) [[Hamburg-Bremen]] (788–940)
*Book 2: History of the archbishopric Hamburg-Bremen (940–1045)
*Book 3: Biography of archbishop [[Adalbert of Hamburg]] (r. 1043–1072)
*Book 4: ''Descriptio insularum aquilonis'': Geographical description of Northern Europe
*''M. Adami epilogus ad Liemarum episcopum'': A dedication to bishop Liemar in hexameters

The text is one of the most important sources of  Northern German and Scandinavian history and geography in the [[Viking Age]] and the beginning [[High Middle Ages]]. It covers the relations between [[Saxons]], [[Wends]] (West Slavs) and [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] (Vikings).  The third book is focused on the biography of archbishop [[Adalbert of Hamburg]].
Adam based his works in part on [[Einhard]], [[Cassiodorus]], and other earlier historians, consulting the library of the church of Bremen. The text as presented to bishop Liemar was completed in 1075/1076.&lt;ref name=remy/&gt;

After the death of Bishop Leuderich (838–45), the see was given to [[Ansgar]], it lost its independence, and from that time on was permanently united with the Archdiocese of Hamburg.
The [[Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen]] was  designated the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|"Mission of the North"]] and had jurisdiction over all missions in [[Scandinavia]], and the entire scope of [[Viking expansion]] in the north ([[Volga trade route|Russia]], [[Settlement of Iceland|Iceland]], [[History of Greenland#Norse settlement|Greenland]]), throughout the [[Viking Age]], until the archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen had a falling-out with [[Pope Paschal II|the pope]], and separate archbishopric for the North was established in [[Lund]] in 1105.

Adam is also an important source of Viking Age [[Norse paganism]], including the practice of [[human sacrifice]]:&lt;ref&gt;
"There is a festival at Uppsala every nine years [...] The sacrifice is as follows; of every kind of male creature, nine victims are offered. By the blood of these creatures it is the custom to appease the gods. Their bodies, moreover, are hanged in a grove which is adjacent to the temple. This grove is so sacred to the people that the separate trees in it are believed to be holy because of the death or putrefaction of the sacrificial victims. There even dogs and horses hang beside human beings."{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The description of the [[temple at Uppsala]] is one of the most famous excerpts of the ''Gesta'':
:"In this temple, entirely decked out in gold, the people worship the statues of three gods in such wise that the mightiest of them, [[Thor]], occupies a throne in the middle of the chamber; [[Wotan]] and [[Frikko]] have places on either side. (…) Thor, they say, presides over the air, which governs the thunder and lightning, the winds and rains, fair weather [and] crops. The other, Wotan – that is, ''[[Odin#Name|Fury]]'' [''Wodan, id est furor''] – carries on war and imparts to man strength against his enemies. The third is Frikko, who bestows peace and pleasure on mortals. His likeness, too, they fashion with an immense phallus."&lt;ref name="Tschan 1595"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tschan|first=Francis J.|title=History of the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen [by] Adam of Bremen. Translated with an introd. and notes by Francis J. Tschan|year=1959|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth book describes the geography of [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Baltic states|Baltic region]].
It mentions numerous episcopal seats and churches, including  [[Meldorf]], [[Schenefeld (Kreis Steinburg)|Schenefeld]], [[Verden (Aller)|Verden]] ({{ill|Roman Catholic diocese of Verden|lt=Diocese of Verden|de|Bistum Verden}}), [[Pahlen]], [[Ratzeburg]], [[Mecklenburg]], [[Oldenburg in Holstein]] and [[Jumne]].
Beyond this, it gives a  description of the coast of Scandinavia and of the "northern isles" including [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]] and notably (in chapter 39) [[Vinland]] (North America),&lt;ref group=note&gt;Adam mentions Vinland (''Winland'') in Chapter 39 of Book IV of his ''Gesta'': {{cite book |last1=Adam von Bremen |editor1-last=Schmeidler |editor1-first=Bernhard |title=Hamburgische Kirchengeschichte |trans-title=Hamburg's Church History |date=1917 |publisher=Hahnsche |location=Hannover and Leipzig, Germany |pages=275–276 |url=https://archive.org/stream/adamvonbremenham00adam#page/274/mode/2up |language=Latin and German}}  From pp. 275–276:  ''"XXXVIIII. Praeterea unam adhuc insulam recitavit a multis in eo repertam oceano, quae dicitur Winland, eo quid ibi vites sponte nascantur, vinum optimum ferentes.  Nam et fruges ibi non seminatas habundare, non fabulosa opinione, sed certa comperimus relatione Danorum.  Post quam insulam, ait, terra non invenitur habitabilis in illo oceano, sed omnia, quae ultra sunt, glacie intolerabili ac caligine immensa plena sunt.  Cujus rei Martianus ita meminit:  Ultra Thilen, inquiens, navigatione unius diei mare concretum est. Temptavit hoc nuper experientissimus Nordmannorum princeps Haraldus.  Qui latitudinem septentrionalis oceani perscrutatus navibus tandem caligantibus ante ora deficientis mundi finibus, inmane baratrum abyssi retroactis vestigiis vix salvus evasit."''  (39.  In addition, he [i.e., [[Sweyn II of Denmark|Sweyn Estridsson]], king of Denmark (reigned 1047–1076)] named one more island in this ocean, discovered by many, which is called "Vinland", because vines grow wild there, making the best wine.  For [that] crops [that are] not sown, abound there, we learn not from fanciful opinion but from the true account of the Danes.  Beyond which island, it is said, habitable land is not found in that ocean, but all [places] that are beyond, are filled with intolerable ice and boundless fog.  About this subject Martianus [i.e., [[Martianus Capella]] (fl. ca. 410–420) in his ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'' (On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury), Book VI, § 666] recalled:  At one day's sailing beyond [[Thule]], he says, the sea is frozen.  Harald [i.e., [[Harald Hardrada]] (ca. 1015–1066), King of Norway], the most enterprising leader of the Normans, recently attempted [to go] to this place. [It was he] who – the extent of the northern ocean having been investigated by [his] ships –  finally by withdrawing from the fogs before the edge at the world's end, barely escaped safely the vast abyss of Hell by reversing [his] tracks.)&lt;/ref&gt; being the oldest extant written record of the Norse discovery of North America. Adam of Bremen had been at the court of Danish king  [[Sweyn II of Denmark|Sven Estridson]] and was informed about the Viking discoveries in the North Atlantic there.

==Author==
Adam is believed to have come from [[Meissen]] ([[Latin]] ''Misnia'') in [[Saxony]].&lt;ref name=gilman&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilman, ed.|first=Daniels|title=The New International Encyclopedia|year=1905|publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Co.|location=New York|pages=101|url=https://archive.org/stream/newinternational01gilm#page/101/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was probably born before 1050 and died on 12 October of an unknown year (possibly 1081, at the latest 1085).
From his chronicles it is apparent that he was familiar with a number of authors. The honorary name of ''Magister Adam'' shows that he had passed through all the stages of a higher education. It is probable that he was taught at the ''[[Magdeburg]]er Domschule''.

In 1066 or 1067 he was invited by archbishop [[Adalbert of Hamburg]] to join the [[Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen]].&lt;ref name=remy&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01132c.htm Remy, Arthur F.J. "Adam of Bremen." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 20 Sept. 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Adam was accepted among the capitulars of Bremen, and by 1069 he appeared as director of the cathedral's school.&lt;ref name=remy/&gt; Soon thereafter he began to write the history of Hamburg-Bremen and of the northern lands in his ''Gesta''.
His position and the missionary activity of the church of Hamburg-Bremen allowed him to gather information on the history and the geography of [[Northern Germany]]. A stay at the court of [[Svend Estridson]] gave him the opportunity to find information about the history and geography of Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries.&lt;ref name=remy/&gt;

==Manuscript tradition==
According to Schmeidler (1917), Adam created three versions of the text, in the convention of Schmeidler (1917) labelled
*(A) representing his preliminary text,
*(a) the work as given to bishop Liemar, and
*(X) which he kept for his own use and supplemented with various additions (''scholia'').
None of the three archetypes has been preserved. The most relevant surviving manuscripts are classified into three groups, labelled A, B and C.

The best manuscript is of group A, labelled A1 ([[Austrian National Library|National Library Vienna]], cod. 521), dated to the first half of the 13th century.
Parts of book 2, book 4 and some scholia are also preserved in a ms. dated ca. 1100 ([[Leiden University Library]], Codex Vossianus Latinus, VLQ 123).

Manuscripts in the B and C groups are derived from version X. They contain independent additions of scholia. The best ms. in group B was the so-called Codex z, written 1161/2, which was however lost in the [[Copenhagen Fire of 1728]]. Some copies of this ms. are extant.
The best ms. in group C, labelled C1, is at the [[Royal Library, Denmark|Copenhagen Royal Library]], Old Royal Collection, No. 2296 quarto (dated c. 1230).

&lt;!--
Rome, Vatican Library, 2010;
Vienna, Hofu. Staatsbibliothek, 413, of 13th cent.; -- is this the same as "cod. 521"?
Wolfenbuttel, Ducal Library, Gud. 83, of 15th cent.
--&gt;

==Editions==
The editio princeps was printed in 1595 after the now-lost ms. C2  by  Erpold Lindenberg.
&lt;!--EB1911: the first published at Copenhagen, 1579 (the first of the Libellus or Descriptio Ins. Aquil. appeared at Stockholm in 1615)
and --&gt;
It was reprinted as ''{{lang|la|Scriptores rerum septentrionalium}}'' in 1609 and 1630.
The fourth book was edited by Johannes Messinus in Stockholm in 1615, and by  [[Stephan Hansen Stephanius|Stephanus Johannes Stephanius]] in Leiden in 1629.
A revised edition by  Joachim Johannes Mader appeared in Helmstedt in 1670, reprinted 1706 by   [[Johann Albert Fabricius|J. A. Fabricius]] in Hamburg.

The first critical edition, based on ms. A1, is due to [[Johann Martin Lappenberg]], published 1846. It was included in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'' series, appearing in a revised edition by Georg Waitz in 1876, and edited by Migne in 1884 ([[Patrologia Latina|PL]] 146).
The edition by Bernhard Schmeidler (1917, reprinted 1977, 1993) remains current.

'''Lotus Organizer''' was a [[personal information manager]] (PIM). It was initially developed by Threadz, a small [[United Kingdom|British]] software house, reaching version 3.0. Organizer was subsequently acquired by [[Lotus Development Corporation]], for whom the package was a [[Windows]]-based replacement for [[Lotus Agenda]]. For several years it was the unquestioned market leader until it was gradually overtaken by [[Microsoft Outlook]].

Organizer is notable for using the ″leather-bound personal organizer″ graphical metaphor for its [[user interface]]. It is often bundled within [[Lotus SmartSuite]].

==Status==

On 14 May 2013 IBM announced the immediate "withdrawal and discontinuance of support" of Lotus SmartSuite, Lotus Organizer and Lotus 123.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&amp;infotype=an&amp;appname=iSource&amp;supplier=897&amp;letternum=ENUS913-091|title=Software withdrawal and discontinuance of support: Lotus SmartSuite, Lotus Organizer and Lotus 123|date=14 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 6.1 was the last version. It supported [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]] , [[Windows 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21411413|title=IBM Information about SmartSuite and Organizer working on Microsoft Windows 7 - United States|date=28 January 2010|publisher=|access-date=2012-05-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204170327/http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21411413|archive-date=2012-02-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Windows 10

==Versions==

===Microsoft Windows===
Organizer was a part of Lotus SmartSuite, but was also sold as a single application. The latest releases of SmartSuite did not include the current version of Organizer; it was sold separately only.

Versions up to 2 were 16-bit programs. Later versions are 32-bit programs.

===IBM OS/2===

The first OS/2 version was released in 1998. Until then, the Windows 16-bit version had been used. The last version is 1.7 from 2001. Later revisions of SmartSuite did not upgrade Organizer, although some fixes have been made.

Organizer for OS/2 uses the .or4 file format. This means that it cannot exchange data files with the later Windows versions, other than by importing and exporting data.

The features and user interface for Organizer for OS/2 are similar to that of Organizer 97 for Windows. It lacks later improvements, such as importing and exporting [[vCard]] and [[iCalendar]] files, and synchronisation with [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1676">'''''Independent Municipal &amp; Allied Trade Union v Rustenburg Transitional Council''''' is an important case in [[South African labour law]]. The council (the employer in this case) had adopted a resolution that its employees in senior managerial positions would not be permitted to serve in executive positions of trade unions; nor would they be permitted involvement in trade-union activities. The resolution was later amended to remove the prohibition on trade-union activities, but the prohibition on holding executive positions remained.

A union with members employed by the council, and some senior managers who were members of the union, approached the Labour Court for an order declaring the resolution to be in contravention of the Constitution.

The court granted the order, but did indicate that there were limitations to the scope of section 4 of the Labour Relations Act.

It pointed out that, in terms of common-law principles, an employee owed an employer a "duty of fidelity"—that is, a duty to act in good faith—and that, because of the conflicting aims of trade unions and employers, participation in trade-union activities could, in the case of senior managerial employees, breach this duty of fidelity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6990">'''International Classification for Standards''' ('''ICS''') is an international classification system for [[standardization|technical standards]]. It is designed to cover every economic sector and virtually every activity of the humankind where technical [[standardization|standards]] may be used.

Developed and maintained by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], the ICS is intended to be a continuous work in progress and is updated when necessary.  The latest edition of the ICS can be downloaded free of charge from the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] web site.

Anyone may submit a proposal for modifications or additions to the ICS.

== Purpose ==
The ICS serves as a structure for catalogues and [[database]]s of [[standardization|technical standards]] and other normative documents, and as a basis for standing-order systems for international, regional and national standards.

== Classification principles ==
The ICS uses an hierarchical classification, which consists of three nested levels called ''fields'' (Level 1), ''groups'' (Level 2) and ''sub-groups'' (Level 3). Each ''field'' is subdivided into ''groups'', which are further divided into ''sub-groups''.

All classification levels are designated by a classification code (called ''notation'') and a title. The notation is a set of [[Arabic numeral]]s.

Top-level items, which have no parent levels, use a two-digit notation, for example:
:&lt;code&gt;''43 ROAD VEHICLE ENGINEERING''&lt;/code&gt;

The notations for ''groups'' and ''sub-groups'' include the parent-level notations. The example below shows a notation for Sub-Group 20 (Level 3), which belongs to Group 040 (Level 2) in Field 43 (Level 1). 
:&lt;code&gt;''43.040.20 Lighting, signaling and warning devices''&lt;/code&gt;

=== Level 1 (Fields) ===

A ''field'' is the first level in the International Classification for Standards. It may represent one or a combination of the following:
*'''A sector''' of the economy such as [[agriculture]], [[mining]], [[construction]] or the [[packaging]] industry;
*'''A technology''' such as [[telecommunications]] or [[food technology|food processing]];
*'''An activity''' such as [[environment protection]], [[safety]] assurance and protection of [[public health]];
*'''A field of science''' such as [[mathematics]] or [[astronomy]].

At present the classification includes 40 ''fields''.

:01  Generalities. Terminology. Standardization. Documentation

:03  Services. Company Organization, Management And Quality. Administration. Transport. Sociology

:07  Mathematics. Natural Sciences

:11  Health Care Technology

:97  Domestic And Commercial Equipment. Entertainment. Sports

===Level 2 (Groups) ===

The ICS second level, the ''group'', is a subdivision of the ''field''.

=== Level 3 (Sub-Groups) ===

''Sub-groups'' are used in the ICS to subdivide ''groups'' into subjects that certain to a particular aspect of the subject covered by a given ''group''. Regardless of the subject, virtually all ''groups'' include a ''sub-group'' No. 01 that covers the complete subject of the respective ''group''. In addition, most of the ''groups'' contain a ''sub-group'' No. 99 for standards on subjects which do not correspond either to the subjects of the general ''sub-groups'' or to the subjects of the specific ''sub-groups'' of the respective ''groups''.

=== Level 4 (Units) ===

Level 4 subdivisions are not part of the official ICS document. The ICS rules however allow users of the classification system to subdivide the official ICS ''sub-groups'' into so-called ''units'', making them a Level 4 component of the International Classification for Standards. This is accomplished by adding a two-digit number to the notation of the ''sub-group'' being subdivided. However, instead of a period, new notations use a [[hyphen]] as a separator. For example:
:&lt;code&gt;''35.220.20-10 Magnetic  tapes''&lt;/code&gt;

== Statistics ==
*The International Classification for Standards has 99 top-level divisions of which only 40 are presently used. The remaining 59 divisions are reserved for topics that are not yet known.
*There are three "official" levels in the ICS system, each holding ninety nine (99), nine hundred and ninety nine (999) and ninety nine (99) subsets, respectively.
*Each ''field'' of the ICS is designed to hold a maximum of 999 ''groups''.
*Although any ''group'' in the ICS may contain no more than 99 "official" ''sub-groups'', the holding capacity of the ''group'' can be expanded 99 times by using "unofficial" Level 4 subdivisions, an option that is built into the ICS. Adding Level 4 subdivisions to all ''sub-groups'' within a ''group'' increases the ''group's'' holding capacity to 9 801 subjects.
*The expanded version of the International Classification for Standards is capable of covering nearly 1 billion subjects (969,328,701 to be exact). This can be achieved without any restructuring of its numerical coding system. Since there are currently about 780 000 national standards in the world, the number of subjects that the ICS can offer for classification purposes exceeds 1 200 times the total number of documents that are available for classification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4692">The '''International Standard Bibliographic Description''' ('''ISBD''') is a set of rules produced by the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) to create a bibliographic description in a standard, human-readable form, especially for use in a bibliography or a [[library catalog]]. A preliminary consolidated edition of the ISBD was published in 2007 and the consolidated edition was published in 2011, superseding earlier separate ISBDs for [[monograph]]s, older monographic publications, cartographic materials, serials and other continuing resources, electronic resources, non-book materials, and printed music. IFLA's ISBD Review Group is responsible for maintaining the ISBD.

One of the original purposes of the ISBD was to provide a standard form of bibliographic description that could be used to exchange records internationally.  This would support IFLA's [[Universal Bibliographic Control]] program.

== Structure of an ISBD record ==

The ISBD defines nine areas of description. Each area, except area 7, is composed of multiple elements with structured classifications. Elements and areas that do not apply to a particular resource are omitted from the description. Standardized punctuation (colons, semicolons, slashes, dashes, commas, and periods) is used to identify and separate the elements and areas. The order of elements and standardized punctuation make it easier to interpret bibliographic records when one does not understand the language of the description.

* 0: Content form and media type area
* 1: Title and statement of responsibility area, consisting of
** 1.1 Title proper
** 1.2 Parallel title
** 1.3 Other title information
** 1.4 Statement of responsibility
* 2: Edition area
* 3: Material or type of resource specific area (e.g., the scale of a [[map]] or the numbering of a periodical)
* 4: Publication, production, distribution, etc., area
* 5: Material description area (e.g., number of pages in a book or number of CDs issued as a unit)
* 6: Series area
* 7: Notes area
* 8: Resource identifier and terms of availability area (e.g., [[ISBN]], [[ISSN]])

== Example ==

A typical ISBD record looks like this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Text : unmediated&lt;br /&gt;
A manual for writers of research papers, theses, and dissertations : Chicago style for students and researchers / Kate L. Turabian ; revised by Wayne C. Booth, Gregory G. Colomb, Joseph M. Williams, and University of Chicago Press editorial staff. &amp;mdash; 7th ed. &amp;mdash; Chicago : University of Chicago Press, 2007. &amp;mdash; xviii, 466 p. : ill. ; 23 cm. &amp;mdash; (Chicago guides to writing, editing, and publishing). &amp;mdash; Includes bibliographical references (p. 409-435) and index. &amp;mdash; {{ISBN|978-0-226-82336-2}} (cloth : alk. paper) : USD35.00. &amp;mdash; {{ISBN|978-0-226-82337-9}} (pbk. : alk. paper) : USD17.00
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1039">The '''Jazz Institute of Chicago''' is a non-profit arts presenting organization that produces [[jazz]] concerts and runs educational programs. It was founded in 1969 by a small band of jazz fans, writers, club owners, and musicians to preserve the historical roots of [[Chicago]] music and to ensure that the music would still be heard.

Among the founding members were trad pianist [[Art Hodes]], [[Muhal Richard Abrams]], who a few years earlier had also co-founded the [[Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians]] (AACM), Harriett Choice, then music writer for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Joe Segal, owner of [[The Jazz Showcase]], [[Bob Koester]], owner of [[Delmark Records]], Don DeMicheal, drummer and editor of ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine, and jazz promoter and supporter Penny Tyler.

'''King &amp; McGaw''' is an art publisher and online retailer. It supplies high quality art prints and products to museums, galleries and retail stores as well as art prints direct to consumers through its online retail site. Production is based in their {{convert|50000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}} factory in [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]], Sussex.

The company was set up in Sussex in 1982 by three brothers Gyr, Quentin and Perry King under the name King Publishing, as a silkscreen printing company. The company designed upmarket posters for art galleries and small boutique shops.  The brothers negotiated the rights to works of art by new artists and photographers, as well as established artists such as [[Bridget Riley]], [[Howard Hodgkin]] and [[Terry Frost]].&lt;ref name="mynewsdesk.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/pressreleases/james-bidwell-appointed-ceo-of-easyart-as-fast-growing-online-art-company-secures-additional-funding-round-930212|title=James Bidwell appointed CEO of Easyart as fast growing online art... – Easyart UK|work=Mynewsdesk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kingandmcgaw-newhaven-factory.jpg|left|thumb|King &amp; McGaw Warehouse in Newhaven]]
The company rebranded to King Posters by the late 1980s with the business developing into other areas including framing and product development for museum shops such as the [[Tate]], [[National Gallery]], [[Louvre]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="mynewsdesk.com" /&gt;

In 1989 King Posters was making annual sales of £2&amp;nbsp;million but later that year a fire destroyed the warehouse and resulted in £3&amp;nbsp;million worth of stock being lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/article1037306.ece|title=How I Made It: Gyr King, founder of King &amp; McGaw – The Sunday Times|work=[[The Sunday Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's bank loaned an additional £5000 so the stock could be reprinted and an American supplier, Bruce McGaw, offered to replace some of the missing stock for free, which, in turn, triggered a business deal. As a result, the company was renamed in 1990 to King &amp; McGaw.

During the 1990s, King &amp; McGaw's focused on turning to supplying department stores with pictures and posters as well as museums and galleries resulting in partnerships with [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]], [[Next plc|Next]] and [[Debenhams]]. As a result, sales had reached $35&amp;nbsp;million a year by the end of 2000. Further developments occurred in 2007 when the company switched to digital printing, allowing them to print-to-order.
[[File:Kingandmcgaw-popup-shop-london-may2015.jpg|right|thumb|Pop Up Shop in Soho, London]]
By 2011 the company decided to expand into retail by acquiring the online retailer Easyart.com. Easyart was set up by Simon Matthews in 1999 during the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]] and in 2002 faced legal allegations from [[Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou]], the founder of [[EasyJet]], over its use of the easy name, accusing Easyart of "passing off" on easyGroup's good name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/11/12/easyart_com_to_face_stelios/|title=Easyart.com to face Stelios in 'easy' court action|work=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easyart won the court battle when easyGroup discontinued its legal action, saying it had bigger targets to go after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-3545|title=EasyGroup abandons domain claim against Easyart.com|author=Luisa Deas|publisher=[[Out-Law.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, the company, then under CEO and co-founder Marc Lickfett, discontinued the Easyart brand and merged the site within the King &amp; McGaw brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fineart.co.uk/article/easyart-rebrands-as-king--mcgaw-966.aspx|title=Easyart rebrands as King &amp; McGaw|publisher=[[Fine Art Trade Guild]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 King &amp; McGaw used a [[pop-up retail|pop-up]] shop to showcase lithographic posters from the [[Mourlot Studios]] archives on [[D'Arblay Street]], [[Soho]], London.&lt;ref name="itsnicethat.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/atelier-mourlot|title=It's Nice That – Gorgeous rare posters by the likes of Picasso, Míro and Le Corbusier|work=It's Nice That}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributions from artists such as

Note: Within this list, ''[[Chinese encyclopedia]]'' translates ''[[leishu]]'', a traditional Chinese [[reference work]] that, unlike a modern encyclopedia with expressly written articles, consists of excerpts from primary texts arranged by categories. ''[[Serial (literature)|Fascicle]]'' translates ''juan'' [[wikt:卷|卷]] "scroll; fascicle; volume" for early (pre-20th century) encyclopedias and ''[[Volume (bibliography)|volume]]'' refers to modern encyclopedias.

The '''''Llibre dels fets''''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈʎiβɾə ðəls ˈfets}}), originally spelled '''''Libre dels feyts''''' (literally in English: "Book of Deeds"), is the  autobiographical chronicle of the reign of [[James I of Aragon]] (1213 – 1276).

James I inherited as a child the titles of [[King of Aragon]], [[Count of Barcelona]], and [[Lords of Montpellier|Lord of Montpellier]], but also became by conquest [[List of monarchs of Majorca|King of Majorca]] and [[List of Valencian monarchs|King of Valencia]]. James emphasises in his chronicles his [[conquest of Majorca]] (1229) and of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] (1238).

James I of Aragon dedicates a couple of chapters to his mother [[Maria of Montpellier]] and his father [[Peter II of Aragon]] (called "Peter the Catholic"), who had been given the title of "''[[Rex Catholicissimus]]''" by the Pope after the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] in which he helped [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] fight against the [[Moors]], one year before his death. Peter II of Aragon died defending his vassal lords of [[Occitania]], who were accused of allowing the [[Catharism|Cathar heresy]] to proliferate in their counties. He was killed in the [[Battle of Muret]], fighting against the [[Crusades|Crusader]] troops commanded by [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]].&lt;ref name="RosenbergSwitten2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Samuel N.

The conquest by James I in 1229 of [[Majorca]], one of the [[Balearic Islands]] held by the [[Almohad Caliphate|Muslim Almohads]], and his consequent founding of the [[Kingdom of Majorca]], probably inspired him to start the dictation of his chronicles, he having had an active part in the ''[[Reconquista]]'' of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (in the context of Europe's medieval Christian [[Crusades]]). The ''Llibre dels fets'' narrative ends with James' death in 1276. Though the original is lost, many ancient copies of the codex have survived.

The oldest extant manuscript written in the original [[Catalan language]], a copy dating to 1343, was commissioned by the abbot of the [[Poblet Monastery]]. An older manuscript dating to 1313, the "''Cronice Illustrissimi Regis Aragonum"'', was the version translated into [[Latin]] from the Catalan original "''Llibre dels Feyts del Rei en Jacme"''. The Latin translation is signed by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar [[Pere Marsili]], who was ordered by [[James II of Aragon]] (James I's grandson) to honour his grandfather's memory by promulgating his words in the internationally used Latin language.

== Particular features ==
As the title itself indicates, more than a bare chronicle, the ''Llibre dels fets'' is in fact a "Book of Deeds". Studies conducted in the 1980s concluded that this medieval manuscript is of an undefined literary style, since it was dictated entirely orally. James I of Aragon, a cultivated man, dictated the entire book to royal scribes, who at that point in history commonly performed the labour of actually writing the king's words with pen on paper. Its style is informal and colloquial.

Here is an extract of the first lines:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...  Raconta Mon Senyor San Jaume que la fe sense obres, morta es. Aquesta paraula va voler complr Senyor en els nostres fets...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(English: ...  says My Lord Saint James that faith without actions, is dead. This word he wanted to accomplish, Lord, in our deeds...)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The principal characteristics of James' style are:
* Religious Feeling
* The love of the King for his realms
* Direct participation in the events described
* Military and heroic spirit
* Popular and improvised language

== Structure ==
[[File:Historia del molt alt y invictissim senyor lo Rey Don Jayme de Aragon-1619-f1r.jpg|thumb|1619 Frontispiece of Catalan manuscript made by Jaume Ferrera]]
In the ''Llibre del Fets'', James I of Aragon describes his life and his most important actions, such as the conquest of the Muslim-held [[List of Valencian monarchs|Valencia]] and [[conquest of Majorca|Majorca]]. The narrative begins with his birth in 1203 and ends with his death in 1276. The prologue and epilogue are written in a different style, more erudite and perfectionist than the rest of the text, and presumably written after his death. James was generally very explicit in expressing himself, as shown in his recitation of his deeds:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''E per tal que los hòmens coneguessen, quan hauríem passada aquesta vida mortal, ço que nós hauríem fet [...] e per dar eximpli a tots los altres hòmes del món...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(English: So that men acknowledge, when we have passed this mortal life, this that we have accomplished [,,,] and to give example to all the other men of the world...)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Latin translation of 1313 by [[Pere Marsili]], the friar informs his readers that he has translated chapters from the manuscripts then kept in the royal archives, indicating that the texts of the chronicles already existed and that they were written in the vulgar language, i.e., not in Latin, but in [[Catalan language|Catalan]].

The oldest preserved copy of the manuscript in the Catalan language is the copy ordered in 1343, more than 60 years after James' death, by the Abbot of the [[Poblet Monastery]]. The text of the Catalan manuscript is nearly identical to that of the Latin translation, but the Catalan version cannot be a copy of the Latin version, as the Catalan one is written in the first person, mainly using the majestic plural "we", and only a few times the singular "I", while the Latin version is written in the third person, using the first person in only a few quotes. This fact makes it improbable that the Catalan manuscript comes from the Latin version.

The internal structure of both versions seems to indicate two moments in time: the first part may have been dictated around 1240, shortly after James' conquest of Valencia. The facts before 1228 are explained in a brief, imprecise way even with significant errors, while from then on, the narrative shows greater detail and precision.

The supposed second part might have been dictated around 1274, and has a similar structure; the facts from 1242-1265 are condensed in a few pages, while the later years are again explicated in great detail. The prologue and the section that describes his illness and death were probably written or dictated by someone in James' trust. The Catalan copy of 1343 and the Latin translation of 1313 have left posterity the same content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El Llibre dels feyts de Jaume I.

== General content ==
The content of the ''Llibre dels fets'', the chronicles of James I, can be divided into four parts:
# 1208–1228: Some chapters dedicated to his ancestors and parents, his mother ([[Maria of Montpellier]]) by whom he was Lord of Montpellier, and to his father ([[Peter II of Aragon|Peter II of Aragon "The Catholic"]]), by whom he was [[King of Aragon]], [[County of Barcelona|Count of Barcelona]] and Count of Urgell. James' quite unexpected birth. Chapters dedicated to his father's death, known as Peter "The Catholic" (title of "[[Rex Catholicissimus]]" given to him by the Pope, after the [[battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] against the [[Moors]]), and his death at the [[battle of Muret]], while defending his [[Vassal|vassal Lords]] of [[Occitania]] against the invading crusader troops, mostly [[Kingdom of France|Frankish]], commanded by [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester]] in the context of the [[Cathar Crusade]] (or [[Albigensian Crusade]], as it started at the southern city of [[Albi]], while casually the Regent Queen of the Franks at that time was [[Blanche of Castile]]). James' captivity at the age of 5 after his father's death, and how Simon de Montfort wanted to marry him to his daughter (failed plan that would have brought the De Montfort family into the [[Crown of Aragon]]). Finally James was returned to Aragon, where the [[Knights Templar|Templar Knights]], a powerful [[Military religious orders|military religious order]] within the medieval Crown of Aragon), guarded and raised him. James' childhood at [[Monzón Castle|Monzon Castle]], (the Templars' main castle).&lt;ref name="Smith2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Damian J. Smith|title=The Book of Deeds of James I of Aragon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvTyDyt-Ru4C&amp;pg=PA56|date=1 February 2010|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-0150-6|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also explains his further marriage to Eleanor of Castile.
# 1229–1240: The most detailed part of the "Llibre dels fets". The [[conquest of Majorca]] (1229). This would be the first step in the history of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. Shortly after that would come the [[Kingdom of Valencia|conquest of Valencia]] in 1238. The book tries to prove how King James accomplishments were Divine Will.
# 1240–1265: Describes the conflicts with the ''[[Saracen]]'' rebels from Valencia.
# 1265–1276:  Again a narrative describing the battles against the [[Moors]]. The conquest of Murcia. Also a lot of political episodes which claim to justify his actions. The last chapters, which explain the king's illness and death were written and included in the Chronicle presumably after James' death.

== Language and style ==
A didactic and justifying intention is largely reflected throughout the chronicle as a religious impulse, indicating that James I believed the execution of the work was guided by divine providence. The king, who normally desired to appear as an epic hero, not only recounts military and political history in the narrative, but also frequently mentions small details of his daily life, as well as some of his most intimate thoughts.

A "popular and vivid language" full of proverbs and colloquial expressions is used in the chronicles, which also quote foreign personages speaking other languages such as [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Galician-Portuguese]] (used by the Crown of Castile), [[Arabic]] or [[Old French]].

== Codices and editions ==
[[File:Cronice Illustrissimi Regis Aragonum-f6r.jpg|left|thumb|1313 Latin translation of the ''Llibre dels Fets'', the ''Cronice Illustrissimi Regis Aragonum'' by Friar [[Pere Marsili]] following the order of James II of Aragon (grandson of James I of Aragon).]]

Five codices of the text from the [[14th century in literature|14th century]] and two from the [[15th century in literature|15th]] are preserved, all based on a translation of the original Catalan text into [[Latin]] by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] [[Pere Marsili]] at the order of King James' grandson (his namesake James II of Aragon). He intended to adapt the original text to contemporary manners and style, as can be read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] So that the deeds of His glorious grandfather (James I), collected in a truthful but vulgar style, shall be put to date and once translated to Latin, form a single History volume, a full chronicle in which all the actions of the king his grandfather (James I the Conqueror) will be woven together.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Latin language was used in the correspondence between Friar Pere Marsili and James II of Aragon. Translation from the Catalan Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Friar Pere Marsili finished this royal assignment on 2 April 1313, and then petitioned the king that a copy of the manuscript be made for the [[Friars Preachers]] of [[Majorca]], his homeland, to be used on the day of the "Feast of the Banner":

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] with the purpose of the last day of the year, the annual feast which commemorates the conquest of the city of Majorca, for God's glory and the eternally worshiping memory of his Luckiest Prince (James I), and so the friars who preach on this significative solemn date in front of the whole clergy and people, could rely to this book, and more firmly be informed of the truth of the facts."''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The official delivery of the ''Cronice Illustrissimi Regis Aragonum domini Jacobi victorissimi principis'' was made on 2 June 1314&lt;ref name="Genis"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel Genís i Mas |title=La Història de Cataluña de Rafael Cervera |volume=2 |date=2012 |publisher=Universitat de Girona, Institut de Llengua i Cultura Catalanes |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10803/96917 |accessdate=10 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217212559/http://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/96917 |archivedate=17 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Church of the Friars Preachers (''església dels frares predicadors'') of Valencia.

It depicts a supper in [[Tarragona]], where James with his lords planned the [[Conquest of Majorca]]]][[File:Libre-feyts-fe.jpg|left|thumb|1343 Catalan manuscript Prologue]] Dated to 1343, the oldest surviving codex in the original Catalan language is the copy ordered by Ponç de Copons, the abbot of the [[Poblet Monastery]], as mentioned:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Aquest libre féu escriure l'onrat en Ponç de Copons, per la gràcia de Déu, abbat de l'honrat monestir de Sancta Maria de Poblet, en lo qual monestir jau lo molt alt senyor En Jaume, aqueyl que aquest libre parla, dels feyts que féu ni li endevengueren en la sua vida''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Friar Celestí des Torrents, who finished this manuscript on 17 September 1343.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This copy from the Poblet Monastery was made from an original manuscript owned by the Royal Chancellery. On 11 November 1343, King [[Peter IV of Aragon]] sent a letter to the abbot of the Poblet Monastery demanding the return of the original codex&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gimeno Blay|first=Francisco M.|date=2007-06-30|year=|title=Entre el autor y el lector: producir libros manuscritos en catalán (siglos XII-XV)|url=http://estudiosmedievales.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosmedievales/article/viewArticle/41|journal=Anuario de Estudios Medievales|language=es|volume=37|issue=1|pages=326|doi=10.3989/aem.2007.v37.i1.41|issn=1988-4230|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1585 King [[Philip II of Spain]] visited the Poblet Monastery and ordered a copy of the chronicle for the [[Real Biblioteca de San Lorenzo de El Escorial|Royal Library of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Madrid]].
[[File:Llibre-dels-Feyts-1380-f. 41r.jpg|thumb|1380 Catalan copy contains two illustrations, both of friars; this first one depicts Dominican Friar Miguel Fabra i Berenguer de Castellbisbal.]]
[[File:Llibre-dels-Feyts-1380-f. 1r.jpg|left|thumb|1380 Catalan manuscript first page: "...says My Lord Saint James that faith without actions, is dead. This word he wanted to accomplish, Lord, in our deeds..."]]
The second Catalan codex manuscript source, dating to 1380, comes directly from the Royal Chancellery of King Peter IV of Aragon, and must be a direct copy of the original, as the king himself commanded Johan de [[Barbastro]] to make it. The text in Latin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Mandato serenissimi domini petri dei gratir regis Aragonum valentiae, Majoricarum, cardinieae et Corsicae, Comitisque Barchinonae, Rossilionis et Ceritaniae [...] Ego Iohannes de Barbastro de scribania predicti domini Regis Aragonum, oriundus Cesaraugustae scripsi Ciuitate Barchinonae Anno a Nativitate Dmi. Mo. CCCo. octuagesimo sripsi''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(English: By order of Peter, by God's Grace King of [[List of Aragonese monarchs|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], [[Kingdom of Majorca|Majorca]], [[List of monarchs of Sardinia|Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]], Count of Barcelona, [[County of Roussillon|Roussillon]] and [[County of Cerdanya|Cerdanya]] [...] I Johan de Barbastro, scribe chosen by the King of Aragon [...] in the City of Barcelona, year of The Lord's Nativity, 1380)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Its prologue, in Catalan, reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Aquest es lo començament del prolech sobre el libre que feu el rey en Jacme per la gracia de Deu rey de Arago e de Mallorches e de Valencia, comte de Barchinona e d'Urgell e senyor de Muntpesler de tots los fets e de les gracies que Nostre Senyor li féu en la sua vida''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(English: This is the beginning of the prologue about the book that King James made, by Holy Grace, [[List of Aragonese monarchs|King of Aragon]], of [[List of monarchs of Majorca|Majorca]] and [[List of Valencian monarchs|Valentia]], Count of Barcelona and Count of Urgell, and Lord of Montpellier, of all his deeds and gifts our Lord gave to him in his lifetime.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A relevant fact about this copy is that Johan de [[Barbastro]] used an official codex from the Royal Chancellerie (now disappeared). King Pere IV ("the Ceremonious") ordered three copies: one for Majorca, one for Barcelona and another for Valencia. Only the Majorcan copy has survived, and is now preserved in the [[National Library of Catalonia]].

This first printed edition was ordered and paid for by the [[Valencia|Jury of the city of Valencia]] in 1557. Made in a period of historical inquiries, once the print was finished, a copy was sent to Madrid to King Philip II of Spain (known by the Catalans as [[Philip II of Castile]]) from the [[Spanish Habsburg|House of Habsburg]], who had also been very interested in the manuscript codex kept in the Poblet Monastery.

Other manuscripts have survived, all copies of the one made for the Poblet Monastery in 1343. There is one relevant codex between them conserved in the library of the University of Barcelona made by student Jaume Ferrera by order of his master, Prior Jaume Ramon Vila,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/91316141878597832532279/index.htm|title=Historia del molt alt y invictissim senyor lo Rey Don Jayme de Aragon primer de aquest nom cognomenat lo gran Conquistador.

The Prior explains the reason he ordered the present copy of the ''Llibre dels fets,'' was "to deny the forgery issues that [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] historians were throwing at [[Catalans]]". He indicates as well that the illustrations are faithful copies of the manuscript dated 1343 from the Poblet Monastery. The other relevant feature of this codex is the second original illustration that did not survive from the Poblet manuscript.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this picture we can see the [[Mayor of the Palace]], Hugh de Forcalquier, and Blasco de Alagón kneeling before James I.

'''Mummia''', '''mumia''', or originally '''mummy''' referred to several different preparations in the [[history of medicine]], from "mineral [[pitch (resin)|pitch]]" to "powdered human [[mummies]]". It originated from [[Arabic]] ''mūmiyā'' "a type of resinous [[bitumen]] found in [[Western Asia]] and used curatively" in [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|traditional Islamic medicine]], which was translated as ''pissasphaltus'' (from "pitch" and "asphalt") in [[ancient Greek medicine]]. In [[Medieval medicine of Western Europe|medieval European medicine]], ''mūmiyā'' "bitumen" was [[transliterated]] into Latin as ''mumia'' meaning both "a bituminous medicine from Persia" and "mummy". Merchants in [[apothecaries]] dispensed expensive mummia bitumen, which was thought to be an effective [[cure-all]] for many ailments. Beginning around the 12th century when supplies of imported natural bitumen ran short, mummia was misinterpreted as "mummy", and the word's meaning expanded to "a black resinous [[exudate]] scraped out from embalmed Egyptian mummies". This began a period of lucrative trade between Egypt and Europe, and suppliers substituted rare mummia exudate with entire mummies, either [[embalmed]] or [[desiccation|desiccated]]. After Egypt banned the shipment of mummia in the 16th century, unscrupulous European apothecaries began to sell fraudulent mummia prepared by embalming and desiccating fresh corpses. During the [[Renaissance]], scholars proved that translating bituminous mummia as mummy was a mistake, and physicians stopped prescribing the ineffective drug. Lastly, artists in the 17-19th centuries used ground up mummies to tint a popular oil-paint called [[mummy brown]].

==Terminology==
The [[etymologies]] of both English ''mummia'' and ''[[wikt:mummy|mummy]]'' derive from [[Medieval Latin]] ''[[wikt:mumia#Latin|mumia]]'', which transcribes [[Arabic]] ''[[wikt:مياء#Arabic|mūmiyā]]'' "a kind of bitumen used medicinally; a bitumen-embalmed body" from [[wikt:وم#Arabic|mūm]] "wax (used in embalming)", which descend from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''[[wikt:مومیا#Persian|mumiya]]'' and ''[[wikt:موم#Persian|mum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymology Dictionary, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mummy ''mummy''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', [https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=mummy ''mummy''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records the complex semantic history of ''mummy'' and ''mummia''. ''Mummy'' was first recorded meaning "a medicinal preparation of the substance of mummies; hence, an unctuous liquid or gum used medicinally" (c. 1400), which [[Shakespeare]] used jocularly for "dead flesh; body in which life is extinct" (1598), and later "a pulpy substance or mass" (1601). Second, it was [[Extension (semantics)|semantically extended]] to mean "a sovereign remedy" (1598), "a medicinal bituminous drug obtained from Arabia and the East" (1601), "a kind of wax used in the transplanting and grafting of trees" (1721), and "a rich brown bituminous pigment" (1854). The third ''mummy'' meaning was "the body of a human being or animal embalmed (according to the ancient Egyptian or some analogous method) as a preparation for burial" (1615), and "a human or animal body desiccated by exposure to sun or air" (1727). ''Mummia'' was originally used in ''mummy'''s first meaning "a medicinal preparation…" (1486), then in the second meaning "a sovereign remedy" (1741), and lastly to specify "in mineralogy, a sort of bitumen, or mineral pitch, which is soft and tough, like shoemaker's wax, when the weather is warm, but brittle, like pitch, in cold weather. It is found in Persia, where it is highly valued" (1841). In modern English usage, ''mummy'' commonly means "embalmed body" as distinguished from ''mummia'' "a medicine" in historical contexts.

''Mummia'' or ''mumia'' is defined by three English [[mineralogical]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;All definitions are from the ''OED'' (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bitumen]]'' (from Latin ''bitūmen'') originally meant "a kind of mineral pitch found in Palestine and Babylon, used as mortar, etc. The same as asphalt, mineral pitch, Jew's pitch, ''Bitumen judaicum''", and in modern scientific use means "the generic name of certain mineral inflammable substances, native hydrocarbons more or less oxygenated, liquid, semi-solid, and solid, including naphtha, petroleum, asphalt, etc." ''[[Asphalt]]'' (from Ancient Greek ''ásphaltos'' "asphalt, bitumen”) first meant "A bituminous substance, found in many parts of the world, a smooth, hard, brittle, black or brownish-black resinous mineral, consisting of a mixture of different hydrocarbons; called also mineral pitch, Jews' pitch, and in the [Old Testament] 'slime'", and presently means "A composition made by mixing bitumen, pitch, and sand, or manufactured from natural bituminous limestones, used to pave streets and walks, to line cisterns, etc.", used as an abbreviation for [[asphalt concrete]]. Until the 20th century, the Latinate term ''asphaltum'' was also used. ''[[wikt:Pissasphalt|Pissasphalt]]'' (from Greek ''pissasphaltus'' "pitch" and "asphalt") names "A semi-liquid variety of bitumen, mentioned by ancient writers".

The medicinal use of bituminous mummia has a parallel in [[Ayurveda]]: ''[[shilajit]]'' or ''silajit'' (from Sanskrit ''shilajatu'' "rock-conqueror") or ''[[mumijo]]'' (from Persian ''mūmiyā'' "wax") is "A name given to various solid or viscous substances found on rock in India and Nepal … esp. a usu. dark-brown odoriferous substance which is used in traditional Indian medicine and probably consists principally of dried animal urine".

==History==
The chronicle of how mummia became "a lengthy and unusual chapter in the history of medicine" began with the famous Persian ''mumiya'' black pissasphalt remedy for wounds and fractures, which was confused with similarly appearing black bituminous materials used in Egyptian mummification, then was misinterpreted by Medieval Latin translators to mean whole mummies, and further complicated by greed for profitable fake mummy drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Karl H. Dannenfeldt (1985), "Egyptian Mumia: The Sixteenth Century Experience and Debate", ''The Sixteenth Century Journal'' 16.2: 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bitumen or asphalt had many uses in the ancient world such as glue, mortar, and waterproofing. The [[ancient Egypt]]ians began to use bitumen for [[embalming]] mummies during the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] (1991-1802 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Herbert (1938), [https://archive.org/details/asphaltsandallie031010mbp Asphalts and Allied Substances: Their Occurrence, Modes of Production, Uses in the Arts, and Methods of Testing], D. Van Nostrand Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. G. F. Brandon, "Mummification." Man, Myth and Magic: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Supernatural.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historians of pharmacy, mummia became part of the [[materia medica]] of the Arabs, discussed by [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] (845-925) and [[Ibn al-Baitar]] (1197-1248).&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph and Lu Gwei-djen (1974), ''Science and Civilization in China. Vol. 5., Part 2. Chemistry and Chemical Technology. Part II. Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Magisteries of Gold and Immortality'', Cambridge University Press, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Arab physicians used bitumen/asphalt both as a salve for cuts, bruises, and bone fractures, and as an internal medicine for stomach ulcers and tuberculosis. They achieved the best results with a black pissasphalt that seeped from a mountain in [[Darabgerd]], Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, Heather Anne (2001), ''The Mummy Congress: Science, Obsession, and the Everlasting Dead'', Barnes &amp; Noble, 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek physician [[Pedanius Dioscorides]]' c. 50-70 ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' ranked bitumen from the [[Dead Sea]] as medicinally superior to the pissasphalt from [[Apollonia (Illyria)]], both of which were considered to be an equivalent substitute for the scarce and expensive Persian ''mumiya''.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenfeldt (1985), 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Crusades]], European soldiers learned firsthand of the  drug mummia, which was considered to have great healing powers in cases of fracture and rupture.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle (2001), 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for mummia increased in Europe and since the supply of natural bitumen from Persia and the Dead Sea was limited, the search for a new source turned to the tombs of Egypt.

Misinterpreting the Latin word ''mumia'' "medicinal bitumen" involved several steps. The first was to substitute substances exuded by Egyptian mummies for the natural product.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenfeldt, Karl H. (1959), "Egypt and Egyptian Antiquities in the Renaissance", ''Studies in the Renaissance'' 6: 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab physician [[Serapion the Younger]] (fl. 12th century) wrote about bituminous mumia and its many uses, but the Latin translation of Simon Geneunsis (d. 1303) said, "Mumia, this is the mumia of the sepulchers with aloes and myrrh mixed with the liquid (humiditate) of the human body".&lt;ref&gt;Dannenfeldt (1985), 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Two 12th century Italian examples: [[Gerard of Cremona]], mistakenly translated Arabic ''mumiya'' as "the substance found in the land where bodies are buried with aloes by which the liquid of the dead, mixed with the aloes, is transformed and it is similar to marine pitch",&lt;ref&gt;Pringle (2001), 197.&lt;/ref&gt; and the physician [[Matthaeus Platearius]] said "Mumia is a spice found in the sepulchers of the dead.... That is best which is black, ill-smelling, shiny, and massive".&lt;ref&gt;Dannenfeldt (1985), 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second step was to confuse and replace the rare black exudation from embalmed corpses with the black bitumen that Egyptians used as an embalming preservative. The Baghdad physician [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi]] (1162–1231) described ancient Egyptian mummies, "In the belly and skull of these corpses is also found in great abundance called mummy",  added that although the word properly denoted bitumen or asphalt, "The mummy found in the hollows of the corpses in Egypt, differs but immaterially from the nature of mineral mummy; and where any difficulty arises in procuring the latter, may be substituted in its stead." &lt;ref&gt;Dannenfeldt (1985), 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third step in misinterpreting ''mummia'' was to substitute the blackened flesh of an entire mummy for the hardened bituminous materials from the interior cavities of the cadavers.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenfeldt (1985), 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient tombs of Egypt and the deserts could not meet the European demand for the drug mumia, so a commerce developed in the manufacture and sale of fraudulent mummies, sometimes called ''mumia falsa''.&lt;ref name=Forbes1858&gt;{{citation |year=1958 |author=R.J. Forbes|title=Studies in Early Petroleum History |pages=166–167 |place=[[Leiden]], Netherlands |publisher=E.J. Brill |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eckUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22mumia+falsa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6oARTLWpEIvJcay27YoI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mumia%20falsa%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian surgeon [[Giovanni da Vigo]] (1450-1525) defined mumia as "The flesh of a dead body that is embalmed, and it is hot and dry in the second [grade], and therefore it has virtue to incarne [i.e., heal over] wounds and to staunch blood", and included it in his list of essential drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenfeldt (1985),  170-171.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Swiss-German polymath [[Paracelsus]] (1493-1541) gave mummia a new meaning of "intrinsic spirit" and said true pharmaceutical mummia must be "the body of a man who did not die a natural death but rather died an unnatural death with a healthy body and without sickness". The German physician [[Oswald Croll]] (1563-1609) said mumia was "not the liquid matter which is found in the Egyptian sepulchers," but rather "the flesh of a man that perishes a violent death, and kept for some time in the air", and gave a detailed recipe for making tincture of mumia from the corpse of a young red-haired man, who had been hanged, bludgeoned on the [[breaking wheel]], exposed to the air for days, then cut into small pieces, sprinkled with powdered myrrh and aloes, soaked in wine, and dried.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenfeldt (1985), 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance]] scholars and physicians first expressed opposition to using human mumia in the 16th century. The French naturalist [[Pierre Belon]] (1517-1564) concluded that the Arab physicians, from whom the western writers derived their knowledge of mumia, had actually referred to the pissasphalt of Dioscorides, which had been misconstrued by the translators. He said Europeans were importing both the "falsely called" mumia obtained from the scraping the bodies of cadavers, and "artificial mumia" made by exposing buried dead bodies to the heat of the sun before grinding them up. While he considered the available mumia to be a valueless and even dangerous drug, he noted that King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] always carried with him a mixture of mumia and rhubarb to use as an immediate remedy for any injury.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenfeldt (1985), 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[barber surgeon]] [[Ambroise Paré]] (d. 1590) revealed the manufacture of fake mummia both in France, where apothecaries would steal the bodies of executed criminals, dry them in an oven, and sell the flesh; and in Egypt, where a merchant, who admitted collecting dead bodies and preparing mummia, expressed surprise that the Christians, "so dainty-mouthed, could eat the bodies of the dead".&lt;ref&gt;Dannenfeldt (1959), 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Paré admitted to having personally administered mumia a hundred times, but condemned "this wicked kinde of Drugge, doth nothing helpe the diseased," and so he stopped prescribing it and encouraged others not to use mumia.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenfeldt (1985), 176-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The English herbalist [[John Gerard]]'s 1597 ''Herball'' described the ancient Egyptians using [[Cedar wood|cedar]] pitch for embalming, and noted that the preserved bodies that shopkeepers falsely call "mumia" should be what the Greeks called ''pissasphalton''. Gerard blamed the error on the translator of Serapion who interpreted mumia "according to his own fancie" that it is the exudate from an embalmed human corpse.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenfeldt (1985), 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical use of Egyptian mumia continued through the 17th century. The physicist [[Robert Boyle]] (1627-1691) praised it as "one of the useful medicines commended and given by our physicians for falls and bruises, and in other cases too." The Dutch physician [[Steven Blankaart]]'s 1754 ''Lexicon medicum renovatum'' listed four types of mumia: Arabian exudate from bodies embalmed with spices and asphalt, Egyptian bodies embalmed with pissasphalt, sun-dried bodies found in the desert, the natural pissasphalt.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenfeldt (1985), 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Mummia's familiarity as a remedy in Britain is demonstrated by passing references in [[Shakespeare]], [[Francis Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], and [[John Donne]], and also by more detailed remarks in the writings of [[Thomas Browne]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Robert Boyle]].&lt;ref&gt;Daly, Nicholas (1994), "That Obscure Object of Desire: Victorian Commodity Culture and Fictions of the Mummy", ''NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction'' 28.1: 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 18th century, skepticism about the pharmaceutical value of mumia was increasing, and medical opinion was turning against its use. The English medical writer [[John Quincy (medical writer)|John Quincy]] wrote in 1718 that although mumia was still listed in medicinal catalogues, "it is quite out of use in Prescription".&lt;ref&gt;Dannenfeldt (1985), 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Mummia was offered for sale medicinally as late as 1924 in the price list of [[Merck &amp; Co.]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magazine.emerck/darmstadt_germany/culture/mummies/powdered_mummies_used_as_medicine.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Both mummia and asphalt have long been used as pigments. The British chemist and painter [[Arthur Herbert Church]] described the use of mummia for making "mummy brown" oil paint:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'Mummy,' as a pigment, is inferior to prepared, but superior to raw, asphalt, inasmuch as it has been submitted to a considerable degree of heat, and has thereby lost some of its volatile hydrocarbons. Moreover, it is usual to grind up the bones and other parts of the mummy together, so that the resulting powder has more solidity and is less fusible than the asphalt alone would be. A London colourman informs me that one Egyptian mummy furnishes sufficient material to satisfy the demands of his customers for twenty years. It is perhaps scarcely necessary to add that some samples of the pigment sold as 'mummy' are spurious.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur H. Church (1901), [https://books.google.com/books?id=AtFAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA236 ''The Chemistry of Paints and Painting''], 236.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The modern pigment sold as "mummy brown" is composed of a mixture of [[kaolin]], [[quartz]], [[goethite]] and [[hematite]].

| Entered [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] service in April 1968. It was reclassified EO 45 in 1978. On 21 May 1980 EO 45 along with EOs 51 and 74 derailed at Goat Creek due to a washout. The 'EO' was later taken to [[Addington Railway Workshops]] for repairs. Withdrawn on 16 July 1997 due to the end of the [[Otira]] Tunnel electrification. It was stored at Linwood Locomotive Depot until being moved to the Ferrymead Heritage Park a year later. While there it saw occasional uses with EOs 68 and 74. Moved to [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]] in 2004. In 2007 EO 45 was transferred to Hutt Workshops for an overhaul for uses for push/pull Wellington commuter services. Re-entered service on 8 December a year later. Its last run was on 10 November 2011. EO 45 was later withdrawn again on the 28 in the same month. It was donated to the NRMNZ in March 2013 and arrived on 15 July in the same year. It is currently stored on the museums rail connection until the museum is complete.

{{More footnotes|date=March 2012}}
'''New Christian''' ({{lang-es|cristiano nuevo}}; {{lang-pt|cristão-novo}}; {{lang-ca|cristià nou}}) was a law-effective and social category developed from the 15th century onwards, and used in what is today [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] as well as their [[New World]] colonies, to refer to [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Muslim]]s ("[[Moors]]") who had converted to the [[Catholic Church]], usually by force or coercion. It was developed and employed after the [[Reconquista]] of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the [[Catholic Monarchs]].

By law, the category of New Christian included not only recent converts, but also all their known [[Baptism|baptized]] descendants with any fraction or quantum of New Christian blood up to the fourth generation, and then in [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]]'s reign it included any person with any fraction of New Christian blood "from time immemorial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=1995 |title=Jewish Folklore and Ethnology Review, Volumes 17-18 |publisher=Simon Bronner |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=D2rYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA79&amp;dq=anusim+generations&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QJkcVfe_HoX18QWQjIKQBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=fourth&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Portugal, it was only in 1772 that [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal]], finally decreed an end to the legal distinction between New Christians and [[Old Christian]]s.

==New Christian as a legal category==
Although the category of New Christian is meaningless in [[Christian theology]], it was nevertheless introduced by the Old Christians who claimed "pure unmixed" Spanish European bloodlines.

The Old Christians wanted to legally and socially distinguish themselves from the New Christian [[converso]]s (converts to Christianity), who they considered to be tainted by virtue of their non-Spanish bloodlines, even though in the case of Muslims, the overwhelming majority of Spain's Muslims were also of indigenous Iberian stock, themselves the descendants of native Iberians who earlier converted to Islam under Muslim rule.&lt;ref name="Hughes2007"&gt;{{cite video |last=Hughes| first=Bethany |title=When the Moors Ruled Europe |accessdate=14 January 2015 |date=2007 |publisher=Princeton University |quote=The people who were being thrust out were as native to the peninsula as the Christian kings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, for New Christians of Jewish origin, the conception of New Christian was a legal mechanism and manifestation of [[racial antisemitism]], being a prejudice against Jews as a racial/ethnic group, rather than [[Judaism]] as a religion. For those of Moorish origin, it was a manifestation of racial anti-Berberism and/or [[anti-Arabism]].

===Cleanliness of blood and related concepts===
{{further|Limpieza de sangre}}
The related Spanish development of an ideology of [[limpieza de sangre]] (cleanliness of blood) also excluded New Christians from society &amp;mdash; universities, emigration to the New World, many professions &amp;mdash; regardless of their sincerity as converts.

Other derogatory terms applied to each of the converting groups included [[marrano]]s (i.e. "pigs") for New Christians of Jewish origin, and [[morisco]]s (a term which carried [[pejorative]] connotations) for New Christians of [[al-Andalus|Andalusian origin]].

==Discrimination and persecution==
Aside from [[social stigma]] and [[ostracism]], the consequences of legal or social categorization as a New Christian included restrictions of [[civil and political rights]], abuses of those already-limited civil rights, social and sometimes legal restrictions on who one could marry ([[anti-miscegenation laws]]), social restrictions on where one could live, legal restrictions of entry into the professions and the clergy, legal restrictions and prohibition of immigration to and settlement in the newly colonized [[Hispanic America|Spanish territories in the Americas]], deportation from the colonies.

In addition to the above restrictions and discrimination endured by New Christians, the Spanish Crown and Church authorities also subjected New Christians to [[persecution]], [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] and [[capital punishment]] for actual or alleged practice of the family's former religion.

After the [[Alhambra Decree|Alhambra Decree of expulsion of the Jewish population from Spain]] in 1492 and a similar Portuguese decree in 1497, the remaining Jewish population in Iberia became officially Christian by default. The New Christians, especially those of Jewish origin, were always under suspicion of being ''judaizantes'' ("judaizers"), that is, [[apostasy|apostizing]] from the Christian religion and being active [[crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]].

==Emigration==

===Jewish "New Christian" emigration===
{{See also|Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Sephardic Bnei Anusim|Neo-Western Sephardim}}
Despite the discrimination and legal restrictions, many Jewish-origin New Christians found ways of circumventing these restrictions for [[emigration]] and settlement in the Iberian colonies of the New World, by falsifying or buying "cleanliness of blood" documentation, or attaining [[perjury|perjured]] [[affidavit]]s attesting to untainted Old Christian pedigrees. The descendants of these, who could not return to Judaism, became the modern-day Christian-professing [[Sephardic Bnei Anusim]] of [[Latin America]] (it is only in the modern era that a nascent community, the Neo-Western Sephardim, is currently returning to Judaism from among this population).

Also as a result of the unceasing trials and persecutions by the Inquisition, other Jewish-origin New Christians opted to migrate out of the Iberian Peninsula in a continuous flow between the 1600s to 1800's towards [[Amsterdam]], and also [[London]], whereupon in their new tolerant environment of refuge outside the [[Hispanophone|Iberian cultural sphere]] they eventually returned to [[Judaism]]. The descendants of these became the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] (also known more ambiguously in the Netherlands as [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]], among other names elsewhere).

===Muslim "New Christian" emigration===
Although Iberian Muslims were protected in the treaty signed at the [[Granada War#Last stand at Granada|fall of Granada]], and the New Christian descendants of former Muslims weren't expelled until over a century later, even so, in the meantime, different waves of Iberian Muslims and New Christians of Moorish origin left and settled across [[North Africa]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==History of New Christian conversions==

===Spain===
Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], Sephardim (Iberian Jews) and Moros (Iberian Muslims) sometimes converted to Christianity, usually as the result of coercion: physical, economic, and social pressures.{{dubious|date=November 2017}}{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In the 14th century there was increasing pressure, especially against the Jews, that culminated in the [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacre of 1391|riots of 1391]] in [[Seville]] and other cities in which many Jews were massacred. These riots caused the destruction of the [[Aljama]]s (Jewish quarters) of the cities and sparked many conversions, a trend that continued throughout the 15th century.

===Portugal===
Unlike the other Iberian kingdoms, Portugal was not much affected by the waves of riots. However, there, the Jews remaining on Portuguese soil were [[forced conversion|forcefully converted]] in 1497, after which New Christians became a numerous part of the population.

==Inquisition==
The governments of Spain and Portugal created the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1478 and the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] in 1536 as a way of dealing with social tensions, supposedly justified by the need to fight heresy. Communities believed correctly that many New Christians were secretly practicing their former religions to any extent possible, becoming crypto-Jews and [[Crypto-Islam|crypto-Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Gilman, ''The Spain of Fernando de Rojas; the intellectual and social landscape of "La Celestina"'', Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1972, {{ISBN|0691062021}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Childers. "'Según es cristiana la gente': The Quintanar of ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda|Persiles y Sigismunda]]'' and the Archival Record", ''Cervantes'', journal of the [[Cervantes Society of America]], vol. 24, no. 2, 2004 [2005], pp. 5-41, https://web.archive.org/web/20100705071410/http://users.ipfw.edu/JEHLE/cervante/csa/articf04/childers.pdf, retrieved 11/17/2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Christian surnames==

===Jewish "New Christian" surnames===
{{further|Jewish surname}}
After [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]], New Christians of Jewish origin generally adopted Christian [[given name]]s and Old Christian [[surname]]s. Eventually, all Old Christian given names and surnames were in use by New Christians of Jewish origin.

Among descendants of Sephardic Jews today, there are three categories of descendants:
# Those who are today Jewish because they descend from Sephardim who remained Jewish (never becoming New Christians), and left Iberia before the deadline set in the [[Alhambra Decree]]. See also [[Sephardi Jews#Eastern Sephardim|Eastern Sephardim]] and [[Sephardi Jews#North African Sephardim|North African Sephardim]].
# Those who are today Jewish because they descended from Sephardim who initially became New Christians because they did not, or could not, leave Iberia by the deadline set in the Alhabra Decree, but later reverted to Judaism (even if generations later) once they finally left Iberia by venturing to places other than the Iberian colonies in the Americas. See also [[Sephardi Jews#Western Sephardim|Western Sephardim]].
# Those who are today fully assimilated as Spanish, Portuguese, Hispanic or Brazilian Christians, since they descend from Sephardim who became New Christians, never reverted to Judaism in any subsequent generation, because they could not leave Iberia or they ventured to the [[Ibero-America|Iberian colonies in the Americas]], where the Inquisition eventually followed them. See also [[Sephardic Bnei Anusim]].
Generally, it is only those who descend from group 1 who carry surnames which typically identify the surname-carrier as a person of Jewish origins. The other descendants of Sephardic Jews (those from group 2, and especially those from group 3) almost always carry "Old Christian" [[Spanish naming customs|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese name|Portuguese surnames]] because they became nominal Christians, whether intermittently or permanently.

For group 3 especially, only a very and extremely limited number of surnames carried by modern-day Spanish, Portuguese, Hispanics and Brazilians who descend from Jewish New Christians are surnames which are exclusively Jewish "New Christian" surnames being capable of, on their own, indicating Jewish origins of the surname-carrier. The great majority of their surnames are, per se, Old Christian surnames, and these surnames alone cannot indicate a Jewish origin without accompanying [[genealogy|genealogical documentation]], family traditions and customs, and/or [[Genealogical DNA test]]ing.

Although it is true that a few surnames became popularly adopted by New Christians (including, for example the surname [[Pérez]], because of its similarity to the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] surname [[Peretz]]), such popularly adopted surnames by New Christians remain Old Christian surnames in origin, and carrying these surnames does '''not''' indicate Jewish ancestry by itself.

This phenomenon is much the same as is the situation with surnames which are typically considered to be Ashkenazi "Jewish" surnames. Most "Jewish" surnames among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] are not in fact "Jewish" per se, but are simply [[German name|German]] or [[Slavic names|Slavic]] surnames (including so-called "Jewish" names like "Goldberg") which were adopted by Ashkenazi Jews, some of which became so overwhelmingly carried by Jews that they came to be seen as "Jewish", although there are gentile carriers of those same surnames, because it is with those gentile families that the surnames originated to begin with. Only some surnames found among Ashkenazi Jews today are surnames which are exclusively "Jewish" surnames being capable of, on their own, indicating Jewish origins of the carrier.

The '''Organization of Yugoslav Nationalists''' (''Organizacija Jugoslavenskih Nacionalista'', ''ORJUNA''; ''Организација Југославенских Националиста'', ''ОРЈУНА''), was a political organization in [[Yugoslavia]] that existed from 1921 to 1929. It supported [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav nationalism]], promoted the creation of a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] state, and attacked [[communism]], [[democracy]], [[Jews]]{{dubious|date=August 2018}}, separatists, [[Croatian nationalism|Croatian nationalists]], and [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalists]].{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=745}} Its leader was [[Milan Pribićević]].{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=187}}{{dubious|date=February 2015}} It is believed to have been influenced by [[fascism]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=59}} It was created in Split, in 1921, in order to fight communist insurgency and Croat separatism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.pt/books?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=PA745&amp;lpg=PA745&amp;dq=orjuna+fought+croatian+separatism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vyhQWbSuSm&amp;sig=HWhT8l_aHtawAGhbYsQypNOIFGQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjBltqml9vcAhUC6aQKHT9FB1kQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=orjuna%20fought%20croatian%20separatism&amp;f=false World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1] page 745&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Plakat Organizacija jugoslov. nacionalista Vič-Glince 1923.jpg|thumb|left|ORJUNA newsletter from 1923.]]
[[File:ORJUNA poster 1925.png|thumb|left|ORJUNA poster for its 1925 congress.]]
ORJUNA was founded in March 1921 in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] by the royal administrator of Croatia and funded by the provincial government to secure Yugoslavia from threats posed by communists, separatists, and other persons deemed threatening to the state.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=58-59}}  The first president was [[Marko Nani]] and the first secretary [[Edo Bulat]]. The first actions organized by JNNO were demonstrations against [[communist]]s because of the communist assassination of the Minister of Interior Milorad Drašković. JNNO organized demonstrations in Split, [[Zagreb]] and [[Osijek]]. In Zagreb, JNNO members even demolished offices of newspapers that blamed the government for assassination.

It was particularly influential in areas of [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] that were of interest to [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Austria]]n [[irredentism]] as well as in areas where ethnic minorities where viewed to be powerful or separatist, such as [[Hungarians]] in [[Vojvodina]]. The membership of the movement was ethnically mixed of the various [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] nationalities. However most of its members were Croats from [[Dalmatia]].{{sfn|Sugar|197|p=137}} It ran its own newspapers, had an academic club, a labour organization, a high school students wing "Young Yugoslavia", and a [[paramilitary]] organization, the Action Section.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=745}}

After 1922 people of all age groups started to join the organization, which changed its name in May 1922 to ORJUNA. ORJUNA's main political goal was maintaining a unitary Yugoslav state. Its members clashed with Austrian and Italian border patrols.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=745}} ORJUNA never participated directly in elections but its supporters voted for Yugoslav oriented parties. In 1929, when the King proclaimed his personal [[dictatorship]] and disbanded the parliament, ORJUNA supported the King's action, but because the King outlawed all political parties and organizations ORJUNA ceased to exist.

By 1925, ORJUNA's Action Groups accounted for 10,000 people.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=59}}

==Ideology==
The primary ideological component of ORJUNA was Yugoslav nationalism, as opposed to particularist/chauvinist tendencies.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
ORJUNA is believed to have been influenced by fascism in that like the original [[Italian Fascism]] had a similar organizational structure including a Yugoslav version of the ''[[Duce]]'' ("Leader"), titled ''Vođa'' and like Italian Fascism it glorified violence, including in its mottoes "Victory or Death" and "Whoever is not with us, is against us!".{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=59}}

{{Rastafari}}
'''Persecution of members of the [[Rastafari movement]]''', a group founded in [[Jamaica]] in the early 1930s and who worship [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]] as [[God|Almighty God]], has been fairly continuous since the movement began but nowadays is particularly concerning their [[Spiritual use of cannabis|spiritual]] use of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].

The first Rastafari to appear in a court was [[Leonard Howell]] in Jamaica in 1934 who was charged with sedition for refusing to accept [[George V of the United Kingdom]] as his King, instead insisting that he was only loyal to Haile Selassie and [[Ethiopia]]. He was found guilty and sentenced to several years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

By the 1950s, Rastafari's message of pride and unity had unnerved the ruling class of Jamaica. In 1954, the Pinnacle commune was destroyed by Jamaican authorities.

Attitudes began to change when [[Haile Selassie I]] visited Jamaica in April 1966.

According to many Rastas, the [[Legal issues of cannabis|illegality of cannabis]] in many nations is evidence of '''persecution of Rastafari'''. They are not surprised that it is illegal, seeing it as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth&amp;nbsp;– something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; They contrast it to alcohol and other drugs, which they feel destroy the mind.&lt;ref&gt;''Chanting Down Babylon'', p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Attorney General of the United States]] [[Janet Reno]] gave a legal opinion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dip1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR34&amp;lpg=PR34&amp;dq=1998+attorney+general+janet+reno+cannabis+rasta#v=onepage&amp;q=1998%20attorney%20general%20janet%20reno%20cannabis%20rasta&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Drug Policy|publisher=|isbn=9781452266282|author1=Kleiman|first1=Mark A. R|last2=Hawdon|first2=James E|date=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Rastafari do not have the religious right to smoke marijuana in violation of the United States' [[War on drugs|drug laws]]. The position is the same in the United Kingdom, where, in the Court of Appeal case of R. v. Taylor [2002] 10&amp;nbsp;million. App. R. 37, it was held that the UK's prohibition on cannabis use did not contravene the right to freedom of religion conferred under the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]].

On January 2, 1991, at an international airport in his homeland of [[Guam]], Ras Iyah Ben Makahna (Benny Guerrero) was arrested for possession and importation of marijuana and seeds. He was charged with importation of a controlled substance. The case was heard by the US 9th Circuit Court November 2001, and in May 2002 the court had decided that the practice of Rastafari sanctions the smoking of marijuana, but nowhere does the religion sanction the importation of marijuana. Guerrero's lawyer Graham Boyd pointed out that the court's ruling was "equivalent to saying wine is a necessary sacrament for some Christians but you have to grow your own grapes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/coa/newopinions.nsf/55215A562F6A670188256BC7005C6CC5/$file/0071247.pdf?openelement Case No. 00-71247 United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, however, the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Italian Supreme Court]] ruled that Rastafari may be allowed to possess greater amounts of cannabis legally, owing to its use by them as a sacrament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL1041616220080710 |title=Rasta pot smokers win legal leeway in Italy |publisher=Reuters |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=2010-02-01 | first=Phil | last=Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Rasta Doug Darrell was arrested after a National Guard helicopter flying over his [[New Hampshire]] home found he was growing 15 marijuana plants in his backyard. In a subsequent trial in September 2012, Darrell was found "not guilty" by twelve jurors exercising the right of [[jury nullification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/17/doug-darrell-marijuana-jury-nullification_n_1890824.html |title=Doug Darrell Acquitted of Marijuana Charges Through Jury Nullification in New Hampshire |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacramental use of Cannabis in celebration of the Rastafari faith became legal in Jamaica on April 15, 2015.

'''''Piet Pienter en Bert Bibber''''' was a [[Belgian comics|Belgian comic]] series, published between 1951 and 1995, created by [[Pom (comics)|Pom]] (Jozef Van Hove).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/948/Kunst-Literatuur/article/detail/1066607/2010/02/12/Vervolg-op-stripalbum-Piet-Pienter-en-Bert-Bibber.dhtml |language=Dutch |title=Vervolg op stripalbum Piet Pienter en Bert Bibber |date=12 February 2010 |publisher=HLN }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a humoristic adventure strip about two friends, Piet Pienter and Bert Bibber and their female friend Susan.

It was published in the [[Flanders|Flemish]] dialect and notable for being one of the few comics series to never fully adapt the standard [[Dutch language]]&lt;ref name="canvas.be"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cobra.canvas.be/cm/cobra/boek/1.1005218|title="IK LEEF TEGEN MIJN GOESTING"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222100717/http://cobra.canvas.be/cm/cobra/boek/1.1005218|archivedate=December 22, 2015 |deadurl=y|date=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, apart from the final album, remained published in black-and-white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripverhalen.net/html/reeksen.php?idx=21|title=Stipverhalen.net: Homepage stripverhalen van de Frans-Belgische school|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creator Pom also enjoyed making [[pun]]s and drawing funny signs in the background, often spoofing well known advertisements. For instance: "Oma wast beter" (literally: "Grandma does the laundry better", a pun on the [[detergent]] brand ''Omo''). He was particularly notorious for adding [[irony|ironic]] commentary about his own stories while narrating the story.

''Piet Pienter en Bert Bibber'' 's popularity was considerable, but proved to be mostly a local Flemish phenomenon; being published in Antwerp newspapers, it was above all popular in that area. Over the years Pom started to dislike his profession, causing new albums to appear less and less frequent. In 1995 the series was terminated, because a certain type of paper that he used for all his stories wasn't produced anymore.&lt;ref name="canvas.be"/&gt; Since Pom strongly disliked giving interviews or providing any sort of media attention to himself or his characters ''Piet Pienter en Bert Bibber'', the series faded somewhat out of public view over the decades, despite being fondly remembered by many comics fans.&lt;ref name="humo.be"/&gt;

==History==

The first story was published in 1950, in the Antwerp newspaper ''[[Het Handelsblad]]''.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.scarlet.be/deludo/pom.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318003127/http://home.scarlet.be/deludo/pom.html|title=Pom-biografie|date=18 March 2007|publisher=|archivedate=2007-03-18|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the tenth album on, in 1955,&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;  all stories were pre-published in the daily ''[[Gazet van Antwerpen]]''. The albums were published by Uitgeverij De Vlijt, who also published that newspaper. In 1995 the final story was published by [[Standaard Uitgeverij]], who took over the reprints of all the previous albums too.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

In 2010 comics artist [[Tom Bouden]] drew a [[homage (arts)|homage]] album about ''Piet Pienter en Bert Bibber''. He received official permission to use the characters, provided that it remained a one-shot album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/cultuur%2Ben%2Bmedia/kunsten/1.715064|title=Comeback voor Piet Pienter &amp; Bert Bibber|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319023226/http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/cultuur+en+media/kunsten/1.715064|archivedate=March 19, 2012|date=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another homage album, "Op het spoor van Pom" (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/pom.htm?lan=dutch|title=Pom|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained contributions by 60 Flemish comics artists, with the money being spent for [[cancer]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripweb.be/S-stripverhaal-op-het-spoor-van-pom-bestellen-10467.asp|title=Op het spoor van Pom|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
* '''Piet Pienter''': Piet is the hero and [[straight man (stock character)|straight man]] of the series. As his name implies he is very smart ("pienter" means "clever" in Dutch) and usually more calm and level-headed. He is furthermore notable for smoking pipe&lt;ref name="humo.be"/&gt; and according to "Het Vredeswapen" an [[engineer]], especially into electronics, much like Pom himself.
* '''Bert Bibber''': Bert is Piet's best friend and shares house with him. As his name implies he is kind of a coward ("bibber" means "shiver" in Dutch). Due to his impulsive nature, tendency to panick or get aggressive, and general stupidity&lt;ref name="humo.be"/&gt; he provides most of the [[comic relief]] in the series. In "In het spoor van Sherlock Holmes" he is a [[private detective]], while in early albums like "Het gestolen Vredeswapen". "De Incaschat der Cordillera" and "Het Raadsel van de Schimmenburcht" he is a [[Door-to-door|travelling salesman]]. 
* '''Susan''': Susan is the daughter of an American billionaire.&lt;ref name="humo.be"/&gt; She is a feisty and attractive young woman who has often helped Piet and Bert with their problems, especially when they lack money. Bert is secretly in love with her, as is Theo Flitser; but there is no mention of either scoring any real success with her, beyond her visiting the "Ice Revue" show with Flitser. Cruising the world in her private yacht initially, over the course of the series she moves in to live at Piet and Bert's house.
* '''Professor Kumulus''': A genius professor, who provides most of the inventions and formulas that get the stories started. He is a good friend of the protagonists. 
* '''Professor Snuffel''': Another genius professor and archeologist, whose personality is mostly similar to Kumulus. In later stories he appears less frequently in favor of Kumulus.
* '''Hilarius Warwinkel''': A genius inventor and college friend of Kumulus. However, he suffers from [[alcoholism]], which causes him to make stupid mistakes that bring his inventions into the wrong hands. His appearance was based on [[Albert Einstein]].
* '''Theo Flitser''': A sensation-driven young photographer who always searches the latest scoop. Though a friend of Piet and Bert they see him as somewhat of a nuisance, especially Bert because Susan finds Theo attractive. His appearance is based on Pom's own. 
* '''Commissaris Knobbel''': The head of the local police. He is arrogant, easily agitated and dumb, and disliking Piet and Bert he tends to unjustly jail them. Usually Piet and Bert solve the cases while Knobbel takes all credit for it.

{{History of Bangladesh}}

The independence of [[Bangladesh]] was declared on 26 March 1971 at the onset of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. The message of declaration was sent by [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] just before his incarceration by the Pakistani Army and later on March 27, it was broadcast by Major [[Ziaur Rahman]] on behalf of Sheikh Mujib. The declaration was widely circulated in the international press in late March 1971. On 17 April, the [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh]] issued a proclamation on the basis of the previous declaration and established an interim constitution for the independence movement.

==First declarations==
On 25 March 1971, negotiations between Pakistani President [[Yahya Khan]] and Awami League leader [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] broke down after Khan refused to accept Rahman's plan for a new federal constitution in Pakistan. Rahman's party won an absolute majority in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] during Pakistan's [[Pakistani general election, 1970|first free election]] in 1970. However, the newly elected parliament was barred from taking power due to objections from the [[Pakistani military]] and the West Pakistan establishment. The [[Awami League]]'s [[Six Point Movement|6 points]] proposal for a Pakistani federation was strongly opposed by bureaucrats and senior politicians like [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in [[West Pakistan]]. The League initiated a [[civil disobedience]] campaign in East Pakistan to press for convening the parliament, amid rising Bengali aspirations for self-determination and independence. On 7 March 1971, Rahman addressed a huge pro-independence rally in Dhaka. Yahya Khan and Bhutto were in the city throughout March for negotiations. The political process was abruptly ended by President Khan, who faced pressure from the military for a crackdown.&lt;ref name="Karim2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Karim |first=S. A. |year=2005 |title=Sheikh Mujib: triumph and tragedy |publisher=The University Press |page= |isbn=978-984-05-1737-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}

In the evening of 25 March, Mujib convened a meeting of senior Bengali nationalist leaders, including [[Tajuddin Ahmad]] and Colonel [[M A G Osmani]], at his residence in [[Dhanmondi]]. They were briefed by Bengali insiders within the military of an impending crackdown. The nationalist leaders decided to form a provisional government in exile in India and launch an armed struggle for independence. However, Mujib decided to remain in Dhaka and brave the looming crackdown, despite pleas by the others to join them in India. Bidding farewell to the leaders, Mujib said "I have given you independence. Now go and preserve it ".&lt;ref name="Karim2005"/&gt;

On the night of 25 March, the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] launched [[Operation Searchlight]] in the capital of East Pakistan. Tanks rolled out on the streets of Dhaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bass |first=Gary Jonathan |year=2014 |title=The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger, and a Forgotten Genocide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQ_lAAAAQBAJ |publisher=Vintage Books |page=50 |isbn=978-0-307-74462-3 |quote=That night [25 March] ...

At midnight, Mujib sent a wireless telegram to [[Chittagong]] instructing Awami League leaders to declare independence. The text of his telegram read:-&lt;ref name="forum"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rahman |first1=Mashuqur |last2=Jalal |first2=Mahbubur Rahman |date=March 2008 |title=Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendro and Bangladesh's Declaration of Independence |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/forum/2008/march/declaration.htm |work=Forum |publisher=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every section of the people of Bangla Desh are asked to resist the enemy forces at any cost in every corner of Bangla Desh. May Allah bless you and help in your struggle for freedom from the enemy. Joy Bangla}}

The Pakistani military proceeded to arrest Mujib from his residence around 1&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name="Karim2005"/&gt;. Just before his arrest, Mujib sent his telegraph-message for 'Declaration of Bangladeshi Independence'. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dey |first=Biddut |date=31 March 2017 |title="বঙ্গবন্ধুর স্বাধীনতা ঘোষণার টেলিগ্রাফিক বার্তা"|url=https://opinion.bdnews24.com/bangla/archives/46455|newspaper=BDNews24 |type=Opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
At 2.30&amp;nbsp;pm on 26 March 1971, Awami League leader [[M A Hannan]] began broadcasting Mujib's declaration of independence over the [[Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra|Independent Bangladesh Radio Station]] in Chittagong, which was widely reported in the international press.&lt;ref&gt;http://cbgr1971.org/files/Mar261971DecOfIndep/FinalDeclarationBSMR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forum" /&gt; The text of the declaration read:-&lt;ref name="virtualbangladesh.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/the-basics/history-of-bangladesh/independence/history-war-independence/the-declaration-of-independence/|title=The Declaration of Independence|work=Virtual Bangladesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=July 2017}}

[[Abul Kashem Khan|A K Khan]] intervened and drafted a second declaration for Zia, which was read again over Independent Bangladesh Radio.&lt;ref name="thedailystar.net"/&gt; It read the following:-&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW8swcw2Wr8|title=the first declaration by zia.wmv|date=13 April 2010|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Citation is a random guy's YouTube upload, which is not necessarily what it claims to be; a sufficiently reliable source for this would be a museum, library, national archive, or broadcaster's archive.|date=July 2017}}

I therefore appeal on behalf of our great leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to the governments of the all the democratic countries of the world, especially the big world powers, and the neighboring countries, to take effective steps to stop immediately the awful genocide that has been carried out by the army of occupation from Pakistan. To dub us, the legally elected representatives of the majority of the people as repressionist is a cruel joke and contradiction in terms which should befool none.

On 17 April 1971, the [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh]] was formed in [[Mujibnagar]]. It converted the elected Bengali members of the national and provincial assemblies of Pakistan into the [[Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh]]. The constituent assembly issued a second proclamation of independence, which also served as the [[Basic Law|fundamental law]] of Bangladesh until the adoption of the [[Constitution of Bangladesh|constitution]] in 1972. The text is given in the following:-&lt;ref&gt;http://www.docstrangelove.com/uploads/1971/sbbk/documents/Proclamation%201971_M_Dalil_Vol_03_MMR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

|PROCLAMATION OF INDEPENDENCE&lt;br /&gt;

:Mujibnagar, Bangladesh
:Dated 10th day of April 1971.&lt;br /&gt;

Whereas free elections were held in Bangladesh from 7 December 1970 to 17 January 1971, to elect representatives for the purpose of framing a Constitution,&lt;br /&gt;

AND&lt;br /&gt;

Whereas at these elections the people of Bangladesh elected 167 out of 169 representatives belonging to the Awami League,&lt;br /&gt;

AND&lt;br /&gt;

Whereas General Yahya Khan summoned the elected representatives of the people to meet on 3 March 1971, for the purpose of framing a Constitution,&lt;br /&gt;

AND&lt;br /&gt;

Whereas the Assembly so summoned was arbitrarily and illegally postponed for indefinite period,&lt;br /&gt;

AND&lt;br /&gt;

Whereas instead of fulfilling their promise and while still conferring with the representatives of the people of Bangladesh, Pakistan authorities declared an unjust and treacherous war,&lt;br /&gt;

AND&lt;br /&gt;

Whereas in the facts and circumstances of such treacherous conduct Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the undisputed leader of the 75&amp;nbsp;million people of Bangladesh, in due fulfillment of the legitimate right of self-determination of the people of Bangladesh, duly made a declaration of independence at Dacca on 26 March 1971, and urged the people of Bangladesh to defend the honour and integrity of Bangladesh,&lt;br /&gt;

AND&lt;br /&gt;

Whereas in the conduct of a ruthless and savage war the Pakistani authorities committed and are still continuously committing numerous acts of genocide and unprecedented tortures, amongst others on the civilian and unarmed people of Bangladesh,&lt;br /&gt;

AND&lt;br /&gt;

Whereas the Pakistan Government by levying an unjust war and committing genocide and by other repressive measures made it impossible for the elected representatives of the people of Bangladesh to meet and frame a Constitution, and give to themselves a Government,&lt;br /&gt;

AND&lt;br /&gt;

Whereas the people of Bangladesh by their heroism, bravery and revolutionary fervour have established effective control over the territories of Bangladesh,&lt;br /&gt;

We the elected representatives of the people of Bangladesh, as honour bound by the mandate given to us by the people of Bangladesh whose will is supreme duly constituted ourselves into a Constituent Assembly, and&lt;br /&gt;

having held mutual consultations, and&lt;br /&gt;

in order to ensure for the people of Bangladesh equality, human dignity and social justice,&lt;br /&gt;

declare and constitute Bangladesh to be sovereign Peoples' Republic and thereby confirm the declaration of independence already made by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and&lt;br /&gt;

do hereby affirm and resolve that till such time as a Constitution is framed, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman shall be the President of the Republic and that Syed Nazrul Islam shall be the Vice President of the Republic, and&lt;br /&gt;

that the President shall be the Supreme Commander of all the Armed Forces of the Republic,&lt;br /&gt;

shall exercise all the Executive and Legislative powers of the Republic including the power to grant pardon,&lt;br /&gt;

shall have the power to appoint a Prime Minister and such other Ministers as he considers necessary,&lt;br /&gt;

shall have the power to levy taxes and expend monies [sic],&lt;br /&gt;

shall have the power to summon and adjourn the Constituent Assembly, and&lt;br /&gt;

do all other things that may be necessary to give to the people of Bangladesh an orderly and just Government,&lt;br /&gt;

We the elected representatives of the people of Bangladesh do further resolve that in the event of there being no President or the President being unable to enter upon his office or being unable to exercise his powers and duties, due to any reason whatsoever, the Vice-President shall have and exercise all the powers, duties and responsibilities herein conferred on the President,&lt;br /&gt;

We further resolve that we undertake to observe and give effect to all duties and obligations that devolve upon us as a member of the family of nations and under the Charter of United Nations,&lt;br /&gt;

We further resolve that this proclamation of independence shall be deemed to have come into effect from 26th day of March 1971.&lt;br /&gt;

We further resolve that in order to give effect to this instrument we appoint Prof. Yusuf Ali our duly Constituted Potentiary and to give to the President and the Vice-President oaths of office.&lt;br /&gt;

PROF. YUSUF ALI&lt;br /&gt;
Duly Constituted Potentiary&lt;br /&gt;
By and under the authority&lt;br /&gt;
of the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2259">'''''Rex v Korsten'''''&lt;ref&gt;(1927) 48 NPD 12.&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African criminal law]], with its bearing on the defence of impossibility. It was heard in the Natal Provincial Division on February 7, 1927, by Dove-Wilson JP, Carter J and Matthews J. The case was an application for a ruling in terms of section 58 of the Criminal and Magistrates' Courts Procedure (Amendment) Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 39 of 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; in respect of a decision by the Magistrate of Eshowe.

== Facts ==
An accused person drove his cattle to be dipped in a township dip, but was prevented from dipping them by the township foreman, because he had not complied with a by-law which provided that no person should use the dipping tank except upon production of coupons previously purchased entitling him to do so. The accused's excuse for not having purchased such coupons was that he had not known it was necessary to do so.

== Argument ==
Lennox Ward for the Crown referred to ''[[Rex v Dabulamanzi; Rex v Nkombo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;1924 SR 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judgment ==
The court held that, inasmuch as Act 14 of 1911 imposed an absolute duty on the accused to dip his cattle, the facts above set out afforded no defence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Under the Stock Diseases Act the obligation to dip is imperative. The accused had to dip and had to arrange accordingly, either by providing a tank for himself or making use of one belonging to somebody else; and it is no excuse for him to say that he was ignorant of a condition precedent to the use of the tank which he elected to dip at. It was his duty to make himself aware of it, and if his neglect to do so has brought about his failure to dip in accordance with the law, he has contravened the law.&lt;ref&gt;13.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Jetha v R]]'', some two years later, Dove-Wilson JP found that the requirements of impossibility had been met.

The '''''Ratirahasya'''''  ([[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa| रतिरहस्य }}) (translated in English as '''''Secrets of Love''''', also known as the '''''Koka Shastra''''') is a medieval [[India]]n [[sex manual]] written by Kokkoka, a poet, who is variously described as Koka or Koka Pundit.&lt;ref name="Vātsy jkedaqw    āyanaDane2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vātsyāyana|author2=Lance Dane|title=The Complete Illustrated Kama Sutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNV1BP2DCWYC&amp;pg=PT12|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=7 October 2003|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|isbn=978-0-89281-138-0|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FrayserWhitby1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Suzanne G.

Unlike the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', which is an [[Ancient India|ancient]] sex manual related to [[Hindu literature]], ''Ratirahasya'' deals with [[medieval India]]n society. During the medieval age, India became more conservative compared to ancient India, freedom of women decreased, and [[Premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]] were frowned upon. A sex manual was needed that would be suitable for the medieval cultural climate, and ''Ratirahasya'' was written, quite different from the ancient text ''Kama Sutra''.&lt;ref name="FrayserWhitby1995"/&gt;

There are fifteen ''pachivedes'' (chapters) and 800 verses in ''Ratirahasya'' which deal with various topics such as different physiques, [[lunar calendar]], different types of [[genital]]s, characteristics of women of various ages, [[hug]]s, [[kiss]]es, [[sexual intercourse]] and [[sex position]]s, sex with a strange woman, etc.&lt;ref name="Vātsy jkedaqw    āyanaDane2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FrayserWhitby1995"/&gt; Kokokka describes various stages of love in ''Ratirahasya'', the fifth stage being [[weight loss]], the ninth is [[fainting]], and the tenth and last stage is death.&lt;ref name="Lienhard1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Siegfried Lienhard|title=A History of Classical Poetry: Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E0aYeR67booC&amp;pg=PA119|accessdate=23 March 2012|year=1984|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-02425-9|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ratirahasya'' makes classifications of women, and describes [[erogenous zone]]s and days that lead to women's easy arousal.

''Ratirahasya'' is the first book to describe in detail Indian [[Femininity|feminine]] beauty. The book classified women into four psycho-physical  types, according to their appearance and physical features.&lt;ref name="Our B-I-G fix"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kazmi|first=Nikhat|title=Our B-I-G fix|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bombay-times/Our-B-I-G-fix/articleshow/722511.cms|accessdate=27 March 2012|newspaper=Times of India|date=Jun 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QI: Quite interesting facts about weddings"&gt;{{cite news|title=QI: Quite interesting facts about weddings|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/qi/8466023/QI-Quite-interesting-facts-about-weddings.html|accessdate=27 March 2012|date=21 Apr 2011| newspaper= The Telegraph|author=Molly Oldfield|author2=John Mitchinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Padmini (lotus woman)
# Chitrini (art woman)
# Shankini (conch woman)
# Hastini (elephant woman)

On the basis of the size of the genitals, the text classifies sexual intercourse into nine different types. [[Aphrodisiac]]s are also described in the book.&lt;ref name="Kar2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kar|title=Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&amp;pg=PA456|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers|isbn=978-81-8061-405-7|page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[W.G. Archer]], Kokkoka "is concerned with how to make the most of sex, how to enjoy it and how to keep a woman happy."&lt;ref name="FrayserWhitby1995"/&gt; In writing this text, Kokokka depended on a number of other authors including, among others [[Nandikeshvara]], [[Gonikaputra]], and [[Vatsyayana]].&lt;ref name="(A-mdo)1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dge-ʼdun-chos-ʼphel (A-mdo)|title=Tibetan arts of love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmxR93ZeSBMC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=23 March 2012|year=1992|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|isbn=978-0-937938-97-3|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another English translation was made by S. C. Upadhyaya, entitled ''Kokashastra (Rati Rahasya) of Pundit Kokkoka''. Some commentaries have been written on this text by [[Avana Rama Chandra]], [[Kavi Prabhu]], and [[Harihara]]. It is a popular text in India, second only to the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' among sex manuals.&lt;ref name="(A-mdo)1992"/&gt;

'''''Rejected''''' is an [[animated]] [[short film|short]] [[comedy film]] by [[Don Hertzfeldt]] that was released in 2000. It was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]] the following year at the [[73rd Academy Awards]], and received 27 awards from film festivals around the world.&lt;ref name="Bitter Films' Rejected page"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bitterfilms.com/rejected.html | title=Rejected | author= | date= | work=bitterfilms.com | accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rejected'' is now considered a [[cult classic]] and one of the most influential animated films ever made, especially after it found its way onto the internet in the early 2000s and became a viral sensation.&lt;ref name="Indiewire"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bridgerack.com/index.php/Cinemateque/A_Conversation_With_Don_Hertfeldt_Part_Three.html | title= Interview with Don Hertzfeldt | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080225161831/http://bridgerack.com/index.php/Cinemateque/A_Conversation_With_Don_Hertfeldt_Part_Three.html | archive-date=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009,  it was the only short film named as one of the "Films of the Decade" by ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''.&lt;ref name="Films of the Decade"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/films_of_the_decade/index.html?story=/ent/movies/film_salon/2009/12/31/rejected | title=Films of the Decade | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104192317/http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/films_of_the_decade/index.html?story=%2Fent%2Fmovies%2Ffilm_salon%2F2009%2F12%2F31%2Frejected | archive-date=4 January 2010 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, it was noted as one of the five "most innovative animated films of the past ten years" by ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref name="Huffington"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/26/10-innovative-film-and-ar_n_800020.html#s213580 | title=Films of the Decade | work=Huffington Post | first=Sophia | last=Morenobunge | date=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Indiewire]]'' film critic Eric Kohn named ''Rejected'' one of the "10 best films of the 21st century" on his list for the BBC Culture poll in 2016.&lt;ref name="Indiewire"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharf|first=Zack | url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/11/don-hertzfeldt-rejected-4k-restoration-video-1202017112/|title=Don Hertzfeldt Releases 4K Restoration of Iconic Short ‘Rejected,’ Remastered from the Original 35mm Film — Watch|work=IndieWire|date=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
[[File:Rejected (2000) banana frame.jpg|thumb|right|''Rejected'' makes heavy use of [[surreal humor]], such as in this scene that uses a giant spoon and an [[anthropomorphic]] banana to advertise the Family Learning Channel.]]
A fictional frame story explains that Hertzfeldt was commissioned to do animated segments for commercials and television network interstitials, but they were all rejected upon receipt. This is followed by a collection of short, surreal vignettes, presented as a reel of rejected corporate advertising work. According to the frame story, Hertzfeldt was assigned to do commercial segments for the Family Learning Channel, which were rejected after review. He would later do commercials for the Johnson &amp; Mills Corporation, which were rejected outright. After the Johnson &amp; Mills Corporation advertisements, the frame story states that Hertzfeldt began finishing commercials and shorts with his left hand. After the short segments, the story says that the rejected cartoons were running out of control, and later on fell apart. The animator begins to break down mentally and the animated world he created literally begins to (like the frame story said) fall apart, brutally killing all of his characters in the process.

==Production==

Hertzfeldt's first film after graduating from college, ''Rejected'' was photographed on a 35mm [[rostrum camera]] he purchased in 1999.

===Art style===
''Rejected'' features simple hand-drawn artwork, featuring mostly black pen animation on a white background with occasional use of color. As the film progresses and the fictionalized animator begins to fall apart, the drawings become more crude and the animation becomes more erratic. As the film concludes, the paper that the animation is drawn on begins to crumple and tear, and the characters are seen struggling to evade the destruction.

Besides the iconic ''Allegro ma non troppo'' from [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 9th]] that plays in the text introductions to each segment, a particular segment with the "Fluffy Guys" uses background music from the [[Sweden|Swedish]] Christmas song ''[[Nu är det jul igen]]''.

===Inspiration===
[[File:Rejected (2000) consumer whore frame.png|thumb|right|''Rejected''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s advertisements poke fun at [[consumerism]].]]
Although the film is fictional and Hertzfeldt has never done any advertising work, he did receive many offers to do television commercials after ''[[Billy's Balloon]]'' received international attention and acclaim. In appearances he would often tell the humorous story of how he was tempted to produce the worst possible cartoons he could come up with for the companies, run off with their money, and see if they would actually make it to air. Eventually this became the germ for ''Rejected'''s theme of a collection of cartoons so bad they were rejected by advertising agencies, leading to their creator's breakdown.

Hertzfeldt has never accepted "real" advertising work and has stated numerous times on his website and in public appearances that he never will, as he feels advertisements are "lies" and he does not want to lie to his audience.&lt;ref name="Bitter Films' FAQ"/&gt;

==Release==
===Exhibition history===
''Rejected'' world-premiered at the [[San Diego Comic Convention]] in 2000. Between hundreds of film festival appearances since then, ''Rejected'' also toured North American theaters in 2000, 2001, and 2002 with [[Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation]]; in 2001 and 2002 again with a retrospective touring program of Hertzfeldt's and animator [[Bill Plympton]]'s films called "The Don and Bill Show"; and returned to theaters once again in 2003 and 2004 with Hertzfeldt's own [[the Animation Show]] tour.&lt;ref name="Bitter Films' Rejected page" /&gt;

In 2003, two of the "Fluffy Guy" characters reappeared in three Hertzfeldt cartoons created to introduce and book-end the first year of [[the Animation Show]]: ''Welcome to the Show'', ''Intermission in the Third Dimension'', and ''the End of the Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bitterfilms.com/trilogy.html | title=Animation Show Cartoons | author= | date= | work=bitterfilms.com | accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rejected'' was scheduled to air on [[Adult Swim]] in 2001 but was delayed for unknown reasons—it was rescheduled to air in November 2002 "uncut and commercial free", and was heavily promoted on the network that week. However, the short was pulled from the schedule at the last minute, for unknown reasons. Rumors about the reasons behind this highly unusual action have included: the film's brief use of the phrase "Sweet Jesus" ("Jesus" being a word allegedly not allowed on a [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Network]] back then), and an anonymous high-ranking network executive simply not finding the short to be funny. ''Rejected'' has since aired without incident on the [[Cartoon Network]] in other countries as well as on other international television networks, but has to date never been broadcast on American television.&lt;ref name="Bitter Films' Rejected page" /&gt; However, a brief clip from the film has since aired on the Adult Swim anthology series ''[[Off the Air (TV series)|Off the Air]]'', 14 years later, in the episode Holes. The scene mentioned in the episode is the scene with the "fluffy guys" in which one announces that his "anus is bleeding."&lt;ref name="Off the Air"&gt;{{cite episode | title=Holes  | series=[[Off the Air (TV series)|Off the Air]] | network=[[Adult Swim]] | date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rejected'' returned to movie theaters in 2006 as part of the [[Sundance Institute|Sundance Institute's]] 25th anniversary "Art House Project", a special screening series of Sundance films for local audiences nationwide. ''Rejected'' was one of 5 shorts and 25 features from Sundance's history selected as "essential" and representative of the spirit of the [[Sundance Film Festival]].

Most recently, the film returned to theaters in 2008{{ndash}}2009 as part of the ''Evening with Don Hertzfeldt'' screening series.

===DVD===
Ever since its original theatrical run, the film has been a very popular target for Internet bootlegs, and in 2001 [[Bitter Films]] released a limited edition [[DVD]] "single" to give fans a proper alternative. Hertzfeldt has stated on the Bitter Films website that his concern with bootlegs has always been over quality control issues, and never a financial one.&lt;ref name="Bitter Films' FAQ"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bitterfilms.com/faq.html | title=Bitter Films' FAQ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104192317/http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/films_of_the_decade/index.html?story=%2Fent%2Fmovies%2Ffilm_salon%2F2009%2F12%2F31%2Frejected | archive-date=4 January 2010 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DVD "single" featured a deleted scene as well as an audio commentary, and is now out of print.

In 2006, ''Rejected'' was remastered and restored in high definition for inclusion on the DVD, "Bitter Films Volume 1", a compilation of Don Hertzfeldt's short films from 1995–2005.  Special features on this DVD relating to ''Rejected'' include a new text commentary by Hertzfeldt (via closed-caption boxes), footage from the abandoned cartoon "the Spanky the Bear Show" that later evolved into a central scene in the film, original pencil tests, the 2001 audio commentary, and dozens of pages devoted to Hertzfeldt's original sketches, storyboards, notes, and deleted ideas from the film.  The DVD is available exclusively from the Bitter Films website.

A 35-second deleted scene from ''Rejected'' was only released on the 2001 DVD "single". In it, a father inquires into his son's desire to drink goat's blood. The scene appears to fit in with the "Johnson &amp; Mills" portion of the original film, and is revealed to be an advertisement for cotton-swabs at the end.

{{one source|date=July 2017}}
A [[representation term]] is a word, or a combination of words, used as part of a [[data element name]]. '''''Representation class''''' is sometimes used as a [[synonym]] for representation term.

In [[ISO/IEC 11179]], a ''representation class'' provides a way to [[Taxonomic classification |classify]] or group [[data element]]s. A ''representation class'' is effectively a specialized [[classification scheme]]. Hence, there is currently some discussion in ISO over the merits of keeping representation class as a separate entity in 11179, versus collapsing it into the general classification scheme facility{{ref|Issue114}}.  A clear distinction between the two mechanisms, however, is that 11179 allows a data element to be classified by only one representation class, whereas there is no such restriction on other classification schemes.

ISO/IEC 11179 does not specify that ''representation terms'' should be drawn from the values of ''representation class'', though it would make sense to do so, nor does it provide any mechanism to ensure any sort of consistency (whatever that might mean) between the representation terms used to name a data element, and the representation class used to classify it.

The term ''representation class'' has been used in metadata registry standards for many years.  Today it has a combination of meanings and now goes well beyond how a [[data element]] is represented in a [[computer system]].  In practice this term is used to shed light on the [[semantics]] or meaning of the data element.

==Definitions of "representation class"==
There are several alternate definitions for ''representation class''.  Some of these are taken from the ISO documents.  Note that these documents are copyrighted and extracts can only be taken under the fair use rules.

===ISO Definitions of representation class===
====From ISO/IEC TR 20943-1 First edition 2003-08-01 pdf page 91====
'''B.2.3 Representation class'''

Representation class is the value domain for representation. The set of classes make it easy to distinguish among the elements in the registry. For instance, a data element categorized with the representation class '''amount''' is different from an element categorized as '''number'''. It probably will not make sense to compare the contents of these elements, or perform calculations using them together.

Representation class is a mechanism by which the functional and/or presentational category of an item may be conveyed to the user.

====From ISO/IEC 11179-3 Second edition 2003-02-15====
'''3.3.51 data element representation class'''
the class of representation of a data element

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19787">'''The Schlesinger Report''', originally titled '''A Review of the Intelligence Community''', was the product of a survey authorized by U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] late in 1970.&lt;ref name=CIALookBack&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/schlesinger-report.html |title=A Look Back … The Landmark Schlesinger Report |date=1971 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the survey was to identify and alleviate factors of ineffectiveness within the [[United States Intelligence Community]] (IC) organization, planning, and preparedness for future growth. The report, prepared by [[James Schlesinger]], Deputy Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB), was submitted to Nixon on 10 March 1971.&lt;ref name=CIALookBack/&gt;

The survey was the first of the IC reform attempts to specifically address the growing technological capabilities of the IC and their impact on the collection process.  The report highlighted two “disturbing phenomena” within the IC: an “impressive rise in…size and cost” and the “apparent inability to achieve a commensurate improvement in the scope and overall quality of intelligence products.”&lt;ref name=Reviewp1&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971, p.1]&lt;/ref&gt;  The report analyzed issues pertaining to organizational fragmentation, lack of interagency centralization, costly emerging technologies, duplication of collection and analysis, and institutional disorganization, and offered the administration several practical options for improving IC functions. Major recommendations included: creating a [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI), strengthening the role of the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI), and establishing an interagency coordinator for national intelligence functions.&lt;ref name=Reviewp1/&gt;

==History==
Following the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]], the newly elected [[Nixon administration]] immediately focused its attention on the IC.  Nixon and his [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] initially viewed the IC, particularly the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), with condescension, believing it was not sharing important information with the administration.  Additionally, Nixon felt that steadily increasing capabilities and costs directed toward IC functions should naturally be yielding a better intelligence product.  Nixon also lost faith with the analytical arm of the IC when the [[Cambodia]]n coup of 1970 took the administration by surprise.&lt;ref name=ReformStudies&gt;{{cite web |url =https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/US%20Intelligence%20Community%20Reform%20Studies%20Since%201947.pdf|title=US Intelligence Community Reform Studies since 1947|date=April 2005|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:James Schlesinger official DoD photo.jpg|thumb|right|James Schlesinger]]
Since little evidence indicated a direct correlation between intelligence expenditures and quality outputs, Nixon commissioned James Schlesinger to conduct a survey of the IC.  Schlesinger’s goal was to identify problems within the IC and recommend ideas for improvement.  While Schlesinger is credited as chief preparer of the document, it was drafted by Arnold Donohue of the OMB.&lt;ref name=ReformStudies/&gt;

==Overview of the report==
While the entire original document is still classified, the 47-page report, with redactions, has been made available through [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests.  Redacted sections include classified data, primarily regarding budgetary figures and national security issues, with the exception of [[Vietnam]].

===Sections of the report===
The report is divided into 10 sections:
*Introduction: The Costs and Benefits of Intelligence
*Cost Trends
*Questions About the Product
*Organizational Dilemmas
*Specific Organizational Issues
*Leadership of the Community
*Department of Defense Leadership
*Changing Functional Boundaries and Costs
*Toward Improvements in the Product
*Appendices (classified)

====Introduction: the costs and benefits of intelligence====
The report began by providing an overview of the need for “constructive change” within the IC.  The aim was to achieve a “closer relationship between cost and effectiveness” by seeking “fundamental reform of the community’s decisionmaking bodies and procedures.”   Schlesinger warned that in the “absence of reorganization…the habits of intelligence community will remain as difficult to control as was the performance of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] prior to the [[Defense Reorganization Act of 1958]].”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971, p.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cost trends====
This section of the report provided an historical background of the development of intelligence functions and role distinctions.  "The [[National Security Act of 1947]] and the [[National Security Council Intelligence Directives]] (NSCIDs) of the late 1940s and early 1950s established the basic division of responsibilities among agencies and departments."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;  These basic divisions granted the roles of "non-military" and "national intelligence" to CIA, particularly to employ human intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) and clandestine collection operations.&lt;ref name=Reviewp1/&gt; The [[State Department]] was tasked with the "overt collection of 'non-military' intelligence", while the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) was given the responsibility of collecting communications and signals intelligence ([[COMINT]] and [[SIGINT]]).&lt;ref name=Reviewp1 /&gt; The responsibilities of "military" and tactical "wartime" intelligence were given to the [[Military of the United States|Military Services]].&lt;ref name=Reviewp1 /&gt; All intelligence agencies and services were permitted to produce "departmental intelligence" for individual and institutional needs.&lt;ref name=Reviewp1 /&gt;

Schlesinger pointed out that these role distinctions "worked reasonably well into the mid-1950s", but went on to say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The line between "military" and "non-military" has faded; scientific and technical intelligence with both civilian and military applications has become a principal area of endeavor for almost all intelligence organizations.  Similarly, under the old distinctions, the national leadership--namely the President and the NSC--concerned itself with "national" intelligence, while presumably only battlefield commanders cared about tactical intelligence.  But a rapidly advancing technology which has revolutionized the collection, processing, and communication of intelligence data casts doubt on the validity of the distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p.4]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This "faded" distinction had resulted in four fundamental problems that contributed to the increasing cost of IC activities:
#Functions had become fragmented and disorganized.
#Competition for collection had resulted in community-wide, unproductive duplication.
#IC was inadequately prepared for growth.
#Fragmentation and the scramble for new technologies had resulted in exceedingly expensive activities.&lt;ref name=Reviewp1 /&gt;

====Questions about the product====
As the IC was increasingly shifting resources towards collection, there emerged a "presumption in today's intelligence set-up that additional data collection rather than improved analysis, will provide the answer to particular intelligence problems".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p.11]&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased collection led to an overabundance of "imperfect" information that began to inundate analysts.  This led to a trend in which collectors began to direct production, resulting a process of collection relevant to the collectors' own interests. Schlesinger referred to the production phase of intelligence as the "stepchild of the community", in which analysts "with a heavy burden of responsibility, find themselves swamped with data" at a time when new hypotheses needed to be tested, particularly regarding the [[USSR]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Organizational dilemmas====
This section of the report outlined one of the primary shortcomings of the IC—the lack of authoritative and directive leadership between IC agencies. The lack of solid leadership stemmed from "the failure of the National Security Act of 1947 to anticipate the 'constitutional' needs of a modern and technologically complex intelligence community".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p.13]&lt;/ref&gt;  Schlesinger's cited the relatively small size and scope of intelligence programs in 1947.  Additionally, in 1947, the Military Services dominated the intelligence community, naturally opposing centralization among non-military services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p.14]&lt;/ref&gt; Schlesinger did, however, point out in this section of the report that the National Security Act of 1947 did say that CIA would "coordinate 'the intelligence activities' of the Government under the direction of the National Security Council".&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Nevertheless, previous DCIs did not fully capitalize on this ascribed authority to coordinate the IC to interact efficiently without major compromises. The office of DCI could not realize its full potential because:
*"As an agency head he bears a number of weighty operational and advisory responsibilities which limit the effort he can devote to community-wide management."
*"He bears a particularly heavy burden for the planning and conduct of covert actions."
*"His multiple roles as community leader, agency head, and intelligence adviser to the President, and to a number of sensitive executive committees, are mutually conflicting."
*"He is a competitor for resources within the community owing to his responsibilities as Director of CIA ([[Director of Central Intelligence|DCI]]), which has large collection programs of its own; thus he cannot be wholly objective in providing guidance for community-wide collection."
*"He controls (redacted) percent of the community's resources and must therefore rely on the persuasion to influence his colleagues regarding the allocation and management of the other (redacted) percent, which is appropriated to the DoD. Since Defense is legally responsible for these very large resources, it feels that it cannot be bound by outside advice on how they should be used."
*"The DCI is outranked by other departmental heads who report directly to the President and are his immediate supervisors on the NSC."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p.15-16]&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on his analysis, Schlesinger points out that that effective reform must address:
*"The leadership of the community as a whole."
*"The direction and control of Defense intelligence activities."
*"The division of functions among the major intelligence agencies."
*"The structuring, staffing, and funding of the processes by which our raw intelligence data are analyzed and interpreted." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p.19]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Specific organizational issues====
Schlesinger described several key specific organizational issues that new policies should address:
*"The power over resources available to the leader of the community."
*"The size and functions of the staff provided to the leader of the community." Considerations should include:
**planning
**control
**"supervision of R&amp;D"
**inspections and reviews of current programs
**"production and dissemination of national estimates"
**"net assessments of US, allied, and opposing capabilities and doctrines"
*"The future role of the United States Intelligence Board ([[USIB]])."
*"Future DoD control over the resources under its jurisdiction."
*"The jurisdiction of either a national leader or a Defense leader over the Military Services."
*"The future functional boundaries of the major intelligence agencies."
*"The number and location of national analytical and estimating centers."
*"The role of the independent review mechanism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p. 20-24]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Leadership of the community====
Schlesinger recommended three options for the new role of community leader:
#Create the position of [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI). The office of the DNI would be responsible for the major collection assets and activities, and would receive a majority of the intelligence budget. The position would oversee the national estimate center.  CIA would continue to be in charge of covert and clandestine services, and DoS and DoD would retain groups at the production level to provide products to their individual leaderships and to contribute to national intelligence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p.25-26]&lt;/ref&gt;
#The second option suggested a modified role of the DCI, dividing the CIA into two groups. One of these divisions would be responsible for production, primarily serving the office of DCI.  The other faction would continue to focus on collection, but it would be led by a new director.  In this capacity, the DCI would be responsible for the intelligence budget and recommendations to the president on behalf of the office of DCI, the modified CIA, and DoD.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/house/intel/ic21/ic21018.html Appendix C. CRS Report: Proposals for Intelligence Reorganization 1949-1996&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
#A third option that Schlesinger suggested would create the position of Coordinator of National Intelligence.  In this capacity, the coordinator would oversee the entire IC from a chiefly managerial perspective, focusing of resources, needs, and evaluate production quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p.25-33]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Department of Defense leadership====
Another critical change recommended by Schlesinger was the need for a single office in charge of all DoD intelligence functions.  He pointed out that, while the [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] had historically been given this responsibility, the lack of staff and resources drastically limited the position's effectiveness. Schlesinger recommended that it would be necessary to either create a [[Director of Defense Intelligence]] in charge of DoD's collection responsibilities, or beef up the existing office of Deputy Secretary of Defense to efficiently handle the Department's intelligence assets and duties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p.34-36]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Changing functional boundaries and costs====
Schlesinger pointed out that the IC budget had been reduced in the last two years (exact figures are classified). In this section, he made several observations regarding the difficulties of budget cuts and restructuring:
*Salary and price increases are likely to offset the perceived budgetary savings.
*IC should anticipate a large increase in research and development costs.
*As the US withdraws from the conflict in Southeast Asia, the IC will be able to reduce SIGINT and HUMINT resources, but the savings would not be significant to meet future demands.
*Sufficient savings may only be attainable by reorganizing the boundaries of military and national intelligence to consolidate resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p.39-43]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schlesinger concluded that, while cutbacks should be pursued, significant budgetary reductions should not be endeavored until reorganization has proven successful.

====Toward improvements in the product====
The report ended with an assessment for improved intelligence production.  Schlesinger pointed out that, while the acquisition of new technologies and collection capabilities was important, the best way to improve the quality of IC output was to focus on making improvements in analysis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But preliminary investigation suggests that higher quality is much more likely to come about within the framework of a coherently organized community which is focused on improving output rather than input.  Indeed, it seems a fair assumption that the President would be willing to rebate some of the potential savings from the community if he had any hope of improved performance as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p.44]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The report listed several general steps that may be taken to improve analysis and production:
*Increase consumer representation and better communication of needs
*Provide for internal product evaluation sections within the individual organizations
*Improve the existing analytical centers, making DIA competitive with CIA
*Conduct external reviews of hypotheses and analytical methods
*Establish a national assessment group to check validate hypotheses
*Create stronger incentives for well-trained analysts and improve personnel resources
*Focus resources toward learning new methods of analysis and estimation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p.45-45]&lt;/ref&gt;

His conclusion, however, conceded that it was difficult at present time to determine the specific changes to be made regarding improved analysis, but reiterated that this should be the top priority of the new leadership once reorganization has been conducted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB144/document%204.pdf A Review of the Intelligence Community, March 10, 1971. p.46]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Staging the World catalogue cover.jpg|thumb|right|The exhibition's catalogue.]]
'''Shakespeare: Staging the World''' was an exhibition at the [[British Museum]] about the world of Shakespeare, showing the way that he portrayed the world in his plays and related it to the events and politics of contemporary London.  It was produced as part of the [[World Shakespeare Festival]] and ran from 19 July to 25 November 2012.

==Reception==
The exhibition was well received by the critics and press.  [[Katherine Duncan-Jones]] wrote, "...the exhibition has something for everyone, and deserves more than one visit."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The world Shakespeare festival – authentic or eccentric? |author=Katherine Duncan-Jones |date=8 August 2012 |journal=[[Times Literary Supplement]] |url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1099143.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] wrote, "What I like about the exhibition is that so many of the artefacts, including paintings, maps, globes, domestic objects and military weapons, relate to specific images in Shakespeare's plays. ... It's a brilliant exhibition ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/19/shakespeare-staging-the-world-review |title=Shakespeare: Staging the World – review |journal=[[The Guardian]] |author=Michael Billington |date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book accompanying the exhibition, by the Shakespeare scholar [[Jonathan Bate]] and [[Dora Thornton]], Renaissance curator at the museum, was especially praised.  Richard Dorment, theatre critic of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', wrote, "The catalogue by Bate and Thornton is well worth reading for its own sake, and once you start you won’t be able to stop."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/william-shakespeare/9404131/Shakespeare-Staging-the-World-review.html |title=Shakespeare: Staging the World, review |journal=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | author=Richard Dorment |date=16 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Brian Sewell]] wrote, "... the catalogue should be in every school library in the land.  ... every student of English literature should have his own copy and that the book should never go out of print."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/arts/visual-arts/brian-sewell-on-shakespeare-staging-the-world-british-museum-7978471.html |title=Brian Sewell on Shakespeare: Staging the World, British Museum |journal=[[Evening Standard]] |date=26 July 2012 |author=Brian Sewell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objects==
The objects exhibited included: the [[Blacas Cameo]], the [[Dunstable Swan Jewel]], [[Royal Gold Cup]], [[Brooch of Lorn]], and the [[Quentin Metsys the Younger|Metsys]] Siena [[Portraiture of Elizabeth I of England#The Virgin Queen|''Sieve Portrait of Elizabeth I'']].

The Tampa Bay History Center includes three floors of permanent and temporary exhibition space covering 12,000 years of Florida history, with a special focus on [[Tampa Bay]] and the [[Gulf Coast]].

The History Center is one of the largest on the west coast of Florida and includes hands-on, kid-friendly activities, as well as cutting edge interactive exhibits and theaters.

The Tampa Bay History Center is open daily from 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. until 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Regular admission is $12.95 for adults, $10.95 for students, seniors and children between the ages of 13 and 17, and $7.00 for children ages four to twelve.

==Tampa Bay History Center timeline==
Hillsborough County was 14 times its present size when it was established by the Florida Territorial Legislature in 1834. Its boundaries included all or part of 24 
present-day counties, stretching from Ocala to Lake Okeechobee and St. Petersburg to Orlando.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of Historical County Boundaries, Long, John H.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1880s, Tampa residents expressed concern that there was no organized effort to preserve and display local artifacts. In the January 19, 1882, issue of [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83016264/ The Sunland Tribune], County Judge J. G. Knapp wrote, "... no time should be lost in snatching the historical artifacts from the waste and death of oblivion. Who shall do it?"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4005">The '''Gold-spinners''' ({{lang-et|Kullaketrajad}}) is an Estonian [[fairy tale]] collected by Dr. [[Friedrich Kreutzwald]] in ''Eestirahwa Ennemuistesed jutud''.  [[W. F. Kirby]] included it in ''The Hero of Esthonia'', and [[Andrew Lang]], under the title '''The Water-lily. The Gold Spinners''', in ''[[The Blue Fairy Book]]''.

==Synopsis==
In a hut hidden deep in a forest, three beautiful maidens spend each waking moment weaving gold flax into yarn. A cruel older woman supervises them, collecting every finished thread. She leaves them only for short journeys - always leaving a full slate of work along with the warning to keep their eyes on their work, and to speak to no man; otherwise the gold will lose its shine and great misfortunes will follow.

During one of her absences, a Prince is separated from his hunting party, and wandering in the forest, comes across the hut. The elder maidens hide from him, but the youngest seeks out his company. Days later, when the King's search party finds the hut, the Prince and maiden sit before it lost in conversation. The Prince promises to return for the maiden, who sits to work her neglected wheel. Sure enough, the bright thread is dull now, just as the woman had predicted. Terrified, she is convinced that misfortunes will now come. Soon enough, the woman comes and with one glance at the tarnished thread knows everything. The youngest maiden manages to send a message to her Prince through a raven. The Prince comes to her and carries her off.

The woman is enraged and, as she is a wicked [[witch]], promptly casts a spell. She conjures a magic ball, which flies by the maiden as she is held by the mounted Prince crossing a bridge.  Whirlwinds cast her from the Prince's arms and into the river. Though he tries to dive in after her, he is restrained by his men. A year later, visiting the spot, he sees a yellow water lily in the river and hears a voice sing a forlorn song about being bewitched and forsaken. He goes on through the forest to the hut and consults the gold-spinners, who insist that the flower must be their sister. He sleeps the night in the hut, having a magic cake for his dinner secretly prepared by the eldest sister. In the morning, as he rides off, he understands the [[language of the birds]]. In this way he learns that the Wizard of Finland can help him, and through the birds,  contacts him. The wizard, in the form of an eagle, instructs him to stand on the river bank, smeared with mud, and say "From a man into a crab". Once he becomes a crab, he is to swim to the flower, cut its roots, and rise with the lily to the surface. Drifting with the current, he is to ascend a large stone, say "From a crab into a man, from a water-lily into a maiden" and so save the maiden.

He does all of these things and the maiden is restored, more beautiful than ever and dressed in magnificent robes and jewels. Now, although to the Prince only hours had passed in fulfilling his mission, actually 10 days had gone by and the King and Queen were at church, weeping for their dead son. The Prince and maiden arrive and are married on the spot. In their happiness, the Prince forgets his promise to the Wizard, to free the two maidens. A crow berates them, how could they forget the sisters. Chagrined, the Prince rescues the pair. The eldest makes up a poisoned cake, which the witch eats on her return and dies. The Prince and his bride and her sisters live quite happily, recovering 50 wagonloads of the gold thread that had been hidden away by the witch.

'''''The Wizard of Oz''''' is a 1939 American [[Musical film|musical]] [[fantasy film]] produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Widely considered to be one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films in cinema history]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/100Years/movies.aspx|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|website=www.afi.com|access-date=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the best-known and most commercially successful adaptation of [[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1900 children's book ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]].&lt;ref name="Fricke"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History|last=Fricke|first=John|publisher=Warner Books|year=1989|isbn=0-446-51446-2|location=New York|authorlink=John Fricke}}&lt;/ref&gt;''  It was directed primarily by [[Victor Fleming]] (who left production to take over direction on the troubled ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' production). It stars [[Judy Garland]] as [[Dorothy Gale]], alongside [[Ray Bolger]], [[Jack Haley]], [[Bert Lahr]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Billie Burke]], and [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]], with [[Charley Grapewin]], [[Pat Walshe]], and [[Clara Blandick]], [[Terry (dog)|Terry]] (billed as Toto), and [[Leo Singer|Singer's Midgets]] as the [[Munchkin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Note: All actors share equal billing; Singer's Midgets are listed in the credits as "The Munchkins".&lt;/ref&gt;

Legendary for its use of [[Technicolor]], fantasy storytelling, musical score and memorable characters, the film has become an icon of American popular culture. It was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], but lost to ''Gone with the Wind''. It did win in two other categories: [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for "[[Over the Rainbow]]" and [[12th Academy Awards|Best Original Score]] by [[Herbert Stothart]]. While the film was considered a critical success upon release in August 1939, it failed to make a profit for MGM until the 1949 re-release, earning only $3,017,000 on a $2,777,000 budget, not including promotional costs, which made it MGM's most expensive production at that time.&lt;ref name="Mannix" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Frank S. | last=Nugent |date=August 18, 1939 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review |title=The Screen in Review; 'The Wizard of Oz,' Produced by the Wizards of Hollywood, Works Its Magic on the Capitol's Screen – March of Time Features New York at the Music Hall at the Palace |accessdate=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Susan|title=How did 'Wizard of Oz' fare on its 1939 release?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/11/entertainment/la-et-mn-original-wizard-reaction-20130311|accessdate=April 24, 2015|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The Wizard of Oz on television|1956 television broadcast premiere of the film]] on the [[CBS]] network reintroduced the film to the public; watching it became an annual tradition and, according to the Library of Congress, it is the most seen film in movie history.&lt;ref name="Fricke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/oz/ozsect2.html |title=To See The Wizard Oz on Stage and Film |date=December 15, 2010 |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was among the first 25 films that inaugurated the [[National Film Registry]] list in 1989.&lt;ref name="registrylist1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/complete-national-recording-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Recording Registry Listing  – Recording Registry  – National Recording Preservation Board  – Programs at the Library of Congress  – Library of Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the few films on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme#Memory of the World Register|Memory of the World Register]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming 1939), produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer | url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22303&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090805040156/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D22303%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html | dead-url= yes | archive-date= August 5, 2009 | publisher= UNESCO Memory of the World Programme | accessdate= September 7, 2009 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is among the top ten in the [[BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14]].

''The Wizard of Oz'' is the source of many quotes referenced in contemporary [[popular culture]]. [[Noel Langley]], [[Florence Ryerson]], and [[Edgar Allan Woolf]] received credit for the screenplay, but uncredited contributions were made by others. The songs were written by [[Yip Harburg|Edgar "Yip" Harburg]] (lyrics) and [[Harold Arlen]] (music). The musical score and the incidental music were composed by Stothart.

&lt;!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots are between 400 and 700 words.--&gt;
[[Dorothy Gale]] lives with her [[Cairn Terrier]] dog [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] on the [[Kansas]] farm of her [[Aunt Em]] and [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]]. Toto bites witchy neighbor [[Miss Almira Gulch]], who then obtains an order for Toto to be [[euthanized]]. She takes Toto away on her bicycle, but he escapes and returns to Dorothy, who decides to run away from home to save her dog.

They meet [[Professor Marvel]], a kindly fortune teller who uses his crystal ball to make Dorothy believe that Aunt Em may be dying of a broken heart. Dorothy races home, arriving just as a powerful [[tornado]] strikes. Locked out of the farm's [[storm cellar]], she seeks shelter in her bedroom. Wind-blown debris knocks her unconscious and the house is sent spinning in the air. She awakens to see various figures fly by, including Miss Gulch, who transforms into a witch on a broomstick.

[[File:Billie Burke and Judy Garland The Wizard of Oz (1939).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Dorothy with Glinda, the Good Witch of the North]]

The house lands in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]] in the [[Land of Oz]]. [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good Witch of the North]] and the [[Munchkin]]s welcome her as a heroine, as the falling house has killed the [[Wicked Witch of the East]]; only the witch's legs and the [[ruby slippers]] on her feet are visible. Her sister, the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], arrives to claim the slippers, but Glinda transports them onto Dorothy's feet first. The Wicked Witch of the West swears revenge on Dorothy for her sister's death, then vanishes. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the [[yellow brick road]] to the [[Emerald City]], where she can ask the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] to help her get back home.

On her journey Dorothy meets the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], who wants a brain; the [[Tin Woodman]], who desires a heart; and the [[Cowardly Lion]], who needs courage. Dorothy invites them to accompany her to the Emerald City, where they can ask the Wizard to help them too. Despite harassment from the Witch they reach the Emerald City and are eventually permitted to see the Wizard, who appears as a large ghostly head surrounded by fire and smoke. He agrees to grant their wishes if they prove their worth by bringing him the Witch's broomstick.

As the four (plus Toto) make their way to the Witch's castle, the Witch sends her [[winged monkeys]] to capture Dorothy and Toto. At the castle, the Witch realizes that Dorothy must be dead before the ruby slippers can be removed. Toto escapes and leads her three friends to the castle. They ambush three guards, don the guards' uniforms, and march inside to locate Dorothy. The Witch and her guards chase them through the castle and surround them. When the Witch sets fire to the Scarecrow, Dorothy tosses a bucket of water at him; water also splashes the Witch, who melts away. The guards rejoice and give Dorothy the broomstick.

[[File:The Wizard of Oz Ray Bolger 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Bolger as the scarecrow]]

Back in the Emerald City, as the Wizard stalls in fulfilling his promises Toto pulls back a curtain and exposes the "Wizard" as a middle-aged man speaking through a microphone. He denies Dorothy's accusation that he is a bad man, but admits to being a [[humbug]]. He then gives the Scarecrow a diploma, the Lion a medal, and the Tin Man a ticking heart-shaped watch, helping them see that the attributes they sought (brains, heart, courage) were already within them. He then offers to take Dorothy and Toto home in his [[hot air balloon]].

As Dorothy and the Wizard prepare to depart, Toto jumps off and Dorothy goes to catch him, so the balloon leaves with only the Wizard. Glinda appears and tells Dorothy that the Ruby Slippers will take her home. Following Glinda's instructions, Dorothy taps her heels together three times and repeats, "There's no place like home".

Dorothy wakes up in Kansas surrounded by her family and friends. Everyone dismisses her adventure as a dream, but Dorothy insists it was real, and says she has learned there is no place like home.

==Production==

===Development and pre-production===
[[File:Wizard title page.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Interior title plate of ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'', the popular 1900 novel by L. Frank Baum]]
Development began when [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937) showed that films adapted from popular children's stories and fairytale folklore could be successful.&lt;ref name="Fricke2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History |last=Fricke |first=John |authorlink=John Fricke |last2=Scarfone |first2=Jay |last3=Stillman |first3=William |year=1986 |publisher=Warner Books, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-446-51446-2 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheMakingOfAMovieClassic" /&gt; In January 1938, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] bought the rights to L. Frank Baum’s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|hugely popular novel]] from [[Samuel Goldwyn]], who had toyed with the idea of making the film as a vehicle for [[Eddie Cantor]], who was under contract to the Goldwyn studios and whom Goldwyn wanted to cast as the Scarecrow.&lt;ref name="TheMakingOfAMovieClassic" /&gt;

The script went through a number of writers and revisions before the final shooting.&lt;ref name="Harmetz" /&gt; [[Mervyn LeRoy]]'s assistant William H. Cannon had submitted a brief four-page outline.&lt;ref name="Harmetz" /&gt; Because recent fantasy films had not fared well, he recommended that the magical elements of the story be toned down or eliminated. In his outline, the Scarecrow was a man so stupid that the only employment open to him was literally scaring crows from cornfields, and the Tin Woodman was a criminal so heartless he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity; this torture softened him into someone gentle and kind.&lt;ref name="Harmetz" /&gt; His vision was similar to [[Larry Semon]]'s [[Wizard of Oz (1925 film)|1925 film adaptation]] of the story, in which the magical element is absent.

After that, LeRoy hired screenwriter [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]], who soon delivered a 17-page draft of the Kansas scenes, and a few weeks later, a further 56 pages. [[Noel Langley]] and poet [[Ogden Nash]] were also hired to write separate versions of the story. None of these three knew about the others, and this was not an uncommon procedure. Nash delivered a four-page outline, Langley turned in a 43-page treatment and a full film script. He{{who|date=August 2017}} turned in three more, this time incorporating the songs that had been written by [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Yip Harburg]]. [[Florence Ryerson]] and [[Edgar Allan Woolf]] submitted a script and were brought on board to touch up the writing. They would be responsible for making sure the story stayed true to the Baum book. However, producer [[Arthur Freed]] was unhappy with their work and reassigned it to Langley.&lt;ref name=Coan&gt;{{cite news|last=Coan|first=Stephen|title=KZN's very own screen wizard|url=http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&amp;global%5B_id%5D=73897|accessdate=April 24, 2014|newspaper=The Witness|date=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During filming, [[Victor Fleming]] and [[John Lee Mahin]] revised the script further, adding and cutting some scenes. In addition, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr are known to have written some of their own dialogue for the Kansas sequence.



The final draft of the script was completed on October 8, 1938, following numerous rewrites.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewizardofoz.warnerbros.com/movie/cmp/timeline.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907233032/http://thewizardofoz.warnerbros.com/movie/cmp/timeline.html |archivedate=September 7, 2007 |title=Wizard of Oz Timeline |accessdate=September 10, 2007 |publisher=Warnerbros.com |author=Warner Bros }}&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, it was a mish-mash of many creative minds, but Langley, Ryerson, and Woolf got the film credits. Along with the contributors already mentioned, others who assisted with the adaptation without receiving credit include: [[Irving Brecher]], [[Herbert Fields]], Arthur Freed, Yip Harburg, [[Samuel Hoffenstein]], Jack Mintz, Sid Silvers, [[Richard Thorpe]], Cukor and Vidor.&lt;ref name="TheMakingOfAMovieClassic" /&gt;

In addition, songwriter Harburg's son (and biographer) Ernie Harburg reported:&lt;ref name="democracynow.org"&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/25/0832252 Democracy Now. November 25, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114223630/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04%2F11%2F25%2F0832252 |date=November 14, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|So anyhow, Yip also wrote all the dialogue in that time and the setup to the songs and he also wrote the part where they give out the heart, the brains, and the nerve, because he was the final script editor. And he – there was eleven screenwriters on that – and he pulled the whole thing together, wrote his own lines and gave the thing a coherence and unity which made it a work of art. But he doesn't get credit for that. He gets lyrics by E. Y. Harburg, you see. But nevertheless, he put his influence on the thing.}}

The original producers thought that a 1939 audience was too sophisticated to accept Oz as a straight-ahead fantasy; therefore, it was reconceived as a lengthy, elaborate [[dream sequence]]. Because of a perceived need to attract a youthful audience through appealing to modern fads and styles, the score had featured a song called "[[The Jitterbug]]", and the script had featured a scene with a series of musical contests. A spoiled, selfish princess in Oz had outlawed all forms of music except classical and [[operetta]], and went up against Dorothy in a singing contest in which her swing style enchanted listeners and won the grand prize. This part was initially written for [[Betty Jaynes (actress)|Betty Jaynes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Fordin | first = Hugh | title = World of Entertainment | publisher = Avon Books (Mm) | location = City | year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0-380-00754-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was later dropped.

Another scene, which was removed before final script approval and never filmed, was a concluding scene back in Kansas after Dorothy's return. Hunk (the Kansan counterpart to the Scarecrow) is leaving for agricultural college and extracts a promise from Dorothy to write to him. The implication of the scene is that romance will eventually develop between the two, which also may have been intended as an explanation for Dorothy's partiality for the Scarecrow over her other two companions. This plot idea was never totally dropped, but is especially noticeable in the final script when Dorothy, just before she is to leave Oz, tells the Scarecrow, "I think I'll miss you most of all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001433010|title=Hollywood Reporter, Oct.&amp;nbsp;20, 2005 }} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'', Baum describes Kansas as being "in shades of gray". Further, Dorothy lived inside a farmhouse which had its paint blistered and washed away by the weather, giving it an air of grayness. The house and property were situated in the middle of a sweeping prairie where the grass was burnt gray by harsh sun. Aunt Em and Uncle Henry were "gray with age". Effectively, the use of monochrome sepia tones for the Kansas sequences was a stylistic choice that evoked the dull and gray countryside.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Much attention was given to the use of color in the production, with the MGM production crew favoring some hues over others. Consequently, it took the studio's art department almost a week to settle on the final shade of yellow used for the yellow brick road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Gerald |year=2001 |title=Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland |publisher=Delta |isbn=0-385-33515-6 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting=== 
[[File:The Wizard of Oz Judy Garland 1939.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|Garland won the role of Dorothy despite substantial competition.]]
{{See also|Munchkin#In the 1939 film}}

LeRoy had always insisted that he wanted to cast [[Judy Garland]] to play Dorothy from the start; however, evidence suggests that negotiations occurred early in pre-production for [[Shirley Temple]] to be cast as Dorothy, on loan from [[20th Century Fox]]. A persistent rumor also existed that Fox, in turn, was promised [[Clark Gable]] and [[Jean Harlow]] as a loan from MGM. The tale is almost certainly untrue, as Harlow died in 1937, before MGM had even purchased the rights to the story. Despite this, the story appears in many film biographies (including Temple's own autobiography). The documentary ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic'' states that Mervyn LeRoy was under pressure to cast Temple, then the most popular child star, but at an unofficial audition, MGM musical mainstay [[Roger Edens]] listened to her sing and felt that an actress with a different style was needed; a 50th anniversary documentary for the film suggested that Temple, then 10-years-old, was slightly too young for the part. Newsreel footage is included in which Temple wisecracks, "There's no place like home", suggesting that she was being considered for the part at that time.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Making of a Movie Classic''. CBS Television, 1990, narrated by Angela Lansbury. Co-produced by John Fricke and [[Aljean Harmetz]].&lt;/ref&gt; A possibility is that this consideration did indeed take place, but that Gable and Harlow were not part of the proposed deal.

Actress [[Deanna Durbin]], who was under contract to [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]], was also considered for the part of Dorothy. Durbin, at the time, far exceeded Garland in film experience and fan base and both had co-starred in a 1936 [[short film|two-reeler]] titled ''[[Every Sunday]]''. The film was most notable for exhibiting Durbin's operatic style of singing against Garland's jazzier style. Durbin was possibly passed over once it was decided to bring on Jaynes, also an operatic singer, to rival Garland's jazz in the aforementioned discarded subplot of the film.

[[File:Buddy Ebsen Tin Man.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Ebsen's first makeup test as the Tin Man]]
[[Ray Bolger]] was originally cast as the Tin Man and [[Buddy Ebsen]] was to play the Scarecrow.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; Bolger, however, longed to play the Scarecrow, as his childhood idol [[Fred Stone]] had done [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 musical)|on stage in 1902]]; with that very performance, Stone had inspired him to become a vaudevillian in the first place. Now unhappy with his role as the Tin Man (reportedly claiming, "I'm not a tin performer; I'm fluid"), Bolger convinced producer Mervyn LeRoy to recast him in the part he so desired.&lt;ref name="cemeteryguide.com"&gt;[http://www.cemeteryguide.com/bolger.html Cemetery Guide, ''Hollywood Remains to Be Seen'', Mark Masek].&lt;/ref&gt; Ebsen did not object; after going over the basics of the Scarecrow's distinctive gait with Bolger (as a professional dancer, Ebsen had been cast because the studio was confident he would be up to the task of replicating the famous "wobbly-walk" of Stone's Scarecrow), he recorded all of his songs, went through all the rehearsals as the Tin Man and began filming with the rest of the cast.&lt;ref&gt;Fricke, John and Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bert Lahr]] was signed for the Cowardly Lion on July 25, 1938; the next month, [[Charles Grapewin]] was cast as Uncle Henry on August 12.

[[W. C. Fields]] was originally chosen for the role of the Wizard, a role turned down by [[Ed Wynn]] as he thought the part was too small, but the studio ran out of patience after protracted haggling over Fields' fee; instead, another contract player, [[Frank Morgan]], was cast on September 22.

An extensive talent search produced over a hundred little people to play Munchkins; this meant that most of the film's Oz sequences would have to already be shot before work on the Munchkinland sequence could begin. According to Munchkin actor [[Jerry Maren]], the little people were each paid over $125 a week (equivalent to ${{Inflation|index=US|value=125|start_year=1938|r=-2|fmt=c}} today). [[Meinhardt Raabe]], who played the coroner, revealed in the 1990 documentary ''The Making of the Wizard of Oz'' that the MGM costume and wardrobe department, under the direction of designer [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], had to design over 100 costumes for the Munchkin sequences. They then had to photograph and catalog each Munchkin in his or her costume so that they could correctly apply the same costume and makeup each day of production.

[[Gale Sondergaard]] was originally cast as the Wicked Witch. She became unhappy when the witch's persona shifted from sly and glamorous (thought to emulate the wicked queen in Disney's ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'') into the familiar "ugly hag". She turned down the role and was replaced on October 10, 1938, just three days before filming started, by MGM contract player [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]. Sondergaard said in an interview for a bonus feature on the [[DVD]] that she had no regrets about turning down the part, and would go on to play a glamorous villain in Fox's version of [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[The Blue Bird (1940 film)|The Blue Bird]]'' in 1940; Margaret Hamilton played a role remarkably similar to the Wicked Witch in the Judy Garland film ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'' (1939).

According to Aljean Harmetz, the "gone-to-seed" coat worn by Morgan as the wizard was selected from a rack of coats purchased from a second-hand shop. According to legend, Morgan later discovered a label in the coat indicating it had once belonged to Baum, that Baum's widow confirmed this, and that the coat was eventually presented to her. But Baum biographer [[Michael Patrick Hearn]] says the Baum family denies ever seeing the coat or knowing of the story; Hamilton considered it a concocted studio rumor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Patrick Hearn|Hearn, Michael Patrick]].

===Filming===

====Richard Thorpe as director====
Filming commenced October 13, 1938, on the [[Sony Pictures Studios|MGM lot]] in [[Culver City, California]], under the direction of [[Richard Thorpe]] (replacing original director [[Norman Taurog]], who filmed only a few early Technicolor tests and was then reassigned). Thorpe initially shot about two weeks of footage (nine days in total) involving Dorothy's first encounter with the Scarecrow, as well as a number of sequences in the Wicked Witch's castle, such as Dorothy's rescue (which, though unreleased, comprises the only footage of Ebsen's Tin Man).

====Ebsen replaced by Haley====

According to most sources, ten days into the shoot, Ebsen suffered a reaction to the aluminum powder makeup he wore. He was hospitalized in critical condition, and subsequently was forced to leave the project; in a later interview (included on the 2005 DVD release of ''The Wizard of Oz''), he recalled the studio heads appreciated the seriousness of his illness only after seeing him in the hospital. Filming halted while a replacement for him was found. No full footage of him as the Tin Man has ever been released{{snd}}only photographs taken during filming and makeup test photos. His replacement, [[Jack Haley]], simply assumed he had been fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Smalling | first = Allen |authorlink=| title = The Making of the Wizard of Oz: Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM | publisher = Hyperion | location =| year = 1989 | isbn = 0-7868-8352-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and screen-writer [[George MacDonald Fraser]] offers an alternative story, told to him by [[Burt Lancaster]]'s producing partner, Jim Hill, that Ebsen had refused to be painted silver and was fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = MacDonald Fraser | first = George |authorlink=| title = The Light's on at Signpost | publisher = Harper-Collins | location =| year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-00-732563-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====George Cukor's brief stint====
LeRoy, after reviewing the footage and feeling Thorpe was rushing the production, adversely affecting the actors' performances, had Thorpe replaced. During reorganization on the production, [[George Cukor]] temporarily took over, under LeRoy's guidance. Initially, the studio had made Garland wear a blond wig and heavy "baby-doll" makeup, and she played Dorothy in an exaggerated fashion; now, Cukor changed Garland's and Hamilton's makeup and costumes, and told Garland to "be herself". This meant that all the scenes Garland and Hamilton had already completed had to be discarded and reshot. Cukor also suggested that the studio cast Jack Haley, on loan from Fox, as the Tin Man. To keep down on production costs, Haley only rerecorded "If I Only Had a Heart" and solo lines during "The Jitterbug" and "If I Only Had the Nerve"; as such, Ebsen's voice can still be heard in the remaining songs featuring the Tin Man in group vocals. The makeup used for Haley was quietly changed to an aluminum paste, with a layer of clown white greasepaint underneath to protect his skin; although it did not have the same dire effect on Haley, he did at one point suffer an eye infection from it.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In addition, Bolger's original recording of "[[If I Only Had a Brain]]" had been far more sedate compared to the version heard in the film; during this time, Cukor and LeRoy decided that a more energetic rendition would better suit Dorothy's initial meeting with the Scarecrow (initially, it was to contrast with his lively manner in Thorpe's footage), and was rerecorded as such. At first thought to be lost for over seven decades, a recording of this original version was rediscovered in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejudyroom.com/news-oz.html#brain The Wizard of Oz 70th Anniversary News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513210807/http://www.thejudyroom.com/news-oz.html#brain |date=May 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Victor Fleming, the main director====
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Victor Fleming 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Director Victor Fleming]] --&gt;

Cukor did not actually shoot any scenes for the film, merely acting as something of a "creative advisor" to the troubled production, and, because of his prior commitment to direct ''Gone with the Wind'', he left on November 3, 1938, when [[Victor Fleming]] assumed directorial responsibility. As director, Fleming chose not to shift the film from Cukor's creative realignment, as producer LeRoy had already pronounced his satisfaction with the new course the film was taking.

Production on the bulk of the Technicolor sequences was a long and exhausting process that ran for over six months, from October 1938 to March 1939. Most of the cast worked six days a week and had to arrive as early as 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to be fitted with makeup and costumes, and often did not leave until 7 pm or later. Cumbersome makeup and costumes were made even more uncomfortable by the daylight-bright lighting the early Technicolor process required, which could heat the set to over 100&amp;nbsp;°F (38&amp;nbsp;°C). Bolger later said that the frightening nature of the costumes prevented most of the Oz principals from eating in the studio commissary;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Interview of [[Ray Bolger]]|title=The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic|publisher=Jack Haley Jr Productions|date=1990|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the toxicity of Hamilton's copper-based makeup forced her to eat a liquid diet on shoot days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leopold|first1=Ted|title='The Wizard of Oz' at 75: Did you know...?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/25/showbiz/the-wizard-of-oz-75th-anniversary/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=September 1, 2017|date=August 25, 2014|quote=Margaret Hamilton's copper-based makeup as the Wicked Witch was poisonous, so she lived on a liquid diet during the film, and the makeup was carefully cleaned off her each day.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took as many as twelve takes to have Toto run alongside the actors as they skipped down the yellow brick road.

All of the Oz sequences were filmed in three-strip Technicolor.&lt;ref name="TheMakingOfAMovieClassic"&gt;''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Making of a Movie Classic'' (1990). CBS Television, narrated by Angela Lansbury. Co-produced by John Fricke and Aljean Harmetz.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmetz"&gt;Aljean Harmetz (2004). ''The Making of The Wizard of Oz''.

In Hamilton's exit from Munchkinland, a concealed elevator was arranged to lower her below stage as fire and smoke erupted to dramatize and conceal her exit. The first take ran well but in the second take the flames did not go out in time. The flames set fire to her green, copper-based face paint, causing third-degree burns on her hands and face. She spent three months healing before returning to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Movie Musicals|last=Aylesworth|first=Thomas|publisher=Gallery Books|year=1984|isbn=0-8317-4467-7|location=New York City|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====King Vidor's finishing work as director====
On February 12, 1939, Fleming hastily replaced Cukor in directing ''Gone with the Wind''; the next day, [[King Vidor]] was assigned as director by the studio to finish the filming of ''The Wizard of Oz'' (mainly the sepia-toned Kansas sequences, including Garland's singing of "[[Over the Rainbow]]" and the tornado). In later years, when the film became firmly established as a classic, Vidor chose not to take public credit for his contribution until after the death of his friend Fleming in 1949.

===Post-production===
[[Principal photography]] concluded with the Kansas sequences on March 16, 1939; nonetheless, reshoots and pick-up shots were filmed throughout April and May and into June, under the direction of producer LeRoy. After the deletion of the "Over the Rainbow" reprise during subsequent test screenings in early June, Garland had to be brought back one more time to reshoot the "Auntie Em, I'm frightened!" scene without the song; the footage of Blandick's Aunt Em, as shot by Vidor, had already been set aside for rear-projection work, and was simply reused.

After Hamilton's torturous experience with the Munchkinland elevator, she refused to do the pick-ups for the scene in which she flies on a broomstick that billows smoke, so LeRoy chose to have stand-in Betty Danko perform the scene, instead; as a result, Danko was severely injured doing the scene due to a malfunction in the smoke mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of the Wizard of Oz – Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM – and the Miracle of Production #1060'', 10th Edition, Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc./Random House, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, the film began a long arduous post-production. [[Herbert Stothart]] had to compose the film's background score, while [[A. Arnold Gillespie]] had to perfect the various special effects that the film required, including many of the rear projection shots. The MGM art department also had to create the various matte paintings for the background of many of the scenes.

One significant innovation planned for the film was the use of stencil printing for the transition to Technicolor. Each frame was to be hand-tinted to maintain the sepia tone; however, because this was too expensive and labor-intensive, it was abandoned and MGM used a simpler and less expensive variation of the process. During the reshoots in May, the inside of the farm house was painted sepia, and when Dorothy opens the door, it is not Garland, but her stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, wearing a sepia gingham dress, who then backs out of frame; once the camera moves through the door, Garland steps back into frame in her bright blue gingham dress (as noted in DVD extras), and the sepia-painted door briefly tints her with the same color before she emerges from the house's shadow, into the bright glare of the Technicolor lighting. This also meant that the reshoots provided the first proper shot of Munchkinland; if one looks carefully, the brief cut to Dorothy looking around outside the house bisects a single long shot, from the inside of the doorway to the pan-around that finally ends in a reverse-angle as the ruins of the house are seen behind Dorothy as she comes to a stop at the foot of the small bridge.

[[Test screening]]s of the film began on June 5, 1939.&lt;ref name="geo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114114015/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|archivedate=November 14, 2007|title="The Wizard of Oz"...&amp;nbsp;A Movie Timeline|accessdate=September 10, 2007|publisher=geocities.com|author=Jim's "Wizard of Oz" Website Directory}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oz'' initially ran nearly two hours long. LeRoy and Fleming knew that at least 15 minutes needed to be deleted to get the film down to a manageable running time; the average film in 1939 ran for just about 90 minutes. Three sneak previews in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] and [[San Luis Obispo, California]], helped guide LeRoy and Fleming in the cutting. Among the many cuts were "The Jitterbug" number, the Scarecrow's elaborate dance sequence following "If I Only Had a Brain", reprises of "Over the Rainbow" and "[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]", and a number of smaller dialogue sequences. This left the final, mostly serious portion of the film with no songs, only the dramatic underscoring.

One song that was almost deleted was "Over the Rainbow". MGM had felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long, as well as being far over the heads of the target audience of children. The studio also thought that it was degrading for Garland to sing in a barnyard. LeRoy, uncredited associate producer Arthur Freed and director Fleming fought to keep it in, and they all eventually won. The song went on to win the [[Academy Award]] for Best Song of the Year, and came to be identified so strongly with Garland herself that she made it her theme song.

After the preview in San Luis Obispo in early July, the film was officially released in August 1939 at its current 101-minute running time.

===Special effects, makeup and costumes===
[[A. Arnold Gillespie|Arnold Gillespie]] was the [[special effect]]s director for the film. The [[tornado]] scene was especially costly. Gillespie used [[muslin]] cloth to make the tornado flexible after a previous attempt with [[rubber]] failed. He hung the 35 feet of muslin to a steel [[gantry crane|gantry]] and connected the bottom to a rod. By moving the gantry and rod, he was able to create the illusion of a tornado moving across the stage. [[Fuller's Earth]] was sprayed from both the top and bottom using compressed air hoses to complete the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = It’s a twister! 75 years later, Wizard of Oz is still a tornado classic| work = [[Washington Post]]| accessdate = August 23, 2018| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2014/08/15/its-a-twister-75-years-later-wizard-of-oz-is-still-a-tornado-classic/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow masks were made of [[foam latex]] makeup made by makeup artist [[Jack Dawn]], who was one of the first makeup artists to use this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Twenty-First Century Books| isbn = 978-0-7613-2918-3| last = Miller| first = Ron| title = Special Effects: An Introduction to Movie Magic| date = January 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn = 978-1-4803-9719-4| last = Hogan| first = David J.| title = The Wizard of Oz FAQ: All That's Left to Know About Life, According to Oz| date = June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor who played Scarecrow was left with permanent lines around his mouth and chin from his mask.

==Music==
{{Main|Musical selections in The Wizard of Oz}}
[[File:Vc41.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Herbert Stothart conducts the MGM Studio Orchestra for ''The Wizard of Oz'', which was recorded at the MGM studios.]]
The film is widely noted for its musical selections and soundtrack. The music was composed by [[Harold Arlen]], and the lyrics were written by [[Yip Harburg]], both of whom won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for "Over the Rainbow". The song was ranked first in two lists: the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s "[[Songs of the Century|365 Songs of the Century]]".

MGM composer [[Herbert Stothart]], a well-known Hollywood composer and songwriter, won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] in recognition of his original score.

[[Georgie Stoll]] was associate conductor and screen credit was given to [[George Bassman]], [[Murray Cutter]], [[Ken Darby]] and Paul Marquardt for orchestral and vocal arrangements (as usual, Roger Edens was also heavily involved as an unbilled musical associate to Freed.)

The songs were recorded in the studio's scoring stage before filming. Several of the recordings were completed while Ebsen was still with the cast. Therefore, while he had to be dropped from the cast due to illness from the aluminum powder makeup, his singing voice remained in the soundtrack (as noted in the notes for the CD Deluxe Edition). In the group vocals of "We're Off to See the Wizard", his voice can be heard. Haley spoke with a distinct [[Boston accent]], thus did not pronounce the ''r'' in ''wizard''. By contrast, Ebsen was a [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]erner, like Garland, and pronounced it. Haley rerecorded Ebsen's solo parts later.

===Deleted songs===
[[File:Wizard of Oz lobby card.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Lobby card with still of deleted musical number "Hail! Hail! The Witch is Dead!", sung upon the return to the Emerald City]]
Some musical pieces filmed were deleted in the editing process.

The song "The Jitterbug", written in a swing style, was intended for the sequence in which the group is journeying to the Witch's castle. Due to time constraints, the song was cut from the final theatrical version. The film footage for the song has been lost, although silent home film footage of rehearsals for the number has survived. The sound recording for the song, however, is intact and was included in the two-CD [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] deluxe edition of the film soundtrack, as well as on the VHS and DVD editions of the film. A reference to "The Jitterbug" remains in the film: the Witch remarks to her flying monkeys that they should have no trouble apprehending Dorothy and her friends because "I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them."

Another musical number cut before release occurred right after the Wicked Witch of the West was melted and before Dorothy and her friends returned to the Wizard. This was a reprise of "Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead" (blended with "[[We're Off to See the Wizard]]" and "The Merry Old Land of Oz") with the lyrics altered to "Hail! Hail! The Witch is Dead!" This started with the Witch's guard saying "Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!" and dissolved to a huge celebration of the citizens of the Emerald City singing the song as they accompany Dorothy and her friends to see the Wizard. Today, the film of this scene is also lost and only a few stills survive, along with a few seconds of footage used on several reissue trailers. The entire audio still exists and is included on the two-CD Rhino Record deluxe edition of the film soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wizard of Oz: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack – The Deluxe Edition'', 2-CD set, original recording remastered, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] # 71964 (July 18, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a brief reprise of "Over the Rainbow" was intended to be sung by Garland while Dorothy is trapped in the Witch's castle, but it was cut because it was considered too emotionally intense. The original soundtrack recording still exists, however, and was included as an extra in all home media releases from 1993-onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Warner Bros. 2005 ''The Wizard of Oz'' Deluxe DVD edition, program notes and audio extras.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these were considerable earnings, the high production cost, in association with various distribution and other costs, meant the movie initially recorded a loss of $1,145,000 for the studio.&lt;ref name="Mannix"/&gt; It did not show what MGM considered a profit until a 1949 re-release earned an additional $1.5 million (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.5|1949|r=0}}}} million today). However, for all the risks and cost that MGM undertook to produce the film, it was considered at least more successful than anyone thought it would be. According to Christopher Finch, author of the Judy Garland biography ''Rainbow: The Stormy Life of Judy Garland'', "Fantasy is always a risk at the box office. The film had been enormously successful as a book, and it had also been a major stage hit, but previous attempts to bring it to the screen had been dismal failures." Finch also writes that after the success of the film, Garland signed a new contract with MGM giving her a substantial increase in salary, making her one of the top-ten box office stars in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Finch |first=Christofer |title=Rainbow: The Stormy Life Of Judy Garland |year=1975 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-28407-5 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film received much acclaim upon its release. [[Frank Nugent]] considered the film a "delightful piece of wonder-working which had the youngsters' eyes shining and brought a quietly amused gleam to the wiser ones of the oldsters. Not since Disney's ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' has anything quite so fantastic succeeded half so well."&lt;ref name="nyt1939"&gt;{{cite news| title= ''The Wizard of Oz'', Produced by the Wizards of Hollywood, Works Its Magic on the Capitol's Screen | url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B07EEDD1138EE3BBC4052DFBE668382629EDE | date= August 18, 1939 | first= Frank S. |last= Nugent| authorlink= Frank S. Nugent| work=The New York Times | accessdate=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nugent had issues with some of the film's special effects, writing, "with the best of will and ingenuity, they cannot make a Munchkin or a Flying Monkey that will not still suggest, however vaguely, a Singer's Midget in a [[Jack Dawn]] masquerade. Nor can they, without a few betraying jolts and split-screen overlappings, bring down from the sky the great soap bubble in which Glinda rides and roll it smoothly into place." According to Nugent, "Judy Garland's Dorothy is a pert and fresh-faced miss with the wonder-lit eyes of a believer in fairy tales, but the Baum fantasy is at its best when the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Lion are on the move."&lt;ref name="nyt1939"/&gt;

Writing in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', John C. Flinn predicted that the film was "likely to perform some record-breaking feats of box-office magic," noting, "Some of the scenic passages are so beautiful in design and composition as to stir audiences by their sheer unfoldment." He also called Garland "an appealing figure" and the musical numbers "gay and bright."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/1939/film/reviews/the-wizard-of-oz-3-1200412289/ |title=Review: 'The Wizard of Oz' |last=Flinn |first=John C. |date=August 16, 1939 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=September 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' wrote, "Even though some persons are not interested in pictures of this type, it is possible that they will be eager to see this picture just for its technical treatment. The performances are good, and the incidental music is of considerable aid. Pictures of this caliber bring credit to the industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 26, 1939 |title=The Wizard of Oz |url=https://archive.org/stream/harrisonsreports21harr#page/n161/mode/2up |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |location=New York |publisher=Harrison's Reports, Inc. |page=134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all reviews were positive. Some moviegoers felt that the 16-year-old Garland was slightly too old to play the little girl who Baum originally intended his Dorothy to be. Russell Maloney of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that the film displayed "no trace of imagination, good taste, or ingenuity" and declared it "a stinkeroo,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/double-take/the-allure-of-oz |title=The Allure of Oz |last=Overbey |first=Erin |date=March 8, 2013 |website=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=September 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Otis Ferguson of ''[[The New Republic]]'' wrote, "It has dwarfs, music, Technicolor, freak characters, and Judy Garland. It can't be expected to have a sense of humor, as well – and as for the light touch of fantasy, it weighs like a pound of fruitcake soaking wet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meyerson |first1=Harold |last2=Harburg |first2=Ernie |date=1995 |title=Who Put the Rainbow in the Wizard of Oz?: Yip Harburg, lyricist |url= |location= |publisher=University of Michigan Press |pages=156–157 |isbn=978-0-472-08312-1 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the film placed seventh on ''[[Film Daily]]'''s year-end nationwide poll of 542 critics naming the best films of 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=January 12, 1940 |title="Ten Best" of 1939 |url=https://archive.org/stream/filmdaily77wids#page/n79/mode/2up |journal=[[Film Daily]] |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
[[Roger Ebert]] chose it as one of his Great Films, writing that "''The Wizard of Oz'' has a wonderful surface of comedy and music, special effects and excitement, but we still watch it six decades later because its underlying story penetrates straight to the deepest insecurities of childhood, stirs them and then reassures them."&lt;ref name=Ebert&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |date=December 22, 1996 |title=The Wizard of Oz (1939) |publisher=rogerebert.com |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19961222/REVIEWS08/401010348/1023 |accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz trailer 2.jpg|thumb|Dorothy in Munchkinland]] 
Writer [[Salman Rushdie]] acknowledged "''The Wizard of Oz'' was my very first literary influence" in his 2002 musings about the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wizard of Oz |last=Rushdie |first=Salman |authorlink=Salman Rushdie |year=2000 |publisher=BFI Pub. |isbn=0-85170-300-3 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_wizard_of_Oz.html?id=clnSeZfFrY8C&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written: "When I first saw ''The Wizard of Oz'', it made a writer of me."&lt;ref name=Rushdie&gt;{{cite book |title=Step Across This Line |last=Rushdie |first=Salman |year=2003 |publisher=Random House |isbn=0-679-78349-0 |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/acmart/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780679783497&amp;view=excerpt |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first short story, written at the age of 10, was titled "Over the Rainbow".&lt;ref name=Rushdie/&gt;

In a 2009 retrospective article about the film, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' film critic and author [[Mick LaSalle]] declared that the film's "entire [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]] sequence, from Dorothy's arrival in Oz to her departure on the yellow brick road, has to be one of the greatest in cinema history – a masterpiece of set design, costuming, choreography, music, lyrics, storytelling, and sheer imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Thoughts on 'The Wizard of Oz' at 70 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Thoughts-on-The-Wizard-of-Oz-at-70-3213164.php|accessdate=February 25, 2010 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |first=Mick |last=LaSalle |date=October 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the film critic aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 111 reviews, with an average score of 9.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "An absolute masterpiece whose groundbreaking visuals and deft storytelling are still every bit as resonant, ''The Wizard of Oz'' is a must-see film for young and old."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_wizard_of_oz_1939//|title=The Wizard of Oz|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film received the maximum score of 100 out of 100, based on 4 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-wizard-of-oz-1939|title=''The Wizard of Oz'' Reviews | publisher = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, as of August 2017, is matched only by five other films.

==Re-releases==
[[File:The Wizard of Oz 1955 Lobby Card.jpg|thumb|This lobby card for the 1955 re-release carried a then-contemporary image of Garland.]]
Although the 1949 reissue used sepia tone, as in the original release, beginning with the 1955 re-issue, and continuing until the film's 50th anniversary [[VHS]] release in 1989, the opening Kansas sequences were shown in black and white instead of the sepia tone as originally printed. (This includes television showings.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= The Wizard of Oz| date= August 30, 2010 |url= http://entertainment.time.com/2010/08/30/top-10-movie-rereleases/slide/the-wizard-of-oz/| first= Gilbert |last= Cruz| work= Time| accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MGM "Children's Matinees" series rereleased the film twice, in both 1970 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kiddiematinee.com/w-woz.html |title=THE WIZARD OF OZ (1939, U.S.) |publisher=Kiddiematinee.com |date=November 3, 1956 |accessdate=March 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112202639/http://www.kiddiematinee.com/w-woz.html |archivedate=January 12, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was for this release that the film received a G rating from the MPAA.

For the film's then-upcoming 60th anniversary, [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] released a "Special Edition" on November 6, 1998, digitally restored with remastered audio.

In 2002, the film had a [[Limited release|very limited re-release]] in U.S. theaters, earning only $139,905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=wizardofoz01.htm|title=The Wizard of Oz (2002 re-issue) (2002) – Box Office Mojo|publisher=boxofficemojo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2009, the film was rereleased in select theaters for a one-night-only event in honor of its 70th anniversary and as a promotion for various new disc releases later in the month. An encore of this event was released in theaters on November 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clclt.com/charlotte/the-wizard-of-oz-70th-anniversary-encore-event/Film?oid=2365152|title=The Wizard of Oz 70th Anniversary Encore Event|agency=Creative Loading}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[IMAX 3D]] theatrical re-release played at 300 theaters in North America for one week only beginning September 20, 2013, as part of the film's 75th anniversary.&lt;ref name="IMAX 3D"&gt;{{cite web |title='Wizard of Oz' coming back to theaters for IMAX 3D run|url=http://family-room.ew.com/2013/06/04/wizard-of-oz-imax-3d-run/| accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. spent $25 million on advertising. The studio hosted a premiere of the film's first IMAX 3D release on September 15, 2013, from the newly remodeled [[TCL Chinese Theatre]] (formerly Grauman's Chinese Theatre, the site of the film's Hollywood premiere) in Hollywood. It was the first to play at the new theater and served as the grand opening of Hollywood's first 3D IMAX screen. It was also shown as a special presentation at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/biz/news/warner-bros-plans-25-million-campaign-around-the-wizard-of-oz-anniversary-1200590969/|title=Warner Bros.

In 2013, in preparation for its IMAX 3D release, the film was submitted again to the MPAA for re-classification. According to MPAA rules, a film that has been altered in any way from its original version must be submitted for re-classification, as the 3-D conversion fell within that guideline. Surprisingly, the 3D version received a PG rating for "Some scary moments", although no change was made to the film's original story content. The 2D version still retains its G rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865584657/6The-Wizard-of-Oz7-reissue-could-signal-the-end-of-the-G-rating.html?pg=all|title=Chris Hicks: ‘The Wizard of Oz’ reissue could signal the end of the G rating|first=Chris|last=Hicks|date=August 14, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
{{Main|The Wizard of Oz on television}}

The film was first shown on television on November 3, 1956, by [[CBS]], as the last installment of the ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Ford Star Jubilee |title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Cable and Network Shows 1946 – present | first = Tim | last= Brooks | first2= Earle | last2=Marsh | page = 425 | publisher= [[Ballantine Books]] | year= 2003 | isbn = 0-345-45542-8 | quote = Last telecast: November 3, 1956&amp;nbsp;... The last telecast of ''Ford Star Jubilee'', however, was really something special. It was the first airing of what later became a television tradition – Garland's classic 1939 film ''The Wizard of Oz'', with Judy's 10-year-old daughter [[Liza Minnelli]] and Lahr (the Cowardly Lion from the film) on hand to introduce it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==

The film was released multiple times for the home-video commercial market (on a limited scale) on [[Super 8 film]] ([[8 mm film|8 mm]] format) during the 1970s. These releases include an edited English version (roughly 10 minutes, and roughly 20 minutes), as well as edited Spanish versions of the classic. Also, a full commercial release of it was made on Super 8 (on multiple reels) that came out in the 1970s, as well, for the commercial market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032138/alternateversions |title=WOO Super 8 |accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was among the first videocassettes (on both [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] format for the 1980 release) by [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/CBS Home Video]] in 1980;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=MGM/CBS Home Video ad|journal= Billboard |date=November 22, 1980  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT58&amp;lpg=PT58&amp;dq=%22MGM+CBS%22+Billboard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_yRY29MTdL&amp;sig=3j5u0LdCHS-AAC77tJ0FQld_Rk0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hTSrTZf0LYnW0QG90pX5CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; all current home video releases are by [[Warner Home Video]] (via current rights holder [[Turner Entertainment]]). The first [[LaserDisc]] release of it was in 1982, with two versions of a second (one from Turner and one from [[The Criterion Collection]] with a commentary track) for the 50th anniversary release in 1989, a third in 1991, a fourth in 1993, a fifth in 1995 and a sixth and final LaserDisc release on September 11, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julien WILK |title=LaserDisc Database – Search: Wizard of Oz |publisher=Lddb.com |date=February 28, 2010 |url=http://www.lddb.com/search.php?search=wizard+of+oz&amp;sort=title |accessdate=March 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to VHS (and later, LaserDisc), the film has been released multiple times during the 1980s on the Betamax format, beginning in 1980 simultaneously with the VHS release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://retrobacktive.wordpress.com/?s=wizard+of+oz+ |title=WOO Beta |accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The film was released for the first and only time on the [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|CED]] format in 1982 by MGM/UA Home Video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wendyswizardofoz.com/selectavision.html |title=WOO CED Exclusive |accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the North American and European markets, the film has also been released multiple times on the [[Video CD]] format since the 1990s in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.webmallindia.com/buy-vcd-online-english-movie-wizard-of-oz-p-2931.html |title=WOO VCD |accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first DVD release was on March 26, 1997, by MGM/Turner and contained no special features or supplements. It was re-released by Warner Bros. for its 60th anniversary on October 19, 1999, with its soundtrack presented in a new 5.1 [[surround sound]] mix. The DVD also contained a behind-the-scenes documentary, ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic'', produced in 1990 and hosted by [[Angela Lansbury]], which was originally shown on television immediately following the 1990 telecast of the film; it had been featured in the 1993 "Ultimate Oz" LaserDisc release. Outtakes, the deleted "Jitterbug" musical number, clips of pre-1939 ''Oz'' adaptations, trailers, newsreels, and a portrait gallery were also included, as well as two radio programs of the era publicizing the film.

In 2005, two DVD editions were released, both featuring a newly restored version of the film with an [[audio commentary]] and an isolated music and effects track. One of the two DVD releases was a "Two-Disc Special Edition", featuring production documentaries, trailers, various outtakes, newsreels, radio shows and still galleries. The other set, a "Three-Disc Collector's Edition", included these features, as well as the digitally restored 80th-anniversary edition of the 1925 feature-length silent film version of ''The Wizard of Oz'', other silent ''Oz'' adaptations and a 1933 animated short version.

The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] on September 29, 2009, for its 70th anniversary in a four-disc "Ultimate Collector's Edition", including all the bonus features from the 2005 Collector's Edition DVD, new bonus features about Victor Fleming and the surviving Munchkins, the telefilm ''[[The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story]]'', and the miniseries ''MGM: When the Lion Roars''. For this edition, Warner Bros. commissioned a new transfer at [[8K Video Format|8K resolution]] from the original negatives. The restoration job was given to Prime Focus World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primefocusworld.com/wizard-of-oz/|title=THE WIZARD OF OZ (1939) 3D|website=Prime Focus World}}&lt;/ref&gt; This restored version also features a [[lossless]] 5.1 [[Dolby TrueHD]] audio track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/MGM/Warner_Home_Video/Film_Restoration/Michael_S._Palmer/Off_To_See_The_Wizards:_HDD_Gets_An_In_Depth_Look_at_the_Restoration_of_The_Wizard_of_Oz_%28UPDATED_-_Before_and_After_Pics!%29/3397 |title=Off To See The Wizards: HDD Gets An In Depth Look at the Restoration of 'The Wizard of Oz' (UPDATED – Before and After Pics!) |publisher=Highdefdigest.com |date=September 11, 2009 |accessdate=March 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, 2009,{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} three Blu-ray discs of the Ultimate Collector's Edition were repackaged as a less expensive "Emerald Edition", with an Emerald Edition four-disc DVD arriving the following week. A single-disc Blu-ray, containing the restored movie and all the extra features of the two-disc Special Edition DVD, also became available on March 16, 2010.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 2013, the film was re-released on DVD, Blu-ray, [[Blu-ray#Blu-ray 3D|Blu-ray 3D]] and [[UltraViolet (system)|UltraViolet]] for the 90th anniversary of [[Warner Bros.]] and as part of its 75th anniversary.&lt;ref name="IMAX 3D" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/movies/125577_Wizard_of_Oz_Goes_3D_for_WB_90th_Celebration/ |title='Wizard of Oz' Goes 3D for W.B. 90th Celebration |publisher=ETonline.com |accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from the novel==
Roughly 40 identifiable major differences exist between the original book and the MGM interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first= Rumeana |last= Jahangir |title= Secrets of the Wizard of Oz |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7933175.stm |publisher= BBC |accessdate=March 18, 2009 | date=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =Rhodes | first =Jesse | publication-date =January 2009 | title =There's No Place Like Home | periodical =Smithsonian | volume =39 | issue =10 | page =25&lt;!--|accessdate=April 24, 2009--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels and reinterpretations==
{{Main|Adaptations of The Wizard of Oz}}

The film was dramatized as a one-hour radio play on ''[[Lux Radio Theatre]]'', which was broadcast on December 25, 1950, with Garland reprising her earlier role. In 1964, a one-hour animated cartoon called ''[[Return to Oz (TV program)|Return to Oz]]'' was shown as an afternoon weekend special on NBC.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} An official 1972 [[sequel]], the animated ''[[Journey Back to Oz]]'' starring [[Liza Minnelli]], daughter of Garland, was produced to commemorate the original film's 35th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejudyroom.com/oz/production.html#timeline |title=The Wizard of Oz Production Timeline| quote =The first official sequel to ''The Wizard of Oz'' is released, an animated film titled ''Journey Back to Oz''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the stage show ''[[The Wiz]]'' premiered on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]]. It was an [[African American]] version of ''The Wizard of Oz'' reworked for the stage. It starred [[Stephanie Mills]] and other Broadway stars and earned a number of [[Tony Awards]]. Its financing was handled by actor [[Geoffrey Holder]]. Its inspired revivals after it left the stage and an unsuccessful [[The Wiz (film)|motion picture]] made in 1978, starring [[Diana Ross]] as Dorothy and [[Michael Jackson]] as the Scarecrow.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In 1985, [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] released the live-action fantasy film ''[[Return to Oz]]'', which starred (and introduced) [[Fairuza Balk]] as a young Dorothy Gale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F03EFD91039F932A15755C0A963948260 | title=Film: A New 'Oz' Gives Dorothy New Friends | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = June 21, 1985 |accessdate=March 8, 2013 | last=Maslin | first = Janet | quote = Instead of the ''Wizard of Oz'' sequel that its title suggests, ''Return to Oz''...&amp;nbsp;is more of a grim variation. This time, in a story derived largely from L. Frank Baum's ''[[The Land of Oz (book)|The Land of Oz]]'' [sic] and ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'', a pint-sized Dorothy has been brought to the screen with a different set of sidekicks; for instance, instead of traveling to Oz with Toto, Dorothy is this time accompanied by a different Baum creation, Billina the Chicken. Once there, she meets a whole new set of friends&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based loosely on ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'' (1904) and ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' (1907), it fared rather poorly with critics who were unfamiliar with the ''Oz'' books and was not successful at the box office, although it has since become a popular [[cult film]], with many considering it a more loyal and faithful adaptation of what L. Frank Baum envisioned.&lt;ref name="Geraghty"&gt;{{cite book | last =Geraghty | first =Lincoln | title =American Hollywood | publisher = Intellect Books | year =2011 | id = | isbn =978-1-84150-415-5| page =187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.etonline.com/movies/131252_Return_to_Oz_Flashback_with_Fairuza_Balk/index.html?viewFull=true | title=Flashback Exclusive: A 'Return to Oz'|date = March 5, 2013 |accessdate=March 15, 2013 | work = ET Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Gregory Maguire published the novel ''[[Wicked (Maguire novel)|Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West]]'', which was adapted into the wildly successful Broadway musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]''. The story describes the life of the Wicked Witch of the West and other events prior to Dorothy's arrival.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

For the film's 56th anniversary, a 1995 stage show also titled ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' was based upon it and the book by L. Frank Baum. It toured from 1995 to 2012, except for 2004.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In 2005, [[The Muppets Studio]] produced ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]],'' a television film for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], starring [[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]] as Dorothy, [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as the Wizard, [[David Alan Grier]] as Uncle Henry, and [[Queen Latifah]] as Aunt Em. [[Kermit the Frog]] portrayed the Scarecrow, [[The Great Gonzo|Gonzo]] portrayed the Tin Thing (Tin Man), [[Fozzie Bear]] portrayed the Lion and [[Miss Piggy]] portrayed all the Witches of the West, East, North and South.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In 2007, [[Syfy|The Sci-Fi Channel]] released the three-part miniseries ''[[Tin Man (miniseries)|Tin Man]]'', a science fiction continuation starring [[Zooey Deschanel]] as DG.

[[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]] wrote a [[The Wizard of Oz (2011 musical)|stage musical of the same name]], which opened in 2011 at the [[West End theatre|West End]]{{'}}s [[London Palladium]]. It features all of the songs from the film plus new songs written by Lloyd Webber and Rice. Lloyd Webber also found [[Danielle Hope]] to play Dorothy on the reality show, ''[[Over the Rainbow (2010 TV series)|Over the Rainbow]]''. Another production opened in December 2012 at the [[Ed Mirvish Theatre]] in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadwayworld.com/article/Canada-to-Launch-OVER-THE-RAINBOW-Reality-Show-to-Cast-Dorothy-in-ALWs-THE-WIZARD-OF-OZ-20120523 "Canada to Launch OVER THE RAINBOW Reality Show to Cast 'Dorothy' in ALW's THE WIZARD OF OZ"], Broadway World, September 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A reality TV show, also titled ''[[Over the Rainbow (Canadian TV series)|Over the Rainbow]]'', found a Canadian girl, Danielle Wade, to play  Dorothy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/overtherainbow/index.html "''Over the Rainbow'': About the Show"], Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

An animated film called ''[[Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz]]'' was released in 2011 by Warner Home Video, incorporating [[Tom and Jerry]] into the story as Dorothy's "protectors".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Tom-and-Jerry-and-The-Wizard-of-Oz-Blu-ray/23662/#Overview Tom and Jerry &amp; The Wizard of Oz Blu-ray] Blu-ray, Retrieved June 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A sequel titled ''[[Tom and Jerry: Back to Oz]]'' was released on DVD on June 21, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warnerbros.com/tom-and-jerry-back-oz TOM AND JERRY: BACK TO OZ] Warnerbros.com, Retrieved June 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] released a [[Spiritual successor|spiritual prequel]] titled ''[[Oz the Great and Powerful]]''. It was directed by [[Sam Raimi]], and starred [[James Franco]], [[Mila Kunis]], [[Rachel Weisz]] and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]]. It was the second film based on Baum's ''Oz'' series to be produced by Disney, after ''Return to Oz''. It was a commercial success and received a mixed critical reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=oz.htm |title=Oz The Great and Powerful (2013) | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/oz_the_great_and_powerful/ |title= Oz the Great and Powerful (2013) |publisher= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date= March 5, 2013 |accessdate= June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, now-defunct independent film company Clarius Entertainment released a big-budget animated musical film, ''[[Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tampubolon |first=Rama |date=May 7, 2013 |title=3D Animated Movie, LEGENDS OF OZ: DOROTHY'S RETURN, Voice Starring Lea Michele, Opens May 9, 2014 And It's Coming To Cannes |website=Rama's Screen |url=http://www.ramascreen.com/3d-animated-movie-legends-of-oz-dorothys-return-voice-starring-lea-michele-opens-may-2-2014-and-its-coming-to-cannes |accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which follows Dorothy's second trip to Oz. The film was a [[box office bomb]] and was received negatively by critics largely for its plot and unmemorable musical numbers.

==Cultural impact==
Regarding the original Baum storybook, it has been said that "''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' is America's greatest and best-loved home grown fairytale. The first totally American fantasy for children, it is one of the most-read children's books&amp;nbsp;... and despite its many particularly American attributes, including a wizard from Omaha, ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' has universal appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wizard of Oz: An American Fairy Tale|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/oz/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was one inductee of a group of 25 films that inaugurated in 1989 the [[National Film Registry]] list,&lt;ref name="registrylist1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-film-preservation-board/documents/wizard_oz.pdf|title=accessed 3/18/2018.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on at least it being declared by the Library of Congress as the most viewed film on television syndication.&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"/&gt; In June 2007, the film was listed on UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-wizard-of-oz-victor-fleming-1939-produced-by-metro-goldwyn-mayer/#c188264 |title=UNESCO chooses ''The Wizard of Oz'' as USA's Memory of the World|publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film placed at number 86 on [[Bravo (US TV network)|Bravo]]'s ''100 Scariest Movie Moments''.&lt;ref name="bravo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml |publisher=Bravotv.com |title=The 100 Scariest Movie Moments |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713230931/http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml |archivedate=July 13, 2006 |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, [[Aljean Harmetz]] wrote ''[[The Making of The Wizard of Oz]]'', a detailed description of the creation of the film based on interviews and research; it was updated in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-7868-8352-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruby slippers===
[[File:Dorothy's Ruby Slippers, Wizard of Oz 1938.jpg|thumb|An original pair of the ruby slippers on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]]]
{{Main|Ruby slippers}}

Because of their iconic stature,&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ruby Slippers: Inventing an American Icon |author=Dwight Blocker Bowers |publisher=The Lemelson Center |date=January 2010 |url=http://invention.smithsonian.org/resources/online_articles_detail.aspx?id=593 |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420213857/http://invention.smithsonian.org/resources/online_articles_detail.aspx?id=593 |archivedate=April 20, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the film are now among the most treasured and valuable [[film memorabilia]] in movie history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burke |first=Monte |date=December 3, 2008 |title=Inside The Search For Dorothy's Slippers |work=[[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/12/03/wizard-slippers-collection-forbeslife-cx_mb_1203slippers.html |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The silver slippers that Dorothy wore in the book series were changed to ruby to take advantage of the new Technicolor process. [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], MGM's chief costume designer, was responsible for the final design. There are five known pairs of the ruby slippers in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/oz/ozsect2.html|title=To See the Wizard – The Wizard of Oz: An American Fairy Tale – Exhibitions – Library of Congress|first1=Baum, L.

(Edgar|last4=Yipsel)|first5=Arlen,|last5=Harold|date=April 21, 2000|website=www.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After filming, the slippers were stored among the studio's extensive collection of costumes and faded from attention. They were found in the basement of MGM's wardrobe department during preparations for a mammoth auction in 1970. One pair was the highlight of the auction, going for a then unheard of $15,000 to an anonymous buyer, who apparently donated them to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1979. Of the four other pairs, one sold for $666,000 at auction in 2000, and another pair was stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in [[Grand Rapids, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ruby Slippers of Oz |last= Thomas|first=Rhys |year= 1989|publisher=Tale Weaver Pub. |isbn=0-942139-09-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 4, 2018, the FBI announced that the slippers have been found in Minneapolis, MN.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblatt, Kalhan.

September 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, differently styled pair unused in the film was sold at auction with the rest of her collections by owner actress [[Debbie Reynolds]] for $510,000 (not including the buyer's premium) in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/debbie_reynolds_auction_breaks_up_historic_hollywood_collection |title=Debbie Reynolds Auction Breaks Up Historic Hollywood Collection |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wes Craven's New Nightmare''''' is a 1994 American [[slasher film]] written and directed by [[Wes Craven]], the original creator of ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''. Although it is the seventh film in the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|franchise]], it is not part of the series continuity, instead portraying [[Freddy Krueger]] as a fictional movie villain who invades the real world, and haunts the cast and crew responsible for his films. In the film, Freddy is depicted as closer to what Craven originally intended, being much more menacing and much less comical, with an updated attire and appearance.

The film features various people involved in the [[Film industry|motion picture industry]] playing themselves, including actress [[Heather Langenkamp]], who is compelled by events in the narrative to reprise her role as [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]]. ''New Nightmare'' features several [[Homage (arts)|homage]]s to the original film such as quotes and recreations of the most famous scenes. The film received generally positive reviews.

==Plot==
[[Heather Langenkamp]] lives in [[Los Angeles]], California, with her husband Chase and their young son Dylan. She has become popular thanks to her role as [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]] from the [[Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' film series]]. One night she has a nightmare that her family is attacked by a set of animated Krueger claws from an upcoming ''Nightmare'' film, where two workers are brutally killed on set. Waking up to an earthquake, she spies a cut on Chase's finger exactly like the one he had received in her dream, but she quickly dismisses the notion that it was caused by the claws.

Heather receives a call from an obsessed fan who quotes [[Freddy Krueger]]'s nursery rhyme in an eerie, Freddy-like voice. This coincides with a meeting she has with [[New Line Cinema]] where she is pitched the idea to reprise her role as Nancy in a new ''Nightmare'' film despite her character being killed on ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'' which, unbeknownst to her, Chase has been working on. When she returns home, she sees Dylan watching her original film. When she interrupts him, he has a severely traumatizing episode where he screams at her. The frequent calls and Dylan's strange behavior cause her to call Chase. He agrees to rush home from his workplace as the two men from the opening dream did not report in for work. Chase falls asleep while driving and is slashed by Freddy's claw and dies. His death seems to affect Dylan even further, which causes concern for Heather's long-time friend and former co-star [[John Saxon]]. He suggests she seek medical attention for Dylan and herself after she has a nightmare at Chase's funeral in which Freddy tries to take Dylan away.

Dylan's health continues to deteriorate. He becomes increasingly paranoid about going to sleep, and fears Freddy Krueger, even though Heather has never shown Dylan her films. She visits ''Nightmare'' creator [[Wes Craven]], who suggests that Freddy is a supernatural entity drawn to his films, freed after the film series ended with the release of ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]''. It now focuses on Heather, as Nancy, its primary foe. Freddy actor [[Robert Englund]] also has a strange knowledge of it, describing the new Freddy to Heather, and then disappearing from all contact shortly after. Following another earthquake, Heather takes a traumatized Dylan to the hospital, where Dr. Heffner, suspecting abuse, suggests he remain under observation. Heather returns home for Dylan's stuffed dinosaur while his babysitter Julie tries unsuccessfully to keep the nurses from sedating the sleep-deprived boy. Dylan falls asleep from the sedative. Freddy brutally kills Julie in Dylan's dream. Capable of [[sleepwalking]], Dylan leaves the hospital of his own accord while Heather chases him home across the interstate as Freddy taunts him and dangles him before traffic. On returning home, Heather realizes that Saxon has established his persona as [[Donald Thompson (film character)|Don Thompson]], and her street and the exterior of her house have transformed into Nancy's. When Heather embraces Nancy's role, Freddy emerges completely into reality and takes Dylan to his world. Heather finds a trail of Dylan's sleeping pills and follows him to a dark underworld. Freddy fights off Heather and chases Dylan into an oven. Dylan escapes the oven, doubles back to Heather, and together they push Freddy into the oven and light it. This destroys both the monster and his reality.

Dylan and Heather emerge from under his blankets, and Heather finds a copy of the film's events in a [[screenplay]] at the foot of the bed. Inside is written thanks from Wes for defeating Freddy and playing Nancy one last time. Her victory helps to imprison the entity of the film franchise's fictitious world once more. Dylan asks if it is a story, and Heather agrees that it is before opening the script and reading from its pages to her son.

==Production==
[[File:New nightmare freddy krueger.jpg|thumb|right|[[Freddy Krueger]]'s appearance in ''New Nightmare'' was the original concept Wes Craven had for the character in ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984).]]
Written under the working title ''A Nightmare on Elm Street 7: The Ascension'', Wes Craven set out to make a deliberately more cerebral film than recent entries to the franchise—which he regarded as being cartoonish, and not faithful to his original themes. The basic premise originated when Craven first signed on to co-write ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors|Dream Warriors]]'', but [[New Line Cinema]] rejected it then.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''New Nightmare'' DVD commentary with Wes Craven&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''New Nightmare'', Krueger was portrayed closer to what Craven had imagined: darker and less [[Comedy|comical]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/nightmareinterviewswesandsequels.html A Nightmare On Elm Street : Interviews – Wes Craven And A Nightmare Of Sequels&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314233141/http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/nightmareinterviewswesandsequels.html |date=March 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To reinforce this, the character's make-up and outfit were enhanced, with one of the most prominent differences being that he now wears a long blue/black trenchcoat. In addition, the signature glove was redesigned for a more [[Organic matter|organic]] look, with the fingers resembling bones and having muscle textures in between.&lt;ref name="The Glove"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/nightmareinterviewstheglove.html |title=The Glove |last=Schoell |first=William |authorlink=William Schoell |work=Nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131222736/http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/nightmareinterviewstheglove.html |archivedate=January 31, 2009 |accessdate=2016-03-15 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Robert Englund]] again plays the character, "Freddy Krueger" is credited as "Himself" in the [[Closing credits|end credits]].

While earthquake scenes were already written into the film from the beginning, production of the film happened to take place concurrently with the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]] in Los Angeles. As such, the production team decided to incorporate real footage of the earthquake's structural damage into the film.&lt;ref name="Buzzfeed"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/how-new-nightmare-changed-the-horror-game

Craven had intended to ask [[Johnny Depp]], whose feature film debut was in the first film, to make an appearance as himself, but was too timid to ask him. Upon running into each other after the film's release, Depp said he would have been happy to do it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Reception==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 78% of 37 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "''Wes Craven's New Nightmare'' adds an unexpectedly satisfying - not to mention intelligent - meta layer to a horror franchise that had long since lost its way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wes_cravens_new_nightmare/|title=Wes Craven's New Nightmare|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2016-06-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525111840/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wes_cravens_new_nightmare|archivedate=May 25, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several critics have subsequently said that ''New Nightmare'' could be regarded as a prelude to the ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971212/REVIEWS/712120304/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Scream 2 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606144535/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19971212%2FREVIEWS%2F712120304%2F1023 | archivedate=June 6, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;—both sets of films deal with the idea of bringing horror films to "real life".

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave ''New Nightmare'' three stars out of four and said, "I haven't been exactly a fan of the ''Nightmare'' series, but I found this movie, with its unsettling questions about the effect of horror on those who create it, strangely intriguing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19941014/REVIEWS/410140306/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Wes Craven's New Nightmare | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007064735/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19941014%2FREVIEWS%2F410140306%2F1023 | archivedate=October 7, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Sommerfield from the horror website Slasher Studios gave it four out of four stars and said, "''New Nightmare'' is that rare horror film in which everything works. The performances are pitch perfect, led by a tour-de-force performance by the amazing Langenkamp. The script has many twists and turns and the movie is quite possibly the best looking of the entire series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.slasherstudios.com/2011/05/11/new-nightmare-movie-meta-magic/ |title=Meta Movie Magic: "Wes Craven’s New Nightmare" Review &amp;#124; |publisher=Slasherstudios.com |date=2011-05-11 |accessdate=2013-07-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801072247/http://www.slasherstudios.com/2011/05/11/new-nightmare-movie-meta-magic/ |archivedate=August 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s [[Owen Gleiberman]] gave ''New Nightmare'' a negative review, stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;After a good, gory opening, in which Freddy's glove—newly designed with sinews and muscles—slashes the throat of the special-effects guy who's been working on it, the movie succumbs to a kind of sterile inertia. ''Wes Craven's New Nightmare'' isn't about Freddy haunting a film set, which actually might have been fun. It's about Heather Langenkamp, star of the original ''Nightmare on Elm Street'', being menaced for two long, slow hours by earthquakes, cracks in the wall, and other weary portents of doom.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Gleiberman described the film as "just an empty hall of mirrors" that "lacks the trancelike dread of the original" and the "ingeniously demented special effects" of ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors|Dream Warriors]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,304239,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=Movie Review: Movie Review: 'Wes Craven's New Nightmare' | date=October 28, 1994 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425133428/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C304239%2C00.html | archivedate=April 25, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''New Nightmare'' happens to be Robert Englund's favorite ''Nightmare'' movie: "I think it stands the test of time, a fun reunion with original cast members like Heather and John Saxon.  Wes’s script is clever and original, the self-referencial horror story."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/725682-robert-englund-an-exclusive-interview&lt;/ref&gt; Heather Langenkamp is also very supportive of the movie, saying, "I was just really shocked that I was in the movie so much, I had totally forgotten I was the star of that movie. It was interesting because all my scenes are kind of alone, and I was acting against this tension and this idea of Freddy that we all had at that time. We all knew what I was afraid of and that Freddy might be back, but you never really saw Freddy that much, and I was really amazed that the movie was about Wes [Craven] creating this relationship with that idea that Freddy is here, and the audience has it too. It’s a really interesting concept, and it’s one of the only horror movies where the monster’s really in the background, at least until the end. But it’s all about our mentality about fear."&lt;ref&gt;http://nerdbastards.com/2014/09/01/fan-expo-heather-langenkamp-reminisces-about-being-freddys-first-final-girl/&lt;/ref&gt;
