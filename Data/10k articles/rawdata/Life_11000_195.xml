On 27 January 1969, Iraqi authorities hanged 14 alleged spies (nine Jews, three Muslims and two Christians) for [[Israel]] in a public execution in Baghdad.&lt;ref name="haaretz"&gt;{{cite news |date=27 January 2014 |title=This Day in Jewish History / Nine Jewish 'spies' are hanged in Baghdad |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/.premium-1.570665 |newspaper=Haaretz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
By 1969, [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraq's]] Jewish community had shrunk from more than 130,000 in 1948 to less than 3,000 due to mass emigration caused the establishment of the State of Israel, the subsequent Arab-Israeli wars, and anti-Jewish persecution.&lt;ref name="haaretz"/&gt;

The lopsided defeat suffered by the Arab states, including Iraq, against Israel in the June 1967 [[Six-Day War]] further increased discrimination against Iraq's remaining Jews: "They were dismissed from government jobs, their bank accounts were frozen and they were confined to house arrest, among other restrictions."&lt;ref name="haaretz"/&gt;

In July 1968, the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] took control of Iraq in a [[17 July Revolution|bloodless coup]].  The new government was weak and was in constant fear that it would itself be the target of a coup. After the [[Israeli Air Force]] struck an Iraqi military position in northern Jordan on 4 December 1968 in retaliation for the shelling of Israeli communities in the Galilee, the Ba'athist regime began "hunting down an American-Israeli spy ring it said was trying to destabilize Iraq." The authorities began arresting alleged conspirators shortly thereafter, including twelve Jewish men from Baghdad and Basra.&lt;ref name="haaretz"/&gt;

==The hangings==
[[File:Prayer sculpture Ramat Gan.jpg|thumb|200px|Memorial in [[Ramat Gan]], [[Israel]] dedicated to the Iraqi Jews killed in the 1969 hangings and the 1941 [[Farhud]]]]
''Baghdad Radio'' invited citizens to [[Liberation Square, Baghdad|Liberation Square]] on January 27 to "come and enjoy the feast."&lt;ref name="Makiya 52"/&gt; 500,000 people reportedly attended the hangings, and danced and celebrated before the corpses of the convicted spies. Nine of the fourteen hanged were Jews. The remaining three Jews of the initial twelve arrested were executed on 26 August 1969.&lt;ref name="haaretz"/&gt;

===The Jewish victims===
The nine Jewish victims were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=January–February 1973 |title=4th Anniversary of a Crime Against Humanity: The Baghdad Hangings |url=http://www.thescribe.info/pdf/TheScribe09.pdf#page=3 |newspaper=The Scribe |quote="The ages here given were those announced in the broadcast. However, the actual ages of the Jewish students were 17–19 years, but as Iraqi law prohibits the execution of persons under the age of 20, it is evident that the military court forced them to declare a higher age and to confirm this in their 'confessions' in order that their execution could be carried out."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The executions led to significant international criticism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=29 January 1969 |title=Iraq Ignores World Outrage over Executions, Announces Other ‘spies’ Will Be Tried |url=http://www.jta.org/1969/01/29/archive/iraq-ignores-world-outrage-over-executions-announces-other-spies-will-be-tried |agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 January 1969 |title=Eshkol Outraged, Denounces Hangings, and Denies Iraqi Jews Were Israeli Spies |url=http://www.jta.org/1969/01/28/archive/eshkol-outraged-denounces-hangings-and-denies-iraqi-jews-were-israeli-spies |agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[United States]] [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William P. Rogers]] condemning Iraq's actions as "repugnant to the conscience of the world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Bryan R.|title=Sold Out? US Foreign Policy, Iraq, the Kurds, and the Cold War|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=978-1-137-48711-7|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Egypt]]'s ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' cautioning: "The hanging of fourteen people in the public square is certainly not a heart-warming sight, nor is it the occasion for organizing a spectacle." By contrast, the [[Soviet Union]]'s official radio called the executions "fully justified," while [[Charles de Gaulle]] of [[France]] said they could not be divorced from the broader [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. ''Baghdad Radio'' rebutted Iraq's critics: "We hanged spies, but [[Jewish deicide|the Jews crucified Christ]]."&lt;ref name="Makiya 52"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Kanan Makiya|last=Makiya|first=Kanan|title=Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq, Updated Edition|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|isbn=9780520921245|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author [[Kanan Makiya]], the negative publicity "has less to do with the activities of a [[Zionism|Zionist]] lobby as the Ba'ath claimed, as much as it was the outcome of the deliberately public nature of the proceedings. Later the Ba'ath learnt the art of sealing out the outside world."&lt;ref name="Makiya 52"/&gt; The persecution of Iraq's Jews continued after the spy trials: "By the time of the August executions, 51 Jews had been killed by the regime in 1969 alone; 100 more were imprisoned or tortured." In the early 1970s, nearly all of Iraq's Jewish population left after being permitted to leave. Only a small number stayed behind, largely those who were too old to travel.&lt;ref name="haaretz"/&gt;

Makiya credits the hangings with helping the Ba'athist government consolidate control of Iraq, stating: "The terror that, from a Ba'athist viewpoint, was premature and badly handled in [[Ramadan Revolution|1963]], worked and was skillfully deployed the second time around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Kanan Makiya|last=Makiya|first=Kanan|title=Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq, Updated Edition|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1998|isbn=9780520921245|pp=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:01 of spades A.svg|thumb|180px|[[Ace]] of [[suit (cards)|spades]]]]
[[File:Friz.jpg|Right|thumb|180px|1828 "Old Frizzle"]]
The '''ace of spades''' (also known as the '''spadille'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=spadille "Spadille" in Merriam-Webster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019173251/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=spadille |date=2015-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is traditionally the highest and most valued card in the deck of [[playing card]]s, at least in English-speaking countries. The actual value of the card varies from game to game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psywarrior.com/DeathCardsAce.html Death Cards - Psychological Operations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715120241/http://www.psywarrior.com/DeathCardsAce.html |date=2014-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newtscards.com/secret_weapon_death_playing_cards.asp |title=The Tarot Death Card |accessdate=2009-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226120913/http://www.newtscards.com/secret_weapon_death_playing_cards.asp |archivedate=2007-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The ornate design of the [[ace]] of [[Spades (suit)|spades]], common in packs today, stems from the 17th century, when [[James I of England|James I]] and later [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] imposed laws requiring the ace of spades to bear an insignia of the printing house. [[Stamp duty#United Kingdom|Stamp duty]], an idea imported to England by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], was extended to playing cards in 1711 by Queen Anne and lasted until 1960.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{Citation|title=A Brief History of Playing Cards|last=Knuckle|first=White|url=http://www.whiteknucklecards.com/history/briefhistory.html|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=E |title=The English Stamp Duties, 1664-1764 |year=2004 |publisher=English Historical Review |page=245 |volume=56, no.222 (April 1941)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years a number of methods were used to show that duty had been paid. From 1712 onwards, one of the cards in the pack, usually the ace of spades, was marked with a hand stamp. In 1765 hand stamping was replaced by the printing of official ace of spades by the Stamp Office, incorporating the royal coat of arms. In 1828 the Duty Ace of Spades (known as "Old Frizzle") was printed to indicate a reduced duty of a [[shilling]] had been paid.&lt;ref name="Schott's"/&gt;

The system was changed again in 1862 when official [[threepence (British coin)|threepenny]] duty wrappers were introduced and although the makers were free to use whatever design they wanted, most chose to keep the ornate ace of spades that is popular today.&lt;ref name="Schott's"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schott |first=Ben |authorlink= Ben Schott |title=[[Schott's Miscellanies|Schott's Sporting, Gaming &amp; Idling Miscellany]] |year=2004 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-7475-6924-X |page=62 |chapter=Card Tax &amp; The Ace of Spades}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ace of spades is thus used to show the card manufacturer's information.

The exact design of the ace card was so important, it eventually became the subject of design patents and trademarking. For example, on December 5, 1882, George G. White was granted US design patent US0D0013473&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=D0013473&amp;SectionNum=1&amp;IDKey=31F8B0976730|title=Patent Images|website=patimg2.uspto.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his design. His ace design was adorned with male and female figures leaning onto the spade from either side.

==War==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
[[File:OperationBaker1967Vietcongaceofspades.ogv|thumb|200px|right|US Army footage from 'Operation Baker' 1967 showing US troops putting Ace of Spades in the mouths of dead VietCong/NLF (can be seen 1:53 min:sec &amp; 2:34 min:sec into the video footage) ]] 
The ace of spades has been employed, on numerous occasions, in the theater of war. In the [[Second World War]], the soldiers of the [[506th Parachute Infantry Regiment]] of the [[United States|American]] [[101st Airborne Division]] were marked with the spades symbol painted on the sides of their helmets. In this capacity, it was used to represent good luck, due to its fortunate connotations in card playing. All four card suits were used for ease of identification of regiments within the airborne division following the confusion of a large scale combat airborne operation. Battalions within the regiments were denoted with tic marks or dots, marked from top clockwise: headquarters at the twelve o'clock position, 1st Battalion at the three o'clock, etc.

Some twenty years later, a folk legend about the ace of spades being used by American Soldiers during the [[Vietnam War]] was popularized. Supposedly, US troops believed that Vietnamese traditions held the symbolism of the spade to mean death and ill-fortune and in a bid to frighten and demoralize [[Viet Cong]] soldiers, it was common practice to mockingly leave an ace of spades on the bodies of killed Vietnamese and even to litter the forested grounds and fields with the card.{{cn|date=December 2016}} This custom was said to be so effective that the [[United States Playing Card Company]] was asked by Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment to supply crates of that single card in bulk. The crates were often marked with "Bicycle Secret Weapon".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newtscards.com/secret_weapon_death_playing_cards.asp Ace of Spades or Secret Weapon Death Playing Cards at Newt's Playing Cards&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226120913/http://www.newtscards.com/secret_weapon_death_playing_cards.asp |date=December 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=December 2016}} The ace of spades, while not a symbol of superstitious fear to the Viet Cong forces, did help the morale of American soldiers. It was not unheard of for US Soldiers and Marines to stick this card in their helmet band as a sort of anti-peace sign.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

More recently, in 2003 a deck of [[most-wanted Iraqi playing cards]] was issued to US Soldiers during [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Operation Iraqi Freedom]], each card had the picture of a wanted Iraqi official on it. [[Saddam Hussein]] got the nickname "Ace of Spades" as that card bore his image.

==Idioms==
Various [[idiom]]s involving the ace of spades include "black as the ace of spades" (which can refer either to [[Black|color]] or to [[Black people|race]]), or alternatively a lack of cleanliness in a person&lt;ref&gt;
*Gandhi, Lakshmi, [https://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/09/19/224183763/is-it-racist-to-call-a-spade-a-spade "Is It Racist To 'Call a Spade a Spade'?"], ''Codeswitch'', [[National Public Radio]], September 23, 2013 (retrieved June 14, 2014)
*For an example of the latter, see Aaron McGruder, ''Public Enemy #2: An All-New ''Boondocks'' Collection'' (New York: Three Rivers Press, 2005), front cover.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[French language|French]] expression ''fagoté comme l'as de pique''—that is, "(badly) dressed like the ace of spades."&lt;ref&gt;"As", ''Cassell's New French Dictionary'' (5th ed., 1951).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ali ibn Faramurz''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: علی بن فرامرز), was the [[Kakuyid]] [[Emir]] of [[Yazd]] and [[Abarkuh]]. He was the son of [[Faramurz]].

== Biography ==

In 1076/1077, Ali married a daughter of [[Chaghri Beg]] named Arslan Katun, who was the widow of the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Qa'im (caliph)|Al-Qa'im]] (1031-1075). Ali was a faithful vassal Seljuk and spent most of his reign at the court of the Seljuq [[Malik-Shah I]] in [[Isfahan]].

After the death of Malik-Shah I in 1092, Ali supported his brother [[Tutush I]] that dominated the western part of the [[Seljuq Empire]], and considered his right to the throne more superior than [[Barkiyaruq]]. Tutush, however, was decisively defeated in a battle near [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] in 1095, where he and Ali were killed.{{sfn|Bosworth|1985|pp=848–849}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=38}} Ali was succeeded by his son [[Garshasp II]].

'''''Animal Crackers''''' is the title of several syndicated newspaper comics over the years. The first was a 1930 comic strip signed by an artist known simply as Lane.

The second ''Animal Crackers'' was a cartoon panel by Dick Ryan and Warren Goodrich (1913–2002) that was published intermittently from 1937 through 1957. In some papers it ran as '''''Animal Krackers'''''.

The third began in 1967 and continues today, distributed by [[Tribune Content Agency]]&lt;ref name="tca"&gt;{{cite web |title=Animal Crackers by Mike Osbun |url=https://tribunecontentagency.com/premium-content/comics/animal-crackers/ |website=Tribune Content Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appearing on [[Andrews McMeel Universal]]'s [[GoComics]], which is run by [[Universal Uclick]].

''The San Francisco Chronicle'' described ''Animal Crackers'' as a "snappy little one-frame strip [that] featured a variety of animal life dealing with various silly situations of a human nature" and as a comic panel "which went on to acclaim in syndication."&lt;ref name="The San Francisco Chronicle"&gt;Adolphson, Sue (August 23, 1992). "The Golden Boy: The Chronicle's Little Man Turns 50". ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]''. Sunday Datebook, Pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The ''San Francisco Chronicle'' printed the comic panel on its front page next to the weather report.&lt;ref name="Town Crier1"&gt;(January 30, 2002). "[http://www.latc.com/2002/01/30/special_sect/people1.html Warren Goodrich, co-founder of the ''Los Altos Town Crier'', dies at 88] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927173247/http://www.latc.com/2002/01/30/special_sect/people1.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}".

Goodrich recalled about the strip, "I used animals to relate human foibles with a little twist. Sometimes it would work, and sometimes it wouldn't. It seems the funny things are just short of tragic."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newspaperarchive.com/ Kennedy, Natalie. "Talent, humor lead Travelin Man down road of success," "The Wellsboro Gazette and Free Press-Courier'', March 25, 1992.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, Goodrich drew a spin-off cartoon series, ''Creatures'', collected in the book ''Creatures Or Not So Dumb Animals'' (Eden East Press, 2001). Although Goodrich drew his animal cartoons for years and then wrote newspaper columns ("Travelin' Man") and several books (''An Artist's Life''), his lasting fame came with a single drawing, "The Little Man," which he drew in 1942. Used alongside ''San Francisco Chronicle'' film reviews as a movie rating system, this Goodrich device was praised by [[Roger Ebert]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/09/you_give_out_too_many_stars.html Ebert, Roger.

=== Publication history ===
[[Roger Bollen]] drew the strip through 1994, and then [[Fred Wagner (cartoonist)|Fred Wagner]] took over until his death in 2016. The strip is now drawn by long-time ''Animal Crackers'' writer, Mike Osbun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Inman|first1=Jessica|title=Fred Wagner: Syndicated cartoonist dreamt of painting|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/obituaries/os-obit-fred-wagner-cartoonist-20160629-story.html|website=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features a group of animals who live in a fictional jungle called Freeborn. This strip was adapted into a [[Animal Crackers (TV series)|cartoon television series]] in 1997.

=== Characters and story ===
* '''Lyle Lion''' — passive, insecure, and a momma's boy, Lyle [[Lion]] is not what one might call "King of the Jungle". He's more (of a Prince who is trying to be king) intent on talking philosophy and ordering a pizza (preferably vegetarian) than be the dominant predator. His number one goal in life is to date Lana, being very persistent about it despite the multiple failed attempts; outside of that, his other goal is to be an astronomer. From the show, it is believed that he is left-handed.
* '''Dodo''' — he is the last remaining [[dodo]] alive, and is Lyle's best friend. Rash, impatient, and slightly self-centred, he is extremely hot-headed and refuses to believe that he lacks the ability to fly. This leads to multiple failed attempts to take flight, sometimes using some very innovative yet unusual techniques.
* '''Eugene''' — despite his size and nature, this [[Elephant|pachyderm]] is really an "overgrown baby" who craves attention. He is rather arrogant and obnoxious and is not afraid to bully others with his size and strength to get what he wants. Some of his secret pleasures include inhaling loads of [[peanut butter]] and stomping [[petunia]]s, but the sight of a tiny [[mouse]] will usually give him a fit.
* '''Gnu''' — for a "supposed" leader of a herd, [[Gnu]] lacks any leadership qualities; rather, his traits show the exact opposite of a leader: lazy, timid, no sense of direction. Despite his nature, Gnu does mean well and is very dedicated to his herd, even though his presence there will hinder rather than help. He is also a caring parent, as he is a single father who has one son that he loves very much.
* '''Lana''' — she is smart, attractive, strong minded, and the object of Lyle's affection. Lana is quite caring towards her fellow inhabitants of Freeborn, and will put the group ahead of herself. She is also an avid book lover, often found with her nose in a novel. Despite showing little to no interest in Lyle's pursuits, it has been hinted that perhaps she does have a crush on him; but only Lana knows the answer to that question, and her lips are sealed.

The '''MV ''Apollo Sea''''' was a [[China|Chinese-owned]], [[Panama|Panamanian-registered]] [[bulk carrier]] which sank near [[Cape Town]] in June 1994. Leaking oil from the sunken vessel caused a major environmental disaster which resulted in the death of thousands of seabirds, including endangered [[African penguin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://penguins.adu.org.za/sp003_01.php |title=Five years of monitoring African Penguins after the Apollo Sea oil spill: a success story made possible by ringing |date=2000-07-11 |accessdate=2014-08-17 |website=Penguin Watch |last=Underhill |first=L. G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the ship's 36 crew members died in the sinking, which apparently occurred so quickly that no general distress signals were given.&lt;ref name=response /&gt;  The first public indication that the ship had sunk was the appearance of penguins covered with oil. The source of the slick was initially believed to be the wreck of the supertanker [[Castillo de Bellver oil spill|''Castillo de Bellver'']], but this theory was disproven and the slick was instead traced to the wreck of the ''Apollo Sea''. The vessel had been loaded with 2,400 tonnes (2,700 cubic metres) of [[Fuel oil#Bunker fuel|heavy fuel oil]] when she left port four hours before she sank.&lt;ref name=response/&gt; Later it was revealed that an automated distress signal had been sent directly to the owners via satellite from the approximate location of the oil spill, and the owners eventually admitted the loss of the vessel and accepted responsibility for the spill.&lt;ref name=dieburger /&gt;&lt;ref name=response /&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
Gale-force winds hampered attempts to protect Cape Town from the emerging oil slick, and city beaches were streaked with oil. The oil affected the breeding grounds of the endangered [[African penguin]] on [[Dassen Island]]. Attempts were made to evacuate penguins to the mainland, but efforts were impeded by the rough weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article118174552 |title = S. African city faces pollution disaster|last = |first = |date = 1994-06-27|work = |accessdate = 2014-08-17|newspaper = The Canberra Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

10,000 penguins were collected and cleaned. Of those, approximately 5,000 survived. Six years later, the region's seabird rookeries were threatened by a similar incident; the [[MV Treasure oil spill|MV ''Treasure'' oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-109629570.html|title = Race to Save Penguins in Black Tide of Death|last = |first = |date = 2000-06-27|work = |accessdate = 2014-08-23|newspaper = Daily Mail|publication-place = London, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archduke Wilhelm Franz Karl of Austria-Teschen''' (German: Erzherzog '''Wilhelm Franz Karl von Habsburg-Lothringen''', 21 April 1827 &amp;ndash; 29 April 1894) was an [[Archduke]] of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] from the [[House of Habsburg]].

He was born in [[Vienna]] as the son of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen]] (1771–1847) and [[Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg]] (1797–1829). He was a grandson of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] (1747–1792) and nephew of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz II]] (1768–1835), the last two Holy Roman Emperors.

He held the office of [[Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights]] from 1863 until his death in 1894. He gained the rank of ''[[General of the branch|Feldzeugmeister]]'' in the service of the Austrian Army in January 1867, after commanding the artillery and being wounded at the [[Battle of Königgrätz]] (1866). He was Governor of the [[Fortress of Mainz|Federal Fortress of Mainz]].

Archduke Wilhelm of Austria died unmarried and without issue on 29 July 1894 in [[Baden bei Wien|Weikersdorf]] after falling from a horse. He had been riding in Baden when his horse was frightened by a motor car. The horse bolted, and the Archduke was thrown. One of his feet remained stuck in the stirrup, and he was dragged more than 100 yards. He died without regaining consciousness. His death was attributed to a concussion on the brain. The archduke was 67 years old.

A '''beating heart cadaver''' is a body that is pronounced dead in all medical and legal definitions, connected to a [[medical ventilator]], and retains cardio-pulmonary functions. This keeps the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] of the body, including the [[heart]], functioning and alive.&lt;ref name="stiff"&gt;[[Roach, Mary]]. ''Stiff: the Curious Lives of Human Cadavers''. New York: W.W. Norton &amp;, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the period of time in which the organs may be used for [[Organ transplantation|transplantation]] is extended. The heart contains pacemaker cells that will cause the heart to continue beating even when a patient is brain-dead. Other organs in the body do not have this capability and need the brain to be functioning to send signals to the organs to carry out their functions. A beating heart cadaver requires a ventilator to provide oxygen to its blood, but the heart will continue to beat on its own even in the absence of brain activity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Undead: Organ Harvesting, the Ice-Water Test, Beating-Heart Cadavers - How Medicine is Blurring the Line Between Life and Death|last = Teresi|first = Dick|publisher = Pantheon Books|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-375-42371-0|location = New York|pages = 89–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows organs to be preserved for a longer period of time in the case of a transplant or donation. A small number of cases in recent years indicate that it can also be implemented for a brain-dead pregnant woman to reach the full term of her pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; There is an advantage to beating heart cadaver organ donation because doctors are able to see the vitals of the organs and tell if they are stable and functioning before transplanting to an ailing patient.&lt;ref name="Zamperetti, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zamperetti|first1=N|title=Defining death in non-heart beating organ donors|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|volume=29|issue=3|year=2003|pages=182–185|issn=0306-6800|doi=10.1136/jme.29.3.182|pmc=1733717}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is not possible in a donation from someone pronounced dead. There is a stigma around beating heart cadavers regarding the accuracy doctors have in pronouncing someone brain dead due to recent discoveries of brain activity in subjects that were classified as "brain-dead".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saposnik|first1=Gustavo|last2=Basile|first2=Vincenzo S.|last3=Young|first3=G. Bryan|title=Movements in Brain Death: A Systematic Review|journal=Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences |volume=36|issue=2|year=2014|pages=154–160|issn=0317-1671|doi=10.1017/S031716710000651X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, the organ donation world is desperate to widen its pool of donors to meet the ever-increasing demand from heightened rates of organ destroying diseases. As diseases progress, the functionality of organs is diminished and for some, a new organ is the only chance of survival. [[Heart disease]], [[diabetes]], and [[respiratory disease]] are among the leading causes of death worldwide and each condition could be improved if a new organ is received.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; However, some argue that using another person’s body purely as a means to an end, dehumanizes the patient.&lt;ref name="Bastami, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bastami|first1=Sohaila|last2=Matthes|first2=Oliver|last3=Krones|first3=Tanja|last4=Biller-Andorno|first4=Nikola|title=Systematic Review of Attitudes Toward Donation After Cardiac Death Among Healthcare Providers and the General Public|journal=Critical Care Medicine|volume=41|issue=3|year=2013|pages=897–905|issn=0090-3493|doi=10.1097/CCM.0b013e31827585fe|pmid=23328261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The observed phenomena of lifelike qualities after death is not a new concept. In [[René Descartes]]' ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', he notes that decapitated animals move and display characteristics of a living body a few seconds after decapitation which was published in 1637.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This continued into the [[French Revolution]] where it was observed that people who had been beheaded showed movements in facial muscles and hearts could continue to beat for almost an hour past the time of beheading.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daroff, R.|date=2007|title=The Historical Evolution of Brain Death from Former Definitions of Death: the Harvard Criteria to the Present|url=|journal=The Signs of Death |volume=110 |pages=217–221|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guillotine in some cases did not completely sever head from body. In 1875 an examiner named Pierre Jean Cabanis was assigned the duty of making sure a body was truly dead.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There were also stories involving beheadings where the victims would stand up and walk around before falling dead. The ambiguity around brain death and true death has followed it to present day. In an effort to clarify some of these gray areas, the Harvard Medical Committee developed criteria for identifying a body as dead in 1968.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These criteria required patients to be completely unaware and unresponsive to external stimuli, have no spontaneous muscle movements, and exhibit no reflexive response even when manipulated. They also required that an electroencephalography ([[Electroencephalography|EEG]]) show no signs of activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The purpose of this report was to encourage physicians to distinguish brain death and irreversible coma from a [[persistent vegetative state]] where the patient still has some awareness and cycles through sleep and wakefulness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors = Wijdicks F, Valrelas P, Gronseth G, Greer D|date=2010|title=American Academy of Neurology Guidelines for Brain Death Determination|url=|journal=Neurology |volume=74 |pages=1911–1918|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 a similar Minnesota criteria was published eliminating the EEG, repeating the exam after 12 hours, a severe lesion in the brain, and increasing the duration of the apnea test to four minutes rather than Harvard's three minute guideline. Other slight changes in the next decades included the United Kingdom's decision to eliminate the repetition of the exam and change from a duration of the apnea test to specified levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in 1976.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Later, in 1981 the President's Commission reinstated the apnea test and the repeat exam. Unfortunately, in a study done in 1989 only 35% of health care physicians correctly identified brain death using these criteria.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grtl.org/?q=beating-heart-cadeavors|title=Beating Heart Cadavers|last=Ward|first=S|date=2015|website=Georgia Right to Life|publisher=|access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A serious cause for concern. Presently, there is hot debate over the protocol for diagnosing someone as brain dead and there are not currently any enforced standard procedures for assessing a body.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The unofficial standards have improved and become more specified in recent years due to the development of medical technology.

The [[American Academy of Neurology]] created a prerequisite and neurological clinical assessment to be used as guidelines for determining brain death published in 2010.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To be considered for brain death the body must have a determinant cause of coma, have normal systolic blood pressure, and pass two neurological tests. These neurological assessments commonly consist of an apnea test, reflex tests where the body is manipulated or exposed to a stimulus and does not react, or be in a coma where there is complete unresponsiveness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Cerebral angiography]], electroencephalography, transcranial doppler ultrasonography, and cerebral scintigraphy are some of the tests that are used to test if there is any significant brain activity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Care==
Caring for a beating heart cadaver is similar to caring for a living patient. Since the brain has stopped functioning, the hormone levels and blood pressure must be regulated by [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) personnel.&lt;ref name="Roach170"/&gt; The protocol for preserving the cadaver aims to prevent infection and maintain adequate [[Oxygenation (medicine)|oxygenation]] of tissue.&lt;ref name= "surgerydoor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surgerydoor.co.uk/advice/organ-donation/beating-heart-donor |title=The beating heart donor |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=British Organ Donor Society |publisher= |access-date=4 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cadaver's status must be continuously monitored, so that ICU staff can prevent organ failure or quickly operate to save threatened organs.&lt;ref name="Roach170"&gt;Roach, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organ recovery==
A beating heart cadaver is kept alive in order to keep its organs from decaying before they can be transplanted. Surgeons will remove the organs, one after the other, and have them transferred to the recipients' treating teams.&lt;ref name="stiff"/&gt; The entire recovery process is usually completed within four hours.&lt;ref name="surgerydoor"/&gt; This process was formerly known as an "organ harvest", but the name has since changed to the milder "organ recovery".&lt;ref name="stiff"/&gt; Many organs can be extracted, and many lives can be saved by one body.  The bodies are generally those of [[Organ donation|organ donors]], who have either given first-person consent to become an organ donor, presumptive consent by not explicitly declining to donate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are we in control of our own decisions?|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_asks_are_we_in_control_of_our_own_decisions|quote=So I want to show you some cognitive illusions, or decision-making illusions, in the same way. And this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences. It's from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein. And it basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in giving their organs to donation....Turns out the secret has to do with a form at the DMV. And here is the story. The countries on the left have a form at the DMV that looks something like this. Check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program. And what happens? People don't check, and they don't join. The countries on the right, the ones that give a lot, have a slightly different form. It says check the box below if you don't want to participate. Interestingly enough, when people get this, they again don't check -- but now they join.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or whose legal next-of-kin makes the decision to donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/feb/27/her-donated-organs-changed-lives-of-many/ |title=Her donated organs changed lives of many  |last=Bell |first=Diane |date= 27 February 2010|website=The San Diego Union Tribune |publisher= |access-date=4 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some donated organs are taken from [[Non-heart-beating donation|non-heart-beating donors]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physiciansforlife.org/content/view/166/33/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114115030/http://www.physiciansforlife.org/content/view/166/33/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 November 2014 |title=Brain Death or NHBD – Important Distinction  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=physiciansforlife.org |publisher= |access-date=4 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organs from [[brain death]]s, however, have a better success rate, and currently most organ donation is from these deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://surgery.about.com/od/proceduresaz/ss/OrganDonation_3.htm |title=Organ Donation Types  |last= Whitlock|first= Jennifer|date=6 April 2016 |website=verywell.com |publisher= |access-date=13 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

How long the brain-dead person is kept on the ventilator may vary depending on the availability of surgical teams and the wishes of the family of that brain-dead person. Although it is claimed the brain-dead patient cannot feel pain, an anesthesiologist is regularly present at organ donation surgical procedures.&lt;ref name="Gross, 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gross|first1=Terry|title=Blurring the Lines between Life and Death|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/19/148296627/blurring-the-line-between-life-and-death|website=National Public Radio|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the results of the apnea test if a person lacks the brain function to breathe unassisted, it is concluded that it would also lack the brain function to relay the sensation of pain.&lt;ref name="Gross, 2012"/&gt; The anesthesiologist's main role is to ensure that muscle spasms or reflexes do not occur during the procedure. Though the brain may be dead, the pathway that reflexes follow does not pass from the stimulus in the body to the brain. Instead the spinal cord coordinates the knee-jerk reactions of reflexes including pulling back from the pain of putting a hand in an open flame or jerking away from an invasive incision. When the brain is dead these pathways remain intact and the anesthesiologist is present to ensure that these reactions do not complicate the procedure.&lt;ref name="Gross, 2012"/&gt;

==Brain death and pregnancy==
{{Main|Maternal somatic support after brain death}}
Pregnancy can be prolonged after brain death. It is then possible to deliver the baby by means of caesarian section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 2761925| year = 1989| author1 = Bernstein| first1 = I. M.| title = Maternal brain death and prolonged fetal survival| journal = Obstetrics and gynecology| volume = 74| issue = 3 Pt 2| pages = 434–7| last2 = Watson| first2 = M| last3 = Simmons| first3 = G. M.| last4 = Catalano| first4 = P. M.| last5 = Davis| first5 = G| last6 = Collins| first6 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cadavers have been reported to support a fetus for a period of 107 days.  After delivering the baby, some cadavers have subsequently become organ donors.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powner|first1=DJ|last2=Bernstein|first2=IM|title=Extended somatic support for pregnant women after brain death|journal=Critical Care Medicine|date=April 2003|volume=31|issue=4|pages=1241–9|pmid=12682499|doi=10.1097/01.ccm.0000059643.45027.96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1981 there have been 22 recorded instances of keeping a mother declared brain dead in a beating heart cadaver state until the baby is delivered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A review of 11 of these unique circumstance pregnancies was conducted in 2000. Four of these cases involved a persistent vegetative state of the mother and in 7 maternal brain death was diagnosed.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feldman|first=D|date=2000|title=Irreversible Maternal Brain Injury During Pregnancy: A Case Report and Review of Literature|url=|journal=Obstetrical &amp; Gynecological Survey|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women that underwent these gestation periods all delivered preterm an average of 30.5 weeks, where a normal pregnancy is around 35 weeks for full term.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; The mothers were observed to have severe hypotension once in the brain dead or vegetative state and in all but one case the baby was delivered by cesarian section. It has also been found that by the 24th week of pregnancy intensive care is not as necessary and the mother is more stable than treatment occurring before the 24th week.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Common complications involved inability to regulate temperature which is treated with heating and cooling blankets, as well as failure of the endocrine system which is important in maintaining a stable fetal environment.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Following the delivery of the baby, organs of the mother are harvested as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

From an ethical perspective the family and next of kin are often involved in the decision to terminate or prolong the pregnancy. This can be a difficult decision given the level of care required to keep the mothers living for the duration of their gestation which can vary. Intensive care of a vegetative state patient is not usually advised due to the dismal chances of recovery, but in the case that the fetus could survive this care is often justified and administered at the discretion of the family.&lt;ref name="Gross, 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Intense counseling and advisement by physicians and neonatal experts often accompanies these rare situations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Ethical debate==
Brain death is defined loosely as the inability to breathe on one's own, with irreversible brain damage.&lt;ref name="Gross, 2012"/&gt; The use of the term "beating heart cadaver" stemmed from the idea that a person considered brain dead no longer has the legal rights of a "patient" and should not be referred to as such.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When doctors take away ventilation systems and patients fail to breathe, move, or show any signs of arousal on their own they are considered brain dead.&lt;ref name="Gross, 2012"/&gt; This test is called an apnea test. The ventilator is taken away and is reconnected only if the person decided to be an organ donor. This definition can create some cognitive dissonance because not responding to stimulation may show a problem with the central nervous system, yet when someone has a beating heart and lungs that will still function with the help of a ventilator it is difficult for some to consider that true death. Brain death patients have characteristics of the living and the dead.&lt;ref name="Zamperetti, 2003" /&gt;

===Social issues===
Organ recovery from beating heart cadavers has remained ambiguous to the public. There is a guideline for organ transplantation consisting of two parts. It states that organ donors must be dead before removing the organs, and removing the organs is not the cause of death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potts|first1=Michael|title=Truthfulness in transplantation: non-heart-beating organ donation|journal=Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine|volume=2|issue=1|year=2007|pages=17|issn=1747-5341|doi=10.1186/1747-5341-2-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This clause is in place to ensure that organ donation is not exploited to use people purely as a means to an end. However, many believe that even with these guidelines in place the protocol for organ donation still has room for criticism. Negative reviews from public and medical personnel on this subject tend to stem from a lack of understanding of what it means to be considered brain dead and how these decisions are made.&lt;ref name="Bastami, 2013" /&gt; One social issue that is commonly brought up is the potential for conflict of interest for the medical team examining the body.&lt;ref name="Bastami, 2013" /&gt; Another issue raising concerns in the organ donation by beating heart cadaver field is the administration of drugs to the patient that prevent clotting prior the donation procedure. These drugs are not beneficial to the patient and are intended solely to help the recipient of the organs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; To alleviate some of these social concerns, there has been push for a standard in determining death and creating a normalized system for transplantation in these patients.&lt;ref name="Bastami, 2013" /&gt;

===Religious and cultural differences===
From a religious standpoint, the encouragement of organ donation or acceptance may vary. The Catholic church with input from [[Pope John Paul II]], identified transplantation from beating heart cadavers or living subjects as acceptable if there are no added risks to the donor.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bruzzone, P.|date=2008|title=Religious aspects of organ transplantation|url=|journal=Transplantation Proceedings |volume=40 |pages=1064–1067|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been widely debated in [[Japan]] where the first heart transplant took place in 1968 and the patient died a few months after the procedure.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Bowman, K. |author2=Richard, S.|date=2003|title=Culture, brain death, and transplantation|url=|journal=Progress in Transplantation |volume=13 |pages=211–217|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, more transplantation procedures have taken place but it is still a controversial subject. Transplantation in naturalist religions and cultures such as Native Americans, [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and [[Confucianism|Confucianists]] tend to dissuade the use of living donors and transplantation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The body is idealized as a home for a soul and the organs belonging to a person are considered perverse if utilized by another person. No religion specifically outlaws the use of beating heart cadavers or prefers them to non beating heart cadavers.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Western cultures more widely accept the use of transplantation by beating heart cadavers than more conservative cultures.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The main concern of many religions and cultures is ensuring the body is not objectified or disrespected in harvesting and transplantation of organs.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4849">'''Cadeguala''' or ''Cadiguala''&lt;ref&gt;[[Pedro Mariño de Lobera]], CRÓNICA DEL REINO DE CHILE, Cap. XXXV: [[Diego de Rosales]], '''“Historia General del Reino de Chile”, Flandes Indiano''', Tomo II, Capítulos LII, LIII, LIV&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Mapuche]] [[toqui]] elected in 1585 following the death in battle of the previous toqui [[Nangoniel]]. Cadeguala was a noted warrior and the first Mapuche toqui known to have used [[cavalry]] successfully in battle. He was killed in a duel with the garrison commander of the [[Spain|Spanish]] fort at [[Purén]] in 1586.

While very young he entered the Mapuche army as a private, although he was a nobleman, and gradually won promotion to the grade of general. The toqui, [[Cayancaru]], gave him command of a strong army to attack the city of [[Angol]], which he did without success, but then marched to the city of [[Arauco, Chile|Arauco]], besieged and entered it. Afterward he intended to attack [[Santísima Trinidad (fort)|Fort Trinidad]], this fortress commanding the passage from [[Bio-bio River]], but a body of Spanish troops under Francisco Hernandez came out and defeated Cadeguala, who lost an arm and was otherwise severely wounded. This forced him to retire to the mountains. He was followed thither by the lieutenant-governor of Chile, who attempted an ambush, only to be discovered, defeated, and killed, with 50 of his men, 14 November 1586. On the same day Cadeguala was elected toqui by acclamation.&lt;ref name="appletons"&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Cudequala|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his election, Cadeguala began operations against the Spanish and then attacked Angol breaking into the city with the aid of sympathetic Mapuche that set fires within the town.  However the arrival of  the governor [[Alonso de Sotomayor]] inspired a counterattack by the residents that had fled to the citadel driving the Mapuche back out of the town.  Deprived of success there he followed with a siege of the Spanish fort at Purén the following year with 4,000 warriors.  After driving off a relief force led by Governor Sotomayor with his 150 lancers he offered the garrison a chance to withdraw or join his army which was refused by all but one.  He next challenged the commander of the fort, [[Alonso García de Ramón]], to single combat to decide the fate of the fortress. The two leaders fought on horseback with lances, and Cadeguala fell, killed by his opponent's weapon in the first tilt. Even when dying, the Mapuche warrior would not admit defeat, and tried in vain to mount his horse again.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt; His army raised the siege but after electing [[Guanoalca]] as toqui returned to successfully drive the poorly supplied Spanish from Purén.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2104">'''Cecilia Charlotte Asper Mettler''' was a medical historian. She was one of the first full-time, and the first female, professors of the [[history of medicine]] in the [[United States]].

Mettler was born on October 26, 1909 in [[Weehawken]], [[New Jersey]]. Her father, William Charles Asper, was a lawyer. She learned [[Latin]] at the Convent of St. Elizabeth, where she received her [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in 1931. She studied further at [[Cornell University]] where she received her [[Ph.D.]] in 1938. During this time she familiarized herself with medicine at the [[Washington University School of Nursing]] and at the [[University of Georgia]] School of Medicine, where her husband, Fred Mettler, worked. In 1939, she was named assistant professor of medical history at the University of Georgia School of Medicine. In 1941, they moved to [[New York City]], where she held a position as an associate in neurology, [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]].

She noted that medical history is typically taught either by delivering chronological lectures or by focusing on a specific topic, and proposed to correlate medical history teaching with the teaching of the medical curriculum. Her major work, ''The History of Medicine'', reflected that approach. It was completed after nine years of work just a few days before her death, and published posthumously.

Mettler died on December 1, 1943, three days after the birth of her daughter.

'''''Chupacabra vs. The Alamo''''' is a 2013 [[Television film|made-for-TV movie]] about a pack of [[Chupacabra]] that use a tunnel to escape from Mexico to San Antonio, Texas. In their travels, however, they engage in many violent attacks. They begin to kill local residents and various drug cartel members.

The film stars [[Erik Estrada]] and [[Julia Benson]] as the protagonists. It was directed by [[Terry Ingram]] with the story by [[Peter Sullivan (screenwriter)|Peter Sullivan]] and [[Jeffrey Schenck]]. The movie was released in the U.S. and Canada initially and then later in Brazil and Germany under the titles ''Chupacabra'' and ''Chupacabra - Angriff der Killerbestien''.

== Plot ==
A group of corpses are found in a tunnel, where they were attacked and killed by Chupacabras. The following day, Carlos Seguin ([[Erik Estrada]]) and Tracy Taylor ([[Julia Benson]]) begin to investigate the killings and discover a dying man who has also been attacked by the Chupacabras. The dying man identifies his killers as "Diablo" (Spanish for the Devil).

Tracy soon discovers a pile of bones deeper within the tunnel. A Chupacabra attacks Tracy, but she is able to kill it and the dead body is then taken back to a lab to study.

Later in the film, Agent Perez ([[Aleks Paunovic]]), one of Seguin's partners, is searching the field with his dog. Both are eventually killed by a pack of Chupacabras. Before the man is killed, he takes a picture of one of the Chupacabras, which Carlos later finds while investigating the murders.

The Chupacabras attack a group of teenagers during a [[Cinco de Mayo]] party, forcing Sienna ([[Nicole Muñoz]]), Carlos' daughter and one of her friends to hide inside the school. They are able to call Carlos, who is able to shoot the Chupacabras. However, later while they are recovering in their home, another pack of Chupacabras attacks, this time injuring Sienna and killing her friend, Brooke.

After being relieved by his boss, Carlos enlists the aid of his son's gang. One of his agent friends, Wilcox ([[Zak Santiago]]) also comes up to help with a tactical team. Using the signal from a transponder that Taylor tagged unto one of the Chupacabras, the group trace the pack of monsters into a nearby warehouse. However, they end up being ambushed by the Chupacabras with most of the tactical team being killed.

In the climax, Carlos and the group of survivors lead the Chupacabras to the [[Alamo]], where a battle takes place. In the end, they kill all the Chupacabras by blowing up the Alamo.

'''Colin Campbell Eadie Ross''' (11 October 1892 – 24 April 1922) was an [[Australia]]n wine-bar owner convicted of the murder of a child, which became known as the [[Gun Alley Murder]], and [[capital punishment|executed]] despite evidence that he was innocent. Following his execution, efforts were made to clear his name, but it was not until the 1990s that the key evidence was re-examined using modern [[forensic science|forensic techniques]], strongly indicating that Ross was innocent. As a result, an appeal for mercy was made to Victoria's [[Chief Justice]] in 2006, and on 27 May 2008 the [[Governor of Victoria]] pardoned Ross, in what is believed to be an Australian legal first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silvester|first=John|title=Ross cleared of murder nearly 90 years ago|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/bcrimeb-man-cleared-of-murder-86-years-after-he-was-executed/2008/05/26/1211653938453.html|accessdate=2012-09-24|newspaper=The Age|date=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Colin Ross was born in [[North Fitzroy]], [[Melbourne]], the third of five children born to Thomas and Elizabeth Ross. Thomas Ross died in 1900 leaving his wife to care for the five young children, including one who was newborn.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, pp. 110-111&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, none of the children were well educated, each one leaving school as early as possible to find work to help support the family. Colin Ross began working at a local quarry at the age of 11, and over the following years he worked as a labourer and later as a wardsman at the [[Broadmeadows]] army hospital. In 1920, Elizabeth Ross became the manager of the [[Donnybrook, Victoria|Donnybrook Hotel]], 30 kilometres north of Melbourne, with Colin as partner and another of her sons, Ronald, as licensee.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Colin Ross began a relationship with Lily Mae Brown, who worked in a Melbourne hotel. On 5 March 1920, Ross asked Brown to marry him, and when she refused, he produced a revolver. He followed her onto a tram, where he continued to threaten her, until she agreed to meet him later in the day. Instead, she contacted the police and a plain-clothes detective was present when she kept her appointment with Ross later in the evening. Ross was charged with using threatening words and for carrying firearms without permission. On the charge of using threatening words he was sentenced to 14 days imprisonment, along with a 12-month good behaviour bond, and was fined for carrying the firearm.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, pp. 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 1921 the Ross family returned to Melbourne, where Colin Ross, with his brothers Stanley and Ronald, bought a wine shop in the Eastern Arcade, in the business centre of Melbourne. After the purchase of the shop, renamed "The Australian Wine Saloon", the Ross brothers continued the employment of its barmaid, Ivy Matthews. She later commented that the saloon had previously attracted a quiet and respectable clientele, but that the Ross brothers were willing to serve anyone, with the result that it was soon frequented by alcoholics and criminals. Other tenants in the building resented the intrusion of the wine bar's customers, who reportedly drank to excess, vomited and urinated in the arcade, and made lewd comments to passing women.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 October 1921, one of the saloon's customers was robbed in the outdoor lavatory of the premises, and was shot during a struggle with his assailant. His wound was not serious, but he was unable to give an account of events to police due to the large amount of alcohol he had consumed. An investigation revealed that his assailant was a young English traveller, Frank Walsh, who had spent most of his money, and who had been approached by Colin Ross to rob the customer on the understanding that the proceeds would be shared between them. Ross and Walsh were arrested and charged with armed robbery. Ross's comments to police incriminated Ivy Matthews, who had until that point refused to discuss the matter. Following a visit by Elizabeth Ross, Matthews began to speak on Ross's behalf, and at the same time began referring to herself as the saloon's manager, and drawing money from the saloon's account. Ross made no further attempt to draw Matthews to the attention of police.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; He was acquitted of the armed robbery charge, but Walsh was sentenced to six months hard labour.&lt;ref name=Morgan120&gt;Morgan, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Following Colin Ross's acquittal, Stanley Ross confronted Ivy Matthews and dismissed her from her position.&lt;ref name=Morgan120/&gt;

==Victim==
Nell Alma Tirtschke, known as Alma, was born in 14 March 1909 at a remote mining settlement in [[Western Australia]], the first child of Charles Tirtschke and Nell Alger.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1911, Charles Tirtschke accepted a position with a mining company in [[Zimbabwe|Rhodesia]] (now Zimbabwe), and the family moved there, where Nell gave birth to a second daughter, Viola, in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;  The family was returning to Australia in December 1914, when Nell died of complications relating to a third pregnancy and was buried at sea.&lt;ref name=Morgan212&gt;Morgan, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;  After arriving in Melbourne, Charles Tirtschke was unable to care for the children, and returned to Western Australia where he worked on the goldfields. Alma and Viola were cared for by their grandparents, Henry and Elizabeth Tirschke, who were assisted by their five adult daughters.&lt;ref name=Morgan212/&gt;

By 1921, Henry Tirschke had died, and the grandmother assumed all parental duties. She was remembered by Viola as a strict disciplinarian who kept a close watch on both daughters. Alma was studious and well behaved, and excelled in her studies at the Hawthorn West Central School. However her grandmother greatly restricted her from social activities with other students, and she became very shy. An uncle, John Murdoch, said of Alma Tirschke, "Though of a bright disposition, she was somewhat reserved, and did not make friends readily like some girls. She lacked the vivacious manner that encourages chance acquaintance".&lt;ref name=Morgan219&gt;Morgan, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Her sister Viola described her as being "soft in speech and soft in manner".&lt;ref name=Morgan219/&gt;

==Murder==
On the afternoon of 30 December 1921, Alma's grandmother sent the twelve-year-old on an errand. She was to collect a package of meat from a butcher's shop in [[Swanston Street, Melbourne]], and take it a short distance to [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]] to deliver it to her aunt. The errand should have taken no more than 15 minutes and when Alma, who was known to be reliable and obedient, failed to return home, her grandmother became alarmed. She was reported as missing, and the police, along with the Tirtschke family, searched for Alma through the night. Early the next morning, her naked body was found in Gun Alley, a laneway off Little Collins Street, near the address Alma had been sent to. She had been raped and strangled.

The case became a major sensation, with the Melbourne press convincing its readers that a maniac was on the loose and likely to strike again. A reward of 1250 pounds ($91,500 in 2013 dollars) was offered for the capture of the killer; one of the highest rewards offered in Australia at that time. As time passed with no real progress, the police were criticised, and were subjected to public pressure to make an arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lack, John|first=&amp; Morgan, Kevin|title=Ross, Colin Campbell Eadie (1892–1922)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/ross-colin-campbell-eadie-13175|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigations revealed that Alma had last been seen alive between 2:30pm and 3:00pm on the afternoon of her disappearance, at the corner of Alfred Place and Little Collins Streets, near the lane in which her body was subsequently discovered and that she had been murdered at around 6:00pm. Among the numerous men interviewed was Colin Ross, the saloon manager, who described seeing a girl matching Alma's description, outside his saloon. His description of events closely matched that of several witnesses who had also seen her. Several witnesses recounted how Alma looked worried with one stating that a man (not Colin Ross) was following her.

Ross was obviously well known to the local police, having recently been acquitted on the charge relating to his alleged involvement in the shooting and robbing of one of his customers. Despite Ross's willingness to co-operate, police began to interview him in greater detail. He was able to nominate several witnesses who had seen him tending his saloon on the afternoon of Alma's death and who would confirm that he had not left the premises, but the police remained convinced that he had killed Alma, and on 12 January 1922 they arrested him for murder.

==Trial==
The public fascination with the case intensified as newspapers published news of Ross' arrest, but Ross told his lawyers, family and friends that he had nothing to fear. As an innocent man, he said, it was only a matter of time before he would be released.

The trial began on 20 February 1922 and witnesses were produced to attest to Ross's guilt. John Harding, who had a previous conviction for perjury and was being detained in prison at the time, [[At Her Majesty's pleasure|"at the Governor's pleasure"]], testified that Ross had confided in him in prison, and had admitted his guilt. Ivy Matthews, Olive Maddox, a prostitute, and Julia Gibson, who worked as a fortune-teller under the name "Madame Gurkha", also testified in court that Ross had confessed the crime to them. The prosecution case was that 12-year-old Alma had chosen to have a drink in Ross' wine bar instead of collecting the package for her aunty and had remained there consensually from 3:00pm until 6:00pm drinking wine, at which time Ross had raped and murdered her.&lt;ref name="Cowan"/&gt;

The prosecution also offered forensic evidence in the form of several strands of hair they had obtained from Alma Tirtschke shortly before her funeral. A detective testified that on the day of Ross's arrest he had noticed several strands of "golden hair" on a blanket in Ross's house, which were later removed and examined by the state government analyst, Charles Price, who was a trained chemist, but had little previous experience in the new field of forensic science. Price testified that he compared the hairs under a microscope, and concluded that the hair found in Ross's house was a light auburn colour, while Alma's hair was a dark red. He measured the diameter of the hairs and concluded that they were of a different thickness. At one point in his testimony he commented that the hairs on Ross' blanket had most likely fallen from the head of a regular visitor, such as Ross's girlfriend, but after a long testimony, he stated that he believed the hairs were "derived from the scalp of one and same person," Alma Tirtschke. His contradictory evidence was accepted by the judge without comment.

Ross's barrister, Thomas Brennan, protested, requesting that a further examination be carried out by a more qualified person, but the judge refused. The jury found Ross guilty of murder and he was sentenced to death by hanging. His legal representatives were convinced of his innocence but found that public opinion remained strongly against Ross, and news of his death sentence was met with public celebration. Ross's legal representatives sought to obtain the right to appeal but this was refused by the judge who stated that Ross's guilt had been proven beyond doubt. Brennan sought leave to appeal to the Privy Council in England, but that application was also refused.

Brennan remained supportive of Ross and certain of his innocence, but had exhausted all avenues in his attempt to save Ross from execution. On the eve of his execution, Ross received a letter from a man who failed to give his name but admitted that he had killed Alma, and, although consumed by guilt, was not willing to come forward as it would cause grief to his family. Brennan later wrote that he believed the letter could have been authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, pp. 290&amp;ndash;291.&lt;/ref&gt; This letter may have been written by the real killer.

==Execution==
Before his execution in his farewell letter to his family, Ross wrote: '' "The day is coming when my innocence will be proved." ''

Ross composed himself with dignity for his quiet but resolute statement from the scaffold:
 
:'' "I am now face to face with my Maker, and I swear by Almighty God that I am an innocent man. I never saw the child. I never committed the crime, and I don't know who did. I never confessed to anyone. I ask God to forgive those who have sworn my life away, and I pray God to have mercy on my poor darling mother, and my family." ''

Ross was executed on 24 April 1922 at [[Melbourne Gaol]] in a particularly gruesome manner. Authorities had decided to experiment with a four-stranded rope rather than the usual three-stranded European hemp. The four-stranded rope did not run freely through the noose and Ross did not die immediately because his spinal cord was fractured, not severed. Although his windpipe was torn and obstructed by his destroyed larynx, the condemned man continued with rasping breaths and convulsed on the rope. Three times Ross bent his knees and flexed his arms before succumbing, slowly strangled to death by asphyxiation. A prison report later ruled that such a rope must never be used again.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, pp. 260&amp;ndash;261.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempts to clear name==
Thomas Brennan became consumed with his failure to save the life of Colin Ross, eventually writing a book, ''The Gun Alley Tragedy'', in which he attempted to establish that Ross had been hanged for a crime he did not commit. Although Brennan attracted supporters, it was not enough to persuade the Victorian government to have the case re-examined, and over the following years, interest began to wane among all but the most ardent of Ross's supporters.

In 1993, Kevin Morgan, a former school teacher, became interested in Ross' case, and began to research the events surrounding the murder of Alma Tirtschke and Ross's execution. He read handwritten notes in the Bible Colin Ross had kept with him in prison, and which had been preserved by his family following his death. Morgan was moved by the simple notations in which Ross wrote of false witnesses, knowing that Ross had written these notes without expecting anyone else to read them.

Morgan examined interview records and court transcripts, and discovered information that had been kept from the court at the time, including the testimony of six reliable witnesses who placed Ross inside his saloon for the entire afternoon of Alma Tirtschke's murder. Furthermore, a cab driver, Joseph Graham, had heard screams coming from a building in Collins Street at 3.00 p.m., during the time that Ross was verified as having been in the saloon. Graham's interview had been disregarded by police and he had not been called to give evidence. Following Ross's arrest, Graham attempted to have his story told through a solicitor, but was not permitted to present his version of events in court. Morgan also noted that the witnesses against Ross were of dubious character and could have been motivated to present false testimony; John Harding's sentence was reduced after he stated that Ross had confessed to him in prison while Olive Maddox, the prostitute, Ivy Matthews, the disgruntled former employee and Julia Gibson, the fortune-teller, had shared the reward money. A closer examination of the long testimony of Charles Price regarding the hair samples seemed to support Ross's innocence.

Two years after he began researching the case, Kevin Morgan found a file in the [[Director of Public Prosecutions|Office of Public Prosecutions]] containing the original hair samples, which had been thought lost. He began a long administrative struggle for the right to submit the hair samples for DNA testing, finally achieving his aim in 1998. Two independent scientific authorities - the [[Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine]] and the forensics division of the [[Australian Federal Police]] - found that the two lots of hair did not come from the same person, thereby disproving with certainty the most damning piece of evidence presented at Colin Ross's trial.

On 4 October 2005, the families of both Colin Ross and Alma Tirtschke submitted a petition of mercy. On 23 October 2006 the Victorian [[Attorney General]] [[Rob Hulls]] forwarded the 31-page petition to the Chief Justice, Marilyn Warren, requesting her to consider the plea for Ross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.vic.gov.au/resources/adeda430-db22-4e27-b96b-477c6a5c7e06/opinion+-+colin+campbell+ross.pdf R v Colin Campbell Ross] Supreme Court of Victoria December 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
The subsequent pardon, granted on 27 May 2008, is the first example of a posthumous pardon in Victoria's legal history and is to date the only instance of a pardon for a judicially executed person in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Morgan (2012) ''Gun Alley: Murder, Lies and Failure of Justice'' (2nd ed., updated). Hardie Grant Books (Australia) Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family of Alma Tirtschke are relieved that Ross has finally been exonerated. In a [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]] Radio interview discussing the pardon, the murdered girl's second cousin recounted how her grandmother was preoccupied with the murder "''She didn't say who was the right man but she said the wrong man was hung''".&lt;ref name="Cowan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pardon not enough, murdered girl's relative says|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-05-27/pardon-not-enough-murdered-girls-relative-says/2450334|accessdate=2012-09-24|newspaper=ABC News|date=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview on the [[Nine Network]]'s ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' program, the family stated they believe the true murderer was a family member.&lt;ref name="Waldon" &gt;{{cite news|last=Waldon|first=Steve|title=Wrong man hanged|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/wrong-man-hanged/2005/07/08/1120704555156.html|accessdate=2012-09-24|newspaper=The Age|date=2005-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Kevin Morgan interviewed Viola, Alma's sister, and in his book revealed the probable killer to be a man mistrusted by the two girls, a returned soldier who had [[pedophilia|paedophilic]] tendencies, George Murphy, who was married to their cousin.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan (2012) pp. 357-376&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Ross trial was the first in Australasia to obtain a conviction using a scientific comparison of hairs. The case also led to the practice of anonymity for jurors after [[Keith Murdoch]]'s newspaper, [[The Herald (Melbourne)|''The Herald'']] sensationalized the case and prejudiced the trial by publishing Ross's photograph and printing the names and addresses of the jury. The Herald was shamed by other newspapers and its headquarters in Flinders Street was nicknamed "the Colin Ross Memorial" by opposition journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lack | first = John | year = 2005 | title = Ross, Colin Campbell Eadie (1892–1922) | work = Australian Dictionary of Biography | url = http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/ross-colin-campbell-eadie-13175 | accessdate = 11 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, Ross's remains were identified and handed to his family for a proper burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=VIC:Wrongly executed man laid to rest | journal=AAP News | publication-date=2010-10-16 | publisher=Financial Times Ltd | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/126056698 | accessdate=11 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Gun Alley Murder is depicted in 1982's ''[[Squizzy Taylor (film)|Squizzy Taylor]]'', a film about the eponymous Melbourne gangster. The film portrays Taylor ([[David Atkins]]) assisting the authorities with the case by intimidating supposed witnesses into revealing what they know about Ross.&lt;ref&gt;[[Squizzy Taylor (film)|Squizzy Taylor]] (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Conflict resolution strategies fall into several main categories. They each have advantages which form their rationales.&lt;ref name=Bullinaria/&gt;

#Specificity - If all of the conditions of two or more rules are satisfied, choose the rule according to how specific its conditions are. It is possible to favor either the more general or the more specific case.&lt;ref name=CMU/&gt; The most specific may be identified roughly as the one having the greatest number of preconditions. This usefully catches exceptions and other special cases before firing the more general (default) rules.&lt;ref name=Bullinaria/&gt;
#Recency - When two or more rules could be chosen, favor the one that matches the most recently added facts, as these are most likely to describe the current situation.&lt;ref name=CMU/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bullinaria/&gt;
#Not previously used - If a rule's conditions are satisfied, but previously the same rule has been satisfied by the same facts, ignore the rule.&lt;ref name=CMU/&gt; This helps to prevent the system from entering infinite loops.&lt;ref name=Bullinaria/&gt;
#Order - Pick the first applicable rule in order of presentation.&lt;ref name=CMU/&gt; This is the strategy that [[Prolog]] interpreters use by default,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brna|first1=Paul|title=Prolog and Execution Strategies|url=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pbrna/prologbook/node196.html|publisher=University of Edinburgh|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but any strategy may be implemented by building suitable rules in a Prolog system.&lt;ref name="Bratko2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bratko|first=Ivan|title=Prolog Programming for Artificial Intelligence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-15su78YRj8C&amp;pg=PA644|year=2001|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=978-0-201-40375-6|page=644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Auto racing]] is a dangerous sport by its nature and has seen a large number of deaths. The number of deaths, however, has fallen in recent years as safety standards and car construction has improved. A prime example of this is in [[Formula 1]], where deaths were a regular occurrence earlier in the history of the series but have now improved to the point where there has been only one death since 1994.&lt;ref name="memor"&gt;[http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/query.php?db=ms&amp;q=vehtype&amp;n=motorcycle MotorSportMemorial.org Motorcycle deaths (retrieved 8 November 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="f1"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/33578770 Jules Bianchi dies of injuries sustained in a crash during the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.]&lt;/ref&gt; Deaths in [[motorsport]] overall are still a tragic regular occurrence however, with [[motorcycle racing]] suffering more instances than car racing. This is largely due to the nature of [[motorcycle]] riding and lack of protection it affords a rider in the event of a crash. Deaths in motorsport can be categorised as follows.

==Driver deaths in motorsport==
{{main|Driver deaths in motorsport}}
This section covers all driver deaths in car or truck racing events. These have either taken place at racing cirucits or oval racing venues. Deaths in all series and in all types of vehicles are included, from club or national level series to high-profile events like [[Formula 1]] and [[Champ Car]]. 

==Rider deaths in motorcycle racing==
{{main|Rider deaths in motorcycle racing}}
This covers rider deaths in all forms of [[motorcycle racing]]. This includes all circuit and road racing events of any level. High-profile events like [[Moto GP]] and the [[Isle of Man TT]] are included alongside other international, national or club level events. 

==Driver and co-driver deaths in rallying events==
{{main|Driver and co-driver deaths in rallying events}}
[[Rallying]] is an offroad motorsport, generally featuring a number of timed stages on varying surfaces to crown an overall winner. Deaths in this form of motorsport often occur when the car leaves the road and crashes into something on the roadside or suffers a significant fall. Deaths at all levels are included, from national events to major events like the [[World Rally Championship]] and the [[Dakar Rally]]

'''Debbie Dobbins''' (October 28, 1963 – December 30, 1993) was a popular [[fitness competition|fitness competitor]] and fitness model during the early 1990s. Her life was cut short due to [[smoke inhalation]] in a house fire.

==Biography==
Dobbins was born in [[Olongapo]], [[Philippines]], of half [[Irish people|Irish]] and half [[Filipino people|Filipino]] descent. When she was three her family moved to [[Portland, Oregon]], where she grew up in the northwest side. She competed in a variety of sports in high school and college, including [[track and field]] and [[basketball]]. She graduated from college with a degree in Marketing and Advertising. After college, she began taking aerobic classes, and also took up running and weight training. Later she taught aerobics and cross training for seven years, and gradually made weight training a bigger part of her fitness regimen.

Dobbins moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] at age twenty-four to pursue a career in the fitness industry.  There she became an aerobics instructor and played [[volleyball]] for [[Orange Coast College]] in [[Costa Mesa]].  While establishing herself as a fitness model she worked full-time for a leasing company, and did promotional work for [[Randy Pfund]], coach of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Debbie also worked as a cheerleader for the [[Portland Breakers]] of the [[USFL]] and [[Los Angeles Raiders]] of the [[NFL]].

Her magazine cover appearances included ''Musclemag International'' and ''[[Iron Man (magazine)|Iron Man]]''.  She was also featured in ''Iron Man'''s special swimsuit issue and modeled for ''Iron Man'' gym wear.  In 1993, Debbie placed third in the Ms. Fitness USA competition and tied for second at the Ms. Galaxy.  Her death in late 1993 occurred as a result of [[smoke inhalation]] in a house fire.

In a 1994 episode of ''Hard Copy'', it was speculated that there was foulplay involved with the fire causing her death.

The organization was founded in October 2002 following an overnight [[sit-in]] and morning blockade at the San Francisco Federal Building following the [[U.S. Congress]]'s authorization of the use of force against [[Iraq]]. Operating primarily through the use of [[affinity group]]s and a [[spokescouncil]], it coordinated a mass effort by 5,000 to 20,000 people to disrupt business in the [[Financial District, San Francisco|financial district]] of downtown [[San Francisco]] following the beginning of the war in March 2003. The organization persisted through 2004, coordinating a variety of local protests against corporations with ties to the war effort and sending hundreds of activists to protests in Cancun, [[Miami]] and [[New York City]].

The March 2003 San Francisco actions were the culmination of twenty years of urban direct action organizing. Beginning with the War Chest Tours of the early 1980s and continuing through the 1991 Gulf War and other occasions, direct activists developed the blockading and disruptive tactics that were used by thousands of protesters in opposition to the 2003 war on Iraq. The 1980s protests are documented with photos and narratives at DirectAction.org.

On Jan. 6, 2008, Direct Action to Stop the War was reconvened, with the goal of organizing several direct actions in the San Francisco Bay Area to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the Iraq War.

'''Extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances in the Philippines''' are illegal [[execution]]s{{snd}}unlawful or felonious killings{{snd}}and [[forced disappearance]]s in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111154519/http://www.radiopinoyusa.com/radiopinoy_news.php?id=NEWS-00592 radiopinoyusa.com, U.N.

Extrajudicial killings are most commonly referred to as '''"salvaging'''" in [[Philippine English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.waywordradio.org/salvage/ |title= Salvage|publisher=A Way with Words |access-date= 28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usip.org/publications/2007/03/14/extrajudicial-killings-in-the-philippines-strategies-end-the-violence|title= Extrajudicial Killings in the Philippines: Strategies to End the Violence|author = G.

Extrajudicial killings (EJKs) is also synonymous with the term "extralegal killings" (ELKs). Extrajudicial/ extralegal killings (EJKs/ ELKs) and enforced disappearances (EDs) are unique in the Philippines in as much as it is publicly and commonly known to be committed also by non-state armed groups (NAGs) such as the New Peoples Army (NPA) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Although cases have been well documented with conservative estimates of EJKs/ ELKs and EDs committed by the NPAs numbering to about 900-1,000 victims based on the discovery of numerous mass grave sites all over country, legal mechanisms for accountability of non-state actors have been weak if not wholly non-existent.

{{update|section|January 1, 2018|date=January 2018}}
Philippine extrajudicial killings are politically motivated murders committed by government officers, punished by local and [[international law]] or [[Treaty|convention]]. They include assassinations; deaths due to strafing or indiscriminate firing; massacre; [[summary execution]] is done if the victim becomes passive before the moment of death (i.e., abduction leading to death); assassination means forthwith or instant killing while [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]] is akin to [[genocide]] or mass extermination; thus, killings occurred in many regions or places throughout the Philippines in different times - 136 killings in Southern Tagalog region were recorded by human rights group [[Karapatan]] from 2001 to May 19, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/publications/summit/Summit%20Papers/ta%C3%B1ada%20-%20ending%20extrajudicial%20killings.pdf|title=www.supremecourt.gov.ph, ENDING EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS AND ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES: REFRAMING THE NATIONAL SECURITY PARADIGM AND PUTTING HUMAN RIGHTS AT THE HEART OF THE PROCESS - WIGBERTO E.

A [[forced disappearance]] (desaparecidos), on the other hand, as form of [[extrajudicial punishment]] is perpetrated by government officers, when any of its public officers abducts an individual, to vanish from public view, resulting to murder or plain [[Sequestration (law)|sequestration]]. The victim is first kidnapped, then  illegally detained in [[concentration camps]], often tortured, and finally executed and the corpse hidden. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], "disappeared people" are called ''desaparecidos'', a term which specifically refers to the mostly [[South America]]n victims of [[state terrorism]] during the 1970s and the 1980s, in particular concerning [[Operation Condor]]. In the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance]], "Enforced disappearance" is defined in Article 2 of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] as "the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx|title=redirect page|website=www.ohchr.org|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/AsiaRegion/Pages/PHIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR - Philippines Homepage|website=www.ohchr.org|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Marcos regime===
In 1995, 10,000 Filipinos won a U.S. class-suit against the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] estate. The charges were filed by victims or their surviving relatives for torture, execution and disappearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=1344412006 |title=No hero's resting place as Imelda Marcos finds site for husband's grave |author=Hrvoje Hranjski |work=The Scotsman |date=12 September 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights groups placed the number of victims of extrajudicial killings under martial law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/121365-torture-martial-law-marcos-regime|title=Worse than death: Torture methods during martial law|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at 1500 and over 800 abductions; [[Karapatan]] (a local human rights group's) records show 759 involuntarily disappeared (their bodies never found). Military historian [[Alfred W. McCoy|Alfred McCoy]] in his book "Closer than Brothers: Manhood at the Philippine Military Academy" and in his speech "Dark Legacy" cites 3,257 extrajudicial killings, 35,000 torture victims, and 70,000 incarcerated during the Marcos years.&lt;ref name="hartford-hwp.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/54a/062.html|title=Alfred McCoy, Dark Legacy: Human rights under the Marcos regime|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bulatlat.com/news/6-32/6-32-power.htm |title=Marcos Kin, Allies Still within Corridors of Power |work=Bulatalat |author=Alexander Martin Remollino |date=September 17, 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper "Bulatlat" places the number of victims of arbitrary arrest and detention at 120,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bulatlat.com/news/6-32/6-32-specter.htm |title=The Specter of Martial Law |work=Bulatalat |author=Benjie Oliveros |date=September 17, 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080105131654/http://news.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2809885 scotsman.com, No hero's resting place as Imelda Marcos finds site for husband's grave] (archived from [http://news.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2809885 the original] on 2008-01-05)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2007/10/01/18450919.php|title=Memoirs of Martial Law in the Philippines : Indybay|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New People's Army]] (NPA) groups known as "Sparrow Units" were active in the mid-1980s, killing government officials, police personnel, military members, and anyone else they targeted for elimination. They were also part of an NPA operation called "Agaw Armas" ([[Filipino language|Filipino]] for "Stealing Weapons"), where they raided government armories as well as stealing weapons from slain military and police personnel. A low level civil war with south [[Muslims]], [[Al-Qaeda]] sympathizers and [[communist]] insurgents has led to a general break down of [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]. The [[Politics of the Philippines#National Government of the Philippines|Philippines government]] has promised to curb the killings, but is itself implicated in many of the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinoyhr.net/|title=Supporters of Marijuana Legalization|website=Supporters of Marijuana Legalization|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060107160314/http://www.philippinerevolution.net/index.shtml  philippinerevolution.net, website, CCP] (archived from [http://www.philippinerevolution.net/index.shtml the original] on 2006-01-07)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070105153252/http://www.philippinerevolution.net/npa/index.shtml  philippinerevolution.net, website NPA] (archived from [http://www.philippinerevolution.net/npa/index.shtml the original] on 2007-01-05)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1975, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) was deeply concerned in politics. Because of the armed conflict, the military continued its campaign versus the New People's Army of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP). Since 1969 it aimed to establish a Marxist regime with armed rebellion against the government. On top of all these chaos, left-wing non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were/are critical of the [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] administration. The members who associated with the CPP and NPA had been targeted as victims in the spate of political killings. [[Human Rights Watch]] investigated extrajudicial murders in the Philippines in September 2007.&lt;ref name="hartford-hwp.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/asia-pacific/048/05.html|title=Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions&lt;br&gt;In the Philippines, 2001-2006  - ヒューライツ大阪|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcij.org/blog/wp-docs/karapatan_2007_hr_report.pdf  www.pcij.org, Karapatan’s 2007 human rights report] {{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three major investigation groups were commissioned and their final reports had been submitted and published: the [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] government-appointed bodies: a) Task Force Usig created by her on August; as a special police body, it was assigned to solve 10 cases of killings; it claimed having solved 21 cases, by initiating court cases, but only 12 suspects were arrested; b) the Melo Commission (chaired by Supreme Court Associate Justice Jose Melo) with members National Bureau of Investigation Director Nestor Mantaring, Chief State Prosecutor Jovencito Zuño, Bishop Juan de dios Pueblos, and Nelia Torres Gonzales; its final report states: "There is no official or sanctioned policy on the part of the military or its civilian superiors to resort to what other countries euphemistically call "alternative procedures"{{snd}}meaning illegal executions. However, there is certainly evidence pointing the finger of suspicion at some elements and personalities in the armed forces, in particular General [[Jovito Palparan]], as responsible for an undetermined number of killings, by allowing, tolerating, and even encouraging the killings."

==Remedies==

===Malacañang's peace summit and Puno's killings summit===
* Because of the magnitude of Philippine killings and desaparecidos, 22nd [[Chief Justice]] [[Reynato Puno]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] called a National Consultative Summit on extrajudicial killings on July 16 and 17, 2007 at the [[Manila Hotel]]. Invited representatives from the branches of the government participated (including the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], the PNP, [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)]], media, [[academe]], [[civil society]] and other stakeholders). On the other hand, the [[Malacañang]]-sponsored "Mindanao Peace and Security Summit" (July 8–10, 2007 at [[Cagayan de Oro City]]) concentrated on the anti-terror law, or the Human Security Act (HSA) of 2007, to make it more acceptable to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=75094|title=Inquirer.net, SC slates summit on extrajudicial killings|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708181922/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=75094|archivedate=8 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/49959/SC-slates-summit-on-extrajudicial-killings|title=SC slates summit on extrajudicial killings|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the July 16 summit, Reynato Puno stated that he Commission on Human Rights reported the number of victims at 403 from 2001 to May 31, 2007, while [[Karapatan]] reported 863 deaths&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/talkofthetown/view_article.php?article_id=78036 |title=Inquirer Opinion - Inquirer Opinion |publisher= |accessdate=15 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605022710/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/talkofthetown/view_article.php?article_id=78036 |archivedate=5 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2007, and more than 900 as of May, 2008, and most of them were members of left wing groups.

===Promulgation of Writs of Amparo and Habeas Data===
Because of the inefficacy and insufficiency of the Philippines [[Writ of Habeas Corpus]], on September 25, 2007, Chief Justice Reynato Puno signed and released the Writ of Amparo: "This rule will provide the victims of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances the protection they need and the promise of vindication for their rights. This rule empowers our courts to issue reliefs that may be granted through judicial orders of protection, production, inspection and other relief to safeguard one's life and liberty The writ of amparo shall hold public authorities, those who took their oath to defend the constitution and enforce our laws, to a high standard of official conduct and hold them accountable to our people.

===International groups' 2006 and 2008 probe of killings===
In 2006, the Dutch Lawyers for Lawyers Foundation and Lawyers without Borders with the support of the Netherlands Bar Association, the Amsterdam Bar Association and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers created a fact-finding mission in different parts of the Philippines. The international groups conducted interviews of various legal sectors from June 15 to June 20, 2006.

From November 4–12, 2008, the Dutch Lawyers for Lawyers Foundation will conduct a follow-up verification and fact finding mission (IVFFM) in Manila and [[Mindanao]], with the National Host Committee, National Union of Peoples' Lawyers (NUPL) and the Counsels for the Defense of Liberties (CODAL). This team is composed of 8 judges and lawyers from [[Belgium]] and [[Netherlands]], who had dialogue with [[Reynato Puno]] on the probe of killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindanaoexaminer.com/news.php?news_id=20081103210751|title=mindanaoexaminer.com, Human Rights Fact-Finding Mission Begins In The Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122174237/http://www.mindanaoexaminer.com/news.php?news_id=20081103210751|archive-date=2016-01-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International criticism===
On September 28, 2007, the [[Asian Human Rights Commission]] (AHRC) criticized the [[Writ of Amparo and Habeas Data (Philippines)]] for being insufficient: "Though it responds to practical areas it is still necessary that further action must be taken in addition to this. The legislative bodies, [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] and [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]], should also initiate its own actions promptly and without delay. They must enact laws which ensure protection of rights—laws against torture and [[enforced disappearance]] and laws to afford adequate legal remedies to victims." AHRC objected since the [[writ]] failed to protect non-witnesses, even if they too face threats or risk to their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/62409/Writ-of-amparo-not-enough--Hong-Kong-rights-group|title=Writ of amparo not enough – Hong Kong rights group|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reports - the root cause of killings==

===Alston UN report===
* [[Philip Alston]] submitted his final report on the killings; he found that the Armed Forces of the Philippines killed left-wing activists to get rid of communist insurgents: "the executions had "eliminated civil society leaders, including human rights defenders, trade unionists and land reform advocates, intimidated a vast number of civil society actors, and narrowed the country’s political discourse." Alston denied for lack of merit the government's claim that killings were perpetrated by communists to exterminate spies and to make negative propaganda versus government. Alston, in February 2007 stated that the military made alibis or denials on its role about 800 deaths of activists and journalists since 2001. Alston blamed "impunity" which caused the executions of journalists and leftist activists: "the priorities of the criminal justice system had been "distorted," and had "increasingly focused on prosecuting civil society leaders rather than their killers." But Alston noted the government's creation of{{snd}}special courts to try extrajudicial killings, the Melo Commission and the Philippine National Police's Task Force Usig.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080125073614/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=103513 newsinfo.inquirer.net, Alston report: AFP behind killings, Report rejects RP claim of Red purge] (archived from [http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=103513 the original] on 2008-01-25)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080507174217/http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/about/people.html Philip Alston, UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions] (archived from [http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/about/people.html#alston the original] on 2008-05-07&lt;!-- data retrieval error being reported as of 2010-12-10--&gt;)&lt;/ref&gt; In the November U.N. Alston report - the killings in 2007 was only 68, huge drop from the 209 murdered in 2006.

===Failed investigations and prosecutions===
*The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Execution found that just on paper trails, cases are filed; but Alston officially concluded that “there is a passivity, bordering on an abdication of responsibility, which affects the way in which key institutions and actors approach their responsibilities in relation to such human rights concerns; prosecutors refused to take a role in gathering evidence, and instead being purely passive, waiting for the police to present them with a file; the Ombudsman’s office did almost nothing in recent years in this regard, failing to act in any of the 44 complaints alleging extrajudicial executions attributed to State agents submitted from 2002 to 2006."

===Eric G. John and G. Eugene Martin testimonies===
* On March 14, 2007, Eric G. John, Deputy Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs testified before the USA Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations at [[Washington, D.C.]] John submitted his written statement: a) the increase in extrajudicial killings, b) the “Huk Rebellion” in the 1940s and 50s causing thousands of murdered victims; c) the communist New People's Army (NPA), which was listed in the [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations]] campaigned to overthrow the government since 1968; d) Extrajudicial killings by the security forces, the NPA, etc. during the Marcos regime, were less; and e) noted the report of UN Special Rapporteur Alston which submitted the Philippine Government's recognition of the gravity of the problem, expresses concern about the views of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) regarding the problem, but much had to submitted that the reforms made did not and will not resolve the killings. Mr. Alston's March report stated that "the question of resources or technical expertise will partly resolve the killings but the strong risk is that these measures will treat only some of the symptoms of the crisis, and will fail to address meaningfully two of the most important underlying causes of a great many of the killings." (A/HRC/4/20/Add.3, March 22, 2007) Alston named two root causes of the killings: (1) 'vilification', 'labeling’, or 'guilt by association'{{snd}}"characterization of most groups on the left of the political spectrum as ‘front organizations’ for armed groups whose aim is to destroy democracy" making the groups "considered to be legitimate targets; and (2) the Government’s counter-insurgency strategy's extent of facilitating killings of activists and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alrc.net/doc/mainfile.php/alrc_statements/453/|title=[ALRC Joint Statement] PHILIPPINES: Extrajudicial killings|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usip.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usip.org/congress/testimony/2007/0314_martin.html|title=www.usip.org, Briefings and Congressional Testimony - Testimony of G.

Eugene Martin specifically expanded the 2 causes of the violence and killings: a) weak political and social institutions, corrupt and ineffective judicial system, resulting to failure to obtain justice from corrupt Philippine courts; and b) the legacy of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] regime; [[Martial law]] caused the corrupt system where soldiers, police, judges and prosecutors became principals of offenses like extralegal arrest, detention, incarceration, disappearances and killings (salvaging), all permitted or allowed. He traced the spate of violence and killings to political instability of President Arroyo government; while she created the Independent Commission to Address Media and Activist Killings, Melo Commission, she had no capability to end the killings, due to her political lameness because of the 2004 election controversy.&lt;ref name="usip.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usip.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080801144003/https://www.senate.gov/~foreign/hearings/2007/hrg070314p.html www.senate.gov, Extrajudicial Killings In The Philippines: Strategies To End The Violence] (archived from [https://www.senate.gov/~foreign/hearings/2007/hrg070314p.html the original] on 2008-08-01)&lt;/ref&gt;

===FIDH report===
* Three experts from the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (abbreviated ''FIDH''), Mr. Nabeel Rajab (Bahrain), Mr. Mouloud Boumghar (France) and Mr. Frédéric Ceuppens (Belgium), came to the Philippines on August 13 to 23, 2007. Their FIDH mission report stated that torture and ill-treatment was widespread versus suspected "terrorists". The Filipino government is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the UN Convention against Torture (CAT). The FIDH dismissed the Philippines government's claim doubts that mechanisms were placed to stop the killings, as it questioned the efficiency of{{snd}}the corrupt judiciary, the government “Witness Protection Programme” ; also, judges and lawyers were victims themselves of killings. It also found the Philippine anti-terrorism law ( “Human Security Act”) to result in more torture and extrajudicial killings as a fight against terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/philippines-mission.pdfwww.fidh.org,|title=Philippines International Fact-Finding Mission|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2017}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial corruption===
On January 25, 2005, and on December 10, 2006, Philippines [[Social Weather Stations]] released the results of its two surveys on corruption in the judiciary; it published that: a) like 1995, 1/4 of lawyers said many/very many judges are corrupt. But (49%) stated that a judges received bribes, just 8% of lawyers admitted they reported the [[bribery]], because they could not prove it. [Tables 8-9]; judges, however, said, just 7% call many/very many judges as corrupt[Tables 10-11];b) "Judges see some corruption; proportions who said - many/very many corrupt judges or justices: 17% in reference to RTC judges, 14% to MTC judges, 12% to Court of Appeals justices, 4% i to Shari'a Court judges, 4% to [[Sandiganbayan]] justices and 2% in reference to Supreme Court justices [Table 15].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sws.org.ph/pr061210.htm |title=SWS Media Release: 6 July 2006 |publisher= |accessdate=15 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517073044/http://www.sws.org.ph/pr061210.htm |archivedate=17 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sws.org.ph/pr050125.htm |title=SWS Media Release |publisher= |accessdate=15 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517072913/http://www.sws.org.ph/pr050125.htm |archivedate=17 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FSL Kode constructs with all these aforementioned features are also known as Kode Constructs.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; The process of modifying surfaces with FSL Kode constructs is known as "koding" and the resultant "koded" [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s,&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; [[virus]]es and [[liposome]]s are respectively known as [[kodecytes]],&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2009" /&gt; and [[kodevirions]]&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt;.

==Technology description==

All [[Cell membrane|living surfaces]] are decorated with a diverse range of complex molecules, which are key modulators of [[Cell signaling|chemical communications]] and other functions such as protection, [[Cell adhesion|adhesion]], [[infectivity]], [[apoptosis]], etc. Functional-Spacer-Lipid (FSL) Kode constructs can be [[Chemical synthesis|synthesized]] to mimic the bioactive components present on biological surfaces, and then re-present them in novel ways.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;

The architecture of an FSL Kode construct, as implicit in the name, consists of three components - a functional head group, a spacer, and a lipid tail.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This structure is analogous to a [[Lego minifigure]] in that, they have three structural components, with each component having a separate purpose.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; In the examples shown in all the figures, a Lego '[[minifig]]' has been used for the analogy. However, it should be appreciated that this is merely a representation and the true structural similarity is significantly varied between Lego minifigures and FSL Kode constructs ''(fig 1)''. The functional group of an FSL is equivalent to a Lego minifigure head, with both being at the extremity and carrying the character functional components. The spacer of the FSL is equivalent to the body of the Lego minifigure and the arms on the minifigure are representative of substitutions which may be engineered into the chemical makeup of the spacer. The lipid of the FSL anchors it to lipid membranes and gives the FSL construct its [[amphiphile|amphiphatic]] nature which can cause it to self-assemble. Because the lipid tail can act directly as an anchor it is analogous to the legs of a Lego minifigure.

==Flexible design==
The functional group, the spacer and the lipid tail components of the FSL Kode construct can each be individually designed resulting in FSL Kode constructs with specific biological functions.&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; The functional head group is usually the bioactive component of the construct and the various spacers and lipids influence and effect its presentation, orientation and location on a surface. Critical to the definition of an FSL Kode construct is the requirement to be [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersible]] in water, and spontaneously and stably incorporate into cell membranes. Other lipid [[Bioconjugation|bioconjugates]] that include components similar to FSLs but do not have these features are not termed as Function-Spacer-Lipid Kode constructs.&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;

As indicated in the figure, the function group analogous to the minifigures head can be arranged in different substances, the spacer analogous to the body of the minifigure (including the arms) can have a variety of different features, and the lipid or minifigure legs can be a variety of different lipids. Together the three components of function, spacer &amp; lipid represent the FSL construct.

''Note 2: Mass – the mass that can be anchored by an FSL Kode constructs can range from 200 to &gt;1x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Dalton (unit)|Da]]''

===Spacers&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;===
The spacer is an integral part of the FSL Kode construct and gives it several important characteristics including water [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersibility]].&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;
* '''Length''' – the spacer can be varied in length, for example 1.9&amp;nbsp;nm (Ad), 7.2&amp;nbsp;nm (CMG2), 11.5&amp;nbsp;nm (CMG4),&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; allowing for enhanced presentation of Functional groups at the biosurface.
* '''Optimizes 'F' presentation''' – The presentation of the bioactive (functional group) on a spacer reduces [[steric hindrance]] and increases the bioactive surfaces exposed and available for interactions
* '''Rigidity''' – the spacer can be modified to be either flexible or rigid depending upon desired characteristics
* '''Substitutions''' (represented by the leaves on the stalk) – the spacer can be modified both in [[charge (chemistry)|charge]], and [[Chemical polarity|polarity]].
* '''Branches''' – usually the spacer is linear, but it can also be branched including specific spacing of the branches to optimize presentation and interaction of the F group.
* '''Inert''' – important to the design of FSL Kode constructs is the biologically inert nature of the spacer. Importantly this feature means the S-L components of the constructs are unreactive with undiluted serum. Consequently, the constructs are compatible ''[[in vivo]]'' use, and can improve diagnostic assay sensitivity by allowing for the use of undiluted serum.

===Lipids&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;===
The [[lipid]] tail is essential for enabling [[lipid membrane]] insertion and retention but also for giving the construct [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]] characteristics that enable [[hydrophilic]] surface coating (due to formation of [[bilipid layer]]s). Different [[Lipid bilayer|membrane lipids]] that can be used to create FSLs have different membrane physiochemical characteristics and thus can affect biological function of the FSL. Lipids in FSL Kode constructs include:&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;
* '''Diacyl/diakyl''' e.g. DOPE
* '''Sterols''' e.g. cholesterol 
* '''Ceramides'''

The first four examples show [[monomer]]ic presentation of F, with the first example representing the short 1.9nm (Ad) spacer (the flower stalk). The second and fourth with the longer stalks (spacers) representing the CMG2 7.2nm spacer and CMG4 11.5nm spacers respectively. The second and third constructs have the same spacers, but the lipid tail of the third construct is [[cholesterol]], rather than [[Phospholipid#Phospholipid derivatives|DOPE]]. 
The last three examples all based on CMG2 spacers (stalks), with a DOPE lipid tail (roots) are multimeric presentations of F. The first of these is a simple duplication of the F group, while the following has an additional spacer between the F groups. The final construct is a cluster presentation.
}}

One of the important functions of an FSL construct is that it can optimise the presentation of [[antigen]]s, both on cell surfaces and solid-phase membranes. This optimisation is achieved primarily by the spacer, and secondarily by the lipid tail. In a typical [[immunoassay]], the antigen is deposited directly onto the [[microplate]] surface and binds to the surface either in a random fashion, or in a preferred orientation depending on the residues present on the surface of this antigen. Usually this deposition process is uncontrolled. In contrast, the FSL Kode construct bound to a microplate presents the antigen away from the surface in an orientation with a high level of exposure to the environment. Furthermore, typical immunoassays use recombinant [[peptide]]s rather than discrete peptide antigens. As the recombinant peptide is many times bigger than the [[epitope]] of interest, a lot of undesired and unwanted peptide sequences are also represented on the microplate. These additional sequences may include unwanted microbial related sequences (as determined by a [[BLAST]] analysis) that can cause issues of low level cross-reactivity. Often the mechanism by which an immunoassay is able to overcome this low level activity is to dilute the serum so that the low level microbial reactive [[antibodies]] are not seen, and only high-level specific antibodies result in an interpretable result. In contrast, FSL Kode constructs usually use specifically selected peptide fragments (up to 40 amino acids),&lt;ref name="Henry2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2012a" /&gt; thereby overcoming cross-reactivity with microbial sequences, and allowing for the use of undiluted [[serum (blood)|serum]] (which increases [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]]).

The F component can be further enhanced by presentation of it in [[multimeric]] formats and with specific spacing. The four types of multimeric format include linear repeating units, linear repeating units with spacing, clusters, and branching ''(Fig. 4)''.

=== Amphiphilic FSL Kode construct ===

The FSL Kode construct by nature of its composition in possessing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]] (or amphipathic). This characteristic determines the way in which the construct will interact with surfaces. When present in a [[solution]] they may form simple [[micelles]] or adopt more complex bilayer structures with two simplistic examples shown in ''Fig. 5a''. More complex structures are expected. The actual nature of FSL micelles has not been determined. However, based on normal structural function of micelles, it is expected that it will be determined in part by the combination of functional group, spacer and lipid together with temperature, [[concentration]], size and [[hydrophobicity|hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity]] for each FSL Kode construct type.

Surface coatings will occur via two theoretical mechanisms, the first being direct hydrophobic interaction of the lipid tail with a hydrophobic surface resulting in a [[monolayer]] of FSL at the surface ''(Fig. 5b)''. Hydrophobic binding of the FSL will be via its hydrophobic lipid tail interacting directly with the hydrophobic ([[lipophilic]]) surface. The second surface coating will be through the formation of bilayers as the lipid tail is unable to react with the hydrophilic surface. In this case the lipids will induce the formation of a bilayer, the surface of which will be hydrophilic. This hydrophilic membrane will then interact directly with the hydrophilic surface and will probably encapsulate [[fibres]]. This hydrophilic bilayer binding is the expected mechanism by which FSLs are able to bind to fibrous membranes such as paper&lt;ref name="Henry2012c"/&gt; and glass fibres ''(Fig. 5c)'' and ''(Fig. 9)''.

}}

After labeling of the surface with the selected F bioactive(s) the constructs will be present and orientated at the membrane surface. It is expected that the FSL will be highly mobile within the membrane and the choice of lipid tail will effect is relative partitioning within the membrane.&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt; The construct unless it has [[Lipid bilayer phase behavior|flip-flop behavior]] is expected to remain surface presented. However, the modification is not permanent in living cells and constructs will be lost (consumed) at a rate proportional to the activity at the membrane and [[Cell division|division rate of the cell]] (with dead cells remaining highly labeled).&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; Additionally, when present ''in vivo'' with serum lipids FSLs will elute from the membrane into the plasma at a rate of about 1% per hour.&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt; In fixed cells or inactive cells (e.g. red cells) stored in serum free media the constructs are retained normally.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;

Liposomes are easy koded by simply adding FSL Kode constructs into the preparation. Contacting koded liposomes with microplates or other surfaces can cause the labeling of the microplate surface.

=== Non-biologic surface interaction ===
Non-biologic surface coatings will occur via two mechanisms, the first being direct hydrophobic interaction of the lipid tail with a hydrophobic surface resulting in a monolayer of FSL at the surface. The second surface coating will be through the formation of bilayers, which probably either encapsulate fibres or being via the hydrophilic F group. This is the expected mechanism by which FSLs bind to fibrous membranes such as paper&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt; and glass fibres. A recent study has found that when FSL Kode constructs are optimised, could in a few seconds glycosylate almost any non-biological surface including metals, glass, plastics, rubbers, and other polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ultra-Fast Glyco-Coating of Non-Biological Surfaces|url = http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/17/1/118|journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences|date = 2016-01-16|pages = 118|volume = 17|issue = 1|doi = 10.3390/ijms17010118|language = en|first = Eleanor|last = Williams|first2 = Katie|last2 = Barr|first3 = Elena|last3 = Korchagina|first4 = Alexander|last4 = Tuzikov|first5 = Stephen|last5 = Henry|first6 = Nicolai|last6 = Bovin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology features ==

The technological features of FSL Kode constructs and the koding process can be summarized as follows:
* '''Rapid and simple''' – simple contact for 10–120 minutes and constructs spontaneously and stably incorporate – no washing required.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;
* '''Replicable''' – same variables (time, temperature, concentration) equals the same result.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frame2007" /&gt;
* '''Toxicity''' – FSL constructs are [[biocompatible]], disperse into biological solutions without [[solvents]], detergents. They label non-covalently and are non-genetic. Normal [[vitality]] and functionality is maintained in modified cells/virions/organisms.&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lan2012" /&gt; Toxicity/vitality experiments in small laboratory animals, [[zebrafish]], [[cell culture]]s, [[spermatozoa]] and [[embryos]] find no [[toxic]] effects within physiological ranges.
* '''Amphiphilic''' – the [[amphiphilic]] nature of the FSL Kode construct makes them water dispersible (clear solution of micelles), yet once interacted with a membrane they insert/coat and become water resistant
* '''Variable design''' – a single F can be presented in more than 100 ways by varying the spacer and lipid.
* '''High biovisibility''' – as the spacer holds the F moiety away for the membrane it is able to achieve increased sensitivity, specificity and reactivity can be optimized by use of multiple and variable biomarker presentations on the same surface.
* '''Additive''' – FSL modification is compatible with other technologies allowing users to add additional features to cells/viruses/organisms/surfaces already modified by more traditional methods. Multiple FSL constructs may be added to a surface simultaneously by simply creating a mix of FSL Kode constructs. Constructs insert into living or fixed cell ([[Glutaraldehyde#Fixative|glutaraldehyde]]) membranes. 
[[File:RFG maleimide construction.svg|thumb|''Fig. 8'' FSLs can be easily created from [[cysteine]]-containing peptides, proteins or any other [[thiol]]s of biological interest. The mixing of a cysteine containing peptide with FSL-RFG(Maleimide), in [[N-Methylmorpholine|4MMF]] buffer, allows the peptide to react with the [[maleimide]] residue of the FSL (through the well-known [[Michael reaction|Michael nucleophilic addition reaction]]). Following overnight incubation then vacuum drying, an FSL peptide is created. No purification is required.|400x400px]]
* '''Simple FSL peptide synthesis''' – there is a reactive-functional-group FSL Kode construct with maleimide as its functional group which can be used for preparation of FSLs from [[cysteine]]-containing peptides, proteins or any other [[thiol]]s of biological interest.&lt;ref name="Henry2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2012a" /&gt; The effective synthetic approach is based on the well-known [[Michael reaction|Michael nucleophilic]] addition to maleimides ''(Fig. 7)''.
* '''Synthetic "Gylcolipids"''' – one family of the FSL constructs are synthetic [[glycolipid]]s with well-defined hydrophobic tails and carbohydrate head groups

=== Koded membranes surfaces and solutions ===
FSL constructs have a wide range of uses and they have been used to modify the following:
* '''Cells''' – [[blood cell]]s,&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frame2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgakopoulos2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hult2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2012b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heathcote2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nadarajan2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chesla2010" /&gt; [[Cell culture|culture lines]],&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; [[embryos]],&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; [[spermatozoa]]&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;
* '''Viruses'''&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt; – influenza,&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; [[measles]], [[varicella]]
* '''Organisms''' – [[parasite]]s, [[microbe]]s, [[zebrafish]]&lt;ref name="Lan2012" /&gt;
* '''Liposomes''' – also micelles, lipid particles&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt;
* '''Surfaces/fibres''' – hydrophobic or hydrophilic membranes/fibres, paper,&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt; [[nitrocellulose]], cotton, silk, glass, [[Teflon]], [[silica]], magnetic beads (microspheres)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rapid biofunctionalization of magnetic beads with function-spacer-lipid constructs|url = http://sepmag.eu/blog/bid/401297/Rapid-biofunctionalization-of-magnetic-beads-with-function-spacer-lipid-constructs|website = sepmag.eu|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.
* '''Solutions''' – saline, plasma/serum, culture media

== Methodology for FSL use (koding) ==
[[File:Preparation of kodecytes and kodevirions.svg|thumb|''Fig. 9'' Preparation of [[kodecytes]]/[[kodevirions]]. Simply mix cells/virions with an FSL solution (containing 1 or more FSLs) and incubate for 10–120 minutes at 37°C (or at temperatures as low as 4°C). The constructs will spontaneously incorporate into the membrane and no further steps are required.|400x400px]]
FSL constructs, when in solution ([[Saline (medicine)|saline]]) and in contact, will spontaneously incorporate into cell and virus membranes.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; The methodology involves simply preparing a solution of FSL construct(s) in the range of 1–1000 [[µg]]/[[millilitre|mL]]. The actual concentration will depend on the construct and the quantity of construct required in the membrane. One part of FSL solution is added to one part of cells (up to 100% [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]) and they are incubated at a set temperature within the range of 4–37&amp;nbsp;°C (39–99&amp;nbsp;°F) depending on temperature compatibility of the cells being modified. The higher the temperature, the faster the rate of FSL insertion into the membrane. For red blood cells, at 37&amp;nbsp;°C incubation for 2 hours achieves &gt;95% insertion with at least 50% insertion being achieved within 20 minutes. In general, FSL insertion time of 4 hours at room temperature or 20 hours at 4&amp;nbsp;°C gives results similar to 1 hour at 37&amp;nbsp;°C for carbohydrate based FSLs inserting into red blood cells.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; The resultant kodecytes or kodevirions do not required to be washed, however this option should be considered if an excess of FSL construct is used in the koding process.

== Applications ==
FSL Kode constructs have been used for research and development, [[diagnostic]] products, and are currently being investigated as potential [[therapeutic]] agents.

=== Kodecytes ===
{{main article|Kodecyte#Applications}}

FSL have been used to create human red cell kodecytes that have been used to detect and identify blood group allo-antibodies&lt;ref name="Heathcote2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nadarajan2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2011" /&gt; as [[ABO blood group system|ABO]] sub-group mimics,&lt;ref name="Hult2012" /&gt; ABO quality control systems,&lt;ref name="Henry2009" /&gt; [[serologic]] teaching kits&lt;ref name="Henry2012b" /&gt; and a [[syphilis]] diagnostic.&lt;ref name="Chesla2010" /&gt; Kodecytes have also demonstrated that FSL-FLRO4 is a suitable reagent for labelling [[packed red blood cells]] (PRBC) at any point during routine storage and look to facilitate the development of immunoassays and transfusion models focused on addressing the mechanisms involved in [[Transfusion-related immunomodulation|tansfusion-related immunomodulation]] (TRIM).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Murine kodecytes have been experimentally used to determine ''in vivo'' cell survival,&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt; and create model [[Transfusion reaction#Complications of transfusions|transfusion reactions]].&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt; Zebrafish kodecytes have been used to determine real time ''in vivo'' cell migration.&lt;ref name="Lan2012" /&gt; Kodecytes have been used to create influenza diagnostics.&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; Kodecytes which have been modified with FSL-GB3 were unable to be infected with the [[HIV virus]].&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Branch2008" /&gt;

=== Kodevirions ===
{{main article|Kodevirions#Applications}}

Kodevirions are FSL modified viruses. Several FSL Kode constructs have been used to label viruses to assist in their [[Flow cytometry|flow-cytometric visualisation]]&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt; and to track them real time distribution in animal models.&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt; They have also been used to modify the surface of viruses with the intention of targeting them to be used to attach [[tumor]]s ([[oncolytic]]).&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt;

=== Kodesomes ===
Kodesomes are liposomes that have been decorated with FSL Kode constructs. These have been used to deposit FSL constructs onto microplates to create diagnostic [[assay]]s. They also have the potential for therapeutic use.&lt;ref name="Harrison2011" /&gt;

=== Koded solutions ===
These are solutions containing FSL Kode constructs where the construct will exist as a clear micellular dispersion. FSL-GB3 as a solution/gel has been used to inhibit HIV infection&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt; and to neutralise [[Shiga toxin]].&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt; FSL blood group A as a solution has been used to neutralise circulating antibodies in a [[mouse]] model and allow incompatible blood group A ([[murine]] kodecytes) transfusion.&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt; This model experiment was used to demonstrate the potential of FSLs to neutralise circulating antibody and allow for incompatible blood transfusion or [[organ transplantation]].&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt;

=== Koded surfaces ===
[[File:Inkjet Printed FSLs.jpg|thumb|''Fig. 10'' FSL constructs can be printed with a [[Inkjet printer|standard desktop inkjet printer]] directly onto paper to create [[immunoassay]]s. Image is a typical example of an inkjet printed enzyme immunoassay (EIA) where 12 different FSL constructs were printed as identifying codes on paper and then reacted against different samples. The antibody activity in the samples can be identified by appearance of words identifying the target antigen. An empty inkjet cartridge is filled with an FSL construct and words, barcodes, or graphics are printed. A [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Perspex]] template is adhered to the surface to create [[Microtiter plate|reaction wells]]. The method is then a standard [[immunoassay|EIA]] procedure, but blocking of serum is not required and undiluted serum can be used. A typical EIA procedure is as follows: add serum, incubate, wash by immersion, add secondary EIA [[Immunoassay#Detection Antibody|detection antibody]], incubate, wash, add [[Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride|NBT]]/BCIP precipitating substrate and stop the reaction when developed by washing. The end result is stable for years.|541x541px]]

All FSL Kode constructs disperse in water and are therefore compatible with [[inkjet printer]]s. FSL constructs can be printed with a standard desktop inkjet printer directly onto paper to create immunoassays.&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt; An empty ink cartridge is filled with an FSL construct and words, [[barcode]]s, or graphics are printed.

A typical procedure is as follows: add serum, incubate, wash by immersion, add secondary EIA conjugate, incubate, wash, add [[Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride|NBT]]/[[BCIP]] precipitating substrate and stop the reaction when developed by washing ''(Fig. 9)''. The end result is stable for years.

'''George Edward Lynch Cotton''' or '''Bishop Cotton''' (29 October 1813 – 6 October 1866) was an English educator and clergyman, known for his connections with [[British India]] and the [[Public school (UK)|public school]] system.

==Life in England==
[[File:Bishop_Cotton_NPG.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait c. 1854 ([[National Portrait Gallery, London|NPG]]]]
He was born at [[Chester, England|Chester]], a grandson of the late [[George Cotton (priest)|George Cotton]], [[Dean of Chester]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p24689.htm#i246890 The Peerage – Thomas Davenant Cotton]&lt;/ref&gt; He received his education at [[The King's School, Chester]],&lt;ref name="InspirationalAlumni"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inspirational Alumni Members |url=http://www.kingschester.co.uk/extras/KingsAlumni/inspirationalAlumni.html |publisher=The King's School Chester |accessdate=2 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215071558/http://www.kingschester.co.uk/extras/KingsAlumni/inspirationalAlumni.html |archivedate=December 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Westminster School]], and at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CTN832GE|name=Cotton, George}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he joined the [[Low Church]] party, and was a close friend of several disciples of [[Thomas Arnold]], including [[Charles John Vaughan|CJ Vaughan]] and [[William John Conybeare|WJ Conybeare]]. Arnold's influence determined the character and course of Cotton's life.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He graduated BA in 1836, and became an assistant master at [[Rugby School]]. He became master of the fifth form in about 1840.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In 1852 he accepted the appointment of headmaster at [[Marlborough College]]. Both Rugby School and Marlborough College [[House system|boarding houses]] were subsequently named after him.

==India==
In 1858 Cotton was offered the office of the [[Anglican Diocese of Calcutta|Bishop of Calcutta]], which, after much hesitation, he accepted. The government of [[India]] had just been transferred from the [[British East India Company]] to the crown, and questions of education were eagerly discussed, following [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]]'s famous ''Minute on Indian Education''.

Cotton established schools for British and Eurasian children - the [[Bishop Cotton School (Shimla)|Bishop Cotton School Shimla]], the [[Bishop Cotton Boys' School]] and [[Bishop Cotton Girls High School|Bishop Cotton Girls' School]] in Bangalore and the [[Bishop Cotton High School]] in Nagpur which bear his name. He founded many other schools in India, including [[St. James' School (India)|St. James' School]] in Calcutta and [[Cathedral and John Connon]] in [[Bombay]].
 
As the senior Anglican prelate in India, he also consecrated a number of new churches throughout the subcontinent, including [[St. Luke's Church, Abbottabad]], and others on what then used to be the '[[Punjab Frontier]]' and later became the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North West Frontier Province]].

Cotton married Sophia Ann Tomkinson, daughter of Reverend Henry Tomkinson, on 26 June 1845. Their son [[Edward Cotton-Jodrell]] was later MP for Wirral.

A memoir of his life with selections from his journals and correspondence, edited by his widow, was published in 1871.

==Death==
On 6 October 1866, he had consecrated a cemetery at Kushtia on the [[Ganges]], and was crossing a plank leading from the bank to the steamer when he slipped and fell into the river. He was carried away by the current and never seen again.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The phrase "to bless one's cotton socks" is traceable to Cotton's death. While Bishop of Calcutta, Cotton ensured that children in his schools had socks to wear, and he blessed the socks upon their arrival, as he did other goods. Over time, "Cotton's socks" became "Cotton socks". Upon his sudden death, the Archbishop was asked, "Who will bless his cotton socks". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-1344,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George II''' (George Augustus; {{lang-de|link=no|Georg II. August}}; 30 October / 9 November 1683{{ref|dates|O.S./N.S.}}&amp;nbsp;– 25 October 1760) was [[King of Great Britain]] and [[King of Ireland|Ireland]], Duke of [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick-Lüneburg]] ([[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]]) and a [[prince-elector]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 11 June 1727 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]) until his death in 1760.

George was the last [[List of British monarchs|British monarch]] born outside Great Britain: he was born and brought up in [[northern Germany]]. His grandmother, [[Sophia of Hanover]], became second in line to the British throne after about 50 Catholics higher in line were excluded by the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the [[Acts of Union 1707]], which restricted the succession to Protestants. After the deaths of Sophia and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], in 1714, his father [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], Elector of Hanover, inherited the British throne. In the first years of his father's reign as king, George was associated with opposition politicians, until they rejoined the governing party in 1720.

As king from 1727, George exercised little control over British domestic policy, which was largely controlled by the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. As elector, he spent twelve summers in Hanover, where he had more direct control over government policy. He had a difficult relationship with his eldest son, [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Frederick]], who supported the parliamentary opposition. During the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], George participated at the [[Battle of Dettingen]] in 1743, and thus became the last British monarch to lead an army in battle. In 1745, supporters of the Catholic claimant to the British throne, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] ("The Old Pretender"), led by James's son [[Charles Edward Stuart]] ("The Young Pretender" or "Bonnie Prince Charlie"), attempted and failed to depose George in the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|last of the Jacobite rebellions]]. Frederick died unexpectedly in 1751, nine years before his father, so George II was ultimately succeeded by his grandson, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].

For two centuries after George II's death, history tended to view him with disdain, concentrating on his mistresses, short temper, and boorishness. Since then, most scholars have reassessed his legacy and conclude that he held and exercised influence in foreign policy and military appointments.

==Early life==
[[File:Sophie Dorothea Prinzessin von Ahlden.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Sophia Dorothea and her two children|George as a young boy with his mother, [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle]], and his sister, [[Sophia Dorothea of Hanover]]]]
George was born in the city of [[Hanover]] in Germany, and was the son of George Louis, Hereditary Prince of [[Electorate of Hanover|Brunswick-Lüneburg]] (later King [[George I of Great Britain]]), and his wife, [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle]]. His sister, [[Sophia Dorothea of Hanover|Sophia Dorothea]], was born when he was three years old. Both of George's parents committed adultery, and in 1694&lt;!--28 December 1694 O.S.--&gt; their marriage was dissolved on the pretext that Sophia had abandoned her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; She was confined to [[Ahlden House]] and denied access to her two children, who probably never saw their mother again.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 35–36; Thompson, p. 19; Van der Kiste, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

George spoke only French, the language of diplomacy and the court, until the age of four, after which he was taught German by one of his tutors, Johann Hilmar Holstein.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to French and German, he was also schooled in English and Italian, and studied genealogy, military history, and battle tactics with particular diligence.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 7; Van der Kiste, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

George's [[Cousin#Cousin chart|second cousin once removed]], [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], ascended the thrones of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1702. She had no surviving children, and by the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] designated Anne's closest Protestant [[Consanguinity|blood relations]], George's grandmother [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia]] and her descendants, as Anne's heirs in England and Ireland. Consequently, after his grandmother and father, George was third in line to succeed Anne in two of her three realms. He was naturalized as an English subject in 1705 by the [[Sophia Naturalization Act 1705|Sophia Naturalization Act]], and in 1706, he was made a [[Knight of the Garter]] and created [[Duke of Cambridge|Duke and Marquess of Cambridge]], Earl of Milford Haven, Viscount Northallerton, and Baron Tewkesbury in the [[Peerage of England]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; England and Scotland [[Acts of Union 1707|united in 1707]] to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and jointly accepted the succession as laid down by the English Act of Settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Ann/6/11/contents Union with Scotland Act 1706] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aosp/1707/7/contents Union with England Act 1707], The National Archives, retrieved 20 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==

[[File:Caroline Wilhelmina of Brandenburg-Ansbach by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|[[Caroline of Ansbach]] by [[Godfrey Kneller]], 1716]]

George's father did not want his son to enter into a loveless arranged marriage as he had, and wanted him to have the opportunity of meeting his bride before any formal arrangements were made.&lt;ref name=vdk17/&gt; Negotiations from 1702 for the hand of Princess [[Hedvig Sophia of Sweden]], Dowager Duchess and regent of [[Holstein-Gottorp]], came to nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1705, under the false name of "Monsieur de Busch", George visited the [[Principality of Ansbach|Ansbach]] court at their summer residence in Triesdorf to investigate ''incognito'' a marriage prospect: [[Caroline of Ansbach]], the former ward of his aunt [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover|Queen Sophia Charlotte of Prussia]]. The English envoy to Hanover, [[Edmund Poley]], reported that George was so taken by "the good character he had of her that he would not think of anybody else".&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; A marriage contract was concluded by the end of July.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 30; Van der Kiste, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August / 2 September 1705{{ref|dates|O.S./N.S.}} Caroline arrived in Hanover for her wedding, which was held the same evening in the chapel at [[Herrenhausen Gardens|Herrenhausen]].&lt;ref name=vdk17&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

George was keen to participate in the [[War of the Spanish Succession|war against France]] in [[Flanders]], but his father refused permission for him to join the army in an active role until he had a son and heir.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 31; Van der Kiste, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1707, George's hopes were fulfilled when Caroline gave birth to a son, [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Frederick]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In July, Caroline fell seriously ill with [[smallpox]], and George caught the infection after staying by her side devotedly during her illness.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; They both recovered. In 1708, George participated in the [[Battle of Oudenarde]] in the vanguard of the Hanoverian cavalry; his horse and a colonel&lt;!--Colonel Johann Albrecht von Lösecke--&gt; immediately beside him were killed, but George survived unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 32; Trench, p. 18; Van der Kiste, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The British commander, [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough]], wrote that George "distinguished himself extremely, charging at the head of and animating by his example [the Hanoverian] troops, who played a good part in this happy victory".&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1709 and 1713, George and Caroline had three more children, all girls: [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Anne]], [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Amelia]], and [[Princess Caroline of Great Britain|Caroline]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1714, Queen Anne's health had declined, and [[British Whig Party|British Whigs]], politicians who supported the Hanoverian succession, thought it prudent for one of the Hanoverians to live in England, to safeguard the Protestant succession on Anne's death. As George was a [[peer of the realm]] (as Duke of Cambridge), it was suggested that he be summoned to Parliament to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. Both Anne and George's father refused to support the plan, although George, Caroline, and Sophia were all in favour.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; George did not go. Within the year, both Sophia and Anne were dead, and George's father was king.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prince of Wales==

===Quarrel with the king===
[[File:The Thames at Horseferry1710.jpg|thumb|right|London, ''circa'' 1710]]
[[File:Kneller - George II when Prince of Wales.png|thumb|Portrait by Kneller, 1716]]
George and his father sailed for England from [[The Hague]] on 16/27 September 1714 and arrived at [[Greenwich]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, they formally entered London in a ceremonial procession.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 38; Van der Kiste, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; George was given the title of [[Prince of Wales]]. Caroline followed her husband to Britain in October with their daughters, while Frederick remained in Hanover to be brought up by private tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 39–40; Trench, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; London was like nothing George had seen before; it was 50 times larger than Hanover,{{ref|Hanover|A}} and the crowd was estimated at up to one and a half million spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; George courted popularity with voluble expressions of praise for the English, and claimed that he had no drop of blood that was not English.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 55; Van der Kiste, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1716, the king returned to Hanover for six months, and George was given limited powers, as "Guardian and Lieutenant of the Realm", to govern in his father's absence.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 63–65; Van der Kiste, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; He made a [[royal progress]] through [[Chichester]], [[Havant]], [[Portsmouth]], and [[Guildford]] in southern England.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Spectators were allowed to see him dine in public at [[Hampton Court Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 45; Thompson, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt on his life at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]], in which one person was shot dead before the assailant&lt;!--Mr Freeman--&gt; was brought under control, boosted his high public profile.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

His father distrusted or was jealous of George's popularity, which contributed to the development of a poor relationship between them.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 75; Van der Kiste, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The birth in 1717 of George's second son, [[Prince George William of Great Britain|Prince George William]], proved to be a catalyst for a family quarrel; the king, supposedly following custom, appointed the [[Lord Chamberlain]], the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]], as one of the [[baptism]]al sponsors of the child. The king was angered when George, who disliked Newcastle, verbally insulted the duke at the christening, which the duke misunderstood as a challenge to a duel.{{ref|duel|B}} George and Caroline were temporarily confined to their apartments on the order of the king, who subsequently banished his son from [[St James's Palace]], the king's residence.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince and Princess of Wales left court, but their children remained in the care of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 46; Thompson, p. 53; Trench, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

George and Caroline missed their children, and were desperate to see them. On one occasion, they secretly visited the palace without the approval of the king; Caroline fainted and George "cried like a child".&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The king partially relented and permitted them to visit once a week, though he later allowed Caroline unconditional access.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; The following February, George William died, with his father by his side.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political opposition===
Banned from the palace and shunned by his own father, the Prince of Wales was identified for the next several years with opposition to [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]'s policies,&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 67, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; which included measures designed to increase religious freedom in Great Britain and expand Hanover's German territories at the expense of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 48–50, 55.&lt;/ref&gt; His new London residence, [[Leicester Square|Leicester House]], became a frequent meeting place for his father's political opponents, including [[Sir Robert Walpole]] and [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Viscount Townshend]], who had left the government in 1717.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 79, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The king visited Hanover again from May to November 1719. Instead of appointing George to the guardianship, he established a regency council.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1720, Walpole encouraged the king and his son to reconcile, for the sake of public unity, which they did half-heartedly.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 57; Trench, pp. 88–90; Van der Kiste, pp. 72–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Walpole and Townshend returned to political office, and rejoined the ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 52; Thompson, p. 58; Trench, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; George was soon disillusioned with the terms of the reconciliation; his three daughters who were in the care of the king were not returned and he was still barred from becoming regent during the king's absences.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; He came to believe that Walpole had tricked him into the rapprochement as part of a scheme to regain power. Over the next few years, Caroline and he lived quietly, avoiding overt political activity. They had three more children: [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|William]], [[Princess Mary of Great Britain|Mary]], and [[Louise of Great Britain|Louisa]], who were brought up at Leicester House and [[Richmond, London|Richmond Lodge]], George's summer residence.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 54; Thompson, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1721, the economic disaster of the [[South Sea Bubble]] allowed Walpole to rise to the pinnacle of government.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Walpole and his [[British Whig Party|Whig]] Party were dominant in politics, as the king feared that the [[Tory|Tories]] would not support the succession laid down in the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]].&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; The power of the Whigs was so great that the Tories would not come to hold power for another half-century.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 45; Trench, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reign==
[[File:King George II by Charles Jervas.jpg|thumb|left|alt=George holding a sceptre|Portrait by [[Charles Jervas]], c.&amp;nbsp;1727]]
George I died on 11/22 June 1727 during one of his visits to Hanover, and George II succeeded him as king and elector at the age of 43. The new king decided not to travel to Germany for his father's funeral, which far from bringing criticism led to praise from the English who considered it proof of his fondness for England.&lt;ref name=vdk97&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; He suppressed his father's will because it attempted to split the Hanoverian succession between George II's future grandsons rather than vest all the domains (both in Britain and Hanover) in a single person. Both British and Hanoverian ministers considered the will unlawful, as George I did not have the legal power to determine the succession personally.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics supposed that George II hid the will to avoid paying out his father's legacies.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 88; Cannon; Trench, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

George II was crowned at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 11/22 October 1727.&lt;ref name=vdk97/&gt; The composer [[George Frideric Handel]] was commissioned to write four new anthems for the coronation, including ''[[Zadok the Priest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was widely believed that George would dismiss Walpole, who had distressed him by joining his father's government, and replace him with [[Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington|Sir Spencer Compton]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 80; Trench, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; George asked Compton, rather than Walpole, to write his first speech as king for him, but Compton asked Walpole to draft it. Caroline advised George to retain Walpole, who continued to gain royal favour by securing a generous [[civil list]] (a fixed annual amount set by Parliament for the king's official expenditure) of £800,000.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George had little choice but to retain him or risk ministerial instability.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 81–84; Black, ''Walpole in Power'', pp. 29–31, 53, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Compton was ennobled as Lord Wilmington the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:George II.jpg|thumb|right|alt=George with his hand on an orb|Portrait by [[Enoch Seeman]], c.&amp;nbsp;1730]]
Walpole directed domestic policy, and after the resignation of his brother-in-law Townshend in 1730 also controlled George's foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians generally believe that George played an honorific role in Britain, and closely followed the advice of Walpole and senior ministers who made the major decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the king was eager for war in Europe, his ministers were more cautious.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anglo-Spanish War (1727–1729)|Anglo-Spanish War]] was brought to an end, and George unsuccessfully pressed Walpole to join the [[War of the Polish Succession]] on the side of the German states.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 173–174; Van der Kiste, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1733, Walpole withdrew an unpopular [[excise]] bill that had gathered strong opposition, including from within his own party. George lent support to Walpole by dismissing the bill's opponents from their [[Court (royal)#Court officials|court offices]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 141–143; Thompson, pp. 102–103; Trench, pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family problems==
George II's relationship with his son and heir apparent, [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], worsened during the 1730s. Frederick had been left behind in Germany when his parents came to England, and they had not met for 14 years. In 1728, he was brought to England, and swiftly became a figurehead of the political opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 141–142; Van der Kiste, pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; When George visited Hanover in the summers of 1729, 1732 and 1735, he left his wife to chair the regency council in Britain rather than his son.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 85–86; Van der Kiste, pp. 118, 126, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, rivalry between George II and his brother-in-law and first cousin [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] led to tension along the Prussian–Hanoverian border, which eventually culminated in the mobilization of troops in the border zone and suggestions of a duel between the two kings. Negotiations for a marriage between the Prince of Wales and Frederick William's daughter [[Wilhelmine of Prussia, Margravine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Wilhelmine]] dragged on for years but neither side would make the concessions demanded by the other, and the idea was shelved.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the prince married [[Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]] in April 1736.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1736, George returned to Hanover, which resulted in unpopularity in England; a satirical notice was even pinned to the gates of St James's Palace decrying his absence. "Lost or strayed out of this house", it read, "a man who has left a wife and six children [[Poor rate|on the parish]]."&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 182–184; Van der Kiste, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt; The king made plans to return in the face of inclement December weather; when his ship was caught in a storm, gossip swept London that he had drowned. Eventually, in January 1737, he arrived back in England.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 185–187; Van der Kiste, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately he fell ill, with [[haemorrhoids|piles]] and a fever, and withdrew to his bed. The Prince of Wales put it about that the king was dying, with the result that George insisted on getting up and attending a social event to disprove the gossip-mongers.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Prince of Wales applied to Parliament for an increase in his allowance, an open quarrel broke out. The king, who had a reputation for meanness,&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 136; Thompson, pp. 7, 64; Trench, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; offered a private settlement, which Frederick rejected. Parliament voted against the measure, but George reluctantly increased his son's allowance on the advice of Walpole.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 189–190; Van der Kiste, pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Further friction between them followed when Frederick excluded the king and queen from the birth of his daughter in July 1737 by bundling his wife, who was in labour, into a coach and driving off in the middle of the night.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 120; Trench, p. 192; Van der Kiste, pp. 155–157.&lt;/ref&gt; George banished him and his family from the royal court, much like the punishment his own father had brought upon him with the exception that he allowed Frederick to retain custody of his children.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 196; Van der Kiste, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards, George's wife Caroline died on 20 November 1737 (O.S.). He was deeply affected by her death, and to the surprise of many displayed "a tenderness of which the world thought him before utterly incapable".&lt;ref&gt;Hervey's Memoirs, vol. III, p. 916, quoted in Thompson, p. 124, and Van der Kiste, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; On her deathbed she told her sobbing husband to remarry, to which he replied, "Non, j'aurai des maîtresses!" (French for "No, I shall have mistresses!").&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 124; Trench, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; It was common knowledge that George had already had mistresses during his marriage, and he had kept Caroline informed about them.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 92; Trench, pp. 175, 181.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk|Henrietta Howard]], later Countess of Suffolk, had moved to Hanover with her husband during the reign of Queen Anne,&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 25, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; and she had been one of Caroline's [[Woman of the Bedchamber|women of the bedchamber]]. She was his mistress from before the accession of George I until November 1734. She was followed by [[Amalie von Wallmoden, Countess of Yarmouth|Amalie von Wallmoden]], later Countess of Yarmouth, whose son, [[Johann Ludwig von Wallmoden]], may have been fathered by George. Johann Ludwig was born while Amalie was still married to her husband, and George did not acknowledge him publicly as his own son.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 157; Kilburn; Weir, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War and rebellion==
Against Walpole's wishes, but to George's delight, Britain reopened hostilities with Spain in 1739.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's conflict with Spain, the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]], became part of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] when a major European dispute broke out upon the death of [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]] in 1740. At issue was the right of Charles's daughter, [[Maria Theresa]], to succeed to his Austrian dominions.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; George spent the summers of 1740 and 1741 in Hanover, where he was more able to intervene directly in European diplomatic affairs in his capacity as elector.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 133, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Frederick campaigned actively for the opposition in the [[British general election, 1741|British general election of 1741]], and Walpole was unable to secure a stable majority. Walpole attempted to buy off the prince with the promise of an increased allowance and offered to pay off his debts, but Frederick refused.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 174; Trench, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; With his support eroded, Walpole retired in 1742 after over 20 years in office. He was replaced by [[Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington|Spencer Compton, Lord Wilmington]], whom George had originally considered for the premiership in 1727. Lord Wilmington, however, was a figurehead;&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; actual power was held by others, such as [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Carteret]], George's favourite minister after Walpole.&lt;ref name=cannon/&gt; When Wilmington died in 1743, [[Henry Pelham]] took his place at the head of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GeorgeIIWootton1743.jpg|thumb|right|alt=George on a white horse|George II envisioned at the [[Battle of Dettingen]] in 1743 by [[John Wootton]]]]
[[File:george2coin.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Coin shown heads up|[[Half crown (British coin)|Half-Crown]] of George II, 1746. The inscription reads GEORGIUS II DEI GRATIA (George II by the Grace of God). The word LIMA under the king's head signifies that the coin was struck from silver seized from the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] off [[Lima]], Peru, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/s/silver_lima_crown_5_shillings.aspx "Silver 'Lima' crown (5 shillings) of George II"], [[British Museum]], retrieved 26 August 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429230829/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/s/silver_lima_crown_5_shillings.aspx |date=29 April 2011 |title=Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The pro-war faction was led by Carteret, who claimed that French power would increase if Maria Theresa failed to succeed to the Austrian throne. George agreed to send 12,000 hired Hessian and Danish mercenaries to Europe, ostensibly to support Maria Theresa. Without conferring with his British ministers, George stationed them in Hanover to prevent enemy French troops from marching into the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 211–212.&lt;/ref&gt; The British army had not fought in a major European war in over 20 years, and the government had badly neglected its upkeep.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 206–209.&lt;/ref&gt; George had pushed for greater professionalism in the ranks, and promotion by merit rather than by [[sale of commissions]], but without much success.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 111; Trench, pp. 136, 208; Van der Kiste, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; An allied force of Austrian, British, Dutch, Hanoverian and Hessian troops engaged the French at the [[Battle of Dettingen]] on 16/27 June 1743. George personally accompanied them, leading them to victory, thus becoming the last British monarch to lead troops into battle.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 148; Trench, pp. 217–223.&lt;/ref&gt; Though his actions in the battle were admired, the war became unpopular with the British public, who felt that the king and Carteret were subordinating British interests to Hanoverian ones.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 181–184; Van der Kiste, pp. 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt; Carteret lost support, and to George's dismay resigned in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 185–186; Thompson, p. 160; Van der Kiste, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tension grew between the Pelham ministry and George, as he continued to take advice from Carteret and rejected pressure from his other ministers to include [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] in the Cabinet, which would have broadened the government's support base.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 190–193; Thompson, pp. 162, 169; Trench, pp. 234–235.&lt;/ref&gt; The king disliked Pitt because he had previously opposed government policy and attacked measures seen as pro-Hanoverian.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 164, 184, 195.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1746, Pelham and his followers resigned. George asked [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Lord Bath]] and Carteret to [[Short-lived ministry|form an administration]], but after less than 48 hours they returned the seals of office, unable to secure sufficient parliamentary support. Pelham returned to office triumphant, and George was forced to appoint Pitt to the ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 190–193; Cannon; Trench, pp. 234–235.&lt;/ref&gt;

George's French opponents encouraged [[Jacobite risings|rebellion by the Jacobites]], the supporters of the Roman Catholic claimant to the British throne, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], often known as the Old Pretender. Stuart was the son of [[James II of England|James II]], who had been deposed in 1688 and replaced by his Protestant relations. Two prior rebellions in [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1719|1719]] had failed. In July 1745, the Old Pretender's son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]], popularly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie or the Young Pretender, landed in Scotland, where support for his cause was highest. George, who was summering in Hanover, returned to London at the end of August.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jacobites defeated British forces in September at the [[Battle of Prestonpans]], and then moved south into England. The Jacobites failed to gain further support, and the French reneged on a promise of help. Losing morale, the Jacobites retreated back into Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16/27 April 1746, Charles faced George's military-minded son [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]], in the [[Battle of Culloden]], the last pitched battle fought on British soil. The ravaged Jacobite troops were routed by the government army. Charles escaped to France, but many of his supporters were caught and executed. Jacobitism was all but crushed; no further serious attempt was made at restoring the [[House of Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; The War of the Austrian Succession continued until 1748, when Maria Theresa was recognized as Archduchess of Austria. The peace was celebrated by a fête in [[Green Park, London]], for which Handel composed ''[[Music for the Royal Fireworks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 187–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:George II 1755-1767.jpg|thumb|left|alt=George in his seventies|Portrait by [[John Shackleton]], in or after 1755]]
In the [[British general election, 1747|general election of 1747]], the Prince of Wales again campaigned actively for the opposition but Pelham's party won easily.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 199; Trench, p. 243; Van der Kiste, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father before him, the Prince entertained opposition figures at his house in [[Leicester Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Prince of Wales died suddenly in 1751, his eldest son, [[George III of the United Kingdom|Prince George]], became heir apparent. The king commiserated with the [[Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha|Dowager Princess of Wales]] and wept with her.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 208; Trench, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; As her son would not reach the age of majority until 1756, a new British Regency Act was passed to make her regent, assisted by a council led by the Duke of Cumberland, in case of George II's death.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 207–211; Thompson, p. 209; Trench, p. 249; Van der Kiste, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The king also made a new will, which provided for Cumberland to be sole regent in Hanover.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his daughter Louisa at the end of the year, George lamented, "This has been a fatal year for my family. I lost my eldest son&amp;nbsp;– but I am glad of it&amp;nbsp;... Now [Louisa] is gone. I know I did not love my children when they were young: I hated to have them running into my room; but now I love them as well as most fathers."&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace Walpole]]'s memoirs, vol. I, p. 152, quoted in Thompson, p. 213 and Trench, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seven Years' War===
In 1754, Pelham died, to be succeeded by his elder brother, the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]]. Hostility between France and Britain, particularly over the [[colonization of North America]], continued.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 233–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing a French invasion of Hanover, George aligned himself with Prussia (ruled by his nephew, [[Frederick the Great]]), the enemy of Austria. Russia and France allied with their former enemy Austria. A French [[Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)|invasion of the British-held island of Minorca]] led to the outbreak of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1756. Public disquiet over British failures at the start of the conflict led to the resignation of Newcastle and the appointment of the [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]] as prime minister and [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] as [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 231–232; Thompson, p. 252; Trench, pp. 271–274.&lt;/ref&gt; In April the following year, George dismissed Pitt, in an attempt to construct an administration more to his liking. Over the succeeding three months attempts to form another stable ministerial combination failed. In June, [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave]], held the seals of office for only four days. By the start of July, Pitt was recalled, and the Duke of Newcastle returned as prime minister. As Secretary of State, Pitt guided policy relating to the war. Great Britain, Hanover and Prussia and their allies [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] and [[Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] were pitted against other European powers, including France, Austria, Russia, Sweden and [[Saxony]]. The war involved multiple theatres from Europe to North America and India, where British dominance increased with the victories of [[Robert Clive]] over French forces and their allies at the [[Battle of Arcot]] and the [[Battle of Plassey]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, p. 677.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland by Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|George said his son [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]] (pictured), had "ruined me and disgraced himself" at the [[Convention of Klosterzeven]], 1757.]]

George's son, the Duke of Cumberland, commanded the king's troops in northern Germany. In 1757, [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|Hanover was invaded]] and George gave Cumberland full powers to conclude a separate peace.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 265–266; Trench, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; By September, however, he was furious at [[Convention of Klosterzeven|Cumberland's negotiated settlement]], which he felt greatly favoured the French.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 268; Trench, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; George said his son had "ruined me and disgraced himself".&lt;ref&gt;Horace Walpole's memoirs, vol. III, p. 61, quoted in Trench, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland, by his own choice, resigned his military offices,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 276; Trench, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; and George revoked the peace deal on the grounds that the French had infringed it by disarming Hessian troops after the ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 270; Trench, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Annus Mirabilis of 1759|annus mirabilis]]'' of 1759 British forces [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|captured Quebec]] and [[Invasion of Guadeloupe (1759)|Guadeloupe]]. A French [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|plan to invade Britain]] was defeated following naval battles at [[Battle of Lagos|Lagos]] and [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay]],&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 293–296.&lt;/ref&gt; and a resumed French advance on Hanover was halted by a joint British–Hanoverian force at the [[Battle of Minden]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 282–283.&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 1760, George II was blind in one eye and [[hard of hearing]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 275; Trench, p. 292; Van der Kiste, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00&amp;nbsp;am, drank a cup of hot chocolate, and went to his [[close stool]], alone. After a few minutes, his valet&lt;!--Schröder--&gt; heard a loud crash and entered the room to find the king on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 289–290; Van der Kiste, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; The king was lifted into his bed, and [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Princess Amelia]] was sent for; before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer than any of his English or British predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[post-mortem]] revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient [[aortic aneurysm]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Nicholls|Nicholls, Frank]] (1761) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bYWNFD7xRXkC&amp;pg=PA265 "Observations concerning the body of His Late Majesty"], ''Philos Trans Lond'' '''52''': 265–274.&lt;/ref&gt;

George II was succeeded by his grandson [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and was buried on 11 November in [[Westminster Abbey]]. He left instructions for the sides of his and his wife's coffins to be removed so that their remains could mingle.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 253; Thompson, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the most recent monarch to be buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].

==Legacy==
[[File:George II statue 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Weathered statue in Roman garb|Statue by [[John Van Nost]] erected in 1753 in [[Golden Square]], London&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, between pp. 150 and 151.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
George donated the royal library to the [[British Museum]] in 1757, four years after the museum's foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 68, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; He had no interest in reading,&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 127; Thompson, pp. 97–98; Trench, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the arts and sciences, and preferred to spend his leisure hours stag-hunting on horseback or playing cards.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 128; Trench, pp. 140, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1737, he founded the [[Georg August University of Göttingen]], the first university in the [[Electorate of Hanover]], and visited it in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[asteroid]] [[359 Georgia]] was named in his honour at the University in 1902. He served as the Chancellor of [[University of Dublin|Trinity College, Dublin]], between 1716 and 1727, and in 1754 issued the charter for King's College in New York City, which later became [[Columbia University]]. The [[province of Georgia]], founded by royal charter in 1732, was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

During George II's reign British interests expanded throughout the world, the Jacobite challenge to the Hanoverian dynasty was extinguished, and the power of ministers and Parliament in Britain became well-established. Nevertheless, in the memoirs of contemporaries such as [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|Lord Hervey]] and [[Horace Walpole]], George is depicted as a weak buffoon, governed by his wife and ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 255–257.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographies of George written during the nineteenth and first part of the twentieth century relied on these biased accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 257–258.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the last quarter of the twentieth century, scholarly analysis of surviving correspondence has indicated that George was not as ineffective as previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 258–259.&lt;/ref&gt; Letters from ministers are annotated by George with pertinent remarks and demonstrate that he had a grasp of and interest in foreign policy in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 144–146; Cannon; Trench, pp. 135–136.&lt;/ref&gt; He was often able to prevent the appointment of ministers or commanders he disliked, or sideline them into lesser offices.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; This academic reassessment of George II, however, has not totally eliminated the popular perception of him as a "faintly ludicrous king".&lt;ref&gt;Best, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; His parsimony, for example, may have opened him to ridicule, but his biographers observe that parsimony is preferable to extravagance.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 82; Trench, p. 300; ''Lord Waldegrave's Memoirs'' quoted in Trench, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont|Lord Charlemont]] excused George's short temper by explaining that sincerity of feeling is better than deception, "His temper was warm and impetuous, but he was good-natured and sincere. Unskilled in the royal talent of dissimulation, he always was what he appeared to be. He might offend, but he never deceived."&lt;ref&gt;Charlemont quoted in Cannon and Trench, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|Lord Waldegrave]] wrote, "I am thoroughly convinced that hereafter, when time shall have wore away those specks and blemishes which sully the brightest characters, and from which no man is totally exempt, he will be numbered amongst those patriot kings, under whose government the people have enjoyed the greatest happiness".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Trench, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; George may not have played a strong role in history, but he was influential at times and he upheld constitutional government.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 138; Cannon; Trench, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Montagu]] said of him, "With him our laws and liberties were safe, he possessed in a great degree the confidence of his people and the respect of foreign governments; and a certain steadiness of character made him of great consequence in these unsettled times&amp;nbsp;... His character would not afford subject for epic poetry, but will look well in the sober page of history."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Black, ''George II'', p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
* {{note|dates|O.S./N.S.}}Over the course of George's life, two calendars were used: the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] [[Julian calendar]] and the [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] [[Gregorian calendar]]. Before 1700, the two calendars were 10 days apart. Hanover switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar on 19 February (O.S.) / 1 March (N.S.) 1700. Great Britain switched on 3/14 September 1752. George was born on 30 October Old Style, which was 9 November New Style, but because the calendar shifted forward a further day in 1700, the date is occasionally miscalculated as 10 November.&lt;ref&gt;Huberty ''et al''., p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; In this article, individual dates before September 1752 are indicated as either O.S. or N.S. or both. All dates after September 1752 are N.S. only. All years are assumed to start from 1 January and not 25 March, which was the English New Year.
* {{note|Hanover|A}}Hanover had about 1,800 houses, whereas London had 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{note|duel|B}}George shook his fist at Newcastle and said "You are a rascal; I shall find you out!", which the duke apparently misheard as "You are a rascal; I shall fight you!"&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

He too was a radio journalist. [[Evany José Metzker]] was decapitated May 2015. Lastly, Djalma Santos da Conceicao was found tortured.

== Impact ==
Gleydson Carvalho was well known for his long-standing, vocal reporting about government corruption.&lt;ref name=inewsguyana&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inewsguyana.com/brazilian-anti-corruption-radio-dj-shot-dead-live-on-air/|title=Brazilian anti-corruption radio DJ shot dead live on air|author=Girendra Persaud|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Carvalho was killed it had created an uproar.

== Reactions ==
[[Irina Bokova]], the director-general of [[UNESCO]], said, "Journalists are the voices of the people and when violence is used to silence one of them, society as a whole suffers. I call on the authorities to investigate this crime and bring its perpetrators to court to be punished in keeping with Brazil's legal provisions."&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|work=UNESCO Press|title=Director-General denounces murder of Brazilian journalist Gleydson Carvalho|date=August 12, 2015|accessdate=2012-10-20|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/director_general_denounces_murder_of_brazialian_journalist_gleydson_carvalho/#.Viaz2PmrRaQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Huronian glaciation''' (or '''Makganyene glaciation''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987113000297|title=Global glaciations and atmospheric change at ca. 2.3 Ga|first1=Haoshu|last1=Tang|first2=Yanjing|last2=Chen|date=1 September 2013|journal=Geoscience Frontiers|volume=4|issue=5|pages=583–596|doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2013.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[glaciation]] that  extended from 2.4 billion years ago (Gya) to 2.1 Gya, during the [[Siderian]] and [[Rhyacian]] periods of the [[Paleoproterozoic]] era. The Huronian glaciation followed the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] (GOE), a time when increased atmospheric oxygen decreased atmospheric [[methane]]. The oxygen combined with the methane to form carbon dioxide and water, which do not retain heat as well as methane does.

It is the oldest and longest [[ice age]], occurring at a time when only simple, unicellular life existed on Earth. This ice age led to a [[Extinction event|mass extinction]] on Earth.

== Discovery and name ==
[[Arthur Philemon Coleman]] first described the geological formations, and their origin in a ''A lower Huronian ice age'' in a 1907 article for the [[American Journal of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coleman|first=A. P.|date=1907-03-01|title=A lower Huronian ice age|url=http://www.ajsonline.org/content/s4-23/135/187|journal=American Journal of Science|language=en|volume=s4-23|issue=135|pages=187–192|doi=10.2475/ajs.s4-23.135.187|issn=0002-9599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bekker|first=Andrey|date=2014|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=1-8|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-27833-4_742-4|title=Encyclopedia of Astrobiology|isbn=978-3-642-27833-4|chapter=Huronian Glaciation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This geological formation, in the geographic area of [[Lake Huron]], consists of two non-glacial [[sediment]] deposits found between three horizons of glacial deposits of the [[Huronian Supergroup]], deposited between 2.5 and 2.2 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Eyles&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eyles|first1=Nicholas|last2=Young|first2=Grant|editor1-last=Deynoux|editor1-first=M.|editor2-last=Miller|editor2-first=J.M.G.|editor3-last=Domack|editor3-first=E.W.|editor4-last=Eyles|editor4-first=N.|editor5-last=Fairchild|editor5-first=I.J.|editor6-last=Young|editor6-first=G.M.|editorlink3=Eugene Domack|title=Geodynamic controls on glaciation in Earth history, in Earth's Glacial Record|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-54803-8|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other evidence===

The [[Gowganda]] [[geological formation|formation]] (2.3&amp;nbsp;Gya) contains "the most widespread and most convincing glaciogenic deposits of this era", according to Eyles and Young.  Similar deposits are found in Michigan (2.1–2&amp;nbsp;Gya), the [[Black Hills]] (2.6–1.6&amp;nbsp;Gya), [[Chibougamau]], [[Canadian Northern Territories]] (2.1&amp;nbsp;Gya) and Wyoming.  Similar age deposits occur in the [[Griquatown, Northern Cape|Griquatown Basin]] (2.3&amp;nbsp;Gya), India (1.8&amp;nbsp;Gya) and Australia (2.5—2.0&amp;nbsp;Gya).&lt;ref name=Eyles /&gt;

== Geological context ==
The [[tectonics|tectonic setting]] was one of a [[rifting]] [[continental margin]].  New [[continental crust]] would have resulted in [[chemical weathering]]. This weathering would pull CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; out of the atmosphere, cooling the planet through the reduction in greenhouse effect.

== Causes and effects ==
Before the Huronian Ice Age, most organisms were anaerobic, but around this time, the [[cyanobacteria]] evolved oxygenic photosynthesis. These bacteria were able to reproduce at exponential rates due to their new ecological niche, exploiting the near-limitless energy of the sunlight. Their photosynthesis produced oxygen as a waste product expelled into the air. At first, most of this oxygen was absorbed through the [[Redox|oxidization]] of surface iron and the decomposition of life forms. However, as the population of the cyanobacteria continued to grow, these oxygen sinks became saturated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kopp|first=Robert|date=14 June 2005|title=The Paleoproterozoic snowball Earth: A climate disaster triggered by the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/102/32/11131.full.pdf|journal=PNAS|volume=102|issue=32|pages=11131–6|doi=10.1073/pnas.0504878102|pmid=16061801|pmc=1183582|access-date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had consequences:

{{quote|As oxygen "polluted" the mostly methane atmosphere, a mass extinction occurred of most life forms, which were anaerobic, as oxygen was toxic to them.  

Methane turned from dominant in the atmosphere to a trace gas, as it was oxidized into carbon dioxide and water. A different atmosphere emerged: thinner, with less powerful [[greenhouse gas]], and Earth's temperature dropped (all the more so that [[solar luminosity]] was lower than now at that time). Thus began the Huronian Ice Age.}}

The Huronian Ice Age is thought to be the first time [[Snowball Earth|Earth was completely covered in ice]], and to have practically stopped photosynthesis. 

===Oscillations and the end of the Huronian era===
These formations include interglacial periods. These interglacials, and eventually the end of the glacial era, could be the result of a build-up of [[carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere]] from [[volcanic]] sources, because photosynthetic consumption of this gas was below its production by out-gassing. This would result in an increased [[greenhouse effect]], leading to warming and [[interglacial periods]]. Then photosynthesis would resume, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration would drop sufficiently that glaciation would occur again. Reasons why glaciation did not resume at the end of the Huronian era are still debated.

The '''hypnopompic state''' (or '''hypnopompia''') is the [[state of consciousness]] leading out of [[sleep]], a term coined by the [[psychical researcher]] [[Frederic William Henry Myers|Frederic Myers]]. Its mirror is the [[hypnagogic]] state at sleep onset; though often conflated, the two states are not identical. The hypnagogic state is [[Rationality|rational]] [[waking up|waking]] [[cognition]] trying to make sense of non-linear images and associations; the hypnopompic state is [[emotion]]al and credulous [[dream]]ing cognition trying to make sense of real world [[wikt:stolidity|stolidity]]. They have a different [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] character. Depressed [[frontal lobe]] function in the first few minutes after waking – known as "[[sleep inertia]]" – causes slowed [[reaction time]] and impaired [[short-term memory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tassi|first=Patricia|last2=Muzet|first2=Alain|title=Sleep inertia|url=https://doi.org/10.1053/smrv.2000.0098|journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews|volume=4|issue=4|pages=341–353|doi=10.1053/smrv.2000.0098}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Sleepers often wake confused, or speak without making sense, a phenomenon the [[psychologist]] Peter McKeller calls "hypnopompic speech".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKeller |first=P |title=Abnormal Psychology |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the awakening occurs out of [[rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement]] (REM) sleep, in which most dreams occur, the hypnopompic state is sometimes accompanied by lingering vivid imagery. Some of the creative insights attributed to dreams actually happen in this moment of awakening from REM. In [[Deirdre Barrett]]'s ''[[The Committee of Sleep]]'', [[Margie Profet]]'s McArthur Award-winning biology experiment is shown to be one of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=[[Deirdre Barrett]] The Committee of Sleep NY: W W Norton 2001/2010. | accessdate=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ian Mackendrick Hendry''' (13 January 1931 – 24 December 1984) was an English film, television and stage actor. He was best known for his work on several British TV series of the 1960s and 1970s, including the lead in the first series of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[The Lotus Eaters (TV series)|The Lotus Eaters]]'', as well as for his roles in films such as ''[[The Hill (film)|The Hill]]'' (1965), ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965), ''[[Get Carter]]'' (1971), and ''[[Theatre of Blood]]'' (1973).

==Early years==
Hendry was born in [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]] on 13 January 1931. His father, James Hendry, was born in 1901 in Glasgow. James Hendry earned a degree in Chemistry from Glasgow University before moving to Ipswich in 1924 to take up a graduate position with R &amp; W Paul Ltd. (now [[BOCM Pauls|BOCM Pauls Ltd]]). Ian's mother, Enid (née Rushton), was born in Durham in 1906.  Her father, George Rushton, was an artist and Head of the Ipswich Art School from 1906-29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Rushton - Artist (Grandfather)|url=http://ianhendry.com/george-rushton-artist/paintings|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ian's younger brother, Donald, was born on 15 August 1933. Both Ian and his brother were educated at the [[Ipswich School]] and [[Culford School]], Suffolk. At Culford School, Ian Hendry had a keen interest in sports, particularly boxing, cricket, running and rugby. He was also involved in amateur dramatics at Culford, helping to produce and perform in several school plays.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

==Career==
===1947&amp;ndash;53: career choices and national service===
On leaving school in 1947, aged 16, Hendry initially embarked on a very different career, studying at the College of Estate Management in London. In 1948, he spent a year working for [[Bidwells]] at their Cambridge office. In 1949, Hendry began his [[National Service]] as part of the compulsory [[conscription in the United Kingdom]], which was introduced after the end of World War II in 1945. He spent two years with the 32nd Medium Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]]. During this time, Hendry paced for [[Christopher Chataway]] in athletics and ran his own motorcycle stunt team. On completion of his service he returned to work in Estate Management.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

From 1951-53, Hendry returned to work for [[Bidwells]], but this time he was based in their Edgware office in London. During this period, Hendry re-established his interest in acting, becoming involved in [[Amateur theatre]] through a local amateur dramatics group in Edgware.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

===1953&amp;ndash;55: Central School of Speech and Drama===
By 1953, Hendry had decided that he wanted to change his career and follow his ambition of becoming an actor. In late 1952, he had applied for a place at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]], London, where he was accepted and trained from 1953-55. Contemporaries at the school at that time included [[Judi Dench]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ian Hendry, Judi Dench - Students At Central School Of Speech And Drama|url=http://ianhendry.com|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vanessa Redgrave]], who were both two years below him; [[Wanda Ventham]], his future co-star in the series ''[[The Lotus Eaters (TV series)|The Lotus Eaters]]'', who was in the year below; and [[Jeremy Brett]] and [[Wendy Craig]], who were in the year above him.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

===1955&amp;ndash;59: theatre, television and film work===
His professional acting career began in 1955, working in repertory at the Hornchurch Theatre in Station Lane. He was also seen in Goldoni's ''[[Servant of Two Masters]]'' at the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. In 1957, Hendry spent another season in repertory, performing in several plays at the [[Oxford Playhouse]], Oxford. In December 1957, ''Dinner With The Family'' transferred to the West End, playing at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0376915/otherworks|title=Ian Hendry - Other Works on IMDb|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As his career developed, he gained parts in films including ''[[Up in the World]]'' (1956), ''[[The Secret Place (film)|The Secret Place]]'' (1957) and ''[[Room at the Top (1959 film)|Room at the Top]]'' (1959).

===1960&amp;ndash;69: theatre, television and film work===
In 1960, Hendry had a part in ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'' (1960), before landing the lead role of Dr Geoffrey Brent in the crime series ''[[Police Surgeon (UK TV series)|Police Surgeon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loureviews.wordpress.com/2012/02/11/ian-hendry|title=Ian Hendry - The Original Avenger|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://declassified.theavengers.tv/keel_main.htm|title=The Avengers, Keel and Steed - The Doctor and the Spy|accessdate=30 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103091908/http://declassified.theavengers.tv/keel_main.htm|archivedate=3 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The series only ran for 12 episodes but Hendry was next cast in the very similar role of Dr David Keel in a new action-adventure series entitled ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''. Initially, Hendry was the star of this series, which co-starred [[Patrick Macnee]] as [[John Steed]]. However, production of the first season was curtailed by a strike and Hendry used the opportunity to depart the series and begin a film career. (''The Avengers'' continued for the rest of the decade with Macnee as its star.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://declassified.theavengers.tv/keel_main.htm|title=The Avengers - Ian Hendry Bio|accessdate=30 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103091908/http://declassified.theavengers.tv/keel_main.htm|archivedate=3 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendry had a lead role in films such as ''[[Girl in the Headlines]]'' (1963), ''[[The Hill (film)|The Hill]]'' (1965) opposite [[Sean Connery]], and [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965). He starred in [[Gerry Anderson]]'s film, ''[[Doppelgänger (1969 film)|Doppelgänger]]'' (1969), also known as ''Journey to the Far Side of the Sun''. During the 1960s he appeared in TV series such as ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', ''[[Danger Man]]'', ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' and ''The Gold Robbers''. He played the lead role as disbarred Queen's Counsel Alex Lambert in the TV series ''The Informer'' (1966–67).{{cn|date=October 2016}}

===1970&amp;ndash;79: theatre, television and film work===
In the early 1970s, Hendry took lead roles in several TV series such as ''[[The Adventures of Don Quick]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Lotus Eaters (TV series)|The Lotus Eaters]]'' (1972–73). He guest starred, alongside [[Brian Blessed]], in the first episode of ''[[The Sweeney]]'', titled "Ringer", made in 1974 and broadcast early in 1975. He appeared regularly as a guest star in TV series such as ''[[The Persuaders!]]'', ''[[Dial M For Murder]]'', ''[[Churchill's People]]'', ''[[Thriller (UK TV series)|Thriller]]'', ''[[Van der Valk (TV series)|Van Der Valk]]'', ''[[Supernatural (1977 TV series)|Supernatural]]'', ''[[Crown Court (TV series)|Crown Court]]'', ''[[The Enigma Files]]'', ''[[Bergerac (TV series)|Bergerac]]'' and ''[[The Chinese Detective]]''. Hendry was reunited with [[Patrick Macnee]] as a guest star on ''[[The New Avengers (TV series)|The New Avengers]]'', although he did not reprise the role of David Keel. His previous role in the series was acknowledged, however, by Steed's parting words: "It may be seventeen years late, but welcome back Gunner." {{cn|date=December 2016}}

He appeared in a number of films, including the [[Hammer]] entry ''[[Captain Kronos – Vampire Hunter]]'' (1974). Among the more widely seen films he appeared in during this time were ''[[Get Carter]]'' (1971), for which he received a [[BAFTA]] nomination for Best Supporting Actor, ''[[Theatre of Blood]]'' (1973) opposite [[Vincent Price]], ''[[The Passenger (1975 film)|The Passenger]]'' (1975) and ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'' (1978).{{cn|date=December 2016}}

===1980&amp;ndash;84: television and film work===
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2016}}
Hendry starred opposite [[Nyree Dawn Porter]] in the TV series ''For Maddie With Love'' (1980). In 1980 Hendry starred in the film [[McVicar (film)|McVicar]] based on bank robber [[John McVicar]] (played by [[Roger Daltrey]] of rock band [[The Who]]). Towards the end of his life he had a role in the crime series ''[[Jemima Shore|Jemima Shore Investigates]]'' as the eponymous heroine's literary agent. His final TV role was in the [[Channel Four]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Brookside]]'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eadt.co.uk/what-s-on/suffolk-the-actor-who-should-have-been-a-star-1-1973100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2016}}
Hendry's first marriage was to Phyllis J. Bell in September 1955, a make-up artist who worked for Leichner, whom he first met when he began work in repertory theatre. The marriage ended in 1962. He married actress [[Janet Munro]] on 16 February 1963. They had two daughters, Sally and Corrie, but their turbulent life together ended in divorce in 1971. Munro died a year later in London from the heart condition [[myocarditis]]. This was a contributory factor in Hendry's increasing dependence on alcohol. Hendry later married Sandra (Sandy) Jones on 27 May 1975, with whom he had another daughter, Emma.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eadt.co.uk/what-s-on/suffolk-the-actor-who-should-have-been-a-star-1-1973100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Hendry was declared bankrupt in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://declassified.theavengers.tv/keel_main.htm|title=The Avengers - Ian Hendry profile|accessdate=30 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103091908/http://declassified.theavengers.tv/keel_main.htm|archivedate=3 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered from several health problems in his latter years, largely due to his long-term problems with alcohol which affected his professional and personal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabotagetimes.com/tv-film/the-ten-hardest-drinking-british-actors-ever|title=The Ten Hardest Drinking British Actors Ever|publisher=sabotagetimes.com |date=4 December 2013|accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Russell|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/what-s-on/suffolk_the_actor_who_should_have_been_a_star_1_1973100|title=Suffolk: The actor ‘who should have been a star’|publisher=Eadt.co.uk|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His last part in a film was a substantial, though uncredited, role as a corrupt policeman in ''[[McVicar (film)|McVicar]]''. His last public appearance was as a guest on ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' which profiled former co-star Macnee, who had been a special guest when ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' featured Hendry in March 1978.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Death==
On [[Christmas Eve]] 1984, Hendry died of a [[gastrointestinal hemorrhage]] in [[London]], aged 53. He was cremated and his ashes interred in the Lily Pond beds at the [[Golders Green Crematorium]].{{cn|date=October 2016}}

'''John Edward "Jack" Reagan''' (July 13, 1883 – May 18, 1941) was the father of radio station manager [[Neil Reagan]] (1908–1996) and [[Ronald Reagan]] (1911–2004), [[motion picture]] [[actor]], 33rd [[Governor of California]], and 40th [[President of the United States of America]]

==Ancestry==
Jack's paternal grandfather, Michael O'Regan, was a native of [[County Tipperary]], Ireland.  O'Regan worked as a tenant farmer during his early years in Ireland, before he moved to [[London]] in 1852.  O'Regan married an Irish refugee, Catherine Mulcahey, in London and anglicised his family surname as "Reagan".  The Reagans relocated to [[Carroll County, Illinois]] in 1856.&lt;ref name="Gullan320"&gt;Gullan (2001), p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; John Michael, their son, became a grain-elevator farmer, and married Jenny Cusick in 1878. Cusick was born in Canada, but like John Michael, her parents came from Ireland. Their son, John Edward "Jack", was born five years later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=aejjAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22a+grain-elevator+worker+who+lived+in+nearby+Fulton%22&amp;dq=%22a+grain-elevator+worker+who+lived+in+nearby+Fulton%22 ''The New Yorker'', Volume 57, Issues 37-41], 1981, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jalal Alamgir''' (17 January 1971 – 3 December 2011), was a Bangladeshi-American academic and an associate professor of political science at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston|University of Massachusetts-Boston]] and the son of [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] Member of Parliament [[Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir]]. He specialised in the inter-relationships between globalisation and representational politics. He died in a drowning accident in Thailand on 3 December 2011.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dr Jalal Alamgir drowns in sea in Thailand |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=212865 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=4 December 2011 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Riaz |first=Ali |date=5 December 2011 |title=My Friend Jalal Alamgir |url=http://www.prothom-alo.com/detail/date/2011-12-05/news/206405 |newspaper=Prothom Alo |language=bn |accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Alamgir held a Ph.D. from [[Brown University]]. He was a tenured faculty at [[University of Massachusetts Boston|University of Massachusetts-Boston]], holding the position of associate professor of political science. He was also a fellow at the South Asia Initiative at [[Harvard University]]. Prior to joining UMass, Alamgir held research appointments at the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University, the Southern Asian Institute at [[Columbia University]], and the [[Centre for Policy Research]], New Delhi. Aside from his research, he consulted for the [[United Nations Population Fund]] and strategy consulting organizations.&lt;ref name=universitybio&gt;{{cite web |last=Alamgir |first=Jalal |title=Jalal Alamgir |url=http://www.umb.edu/academics/cla/faculty/jalal_alamgir/ |work=College of Liberal Arts Faculty |publisher=University of Massachusetts Boston |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death, Alamgir was working on several research projects: political violence and justice in Bangladesh and Pakistan, foreign policy of Bangladesh, the representation of values in Indian foreign policy, and the relationship between authoritarianism and globalization in Myanmar.&lt;ref name="universitybio" /&gt;

In addition to his academic career, Alamgir was a principal at Red Bridge Strategy, Inc., which he described as a consultancy he co-founded "to help organizations globalize their operations with locally and {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}informed strategies." Describing the relationship between his academic and consulting work, he said, "The university involves me with cutting-edge research and blue-sky thinking, and I get to meet many scholars and students– wonderful, eccentric, motivated– all helping us to understand the world better. At Red Bridge Strategy, I get to try out some of the ideas I develop in academia, applying them to real world problems and puzzles that need to be 'solved' within a limited time, limited resources, and with a pragmatic approach."&lt;ref name="birthplace" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Leadership|url=http://www.redbridgestrategy.com/content/view/18/42/|work=Red Bridge Strategy|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Belchier''' (1706 &amp;ndash; 6 February 1785) was a [[British people|British]] [[surgery|surgeon]] at [[Guy's Hospital]] from 1736 to 1768. He discovered at about the time of his Guy's appointment that the vegetable dye [[Rose madder|madder]] stained newly forming bone tissue, opening up the study of the growth and development of the skeleton, which was taken forward by
[[Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau]] and [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]].

Belchier was awarded the [[Copley Medal]] by the [[Royal Society]] in 1737. He was a founding governor for the [[Foundling Hospital]], a charity created by [[Royal Charter]] in 1739, and was a member of the Court of Assistants at the Company of Surgeons from 1751 to 1785.

'''Kosmos 110''' ({{lang-ru|Космос 110}} meaning '''Cosmos 110''') was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[spacecraft]] launched on 22 February 1966 from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] aboard a [[Voskhod rocket]]. It carried two dogs, [[Soviet space dogs#Veterok and Ugolyok|Veterok and Ugolyok]].

== Mission ==

It incorporated a re-entry body (capsule) for landing scientific instruments and test objects. It was a biological satellite that made a sustained [[biomedical]] experiment through the [[Van Allen radiation belts]] with the dogs [[Soviet space dogs#Veterok and Ugolyok|Veterok and Ugolyok]]. On March 16, after 22 days in orbit around the Earth, they were safely landed.&lt;ref&gt;NASA National Space Science Data Center: [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1966-015A Cosmos 110]&lt;/ref&gt;

This spaceflight of record-breaking duration was not surpassed by humans until [[Soyuz 11]] in June 1971, and still stands as the longest space flight by dogs.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

'''Laurentius Abstemius''' (c.1440-1508) was an Italian writer and professor of philology, born at [[Macerata]] in [[Ancona]]. His learned name plays on his family name of Bevilaqua (Drinkwater), and he was also known by the Italian name '''Lorenzo Astemio'''. A [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]] writer of considerable talents at the time of the [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] revival of letters, his first published works appeared in the 1470s and were distinguished by minute scholarship. During that decade he moved to [[Urbino]] and became ducal librarian, although he was to move between there and other parts of Italy thereafter as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;“Lorenzo Astemio”, [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/lorenzo-astemio_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29 ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani'' - Volume 4 (1962)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The work for which he is principally remembered now is ''Hecatomythium'' (1495), a collection of a hundred fables written in Latin and largely of his own invention. However, the inclusion together with this work of the thirty-three Aesopic fables translated from the Greek by [[Lorenzo Valla]] gave the impression that his own work was of the same kind. Several of the fables of Abstemius, it is true, relate to [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's]] in various ways, either as variations on his, as in the case of ''De culice cibum et hospitium ab appetente'' (94), which is told of a gnat and a bee but relates to [[The Ant and the Grasshopper]]; or in the case of ''De leone et mure'' (52) it provides a sequel to [[The Lion and the Mouse]], in which the mouse asks for the lion's daughter as a reward for freeing him from the net and is stepped on accidentally by the bride.

Still other fables, in the Aesopic manner, provide a frame for proverbs: for example '[[Still waters run deep]]' (''De rustico amnem transituro'', 5) and '[[The Oxen and the Creaking Cart|The worse the wheel, the more it creaks]]' (''De auriga et rota currus stridente'', 84). But some quarter of Abstemius' stories belong to the genre of comic anecdotes associated with [[Poggio Bracciolini]] and known as ''Facetiae''. One at least, ''De vidua virum petente'' (the widow seeking a husband, 31), borrows directly from the collection of Poggio.&lt;ref&gt;Tiphaine Rolland, «Le destin facétieux des fables, d’Abstemius à La Fontaine », in ''Itérances de la Fable'', ''Le Fablier'' 2015, [https://www.academia.edu/18871740/2015_-_Le_destin_fac%C3%A9tieux_des_fables_dAbstemius_%C3%A0_La_Fontaine_Le_Fablier._Revue_des_Amis_de_Jean_de_La_Fontaine_ISSN_0996-6560_n_26_2015_p._53-85 pp.57-8]&lt;/ref&gt; A few of these sorts of fable particularly were condemned as ludicrous and licentiously critical of the clergy&lt;ref&gt;A citation of Desbillons' ''Fabulae Aesopiae'' is quoted [http://aesopus.pbworks.com/w/page/1471359/abstemius online]&lt;/ref&gt; and the work was added to the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Vatican index of forbidden books]]. Abstemius later wrote a further 97 fables in a less extreme vein, ''Hecatomythium Secundum'', published in Venice in 1499.

The fables of Abstemius were frequently reprinted in their own right, as well as added to other collections of Aesopic material, during the 16th century. In particular they can be found annexed to an edition of Aesop's Fables, published in eight volumes at [[Frankfurt]] in 1580, and were later translated very idiomatically by [[Roger L'Estrange]] in his ''Fables of Aesop and Other Eminent Mythologists'' (1692).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/lestrange/index.htm Fables 255–351]&lt;/ref&gt; Translated into French as ''Hécatomythium ou les fables de Laurent Abstemius traduit du latin'' (Orléans, 1572), they were the source for several in the later books of  [[La Fontaine's Fables]], including "[[The Vultures and the Pigeons]]” (VII.8), “Death and the Dying Man” (VIII.1) and “[[The Women and the Secret]]” (VIII.6).

{{nihongo|'''Michiko Kanba'''|樺 美智子|Kanba Michiko|November 8, 1937 – June 15, 1960}} was a [[University of Tokyo]] undergraduate and a [[Zengakuren]] activist. She died in clashes between demonstrators and police at the South Gate of the [[National Diet Building]] in central Tokyo. She is buried in [[Tama Cemetery]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6617406/michiko-kanba|title=Find a Grave|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism and writing ==
Michiko Kanba was born in Tokyo. Her father was [[Toshio Kanba]], a sociologist and professor at [[Chuo University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www6.plala.or.jp/guti/cemetery/PERSON/K/kanba_t.html|title=樺俊雄の墓|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanba was raised in a middle-class Christian household, and entered University of Tokyo in 1957 and joined the [[Japanese Communist Party|Japan Communist Party]] on November of that year. After that, she became a leader in the New Left organization Bund and participated in mass demonstrations against the revisions of the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Sensô taiken" no sengoshi sedai, kyôyô, ideorogii「戦争体験」の戦後史 世代・教養・イデオロギー|last=Fukuma|first=Yoshiaki|publisher=Chûkô shinsho|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanba was one of the 76 student activists who were arrested at a January 26, 1960 sit-in at [[Haneda Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gekidô Showashi genba kenshô: sengo jiken fairu 22 「激動昭和史現場検証 戦後事件ファイル22」|last=Gôda|first=Ichidô|publisher=Shinpûsha|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also participated in protests around the Diet Building. She was killed just inside the South Gate of the [[National Diet Building]] after a group of students broke into the gate and clashed with riot police.

After her death, Kanba's personal writings and political essays were collected and published under the title "The Smile Nobody Knows" (Japanese: 人しれず微笑もん).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hito shirezu hohoemon 「人しれず微笑もん」|last=Kanba|first=Michiko|publisher=San'ichi shinsho|year=1960|isbn=|location=Tokyo|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her writings, she discusses her life and activism.

== Legacy ==
Kanba's death was widely covered at the time, and is seen as a symbol of the 1960 mass protests against the revised [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan]]. A political cartoon that ran in the popular journal ''Sekai'' a month after Kanba's death depicted a [[yakuza]] gangster lighting a cigarette for a policeman as they both stand over her dead body in front of the National Diet Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siniawer|first=Eiko Maruko|date=2013|year=2013|editor-last=Bridenthal|editor-first=Renate|title=Befitting Bedfellows|url=|journal=The Hidden History of Crime, Corruption, and States|publisher=Berghahn Books|volume=|pages=112|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eiji Oguma]] has contended that Kanba's death evoked recent memories of the many young people who lost their lives in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Minshu to aikoku: sengo Nihon no nashonarizumu to kōkyōsei (Democracy and Patriotism: Nationalism and Community in Postwar Japan)|last=Oguma|first=Eiji|publisher=Shinyōsha|year=2002|isbn=|location=Tokyo|pages=530–539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiroko Hirakawa framed Kanba's posthumous status as a "maiden martyr" as reflecting contemporary expectations about middle-class femininity and motherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirakawa|first=Hiroko|date=|year=2017|title=Maiden Martyr for "New Japan": The 1960 Ampo and the Rhetoric of the Other Michiko|url=|journal=U.S.-Japan Women's Journal|volume=51|pages=12–27|via=Project Muse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea Szendi Schieder argues that the global 1960s began in Japan with Kanba's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mronline.org/2010/06/15/two-three-many-1960s/|title=Two, Three, Many 1960s|last=Schieder|first=Chelsea Szendi|date=2010|website=Monthly Review Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monogenes''' has two primary definitions, "pertaining to being the only one of its kind within a specific relationship" and "pertaining to being the only one of its kind or class, unique in kind".&lt;ref&gt;Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (BAGD, 3rd Edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''monogenēs'' (μονογενὴς) may be used both as an [[adjective]] ''monogenēs pais'', meaning unique and special.&lt;ref&gt;White, The Forgotten Trinity [Minneapolis, MN, Bethany House Publishers, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Its Greek meaning is often applied to mean "one of a kind, one and only". ''Monogenēs'' (μονογενὴς) may be used both as an [[adjective]] ''monogenēs pais'', only child, or only legitimate child, special child, and also on its own as a [[noun]]; ''o monogenēs'' "the only one", or "the only legitimate child".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Murphy, Background To The Bible, Servant Publications, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The word is used in Hebrews 11:17-19 to describe [[Isaac]], the son of [[Abraham]]. However, Isaac was not the only-begotten son of Abraham, but was the chosen, having special virtue.

The term is notable outside normal Greek usage in two special areas: in the cosmology of [[Plato]] and in the [[Gospel of John]]. As concerns the use by Plato there is broad academic consensus, generally following the understanding of the philosopher [[Proclus]] (412–485 AD).

==Lexical entry==
In [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] of [[Henry Liddell|Liddell]] &amp; [[Charles Scott Sherrington|Scott]] the following main definition is given:

:A. the only member of a kin or kind: hence, generally, only, single, "child" (''pais'', παῖς) [[Hesiod]], ''[[Works and Days]]'' 376; [[Herodotus]] ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 7.221; cf. [[Gospel of John]] 1.14; [[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' 32.1; Hesiod ''[[Theogony]]'', concerning [[Hecate]].
:2. unique, of (to on, τὸ ὄν), [[Parmenides]] 8.4; “εἷς ὅδε μ. οὐρανὸς γεγονώς” [[Plato]] [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]].31b, cf. [[Proclus]] ''Institutio Theologica'' 22; “θεὸς ὁ μ.” [[Friedrich Preisigke]]'s ''Sammelbuch'' 4324.15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmonogenh%2Fs LSJ Dictionary Entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical example:
:"The Egyptians told me that Maneros was the '''only son''' of their first king, who died prematurely, and this dirge was sung by the Egyptians in his honor; and this, they said, was their earliest and their only chant." ([[Herodotus]] ''Histories'' 2:79)&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, with an English translation by A. D. Godley. Cambridge. Harvard University Press. 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;
But note that this example does not necessarily rule out sons by concubines.

==Usage in Greek texts==

===Classical Greek texts===
The following examples are taken from the [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/searchresults?all_words=monogenh/s&amp;all_words_expand=yes&amp;la=greek Greek text uses of ''monogenēs'' in the Perseus database].

* Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 426 "Also, because she is an only child (''monogenēs''), the goddess Hecate receives not less honor, … 446 So even though she is her mother’s only child (''monogenēs'') "Hecate is honored amongst all the immortal gods."
* Hesiod, ''Works and Days'' 375 "There should be an only son (''monogenes'') to feed his father’s house, for so wealth will increase in the home; but if you leave a second son you should die old."
* Herodotus 2.79.3 "Maneros was the only-born (''monogenes'') of their first king, who died prematurely,"
* Herodotus 7.221.1 "[[Megistias]] sent to safety his only-born (''o monogenes'', as noun) who was also with the army."
* Plato, ''Laws'' 3, 691e: [[List of speakers in Plato's dialogues|The Athenian stranger to Megillus and Clinias]]: "To begin with, there was a god watching over you; and he, foreseeing the future, restricted within due bounds the royal power by making your kingly line no longer single (''monogenes'') but twofold. In the next place, some man, ([[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Lycurgus]]) in whom human nature was blended with power divine, observing your government to be still swollen with fever, blended the self-willed force."&lt;ref&gt;Plato in Twelve Volumes, Vols. 10 &amp; 11 translated by [[Robert Gregg Bury|R.G. Bury]]. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1967 &amp; 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plato, ''Critias'' 113d, The Story of Atlantis: "Evenor with his wife Leucippe; and they had for offspring an only-begotten (''monogene'') daughter, Cleito."&lt;ref&gt;Plato in Twelve Volumes, Vol. 9 translated by W.R.M. Lamb. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plato, ''Timaeus'' 31b "one only-begotten Heaven (''monogenes ouranos'') created."
* Plato, ''Timaeus'' 92c "the one only-begotten Heaven (''monogenes ouranos'')."
* [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''Argonautica'' 3:1007: "And propitiate only-begotten Hecate, daughter of [[Perses (Titan)|Perses]]"

An exhaustive listing of ''monogenēs'' can be found in the ''[[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]]'' database.

'''Parmenides'''
The reference above found in Liddell Scott, and therefore in other lexicons, and unquestioned in Christian commentaries, to a use of ''monogenes'' by Parmenides has more recently been shown to probably be incorrect. The text of Parmenides 8. 4 is "unusually corrupt".&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4032296 John R. Wilson Classic Quarterly article]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] read the text as ''holomeles'' (οὐλομελές, "whole-limbed"). The original reconstruction by H. Diels (1897) left the text open.&lt;ref&gt;Diels, Hermann. ''Parmenides Lehrgedicht: griechisch und deutsch'' Berlin, Reimer. 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; Later editions of Diels-Kranz&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker''&lt;/ref&gt; defer to Plutarch's reading in the reconstructed [http://philoctetes.free.fr/parmenidesunicode.htm Greek text]. Others since reconstructed the text as ''monogenes'' (only-begotten) but John R. Wilson (1970) argues that this is inconsistent with context&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Wilson. ''Parmenides, B8.4'', in ''Classical Quarterly'' n.20 (1970) p32-34&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests the text as ''monomeles'' (one-limbed). The inconsistency is accepted by H. Schmitz (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Schmitz, Hermann. Der Ursprung des Gegenstandes. Von Parmenides bis Demokrit. Bonn: Bouvier Verlag, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; but Schmitz proposes instead a return to ''holomeles'' (οὐλομελές, "whole-limbed").
* Parmenides B.8:4 "[..] being unborn is undestroyable, for it is ''holomeles/monogenes/monomeles'' and unshakable and endless;"&lt;ref&gt;Guido Rappe ''Archaische Leiberfahrung. der Leib in der frühgriechischen Philosophie und in aussereuropäischen Kulturen.'' 1995, Akademie Verlag p.149&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interpretation of Classical Greek usage====
[[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] speaks twice of a ''monogenes'' Heaven:

* Timaeus 31b, "In order then that [the world] might be solitary, like the perfect animal, [the creator] made not two worlds (cosmos) or an infinite number of them; but there is and ever will be one only-begotten heaven (ouranos) created."&lt;ref&gt;[31b] ἵνα οὖν τόδε κατὰ τὴν μόνωσιν ὅμοιον ᾖ τῷ παντελεῖ ζῴῳ͵ διὰ ταῦτα οὔτε δύο οὔτ΄ ἀπείρους ἐποίησεν ὁ ποιῶν κόσμους͵ ἀλλ΄ εἷς ὅδε μονογενὴς οὐρανὸς γεγονὼς ἔστιν καὶ ἔτ΄ ἔσται.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/physis/plato-timaeus/genesis.asp?pg=4 Timaeus Parallel English-Greek text 31b]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Timaeus 92c "We may now say that our discourse about the nature of the universe has an end. The world has received animals, mortal and immortal, and is fulfilled with them, and has become a visible animal containing the visible-the sensible God who is the image of the intellectual, the greatest, best, fairest, most perfect-the one only begotten heaven.&lt;ref&gt;μέγιστος καὶ ἄριστος κάλλιστός τε καὶ τελεώτατος γέγονεν εἷς οὐρανὸς ὅδε μονογενὴς ὤν.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Parallel English-Greek text 92c]&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject is the creation, or begetting, of heaven (''ouranos'') as a unique birth, not the birth of more than one cosmos. Comparison is also made with the begetting of animals and birds from the souls of "light-minded men".&lt;ref&gt;T. K. Johansen ''Plato's natural philosophy: a study of the Timaeus-Critias'' 2004 Page 190&lt;/ref&gt;

In commentary on Plato [[Proclus]] considers that if a visible god like the ''ouranos'' is to resemble higher invisible gods, then the visible cosmos must be ''monogenes''.&lt;ref&gt;Proclus, edition Dirk Baltzly ''Commentary on Plato's Timaeus: Book 3, Part 1 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek Old Testament usage===
The word occurs five times in the [[Septuagint]]:
* Judges 11:34 "she was his (i.e. [[Jephtha]]'s) only child (''e monogenes'', female)"
* Psalm 22:20 "deliver my soul from the sword, my only begotten (life?) from the hand of the dog."
* Psalm 25:16 "I am an only child (''monogenes'') and poor."
* Psalm 35:17 "deliver my soul from their mischief, my only begotten (life?) from the lions."
* Jeremiah 6:26 "as one mourns for an only child (''monogenes'')"
* Tobit 8.17 "they were both an only child (''duo monogeneis'', of two different parents)
* [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]] 7:22 "there is in her (i.e. Wisdom) a spirit quick of understanding, holy, as an only child (''monogenes''), manifold."

====Interpretation of Greek Old Testament usage====
Psalm 22:20, 35:17 and Wisdom 7:22 appear to be personifications of the soul (in Hebrew a masculine noun) and wisdom (feminine noun) as an "only son" and "only daughter" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Lust, J., Eynikel, E., &amp; Hauspie, K. (2003). ''A Greek-English Lexicon of the Septuagint'': Revised Edition. Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft: Stuttgart: "μονογενής,-ής,-ές+ A 0-2-0-3-9=14 Jgs 11,34; Ps 21 (22),21; 24 (25),16; 34 (35),17 the only member of a kin, only-begotten, only (of children) Jgs 11,34; id. (of God) Od 14,13; alone in its kind, one only Wis 7,22 Cf. HARL 1960=1992a 206–207; 1986a 192; LARCHER 1984, 482–483; →MM; NIDNTT; TWNT"&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an increase in the use of ''monogenes'' in later versions of the Septuagint. Gen 22:2 "the beloved one whom you have loved" (''ton agapeton, on egapesas'') in Aquila's Greek translation uses ''monogenēs'' to translate ''yachid'', the common Hebrew word for "only".&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Biblical literature, Volumes 70-72 1970 p217&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek New Testament usage===
The New Testament contains 9 uses, all adjectival:
* Luke 7:12 "her only son (''o monogenes uios'')"
* Luke 8:42 "only daughter (''e monogenes thugater'')"
* Luke 9:38 "only son (''o monogenes uios'')"
* John 1:14 "only begotten" (monogenes)
* John 1:18 textual variation in manuscripts: a. "only begotten" God (''monogenes theos'' / b. "the only begotten Son" (''o monogenes uios'')
* [[John 3:16]] "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son (''o monogenes uios'')"
* John 3:18 "he has not believed in the name of God’s only son (''o monogenes uios'')"
* Heb.11:17 "only-legitimate son (''o monogenes uios'')" – since [[Abraham]] also fathered [[Ishmael]], from the slave girl [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]], and six other sons, from [[Keturah]].
* 1 John 4:9 "God sent his only Son (''o monogenes uios'') into the world"

===Hellenistic Jewish usages===
* Josephus, [[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]] 2.181 "Dan had an only child (''monogenes pais''), Usi."
* Josephus, Antiquities 2.263 "Jephtha’s daughter, she was also an only-born (''monogenes'') and a virgin"
* Josephus, Antiquities 20.20 "Monobazus, the king of Abiadene… had an elder brother, by Helena also, as he had other sons by other wives besides. But he openly placed all his affections on this his favourite son (''monogenes'') Izates, which was the origin of the envy which his other brethren, by the same father, bore to him; and on this account they hated him more and more, and were all under great affliction that their father should prefer Izates before them."
* [[Psalms of Solomon]] 18:4 : "Thy chastisement comes upon us (in love) as the first born (''prototokos'') and the only begotten son (''monogenes'')."&lt;ref&gt;Büchsel TDNT notes [[2 Esdras|4 Esdras]] 6:58 :With this may be compared 4 Esr. 6:58 : 'But we, thy people, whom thou hast called the first born, the only begotten, the dearest friend, are given up into their hands.'" Here Büchsel is referring to the Latin text of Fourth Esdras (also called Second Esdras), a book for which there is no extant Greek text.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Patristic usage===
* Clement of Rome 25 – "the phoenix is the only one [born] (''monogenes'') of its kind"
* [[Nicene Creed]] - "And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God."
* [[Macarius Magnes]] 403AD. ''The Monogenes'', title of a treatise.

===Gnosticism and magic texts===
Platonic usage also impacted Christian usage, for example in [[Gnosticism]]. In Tertullian's ''Against the [[Valentinianism|Valentinians]]'', he gives the name to one of their thirty [[aeons]] as ''monogenes'' in a [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|syzygy]] with ''makaria'', Blessedness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Phillip Smith]] ''A Dictionary of Gnosticism'' 2009 Page 163&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Friedrich Preisigke]]'s ''Sammelbuch'' (1922) 4324,15 contains a 3rdC. AD magic invocation by an Egyptian girl called Capitolina placing a papyrus in a box to invoke various gods, pagan, Jewish and Christian, including "Iao Sabaoth Barbare..., God in Heaven, the Only-Begotten" to help her cast a love potion on a young man called Nilos:
:"I summon you divinities by the bitter necessities that bind you and by those carried away by the wind IO IOE PHTHOUTH EIO PHRE. The Greatest Divinity YAH SABAOTH BARBARE THIOTH LAILAMPS OSORNOPHRI EMPHERA, to God in the heavens, the only-begotten (ho Monogenes) who shakes the depths, sending out the waves and the wind. Thrust forth the spirits of these divinities wherever the box... "&lt;ref&gt;"285. Charm to bind Capitolina's lover Nilos to her" PGM XV1-21 Provenance unknown 3rd Century AD. ''Women and society in Greek and Roman Egypt: a sourcebookBy Jane Rowlandson p.360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Λαιλαμψ Οσορνοφρι Βαρβαρε εν τω ουρανω θεος, ο μονογενης" F. Büchsel, ''Hinweis auf einen Liebeszauber'' ThWNT IV p746.&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar content is found in:
*Karl Preisendanz ''[[Greek Magical Papyri]]'' (1973) Vol.1 p124.&lt;ref&gt;"εισακουσον μου, ο εις, μονογενης"&lt;/ref&gt;
*R. Wunsch ''Antike Fluchtafeln'' (Ancient Curse Tablets, 1912) 4,36.&lt;ref&gt;Strecker G. ''Die Johannesbriefe'' p.233 "ορκιζωσε τον θεον... τον μονογην τον εξ αυτου αναφανεντα"&lt;/ref&gt;
The problem with magical inscriptions, on papyri, walls or ostraca, is firstly dating the source, secondly that magical spells by their nature tend to be [[syncretic]]. In the example above lovestruck Capitolina summons "all the divinities" to release the spirits of "all who drowned in the Nile, the unmarried dead" etc. to sway the heart of her young man, yet she may not have known enough about Judaism or Christianity, or even Gnostic Christianity, to know whether "YAHWEH SABAOTH" and "the Only-Begotten" were the same god or not.

===Later uses in Christianity===
* a [[troparion]], ''[[O Monogenes Yios]]'', "Only Begotten Son," ascribed to [[Justinian I]] (527 - 565)
* in Latin: ''[[Unigenitus]]'', a [[papal bull]] issued by [[Pope Clement VI]] in 1343.

==Interpretation of New Testament usage==

Some aspects of the meaning, or range of meanings, of ''monogenēs'' in the New Testament are disputed. Lexicons of the New Testament both reflect and determine debate:
* [[Bauer lexicon|Bauer BDAG]]&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, W., Danker, Friedrich W., &amp; Bauer, W. (2000). ''[[Bauer lexicon|A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature]]'' (3rd ed.) (658). Chicago: University of Chicago Press: "See also Hdb. on vs. 18 where, beside the rdg. μονογενὴς θεός (considered by many the orig.) an only-begotten one, God (acc. to his real being; i.e. uniquely divine as God’s son and transcending all others alleged to be gods) or a uniquely begotten deity (for the perspective s. J 10:33–36), another rdg. ὁ μονογενὴς υἱός is found. MPol 20:2 in the doxology διὰ παιδὸς αὐτοῦ τοῦ μονογενοῦς Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ. Some (e.g. WBauer, Hdb.; JBulman, ''[[Calvin Theological Journal]]'' 16, ’81, 56–79; JDahms, ''[[New Testament Studies|NTS]]'' 29, ’83, 222–32) prefer to regard μ. as somewhat heightened in mng. in J and 1J to only-begotten or begotten of the Only One, in view of the emphasis on γεννᾶσθαι ἐκ θεοῦ (J 1:13 al.); in this case it would be analogous to πρωτότοκος (Ro 8:29; Col 1:15 al.)."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kittel TDNT&lt;ref&gt;Theological Dictionary of the New Testament edited by Gerhard Kittel, English edition (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1967), pp. 737-41. [http://www.bible-researcher.com/monogenes.html Hermann Martin Friedrich Büchsel on μονογενής (and 1 of 14 footnotes)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Balz EDNT&lt;ref&gt;Balz, Horst R., &amp; Schneider, Gerhard. (1990-). Vol. 2: Exegetical dictionary of the New Testament (440). Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans: "Μονογενής means only in all the Lukan passages. In 7:12 (L) it is used of the son born to the widow of Nain. The Gospel writer has inserted μονογενής in 8:42 in the account of the healing of Jairus’s daughter (cf. Mark 5:23: τὸ θυγάτριόν μου) and in 9:38 in the pericope on the epileptic boy (cf. Mark 9:17: τὸν υἱόν μου). In these passages μονογενής intensifies the significance of Jesus’ miracles."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Friberg ALGNT&lt;ref&gt;Friberg, Timothy, Friberg, Barbara, &amp; Miller, Neva F. (2000). Vol. 4: Analytical lexicon of the Greek New Testament. Baker's Greek New Testament library (266). Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Books: "μονογενής, ές of what is the only one of its kind of class unique; (1) an only child born to human parents one and only (LU 7.12; 8.42); substantively only child (LU 9.38); (2) as a child born in a unique way; (a) used of God’s Son Jesus only, only begotten; substantively (JN 1.14); (b) used of Abraham’s son Isaac only; substantively ὁ μ. his only true son (HE 11.17)"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Begetting===
The entrance of "only begotten" into the English Bible was not directly from ''mono-genes'' but from the Latin of the Vulgate, which had ''uni-genitus'' (one-begotten):&lt;ref&gt;David Ewert A general introduction to the Bible: from ancient tablets to modern translations 1990 p230&lt;/ref&gt;

:*John 3:16 ''sic enim dilexit Deus mundum ut Filium suum '''unigenitum''' daret ut omnis qui credit in eum non pereat sed habeat vitam aeternam. (Latin [[Vulgate]])
:*John 3:16 ''God lufede middan-eard swa þæt he sealde hys '''akennedan''' sune þæt nan ne for-wurðe þe on hine ge-lefð. Ac habbe þt eche lyf.'' ([[Hatton Gospels]] c.1160 AD)
:*John 3:16 ''For God lovede so the world, that he yaf his '''oon bigetun''' sone, that each man that bileveth in him perishe not, but have everlastynge lijf.''([[Wycliffe's Bible]] 1395 AD)

The meaning of ''monogenēs'' was part of early Christian [[Christology|christological]] controversy regarding the [[Trinity]]. It is claimed that [[Arianism|Arian]] arguments that used texts that refer to Christ as God's "only begotten Son" are based on a misunderstanding of the Greek word ''monogenēs''&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne A. Grudem]], Jeff Purswell ''Bible Doctrine: Essential Teachings of the Christian Faith'' 1999- Page 113&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Greek word does not mean "begotten" in the sense we beget children but means "having no peer, unique".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Abanes ''Today's Mormonism: Understanding Latter-Day Saints'' 2007 Page 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Dalcour ''A definitive look at oneness theology: defending the tri-unity of God'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively in favour that the word ''monogenēs'' does carry some meaning related to begetting is the etymological origin ''mono-'' (only) + ''-genes'' (born, begotten).&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth L. Barker, Edwin H. Palmer ''The NIV: the making of a contemporary translation'' 1986 p121&lt;/ref&gt; The question is whether the [[etymology|etymological origin]] was still "live" as part of the meaning when the New Testament was written, or whether [[semantic change|semantic shift]] has occurred. Limiting the semantic change of ''monogenes'' is that the normal word ''monos'' is still the default word in New Testament times, and that the terms co-exist in Greek, Latin and English:
:Greek ''monos'' → Latin ''unicus'' → English "only"
:Greek ''monogenes'' → Latin ''unigenitus'' → English "only-begotten"

Also there is a question about how separate from the idea of ''-genes'' birth and begetting the cited uses of ''monogenes'' in the sense of "unique" truly are. For example, the ending ''-genes'' is arguably not redundant even in the sense of "only" as per when [[Pope Clement I|Clement of Rome]] (96 AD), and later [[Origen]], Cyril and others, employ ''monogenes'' to describe the rebirth of the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]. At issue is whether Clement is merely stressing ''monos'' unique, or using ''monogenes'' to indicate unique in its method of rebirth, or possibly that there is only one single bird born and reborn. Likewise in Plato's Timaeus, the "only-begotten and created Heaven", is still unique in how it is begotten, in comparison to the begetting of animals and men, just as Earth and Heaven give birth to Ocean and Tethys. Of the [[A Greek-English Lexicon|Liddell Scott]] references for "unique" (''monogenes'' being used purely as ''monos'') that leaves only Parmenides, which (as above) is no longer considered a likely reading of the Greek text.

Additionally the New Testament frame of reference for ''monogenes'' is established by uses of the main verb "beget", and readings of complementary verses, for example:

:Heb. 1:5 "For unto which of the angels said he at any time, "Thou art my Son (''uios mou ei su''), this day have I begotten thee (''ego semeron gegenneka se'')"? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?" (citing Ps.2:7, also cited Acts 13:33, Heb.5:5)

:1 John 5:18 "We know that '''everyone''' who is begotten of God does not sin" '''or'''
:1 John 5:18 "We know that '''the One''' who is begotten of God does not sin" &lt;ref&gt;Kittel TDNT Büchsel on μονογενής Op. cit. "It is not wholly clear whether μονογενής in Jn. denotes also the birth or begetting from God; it probably does, Jn. calls Jesus ὁ γεννηθεὶς ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ, 1 Jn. 5:18. Though many will not accept this, he here understands the concept of sonship in terms of begetting. For him to be the Son of God is not just to be the recipient of God's love. It is to be begotten of God. This is true both of believers and also of Jesus. For this reason μονογενής probably includes also begetting by God. To be sure, Jn. does not lift the veil of mystery which lies over the eternal begetting. But this does not entitle us to assume that he had no awareness of it. Johannine preaching and doctrine is designed to awaken faith, 20:30 f., not to give full and systematic knowledge. Hence it does not have to dispel all mysteries."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniqueness===
This issue overlaps with, and is interrelated with, the question of begetting above. Interpretation of the uniqueness of ''monogenes'' in New Testament usage partly depends on understanding of Hellenistic Jewish ideas about inheritance. [[Philo]] stated: 
*On Abraham 194: "In the second place, after he [Abraham] had become the father of this [Isaac] his loved-and-only (''agapetos kai monos'') son, he, from the moment of his birth, cherished towards him all the genuine feelings of affection, which exceeds all modest love, and all the ties of friendship which have ever been celebrated in the world." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldchristianwritings.com/writings/yonge/book22.html Philo On Abraham] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306024534/http://www.oldchristianwritings.com/writings/yonge/book22.html |date=2012-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On Sacrifice X.(43): "And he [Jacob] learnt all these things from Abraham his grandfather, who was the author of his own education, who gave to the all-wise Isaac all that he had, leaving none of his substance to bastards, or to the spurious reasonings of concubines, but he gives them small gifts, as being inconsiderable persons. For the possessions of which he is possessed, namely, the perfect virtues, belong only to the perfect and legitimate son;"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldchristianwritings.com/writings/yonge/book6.html Philo On Sacrifice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306024616/http://www.oldchristianwritings.com/writings/yonge/book6.html |date=2012-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1894 translation of Philo [[Charles Duke Yonge]] rendered "loved-and-only son" (''agapetos kai monos uios'') as "only legitimate son", which is not unreasonable given Philo's parallel comments in On Sacrifice X.43. It also parallels [[Josephus]]' use (see above 20:20) for a legitimate son of the main royal wife.

Likewise in the later Jewish Septuagint revisions:
* Gen 22:2 of Aquila "take your son Isaac, your only-begotten (''monogenes'') son whom you love"
* Gen 22:12 of Symmachus "now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only-begotten (''monogenes'') son, from me.”

In contrast in Proverbs 4:3 Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion all have ''monogenes'' of a mother's only-begotten son where legitimacy is not an issue.

===Textual issues in John 1:18===
In [[textual criticism]] opinions are divided on whether Jesus is referred to as "only-begotten God" or "only-begotten Son", in John 1:18.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E Brown Introduction to the New Testament Christology 1994 Page 179&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''monogenes theos'' [[Sinaiticus]], [[Papyrus 66|P66]], [[Codex Vaticanus|Vaticanus]] etc.
* ''o monogenes uios'' [[Alexandrinus]], [[Textus Receptus]], [[Peshitta]] etc.:
This textual issue is complicated by the scribal abbreviations of [[nomina sacra]] where "G-d" and "S-n" are abbreviated in the Greek manuscripts by ΘΣ and ΥΣ ([[theta]]-[[sigma]] vs [[upsilon]]-[[sigma]]) increasing the likelihood of scribal error.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Wikgren]] footnote in Metzger ''A Textual Commentary on The Greek New Testament'' United Bible Societies 2nd ed. p. 170."It is doubtful that the author would have written ''monogenes theos'' which may be a primitive transcriptional error in the Alexandrian tradition ΘϹ/ΥΣ. At least a 'D' decision would be preferable. A.W."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Monster Rancher''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Monster Farm'''''|モンスターファーム|Monsutā Fāmu}}, is a console game released in [[North America]] on November 30, 1997, for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] system. It is the first game in Tecmo's ''[[Monster Rancher]]'' series, featuring the raising, fighting, and breeding of [[Digital pet|monsters]].

==Gameplay==
Although it is possible to acquire a monster in-game, the series is known for the ability to acquire new monsters using [[Compact Disc]]s (CDs). Players can use any readable CD, and the game creates a monster using the CD's metadata. Certain CDs would result in unique monsters: for example, some [[Christmas]] music albums will give the player a monster of type "[[Santa Claus|Santa]]". Once the player has two or more monsters in reserve, they can be combined, creating a new monster with traits of both 'parents.'

Once the player has a monster, it can then be raised to be a fighting machine. There are six stats that determine how the monster does in battle: Power fuels physical attacks, Intelligence fuels and defends against energy attacks, Life determines monster's [[hit points]], Skill affects accuracy, Speed helps evade opponents' attacks, and Defense reduces damage received from physical attacks. Monsters train either by doing chores nearby, or can be sent to be trained by experts, where they have the chance to gain new attack techniques. It is possible to increase some of the monster's stats with food or vitamins, but vitamins comes at a price of decreasing one stat as well as shorting the life span dramatically. 

Currency can be used to purchase items in the game, earned by winning monster fighting tournaments. The game can end if the player runs out of currency to manage the monster.
 
The primary way to advance through the game is through monster fighting tournaments. While in battle, each monster has attacks available to it, some moves are only available at close range, others from a distance. Players cannot control the monster directly in a fight, but can call for their monster to stay away or close in, and attack with whichever move is available at the current range.

In ''[[Monster Rancher 2]]'' and ''[[Monster Rancher Advance 2]]'', Holly, the assistant from this game, cameos as a rancher from the group, AGIMA, for whom the player trains monsters.

'''Mrs Chippy''' was a [[cat]] (actually male) who accompanied Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] of 1914–1917.

== Life ==
Mrs Chippy, a tiger-striped [[tabby cat|tabby]], was taken on board the expedition's ship ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'' as a [[ship's cat]] by carpenter and master shipwright [[Harry McNish | Harry "Chippy" McNish]] ("Chippy" being a colloquial British term for a carpenter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Partridge |first=Eric |editor-last=Beale |editor-first=Paul |title=A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English | year = 2002 | edition = 8 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 978-0-415-29189-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cat acquired its name because, once aboard, it followed McNish around like an overly-attentive wife.

One month after the ship set sail for [[Antarctica]] it was discovered that, despite ''her'' name, Mrs Chippy was actually a male. By that time, however, the name had stuck. He was described as "full of character" by members of the expedition and impressed the crew with his ability to walk along the ship's inch-wide [[Guard rail|rail]]s in even the roughest seas. In Captain [[Frank Worsley]]’s diary he describes Mrs Chippy climbing the rigging "…    exactly after the manner of a seaman going aloft".
  
[[File:Harry McNeish Gravestone cat.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze sculpture of Mrs Chippy on the grave of [[Harry McNish]] in Karori Cemetery which was added by the New Zealand Antarctic Society]]
Mrs Chippy’s voyage was not without incident. Storekeeper [[Thomas Orde-Lees]], in a diary entry dated 13 September 1914, relates that "An extraordinary thing happened during the night. The tabby cat jumped overboard through one of the cabin portholes and the officer on watch, Lt. [[Hubert Hudson|Hudson]], heard her screams and turned the ship smartly round &amp; picked her up. She must have been in the water 10 minutes or more". The cat was retrieved by the ship’s biologist, [[Robert Clark (zoologist) | Robert Clark]], using one of his sample nets.

After the ship became trapped in pack ice and was destroyed, Shackleton decided that Mrs Chippy, and five of the sled dogs that had been carried on board, would not survive. In a diary entry dated 29 October 1915 he recorded:

{{quote|This afternoon Sallie's three youngest pups, Sue's Sirius, and Mrs. Chippy, the carpenter's cat, have to be shot. We could not undertake the maintenance of weaklings under the new conditions. [[Alexander Macklin|Macklin]], [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Crean]], and the carpenter seemed to feel the loss of their friends rather badly.&lt;ref name="isbn0-451-19880-8"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shackleton |first=Ernest |author-link=Ernest Shackleton |title=South |date=1919 |publisher=Signet |location=New York |isbn=0-451-19880-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

McNish was very attached to Mrs Chippy and never forgave Shackleton for having him killed. He died, destitute, in Wellington, New Zealand, in September 1930, and was buried with full naval honours in an unmarked grave. The New Zealand Antarctic Society placed a headstone on the grave in 1959. To this they added a life-size bronze statue of Mrs Chippy in 2004, funded through public subscription, to complete a tribute and memorial to the carpenter and his much loved cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3818613.stm|author=Kim Griggs|publisher=BBC|title=Antarctic hero 'reunited' with cat|date=21 June 2004|accessdate=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
In February 2011 Mrs Chippy was featured on a postage stamp issued by the [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgisland.gs/index.php/%28h%29South_Georgia_Newsletter,_February_2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215232751/http://www.sgisland.gs/index.php/%28h%29South_Georgia_Newsletter,_February_2011|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-12-15|title=South Georgia Newsletter, February 2011|date=February 2011|website=South Georgia &amp; South Sandwich Islands|publisher=GSGSSI|access-date=15 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Stamp - Perce Blackborow &amp; Mrs Chippy.jpg|thumb|South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands Stamp – Perce Blackborow and Mrs Chippy]]

== Cultural references ==
A novel by [[Caroline Alexander (author) | Caroline Alexander]], ''Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition : The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Bound Cat'', was published by [[Bloomsbury Publishing | Bloomsbury]] in 1997. The book provides an account of Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]], covering the period 15 January 1914 to 29 October 1915, in the form of a journal written from a cat’s point of view, supposedly by Mrs Chippy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Caroline |last=Alexander |title=Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition : The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Bound Cat |date=1997 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=0-7475-3527-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final entry recounts Shackleton instructing his crew, now camped on the ice pack following the destruction of their ship, that to ensure their survival "Anything that cannot pull its weight or is not useful to the Expedition must be put down". The book ends poignantly with Mrs Chippy (clearly unaware of the implications of Shackleton's order) relaxing in a tent, reminiscing over past adventures and, after being given a treat of a bowl of sardines, looking forward to assisting with the rest of the expedition.

Mrs Chippy was portrayed in the 2002 [[Channel 4]] mini-series ''[[Shackleton (TV serial) | Shackleton]]'', starring Kenneth Branagh, with the credits stating that the part was played by 'Mac'.

The painting ''Mrs Chippy'' by [[Wolf Howard]] shows the cat "about to be shot", while in the background ''Endurance'' is depicted trapped in the ice and its crew can be seen launching a small open boat on a rescue mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = frank milner| title = the stuckists: punk Victorian| date = November 2004| isbn = 1-902700-27-9| page = 80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was shown in ''[[The Stuckists Punk Victorian]]'' exhibition at the [[Walker Art Gallery]] during the 2004 [[Liverpool Biennial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/stuckists/wolfhoward.aspx "'Mrs Chippy', Wolf Howard"], [[National Museums Liverpool]].

'''Oak Investment Partners''' is a [[private equity]] firm focusing on [[venture capital]] investments in companies developing communications systems, [[information technology]], new [[Internet]] media, healthcare services and retail.

==History==
The firm, founded in 1978, is based in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]] with offices in Norwalk, Connecticut, [[Minneapolis]] and [[Palo Alto]], California. Since inception, Oak had invested in more than 480 companies and had raised more than  $8.4 billion in investor commitments across 12 private equity funds.&lt;ref&gt;Mass High Tech: The Journal of New England Technology, July 21, 2006 ''[http://www.bizjournals.com/masshightech/stories/2006/07/24/story8.html Oak's $2.5B fund, closed in Q2, is nation's largest]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, Oak raised its 12th fund, at $2.56 billion reportedly the largest venture capital fund ever raised.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, July 17, 2006 ''[http://www.thomson.com/content/pr/tf/tf_priv_equiconsul/2006_07_17_2Q06_Mega_Funds_Drive Mega Funds Drive Private Equity Fundraising To New Heights In Second Quarter Of 2006]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Indian-born employee Iftikar Ahmed was sued by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] on suspicion of stealing US$65 million from the firm.&lt;ref name="wsjimmigrant"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harvard, Goldman Sachs, Venture Capital…Fugitive |first1=Anupreeta|last1=Das|first2=Jean|last2=Eaglesham |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/harvard-goldman-sachs-venture-capitalfugitive-1444261176 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=October 7, 2015 |accessdate = October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed was believed to have fled to India.  In August 2015, Fortune reported that Mr. Ahmed had been detained in an Indian prison from May 22 until July 23 and that his passport had been confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;http://fortune.com/2015/08/07/ifty-ahmed-vc-charged-with-fraud-spent-past-two-months-in-india-jail/&lt;/ref&gt;

Oak also selectively invests in public companies through [[private investment in public equity|PIPE]] investments.

In December 2008, Oak invested $25 million in the online media outlet [[Huffington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://kara.allthingsd.com/20081201/huffington-post-nabs-25-million-in-funding-heres-an-exclusive-boomtown-interview-with-oak-investments-fred-harman/ Huffington Post Nabs $25 Million in Funding–Here’s a BoomTown Interview With Oak Investment’s Fred Harman]'' All Things Digital, December 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Capitan Ramon Arnaud.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Capt. Ramón Arnaud Vignon]]

Captain '''Ramón Arnaud Vignon''' (1877–1915) was an officer in the [[Mexican Army]] and the last Mexican governor of [[Clipperton Island]].

== Early years and military enlistment==

Ramón Arnaud was born in [[Orizaba]], [[Veracruz]], in 1879, to Ángel Arnaud and Carlota Vignon, Mexicans of French origin who had settled in Veracruz in the aftermath of the 1862–1867 [[French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention]]. He completed his primary education in Orizaba and, influenced by a friend of his, the son of General [[Bernardo Reyes]], decided to enlist in the [[Military of Mexico|Army]]. He was unable to secure entry to the [[Colegio Militar|Military Academy]] in Mexico City but, assisted by the influence of General Reyes, enrolled as a sergeant in the 7th Cavalry Regiment. Shortly after enlisting, however, he deserted; he was promptly tracked down, arrested, sent to the military prison in [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] for 5½ months, and demoted to a private in the 23rd Infantry Battalion. In the space of three years, however, he had regained his earlier rank after fighting against [[Maya people|Maya]] insurgents in the [[Caste War of Yucatán]]. Shortly after that, he was posted to [[Japan]] in the company of Col. [[Abelardo Ávalos]].

== Governor of Clipperton ==

Upon his return from the East Asia, the government of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Porfirio Díaz]] placed him in charge of the military garrison on [[Clipperton Island]], an atoll in the Pacific subject to a sovereignty dispute between Mexico and France. At first he was reluctant, believing that this amounted to an exile from Mexico, but Col. Ávalos convinced him by telling him that President Díaz had personally chosen him to protect Mexico's interests in the international conflict with France, and that the fact that he spoke English, French, and Spanish would assist him in protecting Mexico's sovereignty over the territory. He consequently accepted and arrived on Clipperton as governor in 1906. 

By 1914, the situation on the island had turned difficult. With the outbreak of the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the overthrow of [[Victoriano Huerta]], the Mexican supply ship that sailed between Clipperton and [[Acapulco]] had stopped coming. An American ship arrived, bringing provisions and rescuing a German, Gustav Schultz (the representative of the company which mined guano on Clipperton Island), who had lost his mind.  The Americans also impressed upon Arnaud the seriousness of the problems which confronted Mexico (including the [[United States Occupation of Veracruz|American occupation of Veracruz]]) and informed him of the outbreak of the [[First World War]], advising him to abandon the island. Nevertheless, the captain and the rest of the soldiers decided to remain, staying faithful to their duty even though their homeland had forgotten them.

== Final days ==

In 1915, an outbreak of scurvy claimed many of the colonists' lives and in 1915, by now desperate  and at the head of a colony that had no food, Arnaud set sail with three soldiers in a canoe in pursuit of a passing ship they had spied. They were unable to reach the ship, however, and the canoe sank while returning, drowning all four of its occupants.

'''Ruth Leger Sivard''' (November 25, 1915 – August 21, 2015) was an American economist. She worked at the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]] from 1961 to 1971, drawing attention to excessive military budgets by compiling data on international defense spending.

==Early life and education==
Ruth Lucille Leger was born in [[Elmhurst, Queens]], to George and Susan (née Zieten) Leger on November 25, 1915. She attended [[Flushing High School]], then earned a sociology degree from [[Smith College]] in 1937. Sivard obtained a master's degree in economics at [[New York University]].&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Sam|title=Ruth Sivard, Economist Who Scrutinized Military Spending, Dies at 99|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/ruth-sivard-economist-who-scrutinized-military-spending-dies-at-99.html|accessdate=August 30, 2015|work=New York Times|date=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Sivard worked with several federal agencies and non-governmental organizations before joining the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]] (ACDA) in 1961. She became the leader of ACDA's economic department three years later and began comparing military budgets to social statistics and other budgets in annual reports, including information on social indicators like [[infant mortality]]. [[Melvin Laird]], Secretary of Defense, derided the reports as "misleading" and the agency was ordered by the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration to cease publishing the analyses in 1970.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

Sivard left ACDA in 1971, and founded her own non-profit group, World Priorities. The organization, backed by the [[Carnegie Corporation]], [[Ford Foundation]], and [[Rockefeller Foundation]], among others, published sixteen editions of ''World Military and Social Expenditures'' from 1974 to 1996.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=WPobit/&gt; The government published its own annual report, ''World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers'', which did not make the comparison to social spending. Sivard reported in 1986 that the White House was one of the best customers for her report.&lt;ref name=nytgame&gt;{{cite news|title=Two, it seems, can play the numbers game|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/18/us/two-it-seems-can-play-the-numbers-game.html|work=New York Times|date=January 18, 1986|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This set of work continued to focus on the steady increase in defense spending in spite of other, more serious problems also needing attention, such as worldwide poverty, famine, illiteracy, and unemployment.&lt;ref name=WPobit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Langer|first1=Emily|title=Ruth Leger Sivard, economist who measured the cost of militarism, dies at 99|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/ruth-leger-sivard-economist-who-measured-the-cost-of-militarism-dies-at-99/2015/08/29/7f46538a-4e59-11e5-84df-923b3ef1a64b_story.html|accessdate=August 30, 2015|work=Washington Post|date=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
She was married to high school classmate Robert Sivard (1914–1990),&lt;ref name=robsivardnytobit&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert Sivard, 75, Former Art Director For the Government|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/06/obituaries/robert-sivard-75-former-art-director-for-the-government.html|accessdate=August 30, 2015|work=New York Times|date=January 6, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; the former art director of the [[United States Information Agency]], with whom she had two children.

'''Steven Lang''' (sometimes spelled '''Stephen Lang''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a manufacturer of the mutant-hunting robots called [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]]. He first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' #96.

==Fictional character biography==
Dr. Steven Lang is a pioneer in the field of robotics and genetic mutation who hates mutants. An employee of the U.S. government, he is placed in charge of a federal investigation into the origin of genetic mutation. He plans to use his talents to create an army of mutant hunting robots to kill all mutants. To this end he seeks to get the government to endorse and financially support his operations. Lang begins by targeting mutant criminals such as [[Mesmero]].{{issue|date=March 2013}} He is backed by [[Edward Buckman|Ned Buckman]] and the "Council of the Chosen,"{{issue|date=March 2013}} the secret group in control of the New York Branch of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] prior to [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]'s takeover.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

To defeat his main targets, the X-Men, Lang creates the "X-Sentinels," [[android (robot)|android]] doubles of [[Professor X]] and the original X-Men. However, the X-Sentinels manage only inferior imitations of the X-Men's powers, and are easily defeated by the new X-Men. Jean Grey then telekinetically forces Lang to crash his mini-gunship into a wall-screen.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' #100 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; He is left in a coma with severe brain damage.{{issue|date=March 2013}} During this time, Lang's brain is used as a template for the minds of two sentinels, Conscience and a new [[Master Mold]], both of whom are destroyed in an attempt to release a virus which would have killed all mutants and roughly 97% of normal humans on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Comics Presents'' #17-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Lang returns as a member of the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], a group of humans who had been transformed into techno-organic human-alien hybrids.  The transformation process restores Lang's mind, and he becomes their leader.{{issue|date=March 2013}}  Lang is the only one of the Phalanx to retain his individual human identity, possibly due to the brain damage; when his true nature is revealed, he was dragged to his apparent death by his lieutenant, [[Cameron Hodge]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Lang's corpse is exhumed by the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] and reanimated by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] using a Technarch. He joins a group formed by the foremost anti-mutant leaders under Bastion's control.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' vol. 3 #3 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; During the ''[[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]]'' storyline, Steven Lang, alongside [[Graydon Creed]], is killed by [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' vol. 3 #28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
As a normal human being Stephen Lang had no superhuman powers.  However, he was a genius and pioneer in the field of robotics, with adequate financial resources to fund his operations. 

As a member of the Phalanx he had all of the characteristics of a techno-organic life form: enhanced strength, durability, and agility, ability to re-shape corporeal form at will, and to infect other beings with the [[techno-organic virus]] and control infected beings.

'''Telly Monster''', known usually as just '''Telly''', is an eternally [[worry]]ing, [[fuchsia]] monster [[The Muppets|Muppet]] on ''[[Sesame Street]]''. He is puppeteered by [[Martin P. Robinson]].

==First appearance==
[[File:Tellyplaystuba.jpg|thumb|right|Telly plays tuba]]

On his debut in 1979, he was known as the "Television Monster", a character that was fixated on [[television]]. His name is derived from the [[British slang]] term for a television, "telly". Initially the character had [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] standing out of the top of his head, and his eyes would whirl around when he watched television. 

In Telly's first ''Sesame Street'' appearance, when he was performed by Bob Payne, a T.V. obsessed Telly, enters Hooper's store, where he nervously asks [[Mr. Hooper]] to plug in the T.V. using his outlet. Suddenly, Telly runs out of the store, leaving Mr. Hooper nervous. David then enters the store, and Mr. Hooper tells him about how he let Telly use his outlet. Mr. Hooper and David together, decide to follow the orange cord outside where they find a disturbed Telly occupied by his T.V. However, when Telly simply replies "I'm glued", David comes up with the idea to ask him if he was moving into the neighborhood. Telly tells David that he had already moved in, and also when Mr. Hooper asks Telly if he was going to live right on the street, Telly said that he was right with his T.V. set not needing anything else. Mr. Hooper, Telly and David finally decide to settle things by getting to know each other, and after introducing himself, Telly turns around from his set looking at David and Mr. Hooper with his whirly, red eyes. Afterwards, both Mr. Hooper and David become puzzled with Telly's strange name.

After Telly Monster’s stint through season eleven, producers worried that the character would be a negative influence on their easily influenced viewers, and changed him into the worry-wart character that he has been ever since.

==Development==
Telly Monster’s first appearance on ''Sesame Street'', after the “Television Monster” season, was with guest star [[Itzhak Perlman]] playing the [[violin]], while Telly played the [[tuba]].

Telly is a [[triangle]] lover, and he has a pet hamster, Chuckie Sue. He has been known to [[pogo stick]] uncontrollably around Sesame Street, often causing havoc with all that gets in his way. This segment is shown on ''[[Sesame Street Unpaved]]''. [[Baby Bear (Sesame Street)|Baby Bear]] is his best friend and appears occasionally in many of the main plots in the later series. Telly also has something of a friendship with [[Oscar the Grouch]], since they appear in many segments together.

Personality-wise, Telly is a fidgeting, nervous wreck, prone easily to [[mania|manic]] behavior and [[paranoia]].

In contrast to [[Kermit the Frog]] as a news reporter for the ''[[Sesame Street News Flash]]'', Telly also has been a roving reporter for his own segment, called ''Monster on the Spot''.


In the 1998 special ''[[Elmopalooza]]'', after [[Jon Stewart]], [[Prairie Dawn]] and the crew are stuck in the dressing room, Telly reacts that if they can't get out, there is no show, which makes the people sad and not go to work tomorrow, which also leads to the economy collapsing, making the [[United States]] being doomed.

{{Atheism sidebar |arguments}}

'''Theological noncognitivism''' is the position that [[Religion|religious]] language –&amp;nbsp;specifically, words such as "[[God]]"&amp;nbsp;– are not [[Cognition|cognitive]]ly [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]ful. It is sometimes considered synonymous with [[ignosticism]].

==Overview==
Theological noncognitivists argue in different ways, depending on what one considers the "[[meaning (philosophy of language)|theory of meaning]]" to be.

One argument holds to the claim that definitions of God are [[wikt:irreducible|irreducible]], self-instituting [[wikt:relational|relational]],  [[wikt:circular|circular]]. For example, a sentence stating that "God is He who created everything, apart from Himself", is seen as circular rather than an [[irreducibility|irreducible]] truth.

[[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] writing from a [[verificationist]] perspective concludes that religious language is meaningless because it is not verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Martin, Michael]]. ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification''. [[Temple University Press]], 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-87722-642-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Michael. "[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/michael_martin/meaningless.html Positive Atheism and The Meaninglessness of Theism]", [[Infidels.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George H. Smith]] uses an attribute-based approach in an attempt to prove that there is no [[concept]] for God: he argues that there are no meaningful attributes, only negatively defined or [[wikt:relational|relational]] attributes, making the term meaningless.

An example: Consider the proposition of the existence of a "pink unicorn". When asserting the proposition, one can use attributes to at least describe the concept such a cohesive idea is transferred in language. With no knowledge of "pink unicorn", it can be described minimally with the attributes "pink", "horse", and "horn". Only then can the proposition be accepted or rejected. The acceptance or rejection of the proposition is distinct from the concept.

It is asserted by Steven J. Conifer that to be a [[Negative and positive atheism|positive atheist]], one who not only lacks a belief in gods but who furthermore denies that gods exist, is to give credence to the existence of a concept of something for God to refer to, because it assumes that there is something understandable to ''not'' believe in.&lt;ref&gt;Conifer, Steven J.

'''Therianthropy''' is the [[mythology|mythological]] ability of human beings to [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into other animals by means of [[shapeshifting]]. It is possible that cave drawings found at [[Trois Frères|Les Trois Frères]], in France, depict ancient beliefs in the concept. The most well known form of therianthropy is found in stories concerning [[Werewolf|werewolves]].

== Etymology ==
The term "therianthropy" comes from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] ''theríon'' [θηρίον], meaning "wild animal" or "beast" (implicitly mammalian); and ''anthrōpos'' [ἄνθρωπος], meaning "human being". It was used to refer to animal transformation folklore of Europe as early as 1901.&lt;ref name="De Groot 171"&gt;{{cite book | last= De Groot| first= J.J.M.| year=1901| title=The Religious System of China: Volume IV| location= Leiden| publisher= Brill| page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the term "[[zoanthropy]]" is used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Guiley| first= R.E.| year=2005| title=The Encyclopedia of Vampires, Werewolves &amp; Other Monsters| location= New York| publisher= Facts on File| isbn= 0-8160-4685-9| page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therianthropy was used to describe spiritual beliefs in animal transformation in a 1915 Japanese publication, "A History of the Japanese People from the Earliest Times to the End of the Meiji Era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnsEAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=therianthropy&amp;dq=therianthropy| title=A History of the Japanese People from the Earliest Times to the End of the Meiji Era| first=Frank| last= Brinkley|author2=Dairoku Kikuchi | year=1915| publisher=The Encyclopædia Britannica Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source, "The Human Predator", raises the possibility the term may have been used as early as the 16th century in criminal trials of suspected werewolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Human Predator: A Historical Chronicle of Serial Murder and Forensic Investigation| first=Katherine| last=Ramsland| publisher= Berkley Hardcover| year= 2005| isbn= 0-425-20765-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of therianthropy and theriocephaly==
Therianthropy refers to the fantastical, or mythological, ability of some humans to change into animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Aberrations: A Psychiatric Handbook | author = Edward Podolsky | publisher = Philosophical Library | year = 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therianthropes are said to change forms via shapeshifting. Therianthropy has long existed in [[mythology]], and seems to be depicted in ancient cave drawings&lt;ref name=BritannicaOnline&gt;{{cite web | work=Encyclopædia Britannica| title=Trois Freres| accessdate=2006-12-06| url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9073471/Trois-Freres}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[The Sorcerer (cave art)|''The Sorcerer'']], a [[pictograph]] executed at the Palaeolithic cave drawings found in the [[Pyrénées]] at the [[Trois Frères|Les Trois Frères]], France, archeological site.

'Theriocephaly' (Gr. "animal headedness") refers to beings which have an animal head attached to an anthropomorphic, or human, body; for example, the animal-headed forms of gods depicted in [[ancient Egyptian religion]] (such as [[Ra]], [[Sobek]], [[Anubis]]).

==Mythology of human shapeshifting==
{{Main|Shapeshifting}}

[[File:Vasnetsov Frog Princess.jpg|thumb|left|A frog changes into a princess in the painting ''[[The Frog Princess|Tsarevna Frog]]'' ("The Frog Princess") by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].]]
''Shapeshifting'' in [[folklore]], mythology and [[anthropology]] generally refers to the alteration of physical appearance from that of a human to that of another species.  '''[[Werewolf|Lycanthropy]]''', the transformation of a human into a [[wolf]] (or ''werewolf''), is probably the best known form of therianthropy, followed by '''[[cynanthropy]]''' (transformation into a dog) and ''[[Werecat|ailuranthropy]]'' (transformation into a cat).&lt;ref name="Greene 229"&gt;{{cite book | last=Greene| first= R.| year=2000| title=The Magic of Shapeshifting| location=York Beach, ME| publisher=Weiser| isbn= 1-57863-171-8| page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Werehyena]]s are present in the stories of several [[African culture|African]] and [[Eurasia]]n cultures. Ancient [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] legends from Asia talk of form-changing [[Shamanism|shamans]] known as ''kurtadams'', which translates to "wolfman".{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Ancient Greeks wrote of ''kynanthropy'', from κύων ''kyōn''&lt;ref&gt;[http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/efts/dicos/woodhouse_test.pl?keyword=^Dog,%20subs. ''kynanthropy'']; Woodhouse's English-Greek Dictionary; (1910)&lt;/ref&gt; (or "dog"), which applied to mythological beings able to alternate between dog form and human form, or who possessed combined dog and human anatomical features.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The term existed by at least 1901, when it was applied to stories from China about humans turning into dogs, dogs becoming people, and sexual relations between humans and canines.&lt;ref name="De Groot 184"&gt;{{cite book | last= De Groot| first= J.J.M.| year=1901| title=The Religious System of China: Volume IV| location= Leiden| publisher= Brill| page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist David Gordon White called Central Asia the "vortex of cynanthropy" because races of dog-men were habitually placed there by ancient writers. The weredog or cynanthrope is also known in [[Timor]]. It is described as a human-canine shapeshifter who is capable of transforming other people into animals, even against their will.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

European folklore features [[werecat]]s, who can transform into panthers or domestic cats of an enlarged size.&lt;ref name="giantwerecat"&gt;{{cite book | last = Greene | first = Rosalyn | title = The Magic of Shapeshifting | publisher = [[Red Wheel Weiser Conari|Weiser]] | year = 2000 | page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; African legends describe people who turn into [[lion]]s or [[leopard]]s, while Asian werecats are typically depicted as becoming [[tiger]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Skin-walkers and naguals===
{{Main|Skin-walker|Nagual}}

Some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American and First Nation]] legends talk about skin-walkers—people with the supernatural ability to turn into any animal they desire. To do so, however, they first must be wearing a pelt of the specific animal. In the folk religion of [[Mesoamerica]], a ''nagual'' (or ''nahual'') is a human being who has the power to magically turn themselves into animal forms—most commonly donkeys, turkeys, and dogs—but can also transform into more powerful jaguars and pumas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Animal ancestors===
[[File:Ler swans Millar.jpg|right|thumb|upright|In the Irish [[Mythological Cycle]], the [[Children of Lir]] could transform into swans.]]

Stories of humans descending from animals are found in the oral traditions for many tribal and clan origins. Sometimes the original animals had assumed human form in order to ensure their descendants retained their human shapes; other times the [[origin story]] is of a human marrying a normal animal.

North American [[Native American mythology|indigenous traditions]] mingle the ideas of [[bear]] ancestors and ursine shapeshifters, with bears often being able to shed their skins to assume human form, marrying human women in this guise. The offspring may be creatures with combined anatomy, they may be very beautiful children with uncanny strength, or they may be shapeshifters themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Pijoan| first= T.| year=1992| title=White Wolf Woman &amp; Other Native American Transformation Myths| location= Little Rock| publisher= August House| isbn= 0-87483-200-4| page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P'an Hu is represented in various [[Chinese mythology|Chinese legends]] as a [[supernatural]] dog, a dog-headed man, or a canine shapeshifter that married an emperor's daughter and founded at least one race. When he is depicted as a shapeshifter, all of him can become human except for his head. The race(s) descended from P'an Hu were often characterized by Chinese writers as monsters who combined human and dog anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=White| first= D.G.| year=1991| title=Myths of the Dog-Man| location= Chicago| publisher=The University of Chicago Press| isbn= 0-226-89509-2| page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Turkic mythology]], the wolf is a revered animal. The Turkic legends say the people were descendants of wolves. The legend of [[Asena]] is an old Turkic myth that tells of how the Turkic people were created. In the legend, a small Turkic village in northern China is raided by Chinese soldiers, with one baby left behind. An old she-wolf with a sky-blue mane named Asena finds the baby and nurses him.  She later gives birth to half-wolf, half-human cubs who are the ancestors of the Turkic people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byegm.gov.tr/yayinlarimiz/kitaplar/turkiye2003/content/english/434-435.htm Cultural Life – Literature] Turkey Interactive CD-ROM; 2007-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.C. Kultur Bakanligi; [http://www.discoverturkey.com/english/kultursanat/h-nevruz.html Nevruz Celebrations in Turkey and Central Asia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404172049/http://www.discoverturkey.com/english/kultursanat/h-nevruz.html |date=2007-04-04 }}; Ministry of Culture, Republic of Turkey; accessed 2007-08-11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shamanism===
Ethnologist Ivar Lissner theorised that cave paintings of beings with human and non-human animal features were not physical representations of mythical shapeshifters, but were instead attempts to depict [[Shamanism|shamans]] in the process of acquiring the mental and spiritual attributes of various beasts.&lt;ref name="Steiger 1999"&gt;{{cite book | last=Steiger| first= B.| year=1999| title=The Werewolf Book: The Encyclopedia of Shape-Shifting Beings| location=Farmington Hills, MI| publisher=Visible Ink| isbn=1-57859-078-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious historian [[Mircea Eliade]] has observed that beliefs regarding animal identity and transformation into animals are widespread.&lt;ref name=Eliade&gt;{{cite book | last=Eliade | first=Mircea | title=Rites and Symbols of Initiation: the mysteries of birth and rebirth | publisher=Harper &amp; Row | year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal spirits ===
[[File:Thekelpie large.jpg|thumb|A water spirit takes on a human form in ''[[Kelpie|The Kelpie]]'', a painting by [[Herbert James Draper]].]]
In [[Melanesia]] there is a belief in the ''tamaniu'' or ''atai'', which is an animal counterpart to a person. It may be an eel, a shark, a lizard, or some other creature. This creature is corporeal, can understand human speech, and shares the same soul as its master, leading to legends which have many characteristics typical of shapeshifter tales, such as any death or injury affecting both forms at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hamel| first= F.| year= 1969| title=Human Animals, Werewolves &amp; Other Transformations| location= New Hyde Park, NY| publisher= University Books| isbn= 0-8216-0092-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychiatric aspects ==
Among a sampled set of psychiatric patients, the belief of being part animal, or ''[[clinical lycanthropy]]'', is generally associated with severe psychosis, but not always with any specific psychiatric diagnosis or neurological findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keck PE, Pope HG, Hudson JI, McElroy SL, Kulick AR |title=Lycanthropy: alive and well in the twentieth century |journal=Psychol Med |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=113–20 |date=February 1988 |pmid=3363031 |doi=10.1017/S003329170000194X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others regard clinical lycanthropy as a delusion in the sense of the self-identity disorder found in [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] and [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] disorders, or as a symptom of other psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref name="Garlipp"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Lycanthropy—psychopathological and psychodynamical aspects | journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] |date=January 2004 | volume=109 | issue=1 | pages=19–22 | last=Garlipp | first=P |author2=Godecke-Koch T |author3=Dietrich DE |author4=Haltenhof H. | doi=10.1046/j.1600-0447.2003.00243.x | pmid=14674954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Therians''' are individuals who believe or feel that they are non-human animals in a spiritual sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1525/nr.2012.15.3.65| title = We Are Spirits of Another Sort| journal = Nova Religio: the Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions| volume = 15| issue = 3| pages = 65| year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen 104"&gt;{{cite book| last=Cohen| first= D.| year=1996| title=Werewolves| location=New York| publisher= Penguin| isbn= 0-525-65207-8| page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also others who claim to have a psychological or neuro-biological connection—rather than a spiritual one—to their creature of identification. Both often use the term "[[species dysphoria]]" to describe their feelings of disconnect from their human bodies and their underlying desire to live as their stated creature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Field Guide to Otherkin|last=Lupa|first=|publisher=Megalithic Books|year=2007|isbn=190571307X|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The therian and [[Vampire lifestyle|vampire]] subcultures are related to the [[otherkin]] community, and are considered part of it by most otherkin, but are culturally and historically distinct movements of their own, despite some overlap in membership.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== mRNA ==

=== Isoforms ===
There are two known [[isoform]]s of TVP23A, variant one and variant two, with variant one being the more common variant in humans.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Protein ==

=== Structure ===

TVP23A is a member of the pfam superfamily containing the [[domain of unknown function]] 846 (DUF846).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cddsrv.cgi?uid=191380 |title=DUF846}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TVP23A has a predicted molecular weight of 24.1 kilodaltons, an isoelectric point of 6.5, and relatively high amounts of [[tryptophan]] and [[phenylalanine]].&lt;ref name="Biology Workbench"&gt;{{cite web|title=SAPS|url=http://seqtool.sdsc.edu/CGI/BW.cgi#!|website=Biology Workbench|publisher=SDSC}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The secondary structure of TVP23A consists primarily of [[alpha helices]] composing 4 transmembrane domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TMHMM|url=http://seqtool.sdsc.edu/CGI/BW.cgi#!|website=Biology Workbench}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is not much information on the tertiary structure of TVP23A or its homologs.  iTASSER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I-TASSER server for protein structure and function prediction|url=http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/|website=zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used to generate a prediction for the folding pattern of TVP23A, which supports the presence of multiple helix structures.
[[File:TVP23Astructure.jpg|none|thumb|Protein structure of TVP23A as predicted by iTASSER]]

== Expression ==
TVP23A is ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gene: TVP23A|url=http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/ExpressionAtlas?g=ENSG00000166676;r=16:10760919-10818794|website=www.ensembl.org|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of higher expression in the brain tissue of mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GDS3142 / 1435130_at|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/tools/profileGraph.cgi?ID=GDS3142:1435130_at|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promoter for TVP23A is GXP_91266, spanning 1403 base pairs located on the negative strand of chromosome 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ElDorado|url=https://www.genomatix.de/|website=Genomatix.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
The hypothesized function of TVP23A is a transmembrane protein involved in retrograde transport of [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] from early [[endosome]]s into the late Golgi apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inadome|first1=Hironori|last2=Noda|first2=Yoichi|last3=Kamimura|first3=Yurika|last4=Adachi|first4=Hiroyuki|last5=Yoda|first5=Koji|title=Tvp38, Tvp23, Tvp18 and Tvp15: Novel membrane proteins in the Tlg2-containing Golgi/endosome compartments of Saccharomyces cerevisiae|journal=Experimental Cell Research|date=February 2007|volume=313|issue=4|pages=688–697|doi=10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.11.008|pmid=17178117}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVP23A interactions with [[SNARE (protein)|SNARE]] TVI1 were found to be required for retrograde transport.

== Interacting Proteins ==
TVP23A has been found to interact with four different proteins via Yeast [[Two-hybrid screening|two hybrid arrays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IntAct|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/|website=www.ebi.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of these proteins, YIPF1 and YIPF2, are believed to be Golgi transport proteins.

== Homology ==

=== Homologous Domains ===
TVP23A is a DUF846 containing protein, which is homologous throughout TVP-type proteins.  This domain contains the 4 transmembrane domains of TVP23A&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF05832|title=Pfam: Family: DUF846 (PF05832)|website=pfam.xfam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paralogs ===
TVP23A has two paralogs, [[FAM18B1|TVP23B]] and TVP23C.  TVP23B and TVP23C are 96% similar to each other, and both are located on [[Chromosome 17 (human)|chromosome 17]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BLAST: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool|url=https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi|website=blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the locations of these three genes, and their identities to each other, it is probable that ancestral TVP23 underwent [[Gene duplication|duplication]] and [[Translocation (genetics)|translocation]], giving rise to TVP23A on chromosome 16 and TVP23B/C on chromosome 17, which then underwent a second duplication to form TVP23B and TVP23C.

'''USS ''Albany''''', the first [[United States Navy]] ship of that name,&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt; was built in the 1840s for the US Navy. The ship was among the last of the wooden sloops powered by sail and saw extensive service in the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]]. Before and after her combat service, ''Albany'' conducted surveillance and observation missions throughout the Caribbean. In September 1854, during a journey along the coast of [[Venezuela]], ''Albany'' was lost with all hands on 28 or 29 September 1854. Included among the 250 men lost were several sons and grandsons of politically prominent men.

==Description and construction==
''Albany'' was one of a group of eight [[Full-rigged ship|full-rigged]], three-[[mast (sailing)|masted]] wooden [[sloop]]s built in the early 1840s that were the last American sailing sloops to be commissioned.&lt;ref name=Potter&gt;E. B. Potter,''Sea Power: A Naval History.'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=kWA9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT157 Chapter 11: Navies in Transition (Administrative Changes)]. Naval Institute Press, Jun 15, 2014. 9781612517674&lt;/ref&gt; The ship measured {{convert|147|ft|11|in|m|1}} long [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]] and she had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|38|ft|6|in|m|1}}. ''Albany'' had a draft of {{convert|17|ft|9|in|m|1}} and had a tonnage of 1042 [[tons burthen]]. The ship had a crew of 210 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=s2&gt;Paul H. Silverstone. ''The Sailing Navy 1775&amp;ndash;1854'' Routledge, 2006, 0415978726 p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; She could maintain a speed of {{convert|13|kn|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name=Albassoc&gt;''USS Albany Association''. [http://www.ussalbany.org/chart.htm Ship's Characteristics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054623/http://www.ussalbany.org/chart.htm |date=4 March 2016 }}. 10/06/2014. Accessed 5 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Albany'' could mount up to four {{convert|8|in|mm|0|adj=on}} shell guns and eighteen {{convert|32|pdr|kg|lk=on|adj=on}} cannon. By 1853, she was armed with six 8-inch guns and sixteen 32-pounder cannon.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt;

The ship's [[keel]] was [[laid down]] in 1843 at the [[New York Navy Yard]]; she was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 27 June 1846, and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 6 November, with [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Samuel Livingston Breese]] in command.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt; Her construction was accelerated so she would be complete for the impending [[Mexican–American War|war]] with Mexico. Although she could carry 22 guns, ''Albany'' sailed with only 20.&lt;ref name=b21&gt;Thomas Berner, ''The Brooklyn Navy Yard'', Arcadia, 1999, 9780738556956, pp. 21, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history in war with Mexico==
The sloop put to sea for her first cruise on 26 November 1846 and joined the [[Home Squadron]]—then engaged in operations against Mexican forces—on 8 January 1847 at [[Anton Lizardo]]. Soon thereafter, however, she left the Mexican coast for an independent cruise to the vicinity of the [[Azores]]. Upon her return to the east coast of Mexico early in March,  ''Albany'' guarded the transport anchorage at [[Isla Verde, Puerto Rico|Isla Verde]] in preparation for [[General (United States)|General]] [[Winfield Scott]]'s operations against [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]]. During the 9 March amphibious action, ''Albany'' landed the reserve elements under Brigadier General [[David E. Twiggs]]. Because the Mexican leaders chose not to oppose the landings, ''Albany'' saw no combat. Later, on 22 March, the sloop of war sent one of her eight-inch shell guns and its crew ashore to assist in the [[siege of Veracruz]].&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships,'' [http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/a/albany-i.html USS Albany (1)], Published:Fri Jun 12 06:40:54 EDT 2015. Accessed 3 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

After Veracruz surrendered on 29 March, ''Albany'' moved to the next objective—[[Alvarado, Veracruz|Alvarado]]. The Mexican forces, however, had already abandoned that port; and [[Lieutenant]] [[Charles G. Hunter]], commanding {{USS|Scourge|1846|2}}, which arrived first, took possession of the town. ''Albany'' soon headed for another target—[[Tuxpan]]. She and the other ships of the squadron arrived at the mouth of the [[Tuxpan River (Veracruz)|Tuxpan River]] on the morning of 17 April. Capt. Breese—commanding ''Albany''—then formed his landing party of over 1,500 sailors and marines drawn from all ships in the squadron. They embarked in the barges and the six ships chosen to ascend the river and [[Battle of Tuxpan|capture Tuxpan]]. Although ''Albany'' herself did not participate in the action, Breese and his landing party did. From 18–22 April, Breese's force moved up the river, engaged and captured two artillery batteries, destroyed fortifications and military equipment at Tuxpan, and then retired down the river to rejoin the squadron. When the American warships dispersed to various blockade stations along the eastern coast of Mexico, ''Albany'' and {{USS|Reefer|1846|2}} remained off the mouth of the Tuxpan River.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;

During service on the blockade at various other points, ''Albany'' arrived off the mouth of the [[Tabasco River]] by 13 June. As in the Tuxpan operation, members of her crew joined an inland expedition. The movement upriver began late in the first [[dog watch]] on 14 June. In two days, the American force ascended the river, disembarked the landing force, routed the defenders on the approaches to [[Tabasco]], and [[Second Battle of Tabasco|captured the town]]. The Americans remained there until 22 July, when [[yellow fever]] and Mexican troops forced the evacuation of the town.&lt;ref name= DANFS/&gt;

Subsequently, ''Albany'' headed home for repairs. She left the Mexican coast on 11 July and arrived in [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]], on 6 August. From there, she soon moved north to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] where she completed her repairs on 27 September. On 10 October, the sloop of war put to sea to return to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]; she resumed blockade duty along the Mexican coast until March 1848, when she was sent to [[Venezuela]] to protect American citizens there during a highly volatile [[constitutional crisis]].&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;

===Midshipman controversy===

With the  Mexican–American War at an end, ''Albany'' began cruising the Caribbean-West Indies region. That duty lasted until 12 September 1848, when she returned to Norfolk.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;  During the West Indies cruise, however, [[John McIntosh Kell]] and three other passed [[midshipmen]] refused a direct order they considered demeaning: they had been ordered to light a candle to summon the relief attendant, a task generally assigned to a midshipman, not a ''passed'' midshipman.  The commander, Victor M. Randolph, brought them up on charges, of which they were convicted and released from the Navy in November 1849, although all were reinstated a year later.&lt;ref&gt;The Civil War Naval Encyclopedia, Volume 1, ''John McIntosh Kell,'' ABC-CLIO, 2011 9781598843385, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war cruises==

Between 15 November 1848 and the latter part of 1853, the sloop made three more extended deployments in the Caribbean-West Indies area as a unit of the Home Squadron. On 12 December 1853, ''Albany'' set sail from Boston, Massachusetts. In May 1854, the commander had filed a report with the [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[James C. Dobbin]] that the [[main mast]] of ''Albany'' was unseaworthy.&lt;ref name=Haase666&gt;Adelaide Rosalie Haasse, ''Index to United States documents relating to foreign affairs, 1828&amp;ndash;1861, Volume 1,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=918bAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA666 Main Mast Unseaworthy]. Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May, Victor Randolph, the former commander of ''Albany'' and now commanding officer (''[[pro tem]]'') of the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|Naval Yard Warrington]], reported that an appropriate mast had been identified and was ready for ''Albany''.  During the replacement of the main mast, there was also some discussion of the condition of the [[Mast (sailing)|fore mast]]. Apparently both were replaced.&lt;ref name=Haasse21&gt;Haasse, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last cruise===
Initially, Gerry had instructions to sail to San Juan, [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], and Aspinwall (now [[Colón, Panama]]), and ''Albany'' set out on 29 June.  By 11 August, instructions ordered Gerry to pass along the coast and to investigate a suspicious ship lurking near [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]]. Additional instructions, sent separately, told Gerry to continue patrolling the [[Windward Islands]] and [[Grand Turk Island|Grand Turk]].&lt;ref name=Haasse21/&gt;

Inline with its instructions, ''Albany'' arrived in [[Curacao]] on 7 September 1854, from [[La Guaira]], [[Venezuela]]. She stayed in port for two days, and left on the morning of the 9th for [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] in Colombia, in what was then called [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]].  A letter from a Curacao correspondent of 19 September 1854 reported that all the crew were well. The sloop made an imposing appearance moored in the harbor and, upon leaving port, she saluted one of the forts with twenty-one guns, which was answered, and then saluted a Dutch ship, the [[corvette]] ''Palloo'' with eleven guns.&lt;ref name=Veritas&gt;Veritas. "The Dutch West Indies." &lt;u&gt;Weekly Herald&lt;/u&gt; [New York, New York] [Oct. 21, 1854]: 335. 19th Century U.S. Newspapers. Web. 3 Nov. 2015. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 September, Commander Gerry sent a report updating his superiors on the cruise, dispatched from Aspinwall.&lt;ref name=Haase666/&gt; ''Albany'' departed Aspinwall, [[Colombia]] on 28&amp;ndash;29 September 1854, intending to sail to New York. She was never seen again.&lt;ref name= DANFS/&gt;

By the November, reports circulated through coastal cities that there was much "uneasiness felt in Washington in relation to the sloop-of-war ''Albany''," which had not been heard from since 28 September, when she left Aspinwall for New York.&lt;ref&gt;"Multiple News Items." &lt;u&gt;Bangor Daily Whig &amp; Courier&lt;/u&gt; [Bangor, Maine] 13 Nov. 1854: n.p. 19th Century U.S. Newspapers. Web. 3 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; By early December, the steamer [[USS Princeton (1851)|USS ''Princeton'']] had returned from searching for the missing sloop, which had not been seen or heard from on any of the channels frequented by ship traffic of the [[British West Indies]].&lt;ref name=Herald&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Weekly Herald&lt;/u&gt; (New York, New York), Saturday, December 09, 1854; Issue 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  In late December, a report surfaced that the vessel had arrived at Cartagena safely,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Boston Investigator&lt;/u&gt; (Boston, Massachusetts), Wednesday, December 20, 1854; Issue 34.&lt;/ref&gt; but this report was apparently in error, possibly generated by the arrival of the report that Gerry had mailed before leaving Aspinwall at the end of September.&lt;ref name=Haasse21&gt;Haasse, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the Navy's steam ships were searching the area for ''Albany''.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Boston Daily Atlas&lt;/u&gt; (Boston, Massachusetts), Saturday, March 03, 1855; Issue 208.  &lt;u&gt;Daily National Intelligencer&lt;/u&gt; (Washington, District Of Columbia), Monday, March 05, 1855; Issue 13,109.&lt;/ref&gt; The steamer [[USS Fulton (1837)|USS ''Fulton'']] searched from January to May from Cartegena to Aspinwall, the [[Bay of Darien]], into the [[Gulf of Honduras|Bay of Guatemala]], and along the [[Mosquito Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;Haasse, p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1856, after an exhaustive search of 15 months, the ship was given up as lost.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;[[The Daily Cleveland Herald]]&lt;/u&gt; (Cleveland, Ohio), Tuesday, January 08, 1856; Issue 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family compensation===
The Department of the Navy requested an inquiry into the loss, which was passed on to the appropriate Senate Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Pierce, Correspondence with the Senate, ''To the Senate (re sloop-of-war Albany),'' 26 February 1855, Congressional Edition, Volume 745, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mWZHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA331 p. 331].&lt;/ref&gt; A second craft, {{USS|Porpoise|1836|6}}, had been lost in a [[typhoon]] while conducting an exploratory cruise of the [[Bonins]], the [[Wanshan Archipelago|Ladrones]], and the [[Mariana Islands|Mariana]] islands.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships,'' [http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/p/porpoise-ii.html  ''USS Porpoise (1836)''], Mon Aug 24 09:47:26 EDT 2015, Accessed 4 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  By resolution of the Senate, a fund was provided for the widows and orphans of the officers, mariners, and seamen of both ships.  Furthermore, the appropriate wages were paid to the families (including parents, brothers, or sisters) of the men lost, despite the loss of Nixon White (Purser)'s account books.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress, John Cook Rives (ed), United States. Blair and Rives, 1856, p. 809.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Rowland Leach, the ship's carpenter, this amounted to $1559, including $779 for a year's gratuitous pay ordered by the Department of the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;See Probate Records, Rowland Leach (August 1855).

===Partial list of the lost===

As of 30 June 1854, the crew of ''Albany'' consisted of 18 officers, 156 seaman, and 23 Marines. It is likely the ship's complement was little changed when she was lost three months later.&lt;ref name=Herald/&gt; The crew included several sons and grandsons of prominent men: Commander James T. Gerry, youngest son of [[Elbridge Gerry]], formerly [[Vice President of the United States]], Lieutenant John Quincy Adams, grandson of the [[John Adams|second president]] and nephew of the [[John Quincy Adams|sixth]], and Midshipman Bennet Israel Riley, son of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] General [[Bennet C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">'''Voltinism''' is a term used in biology to indicate the number of broods or generations of an organism in a year. The term is most often applied to insects, and is particularly in use in [[sericulture]], where [[silkworm]] varieties vary in their voltinism.

* '''Univoltine''' – (adjective) referring to organisms having one brood or generation per year
* '''Bivoltine''' – (adjective) referring to organisms having two broods or generations per year
* '''Multivoltine''' – (adjective) referring to organisms having more than two broods or generations per year
* '''Semivoltine''' – (adjective) referring to organisms whose [[generation time]] is more than one year

==Examples==
The [[speckled wood butterfly]] is '''univoltine''' in the northern part of its range, e.g. northern Scandinavia. Adults emerge in late spring, mate, and die shortly after laying eggs; their offspring will grow until [[pupation]], enter [[diapause]] in anticipation of the winter, and emerge as adults the following year – thus resulting in a single generation of butterflies per year. In southern Scandinavia, the same species is '''bivoltine'''&lt;ref name="Aalberg" /&gt; – here, the offspring of spring-emerging adults will develop directly into adults during the summer, mate, and die. Their offspring in turn constitute a second generation, which is the generation that will enter winter diapause and emerge as adults (and mate) in the spring of the following year. This results in a pattern of one short-lived generation (c. 2–3 months) that breeds during the summer, and one long-lived generation (ca. 9-10 months) that diapauses through the winter and breeds in the spring. The [[Parnassius smintheus|Rocky Mountain parnassian]] and the [[High brown fritillary]] are more examples of univoltine butterfly species.&lt;ref name="Aalberg"&gt;Aalberg Haugen IM, Berger D, and Gotthard K. 2012.

The bee species ''[[Macrotera portalis]]'' is bivoltine, and is estimated to have about 2 or 3 broods annually. During winter, individuals remain in diapause, in their pharate or prepupal stage. This diapause stage continues until metamorphosis in the next spring or summer, whereupon the bees emerge as adults. &lt;ref name="museum"&gt;Buchmann, Stephen L. [https://desertmuseum.org/books/nhsd_bees.php?print=y “Bees”], ''[[Bees]]'', Retrieved on 15 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amegilla dawsoni|Dawson's burrowing bee]] is an example of a '''univoltine''' insect of the order [[Hymenoptera]]. The brood of one winter will remain dormant underground until the following winter, and then will surface from their burrows to mate once, and establish new nests.  


===Partial voltinism===
The term '''partial voltinism''' is used to refer to two different (but not necessarily exclusive) situations:
* An organism wherein generations overlap in time, and so are not completely reproductively isolated. For example, in bees of the subfamily [[Halictinae]], one generation is produced in the early summer and one in the late summer, but males produced in the early summer may also [[Mating|mate]] in the late summer.&lt;ref name="Seger"&gt;Seger J. 1983. Partial bivoltinism may cause alternating sex-ratio biases that favor eusociality. 4pp. Nature, 301:59-62, Available online: [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v301/n5895/abs/301059a0.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* (More commonly) a population where the voltinism is mixed, because of genetic variation (e.g., in the [[hybrid zone]] between a univoltine and a bivoltine area) and/or because environmental stimuli do not induce bivoltinism in all individuals (or across all years). For example, far-northern populations of the [[green-veined white]] butterfly ''Pieris napi'' are mostly univoltine, but some individuals may avert [[diapause]] and produce an additional generation under warm conditions.&lt;ref name="Kivelä"&gt;Kivelä SM, Svensson B, Tiwe A, and Gotthard K. 2015. Thermal plasticity of growth and development varies adaptively among alternative developmental pathways. 13pp. Evolution, 69:9, Available online: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12734/full]&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of breeding cycles in a year is under genetic control in many species&lt;ref&gt;Coates BS, Sumerford DV, and Hellmich RL. 2004.

Many [[phytophagous]] species that are dependent on seasonal plant resources are univoltine. Some such species have the ability to [[diapause]] for a large part of the year, typically during a cold winter.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M.D. and J.N. McNeil. 1997  Host-plant quality influences diapause and voltinism in a polyphagous insect herbivore. Ecology 78: 977-986.

Yet other species that live in tropical regions with little seasonality may be highly multivoltine, with several generations feeding on constantly growing vegetation (such as some species of [[Saturniidae]]), or continually renewed detritus, such as ''[[Drosophila]]'' and many other genera of flies with a life cycle of just a week or two.&lt;ref name="Schowalter2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Timothy Duane Schowalter |title=Insect Ecology: An Ecosystem Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KzokTLIysQC&amp;pg=PA159 |year=2011 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-381351-0 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. '''Warren Bertram Snyder''' (March 2, 1903 in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] &amp;ndash; March 27, 1957) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] athlete and doctor. Snyder competed for Canada in [[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]] in the [[1924 Summer Olympics]]. Snyder won the silver medal as crew member of the Canadian boat in the eights event. Before he competed in the men’s eights at the 1924 Summer Olympics, Snyder was well known as a basketball, baseball, and rugby football player. As a 17-year old, he helped the [[Toronto Varsity Blues football|University of Toronto Varsity Blues]] defeat the [[Toronto Argonauts]] 16-3 to win the Grey Cup in [[8th Grey Cup|1920]]. At the 1924 Olympics, his Varsity Blues eights squad, which consisted of [[Arthur Bell (rower)|Arthur Bell]], [[Ivor Campbell]], [[Robert Hunter (rower)|Robert Hunter]], [[William Langford (rower)|William Langford]], [[Harold Little]], [[John Smith (Canadian rower)|John Smith]], [[Norman Taylor]], and [[William Wallace (rower)|William Wallace]], lost their heat to the United States, but earned the right to compete in the final by winning the repêchage. There they were again defeated by the United States, but captured the silver medal ahead of the Italians and the Britons.
