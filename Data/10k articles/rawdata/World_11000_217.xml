==Post-election==
[[Günther Oettinger]] stayed on Minister-President, in a CDU-FDP coalition, after a CDU-Green coalition had also been considered (for the first time in this state).

On 27 November 2007 [[Oswald Metzger]], elected in [[Biberach an der Riß|Biberach]], formally ended his membership in the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]], but stayed in the Landtag without a faction until, on 18 February 2008, [[Eugen Schlachter]] (member of [[Alliance '90/The Greens]]) took his seat, thus bringing the Greens faction to 17 seats again. Metzger then joined the CDU.

[[File:Bank Run on American Union Bank.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.5|American Union Bank, New York City. April 26, 1932.]]
 
A '''bank run''' (also known as a '''run on the bank''') occurs when a large number of people withdraw their money from a [[bank]], because they believe the bank may cease to function in the near future. In other words, it is when, in a [[fractional-reserve banking]] system (where banks normally only keep a small proportion of their assets as cash), a large number of customers withdraw cash from [[deposit account]]s with a financial institution at the same time because they believe that the financial institution is, or might become, [[insolvency|insolvent]]; and keep the cash or transfer it into other assets, such as government bonds, [[precious metal]]s or [[gemstone]]s. When they transfer funds to another institution it may be characterised as a [[capital flight]]. As a bank run progresses, it generates its own momentum: as more people withdraw cash, the likelihood of default increases, triggering further withdrawals. This can destabilize the bank to the point where it runs out of cash and thus faces sudden [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref name=Diamond2007/&gt; To combat a bank run, a bank may limit how much cash each customer may withdraw, suspend withdrawals altogether, or promptly acquire more cash from other banks or from the central bank, besides other measures.

A '''banking panic''' or '''bank panic''' is a [[financial crisis]] that occurs when many banks suffer runs at the same time, as people suddenly try to convert their threatened deposits into cash or try to get out of their domestic banking system altogether. A '''systemic banking crisis''' is one where all or almost all of the banking capital in a country is wiped out.&lt;ref name=imf2008/&gt; The resulting chain of bankruptcies can cause a long [[economic recession]] as domestic businesses and consumers are starved of capital as the domestic banking system shuts down.&lt;ref name=Wicker/&gt;  According to former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman [[Ben Bernanke]], the [[Great Depression]] was caused by the [[Federal Reserve System]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke At the Conference to Honor Milton Friedman, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois|date=November 8, 2002|website=Federalreserve.gov|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much of the economic damage was caused directly by bank runs.&lt;ref name=Bernanke/&gt; The cost of cleaning up a systemic banking crisis can be huge, with fiscal costs averaging 13% of [[GDP]] and economic output losses averaging 20% of GDP for important crises from 1970 to 2007.&lt;ref name=imf2008/&gt;

Several techniques have been used to try to prevent bank runs or mitigate their effects. They have included a higher [[reserve requirement]] (requiring banks to keep more of their reserves as cash), government [[bailout]]s of banks, [[bank regulation|supervision and regulation]] of commercial banks, the organization of [[central bank]]s that act as a [[lender of last resort]], the protection of [[deposit insurance]] systems such as the U.S. [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]],&lt;ref name=Diamond2007/&gt; and after a run has started, a temporary suspension of withdrawals.&lt;ref name=Heffernan/&gt; These techniques do not always work: for example, even with deposit insurance, depositors may still be motivated by beliefs they may lack immediate access to deposits during a bank reorganization.&lt;ref name="WaMu-LAT"/&gt;

{{further|List of bank runs|List of banking crises}}

Bank runs first appeared as part of [[credit cycle|cycles of credit expansion]] and its subsequent contraction. In the 16th century onwards, English goldsmiths issuing promissory notes suffered severe failures due to bad harvests, plummeting parts of the country into famine and unrest. Other examples are the Dutch [[Tulip mania]]s (1634–1637), the British [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] (1717–1719), the French [[Mississippi Company]] (1717–1720), the post-Napoleonic depression (1815–1830) and the [[Great Depression]] (1929–1939).

Bank runs have also been used to blackmail individuals or governments. In 1832, for example, the British government under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]] overturned a majority government on the orders of the king, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], to prevent reform (the later [[1832 Reform Act]]). Wellington's actions angered reformers, and they threatened a run on the banks under the rallying cry "''Stop the Duke, go for gold!''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the [[List of recessions in the United States|recessions in the United States]] were caused by banking panics. The Great Depression contained several banking crises consisting of runs on multiple banks from 1929 to 1933; some of these were specific to regions of the U.S.&lt;ref name=Wicker&gt;{{cite book |author= Wicker, E. |title= The Banking Panics of the Great Depression |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-521-66346-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bank runs were most common in states whose laws allowed banks to operate only a single branch, dramatically increasing risk compared to banks with multiple branches particularly when single-branch banks were located in areas economically dependent on a single industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Sowell]] (2009, 2010). The Housing Boom and Bust: Revised Edition. Basic Books, {{ISBN|0465019862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banking panics began in the Upper-South in November 1930, one year after the stock market crash, triggered by the collapse of a string of banks in Tennessee and Kentucky, which brought down their correspondent networks. In December, New York City experienced massive bank runs that were contained to the many branches of a single bank. Philadelphia was hit a week later by bank runs that affected several banks, but were successfully contained by quick action by the leading city banks and the Federal Reserve Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L.

[[File:Money supply during the great depression era.png|thumb|upright=1.3| Money supply decreased substantially between [[Black Tuesday]] and the [[Emergency Banking Act|Bank Holiday in March 1933]] when there were massive bank runs across the United States.]]
Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argued that steady withdrawals from banks by nervous depositors ("hoarding") were inspired by news of the fall 1930 bank runs and forced banks to liquidate loans, which directly caused a decrease in the money supply, shrinking the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States (1993 ed.) 301–05, 342–46, 351–52&lt;/ref&gt; Bank runs continued to plague the United States for the next several years.

The [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|global financial crisis that began in 2007]] was centered around market-liquidity failures that were comparable to a bank run. The crisis contained a wave of bank nationalizations, including those associated with [[Northern Rock]] of the UK and [[IndyMac]] of the U.S. This crisis was caused by low real interest rates stimulating an asset price bubble fuelled by new financial products that were not stress tested and that failed in the downturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Natl Inst Econ Rev |year=2008 |volume=206 |issue=1 |pages=5–14 |doi=10.1177/0027950108099838 |author=Barrell, R. |author2=Davis, E.

{{main|Diamond–Dybvig model}}

Under [[fractional-reserve banking]], the type of banking currently used in most [[developed country|developed countries]],  banks retain only a fraction of their [[demand deposit]]s as cash. The remainder is invested in securities and [[loan]]s, whose terms are typically longer than the demand deposits, resulting in an [[asset–liability mismatch]]. No bank has enough [[Bank reserves|reserves]] on hand to cope with all deposits being taken out at once.

Diamond and Dybvig developed an influential model to explain why bank runs occur and why banks issue deposits that are more [[Market liquidity|liquid]] than their assets. According to the model, the bank acts as an intermediary between borrowers who prefer long-maturity loans and depositors who prefer liquid accounts.&lt;ref name=Diamond2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Diamond-Dybvig-1983&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Pol Econ |year=1983 |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=401–19 |title= Bank runs, deposit insurance, and liquidity |author= Diamond, D. W. |author2=Dybvig, P. H. |url=http://minneapolisfed.org/research/QR/QR2412.pdf |format=PDF |doi= 10.1086/261155}} Reprinted (2000) ''Fed Res Bank Mn Q Rev'' '''24''' (1), 14–23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Diamond-Dybvig model provides an example of an economic [[Game theory|game]] with more than one [[Nash equilibrium]], where it is logical for individual depositors to engage in a bank run once they suspect one might start, even though that run will cause the bank to collapse.&lt;ref name=Diamond2007/&gt;

In the model, business investment requires expenditures in the present to obtain returns that take time in coming, for example, spending on machines and buildings now for production in future years. A business or entrepreneur that needs to borrow to finance investment will want to give their investments a long time to generate returns before full repayment, and will prefer long [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] loans, which offer little liquidity to the lender. The same principle applies to individuals and households seeking financing to purchase large-ticket items such as [[House|housing]] or [[automobile]]s. The households and firms who have the money to lend to these businesses may have sudden, unpredictable needs for cash, so they are often willing to lend only on the condition of being guaranteed immediate access to their money in the form of liquid [[demand deposit account]]s, that is, accounts with shortest possible maturity. Since borrowers need money and depositors fear to make these loans individually, banks provide a valuable service by aggregating funds from many individual deposits, portioning them into loans for borrowers, and spreading the risks both of default and sudden demands for cash.&lt;ref name=Diamond2007/&gt; Banks can charge much higher interest on their long-term loans than they pay out on demand deposits, allowing them to earn a profit.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-12023, Berlin, Bankenkrach, Andrang bei der Sparkasse.jpg|thumb|Depositors clamor to withdraw their savings from a bank in Berlin, 13 July 1931]]
If only a few depositors withdraw at any given time, this arrangement works well. Barring some major emergency on a scale matching or exceeding the bank's geographical area of operation, depositors' unpredictable needs for cash are unlikely to occur at the same time; that is, by the [[law of large numbers]], banks can expect only a small percentage of accounts withdrawn on any one day because individual expenditure needs are largely [[correlation|uncorrelated]]. A bank can make loans over a long horizon, while keeping only relatively small amounts of cash on hand to pay any depositors who may demand withdrawals.&lt;ref name=Diamond2007/&gt;

However, if many depositors withdraw all at once, the bank itself (as opposed to individual investors) may run short of liquidity, and depositors will rush to withdraw their money, forcing the bank to liquidate many of its assets at a loss, and eventually to fail. If such a bank were to attempt to call in its loans early, businesses might be forced to disrupt their production while individuals might need to sell their homes and/or vehicles, causing further losses to the larger economy.&lt;ref name=Diamond2007&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Fed Res Bank Richmond Econ Q |year=2007 |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=189–200 |title= Banks and liquidity creation: a simple exposition of the Diamond-Dybvig model |author= Diamond, D. W. |url=http://www.rich.frb.org/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2007/spring/pdf/diamond.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, many if not most debtors would be unable to pay the bank in full on demand and would be forced to declare [[bankruptcy]], possibly affecting other creditors in the process.

A bank run can occur even when started by a false story. Even depositors who know the story is false will have an incentive to withdraw, if they suspect other depositors will believe the story. The story becomes a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].&lt;ref name=Diamond2007/&gt; Indeed, [[Robert K. Merton]], who coined the term ''self-fulfilling prophecy'', mentioned bank runs as a prime example of the concept in his book ''[[Social Theory and Social Structure]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Social Theory and Social Structure]] |author= [[Robert K.

==Systemic banking crisis==
[[File:Bank Run c1933.jpg|thumb|Bank run during the [[Great Depression]] in the United States, February 1933.]]

A bank run is the sudden withdrawal of deposits of just one bank. A ''banking panic'' or ''bank panic'' is a [[financial crisis]] that occurs when many banks suffer runs at the same time, as a [[cascading failure]]. In a ''systemic banking crisis'', all or almost all of the banking capital in a country is wiped out; this can result when regulators ignore [[systemic risk]]s and [[spillover effect]]s.&lt;ref name=imf2008/&gt;

Systemic banking crises are associated with substantial fiscal costs and large output losses. Frequently, emergency liquidity support and blanket guarantees have been used to contain these crises, not always successfully. Although fiscal tightening may help contain market pressures if a crisis is triggered by unsustainable fiscal policies, expansionary fiscal policies are typically used. In crises of liquidity and solvency, central banks can provide liquidity to support illiquid banks. Depositor protection can help restore confidence, although it tends to be costly and does not necessarily speed up economic recovery. Intervention is often delayed in the hope that recovery will occur, and this delay increases the stress on the economy.&lt;ref name=imf2008&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2008/wp08224.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-09-29 |author= Laeven, L. |author2=Valencia, F. |title= Systemic banking crises: a new database |version= IMF WP/08/224 |publisher= International Monetary Fund |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some measures are more effective than others in containing economic fallout and restoring the banking system after a systemic crisis.&lt;ref name=imf2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index747.html |author= Lietaer, B. |author2=Ulanowicz, R. |author3=Goerner, S. |year=2008 |title= Options for managing a systemic bank crisis |journal=S.A.P.I.EN.S |volume=1 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV statement|date=August 2012}} These include establishing the scale of the problem, targeted debt relief programs to distressed borrowers, corporate restructuring programs, recognizing bank losses, and adequately capitalizing banks.&lt;!-- ref name=imf2008 --&gt; Speed of intervention appears to be crucial; intervention is often delayed in the hope that insolvent banks will recover if given liquidity support and relaxation of regulations, and in the end this delay increases stress on the economy.&lt;!-- ref name=imf2008 --&gt; Programs that are targeted, that specify clear quantifiable rules that limit access to preferred assistance, and that contain meaningful standards for capital regulation, appear to be more successful.&lt;!-- ref name=imf2008 --&gt; According to IMF, government-owned asset management companies ([[bad bank]]s) are largely ineffective due to political constraints.&lt;ref name=imf2008/&gt;

A ''silent run'' occurs when the implicit fiscal deficit from a government's unbooked loss exposure{{clarify|date=August 2012}} to [[zombie bank]]s is large enough to deter depositors of those banks.&lt;!-- ref name=Kane --&gt;  As more depositors and investors begin to doubt whether a government can support a country's banking system, the silent run on the system can gather steam, causing the zombie banks' funding costs to increase.&lt;!-- ref name=Kane --&gt; If a zombie bank sells some assets at market value, its remaining assets contain a larger fraction of unbooked losses; if it rolls over its liabilities at increased interest rates, it squeezes its profits along with the profits of healthier competitors.&lt;!-- ref name=Kane --&gt; The longer the silent run goes on, the more benefits are transferred from healthy banks and taxpayers to the zombie banks.&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;{{cite journal |title= Capital movements, banking insolvency, and silent runs in the Asian financial crisis |author= Kane, E. J. |journal= Pac-Basin Finance J |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=153–75 |year=2000 |doi=10.1016/S0927-538X(00)00009-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is also used when a large number of depositors in countries with deposit insurance draw down their balances below the limit for deposit insurance.&lt;ref&gt;Rothacker, Rick. [http://www.charlotteobserver.com/597/story/246983.html $5 billion withdrawn in one day in silent run] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120723213502/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/597/story/246983.html |date=2012-07-23 }}.  ''[[The Charlotte Observer]]'', 2008-10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of cleaning up after a crisis can be huge. In systemically important banking crises in the world from 1970 to 2007, the average net recapitalization cost to the government was 6% of [[GDP]], fiscal costs associated with crisis management averaged 13% of GDP (16% of GDP if expense recoveries are ignored), and economic output losses averaged about 20% of GDP during the first four years of the crisis.&lt;ref name=imf2008/&gt;

==Prevention and mitigation==
[[Image:Northern Rock Queue.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nationalisation of Northern Rock#Run on the bank|2007 run on Northern Rock]], a UK bank, during the [[late-2000s financial crisis]].]]
[[File:Response of malicious rumours of BEA on 24 Sept 2008.jpg|thumbnail|A run on a [[Bank of East Asia]] branch in Hong Kong, caused by "malicious rumours" in 2008.]]

Several techniques have been used to help prevent or mitigate bank runs.

=== Individual banks ===
Some prevention techniques apply to individual banks, independently of the rest of the economy.
* Banks often project an appearance of stability, with solid architecture and conservative dress.&lt;ref name="planet_money"&gt;{{cite news|agency=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=154719542|title=Three Ways To Stop A Bank Run|date=2012-06-11|author=Zoe Chase}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A bank may try to hide information that might spark a run.&lt;!-- ref name=Diamond2007 --&gt; For example, in the days before deposit insurance, it made sense for a bank to have a large lobby and fast service, to prevent the formation of a line of depositors extending out into the street which might cause passers-by to infer a bank run.&lt;ref name=Diamond2007/&gt;
* A bank may try to slow down the bank run by artificially slowing the process.  One technique is to get a large number of friends and family of bank employees to stand in line and make a large number of small, slow transactions.&lt;ref name="planet_money" /&gt;
* Scheduling prominent deliveries of cash can convince participants in a bank run that there is no need to withdraw deposits hastily.&lt;ref name="planet_money" /&gt;
* Banks can encourage customers to make [[term deposit]]s that cannot be withdrawn on demand. If term deposits form a high enough percentage of a bank's liabilities its vulnerability to bank runs will be reduced considerably. The drawback is that banks have to pay a higher interest rate on term deposits.
* A bank can temporarily suspend withdrawals to stop a run; this is called ''suspension of convertibility''. In many cases the threat of suspension prevents the run, which means the threat need not be carried out.&lt;ref name=Diamond2007/&gt;
* Emergency acquisition of a vulnerable bank by another institution with stronger capital reserves.  This technique is commonly used by the U.S. [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] to dispose of insolvent banks, rather than paying depositors directly from its own funds.&lt;ref name="anatomy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102384657|date=2009-03-26|title=Anatomy Of A Bank Takeover|agency=NPR|author=Chana Joffe-Walt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If there is no immediate prospective buyer for a failing institution, a regulator or deposit insurer may set up a [[bridge bank]] which operates temporarily until the business can be liquidated or sold.
* To clean up after a bank failure, the government may set up a "[[bad bank]]", which is a new government-run asset management corporation that buys individual nonperforming assets from one or more private banks, reducing the proportion of junk bonds in their asset pools, and then acts as the creditor in the insolvency cases that follow. This, however, creates a [[moral hazard]] problem, essentially subsidizing bankruptcy: temporarily underperforming debtors can be forced to file for bankruptcy in order to make them eligible to be sold to the bad bank.

=== Systemic techniques ===
Some prevention techniques apply across the whole economy, though they may still allow individual institutions to fail.&lt;!-- ref name=Brusco --&gt;
* [[Deposit insurance]] systems insure each depositor up to a certain amount, so that depositors' savings are protected even if the bank fails. This removes the incentive to withdraw one's deposits simply because others are withdrawing theirs.&lt;ref name=Diamond2007/&gt; However, depositors may still be motivated by fears they may lack immediate access to deposits during a bank reorganization.&lt;ref name="WaMu-LAT"&gt;{{cite news |author= Reckard, E. S. |author2=Hsu, T. |title= U.S. engineers sale of WaMu to JPMorgan |work= Los Angeles Times |date=2008-09-26 |accessdate=2008-09-26 |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wamu26-2008sep26,0,614943.story}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To avoid such fears triggering a run, the U.S. FDIC keeps its takeover operations secret, and re-opens branches under new ownership on the next business day.&lt;ref name="anatomy" /&gt;  Government deposit insurance programs can be ineffective if the government itself is perceived to be running short of cash.&lt;ref name="planet_money" /&gt;
* Bank [[capital requirement]]s reduces the possibility that a bank becomes insolvent. The [[Basel III]] agreement strengthens bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage.
** [[Full-reserve banking]] is the hypothetical case where the reserve ratio is set to 100%, and funds deposited are not lent out by the bank as long as the depositor retains the legal right to withdraw the funds on demand. Under this approach, banks would be forced to match maturities of loans and deposits, thus greatly reducing the risk of bank runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Allen, W. R. |title= Irving Fisher and the 100 percent reserve proposal |journal= J Law Econ |year=1993 |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=703–17 |doi=10.1086/467295}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= Does Argentina provide a case for narrow banking? |vauthors= Fernandez R, Schumacher L |pages=21–46 |year=1997 |booktitle=Preventing Banking Sector Distress and Crises in Latin America |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/02/24/000009265_3971031092501/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf |veditors= Bery SK, Garcia VF |isbn= 0-8213-3893-5 |others= World Bank Discussion Paper No. 360, |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** A less severe alternative to full-reserve banking is a [[reserve ratio]] requirement, which limits the proportion of deposits which a bank can lend out, making it less likely for a bank run to start, as more reserves will be available to satisfy the demands of depositors.&lt;ref name=Heffernan&gt;{{cite book |author= Heffernan, S. |chapter= The causes of bank failures |pages=366–402 |veditors=Mullineux AW, Murinde V |title= Handbook of international banking |year=2003 |publisher= Edward Elgar |isbn=1-84064-093-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice sets a limit on the fraction in [[fractional-reserve banking]].
* [[Transparency (market)|Transparency]] may help prevent crises spreading through the banking system. In the context of the recent crisis, the extreme complexity of certain types of assets made it difficult for market participants to assess which financial institutions would survive, which amplified the crisis by making most institutions very reluctant to lend to one another.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* [[Central banks]] act as a [[lender of last resort]]. To prevent a bank run, the central bank guarantees that it will make short-term loans to banks, to ensure that, if they remain economically viable, they will always have enough liquidity to honor their deposits.&lt;ref name=Diamond2007/&gt; [[Walter Bagehot]]'s book [[Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market|Lombard Street]] provides influential early analysis of the role of the [[lender of last resort]].

The role of the lender of last resort, and the existence of deposit insurance, both create [[moral hazard]], since they reduce banks' incentive to avoid making risky loans. They are nonetheless standard practice, as the benefits of collective prevention are commonly believed to outweigh the costs of excessive risk-taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Finance |year=2007 |volume=62 |issue=5 |pages=2275–302 |title= Liquidity coinsurance, moral hazard, and financial contagion |author= Brusco, S. |author2=Castiglionesi, F. |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01275.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques to deal with a banking panic when prevention have failed:
* Declaring an emergency [[Emergency Banking Act|bank holiday]]
* Government or central bank announcements of increased lines of credit, loans, or bailouts for vulnerable banks

==Depictions in fiction==
The bank panic of 1933 is the setting of [[Archibald MacLeish]]'s 1935 play, ''[[Panic (1935 play)|Panic]]''. Other fictional depictions of bank runs include those in ''[[American Madness]]'' (1932), ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946), ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), ''[[Noble House (miniseries)|Noble House]]'' (1988) and ''[[The Pope Must Die]]'' (1991)

[[Arthur Hailey]]'s novel ''[[The Moneychangers]]'' includes a potentially fatal run on a fictitious US bank.

A run on a bank is one of the many causes of the characters' suffering in Upton Sinclair's ''[[The Jungle]]''.

The nomadic tribes sign the four cardinal points by colors: the North is "black", West is "white", South is "red", and East is "blue".

Black Hungarians are mentioned in just a few contemporary sources (sometimes in opposition to ''White Hungarians''); none of the sources expands upon the exact nature of the relationship between the Black Magyars and the "mainstream" Hungarian population, nor is the origin and meaning of their name clear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frego.li/c64-a-feher-es-fekete-magyarok A fehér és a fekete magyarok]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known that they participated in some military campaign in Kiev; after the conquest, they resisted the [[Christian]] [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] even after the coronation of King [[Stephen I of Hungary]] in 1000 or 1001. In 1003, [[Bruno of Querfurt]] tried to convert the Black Hungarians; then Azzo, a [[papal legate]], led the missionary work among them, but they insisted on their faith; therefore some of them were blinded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno of Querfurt]]: ''Vita quinque fratrum eremitarum; Vita vel passio Benedicti et Iohannis sociorumque suorum''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1008, King [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]] made a campaign against them and conquered their territories ("Black Hungary").&lt;ref&gt;[[Adémar de Chabannes]]: ''[[Historia pontificum et comitum Engolismensium]]''.{{Clarify|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He probably set up the [[Diocese of Pécs]] on the conquered region in 1009.

'''Chello''' was the [[brand]] of [[internet service provider]]-activities of [[Liberty Global Europe]] (formerly UGC), a provider of broadband internet access via [[DOCSIS|cable]] in Europe, with estimated 1.3 million customers across its markets. LGE operates in 15 European, 4 Latin American and 2 Asian/Pacific countries. The Chello branded internet service were available in seven of these: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Hungary]], The [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]] and [[Slovakia]].{{Citation needed|reason=These are 8 Countries, also I'd expect this kind of sentence at a Pubquiz, not on wikipedia.|date=November 2018}} The Chello brand was introduced in the European market in 1998 and was awarded the best Consumer ISP award in 1999 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHELLO BROADBAND WINS BEST CONSUMER ISP AWARD 1999|url=http://pressreleases.responsesource.com/news/5170/chello-broadband-wins-best-consumer-isp-award-1999/|website=Response Source|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Features of the Chello service are standardized according to the cable provider. In each market Chello delivered open-access content portals that featured local news and entertainment content.  Also, all users of the service were granted email addresses.

Chello products were typically available at many speeds and are named Chello Starter, Chello Easy, Chello Classic, Chello Plus and Chello Extreme.

The Chello brand appears to have been replaced by other brands. For example, in The Netherlands, Chello has been renamed to [[UPC Broadband|UPC]] Live. UPC Live also has replaced Chello in Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. In Sweden, Chello has been replaced by ComHem, and in Norway, by Get. In Ireland, UPC Ireland took over the broadband and cable service NTL in 2005, having previously bought another Irish cable provider - Chorus. In 2015, UPC in Ireland was rebranded as Virgin Media Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Belgium, Chello was a product of UPC that was absorbed by Telenet in 2006 when Liberty Global bought a majority stake in Telenet.

The brand was available in [[New Zealand]] in the early 2000s, under [[TelstraClear|TelstraSaturn]]'s cable network.

[[File:STS059-238-074 Strait of Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|right|The Strait of Gibraltar is an important naval choke point, as just a few ships could block the entry to the whole Mediterranean Sea.]]
In military strategy, a '''choke point''' (or '''chokepoint''') is a geographical feature on land such as a valley, [[defile (geography)|defile]] or a bridge or at sea such as a [[strait]], which an armed force is forced to pass, sometimes on a substantially narrower [[front (military)|front]] and therefore greatly decreasing its combat power, to reach its [[goal|objective]]. A choke point can allow a numerically inferior defending force to thwart a larger opponent if the attacker cannot [[force concentration|bring superior numbers to bear]].

==Historical examples==
Some historical examples of the tactical use of choke points are King [[Leonidas I]]'s defense of the [[Battle of Thermopylae|Pass of Thermopylae]] during an invasion led by [[Xerxes I of Persia]]; the [[Battle Of Stamford Bridge]] in which [[Harold Godwinson]] defeated [[Harald Hardrada]]; [[William Wallace]]'s victory over the English at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] (Wallace had around 2,300 men against the English army of about 9,000 to 12,000 men and the bridge collapsed during the battle); and the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in which [[Henry V of England]] decisively defeated the French when they were forced to attack his smaller army through a narrow gap in the Agincourt Woods.

It was the suitability of the [[Caribbean]] as a chokepoint that attracted [[pirates]] and [[buccaneers]] during the 17th century. The Spanish treasure fleets leaving the Americas would need to pass there to pick up the strong, prevailing, westerly winds that would take them back to Spain.

The most important naval choke points were first identified by Fisher in his defence of continued British colonialism (important colonies in parentheses):&lt;ref name="Breverton 2010 169"&gt;{{cite book |title=Breverton's Nautical Curiosities|last= Breverton|first=Terry |authorlink=Terry Breverton |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Quercus Publishing PLC |location=21 Bloomsbury Square, London|isbn=978-1-84724-776-6 |page=169 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Strait of Hormuz|Hormuz Strait]] between [[Oman]] and [[Iran]] at the entrance to the [[Persian Gulf]]
* [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] passage from the [[Arabian Sea]] to the [[Red Sea]] ([[Yemen]] and [[Socotra]])
* [[Strait of Malacca]] between [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]
* [[Panama Canal]] and the [[Trans-Panama Pipeline|Panama Pipeline]] connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans ([[British Honduras]])
* [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Sumed pipeline|Sumed Pipeline]] connecting the [[Red Sea]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]] ([[Egypt]])
* [[Strait of Gibraltar]] along the [[Atlantic Ocean]] entering the [[Mediterranean Sea]] ([[Spain]], [[Gibraltar]] and [[Morocco]])
* [[Strait of Dover]] or [[English Channel]] separating the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[North Sea]] ([[England]] and [[France]])
* [[Strait of Magellan]] at [[Cape Horn]] ([[Chile]])
* The [[Cape of Good Hope]] (South Africa)
* [[Bering Strait]] ([[United States of America]] and [[Russia]])
* [[Bosporus]] Strait linking the [[Black Sea]] (and oil coming from the [[Caspian Sea]] region) to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] ([[Turkey]])
* [[Dardanelles]] Strait connecting the [[Sea of Marmara]] with the [[Aegean Sea]] ([[Turkey]])
* [[Strait of Tartary]] along [[Sea of Japan]] and [[Sea of Okhotsk]] ([[Russia]])

The [[Fulda Gap]] was seen as one of the potentially decisive bottleneck battlegrounds of the [[Cold War]] in [[Germany]].

==Royal Navy choke points==

From the 18th to the early 20th centuries, the sheer size of the  United Kingdom's [[Royal Navy]] meant it had control over much of the world's oceans and seas. Choke points were of huge importance to the [[British Empire]], which often used them to control trade in British colonies and, to a lesser extent, for defense. Choke points have also been a source of tension, notably during the [[Suez Crisis]]. The Royal Navy still deems its choke points as strategically vital. Indeed, the importance of choke points was first recognised by British Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher]].&lt;ref name="Breverton 2010 169"/&gt;
[[File:English Channel.jpg|alt=A map of the English Channel, south of England, north of France|thumb|228x228px|The [[English Channel]], a choke point south of England and north of [[France]]]]
These are major British choke points today:
* The [[English Channel]]
* [[GIUK gap]] (between Greenland, Iceland, and UK)
* [[Strait of Gibraltar]]

The choke points still have significant strategic importance for the Royal Navy. The GIUK gap is particularly important to the Royal Navy, as any attempt by northern European forces to break into the open Atlantic would have to do so through the heavily defended English Channel, which is also the world's busiest shipping lane, or through one of the exits on either side of [[Iceland]]. Considering British control over the strategic fortress of [[Gibraltar]] at the entrance to the Mediterranean, Spain (northern coast), France (Atlantic coast) and Portugal are the only mainland European nations that have direct access to the Atlantic Ocean in a way that cannot be easily blocked at a choke point by the Royal Navy. The GIUK gap was also a strategically important part of the [[Cold War]], as the Royal Navy were given the responsibility of keeping an eye on [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarines trying to break into the open Atlantic.

==Importance==
Choke points remain a prominent issue today in the global economy and shipments of goods, particularly oil: 20% of the world's oil is shipped through the [[Strait of Hormuz]], which has seen conflicts such as the downing of [[Iran Air Flight 655]] by American missiles in 1988. The [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Sumed pipeline]] carry {{convert|4.5|Moilbbl|usgal m3}} a day, and the canal carried a total of 7.5% of world trade in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1102/S00019/egypt-will-us-and-nato-launch-second-suez-intervention.htm|title=Egypt: Will U.S. And NATO Launch Second Suez Intervention?|publisher=Scoop.co.nz|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The canal was closed for eight years after the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. In many instances, alternate routes are nonexistent or impractical. For example, an alternate to the Suez/Sumed route required an additional {{convert|6000|mi|km}} around [[Cape of Good Hope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/World_Oil_Transit_Chokepoints/Background.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313132809/http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/World_Oil_Transit_Chokepoints/Background.html |date=March 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Navy]] also still deems its choke points to the Atlantic as strategically important.

It was founded in 2003 to replace the Multidisciplinary Group on International Action Against Terrorism (GMT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/e/legal%5Faffairs/legal%5Fco%2Doperation/fight%5Fagainst%5Fterrorism/3%5FCODEXTER/ Council of Europe website] accessed 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the principal functions of the organisation is to make profiles of each member's [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[institution]]al [[counter-terrorism]] plans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://security.homeoffice.gov.uk/counter-terrorism-strategy/working-with-partners/international/council-europe United Kingdom Home Office website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006021058/http://security.homeoffice.gov.uk/counter-terrorism-strategy/working-with-partners/international/council-europe |date=2008-10-06 }} accessed 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These profiles are short reports on member states' counter-terrorism measures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081012161324/http://www.libertysecurity.org/auteur666.html "Committee of Experts on Terrorism (Codexter) - Profiles on Counter-Terrorist Capacity"] accessed 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Amnesty International]] has urged CODEXTER to delete the last paragraph of the organisation's Preamble, which attempts to define [[terrorism]], as it ''"does not sufficiently distinguish between unlawful acts and legitimate, non-violent opposition to the actions or non-action of states"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/aidoc/ai.nsf/2409a336a83fd4e480256ef400540aa8/25364ddaad044c9980256faf0068a86a!OpenDocument Amnesty International’s representations on the February 2005 draft Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism], accessed 4 March 2008 via [https://web.archive.org/web/20110520093249/http://web.amnesty.org/aidoc/ai.nsf/2409a336a83fd4e480256ef400540aa8/25364ddaad044c9980256faf0068a86a!OpenDocument Google's cache of the page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Comorian passport''' is issued to citizens of the [[Comoros|Union of the Comoros]] for international travel. As of 1 January 2017, Comorian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 48 countries and territories, ranking the Comorian passport 88th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Algerian, Cambodian, Egyptian, Guinean and Laotian passports) according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Henley visa restrictions index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Visa Restriction Index 2017|url=https://henleyglobal.com/files/download/hvri/HP_Visa_Restrictions_Index_170301.pdf|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Free Imperial City of Kempten''' was a [[Free Imperial City]] in the [[Swabian Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;"Kempten". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 20 Oct. 2012 http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/314674/Kempten&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1213, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II of Hohenstaufen|Frederick II]] declared the abbots of [[Kempten Abbey]] members of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] and granted the abbot the right to bear the title of Duke, making the abbey the [[Imperial Ducal Abbey of Kempten]].

In 1289, King [[Rudolf of Habsburg]] granted special privileges to the settlement in the river valley, making it an [[Free Imperial City|Imperial City]]. In 1525 the last property rights of the abbots in the Imperial City were sold in the so-called "Great Purchase", marking the start of the co-existence of two independent cities bearing the same name next to each other. 

The Imperial City converted to [[Protestantism]] in direct opposition to the [[Catholic]] monastery in 1527, signing the [[Augsburg Confession]].

During the turmoil of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1632–33), the city was destroyed by imperial forces.

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the Imperial City came under Bavarian rule (1802–03). In 1819, the city was united with the properties of the Abbey into a single communal entity.

The '''Guinean Press Agency''' ({{lang-fr|Agence Guinéenne de Presse}}) ('''AGP''') is a press agency in [[Guinea]]. It was run by the government under [[Sékou Touré]] and provided daily news updates to the other government officials and international diplomatic corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=O'Toole, Thomas |author2=Baker, Janice E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIiHwg3Y5u4C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Historical+dictionary+of+Guinea+Guinean+Press+Agency#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Historical Dictionary of Guinea|publisher=Volume 94 of African historical dictionaries, [[Scarecrow Press]]|year=2005|page=3|isbn=0-8108-4634-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montreal: China AIDS Survey, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the first indigenous cases were reported as an outbreak in 146 infected [[heroin]] users in [[Yunnan]] province, near [[Southwest China|China's southwest]] border.&lt;ref&gt;Ma Y, Li ZZ, Zhang KX. Identifi cation of HIV infection among drug users in China. Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi 1990; 11:184–85 (in Chinese).&lt;/ref&gt;

Yunnan is the area most affected by [[HIV/AIDS in the People's Republic of China|HIV/AIDS in China]]. In 1989 first infections appeared among needle sharing drug users near the [[Burma|Burmese]] border. Up until 1993, the disease had remained a problem in the border areas before mobile people (truck drivers, construction and migrant workers and travelers) brought the virus further into the country. In 1995, the provinces of [[Sichuan]] and [[Xinjiang]] reported their first HIV cases, and by 1998, the virus had spread all over China.

Low awareness of the disease among China's general population appears to be a major culprit. Most Chinese consider HIV/AIDS as a foreign issue{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}, and even educated people are less knowledgeable of the virus, its transmission and prevention, than people in other countries. Until recently, the use of condoms was not very common, even among sex workers and their clients. As a result, the epidemic has spread from high-risk groups (drug users, sex workers, unsafe blood donors) to the general population.

==Heroin flow==
Heroin flows into Yunnan Province from neighboring [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and [[Myanmar]], bringing with it HIV. The province's first cases were reported in 1989. With a population of 44 million, Yunnan now has only 200 health workers trained for the disease. Officials estimate that the province has 80,000 infected people, most of them [[intravenous]] drug users who have spread the disease by sharing needles. In [[Gejiu]], a city of 310,000 people on a route favored by drug traffickers, initial rounds of [[AIDS]] testing in recent years found more than 1,000 people with HIV, nearly all drug users or prostitutes. Unlike some other provinces, Yunnan has welcomed international nonprofit groups and support from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Australia]], and more recently the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Chinese City Emerges As Model in AIDS Fight (June 16) by JIM YARDLEY.

=='3 Needles'==
[[Image:GaoYaojie2-70 percent.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Dr. [[Gao Yaojie]], a [[gynecologist]] and AIDS activist from [[Henan]] province.]]

''[[3 Needles]]'' is a 2005 dramatic film depicting the lives of people in Yunnan during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. One of the film's protagonists, a pregnant black-market operative played by [[Lucy Liu]], makes her living as a blood smuggler. But when several blood donors begin to get sick and die, she realizes that she may have jeopardized the health of the village's safety and beyond. ''3 Needles'' is an attempt to visualize the profound experience of [[Gao Yaojie]] and many others as we can read in [[The New York Times]] sequel.&lt;ref&gt;Detained AIDS Doctor Allowed to Visit U.S. Later, China Says (February 17); China Covers Up Detention of AIDS Doctor (February 16); China Places AIDS Activist Under House Arrest (February 6) by JIM YARDLEY.

On the basis of the successes of the pilot, the programme was expanded in 2004, and plans are in place to open an additional 1500 [[methadone]] maintenance treatment clinics for about 300 000 heroin users by 2008. A National Training Centre for methadone maintenance treatment has been established in Yunnan to provide clinical and technical support.

==Commercial sex==
Commercial sex work is illegal in the People's Republic of China; hence, brothels are illegal and commercial sex workers operate out of places of entertainment (e.g., karaoke bars), hotels, hair-dressing salons, or on the street.&lt;ref&gt;Gil VE, Wang MS, Anderson AF, Lin GM, Wu ZO.

==Numbers==
In 2002, a [[United Nations]]-commissioned report, entitled ''China's Titanic peril'',&lt;ref&gt;Eldis gateway. HIV/AIDS: China's Titanic peril: 2001 update of the AIDS situation and needs assessment report. UNAIDS, 2002. http://www.eldis.org/static/DOC9892.htm (accessed Oct 26, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; estimating that the People's Republic of China had about 1 million cases of HIV, and that it was on the brink of an "explosive HIV/AIDS epidemic…with an imminent risk to widespread dissemination to the general population". The report continued: "a potential HIV/AIDS disaster of unimaginable proportion now lies in wait." A few months later, the US [[National Intelligence Council]] estimated that 1-2 million people were living with HIV in People's Republic of China, and predicted 10–15 million cases by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;National Intelligence Council. The next wave of HIV/AIDS: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Russia, India, China. ICA 2002-04 D. September, 2002: https://fas.org/irp/nic/hiv-aids.html (accessed Oct 26, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports at this time were similarly pessimistic: from the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] (Washington, DC, USA), HIV/AIDS was referred to as China's time-bomb;&lt;ref&gt;Bates G, Morrison SJ, Thompson D, eds.

A joint assessment of HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care in China. Beijing: China Ministry of Health, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; developed jointly by [[UNAIDS]] and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]], estimated that the country had 840,000 people living with HIV/AIDS. This figure was revised down to 650,000 in 2005 in light of more representative data collection and more appropriate estimation methods.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China, UNAIDS, WHO. 2005 update on the HIV/AIDS epidemic and response in  China. Beijing: Ministry of Health, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yunnan ahead==
Yunnan province has shown strong support for implementation and advocacy of harm-reduction strategies that reduce HIV transmission in its many drug users, whereas [[Henan]] province had been slower to respond to the needs of former plasma donors in the early stages of the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;Watts J. AIDS in China: new legislation, old doubts. Lancet 2006; 367: 803–04&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of HIV in China is not even, and is concentrated in areas with high drug use (i.e. Yunnan, Guangxi, Xinjiang, and Sichuan) and in areas where people were infected through unsafe blood or plasma donation (i.e. [[Henan]], [[Anhui]], [[Hebei]], [[Shanxi]], and [[Hubei]]). The number of cases ranges dramatically between provinces (see the map of China on your right), with, for example, just 20 cases reported from [[Tibet]] but well over 40,000 in neighbouring Yunnan.

==Yunnan Red Cross==

[[Yunnan Red Cross]] was one of the first non-government organizations fighting [[HIV/AIDS in China]]. It was established in 1994, as an adaptation of the [[Australian Red Cross]], and is operating five projects in various locations throughout the province.

The '''Memorandum by Her Majesty's Government on the Report of the Constitution Committee''', or the '''Hattersley Memorandum''' for short (by [[Roy Hattersley]], Minister of State, [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] of the United Kingdom), dated 26 June 1976, was the answer of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] British Government to proposed constitutional changes in [[Gibraltar]] ruling out the possibility of integration of Gibraltar with the [[United Kingdom]].

In September 1975, [[Roy Hattersley]] (a Minister in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]) had visited Gibraltar and made it clear that the integration with the United Kingdom was not an option for Gibraltar.&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{cite book | first = Peter | last = Gold | title = Gibraltar: British or Spanish?  | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b6SgDQvP3zMC&amp;lpg=PR6&amp;dq=Gold%2C%20Peter%20(2005).%20Gibraltar%3A%20British%20or%20Spanish%3F.%20Routledge.%20p.%2022&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn = 0-415-34795-5 | pages = 22 | year = 2005 | publisher = Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book | first = William | last = Jackson | year = 1990 | title = The Rock of the Gibraltarians. A History of Gibraltar | publisher = Gibraltar Books | edition = 2nd | location = Grendon, Northamptonshire, UK | isbn = 0-948466-14-6 | pages = 323}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, during early 1976, a Gibraltarian inter-party Constitution Committee began to work on a proposal of constitutional changes that involved a further integration of Gibraltar with the United Kingdom. A delegation of the Constitution Committee visited [[London]] in June 1976, but were unable to convince the United Kingdom Government which, as response, issued a memorandum dated 26 June 1976 rejecting the proposals on the grounds of "avoid innovations which might result in prolongation of the frontier restrictions imposed by [[Spain]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1976/aug/03/gibraltar Written answer of Mr. Hattersley to Mrs. Hart], HC Deb 3 August 1976 vol 916 cc726-7W.&lt;/ref&gt; The memorandum ruled out the option of integration of Gibraltar with the United Kingdom.

Apart for removing such an option from the constitutional and political development of Gibraltar, it effectively disbanded the [[Integration with Britain Party]], which had been in office from 1969 to 1972, and was the main supporter of the integration of Gibraltar into the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foghs.org.uk/nl/68.pdf Obituary of former governor John Grandy], by [[Maurice Xiberras]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2696">The '''Idakho''' ''(Abitakho, Idakho, Abidakho)'' are a [[Luhya people|Luhya]] sub-group that reside primarily in the fertile [[Kakamega District]], [[Western Kenya]].  Idakho is administratively known as Ikolomani, Ikolomani being the only Constituency in the region.

As is the case with the wider Western Province, Idakho, Kakamega is densely populated with its 2007 population estimated at having surpassed 150,000.
 
It is widely believed that the Bidakho are descendants of Mwitakho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Abeingo Community Network |url=http://www.abeingo.org/HTML_files/idakho.html |title=Abeingo Community Network |publisher=Abeingo.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scarcity of land and the Bidakho's changing lifestyles have made the people diversify with many today engaging in dairy farming and on a smaller scale, tea farming. Maize however is the most widely grown crop, supplying their staple food, bushuma. It is harvested bi-annually.  
  
The traditional life however only serves as a supplement to their 'modern' family life.

Enjoying good levels of literacy (62%), Bidakho today are actively engaged in business, the civil service and private enterprise in all major East African towns.

'''Intelsat 508''', previously named '''Intelsat V F-8''', was a [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Intelsat]]. Launched in 1984, it was the eighth of fifteen [[Intelsat V]] satellites to be launched. The Intelsat V series was constructed by [[Ford Aerospace]], based on the [[Spacebus|Intelsat-V]] [[satellite bus]]. Intelsat V F-8 was part of an advanced series of satellites designed to provide greater telecommunications capacity for [[Intelsat]]'s global network.

The satellite was successfully launched into space on October 19, 1983, at 00:45 UTC, by means of an [[Ariane 1]] vehicle from the [[Guiana Space Centre]], [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]]. It had a launch mass of 1,928&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="TBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_intelsat_508.html|title=INTELSAT 508|publisher=TSE|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intelsat V F-8 was equipped with 4 [[Ku-band]] transponders more 21 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] [[transponder]]s for 12,000 audio circuits and 2 TV channels.

The '''International Anti-Poaching Foundation''' ('''IAPF''') is a [[not-for-profit|non-profit]] organisation registered in Australia, predominately operating on the African continent.&lt;ref name=age&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/a-different-battle-20121125-2a25x.html|title=A different battle|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iapf.org|title=IAPF - International Anti-poaching Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has a structured military-like approach to conservation, employing tactics and technology generally reserved for the modern-day battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iapf.org/images/documents/riseofthedronesjan2013.pdf Rise of the Drones – Africa Geographic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124230/http://www.iapf.org/images/documents/riseofthedronesjan2013.pdf |date=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following service in [[Iraq]] spanning 12 years of duty, former Australian naval clearance diver and special operations sniper [[Damien Mander]]&lt;ref name=age/&gt; headed for Africa with the intention of using his niche skills for conservation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beta.mnet.co.za/carteblanche/Article.aspx?Id=4613&amp;Showid=1 Damien's Rhino – Carte Blanche] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130421223808/http://beta.mnet.co.za/carteblanche/Article.aspx?Id=4613&amp;Showid=1 |date=21 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beat.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beat.com.au/category/machine-tags/damien-mander|title=Damien Mander - Beat Magazine|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was initially to be a short adventure quickly turned into an obsession as Mander observed first-hand the harsh realities that front-line rangers and wildlife face on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindfood.com/at-conservation-rambo-damien-mander.seo Conservation Rambo – Mindfood, Smart Thinking]&lt;/ref&gt; Liquidating his life savings and real estate portfolio accumulated from nine years of military service, Mander founded the IAPF in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8095372|title=Damien’s War|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon joined by his working colleague, wartime veteran and friend of 11 years, Steven Dean. The pair now operate the IAPF in Africa, spending most of the year on the ground protecting wildlife.&lt;ref name=ia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africamediaonline.com/mmc/gallery/detail/events/anti-poaching-in-zim|title=Anti Poaching in Zim - Africa Media Online|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across much of Africa [[anti-poaching]] tactics have remained largely unchanged for decades.&lt;ref name="blogs.abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/nsw/2012/11/tales-from-the-anti-poaching-battlefield.html|title=Tales from the anti-poaching battlefield|date=29 November 2012|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small groups of undertrained and poorly equipped rangers are sent out for days on end to conduct patrols in remote and dangerous locations. Modern-day poachers have evolved and routinely utilise military tactics and equipment to kill individual members of high-target species, such as elephants, [[rhinos]] and [[gorilla]]s. Seeing this shortfall, the IAPF set out to fill the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhino-dialogues.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Use-of-Drones-in-elephant-poaching.pdf|title=Unmanned Drones in Conservation – Rhino Dialogs Website|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What initially started out as a training organisation quickly expanded into a community outreach, management, and research-orientated outfit, capable of running autonomously or alongside existing projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2.blogtalkradio.com/urbanjunglesradio/2012/12/01/ujr-presents-damien-mander-of-iapf|title=UJR Presents: Damien Mander of IAPF|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IAPF Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iapf.org|title=IAPF - International Anti-poaching Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
The organisation has a strong emphasis on public relations, and the media has responded well to the story of two transformed soldiers now dedicated to conservation and to encouraging a modern generation to stand up and have more empathy for animals and the environment.&lt;ref name="Jungle Warfare – 60 Minutes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8553858|title=Jungle Warfare|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mander is an outspoken animal activist who is not afraid to publicly voice his views on critical environmental issues, from poaching to increased human pressures on wilderness areas.&lt;ref name="702.co.za"&gt;[http://www.702.co.za/onair/heardonair.asp?action=mainsearch The war against poachers – 702 Talk Radio South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, three separate nominations at The [[Humane Society]] of the United States' 28th annual [[Genesis Awards]] featured stories on the IAPF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanesociety.org/about/events/genesis_awards/27th_nominees.html Nominees of the 2013 Genesis Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; These awards honour animal welfare issues in the media.

In 2010, the TV program [[60 Minutes]] travelled to [[Victoria Falls]], [[Zimbabwe]] to film IAPF operations. This showcased to a large audience the plight of the black rhinoceros, listed as critically endangered and under increasing threat as the price of their horns continues to rise steeply in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8095372|title=Damien’s War|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, 60 Minutes filmed the IAPF using unmanned drones (UAVs) in Mozambique's Niassa National Reserve.&lt;ref name="Jungle Warfare – 60 Minutes"/&gt;

''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' shadowed the IAPF whilst writing its feature article "Rhino Wars." The article (which earned a first prize world press photo award for Brent Stirton&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldpressphoto.org/photo/2012-brent-stirton-nas1-hl?gallery=2634 Nature 1st prize stories – World Press Photo]&lt;/ref&gt;) covered organised crime's role in poaching, the pros and cons if the rhino horn trade were legalised, and the militarised ranger training and operations that the IAPF delivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2012/03/rhino-wars/gwin-text|title=National Geographic Magazine - NGM.com|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAPF is governed by a board of directors in Australia, a [[board of trustees]] in Zimbabwe, and an international advisory board.&lt;ref name=ia/&gt; It is independently audited annually. Registered as a [[not-for-profit|non-profit]](ABN 57142987782), the majority of its funding comes from the Australian general public.

The IAPF has attracted the attention and support of [[Monaco's]] Conservation Guardians, an organisation on whose board Mander sits as a Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verybest.com/ezine/135/908/0/conservation-guardians--philanthropy-for-fauna-and-flora/|title=Conservation Guardians, Philanthropy for Flora And Fauna – VeryBest.com|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iapf.org/images/documents/hola3536donatellaknecht.pdf Donatella Knecht de Massy y su marido, Sebastien, en su mansión de Mónaco] ''Hello Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, [[Damien Mander]] made a presentation about the plight of animals in today's society in a TEDx presentation held at the Sydney Opera House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FCsyK4aRXQ|title=Modern Warrior: Damien Mander at TEDxSydney|first=|last=TEDx Talks|date=15 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==

The IAPF has established two full-time operational centres. The first, combined with IAPF's headquarters, is based on the Stanley &amp; Livingstone Private Game Reserve 13&amp;nbsp;km from [[Victoria Falls]] in Zimbabwe. On this Big Five game (lion, African elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard, rhinoceros) reserve&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarongekoski.com/pdf/85513200352176_menshealtharticle.pdf My year of living Dangerously – Men's Health Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; is a training academy where rangers from Zimbabwe receive basic and intermediate training.&lt;ref name=ia/&gt; The team also operates an anti-poaching unit, protecting the breeding program of black rhinos on the reserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeslive.co.za/lifestyle/2011/10/02/wildlife-war-zone-hero Wildlife war zone hero – ''The Sunday Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst no rhinos have been killed under the IAPF's watch, the nearest population at Sinamatella in [[Hwange National Park]] (100&amp;nbsp;km east) has tragically declined at the hands of poachers—from 74 down to just four rhinos in the space of a mere six years.&lt;ref name="702.co.za"/&gt; Despite the reserve sitting in a prime position for poaching (close to 4 international borders and surrounded by a population of 85,000 people – 60,000 of whom are unemployed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/zimbabwe-battling-to-keep-rhino-poaching-in-check-1.1105721|title=Zimbabwe battling to keep rhino poaching in check - IOL|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) it experiences very few breaches these days. The last poachers captured in the reserve were apprehended carrying automatic weapons and received a collective 60-year jail sentence.&lt;ref name="blogs.abc.net.au"/&gt;

The IAPF operation comes under close and constant scrutiny from the Zimbabwean authorities, who focus on the hardline tactics associated with their training and operations. Mander maintains that whilst there is a shoot-on-sight policy for armed poachers in [[Zimbabwe]], the IAPF's training focuses strongly on the correct escalation in the use of force. This ensures using the minimum amount of force required to get the job done.&lt;ref name="contactairlandandsea.com"&gt;[http://www.contactairlandandsea.com/2009/Past_Editions/issue29/con29_africa.pdf Raw for Africa – Military skills applied in a new fight – Contact Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa the IAPF initiated the development of the Anti-Poaching Ranger qualification – the new national standard that aims to unify a fragmented industry.&lt;ref name="IAPF Website"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kruger2canyon.linmedia.co.za"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kruger2canyon.linmedia.co.za/details/19-10-2012/training_is_the_best_weapon_against_poaching/15394|title=Details|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many benefits come from standardising the training of anti-poaching rangers, such as the potential for joint operations, allowing rotation, providing a career path, and developing a national certificate for rangers who have long deserved recognition.&lt;ref name="kruger2canyon.linmedia.co.za"/&gt;

The training materials making up the "Anti-Poaching Ranger Qualification" are scheduled for completion in late 2014. The organisations assisting the IAPF in compiling the manuals have co-ownership of the material. The project will make training and training materials more readily available, and at a much higher industry standard. This project fills a void in the conservation industry, and has been backed by individuals including [[Ian Player|Dr Ian Player]], who is largely credited with saving the Southern White Rhinoceros from extinction, and Pelham Jones, Chairman of the Private Rhino Owners Association.&lt;ref name=ia/&gt;

In the South African Tourism Update Magazine article titled "A Spotlight on Poaching", the IAPF's Anti-Poaching Ranger Qualification was listed as one of four noteworthy initiatives initiated to protect our wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;http://tourismupdate.co.za/Contents//Editions/Feb14/Conservation_Feat.html South African Tourism Update Magazine "A Spotlight on Poaching", retrieved 13 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranger training==

When Mander was the Project Manager of the Iraq Special Training Academy in Baghdad and Dean was a senior instructor, they trained up to 700 paramilitary cadets at a time for redeployment. Using this experience, Mander and Dean set out to transform learning opportunities for rangers around the world by developing better education and training standards. The skills they learnt in [[Iraq]] were a start point for training in [[Zimbabwe]], and they set about providing it free of charge for rangers.&lt;ref name="voanews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/iraq-war-veteran-battles-rhino-poachers-in-africa-138338229/159563.html|title=Iraq War Veteran Battles Rhino Poachers in Africa|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This evolved towards developing national qualifications and a much more professional and structured approach in delivery.&lt;ref name="kruger2canyon.linmedia.co.za"/&gt;

The IAPF's rangers are taught such skills as ambush, patrolling, arrest, crime scene preservation,&lt;ref name="voanews.com"/&gt; and camouflage and concealment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarongekoski.com/pdf/36827862987088_africa geographic iapf.pdf On the front line – Africa Geographic Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the skills are an adaptation of military courses, adjusted to suit the environment in which they are required, and with a deep underlying conservation tone.&lt;ref name="IAPF Website"/&gt;&lt;ref name="contactairlandandsea.com"/&gt; During training courses, even convicted poachers have been rehabilitated and sent out to work as rangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victoriafalls-guide.net/dehorning-rhino-by-the-international-antipoaching-foundation.html|title=De-Horning Rhino by the International Anti-Poaching Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illegal trafficking of wildlife is one of the largest criminal industries in the world alongside drugs, weapons, and human trafficking. As continued and increasing pressure is placed on wilderness areas, the IAPF endeavours to increase the level of defence it provides, evolving to stay ahead of its adversaries.

The organisation has grown from being a localised problem-solver to becoming a solution-provider. The lack of availability of unmanned drones and of superior training packages are two major shortfalls for most conservationists. These shortfalls have the full attention of the IAPF.&lt;ref name=ia/&gt;

==Volunteers==

The IAPF is assisted by volunteers both on the ground and abroad. Termed the "Green Army," this growing group assists with day-to-day responsibilities.&lt;ref name=ia/&gt; When deployed in Africa with the IAPF, volunteers come face to face with the African Big Five whilst also assisting with teaching, patrolling, and monitoring of wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/dalby-man-works-save-rhinos-cameron-wheelehen/1205321/|title=Dalby man works to save rhinos|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology (UAVs)==
[[File:Damien Mander UAV Launching.jpg|thumb|[[Damien Mander]] launching a [[UAV]]]]
The IAPF's key members have accumulated significant amounts of time in modern wartime theatres such as [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], and have been exposed to evolving tactics and technology. Mander and Dean, having seen [[UAV]]s (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or drones) technology deployed in Iraq, were convinced of its place in conservation. Whilst initial enquiries were made into attaining UAVs as early as 2009, the IAPF UAV program did not commence officially until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/ex-soldier-takes-on-poachers-with-hi-tech-help-for-wildlife/story-e6frf7kx-1226541411880|title=Subscribe to the Herald Sun|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mander has remarked of the UAV program: "Having real-time intelligence greatly increases operational capabilities when reacting to poachers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nouse.co.uk/2013/01/22/license-to-kill/|title=License to Kill|first=Bella|last=Foxwell|date=22 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A UAV can cover in a few hours what a ground team will cover in a week."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-12-01/iraq-veteran-brings-the-fight-to-poachers/4402626|title=Iraq veteran brings the fight to poachers|date=1 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Conservationists must now be given the capacity to embrace the same technology that is made available to the military."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iapf.org/images/documents/mander_on_3aw.mp3 Damien Mander talks to 3AW Radio – 3AW Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2012, international media became aware of the IAPF's use of non-weaponized unmanned drones for conservation. Mander, along with IAPF's Technical Development Director Simon Beart (a former Royal Navy helicopter technician), started to regularly portray to the world the use of UAVs in conservation, and their thoughts on their future use.&lt;ref name=rise&gt;[http://www.iapf.org/images/documents/riseofthedronesjan2013.pdf Rise of the Drones – Africa Geographic Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124230/http://www.iapf.org/images/documents/riseofthedronesjan2013.pdf |date=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mander is quoted as asking, "Why could I have a UAV watching over me in Iraq, but these elephants here cannot have the same privilege?"&lt;ref name=rise/&gt;

Seeing articles appear in the media and hearing the call to arms, a number of Australians and South Africans came forward. A late-2012 Sydney UAV conference cemented a team of world-class standards.&lt;ref name=ia/&gt; The IAPF is moving towards the next phase of UAV operations, which consists of purchasing drones that are affordable, durable, and easy to operate from long range.&lt;ref name=ia/&gt;

Despite these plans, the IAPF is aware that many are pinning their hopes on the use of the unmanned drones as a "silver bullet" solution. Mander maintains a healthy degree of caution: "Drones are not the answer, they are a tool in the box. It is how we utilise these tools that will allow us to change the way we do things." An entire department within the IAPF has been developed to test and write the manuals for ground operations, utilising UAV technology.&lt;ref name=ia/&gt;

In addition to UAVs, the IAPF constantly explores new ways to modernise tactics and operations for anti-poaching.

The IAPF is often linked in the media and through its projects with rhino conservation. Mander has been quoted as saying, "The rhino is the hardest animal to protect. Poachers are willing to go to more lengths to kill a rhino than any other creature. If we aim to protect the rhino and succeed, we know that everything else in its ecosystem will be looked after."&lt;ref name="blogs.abc.net.au"/&gt;

Since 2008, rhino-poaching has increased significantly each year. A total of 633 rhinos were poached in South Africa alone in 2012. Rhinos are being hunted to extinction for their horns. As this animal, and thus its coveted body part, becomes increasingly rare, the market value increases, further aggravating the situation. Rhino horn has now become an ornamental object of status in Vietnam, where it has attained a street value of US$75,000 per kilogram.&lt;ref name="beat.com.au"/&gt; In other examples of Vietnam's desire for status-driven products, when the market has been saturated by these products, their price has dropped precipitously, resulting in plummeting demand. This strategy could work to reduce rhino poaching, given the current stockpiles of their horns (in South Africa there are 40 tons and in Zimbabwe five tons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/opinion/damned-if-you-do-and-1.1330912|title=Damned if you do, and - IOL|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mander and Dean have journeyed to [[Vietnam]] in order to understand the illegal wildlife trade from the Asian perspective, so that they could make up their own minds as to whether a legalised trade in rhino horn could be a solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nouse.co.uk/2013/01/22/license-to-kill/|title=License to Kill|first=Bella|last=Foxwell|date=22 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to understand the mindset of the consumer, Mander has made this observation: "I can't help but wonder whether, if my young son or daughter was dying, I myself wouldn't travel to the ends of the earth and beyond to try to save them, or at least give hope. When life is on the line, where do we stop?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/opinion/hanoi-where-having-horn-is-status-related-1.1330861#.URdWarTrblI|title=Hanoi – where having horn is status related - IOL|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mander's report on the journey, titled "Damned if you do and damned if you don't: legalizing the rhino horn trade," was widely published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/134/1340580232.pdf Damned if you do &amp; Damned if you don’t – Legalising the rhino horn trade – Rhino Resource Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Double jeopardy – Wildlife Ranching Magazine, South Africa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iapf.org/images/documents/hola3536donatellaknecht.pdf Donatella Knecht de Massy y su marido, Sebastien, en su mansión de Mónaco – Hello Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; It attracted the attention of such luminaries as world-renowned rhino conservationist [[Ian Player|Dr. Ian Player]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Damien Mander is an extraordinary man who was in the Special Forces in the Australian Army, and served in Iraq. He became interested in the rhino and came out to Zimbabwe where he has been working under the most difficult conditions. I think his report is outstanding, and certainly leaves no doubt in one's mind about the demand for rhino horn and the need for some clear thinking on the whole subject. My own view remains the same which is the position of the Wilderness Foundation and that there should be limited regulated trade in the horns that have been gathered through natural mortality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the release of that article, the IAPF joined the debate between conservation groups calling for a review of the 1976 CITES ban, outlawing a trade in rhino horn. Mander's point of view is that Asians cannot be re-educated away from a 2,500-year-old philosophy of traditional medicine, and one would be arrogant to think so. The situation is worsening, and conservationists working on the ground in Africa need logical solutions. "At present, the only proposal on the table that make a rhino worth more alive than dead is a legal trade in rhino horn," Mander is quoted as saying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.702.co.za/onair/heardonair.asp?action=mainsearch The war against poachers – 702 Talk Radio, South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation continues to deteriorate. New solutions are needed. Many fear that the worst is still to come and trends certainly indicate this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theweekendpost.com/2012/02/12/military-edge-to-anti-poaching-war/ Military edge to anti-poaching war] ''The Weekend Post''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/slaughter-of-rhinos-at-record-high-7687511.html Slaughter of rhinos at record high] ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chizarira National Park==

In 2010, the IAPF began negotiations with the [[Zimbabwe]] government to start work in [[Chizarira National Park]], the country's fourth largest (1,910 km2) and most ecologically diverse national park.&lt;ref name=ia/&gt; Approval to complete the feasibility study to resurrect the park was finally granted in 2011, and the study was completed in May 2012. The document outlines the enormous amount of work ahead—the result of over 20 years of neglect due to the financial hardships faced by the Parks and Wildlife Management Authority. Despite the neglect, Chizarira is described as an enchanting place, lost in time and still remaining as one of Southern Africa's most spectacular protected areas.&lt;ref name=ia/&gt; In anticipation of the project, Chizarira Lodge was donated to the IAPF to use as a headquarters, training facility and base for researchers.

==School education==

The IAPF's Schools Committee in Australia has made inroads at the grassroots level. The secondary school geography curriculum teaches Australian children about poaching and the Africa savannah, and uses the rhino as a metaphor for Mother Nature and for the struggle we are facing environmentally as a global community.

The '''International Union of Notaries''' (UINL) is a non-governmental organisation. It aims to promote, co-ordinate and develop the function and activities of notaries throughout the [http://www.uinl.org/mission world].

== Aims ==

* Promote and apply the fundamental principles of the civil law notarial system and the principles of notarial deontology;
* Represent the notariat at and co-operate with international organisations;
* Collaborate with national bodies and institutional authorities in every country;
* Study law in the field of notarial activities and co-operate to harmonise national legislations at international level;
* Promote, organise and develop vocational training and support scientific works in the notarial field;
* Study and systematically gather legislation on the civil law notarial institution;
* Promote international congresses, conferences and meetings.

== History and Bodies ==
Formed by 19 countries at the time of its establishment in 1948, the organisation includes 87 countries as of August 2018, of which 22 out of the 28 member countries of the European Union and 15 out of the 19 countries of the G20, thus showing the expansion of the European legal system. Today it is in place in almost 120 countries, totalling 2/3 of the world population and accounting for over 60% of world Gross Domestic Product.

Directed by a steering committee formed by 28 councillors, the decision-making body is the General Meeting of member notariats where each country has one vote regardless of its importance. It also includes a General Council formed by 172 members and continental and intercontinental commissions working from the scientific (vocational training and research), strategic (development), economic (networks and activities) and sociological (human rights and social protection) standpoints.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6455">The '''Inventory of Conflict and Environment''' (ICE) is a project initiated by Jim Lee, [[School of International Service]] (SIS) at [[American University]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Inventory of Conflict and Environment (ICE), [http://www1.american.edu/TED/about.htm  Mandala projects]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written extensively on environment and conflict, including the book "Hot and Cold Wars".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/459789656|title=Climate change and armed conflict : hot and cold wars|last=James R.|first=Lee|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9780415778695|location=|pages=|oclc=459789656}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ICE project makes use of case research and computer applications in international relations research.&lt;ref&gt;Franzel, Joshua ''et al.'' [http://www.innovation.cc/scholarly-style/franzel3lee.pdf  "Inventory Building and Utilization with Information Technologies: The Use of Database and Pattern Matching Systems in Teaching and Research,"] ''The Innovation Journal: The Public Sector Innovation Journal,'' Vol. 11, No. 3, p. 2. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cases can be searched through a pattern matching tool.&lt;ref&gt;Franzel, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  ICE establishes a perspective in which disaggregated data is combined with geographic information in the study of conflicts.

ICE Case studies are sets of categorical research projects meant to spur further research in specific areas of international dispute.&lt;ref&gt;ICE, [http://www1.american.edu/TED/ice/iceall.htm   Case studies]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ICE cases are related to the [http://mandalaprojects.com/wordpress/ Trade and Environment Database project] (TED).&lt;ref&gt;Trade and Environment Database (TED), [http://www1.american.edu/TED/ted.htm  project overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1991, the TED and ICE projects have produced over a range of case study projects.  ICE has about 300 cases.  Among the practical uses of such case studies, ICE provides information on environmental refugees, conflict dimensions, countries involved and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;Akashah, Mey. [http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/May-June%202010/bytes-full.html  "Bytes of Note: The Fight and Flight of Environmental Change,"] ''Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development.'' May–June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  ICE case studies have been of interest in both research and policy arenas.  The ICE cases can be found [http://mandalaprojects.com/wordpress/index.php/ice-cases/ HERE].

Conflict and environment are modern and age-old problems and the cases represent this continuum of impact.  The history of conflict and environment dates back many thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/brief-history-of-climate-change-and-conflict|title=A Brief History of Climate Change and Conflict, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|last=James|first=Lee|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AT the root of these cases are control over resources and migrations of peoples.  These two drivers will remain at the core of environmental conflict cases, now and in the future.

==ICE Cases and the ICE Search Engine==
ICE project is an evolving search engine and a tool for looking at international conflicts in the context of events and in contexts of similar and/or different typologies. It is also a tool for scenario creation for analyzing new cases.&lt;ref&gt;School of International Service (SIS), [http://www.mandalaprojects.com/ice/ice-cases/ice_index.html  ICE Search and Scenario Builder].&lt;/ref&gt;  Several researchers, students  and universities have been part of the ICE project.  It is the product of melding together approaches to the separate fields of environment and conflict studies. 

The ICE system identifies the elements of conflict as aspects of a parsed scenario.  Using ICE, an evaluation of any specific event or series of events facilitates consideration of an array of factors.&lt;ref&gt;SIS, [http://win14.american.edu/ice/search_ice.cfm#using How to Use and Interpret the Scores and Rankings]&lt;/ref&gt;  These factors include several types of information, including general, environmental, conflict, and decisions.  These are represented by a series of indicators grouped into basket of categories.  These factors are also searchable items on the search engine.

The "inferential" ICE search engine offers a pattern matching system and an additional weighting component for the researcher's evaluation and analysis.  The [https://icedb.shinyapps.io/icedb/ Ice Search and Create Scenario Tool]  is an upgraded version with more user options.&lt;ref&gt;Franzel, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The SST lets the user imagine new cases, input relevant attributes and see how it compares to other ICE cases.  These scenarios come with a simple automated case analysis and can be saved or results downloaded.

'''''Isolezwe''''' is a [[Zulu-language]] [[newspaper]] launched in 2002 by [[Independent News &amp; Media]]. It is published daily in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]], in the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format. Editor Thulani Mbathi describes their target market as "the modernising Zulu ... [s]omeone who may go back home to the rural areas to slaughter a cow to amadlozi [the ancestors], but is as equally comfortable taking his family out for dinner and a movie in a shopping mall".&lt;ref name="MG"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2007-05-28-the-all-new-zulu|periodical=Mail and Guardian|date=2007-05-28|title=The all new Zulu|last=Tolsi|first=Niren|accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mediaupdate&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Update (Isolezwe conquers the streets)|url=http://www.mediaupdate.co.za/?IDStory=18156|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
In June 2004, ''Isolezwe'' launched their online edition; their fellow Independent News &amp; Media publications described it as the first Zulu-language news website.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=31&amp;art_id=iol1087809565896Z400|periodical=Independent Online|title=Zulu goes online with Isolezwe website|date=2004-06-21|accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=2004-06-30|periodical=The Mercury|url=http://www.themercury.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=283&amp;fArticleId=2132750|last=Khan|first=Farook|title=Isolezwe launches into cyberspace|accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the five years after its founding, it performed much better than Independent's English-language South African dailies, growing from a circulation of under 30,000 to more than 95,000, according to [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (UK)|Audit Bureau of Circulations]] figures.&lt;ref name="MG"/&gt; Much of their circulation consists of single-copy sales rather than subscriptions. It continued its strong performance in the first quarter of 2010, with a 34% increase in circulation to 104,481, as compared to industry-wide 2.3% drop in sales. Circulation for their Sunday edition, ''[[Isolezwe ngeSonto]]'', also reached 71,219. Paper insiders disagreed on the reasons for the growth; editor-in-chief Mbathi credited [[human interest story|human-interest stories]] and local news, while joint managing director Brian Porter mentioned editorial content and sports as "vital ingredients".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/business/article545837.ece/Zulu-papers-lead-SA-sales|title=Zulu papers lead SA sales|date=2010-07-12|accessdate=2010-08-26|periodical=Times Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
''Isozwele'' is known for using a more urban form of Zulu, in contrast to its competitor ''Ilanga'', which describes itself as using a "purer form" of the language.

The '''Kwijau''' or '''Kuijau''' are an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[ethnic group]] residing in [[Sabah]], eastern [[Malaysia]] on the island of [[Borneo]].

They are known for performing the ''Magunatip'', an east Malaysian dance very strongly influenced by the [[Philippine]] [[tinikling]] .Performed by the young men and women, the dance involves jumping steps that manoeuvre the dancer's feet in and out, so as not to get their feet trapped by 2 moving [[bamboo]] poles that are held by another pair of dancers, who beat the poles together and over a shorter length of wood or bamboo, creating an interesting rhythm.

'''Los 40''' ('''The 40''', stylized as '''LOS40''' and formerly ''Los 40 Principales'', {{lang-es|Los-cuarenta}}) is a [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40]] musical radio network and radio station brand in many Spanish-speaking countries from [[PRISA#Music_and_radio|Prisa Radio]]. The station has its origins as a music show at Radio Madrid, today [[Cadena SER]] in 1966, where the 40 Principales chart was born, then evolved into a spin-off radio station in 1979. The brand’s network in Spain has 3,000,000 listeners alone.

Some stations under this brand name are owned and operated or are licensed by [[Grupo PRISA]] to use the brand. Some LOS40 stations are operated by a local broadcasting company and affiliated with the company that holds a license to use the brand from Grupo PRISA. Each LOS40 network typically broadcasts its own national feed from its respective country.

LOS40 stations broadcast in:
*[[Argentina]]
*[[Chile]]
*[[Colombia]]
*[[Costa Rica]]
*[[Dominican Republic]]
*[[Ecuador]]
*[[Guatemala]]
*[[Mexico]] (franchised to [[Televisa Radio]] and aired by many [[Grupo Radiorama|Radiorama]] stations)
*[[Panama]]
*[[Nicaragua]]
*[[Paraguay]]
*[[Puerto Rico]]
*[[Spain]]

Most LOS40 networks generally air Spanish and English contemporary hit music that mostly includes American, Latin American, Pan-European and British singers and bands. Most stations emphasize [[Latin Pop|Latin Top 40]] music; however Mexico, Panama and Dominican stations feature more European and English-language music whilst Chile and Costa Rica stations plays more [[reggaeton]] and [[Bachata (music)|bachata]]. It has a high-rotation playlist consisting mainly of tracks from its private chart. The main music genres that can be heard are pop, [[pop-rock]] and some [[dance music]] from the '90s, '00s and present day.

== History ==
In 1965, the Ministry of Information and Tourism passed a law forcing medium wave radio stations to launch FM stations to develop FM in Spain. Due to the high costs of producing new shows, most of the schedule for the new stations was based on music, mainly classical music. In 1966, [[Cadena SER]] asked one of its broadcasters, Rafael Revert, to develop a new music show aimed at a younger audience. So he took the idea of the [[Top 40]] and created a chart with the 40 top singles of the week, which would be voted on by the audience. So, on July the 18th, 1966, the first show of '''''Los 40 Principales''''' was broadcast on [[Radio Madrid]], marking the debut of the chart list, with ''[[Monday Monday]]'' by [[the Mamas &amp; the Papas]] as the first number 1 on the list.

Soon, the show would be broadcast on ten [[Cadena SER]] radio stations. At first it was a daily show, revealing candidates during the week, and the new list each Saturday. The viewers would phone each station to vote for their favorite songs. The show was recorded in Madrid, then the tape was sent to all of the affiliate stations throughout Spain and broadcast simultaneously. The duration of the show was increased during the 70s from the original 1 hour to 2, 4 and finally 8 hours by the end of the 1970s. In 1979, Cadena SER decided to create new 40 Principales stations, which would be dedicated to the chart and its candidates 24 hours a day. At first, the 40 Principales stations were still part of Cadena SER, becoming an independent network in 1987, though still owned by [[Grupo PRISA]] alongside Cadena SER. In 1985, the 40 Principales main station began broadcasting live by satellite throughout Spain.

In 1990, the chart show started being broadcast also on TV through [[Canal+ 1|Canal+]], and in 1998 also on the newly created 40 Principales TV satellite channel. The chart show got its present name, ''Del 40 al 1'' (''From 40 to 1''), in 1995. During the 2000s, 40 Principales was expanded through Latin American opening several stations in Spanish speaking countries with either local media companies operating stations within a country or listening area or Grupo Prisa operating a company within a country.

In May 2016, Los 40 Principales re-branded as simply LOS40. The main reason was that the station "is so much more than a top 40 list"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://corporatevision.io/corporate-vision-develops-strategic-roadmap-new-brand-vision-digital-transformation-for-global-music-radio-leader-los40/|title=Corporate Vision® develops new brand vision &amp; digital transformation for global music radio leader LOS40|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In September 2017, the LOS40 TV channel was shut down after almost two decades of broadcasting.

In December 2014, DJ Paul Hip asked listeners of 40 Principales Chile what they would do for free music concert festival tickets.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news |last=Barell|first=Ryan|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/12/22/rim-fm_n_6365022.html|title=Rimjob Live On Air Prompts Apology After Chilean Radio DJ Paul Hip's Competition Turns Weird|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|date=22 December 2014|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radio station hosted a competition for contestants to come up with their own challenges. If their challenge was accepted by the radio DJ, they were given the opportunity to complete it to win the tickets.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cullen|first=Clare|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/trending/outrage-as-woman-licks-whipped-cream-from-radio-presenters-bum-crack-live-on-air-to-win-concert-tickets-30859314.htmll|title=Outrage as woman licks whipped cream from radio presenters bum crack live on air to win concert tickets|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''|date=23 December 2014|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One female listener offered to do "actually anything, up to and including licking whipped cream out of a human anus" to win tickets to the Mysteryland EDM festival. Hip took the woman up on the proposal - in the middle of his show.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"/&gt; On 17 December 2014,&lt;ref name="buzzfeed"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/outrage-after-a-radio-dj-had-a-woman-give-him-a-rim-job-live#.eqlyb0qVp|title=Outrage After A Woman Gave A Radio DJ A Rim Job Live On The Air|work= |location= |publisher=''[[BuzzFeed]]''|date=19 December 2014|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; she completed the act live on air.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taringa"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.taringa.net/posts/noticias/18366249/Chilena-besa-trasero-de-locutor-de-radio-para-ganar-entradas.html|title=chilena besa trasero de locutor de radio para ganar entradas|work= |language=Spanish|location= |publisher=''[[Taringa!]]''|date=20 December 2014|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="larepublica"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://archivo.larepublica.pe/19-12-2014/youtube-chilena-besa-trasero-de-locutor-de-radio-para-ganar-entradas|title=YouTube: mujer besa trasero de locutor por ganar entradas para concierto y genera polémica - VIDEO|work= |language=Spanish|location= |publisher=''[[la Repubblica]]''|date=19 December 2014|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hip then proceeded to invite listeners of the radio station to kiss the woman&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite news |last=Payton|first=Matt|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/2014/12/21/radio-station-apologises-for-dj-getting-a-rimjob-live-on-air-4995304/|title=Radio station apologises for DJ having cream licked from his backside live on-air|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''|date=21 December 2014|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had just licked whipped cream from his anus to win tickets of their own.&lt;ref name="ibtimes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kinder|first=Tabatha|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/outrage-chilean-dj-receives-rim-job-listener-live-air-graphic-photo-1480391|title=Outrage as Chilean DJ receives 'rim job' from listener live on air|work= |location= |publisher=''[[International Business Times]]''|date=20 December 2014|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radio station's production team&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt; [[Twitter|tweeted]] an uncensored image of the act,&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; which went viral over Twitter and caused controversy,&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt; with Twitter followers&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; calling the act "misogynist and humiliating" and questioning the station's ethics and journalistic ethic. The radio station later issued an apology saying they were sorry if they had offended their audience and they probably should not have accepted such challenge, but assured it was completely "voluntary and even suggested by the participant" in a contest that was open to what ever each contestant wanted to do. The radio station deleted the tweet promptly after the negative reactions and assured their fans the contest's only purpose was to have fun, and not to hurt or demean anyone.&lt;ref name="latintimes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roterman|first=Natalie|url=http://www.latintimes.com/womans-gruesome-challenge-get-free-concert-tickets-causes-outrage-chile-284383|title=Woman's Gruesome Challenge To Get Free Concert Tickets Causes Outrage In Chile!|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Latin Times]]''|date=21 December 2014|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Burundi]]''' has issued [[postage stamp]]s for national use since achieving independence on 1 July 1962. The country was formerly a part of the Belgian territory of [[Ruanda-Urundi]] and before 1962 used those postage stamps.

==Independence==
For the first issue after independence, Burundi overprinted stamps of Ruanda-Urundi with '''Royaume du Burundi'''. Subsequent stamps were inscribed "Royaume du Burundi".&lt;ref name=sg&gt;''Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue: North East Africa''. London: [[Stanley Gibbons]], 2013, pp. 1-5. {{ISBN|9780852598764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Republic of Burundi ==
In 1966, following political turmoil, Burundi became a republic and from then the stamps were marked '''République du Burundi'''.&lt;ref name=sg/&gt;

There are two conditions on the partnership between the NSA and the partner country for making an agreement. The first one is that the partner countries will not use the NSA's technology to collect any data on U.S. citizens. The second one is that the NSA will not use the access it has been granted in the partner countries to collect data on the host countries' citizens.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although these conditions have exceptions, NSA doesn't state which those exceptions are. According to [[Edward Snowden]], these agreements between the NSA and its partner countries are vague and are easily circumvented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201403/20140307ATT80674/20140307ATT80674EN.pdf|title=Edward Snowden's testimony - European Parliament|last=|first=|date=7 March 2014|website=|page=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621195213/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201403/20140307ATT80674/20140307ATT80674EN.pdf|archive-date=21 June 2018|dead-url=|access-date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was publicly revealed in June 2014, by the Danish newspaper ''[[Dagbladet Information]]''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and by ''[[The Intercept]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Revelation of the program was based on as part of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|leaks by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden]].

According to a NSA's classified intelligence briefing in 2010,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; RAMPART-A was used across all NSA Analysis and Production lines, and in the previous year (2009), over 9000 intelligence reports were written based solely on the RAMPART-A data.

The program cost about $170 million between 2011 and 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;The program started in 1992.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[XKeyscore]] is implemented in the program's architecture.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1200865-uodds2overview-v1-1-redacted-information-dk.html|title=Special Source Operations (SSO) slides with details on RAMPART-A sites, collection and tasking|last=|first=|date=|website=|type=Classified Top Secret PDF-file. Part of the published files (see the articles from Dagbladet Information[https://www.information.dk/udland/2014/06/nsa-third-party-partners-tap-the-internet-backbone-in-global-surveillance-program] and The Intercept[https://theintercept.com/2014/06/18/nsa-surveillance-secret-cable-partners-revealed-rampart-a/]).|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313201540/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1200865-uodds2overview-v1-1-redacted-information-dk.html|archive-date=13 March 2016|dead-url=|access-date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partners ==
The partner countries are divided into two groups by their cooperation level, "Second" and "Third".&lt;ref name="Greenwald2014"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AvFzAgAAQBAJ|title=No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State|author=Glenn Greenwald|date=13 May 2014|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-1-62779-074-1|pages=104–105|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For the host partner country, U.S. provides processing and analysis tools and equipment, which means that the partner countries are able to use the NSA's tools for processing and analysing the data that flows in and out of their country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It's likely that not every partner country has RAMPART-A site(s); in 2013 NSA had set up at least 13 RAMPART-A sites, nine of which were in active state. Three of the largest sites, ''AZUREPHOENIX'', ''SPINNERET'' and ''MOONLIGHTPATH'' gathers traffic from some 70 different cables or networks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Signal Station Road''' is a road in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. It leads down from the top of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]],&lt;ref name="BrownBaskett2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Jules|last2=Baskett|first2=Simon|last3=Garvey|first3=Geoff|title=The Rough Guide to Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fjyv9lYSoGgC&amp;pg=PT627|accessdate=2 May 2013|date=1 April 2009|publisher=Rough Guides Limited|isbn=978-1-84836-837-8|page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; and skirts the [[Upper Rock Nature Reserve]].

==Description==
[[File:Gibraltar MOD warning signs.jpg|thumb|left|MOD multilingual warning signs on fencing along the road in [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Arabic languages|Arabic]], those being some of the main [[languages of Gibraltar]]]]

The road takes its name from an old [[Signal Hill Battery, Gibraltar|signal station]] built by the British on the clifftop. A footpath known as either Green's Lodge Road or Green's Lodge footpath leads out through a break in the (former) high-voltage fencing on one side of the road.

'''USA-84''', also known as '''GPS IIA-6''', '''GPS II-15''' and '''GPS SVN-27''', is an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which forms part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the sixth of nineteen [[GPS Block IIA|Block IIA]] GPS satellites to be launched.

USA-84 was launched at 08:57:00 UTC on 9 September 1992, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D214, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-84 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2a.htm|title=GPS-2A (Navstar-2A)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 1992, USA-84 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|19914|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20451|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.98 minutes, and 54.7 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had PRN 27, and operated in slot 4 of plane A of the GPS constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/navstar.htm|title=Navstar|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite has a mass of {{convert|1816|kg}}. It had a design life of 7.5 years,&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; but was in service for twenty years, until its retirement in October 2012.

{{Time zones of Africa}}
'''West Africa Time''', or '''WAT''', is a time zone used in west-central [[Africa]]; with countries west of [[Benin]] instead using [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT; equivalent to [[UTC±0|UTC with no offset]]). West Africa Time is one hour ahead of [[Coordinated Universal Time]] ([[UTC+01:00|UTC+01]]), which makes it the same as [[Central European Time]] (CET) during winter, or [[Western European Summer Time]] (WEST) and [[British Summer Time]] (BST) during the summer.

As most of this time zone is in the [[equator]]ial and [[tropics|tropical]] region, there is little change in day length throughout the year, so [[daylight saving time]] is not observed.

West Africa Time is used by the following countries:
*{{Flag|Algeria}} (as ''Central European Time'')
*{{Flag|Angola}}
*{{Flag|Benin}}
*{{Flag|Chad}}
*{{Flag|Cameroon}}
*{{Flag|Central African Republic}}
*{{Flag|Democratic Republic of the Congo}} (western side only)
*{{Flag|Equatorial Guinea}}
*{{Flag|Gabon}}
*{{Flag|Morocco}} (as ''Greenwich Mean Time + 1 hour'')
*{{Flag|Niger}}
*{{Flag|Nigeria}}
*{{Flag|Republic of the Congo}}
*{{Flag|São Tomé and Príncipe}}
*{{Flag|Tunisia}} (as ''Central European Time'')
