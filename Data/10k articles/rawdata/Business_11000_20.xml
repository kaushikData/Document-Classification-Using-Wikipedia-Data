In the United Kingdom, [[Association football|football]] clubs sometimes choose to enter [[Administration (law)|administration]] when they are unable to pay off outstanding [[debt]]s. Under the [[Insolvency Act 1986]], a business will face a winding-up order bringing them to court and if it is shown that a business cannot pay debts as they fall due or cannot repay outstanding debts then the company will be classified as [[UK insolvency law#Definition|insolvent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/123|title=Insolvency Act 1986 (c. 45) – Part IV Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts – Chapter VI Winding Up by the Court – Grounds and effect of winding-up petition|work=[[UK Statute Law Database]]|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Administration''' puts accountants "in charge of pretty much everything apart from coaching the players and picking the team".&lt;ref name="Administration"/&gt; For a football club in administration, the "football creditors rule" requires football-related debts such as wages owed to players and staff, and transfer fees owed to other clubs to be paid first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7741859.stm|title=Football clubs owe tax millions |last=Grant|first=Paul|date=23 November 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Wales==
In 2000, [[ITV Digital]] bought the broadcasting rights to [[The Football League|Football League]] and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] matches in a three-year, £315m deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-110973/Fears-soccer-clubs-ITV-Digital-sale.html|title=Fears for soccer clubs as ITV Digital is put up for sale|work=[[The Daily Mail]]|accessdate=14 March 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2002, the company went bankrupt owing the League £180&amp;nbsp;million which it said it "cannot afford to pay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1896732.stm|title=ITV Digital goes broke|date=27 March 2002|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this many Football League clubs had financial problems and entered administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1898021.stm|title=ITV Digital woes bring football crisis|date=28 March 2002|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/oct/22/newsstory.sport|title= Crisis clubs|date=22 October 2002|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 October 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the implementation of a points deduction it was perceived that clubs had "manipulated and abused [administration] as a way of shedding debts then restructuring, and borrowing again once the hapless creditors had been fobbed off with their 8p in the pound".&lt;ref name="Administration"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7305998.stm|title= Football administration|last=Farquhar|first=Gordon|date=20 March 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2003, it was proposed that clubs entering administration would be docked 10 points. A [[Fit and proper person test|'fit and proper persons' test]] was also introduced in an attempt to prevent fraudulent activities. If a person was previously director at a club which was in "administration twice during a five-year period" or at "two different clubs that have each gone into administration in a five-year period" then they would be prevented from becoming the controlling shareholder of a [[Football League]] club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5030910.stm|title= The murky world of football finances|last=Summers|first=Chris|date=28 June 2006|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 'fit and proper persons' test was also introduced for directors of [[Premier League]] clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/12/66/0,,12306~91666,00.pdf#page=17 |title=The F.A.

To ease financial problems for clubs that had been relegated, "parachute payments" were introduced to give time to adapt to the financial gulf between divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/points-threat-to-clubs-choosing-administration-580968.html|title=Points threat to clubs choosing administration|last=Warshaw|first=Andrew|date=24 September 2003|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=26 February 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100409015315/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/points-threat-to-clubs-choosing-administration-580968.html| archivedate= 9 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deductions of 10 points in the [[Football League]] and 9 points in the [[Premier League]] were ratified in 2004, with the rule in place from the start of the 2004–05 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://breaking.tcm.ie/archives/2004/0115/sport/chairmen-to-agree-points-deductions-129765.html|title=Chairmen to agree points deductions|date=15 January 2004|work=[[BreakingNews.ie]]|publisher=[[Thomas Crosbie Holdings]]|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PL"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jan/30/newsstory.sport14|title=Crisis clubs will lose nine points|last=Chaudhary|first=Vivek|date=20 January 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 October 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The League also adopted rules that prevented any side from being in administration for either two successive seasons or eighteen consecutive months.&lt;ref name="Wrexham"/&gt; The reason for the deduction being a point less in the Premier League was that the teams play eight fewer fixtures than Football League clubs.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt; The first club to incur this new penalty were [[League One]] side [[Wrexham F.C.]] who entered administration on 3 December 2004.&lt;ref name="Wrexham"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4064257.stm|title= Wrexham FC in administration|date=3 December 2004|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] filed for administration with only a few days remaining in the [[2006–07 Football League Championship|2006–07 season]], which automatically triggered a 10-point penalty. This placed Leeds at the bottom of the table and relegated the club, but they were extremely likely to have been relegated anyway. By entering administration during the 2006–07 season, they hoped to avoid starting the [[2007–08 Football League#League One|2007–08 season]] on −10 points. The following week, [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]] entered administration in the final minutes of a defeat to [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] which ensured they were relegated to the [[Football Conference]], meaning they likewise avoided starting the following season on -10 points (though they would find themselves being double-relegated to the Conference North for unrelated reasons).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/boston_united/6738469.stm Boston suffer new demotion blow]&lt;/ref&gt; The Football League saw both cases as clubs trying to exploit a loophole, and changed the rules. From 2007–08, any club entering administration after the fourth Thursday in March would have their 10-point deduction suspended until the following season. If the club is relegated the points will be deducted from their tally at the start of next season. If the club stays up the 10 points will be taken off their final total.
&lt;ref name="Loophole"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6736997.stm|title=League closes 10-point loophole |date=9 June 2007|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 2010, [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] became the first Premier League club to enter administration.&lt;ref name="Portsmouth"/&gt;

===Football creditors rule===
In a situation of insolvency, the "football creditors rule" means that debts to other clubs or players are prioritised and must be paid in full before the club is eligible to compete again in the league.&lt;ref name="Lawyer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Plainer|first=Adam|title=Paying by the rules|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/paying-by-the-rules/1003055.article|work=[[The Lawyer]]|accessdate=31 May 2010|date=11 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100512172003/http://www.thelawyer.com/paying-by-the-rules/1003055.article| archivedate= 12 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Enterprise Act 2002]] made reforms to the insolvency act and, from 15 September 2003, the altered procedures for administration were implemented.&lt;ref name="Ent02"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about the Enterprise Act: Company|url=http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/faq/faqeactc.htm|publisher=[[Insolvency Service|The Insolvency Service]]|accessdate=31 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505053545/http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/faq/faqeactc.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably it abolished the Crown's preferential right to recover unpaid taxes ahead of other creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enterprise Act changes to be introduced in June|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-3501|date=24 April 2003|work=[[OUT-LAW]]|accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) is now often not paid in full (between 2003 and 2010, outstanding unpaid taxes to the HMRC amounted to £30 million).&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Crunched creditors call time on living the dream|first=Dave|last=Conn|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2010/feb/10/portsmouth-cardiff-hmrc-winding-up|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 February 2010|accessdate=13 October 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legality of the football creditors rule was challenged in 2004 in ''[[Inland Revenue Commissioners v The Wimbledon Football Club Ltd]]''. However, it was found that "full payment to football creditors (out of third party funds) ahead of preferential creditors did not infringe the provisions of section s4(4)(a) of the Act" and "differential treatment may be necessary to secure the continuation of the company's business and may be regarded as supportable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Voluntary Arrangements |first=John |last=Verrill |url=http://www.dundas-wilson.com/publications/dw_cms_4894.pdf |publisher=[[Dundas &amp; Wilson]] |date=1 September 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002071144/http://www.dundas-wilson.com/publications/dw_cms_4894.pdf |archivedate=2 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 HMRC brought another challenge to the football creditors rule in the High Court, this time on the basis that it breached fundamental principles of insolvency law, including the [[pari passu]] rule that all unsecured creditors should be paid on a proportionate basis. However, in May 2012 the court rejected the challenge as it found that the rule was not a deliberate evasion of insolvency law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HM Revenue and Customs v The Football League Ltd [2012] EWHC 1372 (Ch)|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2012/1372.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] and [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] already in administration at the time, it was decided that if "they are not in the process of coming out of administration by 31 May", the deduction would be applied at the start of the following season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/3418773.stm|title=Dundee face point deduction|date=22 January 2004|publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Scottish Football Association]] would not allow clubs in administration to play in European competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/3415935.stm |title=Uefa blow for cash-strapped clubs |date=21 January 2004 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Motherwell and Dundee met the required conditions to avoid the deduction of points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/3749583.stm |title=Dundee rescue plan agreed |date=26 May 2004 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10 point penalty was subsequently applied to [[Gretna F.C.|Gretna]] in the 2007&amp;ndash;08 season&lt;ref name="Administration"/&gt; and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in 2011&amp;ndash;12.&lt;ref name = "simply the bust"/&gt;

Although the [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL) had no automatic deduction of points for clubs going into administration, it reserved the right to "deduct championship points before or during a season and/or to impose a player registration embargo on any club".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scottish Football League Handbook 2009–2010|publisher=[[Scottish Football League]]|pages=148|chapter=Constitution and Rules |url=http://www.scottishfootballleague.com/res/documents/SFL/SFLHandbook/SFL%20Constitution%20and%20Rules2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that its penalties for insolvency varied; [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] were docked 25 points in the 2010&amp;ndash;11 season because it was the second time they had entered administration in a relatively short period.&lt;ref name = "changes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/scottish-football/10365208/SPFL-clubs-that-go-into-administration-could-be-relegated.html |title=SPFL clubs that go into administration could be relegated |first=Ewing |last=Grahame |work=Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=9 October 2013 |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SFL also had the power to place a team in the bottom tier ([[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]]) if there were any doubts that the club could fulfill their fixtures for the forthcoming season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Livi relegated to Division Three |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/livingston/8179998.stm |publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=8 November 2011 |date=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[administration and liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc]] prompted much discussion in Scotland about what sanctions (if any) are appropriate for an insolvent club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17975013 |title=SPL board can't win over Rangers decision - Stephen Thompson |date=6 May 2012 |accessdate=18 December 2013 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Rangers entered administration in February 2012, the club was docked 10 points in the [[2011&amp;ndash;12 Scottish Premier League]]. The SPL clubs agreed to amend the penalty for administration to the greater of 10 points or one third of the club's tally in the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18263819 |title=SPL: Clubs set new financial fair play rules at Hampden meeting |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rangers attempted to agree a CVA with its creditors, but this offer was rejected by HMRC in June 2012.&lt;ref name = "liquidation"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18407309 |title=Rangers to re-form after creditors' deal is rejected |first1=Alasdair |last1=Lamont |first2=Chris |last2=McLaughlin |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=12 June 2012 |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business and assets of Rangers were instead sold to a new company.&lt;ref name = "liquidation"/&gt; One of Rangers' assets was its membership of the SPL, but this could not be transferred without the approval of the other SPL clubs.&lt;ref name = "liquidation"/&gt; Rangers' application for transfer was rejected by a 10&amp;ndash;1 majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18703183 |title=Rangers newco refused SPL entry after chairmen vote |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=4 July 2012 |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPL attempted to negotiate a deal with the SFL whereby Rangers would enter the First Division (second tier).&lt;ref name = "sfl3"/&gt; This was rejected by SFL clubs, who instead voted for Rangers to be granted associate membership of the SFL and a place in the Third Division (fourth tier).&lt;ref name = "sfl3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18813407 |title=Rangers: Charles Green accepts Division Three vote |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=13 July 2012 |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the SPL and SFL merged to form the [[Scottish Professional Football League]] (SPFL) in 2013, the penalty for entering administration was standardised as 15 points.&lt;ref name = "hearts"/&gt; [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] entered administration days before the leagues merged and were docked 15 points for the 2013&amp;ndash;14 season under the old SPL rules, as they had earned 44 points in the 2012&amp;ndash;13 season.&lt;ref name = "hearts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/clubs/hearts/229830-qa-what-will-happen-to-hearts-now-they-are-in-administration/ |title=Q&amp;A: What will happen to Hearts now they are in administration? |first=Grant |last=Russell |work=STV Sport |publisher=STV |date=19 June 2013 |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred Müller''' (from 1938 '''Miler'''; 1888 &amp;ndash; 1945) was [[Croatia]]n entrepreneur and oldest son of [[Adolf Müller (industrialist)|Adolf Müller]].&lt;ref name="žz"&gt;{{harvtxt|Snješka Knežević|2011|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Müller was born in [[Zagreb]] to a wealthy [[Jew]]ish family, with younger brother Leo.&lt;ref name="žz"/&gt; He graduated from higher technical school in [[Vienna]]. Müller was married to Klara ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Hafner) with whom he had two children, son Alan and daughter Evelina. After his father death, Müller inherited "Balkan" cinema and part of residential-commercial complex in Varšavska and Masarykova Street. In 1938, because of the political situation and [[antisemitism]] caused by [[Nazi propaganda]], Müller and his family converted to [[Catholicism]] and change their surname to Miler.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ognjen Kraus|1998|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Müller sold the residential-commercial complex in Varšavska and Masarykova Street to a Topić family from Zagreb. That same year Müller and his family moved to [[France]]. During [[World War II]], Müller and his wife where arrested by [[Gestapo]] in France with the help from [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]], while their daughter managed to save herself by hiding at friends. Müller son joined the [[French Resistance]]. In August 1944, Müller was deported to [[Dachau concentration camp]], where in January 1945 he was killed. Müller family survived the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], his wife and daughter moved to [[United States]] after the war, and in 1949 his son returned and stayed in Zagreb where he still lives. With the [[independence of Croatia]] in 1991, Müller son sought the return of the property which was taken from his father by [[Ustaše]] and later the communist of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="žz"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jl&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/m-llerovi---povijest-jedne-zagrebacke-obitelji/188361/ |title=Müllerovi - Povijest jedne zagrebačke obitelji |publisher=[[Jutarnji list]] |date=2008-04-20 |language=Croatian |archivedate=7 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307023630/http://www.jutarnji.hr/m-llerovi---povijest-jedne-zagrebacke-obitelji/188361/ |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zagrebonline.hr/darujemo-prvi-hrvatski-zvucni-film-lisinski/|title=Darujemo prvi hrvatski zvučni film "Lisinski"|publisher=www.zagreb.hr|date=2011-06-27|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allen Klein''' (December 18, 1931{{spaced ndash}} July 4, 2009) was an American businessman, music publisher, writers' representative and record label executive, most noted for his tough persona and aggressive negotiation tactics, many of which established higher industry standards for compensating recording artists. He founded [[ABKCO Records|ABKCO Music &amp; Records Incorporated]]. Klein revolutionized the income potential of recording artists, who previously had been routinely victimized by onerous record company contracts.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=xiii}} He first scored massive monetary and contractual windfalls for [[Buddy Knox]] and [[Jimmy Bowen]], one-hit rockabillies of the late 1950s, then parlayed his early successes into a position managing [[Sam Cooke]], and eventually managed [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]] simultaneously, along with many other artists, becoming one of the most powerful individuals in the music industry during his era.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=178}}

Rather than offering financial advice and maximizing his clients's income, as a business manager normally would, Klein set up what he called "buy/sell agreements" where a company that Klein owned became an intermediary between his client and the record label, owning the rights to the music, manufacturing the records, selling them to the record label, and paying royalties and cash advances to the client. Although Klein greatly increased his clients's incomes, he also enriched himself, sometimes without his clients's knowledge.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=133–35}} (The Rolling Stones's $1.25M advance from the Decca Records label in 1965, for one glaring example, was deposited into a company that Klein had established, and the fine print of the contract did not require Klein to release it for 20 years.){{sfn|McMillian|2013|p=199}} Klein's involvement with both the Beatles and Rolling Stones would lead to years of litigation and, specifically for the Rolling Stones, accusations from the group that Klein had withheld royalty payments, stolen the publishing rights to their songs, and neglected to pay their taxes for five years; this last had necessitated their French "exile" in 1971.{{sfn|McMillian|2013|pp=199–223}}

After years of pursuit by the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], Klein was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of making a false statement on his 1972 tax return, for which he spent two months of 1980 in jail.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=252–53}}

==Early life==
Klein was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], the fourth child and only son of Jewish immigrants.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=2}} His mother died of cancer very soon afterward, and Klein lived for a time with his grandparents,{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=3}} then subsequently in a Jewish [[orphanage]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=4}} until his father remarried shortly before Klein's 10th birthday.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=6}} In early work experience with a magazine and newspaper distribution company he showed an astounding facility with numbers, and learned alarming lessons about how profits were often systematically concealed from those who deserved them. Eventually he would realize that much the same situation existed in popular music, where labels routinely took much profit from the transitory careers of the artists who created the profit-generating music, and gave precious little back.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=9}}

Klein enlisted in the US Army in 1951 where he served as a clerk typist on [[Governors Island]], New York.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=9-10}} After military service, and with the assistance of the [[G.I. Bill]], Klein majored in accounting at [[Upsala College]], graduating in June 1957,{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=12}} and was hired by a Manhattan accounting firm, Joseph Fenton and Company.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=15}} He was assigned to assist Joe Fenton in an audit of a music publishers' organization, the [[Harry Fox Agency]], and several record companies, including [[Dot Records]], [[Liberty Records]], and [[Monarch Records]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=16}} In an early setback to Klein's career, he was fired by Joseph Fenton and Company after four months because of chronic lateness. The company wrote to the [[State of New Jersey]] urging officials not to approve him as a [[Certified Public Accountant]], and Klein chose not to take the examination.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=18}} He briefly attended law school but soon dropped out.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=19}}

Aided by his friendship with music publisher [[Don Kirshner]], a fellow alumnus of Upsala College,{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=17,19}} Klein worked as an accountant for the next several years, assisted by Henry Newfield, a CPA who was a friend from school and the Army, and Marty Weinberg, another CPA, under the name [[Allen Klein and Company]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=21}} Klein's clients included [[Ersel Hickey]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=19}} [[Dimitri Tiomkin]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=22}} [[Steve Lawrence]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=22}} [[Eydie Gormé]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=22}} [[Buddy Knox]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=22}} [[Jimmy Bowen]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=22}} [[Lloyd Price]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=25}} [[Neil Sedaka]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=27}} [[Bobby Darin]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=28–29}} [[Bobby Vinton]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=29}} [[Scepter Records]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=27}} and the estate of [[Mike Todd]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=27}} A key early contact was attorney Marty Machat, who frequently performed legal work for Klein over the years.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=21–24}}

In June 1958 Klein married Betty Rosenblum, a [[Hunter College]] student seven years his junior.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=14,19}} The couple had three children: Robin, Jody, and Beth.&lt;ref name="Laing"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/06/obituary-allen-klein | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | title=Allen Klein: US business manager who made sure the Rolling Stones and the Beatles got paid | first=Dave | last=Laing | date=July 5, 2009 | accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein acquired a reputation as a tough negotiator who could bring money to his clients. Two of them, [[rockabilly]] singers Knox and Bowen, were owed royalties by [[Roulette Records]]. [[Morris Levy]], co-owner of Roulette, feared because of his [[organized crime]] connections, was known to pay artists as little as possible. Klein persuaded him to pay Knox and Bowen the royalties they were owed over a four-year period. Klein's success with the Knox and Bowen negotiation brought him new clients, and he and Levy became lifelong friends.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=22-24}}&lt;ref name=Laing /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perrone/Independent" /&gt;

==Sam Cooke==
In 1963, Klein began a business partnership with [[Jocko Henderson]], an urbane black disc jockey who had daily radio shows in both [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City|New York]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=34}} Henderson hosted lavish, profitable live rhythm and blues shows at the [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem]], and formed a partnership with Klein to begin doing the same in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=35–36}} As Henderson's partner, Klein was introduced to [[Sam Cooke]], a preeminent talent who was equally adept at writing, producing, and performing his numerous hit records.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=38}} Cooke had scored four top ten hits between 1957 and 1963, including his number one hit, "[[You Send Me]],"{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=37}} among 33 records in the top 100 in that period. Although Cooke was clearly making his label, [[RCA Records]], a great deal of money, label executives nonetheless repeatedly refused to honor his many requests for a review of his accounts.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=39}} Klein forced the reluctant label to open its books for a thorough audit. Shortly afterward, RCA agreed to re-negotiate Cooke's contract.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=40–42}}

Klein secured for his client a genuinely groundbreaking deal. Klein created a holding company, [[Tracey Ltd.]], which was owned by Klein and named after one of Cooke's daughters. Tracey would manufacture Cooke's recordings and give exclusive rights to RCA to sell them for 30 years, after which the rights would revert to Tracey. Cooke would receive a cash advance of $100,000 per year for three years, followed by $75,000 for each of two option years. Instead of being paid the first $100,000 in cash, Cooke was paid in Tracey preferred stock, which would be taxed only when he sold it.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=44-46}} While the deal benefited Cooke, it also greatly benefited Klein, who ended up owning the rights to all of Cooke's recordings made since the contract re-negotiation when Cooke was killed in 1964 and his widow sold Cooke's remaining rights to Klein.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=57-58}}

Klein's successful negotiations on behalf of Cooke brought him new clients, including [[Bobby Vinton]]{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=47}} and [[the Dave Clark Five]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=48}} As with Cooke, Klein arranged for his clients to be paid over a period of time to reduce their tax liability. This also benefited Klein, who took advantage of the [[time value of money|earning potential of money over time]] to "make money from the money."{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=49}}

==Mickie Most and the British Invasion==
In 1964 Klein became the American business manager of [[Mickie Most]], a former singer who was the savvy producer of hits for [[the Animals]] and for [[Herman's Hermits]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=69}} Klein extended to Most a million-dollar promise, adding that if he failed to deliver in only one month, Most owed him nothing.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=71}} Klein did deliver, through strategic re-negotiations of existing contracts and new producing opportunities for RCA, including offers for Most to produce for both Sam Cooke and [[Elvis Presley]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=76}} Though the latter two prospects did not materialize, Most was suddenly one of the most talked-about and financially gratified figures in the English recording industry, and Klein was a step closer to eventual agreements with both [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=80}}

His victories for Most won Klein access to several key English musicians. He eventually negotiated vastly improved deals for the Animals,{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=120,134}} [[Herman's Hermits]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=120,134}} [[the Kinks]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=112–113}} [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=69, 245}} [[Donovan]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=112,119}} and [[Pete Townshend]] of [[the Who]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=248}} However, Klein's help came at a price. To shelter his clients's money from Britain's high taxation rate on income earned abroad, Klein held the money for them at the [[Chemical Bank]] in [[New York City]] and paid it to them over periods of time of up to 20 years. Klein invested this money, which earned far more than what Klein was obligated to pay to his clients, and he kept the difference in the accounts, thereby maintaining control over the money.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=121–122}}

==The Rolling Stones==

In the spring of 1965 [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], co-manager of [[the Rolling Stones]], saw in Klein a terrific business adviser and ally, one who could help him win an incipient power struggle with [[The Rolling Stones#Early history|Eric Easton]], a music business veteran who was then the other half of the band's management team.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=77,80}} Barely 21, Oldham was profoundly important in the development of the Stones' image, and in initiating the songwriting partnership of [[Keith Richards]] and [[Mick Jagger]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=77,90-96}}{{sfn|Rej|2006|pp=298–300}} After some management mishaps, blame for which fell at Easton's feet, and Jagger's ascension in the band's hierarchy following "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]", the Stones' first number one record in America, Oldham sought and received Jagger's blessing to bring Klein aboard for re-negotiation of the group's contract with [[Decca Records]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=96-106}} The label offered the band the opportunity to make $300,000 if their records continued to sell. Klein countered with, and quickly secured, an arrangement paying the Stones twice as much, in the form of an advance. He also forced [[London Records]], Decca's American subsidiary, to sign a separate contract. It too was for $600,000. By the time Klein subsequently re-negotiated the deal one year later, Easton having been removed as co-manager, the Stones were guaranteed $2.6&amp;nbsp;million—more than [[the Beatles]] were making.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=107-108}}

When Klein examined the Stones' management contract with Easton and Oldham he found that the latter were receiving a disproportionate share of the group's income: not only did Easton and Oldham receive an 8 percent royalty on sales of the Stones' singles—the Stones themselves only received 6 percent—but they also received a 25 percent commission on the Stones' income. At Klein's insistence, Oldham increased the Stones' royalties to 7 percent and relinquished his commission.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=90,108}}{{sfn|Rej|2006|p=298}} Klein offered the Stones a million-dollar minimum guarantee, paid over a 20-year period to reduce the Stones' tax liability, to let him become their music publisher, based on his faith in the Jagger-Richards songwriting team. He also arranged for a level of tour support and publicity far above anything the band had ever previously experienced for [[The Rolling Stones 1st American Tour 1965|the Stones' 1965 American tour]] in support of the album ''[[December's Children (And Everybody's)|December's Children]]''.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=108-111}}

Jagger, who had studied at [[the London School of Economics]],{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=89}} gradually became distrustful of Klein, particularly for the latter's ability to insert himself as a profit participant in the group's ever-growing financial picture. For example, in 1968 Klein very profitably bought out Oldham's share in the band for $750,000.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=121-122,144-145,150-151}}&lt;ref name="Sisario"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/arts/music/05klein.html?hp |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | title=Allen Klein, 77, Dies; Managed Music Legends | first=Ben | last=Sisario | date=July 5, 2009 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{sfn|Perrone|2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingtimes.org/articles/Who-What-is-Nanker-Phelge/ |title=Who/What Is Nanker Phelge? |last=Todd |first=Patrick |date=August 11, 2010 |publisher=rollingtimes.org |access-date=January 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171002/http://www.rollingtimes.org/articles/Who-What-is-Nanker-Phelge/ |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1968 the Stones were so concerned with how their finances were being handled by Klein that they hired a London law firm, Berger Oliver &amp; Co, to look into their financial situation and Jagger hired the titled merchant banker [[Prince Rupert Loewenstein]] to be his personal financial adviser.{{sfn|McMillian|2013|p=202}} Another possible factor in the Stones' dissatisfaction with Klein was that when the latter began to manage the Beatles he focused more of his attention on that band's affairs than on the concerns of the Stones. In 1970, on the occasion of needing to negotiate a new contract with Decca, Jagger announced that Klein would be replaced as manager by Loewenstein.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=148-149,197-203}}

The split between Klein and the Stones led to years of litigation. In 1971 the Stones sued Klein over U.S. publishing rights. The suit was settled the following year, with the Stones receiving $1.2&amp;nbsp;million as a settlement of all American royalties earned up to that point (and was essentially the $1.25M advance that Decca had paid the Stones in 1965 that Klein had been withholding since August 1965).{{sfn|McMillian|2013|p=199}} However, the Stones were unable to break their contract with Klein, who held an additional $2&amp;nbsp;million of the Stones' money to be paid over a 15-year period, ostensibly for tax purposes. Klein's company, [[ABKCO Records|ABKCO]], continued to control the rights to publish the Stones' music{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=230-231}} and it was Klein who made a fortune off the band's all-time best-selling album, ''[[Hot Rocks 1964–1971]]''.{{sfn|McMillian|2013|p=199}} In 1972 Klein alleged that some of the songs on their album ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'' had been composed while the Stones were still under contract with ABKCO. As a result, ABKCO acquired ownership of the disputed songs and was able to publish another Rolling Stones album, ''[[More Hot Rocks|More Hot Rocks (Big Hits and Fazed Cookies)]]''.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=235-236}} In 1974 negotiations over royalties led to a payment of $375,000 to the Stones and ABKCO's release of an additional Rolling Stones album, ''[[Metamorphosis (The Rolling Stones album)|Metamorphosis]]''.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=243}} In 1975 more lawsuits and negotiations resulted in a $1M payment to the Stones for non-payment by Klein of songwriting royalties, and the release of four Rolling Stones albums including ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus (album)|Rock and Roll Circus]]'' and ''[[Rolled Gold: The Very Best of the Rolling Stones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=News staff|title=Stones Settle With Allen Klein: Four More Albums|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 5, 1975|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/stones-settle-with-allen-klein-four-more-albums-19750605 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203105616/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/stones-settle-with-allen-klein-four-more-albums-19750605 |archivedate=February 3, 2013|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 Jagger and Richards sued to break their publishing agreement with ABKCO because of non-payment of royalties. The judge encouraged the two sides to reach a settlement.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=261-262}}

Starting in 1986, when the introduction of [[compact disc]]s brought great profits to the music industry, relations began to improve between Klein and the Stones.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=261}} In 2002 the Stones' album ''[[Forty Licks]]'' and the [[Licks Tour]], celebrating the band's 40th anniversary, incorporated songs owned by ABKCO. The Stones agreed to a five-year payment plan suggested by Klein's son, Jody.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=272}} In 2003 Klein negotiated with [[Steve Jobs]] to make ABKCO's Rolling Stones songs available on [[iTunes]].

==Cameo-Parkway and ABKCO==
In February 1967, with an eye toward producing films and finding a way to invest his clients' money, Klein attempted to acquire [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. His hopes were blunted when [[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.]], heir to the [[Seagram]] fortune, instead took control of the firm.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=123-127}} Klein then turned his attention to [[Cameo-Parkway Records]], a Philadelphia-born, Los Angeles-based label which had enjoyed hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s, thanks to [[Chubby Checker]], [[Bobby Rydell]], [[Dee Dee Sharp]] and others, but which by 1967 was no longer prospering. It was one of the first publicly traded record companies, making it ideal for a financial maneuver Klein had in mind, known as a reverse acquisition. It was meant to take Allen Klein and Company public via its being acquired on paper by Cameo-Parkway. By July 1967, Klein and his associate Abbey Butler had acquired a controlling interest and filed to rename Cameo-Parkway as [[ABKCO Records|ABKCO]], which is an acronym for "The '''''A'''''llen and '''''B'''''etty '''''K'''''lein '''''Co'''''mpany." Fueled by speculation, the stock price increased from $1.75 a share in July&amp;nbsp;1967 to a peak of 76⅜ in February&amp;nbsp;1968 before the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] halted trading. The [[NYSE MKT|American Stock Exchange]] declined to reinstate the stock; instead, ABKCO continued to trade over the counter, and the stock price dropped to more realistic levels. In 1987, Klein made ABKCO a privately held company.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=128-133}}

==The Beatles==

In 1964 Klein approached [[the Beatles]]' manager, [[Brian Epstein]], with an offer for the Beatles to sign with [[RCA]] for $2&amp;nbsp;million but Epstein wasn't interested, saying that he was loyal to [[EMI]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=62}} After Epstein died in August 1967, in January 1968 the group formed [[Apple Corps]], which they announced in May 1968.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=268–70, 287}}{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=154–55}} They hoped it would provide the means for correcting Epstein's unfortunate business decisions, which had both limited their incomes and ensured high tax burdens. Although "[[Hey Jude]]", the Beatles' first Apple release, was an enormous success, the label itself was a money pit, with little accountability for how money was being spent.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=324}}{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=156–57}}

Klein contacted [[John Lennon]] after reading his press comment that the Beatles would be "broke in six months" if things continued as they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/celebrity-obituaries/5751356/Allen-Klein.html |author=Staff writer|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Allen Klein|date=July 5, 2009|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January&amp;nbsp;26, 1969, he met with Lennon, who retained Klein as his financial representative, and the next day met with the other Beatles. [[Paul McCartney]] preferred to be represented by [[Lee Eastman|Lee]] and John Eastman, the father and brother respectively of McCartney's girlfriend [[Linda McCartney|Linda]], whom he married on March&amp;nbsp;12. Given a choice between Klein and the Eastmans, [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] preferred Klein. Following rancorous London meetings with both Eastmans, in April Klein was appointed as the Beatles' manager on an interim basis, with the Eastmans being appointed as their attorneys. Continued conflict between Klein and the Eastmans made this arrangement unworkable. The Eastmans were dismissed as the Beatles' attorneys, and on May&amp;nbsp;8 Klein was given a three-year contract as the business manager of the Beatles. McCartney refused to sign the contract but was out-voted by the other Beatles.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=159–175}}{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=324–326,330}}

Once in charge of Apple, Klein fired a large number of the organization's employees, including [[Apple Records]] president [[Ron Kass]], and replaced them with his own people.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=326-327}}{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=187-191}} He closed [[Apple Corps#Apple Electronics|Apple Electronics]], which was headed by [[Alexis Mardas]]. Mardas resigned his directorship in May 1971.&lt;ref name="IndependentApology"&gt;{{cite news|author=The Editor|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/john-alexis-mardas-412809.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401144708/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/john-alexis-mardas-412809.html |title=John Alexis Mardas |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=August 21, 2006|archivedate=April 1, 2011|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein's attempt to fire [[Neil Aspinall]], a longtime confidant of the Beatles, was immediately thwarted by the band.&lt;ref name="Perrone/Independent"&gt;{{cite news|first=Pierre|last=Perrone|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/allen-klein-notorious-business-manager-for-the-beatles-and-the-rolling-stones-1732780.html |title=Allen Klein: Notorious business manager for the Beatles and the Rolling Stones|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=July 5, 2009|accessdate=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein was hit with his first crisis in managing the Beatles when Clive Epstein, brother of Brian Epstein and chief heir to NEMS, the management company his brother had founded, sold NEMS to Triumph, a British investment group managed by Leonard Richenberg. NEMS held a 25% stake in the Beatles' earnings, which Klein as well as the Beatles themselves desperately wanted to buy out. This led to tough negotiations with Triumph. Klein ultimately secured the Beatles' rights in their previous work for just four annual payments amounting to 5% of their earnings. However, in the lead-up to those negotiations Richenberg commissioned a hostile investigative report on Klein, which ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' ran under the headline "The Toughest Wheeler-Dealer in the Pop Jungle".{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=167-168}}

An even more important battle to secure the Beatles a financial situation commensurate with their worldwide popular acclaim was with Northern Songs Ltd., the publishing company. [[Northern Songs]] was managed by [[Dick James]], whom Brian Epstein had rewarded with the Beatles' publishing rights in return for his helping them get placed on a TV show, ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (TV series)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'', early in their career. But James had constructed a contract that gave him an outsized share, and Epstein hadn't understood its implications. James knew that Klein would soon eliminate his perks, so he quickly offered to sell Northern Songs to [[Associated Television|ATV]], run by entertainment mogul [[Lew Grade, Baron Grade|Lew Grade]], rather than allow Lennon and McCartney an opportunity to buy back publishing rights to their own songs. Klein worked feverishly to pull together a consortium which would beat Grade's offer, but ultimately his efforts were derailed by infighting between McCartney and Lennon themselves.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=168-173}}{{sfn|Coleman|1984|pp=377-389}}{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=328}}

In September 1969, while Klein was in the midst of renegotiating the Beatles' unsatisfactory recording agreements with [[EMI]], Lennon told him of his plans to quit the group. It was agreed that this was the wrong time to either make or announce such a move.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=181}}{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=347}} EMI was loath to re-negotiate, but their American subsidiary, [[Capitol Records]], was so impressed by ''[[Abbey Road]]'' that they agreed to vastly improved royalty terms. McCartney joined his bandmates in endorsing the deal Klein had secured.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=168}}

''Abbey Road'' proved to be the Beatles' last true collaboration, but Klein recognised an opportunity in the band's shelved January 1969 album and related documentary project, both titled ''[[Get Back (The Beatles album)|Get Back]]'', to get another album release out of the splintered group while also fulfilling their obligation to provide one more film to [[United Artists]], the studio that had previously released both ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' [[Phil Spector]], the producer famous for his "[[wall of sound]]" recordings with artists such as [[the Ronettes]] and [[the Righteous Brothers]], was eager to sign on as producer for the album, which was eventually titled ''[[Let It Be]]''. McCartney didn't approve of Spector, but the other Beatles did.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=323}} This proved to be McCartney and Klein's last face-to-face meeting. However, Apple made $6 million in the first month following the May 1970 release of the record and the [[Let It Be (film)|film]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=185}}

Unhappy with production decisions on the ''Let It Be'' album and the other Beatles' decision to hire Klein as their manager, McCartney went public with his plans to leave the Beatles in April 1970.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=349-352}}{{sfn|Coleman|1984|p=379}} He wanted to be released from his partnership with Lennon, Starr, and Harrison, who had in recent months proved a steady three-to-one majority against McCartney's proposals. The Eastmans convinced McCartney to file suit against his former bandmates for dissolution of the Beatles' partnership, which he did on December 31, 1970.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=208}}

The judge ruled in McCartney's favor in March 1971. He decided that the combined financial affairs of the former Beatles should be placed in the care of a receiver until mutually acceptable terms for their break-up could be found. Klein thereby retained a position in the post-breakup solo careers of Harrison, Starr, and Lennon, but was no longer in charge of their affairs as a partnership.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=209-214}}{{sfn|Coleman|1984|p=380}}

==Solo Beatles==
For a time after [[the Beatles]]' contentious break-up, [[George Harrison]] was the most popular and successful of the former group. His November 1970 three-disc set, ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', was a sales triumph, and produced hit singles in "[[My Sweet Lord]]" and "[[What Is Life]]". In the spring of 1971, Harrison learned from his friend and mentor, [[Ravi Shankar]], about the desperate people of [[Bangladesh]], who had been devastated both by [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|military violence]] and a vicious [[1970 Bhola cyclone|cyclone]]. Harrison immediately set about organizing an event which would take place in [[Madison Square Garden]] within just five weeks—[[the Concert for Bangladesh]]—from which a live album could raise further funds for the Bangladeshi refugees. Klein hustled to get the invited artists, including [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Eric Clapton]], to play for free while donating their shares of royalties to charity, and convinced [[Capitol Records]] to grant an unprecedented 50% royalty rate. Klein coproduced the filmed concert documentary, also called ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (film)|The Concert for Bangladesh]]''.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=217-222}} The film and the [[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|album]] raised over $15 million. Klein had failed to register the shows as a [[UNICEF]] charity event, however;{{sfn|Soocher|2015|pp=xii, 200}} as a result, the proceeds were denied tax-exempt status in Britain and the US.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=180–81, 206}} The [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] attempted to tax the income, and $10 million of that amount was held back for years.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=217-222}}

Both Harrison and [[John Lennon]] soon became disenchanted with Klein.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=241–42}} By mid 1972, Harrison was appalled at the outcome of Klein's handling of the Bangladesh relief effort.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=192}} Aside from the question of its charity status, unwelcome attention had been drawn to the project after an article published in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine accused Klein of pocketing $1.14 on each copy of the live album (priced at $10){{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=188, 192}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Ben|last=Fong-Torres|title=Did Allen Klein Take Bangla Desh Money?|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=March 30, 1972|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/did-allen-klein-take-bangla-desh-money-19720330 |accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;—allegations that raised suspicions among the three former Beatles with regard to his conduct in their business affairs.{{sfn|Clayson|2003|pp=332–33}} Lennon also felt betrayed by Klein's lack of support for his and [[Yoko Ono]]'s increasingly politically focused work, which was typified by the couple's 1972 album ''[[Some Time in New York City]]''.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=185, 192}}{{refn|group=nb|Klein's opposition to ''Some Time in New York City'' was based on the likelihood that its US sales would fall short of 500,000 units, which would disqualify the former Beatles from receiving their second royalty increase, under the terms of their agreement with Capitol.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=185}} Before its release, Klein negotiated with the record company to have the album discounted from this contractual stipulation, so demonstrating a degree of foresight that, author [[Peter Doggett]] writes, "Lennon never gave him credit for" when discussing Klein's contribution.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=191}}}} In early 1973 Lennon, Harrison and Starr served notice that they would not be renewing Klein's management contract when it expired in March.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=234, 237}} Early the following month, Lennon told an interviewer: "Let's say possibly Paul's suspicions were right … and the timing was right."{{sfn|Badman|2001|p=95}}

Klein responded by suing the Beatles and [[Apple Corps|Apple]] in New York, in order to recoup the loans he had made to his three former clients and other costs owing to ABKCO. They then sued him in the London courts, citing excessive commission fees, the mishandling of the Concert for Bangladesh, his misrepresentation of their individual financial standings, and his failure to ensure that the roster of artists at [[Apple Records]] prospered under his control.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=211–12}}{{refn|group=nb|Klein immediately countersued in London, in November 1973, for $19 million in unpaid fees. He also sued McCartney separately, for $34 million, but the suit was thrown out of court.{{sfn|Badman|2001|p=111}}}} While the suits were ongoing, Klein made a play for the US portion of Harrison's publishing company, [[Harrisongs]], in late 1974, without success.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=213–15}}{{sfn|Soocher|2015|pp=176–77}} He also attempted to influence the outcome of Lennon's arrangement with music publisher [[Morris Levy]] regarding an alleged copyright infringement (of the [[Chuck Berry]] song "[[You Can't Catch Me]]") in Lennon's 1969 Beatles composition "[[Come Together]]".{{sfn|Soocher|2015|p=xii}} Lennon's song "[[Steel and Glass]]" from the 1974 album ''[[Walls and Bridges]]'' was his thinly veiled dig at Klein.{{sfn|Coleman|1984|p=476}}{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=242}}{{refn|group=nb|In 1970, Harrison had included the line "Beware of ABKCO" in an early demo version of the song "[[Beware of Darkness (song)|Beware of Darkness]]".{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=241–42}} During his 1974 North American tour—at the end of which he spent avoiding Klein's [[process server]] in New York{{sfn|Soocher|2015|pp=173–76}}—Harrison introduced a gag in the lyrics to "[[Sue Me, Sue You Blues]]": "Bring your lawyer and I'll bring Klein / Get together and we could have a bad time."{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=226}}}}

Klein's 1973 lawsuit against the Beatles was settled out of court in January 1977, with Ono representing the former bandmates.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=253}} Klein received a lump sum payment of approximately $5&amp;nbsp;million in lieu of future royalties and as repayment of the loans that ABKCO had made to the Beatles.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=241–42}}

Harrison had been sued for plagiarism in 1971 because of the alleged similarity of his song "My Sweet Lord" to "[[He's So Fine]]", which had been recorded by [[the Chiffons]] in 1963 and was owned by [[Bright Tunes Music]]. The case was still pending in 1976; as an alternate strategy to access Harrison's US publishing,{{sfn|Soocher|2015|p=177}} Klein now purchased Bright Tunes and thus became the plaintiff in the lawsuit against Harrison. The judge ruled that Harrison had infringed on Bright Tunes' copyright, and the ruling was upheld on appeal. The judge initially assessed damages of $2,133,316, which Harrison would have to pay to Klein, then reduced the figure to $1,599,987, but finally ruled in 1981 that Klein still had a fiduciary responsibility to Harrison and should not be allowed to profit from his acquisition of Bright Tunes. Klein was ordered to hold "He's So Fine" in trust for Harrison provided that Harrison reimburse him the $587,000 that it had cost Klein to purchase the company.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=238–41}}

==Films and theater==
The multi-[[Academy Award]]-winning 1955 film ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'', an independently produced movie that undercut the Hollywood studio system, provided a business template which Allen Klein closely studied and later adapted to the recording industry. In the late 1950s Klein shared an office with press agent Bernie Kamber, who represented [[Burt Lancaster]], one of ''Marty'''s producers. Klein absorbed much from Kamber on how the producers had structured their business model, a paradigm whose strength derived from the fact that artists drove marketplace success, not film studios or record labels, and that intense preparation and canny negotiation could lavishly reward artists and their representatives. In 1961 Klein did accountancy work for an independent film, ''Force of Impulse'', where he formed lasting relationships that he would turn to for many film projects of his own. In 1962 Klein produced a film called ''Without Each Other''. He took it to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and later claimed that it had won the "Best American Picture Award" there, though no such award actually existed. A distributor never materialized, but Klein's enthusiasm for film persisted.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=31-32}}

Starting in 1967 Klein produced four films in the [[Spaghetti Western]] genre, a lean-and-mean style of cowboy movie with taciturn heroes and explosive violence. Klein utilized actor [[Tony Anthony]], whom he'd met on ''Force of Impulse'', in all four. Their films included a trilogy comprising ''[[Un dollaro tra i denti|A Stranger In Town]]'',{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=125}} ''[[The Stranger Returns]]'' (1967), and ''[[The Silent Stranger]]'' (shot in 1968 but not released until 1975 by United Artists).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marco Giusti|title=Dizionario del western all'italiana|publisher=Mondadori, 2007|isbn=88-04-57277-9|pages=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/68546/stranger-trilogy-warner-archive-collection-a-stranger-in-town-the-stranger-returns-the-silent-stranger-the/ |title=The Stranger Trilogy (Warner Archive Collection: A Stranger in Town, The Stranger Returns, The Silent Stranger)  |last=Mavis |first=Paul |date=May 6, 2015 |publisher=DVDTalk.com |access-date=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blindman]]'' (1970) featured [[Ringo Starr]] as a Mexican bandit, Anthony as its lead, and Klein as an extra.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=203}} The first two "Stranger" films were released by [[MGM]] the studio where Klein produced ''[[Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter (film)|Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter]]'' starring the popular [[Herman's Hermits]].   Klein, who had tried to purchase MGM in the mid 60s{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=126-127}} became involved with a lawsuit against MGM with each accusing the other of not performing on their contracts with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=cCkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=Breach#v=onepage&amp;q=Breach&amp;f=false |author=News staff|title=Not So, Says AKKCO in Reply to MGM Pact Breach Charge|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 4, 1970|p=4|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 [[John Lennon]] directed Klein's attention to ''[[El Topo]]'', a surrealistic western by the Chilean director [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]. Inspired by Lennon's enthusiasm, Klein bought the film and put it in American release. He then produced and financed Jodorowsky's next film, ''[[The Holy Mountain (1973 film)|The Holy Mountain]]'', an allegorical journey with psychedelic overtones. Later the producer and the director's planned collaboration on a proposed film version of ''[[The Story of O]]'' was halted when Jodorowsky refused to make the film and to return substantial advance monies. Klein retaliated by withdrawing both ''El Topo'' and ''The Holy Mountain'' from distribution.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=227-228}} In 2008 Jodorowsky released the films in Europe and was sued by Klein. After a face-to-face reconciliation between the two men Klein dropped his lawsuit and [[ABKCO]] released the films on video, paying Jodorowsky to remaster them.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=275-276}}

In 1972 Klein co-produced ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (film)|The Concert for Bangladesh]]'', discussed above. Klein also produced the 1978 film ''[[The Greek Tycoon]]'', in which [[Anthony Quinn]] and [[Jacqueline Bisset]] played characters based on [[Aristotle Onassis]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=247-248}} In the early 1980s Klein produced two Broadway plays. ''It Had to be You'', a romantic comedy starring [[Renée Taylor]] and [[Joseph Bologna]], ran for barely a month. Next Klein produced ''[[The Man Who Had Three Arms]]'', written by [[Edward Albee]]. Although Albee had also written big successes in ''[[The Zoo Story]]'' and ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'', the play Klein produced had an even shorter run than his previous attempt.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=258}}

==Criminal conviction and jail time==
In 1977, Klein and [[ABKCO Records|ABKCO]]'s former head of promotion, [[Peter Bennett (music promoter)|Pete Bennett]], were each charged with three felony counts of attempted income tax evasion for 1970, 1971, and 1972, and related misdemeanor counts of making false statement on their income tax returns for each of those years. The [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], which had been investigating Klein for several years, claimed that Klein and Bennett had sold promotional copies of [[The Beatles|Beatles]] and post-Beatles albums—common practice in the music industry at the time—without declaring the sales on their tax returns. Klein was alleged to have received over $200,000. Bennett pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor charge and became a witness against Klein. Klein testified that he had not instructed Bennett to sell promotional copies of albums and that although he'd received cash payments from Bennett the payments were a return of cash advances which Bennett had been given. Klein's first trial ended in a mistrial because the jury was deadlocked. At his second trial in 1979 the jury found Klein innocent of the felony charges and convicted him of a single misdemeanor charge of making false statements on his 1972 tax return. Klein was fined $5,000 and sentenced to two months in jail, which he served in July–September&amp;nbsp;1980.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=245-253}}&lt;ref name="Sisario" /&gt;

==Phil Spector==

In 1988 Klein began managing [[Phil Spector]]’s business affairs, including his publishing and recording assets. Although Spector had not been active as a producer for several years, his early work was still frequently broadcast and also licensed for film soundtracks. Spector’s publishing company, Mother Bertha Music, Inc, was controlled by Trio, a [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]] company, which was in turn administered by [[Warner/Chappell Music]]. Warner/Chappell was making appropriate payments, but significant amounts were not being passed on to Spector. Klein's goal was to get Spector all the money owed him, and also to wrest a concession allowing Spector to co-administer the future licensing of his music. Klein and Spector brought suit in federal court. A courtroom win would secure the first goal, but not the second, so Klein advised a settlement strategy. It proved successful.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=264–265}}

==The Verve==

On their song "[[Bitter Sweet Symphony]]" the British [[alternative rock]] group [[the Verve]] sampled [[the Andrew Oldham Orchestra]]'s version of the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] song "[[The Last Time (The Rolling Stones song)|The Last Time]]," the rights to which were owned by [[ABKCO Records|ABKCO]], and included it on their 1997 album ''[[Urban Hymns]].'' The Verve had obtained the rights to sample the recording from [[Decca Records|Decca]], but had failed to consider obtaining the necessary permission from ABKCO itself till the album was ready for release by [[EMI Records|EMI]]. Realizing that he had the advantage in negotiations, Klein forced Verve vocalist [[Richard Ashcroft]] to sell his rights as lyricist to ABKCO for $1, and ABKCO became the sole publisher of "Bitter Sweet Symphony."

The song became a hit, popular for use at sporting events, and it was a big money-maker for ABKCO, which licensed its use for commercials advertising [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes and [[Opel]] automobiles. In 1999, [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]] were nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]], even though "Bitter Sweet Symphony" actually bears little resemblance to the Rolling Stones's "The Last Time."{{sfn|Goodman|pp=265-267}}

==Final days==
Klein was diagnosed with [[diabetes]] at age 40.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=268}} He suffered several heart attacks over the years, of varying severity. In 2004, when [[ABKCO Records|ABKCO]] collected a [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film|Grammy Award]] for a [[Sam Cooke]] documentary, ''Legend'', Klein fell and broke bones in his foot, requiring surgery. He was subsequently diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=273}} He died on July&amp;nbsp;4, 2009 in [[New York City]]. The cause of his death was respiratory failure. [[Yoko Ono]] and [[Sean Ono Lennon]] attended Klein's funeral. [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] testified at a subsequent memorial service that Klein had greatly magnified the success of [[the Rolling Stones]].{{sfn|Goodman|2015|p=275}}

In June 2015, American journalist Fred Goodman published a biography of Klein, ''Allen Klein: The Man Who Bailed Out the Beatles, Made the Stones, and Transformed Rock &amp; Roll''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/reconsidering-music-business-boogeyman-allen-klein-20150626 |first=Andy|last=Greene|title=Reconsidering Music-Business Boogeyman Allen Klein|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 26, 2015|accessdate=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

In the 1978 television [[mockumentary]] ''[[All You Need Is Cash|The Rutles: All You Need is Cash]]'', which parodies the career of the Beatles, Allen Klein is portrayed as "Ron Decline", played by [[John Belushi]]. Introduced as "the most feared promoter in the world", Decline is so intimidating to his colleagues that they choose to throw themselves out of skyscraper windows rather than face him.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=65}}

In his book ''[[You Never Give Me Your Money (book)|You Never Give Me Your Money: The Battle for the Soul of the Beatles]]'', [[Peter Doggett]] says that Klein has come to be seen as one of the controversial "intruders" in the Beatles' story. Doggett writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Suspected for their motives, hated for their disruptive power, they all arrived from America and were all regarded as suspects for the crime of breaking up the Beatles, on the assumption that without them the group would have continued happily in each other's company until their dying days. The first of these intruders was Yoko Ono; the second was Linda Eastman; and the third was Allen Klein.

With the possible exception of [[Magic Alex|Alexis Mardas]], who occupied a far less central role, nobody in the Beatles' milieu has received a more damning verdict from historians than Allen Klein. He was, one said, "a tough little scorpion"; for another, "fast-talking, dirty-mouthed … sloppily dressed and grossly overweight"; again, "short and fat, beady-eyed and greasily pompadoured". Beatles aide [[Alistair Taylor]] said, "He had all the charm of a broken lavatory seat" ... So consistent was the vilification that when biographer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]] merely described Klein as "a tubby little man", it sounded like a compliment.

… No such rehabilitation [as was later afforded Ono and Eastman] was available for Allen Klein, who entered the Beatles' story as a villain from central casting, and never escaped that role. Yet we are asked to believe that three of the four Beatles found this "beady-eyed" "grossly overweight" "scorpion" such an attractive figure that they were prepared to trust him with their futures. Clearly the Demon King didn't always excude the stench of sulphur.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=65–66}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Aurélio Pires Quaresma Martins''' (born November 24, 1966) is a [[São Tomé]]an journalist, businessman and politician, who until May 2018 was leader of the [[Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe/Social Democratic Party]]
(MLSTP/PSD). 

== Journalist and businessman ==
Martins started his career as a journalist at São Tomé and Príncipe's National Radio (Rádio Nacional) between 1984 and 1985, and later worked at Angola's National Radio (RNA) from 1999 to 2007. He is the head of construction and security company Gibela Group&lt;ref name="telan01" /&gt; and president of FAMA (Aurélio Martins' Foundation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.telanon.info/sociedade/2010/06/01/4235/parceria-entre-a-fundacao-aurelio-martins-e-a-camara-de-maia-portugal-poe-sorriso-no-rosto-das-criancas/ |title=Téla Nón: Parceria entre a Fundação Aurélio Martins e a Cámara de Maia-Portugal |first= |last= |work=telanon.info |year=2010 |accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="angop01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/pt_pt/noticias/sociedade/2010/2/9/Fundacao-Aurelio-Martins-FESA-perspectivam-acordo-parceria,0b6d3672-5b9e-48a1-a039-ba30bdeddd09.html |title=Angop: Fundação Aurélio Martins e FESA perspectivam acordo de parceria |first= |last= |work=portalangop.co.ao |year=2010 |accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
Martins was elected to the [[National Assembly of São Tomé and Príncipe]] for the [[Lobata District]] in the [[São Toméan legislative election, 2010|2010 legislative election]] and afterwards became president of the Humans Rights, Citizenship and Gender Commission in the National Assembly.

He was elected President of the MLSTP/PSD on the party's ordinary congress in January 2011.&lt;ref name="bbc01" /&gt;

Aurélio Martins was his party's candidate in the [[São Toméan presidential election, 2011|2011 presidential election]],&lt;ref name="telan01"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.telanon.info/politica/2011/01/17/6080/aurelio-martins-eleito-novo-lider-do-mlstppsd/ |title=Téla Nón: Aurélio Martins eleito novo líder do MLSTP/PSD |first= |last= |work=telanon.info |year=2011 |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc01"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/portugueseafrica/news/story/2011/01/110117_mlstpnewpresidentbp.shtml |title=BBCParaAfrica.com: Aurélio Martins eleito presidente do MLSTP-PSD |first= |last= |work=bbc.co.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but got only 4.06% of the votes and lost to former and MLSTP leader [[Manuel Pinto da Costa]].

== Downfall ==
He was suspended from the party in mid-May 2018 due to backing the government's dismissal of three supreme court justices (incl. the court's president) who had ruled in favour of handing over the [[Rosema Brewery]] in [[Neves, São Tomé and Príncipe|Neves]] - controlled by the party's largest donor Antonio Monteiros and his brother Domingos Monteiros, who were both MPs for the party - to an Angolan businessman.&lt;ref&gt;https://presidential-power.com/?cat=250&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced as party president with [[Jorge Bom Jesus]] at an extraordinary congress on 30 June.&lt;ref&gt;https://stpdigital.net/2018/07/01/elege-o-novo-presidente-do-mlstp-psd/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honours ==

'''Bachem''' is a  contract manufacturing organization headquartered in [[Bubendorf]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Bachem Holding AG|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=760034|publisher=Bloomberg|access-date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachem specializes in the manufacturing of [[peptides]] and complex organic molecules such as [[active pharmaceutical ingredients]].  In addition, biochemicals for research purposes and manufacturing processes are developed.  The firm provides a number of products and services to the pharmaceutical and [[biology|life science]] industries, including [[organic chemistry|organic]], [[fine chemicals|fine]] and performance chemicals, custom manufacturing of [[biopharmaceutical]]s, [[chemical synthesis]] capabilities and new chemical entities, and services for the [[bioscience]] sector.&lt;ref name=bloomberg /&gt;

==History&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bachem - History|url=http://www.bachem.com/company/history/|publisher=Bachem}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
In 1971, Peter Grogg founded Bachem Feinchemikalien AG with two employees in Liestal near Basel with the focus on peptide synthesis.  In 1977, Bachem moved with eight employees to nearby Bubendorf, and, in 1978, it manufactured, for the first time, peptides for use in medicine under cGMP guidelines.  Between 1981 and 1991 Bachem tripled its production capacity and built an administration building, and in 1995, facilities were further expanded including the quality control department to a total of 168'000 sq. ft. (15'600 m2).

Expansion into markets outside Europe began with the establishment of Bachem Bioscience, Inc. in Philadelphia, USA in 1987.  To strengthen its presence in Europe, Bachem opened sales and marketing centers in Germany in 1988 and in France in 1993.  In 1996 it acquired its largest competitor, Bachem, Inc., together with its subsidiaries in Germany and the United Kingdom. In June 1998, following a very successful IPO, Bachem's shares began to be publicly traded on the Swiss Stock Exchange.  In 1999 and 2000, a new administration building and a further production facility were respectively opened at the Bubendorf site.

With the acquisition of the San Carlos, California based Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. and its affiliate Peninsula Laboratories Ltd., United Kingdom in December 1999, Bachem extended its strong position in therapeutically active peptides into immunology, a domain with strong future promise.  In August 2000, Peninsula Laboratories Europe Ltd. and Bachem (UK) Ltd. merged to a single Bachem group affiliated company in the United Kingdom.
The acquisition of Sochinaz SA, a Swiss-based specialized manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients in 2001, strengthened Bachem's expertise and once again expanded its manufacturing capabilities.

Reorganization of distribution was carried out in Germany and France as a result of the positive experiences gained with the realignment of the sales and marketing organization in the USA.  As a result the subsidiary in France was closed at the end of 2002.  The subsidiary in Germany was relocated from Heidelberg to Weil am Rhein, was renamed Bachem Distribution Services GmbH and is now responsible for all customers in the European Union.
In 2003, a holding structure was introduced to align the factual organization of the company with an appropriate legal structure and to support management structure adjustments, given by continued company growth requirements.  In 2007, Bachem acquired the Clinalfa® brand for Bachem's ready-to-use clinical trial materials and related services.  In 2010, Bachem commenced the partnership with Atheris laboratories offering the Melusine® range of research products for lead generation of new pharmaceutical candidates.  In 2011, Bachem celebrated its 40th year as a producer of research ingredients and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for the pharmaceutical industry.

In 2013, Bachem and GlyTech Inc. teamed up to offer [[glycosylated]] peptides in their product pipelines. Bachem and affiliate were conducting groundbreaking work on [[interferon beta-1a]] and to manufacture glycosylated [[somatostatin]] analogues by chemical synthesis.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.glytech.jp/en/ Glytech Inc. News &amp; Topics]. Retrieved 19 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2015, Bachem acquired American Peptide Company, a mid-sized biotech establishment in [[Sunnyvale]] CA, not far from Bachem's US facility in Torrance, expanding the firm's GMP manufacturing and R&amp;D capabilities for the US and international markets.&lt;ref&gt; R.Mullin (2015).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4483">In June 1989, as Poland turned away from communism, a group of British-Polish students and graduates, Polish expats and British businessmen, established ‘Interes’, an organisation promoting business, trade and investment between Britain and Poland.

Under the Chairmanship of Leszek Jakubowski who took over from Barbara Stachowiak in 1993, Interes and the Polish Enterprise Centre were transformed into the British Polish Chamber of Commerce (BPCC), a non-profit organization incorporated in the UK in 1995 as a company limited by guarantee, with Juliusz Bogacki as its Chief Executive. In 1997 the BPCC moved to the Ognisko Polskie on Exhibition Road, where it continued to promote bilateral trade and investment between Britain and Poland, running conferences, workshops, trade missions, business clinics and its regular monthly Open Forum meetings, as well as publish ‘Eagle Eye’, the Chamber magazine.

In 1998/9 the British Polish Chamber of Commerce (BPCC) amalgamated with its sister organisation the British Chamber of Commerce in Poland (BCCP) to form one bilateral organisation.

The British Chamber of Commerce in Poland (BCCP) was established in 1992 as a [[non-profit organization]] incorporated in the UK as a [[company limited by guarantee]]. Its original role was to support British companies investing in the Polish market, shortly after the country's economic transformation. In 2001, the Chamber changed its name and its statute to become a bilateral chamber, supporting two-way trade and investment relations between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Poland]]. 

The Chamber's regular events in Poland include business mixers, conferences, seminars and workshops aimed at the international business community and at Polish exporters interested in the UK market. Shortly before Poland joined the EU on 1 May, 2004, the BPCC began holding regular events in London, looking at various aspects of doing business in Poland. After Poland's EU Accession, the BPCC began organising regular recruitment fairs, matching UK companies and employment agencies with Polish workers seeking to work in the UK. These have been held around Poland and in London. Since February 2007, the BPCC has been holding events in London, the Midlands, the North and Scotland aimed at Polish entrepreneurs that have set up businesses in the UK.

Since July 2013, the Chamber has been engaged on a joint project with [[UK Trade and Investment]] as part of the UK Government's Overseas Business Network initiative to support UK exporters. A separate team was recruited to identify Polish importers, distributors, wholesalers and agents and match them with potential UK exporters. 

Since October 2014, the Chamber has mirrored the trade project to offer similar support to Polish exporters, identifying for them UK importers, distributors, wholesalers and agents, matched to a Sourcing From Poland service for UK importers.

==Officers==
The present Chief Executive Officer is Paweł Siwecki, who replaced Joe Tunney in December 2012. Martin Oxley was the chamber's CEO from 2005 to 2011, when he left the Chamber to head up the UKTI team at the British Embassy in Warsaw. Before Oxley became CEO, day-to-day running of the chamber was the responsibility of Executive Director Barbara Stachowiak-Kowalska MBE (from 1993 to 2005). 

Antoni F. Reczek, President of PwC Polska, replaced Alan Jarman as Chairman of the Board in June 2012.

== Recent activities and achievements==
The British Polish Chamber of Commerce has been awarded 'best British chamber in continental Europe' for four years in a row (2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005) by COBCOE, the Council of British Chambers of Commerce in Continental Europe. The BPCC was runner-up for this award in 2004 and 2003.

For three years in a row, the BPCC has been awarded the best British chamber for trade development (2014, 2015 and 2016), recognising its preeminent position as a UKTI/DIT Overseas Delivery Partner.

Since August 2014, the BPCC has been an accredited chamber within the British Chambers of Commerce, the second British chamber outside the UK to win accreditation. In April 2015, the BPCC was also accredited by COBCOE.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3114">'''Camille Maximilien Frédéric, Count de Renesse-Breidbach''' (9 July 1836 in [[Brussels]] – 12 June 1904 in [[Nice]]) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[nobleman]], entrepreneur and author.

De Renesse was born in 1836 at Brussels to an aristocratical family of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] descent. His parents were Maximilien C.J.G.R van Renesse Breidbach and Berthe Walburge Francoise van Gruben. He was a grandson of Clement Wenceslas van Renesse Breidbach (1774-1833), who had sold the ancestral [[Castle of Renesse]] to [[Leonard Pierre Joseph du Bus de Gisignies|Leonard du Bus de Gisignies]].

Camille married Countess [[Malvina de Kerchhove de Deterghem]] on 10 November 1868, daughter of Count [[Charles de Kerchove de Denterghem|Charles-Constant de Kerchhove de Deterghem]] (1819-1882) and Eugénie de Limon (1824-1899). While dwelling in [[St. Moritz]] for recreation Count de Renesse got his vision to establish a giant Monte Carlo-like hotel resort with a grand [[hotel]], baths and golf courses in the [[Engadin]] valley for the European aristocracy. After being rejected in [[Celerina/Schlarigna|Celerina]], [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils]] and finally in St. Moritz due to the Badrutt family's huge power, Count de Renesse succeeded in purchasing some 140 hectares of land in [[Maloja (district)|Maloja]], at the [[Lake of Sils]].

Between 1882 and 1884 he put his vision to reality by letting build the ''Hôtel Kursaal de la Maloja'' (nowadays [[Maloja Palace]]). But since just a few days after the grand opening a [[cholera]] epidemic broke out in nearby [[Italy]], Count de Renesse had to file for [[bankruptcy]] after six months. Furthermore, Countess Marvina died of a so-called "fat heart" in [[Basel]] in the same autumn. Nonetheless the hotel remained a lucrative location for Europe's rich people in the following decades. In 1891, [[Stanford University]] completed Encina Hall, a dormitory inspired by the Hôtel Kursaal de la Maloja's architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfST/ST24no1.pdf Encina Hall: Leland Stanford's Grand Hotel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624225614/http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfST/ST24no1.pdf |date=24 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time a rumour has got abroad that Count de Renesse, being drunk, fell off his residence, the Belvedere tower above the hotel, into the [[Bergell]] valley; in fact he moved to Nice where he wrote some Christian books; there he died in 1904.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="911">In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Scots Law]], a '''commodate''' (''commodatum'') is a gratuitous [[loan]]; a loan, or free concession of anything [[Personal property|moveable]] or immoveable, for a certain timeframe, on condition of restoring again the same individual after a certain time.

It is a kind of loan, or [[contract]], with one difference: the commodate is ''[[wikt:gratis|gratis]]'', and does not transfer the property; the thing must be returned in essence, and without deterioration, so that things which consume by use, or time, cannot be objects of a commodate, but of a loan, because although they may be returned in kind, they cannot in identity.

'''David Zeiger''' (February 21, 1918 - May 10, 1981) Brazilian industrialist in the area of clothing and fashion.

Zeiger's family immigrated from [[Ukraine]] (the part of Ukraine that was then part of [[Poland]]) to [[Brazil]] in the early 1920s. David, with his siblings and mother, met with his father Shaja Zeiger, who had left Poland a year earlier. Shaja Zeiger was a tailor, and in a few years founded Goomtex, a factory for raincoats and overcoats. As a young man, David Zeiger worked with his father, and soon became the manager of the business. After his marriage, David Zeiger began to run Pullsport—a women's fashion factory—along with his wife [[Mila Zeiger|Mila]].

David Zeiger also dedicated his energy to the areas of culture, philanthropy, and publicity.

==Early Years and Education==
[[Image:David Zeiger Diploma do clube portugues 1964.jpg|thumb|left]]
Zeiger was born in [[Kovel]], Poland, which is now part of [[Ukraine]]. Although raised and educated within the community of Jewish immigrants in the [[São Paulo]] neighborhood of [[Bom Retiro (District of São Paulo)|Bom Retiro]], the adolescent Zeiger already had a good command of Portuguese and a curiosity for Brazilian culture that led him to seek friendships outside the small European community where he lived.

He became a member of the Espéria club, and of the Tietê [[regatta]] club in which he participated as a rower in competitions. He joined the Portugália club, which published a newspaper with texts written by various members. His news stories and fiction began to be published under the guidance of the poet Mario Gallo. Zeiger finished his education at the São Paulo Technical School of Accounting.

==Community Activities==

[[Image:David Zeiger Carta de Scylla Medici 1972-01-27.jpg|thumb|right|180px]]
After [[World War II]], Zeiger began his philanthropic activities. He helped raise funds and contributed his own resources to the newly created state of [[Israel]].

Most of his efforts were for social causes focused on Brazil. He assisted Carmem Prudente in the establishment of the [[Institute of Cancer of São Paulo|Hospital do Câncer]], and in the charitable campaigns that followed. 

[[Image:Diploma de Benemérito - Hospital Albert Einstein.jpg|miniaturadaimagem|180x180px|right]]
He was an initial donor of the [[Albert Einstein Hospital|Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein]]. He gave medical access to his employees through the  network of SERMA clinics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sermasaude.org/rede-credenciada-da-serma.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizenship and Politics==
[[Image:David Zeiger com Deputado Cunha Bueno.jpg|thumb|right|260px]]
[[Image:David Zeiger com Pele.jpg|thumb|left|120px]]
Zeiger believed in a Brazil based on the market economy of the United States—with a vast middle class, general access to education and medical services. During the [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] administration (1956 to 1961), he found a favorable climate for this view, which would help Brazil to move out of its agrarian economy to become an industrial giant. At that time Zeiger met congressman Antônio Sílvio Cunha Bueno, with whom he developed a long friendship, and through which he began to participate more actively in the political life of the country. Zeiger promoted Cunha Bueno within the Jewish community. The friendship with the Cunha Bueno family resulted in two homages: David Zeiger Public School, and David Zeiger Street, both in São Paulo.

==Career==
[[Image:Marca Pull Sport.jpg|thumb|left|150px]]
During the years of the "Economic Miracle" in the 1960s and 1970s, David Zeiger's business expanded quickly. His factory (Cia Pullsport of Malharia) grew to occupy two buildings of seven floors with 500 employees.

In 1967, [[Time Magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;TIME Magazine, ''Brazil's President Costa e Silva'', 1967/04/21&lt;/ref&gt; published a cover story with the photo of [[Artur da Costa e Silva|President Costa e Silva]]. The subject was the surge of progress in the economy of Brazil. It quoted examples of leaders in various fields of activity, and presented Zeiger as an example of an industrialist. Zeiger had an unpretentious and communicative character, which he demonstrated equally with both his company employees and important personalities.

==Other interests==

[[Image:David Zeiger Homenagem da Fundação Bienal de São Paulo 1981 Carta Luiz Villares.jpg|thumb|right]]
Zeiger participated from the beginning in the textile fairs established by Caio de Alcântara Machado (FENIT), the board of directors of the International Art Biennial of São Paulo&lt;ref&gt;''(In Portuguese)'' XVI Bienal de São Paulo, ''http://issuu.com/bienal/docs/nameafc024'', Homenagem da Fundação Bienal de São Paulo, 16 outubro a 20 de dezembro de 1981&lt;/ref&gt; , and sponsored a project aimed at integrating a cultural center with theaters and concert halls in the [[Ibirapuera Park]]. He was also an art collector. In his view, the city of São Paulo had the potential to become the most important metropolis in [[Latin America]].

'''''DinoPark Tycoon''''' is an [[educational game|educational]] [[business simulation game|business simulation]] [[computer game]] released by [[MECC]] in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] for [[MS-DOS]] and [[MacOS]]. Players run a [[theme park]] which features dinosaurs as its main attraction. The goal of the game is to care for the dinosaurs while keeping the park clean, organized, and well maintained.

== Background ==

''DinoPark Tycoon'' was developed by [[Manley &amp; Associates|Manley &amp; Associates Inc.]] and published by [[MECC]] (later [[SoftKey]]). Two versions were released: a retail version and a special school version, which was released to public elementary schools across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. In addition to the retail software, the school version includes background information and classroom activities for teachers.&lt;ref name="amag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue162/90_DinoPark_Tycoon.php |title=DinoPark Tycoon |publisher=Atarimagazines.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not required by the schools' curricula, but was intended to be a fun way for the students to learn basic finance and management skills.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Writer Larry Blasko of the [[Associated Press]] described the game as having realistic similarities to real-life business management, along with skills such as mathematical estimation and "what if?" analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kids can create their own 'Jurassic Park' |author=Blasko, Larry |date=1993-12-18 |page=6 |publisher=[[The Free Lance-Star]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z14zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mAcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3577%2C3837895 |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==

The objective in ''DinoPark Tycoon'' is the successful administration of a dinosaur park. Players start off with a $5,000 loan in the retail version, or a $20,000 loan in the school version.&lt;ref name="amag" /&gt; The money is used to pay for the land, dinosaurs, fencing, food and employees necessary to run the park and pay back the loan; failure to meet loan payments results in the park's foreclosure.&lt;ref name="amag" /&gt; Once the loan is paid off, players may expand the park and earn profits. If players are confused, an animated dinosaur appears and guides the players through the game.&lt;ref name="amag" /&gt;

Players then visit supply stores to buy the necessary items for park maintenance. The food store provides meat for carnivores, plants for herbivores and seeds for planting. The general store provides fences for the dinosaur pens, with varying degrees of strength and price; concessions such as bathrooms, gift shops and parking lots; and advertising, which is bought per season. The employment office offers the personnel to run the park, and Dino City retails the dinosaurs for the exhibits.&lt;ref name="amag" /&gt;

As time passes, players face problems such as escaping dinosaurs, sick employees, and seasonal attendance declines. According to [[Atari]], "Keeping the staff paid and the dinos fed and healthy is an ongoing task that requires kids to analyze graphs and numbers and make decisions based on their assumptions. The trick is to scratch out enough profit to expand the park with capital improvements and bigger and better dinosaurs."&lt;ref name="amag" /&gt; After paying off the loan, players may choose to sell their park; if it has been successful, the player achieves an onscreen award and an entry on the top scores list.&lt;ref name="amag" /&gt;

== Ports ==

''DinoPark Tycoon'' was released for the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] home video game console in early 1994. It contains minor changes to gameplay and graphics.

The '''Diplôme d'Ingénieur''' ({{IPA-fr|diplom dɛ̃ʒenjœʁ|lang}}, often abbreviated as ''Dipl. Ing.'') is a postgraduate degree in engineering ''(see [[Engineer's degree|Engineer's Degrees in Europe]])'' awarded by the French [[Grandes Écoles]] in engineering. It is generally obtained after five to seven years of studies after the French [[Baccalauréat]].

Each holder of the diplôme d'ingénieur is also conferred the title of ''Ingénieur diplômé'' (graduate engineer). This is distinguished from the term '''ingénieur''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' (engineer) which is non-regulated and can be loosely used as a generic title based on one's professional position or nature of work rather than formal academic qualifications. 

Diplôme d'ingénieur graduates from reputable institutions often access the French job market with a significant advantage compared to PhDs. However, this is not always true for all industries, and roles that require high technical expertise (especially research in specific area) will favor a specialized master's or PhD qualification. 

==Accreditation==
The title ''Ingénieur diplômé'' is a strictly regulated and protected by the French state. Any institution issuing the diplôme d'ingénieur must be accredited by the [[Commission des titres d'ingénieur]] (within the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research) which is the official administrative body responsible for evaluating higher education institutions to train professional engineers in France. Anyone found to be misusing the title of ''Ingénieur diplômé'' is liable to a €15,000 fine and a one-year sentence in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000021342951&amp;dateTexte=20151002|title=Article 433-17 of the French Penal Code|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=French|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071191&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006525290&amp;dateTexte=20151002|title=Article L642-12 of the French Educational Code|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=French|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the signing of the [[Bologna Process]] in 1999, the European [[Master's Degree]] is also conferred by the state to the holder of a diplôme d'ingénieur, but the converse is not true. This is because the diplôme d'ingénieur is recognised to include, but significantly surpass, a [[Bologna Process]] [[Master's Degree]]. 

The diplôme d'ingénieur is also recognized in the United States by the [[AACRAO]] since 2013 as "Master of Science in Engineering".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cti-commission.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mou_aacrao-cti.pdf Memorandum of Understanding (AACRAO - CTI)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grandes Écoles and Universities in France ==
France is particular in that only accredited [[Grandes écoles|Grandes Écoles]] in engineering are certified to issue the diplôme d'ingénieur, which is differentiated from bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering issued by public universities (Universités).

Universities in France are comprehensive institutions composed of several faculties covering various fields (natural sciences, engineering, law, economics, medicine, humanities, etc) with a large student body. By law, admission to a French university is non-competitive and open to anyone with a high school diploma. On the other hand, Grandes Écoles in engineering are much smaller in size and recruit their students with very selective processes (typically a few hundred students per year per institution, and a few thousand students per year country-wide), with the minimum qualification being 2 years of post-baccalureate studies in scientific [[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|classes préparatoires]], three to four years University studies (Bachelors or Masters), or an otherwise equivalent training for foreign students, in order to be admitted to the engineer training in one of the Grandes Écoles.

==Curriculum==
The engineer training leading to the diplôme d'ingénieur may vary significantly among the Grandes Écoles in terms of curriculum structure, despite the same accreditation from CTI. In general, the most prestigious (therefore highly selective) Grandes Écoles tend to offer a multidisciplinary&lt;nowiki/&gt; curriculum for their flagship engineer program, exposing students to various fields of study with each courses taught at a graduate level. The multidisciplinary engineer program in the so-called 'generalist' Grandes Écoles is usually considered to be more competitive and intensive than specialized master's degree programs. However, this is not always the case, and there are a number of well-established Grandes Écoles that focus on a specialized curriculum for their engineer program.

Student engineers in Grandes Écoles are educated in close cooperation with the various industries through academic-industry partnerships, which introduce graduates to professional life while giving them a solid grounding in their discipline. As many graduates will advance to positions leading future projects and teams, courses related to management and professional training are also included in the curriculum.

In addition to the core curriculum in engineering and science, the French engineer training often includes, and is not limited to:
* courses in humanities and social sciences
* courses in business administration
* visits to production sites
* conferences and career talks by professionals
* internships and research projects

==Professional training==
More than 90 percent of the French engineer programs require at least one internship (typically in a business setting) at some point in the curriculum.

Most schools arrange three types of internships that train the students with progressive responsibilities, initially as observers and increasingly as actors, in order to gain a comprehensive understanding and perspective of all levels of responsibility and roles within the industry. One can distinguish “worker” (blue-collar) internships, “senior technician” internships, and “graduate” internships where the students perform the same type of work they will do as graduate engineers. Internships are graded and constitute part of the academic degree requirements.

The organization also offers the Certified International Trade Professional designation, also trademarked as the FITT International Business Professional designation in the U.S. and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fittfortrade.com/fibp-details|title=FIBP Details|website=Forum for International Trade Training (FITT)|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often referred to as the CITP|FIBP designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fittfortrade.com/certification|title=Professional International Business Certification CITP {{!}} FIBP|website=Forum for International Trade Training (FITT)|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In French, it is referred to as the Professionnel accrédité en commerce international (PACI|FPAI) designation.

FITT's strategic partners are [[Export Development Canada|Export Development Canada (EDC)]], [[Global Affairs Canada|Global Affairs Canada (GAC)]] and the [[World Trade Centers Association]].

== History ==
In the late 1980s, Dieter Hollweck,  began the planning towards a new organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tradeready.ca/2014/inside-stories/story-began-us-forum-international-trade-training-fitt/|title=The story of how it all began for us, the Forum for International Trade Training (FITT) - Trade Ready|website=Trade Ready|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; FITT was then incorporated in 1992 as part of Canada’s sector council initiative.

FITT first launched its FITTskills training program in 1993, which is now in its sixth edition, with the seventh edition being launched in early 2017. In 1996, it also launched the Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) process to allow business professionals to use their previous work and educational experience to earn FITTskills credits. FITTskills courses were first offered online in 1999, which continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fittfortrade.com/about-us/milestones|title=Milestones|website=Forum for International Trade Training (FITT)|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, FITT began to accredit [[academic institution]]s and organizations already offering international business courses to offer FITTskills courses. There are currently over 43 educational partners in Canada, China, Colombia, Malaysia, Romania and the UK, offering FITTskills courses in a classroom setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fittfortrade.com/instructorled-courses|title=Instructor Led Courses|website=Forum for International Trade Training (FITT)|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FITT's CITP designation was first offered in 1998, and the competency requirements were revised in 2006 and again in 2016. Since 2009, it has also been trademarked as the FIBP designation in the U.S. and Europe.

FITT has also awarded honorary CITP|FIBP designations to several notable figures in international trade, including former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister [[John Manley]], Canadian Chamber of Commerce CEO [[Perrin Beatty]], Governor of the [[Bank of Canada]] [[Stephen Poloz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eshaabrol.com/tag/citp-designation/|title=CITP Designation {{!}} Entrepreneur Journal|website=eshaabrol.com|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smith.queensu.ca/emails/poloz.php|title=QBC Ottawa featuring Stephen Poloz|website=smith.queensu.ca|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former Canadian [[Minister of International Trade (Canada)|Minister of International Trade]] [[Stockwell Day]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13378">[[File:Jacobs Field Cleveland.JPG|thumb|1999 aerial view of the complex and [[downtown Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] ]]
The '''Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex''' is an entertainment complex located in [[Downtown Cleveland|downtown]] [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. It opened in 1994 and is owned by the city of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County and is managed by the '''Gateway Economic Development Corporation''', a non-profit group with board members who are appointed by county and city leaders.&lt;ref name="PD1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gomez |first=Henry J. |title=Cleveland Indians pondering a facelift at Progressive Field, but funding is a mystery |url=http://www.cleveland.com/cuyahoga-county/index.ssf/2010/05/cleveland_indians_pondering_a_facelift_at_progressive_field_but_funding_is_a_mystery.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex mainly consists of [[Progressive Field]], a 35,051-seat baseball park that serves as home of the [[Cleveland Indians]] of [[Major League Baseball]], and [[Quicken Loans Arena]], a 19,432-seat arena primarily the home of the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]. In addition, the complex includes a transitional space known as Gateway Plaza and the Gateway East parking garage.

Gateway is roughly bounded by East 9th Street to the east, Huron Road to the north, Ontario Street to the west, and Carnegie Avenue to the south, and forms the basis of the larger Gateway District of downtown Cleveland.

==Facilities==
[[File:A gathering of baseball fans fills the plaza between Quicken Loan Arena and Progressive Field in Cleveland, Ohio, during Game 7 of the World Series between the Cleveland Indians and Chicago Cubs, Nov. 2, 2016. (K.Farabaugh-VOA).jpg|thumb|Fans fill Gateway Plaza during game seven of the [[2016 World Series]]]]
The two facilities are connected to [[Tower City Center]] and the [[RTA Rapid Transit]] system via an underground walkway.

[[Progressive Field]] was completed first, opening on April 4, 1994, as Jacobs Field. It cost approximately $175 million to build, of which $91 million, or 52%, came from Indians owner [[Richard Jacobs (businessman)|Richard Jacobs]]. The remaining $84 million, or 48%, was from a 15-year [[sin tax]]. It was designed by HOK Sport (now known as [[Populous (architects)|Populous]]), a division of [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum]]. HOK designed it as a [[Baseball park#Retro-modern ballparks|retro-modern ballpark]], similar to their just-completed [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] in Baltimore, with asymmetrical fences of varying heights, a smaller upper deck, and stepped tiers. The ballpark was situated in a way that would showcase Cleveland's downtown skyline.

[[Quicken Loans Arena]], originally named Gund Arena, has dimensions of {{convert|480|ft|m}} long by {{convert|440|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|140|ft|m}} high ({{convert|750000|sqft|m2}}). It was designed by [[Ellerbe Becket]] Sports &amp; Venue and Robert P. Madison International Inc., a local architectural firm. Similar to the ballpark's downtown views, the arena has a {{convert|108|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|48|ft|m|adj=on}} bay window that faces southeast and shows off the city's industrial [[The Flats|Flats]]. The construction and engineering were completed by an integrated team from Ellerbe Becket. The underground service area can accommodate 26 tour buses.&lt;ref name="GWay1"&gt;[http://www.gatewaysportscomplex.net/staff.html Gateway Economic Development Corporation] gatewaysportscomplex.net (accessed July 5, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was built for approximately $152 million and opened on October 17, 1994.

Gateway Plaza is multifunctional open space situated between Quicken Loans Arena to the north, Ontario Street to the west, Gateway East parking garage to the west, and Progressive Field to the south.  However, it is technically bordered by Bolivar Road, Ontario Street, East 6th Street, and Larry Doby Way.  It is primarily concrete roadway, but it does features decorative industrial art pieces and limited green space.  On game days, it frequently hosts on-location radio and television broadcasts, along with [[satellite truck]]s for TV broadcast [[uplink]]s, as well as other game-related events.  Some events for the [[1997 MLB All-Star Game]] Fan Fest were held in Gateway Plaza.

The complex was built with two parking garages, which can hold a combined 3,300 cars. On the north end of the complex is the Jack Parking Garage, previously the Gateway North garage. It is a rectangular-shaped structure, with its main entrance on Ontario Street and another two on High Street. Originally, a third floor enclosed walkway above Huron Road connected its southeast corner to The Q, but this was removed in 2018 as part of a major renovation project on the arena. A second enclosed walkway was built in 2013 on the northwest corner of the garage that connects to [[Jack Cleveland Casino]]. The city of Cleveland built a downtown [[bike station]] in this garage in 2011. That same year, the facility was sold to Rock Caesar's Ohio and renovated to include a valet service and to serve as the main parking area for the casino. The garage is still available for events at Gateway, though is managed by the casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Finishing Touches on Horseshoe Casino’s Skywalk |url=http://fox8.com/2013/12/30/finishing-touches-on-horseshoe-casinos-skywalk/ |author=Correa, Enrique |publisher=[[WJW (TV)|WJW]] |work=Fox8.com |date=December 30, 2013 |accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cleveland sells Gateway North Garage for $21 million for casino valet center |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/06/cleveland_sells_gateway_north.html |author=Davis, Dave |date=June 7, 2011 |accessdate=February 7, 2017 |work=Cleveland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Parking Rates |url=https://www.jackentertainment.com/cleveland/parkinginfo/ |publisher=[[Jack Cleveland Casino]] |work=JackEntertainment.com |year=2017 |accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In between The Q and Progressive Field is the Gateway East garage, an L-shaped structure with two elevated walkways. A third floor enclosed walkway above East 6th Street connects on its western side to The Q, while an open walkway on the south side of the garage connects to the ballpark above Larry Doby Way. Originally there was an additional walkway over Larry Doby Way to the ballpark, but it was removed in 2014 during renovations to Progressive Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Progress Being Made on Progressive Field Renovations |url=http://didthetribewinlastnight.com/blog/2014/10/29/progress-being-made-on-progressive-field-renovations/ |author=Toth, Bob |date=October 29, 2014 |work=DidTheTribeWinLastNight.com |accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gateway East Garage main entrance is on Huron Road, with a season-ticket holders entrance at East 6th and Bolivar and another at East 7th and Bolivar.  It is managed by Standard Parking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Parking &amp; Transportation |url=http://www.clevelandgatewaydistrict.com/visit/parking/ |publisher=Historic Gateway Neighborhood Corporation |work=ClevelandGatewayDistrict.com |year=2017 |accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Directions |url=http://www.theqarena.com/plan-your-visit/directions |year=2017 |publisher=Quicken Loans Arena |work=TheQArena.com |accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gateway complex had its genesis in the early 1980s. The city of Cleveland had longed to bring the Cavaliers back to Cleveland since the team left for the [[Richfield Coliseum]] in 1974.  Moreover, the Browns and Indians were housed in [[Cleveland Stadium]], which was costing the city money in a time when it could ill-afford it.  A major-league caliber sporting facility hadn't been built in Cleveland itself since the now-demolished [[Cleveland Arena]] opened in 1937.

A multipurpose dome would be the new home to the Browns and Indians, and would attract the Cavaliers back to Cleveland, according to the original proposal by County Commissioner Vincent Campanella.&lt;ref name="Dome1"&gt;Knight, Jonathan [https://books.google.com/books?id=GaZMr_8pLgsC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Greater+Cleveland+Domed+Stadium+Corp.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Zy0Rjz3OXL&amp;sig=ITGewaI0RWUxqgUNilvoF88U1Go&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=P0EyTPC4DIbGlQe_mrC-Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Opening day: Cleveland, the Indians, and a new beginning] (accessed July 5, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was modeled after the [[Pontiac Silverdome]], then home to the [[Detroit Lions]].  Browns owner [[Art Modell]] backed the domed stadium idea, as did Ohio Governor [[Dick Celeste]], however, he did not like funding the project with property taxes. On May 8, 1984, a ballot initiative for the $150 million dome stadium went down in defeat by a 2-1 margin. In 1985, another dome called Hexatron, a six-sided structure with a [[retractable roof]] designed by local architect Robert Corna, was proposed but never left the drafting table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Jay |url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20100301/30THANNIVERSARY/100229858 |title=The biggest unbuilt projects of the last 30 years |work=Crain's Cleveland Business |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposed funding for Hexatron would be a [[sin tax]] on alcohol and cigarettes in [[Cuyahoga County]], an idea floated by a young member of the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] named [[Jeff Jacobs (Ohio)|Jeff Jacobs]], the son of the future Indians owner Richard Jacobs.

Still, Cleveland Mayor [[George Voinovich]] and Governor Celeste pushed forward to create the Greater Cleveland Dome Stadium Corporation, borrowing $22 million from banks and the state of Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Poh Miller, Robert Anthony Wheeler [https://books.google.com/books?id=qJgpDMlCOPEC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=Greater+Cleveland+Dome+Stadium+Corp.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PLkf_p2Cg1&amp;sig=B72ITFZzdHD7MhiEUMNV9FvZ1jI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YW4yTN2KIsWAlAeis5jBCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cleveland: a concise history, 1796-1996] (accessed July 5, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Cleveland Tomorrow, a group of top executives from Cleveland's biggest firms, launched a development fund to further the project, and acquisition of property began in December 1985.&lt;ref name="QLA1"&gt;[http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=QLA QUICKEN LOANS ARENA] ''The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History'' (accessed July 5, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1989, the site of the former Central Market, a fruit and vegetable market that dated back to 1856,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CM CENTRAL MARKET] ''The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History'' (accessed July 5, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and other adjacent buildings were razed and made into parking lots.  However, there were funding gaps and big disagreements as to who would pay to build the project, along with a change in leadership.

===Ballot Issue 2===
In 1990, new leadership took the baton from the dome stadium group. The team was a partnership of Cleveland Tomorrow, led by lawyer [[Tom Chema]], and a group of elected officials.  The group included newly elected Mayor [[Michael R. White]], newly elevated [[Cleveland City Council]] President [[Jay Westbrook]], along with Cuyahoga County Commissioners [[Tim Hagan]], Virgil Brown, [[Mary O. Boyle|Mary Boyle]], and [[Jim Petro]].  The group hastily coordinated a plan to finance the complex by asking county voters for a 15-year sin tax, styled after the Hexatron plan. The tax, which amounted to 1.9 cents on a can of beer, 1.5 cents per ounce of liquor, and 4.5 cents on a pack of cigarettes, would be a way get suburban county voters to pay for the project. But it required a countywide vote, which added it to the May primary election ballot as "Issue 2" in the hopes that it would pass with the normally light turnout.

There was heavy advertising both for and against Issue 2. There was also a [[1990 Major League Baseball lockout|Major League Baseball lockout]] in February 1990 over player salaries.  It directly threatened weaker teams, such as the Indians, that did not have the cushion of additional revenues from luxury boxes and other stadium amenities.  Just days before the vote, baseball commissioner [[Fay Vincent]] attended a city council finance committee meeting and stated, "should the vote [on Issue 2] be a negative one, we may find ourselves confronting a subject we want to avoid."&lt;ref name="Dome1" /&gt;

These factors helped drive a large turnout, as 49.6% of registered voters cast ballots.  On May 8, 1990, Issue 2 passed by a slim 51% margin (198,390-185,209).&lt;ref name="Dome1" /&gt;  A month later, Mayor White and Commissioner Hagan created Gateway [[Economic Development Corporation]], a non-profit organization, and installed Chema as its executive director.

Both venues were completed in 1994. Todd Greathouse is the current executive director of the Gateway Economic Development Corporation.&lt;ref name="GWay1"/&gt;

[[File:Archives of American Art - George Biddle - 1969 CROPPED.jpg|thumb|230px|right|George Biddle in 1936, at work on his mural ''Society Freed Through Justice'', in the [[Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building]] in Washington, D.C.]]
'''George Biddle''' (January 24, 1885 – November 6, 1973) was an American painter, muralist and lithographer, best known for his [[social realism]] and [[combat art]]. A childhood friend of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], he played a major role in establishing the [[Federal Art Project]] (1935–43), which employed artists under the [[Works Progress Administration]].

==Biography==

===Education===
Born to an established Philadelphia family, Biddle attended the elite [[Groton School]] (where he was a classmate of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]).  He completed his undergraduate studies and later earned a law degree from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (1908 and 1911, respectively).  He passed his [[bar examination]] in Philadelphia.

Biddle's legal career was short-lived, however, and by the end of 1911 he had left the United States to study at the [[Académie Julian]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.incollect.com/artists/george-biddle incollect.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Paris]].  In the next two years he studied at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]].  Returning to Europe in 1914, Biddle spent time in [[Munich]] and [[Madrid]], studying printmaking in the Spanish capital, before trying his hand at [[impressionism]] in [[France]].  As he remembered, "I gobbled up museums, French Impressionism, cubism, futurism, and the old masters; I copied Velasquez in Madrid and Rubens in Munich…."&lt;ref name="pennigar"/&gt;  In 1917, with the United States' entry into the [[World War I|First World War]], Biddle enlisted in the [[United States Army|army]].

In the early interwar period Biddle continued his studies in far-flung locations such as [[Tahiti]], returned to France in 1924, and in 1928 went on a sketching trip through [[Mexico]] with [[Diego Rivera]].

===Career===
Prior to his Mexican travels, Biddle had returned to the United States in 1927 and established a printing shop in New York, where he "began to explore the variety and richness of technique and expressionism possible in lithography",&lt;ref name="pennigar"/&gt; a medium which he hoped would "popularize American art by making it better known to the American public".&lt;ref name="pennigar"/&gt;

In the 1930s, Biddle became a champion of social art and strongly advocated government funding for artistic endeavors. His correspondence with his former classmate (and recently elected president) Franklin Roosevelt&lt;ref name="ladis"&gt;[[Andrew Ladis|Ladis, Andrew]], [http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/5aa/5aa326.htm “George Biddle, Raphael Soyer, and the Genius with a Thousand Faces”] Traditional Fine Arts Organization 2005: 2-. Resource Library. March 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to the establishment of the [[Federal Art Project]],&lt;ref name="david"&gt;David Cook Fine Art [http://www.davidcookfineart.com/content.asp?contID=19 “George Biddle"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103101030/http://www.davidcookfineart.com/content.asp?contID=19 |date=2006-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an arm of the [[Works Progress Administration]] that produced several hundred thousand pieces of publicly funded art. Biddle himself completed a mural titled ''The Tenement'' for the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and made sketches of the opera [[Porgy and Bess]] during its late 1930s tour.  His works were exhibited at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].  During these years Biddle also wrote several books and taught at the [[Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center]]. Biddle was hired in 1940, along with eight other prominent American artists, to document dramatic scenes and characters during the production of the film ''[[The Long Voyage Home]]'', a cinematic adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's plays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenedscottarchive.com/hollywood/films/the-long-voyage-home.html "Cover Article, American Artist Magazine, September, 1940, pp. 4-14"]&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as President of the [[National Society of Mural Painters]] from 1935 to 1936.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalsocietyofmuralpainters.com&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Biddle was appointed chairman of the [[United States Department of War]]'s [[War Department Art Advisory Committee|Art Advisory Committee]] and served to recruit artists to that body.  Biddle himself traveled through [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Sicily]], and [[Italy]] with the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and produced works documenting that unit's activities.  He wrote a book on his war travels: Artist at War Tunisia-Sicily-Italy, Viking Press, 1944. When the Art Advisory Committee was disbanded, he produced combat art for [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;Chenoweth, Colonel H. Avery: ''Art of War: Eyewitness U.S. Combat Art from the Revolution through the Twentieth Century''. Barnes &amp; Noble, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7607-4828-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Biddle was appointed to the [[U.S. Commission of Fine Arts]], serving until 1951 and again from 1953 to 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Luebke, ed., ''Civic Art:  A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (Washington, D.C.:  U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2013):  Appendix B, p. 540.''&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Society Freed Through Justice''====
Biddle's best known work is in the mural ''Society Freed Through Justice'', five fresco panels in fifth-floor stairway of the [[Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building]] in Washington, D.C., produced under the U.S. Treasury Department's [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]]. At the time of Biddle's death in 1973, ''New York Times'' art critic [[John Canaday]] called the mural "the best he ever did. It depicted the everyday people of this country with extraordinary dignity, and it still stands up today."&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=November 8, 1973 |title=George Biddle, Artist, Is Dead; Muralist and Portraitist Was 88|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/08/archives/george-biddle-a-artist-is-dead-muralist-and-portraitist-was-88.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |location= |access-date=2018-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal===
George Biddle's brother was [[Francis Biddle]] (1886–1968), who was [[Attorney General of the United States]]. During Francis' tenure as the Attorney General, the new Department of Justice Building opened featuring murals painted by George that incorporated Francis' image in the "Life of the Law" mural.  George Biddle was married three times:
*Anne (''Nancy'') Coleman (b. 1896), married from 1917 to 1921
*Jane Belo (November 3, 1904 &amp;ndash; April 3, 1968) an anthropologist from [[Dallas, Texas]], to whom he was married from 1925 to 1929
*[[Hélène Sardeau]] (July 7, 1899 [[Antwerp]] (Belgium) &amp;ndash; 1969) a sculptor, to whom he was married from 1930 until her death. 
**Michael John Biddle (b. November 15, 1934).
George Biddle died on November 6, 1973, in [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York]].

==Style and influences==
Some factors that contributed to Biddle's artwork are the many art movements that he was involved in.  Biddle was involved in "French Impressionism; the American [[Ashcan School]]; the School of Paris and [[Cubism]] during those early and exciting days when it first exploded on the world; Regionalism, the Mexican Mural Movement, and the New Deal Subsidy of Art".&lt;ref name="biddle"&gt;Biddle, George. The Yes and No of Contemporary Art. London: Oxford University Press, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; He also was involved in the "post war currents of contemporary art".&lt;ref name="biddle"/&gt; Many of his works of art were contemporary.  Another factor that contributed to Biddle's artwork were his friendships with many great "painters, sculptors, and critics of the past generation and his life-long activity in behalf of fellow artists".&lt;ref name="biddle"/&gt;  He borrowed many of the other artists' styles and turned them into his own by using different techniques and images to get a different effect.  Biddle believed that everyone's life should be influenced by every "fact with which one comes in contact, until one ceases to grow or is, actually dead".&lt;ref name="pennigar"/&gt;  This is the reason why Biddle became such a successful American artist; he had his own style, and expressed real actual events.

A further influence on Biddle was [[Mary Cassatt]]. Biddle met Cassatt at the [[Académie Julian]] in [[Paris]]; she too was from Philadelphia. Cassatt helped to cultivate in Biddle an appreciation of the work of [[Degas]]. Some of Biddle's prints reflected "the style of these two artists in their intimate, domestic subject matter".&lt;ref name="pennigar"/&gt;

Biddle put in his "personal feelings&amp;mdash;affection, humor, compassion, irony, social outrage&amp;mdash;as well as his technical mastery of the lithographic medium" to "enliven his work".&lt;ref name="pennigar"&gt;Pennigar, Martha. The Graphic Work of George Biddle with [[Catalogue Raisonné]]. Baltimore, Maryland: Garamond/Pridemark Press, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

George Biddle achieved a lot of goals that helped other artists make their way.  His work serves as a "kind of index to the many style and themes which occupied artists in the first half of the 20th century".&lt;ref name="pennigar"/&gt; When Biddle volunteered to go to the war, it changed his whole life and how he saw the world. He got to travel the country and study the art of different cultures thus enriching the art that he would produce.  Biddle captured scenes and people how they naturally occurred in life. "Catfish Row" is a good example of Biddle capturing people and objects in their natural state. "Rejecting the stale formulas of academism and critical of what he saw as a loss of articulate emotional expressionism in much of modernist art, Biddle grappled with his own artistic identity throughout his life".&lt;ref name="pennigar"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1638">'''Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique''', commonly known as '''GERT''', is a [[network theory|network analysis]] technique used in [[project management]] that allows probabilistic treatment both network logic and estimation of activity duration. The technique was first described in 1966 by [[Alan Pritsker|Dr. Alan B. Pritsker]] of Purdue University and WW Happ.&lt;ref name=pritsker1966&gt;{{cite paper | author = [[Alan Pritsker|Pritsker, A.

Alan B. Pritsker, 2nd Edition, Wiley, 1979 {{ISBN|0-470-26648-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to other techniques, GERT is only rarely used in complex systems. Nevertheless, the GERT approach addresses the majority of the limitations associated with [[Program Evaluation and Review Technique|PERT]]/[[Critical path method|CPM]] technique. GERT allows loops between tasks. The fundamental drawback associated with the GERT technique is the complex programme ([[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulation]]) required to model the GERT system. Development in GERT includes Q-GERTS - allowing the user to consider queuing within the system.

'''Henry May Dawes''' (April 22, 1877 – September 29, 1952) was an [[Americans|American]] businessman and banker from a prominent [[Ohio]] family. He served as a [[United States]] [[Comptroller of the Currency]] from 1923 to 1924 and also worked as an executive in the oil industry.

Dawes was born in [[Marietta, Ohio]], the youngest son of [[American Civil War]] [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Rufus R. Dawes]] and great-great-grandson of [[American Revolution]] hero [[William Dawes]]. His brothers [[Charles Gates Dawes|Charles]], [[Rufus C. Dawes|Rufus]], and [[Beman Gates Dawes|Beman]] also gained national and international prominence in politics and business. Henry M. Dawes graduated from [[Marietta College]] and entered business. He married Helen Moore Curtis of [[Coshocton, Ohio]] in 1905.

Dawes was an Illinois banker and businessman when he was named Comptroller by President [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1923. Although he held office for only 19 months, Dawes carried out a nationwide effort to gather recommendations from national bank officials and other experts for changes in the banking laws. With the assistance of a volunteer committee of national bankers, Dawes drafted proposals that were submitted to Congress. The Dawes recommendations resulted in the [[McFadden Act]], enacted under his successor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occ.treas.gov/hdawes.htm Henry M. Dawes profile]. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Retrieved on 8 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawes returned to the oil industry after his term, as president of [[Pure Oil|Pure Oil Company]] from 1924–52. In 1936, along with other oil company executives, he was indicted and stood trial for violations of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. Acquitted, he resumed his civic duties, serving as Program Committee Chair for the Economic Club of Chicago from 1939 until 1940, as well as on its board of directors, along with his brother Rufus. He died on September 29, 1952 in Evanston, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1952/09/30/page/59/article/henry-m-dawes-dies-executive-of-oil-company&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Alfred Field''' (May 26, 1880 – July 16, 1927&lt;ref name="CC 1928"&gt;Frank Moore Colby, Allen Leon Churchill, Herbert Treadwell Wade (1928) ''The New international year book.'' p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American economist and Professor of Political Economy at the [[University of Chicago]], known as one of the proponents of [[institutional economics]]&lt;ref name="MR 2011 126-151"&gt;Malcolm Rutherford (2011). ''The Institutionalist Movement in American Economics.'' p. 126-151&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[demographer]], who contributed to the [[Demography|theory of population]] and its history.&lt;ref name="NEH 1913"/&gt;

== Life and work ==
Born in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], Field obtained his MS in economics at Harvard University in 1903, and continued to do post-graduate work at Harvard and at the [[University of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="CC 1928"/&gt;

Field started his academic career in 1903 as assistant in economics at Harvard University, and became Austin teaching fellow in economics for a year, and instructor in 1906 to 1908. From 1906 to 1908 he was also instructor in economics at Radcliffe College. In 1908 he started at the [[University of Chicago]] as instructor in economics, and was promoted assistant professor in 1910, associate professor in 1913, and full professor in 1918&lt;ref name="CC 1928"/&gt; until his death in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Rosanna Ledbetter (1976) ''A history of the Malthusian League, 1877-1927.'' p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 1923-24 he was also dean of the College of Arts and Literature.&lt;ref name="CC 1928"/&gt;

Filed was also known as founding president of the Illinois Birth Control League,&lt;ref&gt;''Population in Perspective,'' 1968, p. 448&lt;/ref&gt; and  associate editor of the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]],'' and during [[World War I]] was special investigator for the  [[Council of National Defense]] in its division of [[statistics]]. He was elected fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]].&lt;ref name="CC 1928"/&gt;

== Work ==
Field came into prominence in the years from 1913 to 1919, when he was involved with professor of Economics [[Leon C. Marshall]] and the economic historian [[Chester W. Wright]] in "attempts to move economics instruction away from the 'rigorous drill in orthodox theory' or the 'straight-jacket of conventional theory' to a method of instruction emphasizing the development of economic institutions, inquiry into current problems and issues, and fostering of creativity and originality (field 1917). To this end, they produced a book of readings to supplement the usual texts (Marshall, Wright, and Field 1913)."&lt;ref name="MR 2011 132"&gt;Malcolm Rutherford (2011). ''The Institutionalist Movement in American Economics.'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Essays on population, and other papers,'' 1931 ===
In a 1931 review of "Essays on population, and other papers" in ''The Eugenics Review'' [[Norman E. Himes]] (1899-1949), wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;THIS volume, by one of the greatest demographers America has produced, is a notable contribution to population thought and its history. An original, meticulously accurate scholar, Field has, unfortunately, been little known to European, and especially to Continental scholars. It is a great service, therefore, that one of his students should collect his more important scattered papers and notes, and edit them so ably. The solidity of the volume is matched by a felicity of literary presentation rarely found among economic writers; a combination especially refreshing in this day in America when, with growing numbers in our colleges, almost every underpaid professor becomes the hack author of a dull, poorly-written text-book.&lt;br&gt;The range of topics is wide. Part I contains twelve essays on eugenics, birth control, and Malthusianism, the treatment being essentially historical and critical. Part II collects three papers on economics and statistics, while Part III is a catalogue of the author's library on population. Since the Dictionary of American Biography has failed to include the career of Field, it is fitting that the editor has added a short biography together with a distinctive photograph of the author.&lt;ref name="NEH 1913"&gt;Himes, Norman E. "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2985062/pdf/eugenrev00304-0065.pdf Essays on population and other papers by James Alfred Field, together with material from his notes and lectures compiled and edited by Helen Fisher Hohman, with a foreword by James Bonar, LL. D.]" ''The Eugenics Review'' 23.3 (1931): 258-261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And more specific about its content:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have always felt-perhaps there is a personal bias-that Essay III on "The Early Propagandist Movement in English Population Theory" was the best paper Field ever published. I know of no finer example of historico-economic research in the English language, no matter what tests are applied. Though Professor [[Graham Wallas]] deserves credit also, it is not an ungenerous distinction to say that Field was the first scholar to appraise in full measure [[Francis Place]]'s efforts for birth control at the beginning of the last century. Much of the Place correspondence which Dr. Stopes has upon various occasions claimed to have " discovered " was known to, and used by, Field.&lt;br&gt;Essays IV, V, and IX are specifically on eugenics. They are Galtonian in idealism; but the author is mindful of the numerous difficulties. The article reprinted from the Quarterly Journal of Economics is an excellent historical and critical review of euge-nical literature produced up to the time of
publication (1911). Regrettably, the author never followed it up.&lt;ref name="NEH 1913"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''James Buchanan, 1st Baron Woolavington''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCVO|JP}} (16 August 1849 – 9 August 1935), known as '''Sir James Buchanan, Bt''', from 1920 to 1922, was a British businessman, [[philanthropist]], and racehorse owner and breeder.

==Early life==
Buchanan was born in [[Brockville, Ontario]], Canada, the third and youngest son of Alexander Buchanan and his wife Catherine (née McLean),&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p6279.htm#i62782 thepeerage.com James Buchanan, 1st and last Baron Woolavington]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants, but his parents returned to the United Kingdom shortly after he was born and he was brought up in [[Larne]], where his father worked as a [[quarry]] manager. Due to ill health as a child, he was educated privately.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{Cite ODNB |id=32151 |title=Buchanan, James, Baron Woolavington (1849–1935) |last=Weir |first=Ronald B. |year=2011 |origyear=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Buchanan joined William Sloan &amp; Co, a [[Glasgow]] shipping firm, as an office boy when he was fourteen or fifteen, and was later promoted to be a clerk. In 1868, he joined his brother William in his [[grain]] business, also in Glasgow. In November 1879, he moved to [[London]] as an agent for the [[Leith]] whisky blenders Charles Mackinlay &amp; Co.

He realised that there was an untapped market in [[England]] for bottled [[Scotch whisky]] and set about producing his own, the ''[[Buchanan's|Buchanan Blend]]'', which is still available today. He went into business on his own in 1884. Buchanan did not, however, produce his own whisky. It was produced for him by the Glasgow blenders W. P. Lowrie &amp; Co.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; Marketed in distinctive black bottles with plain white labels, it was commonly known as "[[Black &amp; White (whisky)|black and white whisky]]", a name that was eventually actually used on the label.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; By 1903, when his firm was incorporated as a [[private limited company]], Buchanan was worth £750,000.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; By 1909, Buchanans was the best-selling Scotch in England.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He supplied whisky to the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] from 1885.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; In 1898, he received [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrants]] to supply [[Queen Victoria]], the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]], and the [[George V|Duke of York]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; Buchanan opened a Paris office in 1902 and a New York office shortly afterwards. In 1898 he opened [[Glentauchers]] [[malt whisky]] distillery on [[Strathspey, Scotland|Speyside]] and later acquired two more distilleries.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; In 1906, he bought Lowrie's and rapidly mechanised their production facilities in Glasgow.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; In 1907, he acquired an interest in the North British Bottle Manufacturing Company and purchased the Acme Tea Chest Company, both to aid his business. Both were rapidly mechanised.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He was a master of publicity, driving a red-wheeled [[horse and buggy|buggy]] pulled by a black pony and accompanied by a liveried [[footman]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

In 1909, Buchanan proposed a merger between the "big three" whisky firms: Buchanan's, [[Dewar's]], and [[Johnnie Walker|Walker's]]. This, however, was not successful.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He tried again in 1914, and in April 1915 Buchanan's and Dewar's formed a joint holding company, Scotch Whisky Brands Ltd, renamed Buchanan Dewar Ltd in 1919.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; In 1925, the "big three" merged with the [[Distillers Company]]. Buchanan was a director, but his age and failing health (he had never been in the best of health) meant he played little part in the company, attending only a single board meeting.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

==Other interests==
Buchanan was vice-president of the [[Tariff Reform League]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He owned properties in [[Kenya]] and [[Argentina]] and part-owned, with [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Lord Aberdeen]], a 20,000-acre fruit farm in [[British Columbia]], Canada. He was appointed [[High Sheriff of Sussex]] in 1910.

He spent much of his wealth on philanthropic projects. He bought the [[logbook]] of [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']] and presented it to the [[British Museum]], financed the fitting out of [[HMS Implacable (1805)|HMS ''Implacable'']] as a [[training ship]], and donated  £125,000 to fund a wing at [[Middlesex Hospital]] in 1928 in honour of his late wife, £50,000 to restore the [[nave]] of [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]], £10,000 to the [[University of Edinburgh]] to fund animal breeding research (later receiving an honorary [[Doctorate of Laws]]), £10,000 to fund a [[hospital#Departments|ward]] at the [[London Hospital]], £5,000 to the [[West of Scotland Agricultural College]], £2,500 to the [[Licensed Victuallers' School]], and £2,500 to the Licensed Victuallers' Benevolent Institution.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

===Thoroughbred racing===
For more than two decades, Woolavington was a significant owner/breeder in the sport of [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing]] who twice won [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] and [[St. Leger Stakes]]. Among his best known runners were [[Epsom Lad]], [[Hurry On]], who became the foundation sire for his [[stud farm|stud]], [[Captain Cuttle]], [[Coronach (horse)|Coronach]], [[Press Gang (horse)|Press Gang]], and [[Coventry Stakes]] winner [[Manitoba (horse)|Manitoba]] who went on to become the [[leading sire in Australia]] in 1944 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.horseracinghistory.co.uk/hrho/action/viewDocument?id=928 |title=Woolavington, James (1st Baron) (1849–1935) |publisher=The National Horseracing Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; He set up a [[stud farm]] at his [[Sussex]] estate, [[Lavington Park]], near [[Petworth]], which he had bought in 1903.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He was elected to the [[Jockey Club]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He also bred pedigree cattle and sheep.

==Honours==
Buchanan was created a [[baronet]], of Lavington in the County of Sussex, in the 1920 New Year Honours,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31830 |date=19 March 1920 |page=3432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for "public and local services"&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31712 |date=30 December 1919 |page=2 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was raised to the [[peerage]] in the [[1922 New Year Honours]] as '''Baron Woolavington''', of Lavington, in the County of Sussex,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=32598 |date=3 February 1922 |page=954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for being a "generous supporter of many public and charitable objects".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32563 |date=30 December 1921 |page=10709 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is said that he paid £50,000 for his peerage, signing the cheque "Woolavington" and dating it 2 January &amp;ndash; the day after the title was to be gazetted &amp;ndash; so that the payment would [[non-sufficient funds|bounce]] if he did not receive the honour he had been promised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1519047/Was-this-the-richest-and-most-secretive-British-tycoon-ever.html |title=Was this the richest (and most secretive) British tycoon ever? |first=Ben |last=Fenton |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=22 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed [[Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order]] (GCVO) in the [[1931 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33675 |date=30 December 1930 |page=7 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and personal life==
On 5 December 1891, Buchanan married a young widow thirteen years his junior, Annie Eliza Bardolph (née Pounder). Annie already had a son and a daughter;&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; together the couple had a daughter, the Honourable Catherine Buchanan, and a son who died in infancy.&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"/&gt; Annie was a nurse and worked in London hospitals during the First World War. She died suddenly in October 1918.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; The peerage and baronetcy became extinct on Woolavington's death at Lavington Park in August 1935, aged 85. He left an estate worth over £7 million and was buried in the nearby churchyard of [[Graffham]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6154">'''José M. Berrocal''' (1957 &amp;ndash; October 25, 2000) was the youngest president of [[Puerto Rico Government Development Bank]] (1991–1992).

== Early years; Education ==

Berrocal was born in 1957 in Puerto Rico.

He graduated in 1975 from the Academia del Perpetuo Socorro in Miramar, PR, where he distinguished himself as president of the student council and the Model United Nations Club of PR. An accomplished debater, he championed Perpetuo's Model UN team to first place at the Washington, DC nationals. In 1979, Berrocal graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] with a [[Bachelor's degree]] from [[Princeton University]]'s [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]].&lt;ref name=PAW&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2007-06-10

|title= Memorials - José M. Berrocal '79
|work=Princeton Alumni Weekly|date=April 10, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this with studies as a [[Marshall Scholar]] at [[Oxford University]], and then the study of law at [[Yale University]], where he was an editor at the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''.

== Public service ==

After serving for several years as Legal Counselor to [[Governor of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico Governor]] [[Rafael Hernández Colón]], Berrocal was chosen to serve as president of the [[Puerto Rico Government Development Bank]], the fiscal agent of the Government of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=GDBpresidents&gt;

 |deadurl=yes 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of his selection, he became the youngest president in the history of the bank.

During his years in public service, Berrocal was also the Governor's designee in the years-long negotiations led by the [[United States Senate]] Energy Committee Chairman [[J. Bennett Johnston]], D-La, on Puerto Rico's political status, representing the status quo.  He also mentored numerous young professionals working in government, some of whom were humorously called "berrocalitos" (or mini-Berrocal's) in his honor.

In 1991, it was rumored that Governor Hernández Colón intended to appoint Berrocal as an Associate Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Puerto Rico]], according to a recent history of the Supreme Court (La justicia en sus manos-2007).

== Professional life ==

Subsequent to his stint in government, Berrocal became managing director of Wolfensohn (later acquired by [[Bankers Trust]], then [[Deutsche Bank]], where he worked closely with [[Federal Reserve Bank]] chairman [[Paul Volcker]].  Prominent businesses in and out of Puerto Rico sought him out as a consultant.

== Final illness ==

Berrocal's close Princeton classmate, [[Bill Ford]], found out that he was seriously ill with a rare disease, [[thymus|thymic]] [[cancer]].  After visiting him in Puerto Rico, Ford sent a plane to fly his friend to the [[Henry Ford Hospital]] in Michigan, where a new chemotherapy treatment was applied, to no avail.  On October 25, 2000, Berrocal died with his family and Bill Ford at his bedside.

== Memorials ==

On December 7, 2001,  Bill Ford and the [[Ford Motor Company]] announced the creation of the [[José M. Berrocal Scholarship for Environmental Studies]] &amp;mdash; $10,000 scholarships to assist graduate students studying environmental disciplines in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=FordPress&gt;{{cite web

On May 13, 2002, the Government Development Bank announced the creation of the José M.

The '''Liberty Tower''', formerly the '''Sinclair Oil Building''', is located at 55 [[Liberty Street (Manhattan)|Liberty Street]] at the corner of [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]], New York City was built in 1909–10 as a commercial office building and was designed by Chicago architect [[Henry Ives Cobb]] in a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]]. It was built on a site adjacent to the New York City [[Chamber of Commerce Building (New York City)|Chamber of Commerce Building]] (1901); the subsequent New York Federal Reserve Bank building was constructed to the east, across Nassau Street, in 1922. A completely free-standing 33-story building, in 1909 Liberty Tower was the tallest building in the world with such a small footprint. The limestone building is covered in white [[architectural terracotta]] ornamented with birds and alligators and other fanciful subjects.&lt;ref name="nycland"&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aia"&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Before its construction in 1909, a prior building on the same site housed the offices of the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'' under editor [[William Cullen Bryant]], and served as the first headquarters of the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], established by [[Henry Bergh]] in 1867.

President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s law office was one of its first commercial tenants after the building opened in 1910. In 1917, an office was leased as cover for German spies seeking to prevent America's intervention in World War I (then called "The Great War"). The plot involved an attempt to draw the United States into a diversionary war with Mexico and Japan. The plot was exposed on March 1, 1917, with news reports of an intercepted telegram decoded by British cryptographers, the notorious "[[Zimmermann Telegram]]", which prompted President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to [[American entry into World War I|declare war against Germany]] a month later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Tuchman]],  ''The Zimmermann Telegram'', 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterward, the entire building was leased by the [[Sinclair Oil]] Company, responsible for the [[Teapot Dome scandal]] of 1922. Prior to the 1974 [[Watergate scandal]], this was called "the most sensational scandal in the history of American politics," and became the most enduring legacy of [[Warren G. Harding]]'s troubled presidency.

In 1979, the structure, renamed Liberty Tower, was converted from commercial use into a residential building, one of the first such conversions in Manhattan south of Canal Street, by architect [[Joseph Pell Lombardi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.josephpelllombardi.com/projects/libertytower.html Joseph Pell Lombardi Architects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403232959/http://www.josephpelllombardi.com/projects/libertytower.html |date=2009-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designated a [[New York City landmark]] in 1982, and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on September 15, 1983.

Because the then new principles of "[[skyscraper]]" design were not yet fully understood, the building was overbuilt, with its steel foundation anchored deeply into bedrock five stories below street level. This overly sturdy construction helped this tall, slender building withstand the collapse of two World Trade Towers only 220 yards (201 m) to the west on [[September 11, 2001]], with only minimal damage despite the impact which was measured at the time as a 3.3 magnitude seismic event.

A restoration of the building was undertaken from 2007 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/realestate/04liberty.html|title=Liberty Tower: A Storied Skyscraper With Much to Celebrate|last=Arieff|first=Irwin|date=April 2, 2010|website=nytimes.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Algerian chain Ardis (owned by Algerian group [[Arcofina]]) is currently operating one hypermarket in the country in [[Mohammedia, Algiers|Mohammedia]] just outside [[Algiers]].

A '''local authority trading enterprise''' ('''LATE''') was an organisation established in [[New Zealand]] under the [[Local Government Act 1974 (New Zealand)|Local Government Act 1974]].

The 1989 legislation assigned regional councils planning and funding responsibilities, but not the transport supplier function. It required [[Regions of New Zealand|regional councils]] or other territorial authorities either to divest their transport assets to the [[private sector]], or to establish a transport-related local authority trading enterprise.

Local authority trading enterprises were replaced by [[council-controlled organisation]]s under the [[Local Government Act 2002 (New Zealand)|Local Government Act 2002]].

The '''Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award''' recognizes U.S. organizations in the business, health care, education, and nonprofit sectors for performance excellence. The Baldrige Award is the only formal recognition of the performance excellence of both public and private U.S. organizations given by the [[President of the United States]]. It is administered by the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program, which is based at and managed by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), an agency of the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]]. 

Up to 18 awards may be given annually across six eligibility categories—manufacturing, service, small business, education, health care, and nonprofit. As of 2016, 113 awards have been presented to 106 organizations (including seven repeat winners).&lt;ref name="2016 Announcement"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2016/11/four-us-organizations-receive-nations-highest-honor-performance-excellence Four U.S. Organizations Receive Nation’s Highest Honor for Performance Excellence]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baldrige Performance Excellence Program and the associated award were established by the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Improvement Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–107). The program and award were named for [[Howard M. Baldrige, Jr.|Malcolm Baldrige]], who served as [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] during the Reagan administration, from 1981 until Baldrige’s 1987 death in a [[rodeo]] accident. In 2010, the program's name was changed to the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/baldrige_100510.cfm Baldrige Program Name Change Emphasizes Performance Excellence]," 10/5/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The award is not given for specific products or services.

== Baldrige Excellence Framework ==
The Baldrige Excellence Framework has three parts: (1) the criteria for performance excellence, (2) core values and concepts, and (3) scoring guidelines. The framework serves two main purposes: (1) to help organizations assess their improvement efforts, diagnose their overall performance management system, and identify their strengths and opportunities for improvement and (2) to identify Baldrige Award recipients that will serve as role models for other organizations.

The criteria for performance excellence are based on a set of core values:
* Systems perspective
* [[Visionary]] [[leadership]]
* [[Customer relationship management|Customer-focused]] excellence
* [[Value network|Valuing people]]
* [[Organizational learning]] and agility
* Focus on success
* Managing for [[innovation]]
* [[total quality management|Management by fact]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/management-by-fact.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Social responsibility|Societal responsibility]]
* [[business ethics|Ethics]] and transparency
* Delivering value and results

The questions that make up the criteria represent seven aspects of organizational management and performance:
* Leadership
* [[Business strategy|Strategy]]
* Customers
* Measurement, analysis, and [[knowledge management]]
* Workforce
* Operations
* Results

The three sector-specific versions of the Baldrige framework are revised every two years:
* Baldrige Excellence Framework (Business/Nonprofit)
* Baldrige Excellence Framework (Education)
* Baldrige Excellence Framework (Health Care)

==History of the Baldrige Program==
In the early and mid-1980s, many U.S. industry and government leaders saw that a renewed emphasis on [[quality (business)|quality]] was necessary for doing business in an expanding and competitive [[market (economics)|world market]].

The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Improvement Act of 1987, signed into law on August 20, 1987, was developed through the actions of the National Productivity Advisory Committee, chaired by [[C. Jackson Grayson|Jack Grayson]]. The nonprofit research organization APQC, founded by Grayson, organized the first White House Conference on Productivity, spearheading the creation of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1987. The Baldrige Award was envisioned as a standard of excellence that would help U.S. organizations achieve competitive quality.

In the late summer and fall of 1987, Dr. Curt Reimann, the first director of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Program, and his staff at the National Institute of Standards and Technology developed an award implementation framework, including an evaluation scheme, and advanced proposals for what is now the Baldrige Award. In its first three years, the Baldrige Award was jointly administered by APQC and the [[American Society for Quality]], which continues to assist in administering the award program under contract to NIST.

==Program Impacts==

* The ratio of Baldrige Program benefits for the [[U.S. economy]] to program costs has been estimated at 820 to 1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/economic_evaluation_2011.cfm|title=Economic Evaluation of the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program December 2011|last=NIST|first=US Department of Commerce,|website=www.nist.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 109 Baldrige Award recipients (including 7 two-time winners).
* Median growth in revenue for two-time Baldrige Award winners is 92%. 
* Median job growth for two-time Baldrige Award winners is 63% (compared with 2.5% for a matched set of industries and time periods).
* 2010–2015 Baldrige Award applicants represent 567,434 jobs, over $142 billion in revenue/budgets, and about 449 million customers served.
* The value of services donated by 349 national Baldrige examiners in 2015 is $5.3 million.
* The value of services donated by state Baldrige-based examiners in 2015 is $30 million.
A study by [[Truven Health Analytics]] links hospitals that adopt and use the Baldrige Criteria to successful operations, management practices, and overall performance.
* 65% of hospitals are likely to “use the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence as a systematic framework for performance improvement or as an internal assessment tool” by 2018, according to survey results reported in ''Futurescan 2013''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/upload/Futurescan-2013-p44-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to the same survey, 41% of hospitals are likely to submit an application for the Baldrige Award or a state-level Baldrige-based award by 2018.

==Public-Private Partnership==
The Baldrige Award is supported by a [[public-private partnership]]. The following organizations and entities play a key role:
* The Foundation for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award raises funds to permanently endow the award program.
* The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, manages the Baldrige Program.
* The [[American Society for Quality]] (ASQ) assists in administering the award program under contract to NIST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/malcolm-baldrige-award/overview/overview.html | title=Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) | publisher=ASQ | accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JTMI"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-27242009000100012 | title=Measuring Excellence: A Closer Look at Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Winners in the Manufacturing Category | author=Brian Cazzell, Jeffrey M.

* The Board of Overseers advises the Department of Commerce on the Baldrige Program.
* Members of the Board of Examiners—consisting of leading experts from U.S. businesses and education, health care, and nonprofit organizations—volunteer their time to evaluate award applications and prepare feedback reports for applicant organizations. Board members also share information about the program in their professional, trade, community, and state organizations. The Panel of Judges, part of the Board of Examiners, makes award recommendations to the director of NIST.
* The network of state, regional, and local Baldrige-based award programs known as the Alliance for Performance Excellence provides potential award applicants and examiners, promotes the use of the Criteria, and disseminates information on the award process and concepts.

Its sheer walls and flat roof were a departure from designs of previous buildings topped by step-backs, mansard roofs, or towers. It was developed by G. Livingston and Sidney E. Morse, nephews of telegraph inventor [[Samuel F. B. Morse]]. The building was designated a [[New York City landmark]] in September, 2006.&lt;ref name="NYCLPC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/2006Morse.pdf |title=Morse Building |work=Landmarks Preservation Commission |date=September 19, 2006 |accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The site of the Morse Building, at the northeast corner of Nassau and Beekman Streets, was the location where Christian newspaper ''The New-York Observer'' was published from 1840 to 1859. The architectural firm, Silliman &amp; Farnsworth, filed for the construction of the eight-story building, including a raised basement and an attic. Construction began in June 1878 and was completed in March 1880. Upon its completion, the owners claimed that the Morse Building was “the tallest straight wall building in the world." Interior amenities included 175 offices, two hydraulic [[Otis elevators]], steam heat, gas lighting, and fireplaces.&lt;ref name="NYCLPC"/&gt;

The base of the Morse Building was damaged in a January 1882 fire that destroyed the [[New York World Building]]. From 1896 to 1900, the Morse Building was the site of the office and rooftop studio of one of the earliest American motion picture companies, which became the [[Vitagraph Company of America]] founded by [[J. Stuart Blackton]] and [[Albert E. Smith (producer)|Abert E. Smith]].&lt;ref name="NYCLPC"/&gt;

==Description==
The Morse Building's design was marked three periods of construction: the original (1878–80), as well as alterations in 1901-02 and c. 1965. Today, the structure’s 6-story midsection, with two articulated facades featuring round- and segmental-arched fenestration, is, in part, the earliest surviving tall “fireproof” New York office building of the period prior to the full development of the
skyscraper.&lt;ref name="NYCLPC"/&gt;

The building was designed in with [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian Gothic]], [[Neo-Grec]], and [[Rundbogenstil]] influences. It is an early example of the use of brick and [[terra cotta]] for the exterior cladding of office buildings constructed during that time period. The intricate [[polychrome brickwork]] was supplied by the Peerless Brick Company of [[Philadelphia]]. It features hues of deep red and glazed black, the latter employed ornamentally, largely to emphasize the outlines of the [[fenestration (architecture)|fenestration]]. The terra cotta was manufactured by the Boston Terra Cotta Co., one of
the first East Coast firms.&lt;ref name="NYCLPC"/&gt;

The building was significantly altered in 1901-02 to an [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] [[Neo-Classical architecture|Neo-Classical]] style, designed by of architects Bannister &amp; Schell. The renovations included remodeling the base; reconstructing the upper two stories, capped by a projecting balcony/cornice supported by large [[Bracket (architecture)|scroll brackets]]; and adding four steel-framed stories clad in cream-colored brick, bringing it to 14 stories. The building's base was altered again around 1965, removing the 10th-story balcony/cornice. The building was converted from commercial to residential use in 1980. One-over-one double-hung wood-framed windows (with [[Transom (architectural)|transoms]] in the round arches) were replaced in 1986 with [[anodized aluminum]] windows (except for the 8th story, which are mostly wood).&lt;ref name="NYCLPC"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2664">A '''new chemical entity''' ('''NCE''') is, according to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]], a [[drug]] that contains no active [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] that has been approved by the FDA in any other application submitted under section 505(b) of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm118696.pdf。&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''new molecular entity''' ('''NME''') is a drug that contains an active moiety that has never been approved by the FDA or marketed in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdalawblog.net/fda_law_blog_hyman_phelps/2009/09/hatchwaxman-25th-anniversary-quiz-the-answers-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
An active moiety is a [[molecule]] or [[ion]], excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an [[ester]], [[salt]] (including a salt with [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen]] or [[coordination bond]]s), or other [[noncovalent]] derivative (such as a [[Coordination complex|complex]], [[chelate]], or [[clathrate]]) of the molecule, responsible for the [[physiological]] or [[pharmacological]] action of the drug substance.

An NCE is a [[molecule]] developed by the innovator company in the early [[drug discovery]] stage, which after undergoing [[clinical trials]] could translate into a drug that could be a treatment for some disease. [[Chemical synthesis|Synthesis]] of an NCE is the first step in the process of [[drug development]]. Once the synthesis of the NCE has been completed, companies have two options before them. They can either go for clinical trials on their own or license the NCE to another company. In the latter option, companies can avoid the expensive and lengthy process of clinical trials, as the licensee company would be conducting further clinical trials and subsequently launching the drug. Companies adopting this model of business would be able to generate high margins as they get a huge one-time payment for the NCE as well as entering into a revenue sharing agreement with the licensee company.

Under the [[Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007]], all new chemical entities must first be reviewed by an advisory committee before the FDA can approve these products.

The '''Optical Storage Technology Association''' (OSTA) is an international [[trade association]] which promotes the use of recordable optical technologies and products, and most notably it is responsible for the creation and maintenance of the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] specification. Representing more than 85 percent of worldwide writable optical product shipment's manufacturers and resellers, it was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1992.

In the autumn of 2007, OSTA spearheaded a campaign to encourage families and photographers to back up their digital photographs on compact discs. Since it is estimated that one out of seven computer hard drives "crash" within the first year,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} OSTA believes it is dangerous to merely rely on storing irreplaceable pictures on a hard drive alone.

==Career==
Bloomfield was involved with a string of high-profile deals during the 1980s and was known as the man that sourced the deals that made [[Tony Clegg (businessman)|Tony Clegg]]'s [[Mountleigh]] a stock market favourite in 1986-87.
 
In 1989, it emerged that he was the joint owner of the [[Alton Towers]] theme park and a leisure venture at [[Battersea Power Station]] after he formed a joint venture, Alton International, with David Broome of Alton Group who was struggling to complete the Battersea project.&lt;ref&gt;"Bloomfield Emerges as Co-owner of Alton Group", Paul Cheeseright, ''[[The Financial Times]]'', 31 May 1989, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Servicios Industriales de la Marina S.A.''' (Shipyard Marine Industrial Services), well known as '''SIMA''' or '''SIMA PERU S.A.''', is a Peruvian [[shipyard]] that operates as a state owned company established under private law in 1950 pursuing the activities of the former Naval Factory founded in 1845, and continually extending its operational capacity, first to the shipbuilding which SIMA pioneered in [[South America]] and then to the greatest metalworking structures manufacture, contributing to the defense and socio-economic development of Peru. The SIMA principally serve the [[Navy of Peru]] as well as domestic and foreign private clients through a wide range of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sima.com.pe/ace_empresa_eng.asp|title=SIMA, the company|publisher=sima.com.pe|date=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On May 22, 1845 during the first government of President [[Ramón Castilla]], the State Factory in the city of [[Callao]] was established. Then named Naval Factory, this facility would become a leading establishment of its kind in South America. Such decision to establish this factory was due to the fact that Peru had taken steps to acquire the steamship "Rimac", first steam warship of the national navy at that time in the year of 1844, making it necessary to have an establishment where maintenance and repair could be provided.&lt;ref name=pt1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sima.com.pe/ace_historia_eng.asp|title=History´s SIMA|publisher=sima.com.pe|date=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BAP Humboldt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[B.I.C. Humboldt]], Peruvian oceanographic research vessel built in 1978 by SIMA.]]
On August 7, 1861 by orders of the President of the Republic, General Juan Antonio Pezet, the Naval Factory was entirely taken over by the Navy, arranging the creation of the Naval Factory Superintendence, thus achieving performance optimization. Years later the Naval Factory made history participating in the construction of the first South American armored ship monitor "Victoria" and the conversion of steamship "Loa" into an armored vehicle; installing machinery, artillery and hull armor. Both ships were part of the national fleet that confronted the Spanish fleet during the naval [[Battle of Callao]] in 1866.&lt;ref name=pt1/&gt;

During the [[War of the Pacific|Pacific War]] the Naval Factory was actively engaged in the national efforts to confront the military conflict meeting the requirements of both the Navy and the Army. Unfortunately, at the end of the war, its facilities were destroyed after heroic efforts of men to serve even under the most difficult circumstances, thereby constituting the oldest record of what SIMA is today.&lt;ref name=pt1/&gt;

In the post war years, few of the ships possessed by the Navy were repaired in the state-owned floating dock of the "Compañía Peruana de Vapores y Dique del Callao" until 1930, date on winch it sank, forcing the Navy to send its ships to the Panama Canal zone, among other foreign shipyards.&lt;ref name=pt1/&gt;
[[File:BAP Mariategui Panamax 2004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[BAP Mariátegui (FM-54)|BAP Mariátegui]], frigate built in 1984 by SIMA.]]
In a situation of dependence on foreign shipyards, the Navy of Peru took up again naval repair activities to serve their small-sized vessels, creating the Naval Station of San Lorenzo in 1921. In 1925, with the arrival of submarines Type "R", the Naval Station of San Lorenzo was modernized installing machinery at the workshops and a modern shipyard with capacity of 800 tns bollard pull, inaugurated with the entry of torpedo-boat destroyer "Rodriguez".&lt;ref name=pt1/&gt;

On February 14, 1950 during the government of [[Manuel A. Odría]], Servicios Industriales de la Marina (Marine Industrial Services) known as SIMA was created over the base of the Industrial Department of the Navy Dockyard, assigning the dry dock administration and workshops in order to serve the Peruvian Navy, the National Merchant Marine and private entities successfully. With creation of SIMA under administration of the Navy, the decision to get into the shipbuilding activity was made. Preparation of the shipyard for that purpose began. Berth number one, mould-loft, shipbuilding workshop among others were constructed.&lt;ref name=pt1/&gt;

On March, 25th 1999 Law N° 27073 was enacted, regulating activities of the company within the scope of the defense sector and paying particular attention to the Navy of Peru as well as individuals customers in order to generate profits to self-finance its own development and fulfill its role in society.&lt;ref name=pt1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1828">Within the context of [[international trade]], a '''social clause''' is the integration of seven core [[ILO]] [[labour rights]] conventions into trade agreements.

==Background==
Core labour standards would be inserted into an article within the [[WTO]] Agreements which could be a more viable option than amendment of the Agreements themselves. If a [[member state]] violated the social clause, the breach could become subject to WTO scrutiny, through the usual WTO dispute settlement provisions (provided provision is made for this when inserting a social clause). As a result of dispute settlement proceedings, the DSB could, at the request of the complaining party, recommend that retaliatory trade measures be taken against the offending country.

'''Social partners''' are groups that cooperate in working relationships to achieve a mutually agreed upon goal, typically to the benefit of all involved groups. Examples of social partners include employers, employees, trade unions, government, etc.

== Origin ==
The concept of social partners arose in Europe in part from the disorder following the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Article 152 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (TFEU) states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Union recognizes and promotes the role of the social partners at its level, taking into account the diversity of national systems. It shall facilitate dialogue between the social partners, respecting their autonomy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This article forms part of the [[European Union law|Primary Law]] of the European Union (EU).

== Role of social partners ==
Social partners have a vital role to play in reaching out to workers and owners of enterprises and in particular those of SMEs and the informal economy, and in general, increasing the representation of their membership to ensure deeper and broader benefits of association, representation and leadership, including in the field of public policy advocacy, its formulation and implementation.

== Process ==
With the approaching of globalization, companies must bear more pressure from the competitive between countries, more issues coming up such as the environment issue, the society problem and the income distribution problem after the globalization.

At the same time, new technology had replaced the status of traditional industries that cause structural unemployment to amount of the Low-skill labors.

Also the relationship between employee and employer becomes more complicated as the atypical employment turns into mainstream in the employment market. Because of these circumstances, the relationship between labor and employer has become more like partners. And this new idea of social partners had taken shape through the International Labor Organization (ILO1) and Europe social partnership system.

But there are quite few research and example about social partners in the US，the reason is that noun ”social partner” come up after WW2, that made European understand the importance of peace in every way, this new concept helped Europe rebuild the economy after the damage of war.

There is an inextricable connection between social partners and social dialogue, but what makes a good social dialogue?
# Powerful and independent organization of labor and employer
# Both employee and employer have the willing to talk equally
# Respect the freedom of association and the collective bargaining
# Appropriate institutional support

== Influence ==
The Treaty of Lisbon (Article 152 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU) recognises the role of the social partners in labour relations and European social dialogue. They represent their members during consultations with the Commission and the negotiation of collective agreements. They also sit with the European Economic and Social Committee, alongside other organisations representing civil society. The social partners play a key role in implementing the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, by launching projects and initiatives at European and national level.

European social partners have had a considerable influence on the preparation of the following Commission proposals:
* Revamping the rules to protect EU workers from harmful electromagnetic fields;
* The new framework Directive on the establishment of the European Works Councils;
* The Directive implementing the revised Framework Agreement on parental leave;
* The recommendation on a smoke-free environment

== Examples in action ==

=== Poland ===
The role of governments and social partners in keeping older workers in the labour market. In view of Poland’s ranking as lowest in the EU professional activity indicators for people aged 45+, the government and social partners see the need for actions boosting occupational development of this group. Poland has a universal plan called ‘Generations’ Solidarity: Actions for Increasing Occupational Activity of People Aged 50+’, developed within the social dialogue institutions. So far it has been implemented through legislation, most importantly with regard to the pension system, and specifically raising and equalising the statutory retirement age for men and women and restricting access to early retirement schemes. Very few actions revolve around improving the quality of work of older workers.

=== Korea === 
Labor Foundation, which was founded in April 2007 under the tripartite consensus on the importance of social partners' autonomous contribution to a more stable and advanced labor relations, is one and the only public institution that is engaged in the programs and activities to promote the labor relations in Korea. The programs and activities of the Foundation, which are all designed to help and guide social partners to work together with responsibility and for their common benefits, include: financial assistance for social partnership education and joint programs; workplace innovation consulting to increase competitiveness at workplace; employment generation, by creating selective worktime jobs, improving the long work practice and promoting flexible work schemes; outplacement services for retirees in their 40s or older; counseling and education to prevent and remedy unreasonable discrimination in employment; and international exchanges in the field of labor relations.

From 2011 to 2012, the FELPLP worked on the initiative '''Forum for the Development of the Department of La Paz''', A partnership with government entities, foundations, and other organizations to undertake and design actions to articulate all different levels of government and public entities, and to prioritize actions that would lead to the development of La Paz. The main participants were: the Association of Organizations of Ecological Producers of Bolivia (la Asociación de Organizaciones de Productores Ecológicos de Bolivia, AOPEB), the Joint Committee of Campesino Economic Organizations (Coordinadora Integral de Organizaciones Económicas Campesinas, CIOEC), the Federation of Private Entrepreneurs of La Paz (FEPLP), the government of La Paz, the Jubilee Foundation, the [[University of San Andrés]] (Universidad de San Andrés), and the Autonomous Government of the Municipality of La Paz (Gobierno Autónomo Municipal de La Paz, GAMLP),). The FEPLP then coordinated roundtables to further discuss the topics concluded at the Forum. The priority areas taken into consideration were energy, tourism, textiles, water, organic food production, and the importance of improving productive supply chains.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Some of the sponsors of the Forum were the Embassy of Denmark, PNUD Art Bolivia, Al Invest IV Region Andina, and National Chamber of Commerce, Bolivia.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. The word count for a plot is usually 400-700 words. --&gt;
In October 2003, 19-year-old [[Harvard University]] student [[Mark Zuckerberg]] is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting entry about Albright on his [[LiveJournal]] blog and then creates a campus website called [[Facemash]] by hacking into college databases to steal photos of female students, then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard's computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of [[Disciplinary probation|academic probation]]. However, Facemash's popularity attracts the attention of Harvard upperclassmen and twins [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]] and their business partner [[Divya Narendra]]. The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on [[Harvard Connection]], a social network featuring the exclusive nature of Harvard students and aimed at dating.

After agreeing to work on the Winklevoss twins' concept, Zuckerberg approaches his friend [[Eduardo Saverin]] with an idea for what he calls ''Thefacebook''&lt;!--the original name and spelling--&gt;, an online social networking website that would be exclusive to [[Ivy League]] students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Mark to build the website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of ''Thefacebook'', the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while keeping them deliberately in the dark by stalling on developing the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard President [[Larry Summers]], who is dismissive and sees no value in either disciplinary action or ''Thefacebook'' website itself.

Saverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to "Facebook me", a phrase which impresses both of them. As ''Thefacebook'' grows in popularity, Zuckerberg extends the network to [[Yale University]], [[Columbia University]] and [[Stanford University]]. Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet [[Napster]] co-founder [[Sean Parker]], who presents a "billion-dollar" vision for the company that impresses Zuckerberg. He also suggests dropping "The" from ''Thefacebook'', just calling it ''Facebook''. At Parker's suggestion, the company moves to [[Palo Alto]], with Saverin remaining in New York to work on business development. After Parker promises to expand Facebook to two continents, Zuckerberg invites him to live at the house he is using as company headquarters.

While competing in the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] for Harvard against the [[Hollandia Roeiclub]], the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[London School of Economics|LSE]], and decide to sue the company for theft of [[Intellectual property rights|intellectual property]]. Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company's bank account in the resulting dispute. He later relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $500,000 from [[angel investor]] [[Peter Thiel]]. However, Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook to be [[Stock dilution|diluted]] from 34% to 0.03%, while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, and Saverin vows to sue Zuckerberg for all the company's shares before being ejected from the building. Subsequently, Saverin's name is removed from the masthead as co-founder. Later, a cocaine possession incident involving Parker and his attempt to place the blame on Saverin finally convinces Zuckerberg to cut ties with him.

Throughout the film, the narrative is intercut with scenes from [[Deposition (law)|depositions]] taken in the Winklevoss twins' and Saverin's respective lawsuits against Zuckerberg and Facebook. The Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. At the end, Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin, since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's own callous attitude will make him highly unsympathetic to a jury. After everyone leaves, Zuckerberg is shown sending a friend request to Albright on Facebook and then refreshing the webpage every few seconds as he waits for her response.

The epilogue states that Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss received a [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] of $65&amp;nbsp;million, signed a [[non-disclosure agreement]], and rowed in the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]], placing sixth; Eduardo Saverin received a settlement of an unknown amount and his name was restored to the Facebook masthead as a co-founder; the website has over 500&amp;nbsp;million members in 207 countries and is valued at $25&amp;nbsp;billion; and Mark Zuckerberg is the world's youngest self-made billionaire.

==Production==

===Screenplay===
Screenwriter [[Aaron Sorkin]] said, "What attracted me to [the film project] had nothing to do with Facebook. The invention itself is as modern as it gets, but the story is as old as storytelling; the themes of friendship, loyalty, jealousy, class and power. [...] I got a 14-page book proposal that [[Ben Mezrich]] had written for his publisher for a book he was going to call ''[[The Accidental Billionaires]]''. The publisher was simultaneously shopping it around for a film sale. That's how it wound up in my hands. I was reading it and somewhere on page three I said yes. It was the fastest I said yes to anything. But Ben hadn't written the book yet, and I assumed that Sony was going to want me to wait for Ben to write the book, and I would start a year from now. They wanted me to start right away. Ben and I were kind of doing our research at the same time, sort of along parallel lines."&lt;ref name="FaceValue"&gt;{{cite web|last=Callaghan|first=Dylan|title=Face Value|url=http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=4348|work=The Craft|publisher=Writer's Guild of America, West|accessdate=August 14, 2012|date=October 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Sorkin, Mezrich did not send him material from his book as he wrote it: "Two or three times we'd get together. I'd go to Boston, or we'd meet in New York and kind of compare notes and share information, but I didn't see the book until he was done with it. By the time I saw the book, I was probably 80 percent done with the screenplay."&lt;ref name="FaceValue"/&gt; Sorkin elaborated:
{{Cquote|There's a lot of available research, and I also did a lot of first person research with a number of the people that were involved in the story. I can't go too deeply into that because most of the people did it on the condition of anonymity, but what I found was that two lawsuits were brought against Facebook at roughly the same time, that the defendant, plaintiffs, witnesses all came into a deposition room and swore under oath, and three different versions of the story were told. Instead of choosing one and deciding that's the truest one or choosing one and deciding that's the juiciest one, I decided to dramatize the idea that there were three different versions of the story being told. That's how I came up with the structure of the deposition room.&lt;ref name="FaceValue"/&gt; }}

[[Joe Morgenstern]] in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' praised the film as exhilarating but noted: "The biographical part takes liberties with its subject. Aaron Sorkin based his screenplay on a contentious book, Ben Mezrich's ''[[The Accidental Billionaires]]'', so everything that's seen isn't necessarily to be believed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704483004575523822326312414?mod=WSJ_LifeStyle_Lifestyle_6 |title=Social Network: Password Is Perfection |work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |first=Joe |last=Morgenstern |date=October 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Clark of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that "there's something insidious about this genre of [docudrama] scriptwriting," wondering if "a 26-year-old businessman really deserves to have his name dragged through the mud in a murky mixture of fact and imagination for the general entertainment of the movie-viewing public?"

Several noteworthy tech journalists and bloggers voiced their opinions of how the film portrays its real-life characters.

{{cquote|The real-life Zuckerberg was maniacally focused on building a web site that could potentially connect everyone on the planet...By contrast, in the film he seems more obsessed with achieving the largesse that bad boy [[Sean Parker]], an original [[Napster]] founder, portrays when he arrives to meet Zuckerberg at a New York restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessi |last=Hempel |title=The incredibly untrue adventures of Mark Zuckerberg |date=September 24, 2010 |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/09/24/the-incredibly-untrue-adventures-of-mark-zuckerberg |work=Fortune.CNN.com |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Harvard Law School]] professor [[Lawrence Lessig]] wrote in ''[[The New Republic]]'' that Sorkin's screenplay does not acknowledge the "real villain" of the story:
{{cquote|The total and absolute absurdity of the world where the engines of a federal lawsuit get cranked up to adjudicate the hurt feelings (because "our idea was stolen!") of entitled Harvard undergraduates is completely missed by Sorkin. We can't know enough from the film to know whether there was actually any substantial legal claim here. Sorkin has been upfront about the fact that there are fabrications aplenty lacing the story. But from the story as told, we certainly know enough to know that any legal system that would allow these kids to extort $65 million from the most successful business this century should be ashamed of itself. Did Zuckerberg breach his contract? Maybe, for which the damages are more like $650, not $65 million. Did he steal a trade secret? Absolutely not. Did he steal any other "property"? Absolutely not—the code for Facebook was his, and the "idea" of a social network is not a patent. It wasn't justice that gave the twins $65 million; it was the fear of a random and inefficient system of law. That system is a tax on innovation and creativity. That tax is the real villain here, not the innovator it burdened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lawrence |last=Lessig |title=Sorkin vs. Zuckerberg |date=October 1, 2010 |url=http://www.tnr.com/print/article/books-and-arts/78081/sorkin-zuckerberg-the-social-network |work=The New Republic |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
