The '''A256''' is a key [[road]] running north-south through [[East Kent]] which connects the [[Thanet District|Thanet]] towns to [[Dover]]. It is operated by [[Kent County Council]] as a primary route, and has seen investment in the past to connect traffic to the [[Port of Ramsgate]], and to the [[Pfizer]] research centre in [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1997/jul/17/thanet-regeneration|title=Thanet Regeneration|date=17 July 1997|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thanet ==
The road begins in the outskirts of the [[Thanet District|Thanet]] town of [[Broadstairs]], at a roundabout with the [[A255 road|A255]] where it heads westwards through the [[Westwood, Kent|Westwood]] Retail Parks via "Westwood Road".

The A256 then passes 2 roundabouts with residential estates on the left before arriving at a couple of smaller roundabouts with exits to the left and right into the various retail parks. Most of these parks were built during the early 2000s.
Also in [[Westwood, Kent|Westwood]], the A256 meets a large roundabout with the [[A254 road|A254]]  Margate Road. Here the A256 heads south-westwards, called 'Haine Road', passing [[Westwood Cross]] shopping centre on the left (built on the former Haine Hospital site) at a roundabout with Manston Court Road (on the right). The A256 then briefly bypasses the village of Haine, along New Haine Road, constructed in early 2009, which heads southeastwards alongside Westwood Cross shopping centre, before heading southwestwards after another roundabout, and passing The Marlowe Academy. At the next roundabout, with the Euro Kent Business Park situated on the left, the A256 then rejoins its original route along Haine Road.

Here, the route of the A256 takes a more southerly direction, travelling in the direction of [[sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]]. The three cooling towers of [[Richborough Power Station]] could once be seen in the distance, before they were demolished in March 2012.
Further along Haine Road the A256 becomes dual carriageway for about 300 metres (0.2 miles) with its junction with the [[B2050 road|B2050]] Manston Road.
[[File:Hugin Viking Ship2.JPG|thumb|The Viking Ship "Hugin" at [[Cliffsend]]]]
Approximately 600 metres (0.4 miles) after this junction, the A256 encounters a double roundabout junction, known as the "Lord of the Manor" roundabout, named after the pub on the junction. At the first junction there are exits for the [[A299 road|A299]] (formerly [[A253 road|A253]]) towards [[London]] and [[Canterbury]], and for the (joint) A256/[[A299 road|A299]]  towards [[Ramsgate]] and [[Dover]]. A railway line separates the two roundabouts and passes underneath the main dual road A256/[[A299 road|A299]], with high white concrete walls on both sides of the road. At the second roundabout there are exits for the [[A299 road|A299]] travelling towards [[Ramsgate]] and the A256, travelling southwards, towards Sandwich. It is here where the A256 becomes a [[primary route]].

Shortly after the [[Lord of the Manor]] roundabout, the A256 Sandwich Road bends to the right, now facing a more south-westerly direction as it enters the village of [[Cliffsend]]. The majority of the built-up area of [[Cliffsend]] is on the western side of the road. The land to the south of the village is relatively flat and low-lying (just 3 metres above sea level). It previously formed the [[Wantsum Channel]] which used to separate the [[Isle of Thanet]] from mainland Kent. The famous [[Viking Ship 'Hugin']] sits on the east side of the A256, separating the road from the sea. [[St Augustines Golf Club]] is situated next to the A256 south-west of [[Cliffsend]]. [[Cliffsend]] also forms the boundary on the A256 between [[Thanet District Council]] and [[Dover District Council]].

== Sandwich ==
[[File:Richborough Chimneys.JPG|thumb|The Cooling towers at the disused Richborough Power Station]]
The single road then travels through low and flat land, passing Richborough Port, Castle, and disused Power Station. A Subway and petrol stations are also situated on the left-hand and right hand sides of the road, in between the road and Sandwich Bay.
The [[River Stour, Kent|River Stour]], which previously formed part of the [[Wantsum Channel]], runs parallel on both sides of Ramsgate Road. At the next roundabout, the original A256 Ramsgate Road leaves the new bypass, and heads towards [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]] town centre. The bypass itself continues the route of the A256 in a slow semicircle to the west of the town of Sandwich. The bypass is composed of four roundabouts; the second roundabout has three more exits – the [[A257 road|A257]] Canterbury Road heading towards [[Canterbury]], a minor road travelling towards Sandwich town centre (previously the [[A257 road|A257]] before the bypass was built) and the A256 bypass travelling southwards towards [[Dover]]. At the third roundabout of the Sandwich bypass, there are three more exits – the former A256 towards Sandwich, the [[A258 road|A258]] (which actually continues the Sandwich bypass for a further 0.3 miles) towards [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], and the A256 Sandwich Road towards Dover. Here the A256 changes to a south-westerly direction, briefly bypassing the village of [[Eastry]] for approximately {{convert|1.4|mi|km}}. Note there are two filling stations (Total &amp; Texaco). There is another petrol station which is Jet nearby. All of them had car washes.

== Dover ==
The Eastry bypass ends with a roundabout where the former A256 rejoins the current route known as "Dover Road" onto a dual carriageway. However, as the A256 continues to travel southwards, about a mile further south the old A256 Dover Road leaves the new bypass and passes through the village of [[Tilmanstone]], whilst the current A256 dual carriageway diverts on a more easterly journey. Approximately {{convert|1.8|mi|km}} further south from this junction is a roundabout where the old A256 once again rejoins the dual carriageway – there is also a minor road on the left heading towards [[East Studdal]].

Shortly after this roundabout, the A256 splits once again and continues on a dual carriageway bypass whilst the former A256 Sandwich Road travels through the village of [[Whitfield, Kent|Whitfield]] before arriving at a large roundabout south of [[Whitfield, Kent|Whitfield]], with the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]]. 
The current A256 dual carriageway actually arrives at a junction with the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] dual carriageway a further {{convert|0.4|mi|km}} to the east, where the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] and A256 merge and travel westwards for 700 metres until the roundabout at Whitfield. 

This is where the A256 loses its [[primary route]] status and also becomes a single road, travelling south westwards briefly for (approximately) 0.6 miles, before turning left onto London Road, heading towards [[Dover]] town centre in a south-easterly direction. Roughly {{convert|0.6|mi|km}} along London Road and the A256 enters the built up area of [[Buckland, Kent|Buckland]] and travels downhill towards [[Dover]]. 

Soon after passing underneath a railway bridge, a one-way system is encountered where the road number A256 is given to both Buckland Avenue and London Road which form part of the one-way system.
Eventually, after meeting the [[A258 road|A258]] once again on the downhill part of the one-way system, the A256 terminates on the [[A20 road (England)|A20]] Townwall Street, which runs parallel to the coastline, north-eastwards towards the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] Jubilee Way and south-westwards towards Folkestone and the [[M20 motorway]].

The '''A5127''' is a major [[road]] in [[England]] which runs between [[Birmingham]] and [[Lichfield]], [[Staffordshire]]. For much of the route the road follows the old route of the [[A38 road|A38]] which has since been moved in order to by-pass places such as [[Erdington]] and [[Sutton Coldfield]] and form a [[relief road]] from Birmingham city centre to [[Gravelly Hill Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]].

The part from the county boundary, through [[Shenstone, Staffordshire|Shenstone]] to Lichfield was one of the roads of the [[Lichfield Turnpike Trust]], established in 1729.&lt;ref name= "LichAct"&gt;Local Act, 2 Geo. II, c.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond Lichfield, it joins the Roman [[Ryknild Street]] at [[Streethay]]&lt;ref name= "Margary305"&gt;Margary, Ivan (1967). Roman Roads in Britain. John Baker Publishers., pp. 305-6.&lt;/ref&gt; and immediately after that joins the present A38.

The '''administrative divisions of [[Chad]]''' have often changed since 1900, when the territory was first created by [[France]] as part of its [[French colonial empires|colonial empire]], with the name ''Territoire Militaire des pays et protectorats du Tchad''.&lt;ref&gt;S. Decalo (1987); ''Historical Dictionary of Chad'', 2 ed. Metuchen: The Scarecrow Press. {{ISBN|0-8108-1937-6}}, pp. 8, 309.&lt;/ref&gt; The first subdivision took place in 1910, when 9 circonscriptions were made, named ''départements'' (departments) in 1935 and ''régions'' (regions) in 1947. As for the regions, they were further divided in districts.&lt;ref name="Lanne11"&gt;B. Lanne (1998); ''Histoire politique du Tchad de 1945 à 1958'', Karthala. {{ISBN|2-86537-883-7}}{{fr icon}}, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, immediately before independence, the ''régions'' became ''[[prefectures of Chad|préfectures]]'' (prefectures), and the districts instead ''sous-prefectures'' (sub-prefectures). The prefectures were in origin 11, later on raising to 14.&lt;ref&gt;S. Decalo, pp. 30-32&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 they were modified in 28 departments; this was ultimately changed in 2002, when 18 regions replaced them.&lt;ref name="statoids" /&gt; As for the regions, they are divided in [[departments of Chad|departments]], while the latter are divided in [[Sub-prefectures of Chad|sub-prefectures]].&lt;ref name=statoids/&gt; After a series of splits in 2008 the number of regions increased to 22.&lt;ref&gt;Ordonnance n° 002/PR/08 portant restructuration de certaines collectivités territoriales décentralisées&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Ennedi Region was split into Ennedi-Est and Ennedi-Ouest, producing the current 23 regions.&lt;ref name=ordonnance&gt;{{cite web |last=Déby |first=Idriss |author-link=Idriss Déby |url=http://sgg-tchad.org/ordonnances/ORD_70001.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403231328/http://sgg-tchad.org/ordonnances/ORD_70001.pdf |archive-date=3 April 2015 |title=Ordonnance No. 27/PR/2012 |publisher=Republic of Chad |date=4 September 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=statoids&gt;{{cite web |last=Law |first=Gwillim |url=http://www.statoids.com/utd.html |title=Regions of Chad |website=Statoids |accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On September 5, 1900, a decree signed by the [[President of France|French President]] [[Émile Loubet]] officially created the ''[[Colonial Chad|Territoire militaire des pays et protectorats du Tchad]]'' as part of the growing [[French colonial empires|French colonial empire]]. The new territory was placed under the command of a Commissioner who answered to the High Commissioner of the [[French Congo]] (called [[French Equatorial Africa]] (AEF) after 1910), of which Chad was a circuscription.&lt;ref name="Lanne9"&gt;B. Lanne, pp. 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 Chad was merged with the [[Oubangui-Chari]], becoming an autonomous territory within the ''Oubangui-Chari-Tchad'' colony, suppressed in 1916. In 1920 Chad was placed on an equal standing with the other AEF colonies (i. e. [[Gabon]], Oubangui-Chari and [[Middle Congo]]).&lt;ref name="Lanne9"/&gt;

It was only in 1958, when Chad was granted [[territorial autonomy]], that the country was separated from the AEF.&lt;ref&gt;B. Lanne, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later Chad was to come full independence under the government of [[François Tombalbaye]] and of the [[Chadian Progressive Party]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Decalo, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1910–19 circumscriptions ==
The first Governor-General of French Equatorial Africa, [[Martial Merlin]], built in 1910 for all the colonies he administered a two levels structure. Chad was divided in 9 ''circonscriptions'' (circumscriptions), with [[Fort-Lamy]] (today N'Djamena) as capital; two years later, as an underdivision of the regions, the ''subdivisions'' were introduced.&lt;ref name="Lanne11"/&gt; The Mayo-Kebbi circumscription disappeared in 1911 when the left bank of the [[Logone River]] was ceded to the [[German colonial empire|German colony]] of [[Kamerun]] as part of the exchange for the [[French Morocco|French protectorate]] over [[Morocco]]. the area was retaken by [[France]] in [[World War I]], and some years later, in 1922, the circumscription was restored and given back to Chad. On the other side Moyen-Chari was part of Oubangui-Chari from 1925 to 1933.&lt;ref&gt;S. Decalo, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Le Cornec (1963); ''Histoire politique du Tchad de 1960 à 1962'', Librairie générale de droit et jurisprudencie.{{fr icon}}, pp. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 a new circumscription was added with Borkou-Ennedi, renamed Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti in 1930 when the [[Tibesti]] was passed from [[Niger]] to Chad.&lt;ref name="Lanne11"/&gt;

== 1934 departments ==

===Centralization===
In 1934 all the AEF was the object of a major administrative reorganization, known as Renard reform after the Governor-General [[Edouard Renard]]. Meant to cut down the maintainment costs and transform the AEF in an unitary colony divided in 4 regions. Chad was placed under a ''commandant de région'' who awnsered to the Governor-Delegate in [[Bangui]], who instead was under the Governor-General in [[Brazzaville]].&lt;ref name="Cornec35"&gt;J. Le Cornec, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lanne10"&gt;B. Lanne, pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumscriptions of Chad took the name of departments and many of them were merged, while two departments, Logone (united with the Mayo-Kebbi) and Chari-Bangoran (Moyen-Chari and [[N'Délé]]) were separated from Chad and placed directly under Bangui's administration.&lt;ref name="Cornec35"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lanne10"/&gt;

{| border=1 cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"

|-
|1||Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti
|-
|2||Chari-Baguirmi
|-
|3||Kanem-Batha
|-
|4||Ouaddaï-Salamat
|}

===Decentralization===
The radicality of these centralization measures proved themselves unsustainable, causing their reversion on the return to the previous structure of the AEF in 1936. In that year Logone and Moyen-Chari were returned to Chad while both Kanem-Batha and Chari-Baguirmi were split restoring the original 10 subdivisions. In 1944 the departments were brought to 9, when Bas-Chari and Baguirmi were merged back to recreate Chari-Baguirmi.&lt;ref name="Lanne11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornec35"/&gt;

In 1937 Chad was made fully independent from Bangui but the administrator was given the lesser rank of ''commandant''. The following year his rank was increased to ''governeur'' (governor), reestablishing a full parity among the AEF colonies.&lt;ref name="Lanne11"/&gt;

This is the situation of Chad on December 31, 1945, concerning departments and subdivisions:&lt;ref&gt;B. Lanne, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

ARCHER is a daytime non-invasive technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings.&lt;ref name=Alexa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atg.cap.gov/downloads/FINAL%20VERSION%20ARCHER%20general%20fact%20sheet.pdf |title=Fact Sheet: Civil Air Patrol ARCHER System |accessdate=2007-09-08 |author=Alexa, Colonel Drew |date=August 2005 |publisher=[[Civil Air Patrol]] |quote=HSI is a daytime non-invasive technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708212211/http://atg.cap.gov/downloads/FINAL%20VERSION%20ARCHER%20general%20fact%20sheet.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses a special camera facing down through a [[quartz glass]] portal in the belly of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500&amp;nbsp;feet (800&amp;nbsp;meters) and 100 [[knot (unit)|knots]] (50&amp;nbsp;meters/second) ground speed.&lt;ref name= Alexa2 /&gt;

Col. Alexa described the system to the press in 2007: "The human eye sees basically three bands of light. The ARCHER sensor sees 50. It can see things that are anomalous in the vegetation such as metal or something from an airplane wreckage."&lt;ref name=Friess /&gt; Major Cynthia Ryan of the [[Nevada]] Civil Air Patrol, while also describing the system to the press in 2007, stated, "ARCHER is essentially something used by the geosciences. It's pretty sophisticated stuff … beyond what the human eye can generally see,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hu5Ip6-JjXMirJLN9fHn6oVQkv9A |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5RjISKtdI?url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hu5Ip6-JjXMirJLN9fHn6oVQkv9A |title=High-tech plane used in hunt for adventurer Fossett |archivedate=2007-09-09 |author=Woollard, Rob |date=2007-09-05 |work=[[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP) |publisher=[[Yahoo!

In addition to the primary search and rescue mission, CAP has tested additional uses for ARCHER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacecomputer.com/systems/archer.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5RjISKtcz?url=http://www.spacecomputer.com/systems/archer.html |title=ARCHER HSI System |archivedate=2007-09-09 |publisher=Space Computer Corporation |quote=CAP has found many additional uses for ARCHER, including missions for homeland security, disaster assessment, and drug interdiction. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an ARCHER equipped CAP GA8 was used in a pilot project in Missouri in August 2005 to assess the suitability of the system for tracking [[hazardous material]] releases into the environment,&lt;ref name=MoDNR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.mo.gov/env/hwp/hsi/hsi-project.htm |title=EPA/MoDNR Pilot Project—Characterizing Environmental Contamination Through Airborne Hyperspectral Imaging |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5RjISKtd8?url=http://www.dnr.mo.gov/env/hwp/hsi/hsi-project.htm |archivedate=2007-09-09 |publisher=Missouri Department of Natural Resources |quote=Missouri Department of Natural Resources ... is pursuing a Pilot Project to evaluate environmental applications of ARCHER ... |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one was deployed to track [[oil spill]]s in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Rita]] in Texas during September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/News/Photos.aspx?igphoto=2000578631 |title=Civil Air Patrol responds |date=2005-09-26 |accessdate=2014-06-20 |publisher=[[United States Air Force]] |quote=A Gippsland Aeronautics GA-8 'Airvan' … came to West Houston Airport to support the assessment of Hurricane Rita.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, in the case of a flight originating in Missouri, the ARCHER system proved its usefulness in October 2006, when it found the wreckage in Antlers, Okla.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,221505,00.html 3 Bodies Found After Oklahoma Plane Crash; Fourth Victim Still Missing (FOX News)]&lt;/ref&gt; The National Transportation and Safety Board was extremely pleased with the data ARCHER provided, which was later used to locate aircraft debris spread over miles of rough, wooded terrain. In July 2007, the ARCHER system identified a flood-borne oil spill originating in a Kansas oil refinery, that extended downstream and had invaded previously unsuspected reservoir areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capmembers.com/media/cms/Download_2007_ARC_8ED5CA68CC66A.pdf 2007 Civil Air Patrol Annual Report to Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; The client agencies (EPA, Coast Guard, and other federal and state agencies) found the data essential to quick remediation. In September 2008, a Civil Air Patrol GA-8 from Texas Wing searched for a missing aircraft from Arkansas. It was found in Oklahoma, identified simultaneously by ground searchers and the overflying ARCHER system. Rather than a direct find, this was a validation of the system's accuracy and efficacy. In the subsequent recovery, it was found that the ARCHER plotted the debris area with great accuracy.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

=== Hyperspectral imager ===
The passive [[hyperspectral]] [[imaging spectroscopy]] [[remote sensor]] observes a target in multi-[[Spectrum|spectral]] bands. The HSI camera separates the image [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] into 52 "bins" from 500 [[Nanometre|nanometers]]&amp;nbsp;(nm) [[wavelength]] at the blue end of the [[visible spectrum]] to 1100&amp;nbsp;nm in the [[infrared]], giving the camera a [[spectral resolution]] of 11.5&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tests.cap.af.mil/ops/archer_training/archer_hsi_tech/glossary.cfm |title=HSI Technology&amp;nbsp;— Glossary |accessdate=2007-10-29 |work=Hyperspectral Imaging Technology for the Non-Scientist |publisher=[[Civil Air Patrol]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722070800/https://tests.cap.af.mil/ops/archer_training/archer_hsi_tech/glossary.cfm |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ARCHER records data in all 52 bands, the computational algorithms only use the first 40 bands, from 500&amp;nbsp;nm to 960&amp;nbsp;nm because the bands above 960&amp;nbsp;nm are too [[Signal-to-noise ratio|noisy]] to be useful.&lt;ref name=test&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tests.cap.af.mil/ops/archer_training/archer_hsi_tech/Hyperspectral%20&amp;%20High%20Resolution%20Imagery.cfm |title=HSI Technology&amp;nbsp;— HSI and HRI Imagery |accessdate=2007-10-31 |publisher=[[Civil Air Patrol]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722070813/https://tests.cap.af.mil/ops/archer_training/archer_hsi_tech/Hyperspectral%20%26%20High%20Resolution%20Imagery.cfm |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the normal human eye will respond to wavelengths from approximately [[1 E-7 m|400 to 700&amp;nbsp;nm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.howstuffworks.com/light2.htm | title = How Light Works | accessdate = 2007-10-29 | author = Freudenrich, Craig | work =  How Stuff Works| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071027145047/http://www.howstuffworks.com/light2.htm| archivedate= 27 October 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is [[trichromatic]], meaning the eye's [[cone cells]] only sense light in three spectral bands.

As the ARCHER aircraft flies over a search area, reflected sunlight is collected by the HSI camera lens. The collected light passes through a set of lenses that focus the light to form an image of the ground. The imaging system uses a pushbroom approach to image acquisition. With the pushbroom approach, the focusing slit reduces the image height to the equivalent of one vertical pixel, creating a horizontal line image.

The horizontal line image is then projected onto a diffraction grating, which is a very finely etched reflecting surface that disperses light into its spectra.  The diffraction grating is specially constructed and positioned to create a two-dimensional (2D) spectrum image from the horizontal line image.  The spectra are projected vertically, i.e., perpendicular to the line image, by the design and arrangement of the diffraction grating.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The 2D spectrum image projects onto a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) two-dimensional image sensor, which is aligned so that the horizontal pixels are parallel to the image's horizontal.  As a result, the vertical pixels are coincident to the spectra produced from the diffraction grating.  Each column of pixels receives the spectrum of one horizontal pixel from the original image.  The arrangement of vertical pixel sensors in the CCD divides the spectrum into distinct and non-overlapping intervals.  The CCD output consists of electrical signals for 52 spectral bands for each of 504 horizontal image pixels.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The on-board computer records the CCD output signal at a frame rate of sixty times each second. At an aircraft altitude of 2,500&amp;nbsp;ft AGL and a speed of 100&amp;nbsp;knots, a 60&amp;nbsp;Hz frame rate equates to a ground image resolution of approximately one square meter per pixel. Thus, every frame captured from the CCD contains the spectral data for a ground swath that is approximately one meter long and 500&amp;nbsp;meters wide.&lt;ref name=test /&gt;

=== High-resolution imager ===

A high-resolution imaging (HRI) black-and-white, or panchromatic, camera is mounted adjacent to the HSI camera to enable both cameras to capture the same reflected light. The HRI camera uses a pushbroom approach just like the HSI camera with a similar lens and slit arrangement to limit the incoming light to a thin, wide beam. However, the HRI camera does not have a diffraction grating to disperse the incoming reflected light. Instead, the light is directed to a wider CCD to capture more image data. Because it captures a single line of the ground image per frame, it is called a line scan camera. The HRI CCD is 6,144&amp;nbsp;pixels wide and one pixel high. It operates at a frame rate of 720&amp;nbsp;Hz. At ARCHER search speed and altitude (100&amp;nbsp;knots over the ground at 2,500&amp;nbsp;ft AGL) each pixel in the black-and-white image represents a 3&amp;nbsp;inch by 3&amp;nbsp;inch area of the ground. This high resolution adds the capability to identify some objects.&lt;ref name=test /&gt;

=== Processing ===
A monitor in the cockpit displays detailed images in real time, and the system also logs the image and [[Global Positioning System]] data at a rate of 30 [[gigabyte]]s (GB) per hour for later analysis.&lt;ref name=Friess /&gt; The on-board data processing system performs numerous real-time processing functions including [[data acquisition]] and recording, raw data correction, target detection, cueing and chipping, precision image [[Georeference|geo-registration]], and display and dissemination of image products and target cue information.&lt;ref name=Stevenson2005_2&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARCHER has three methods for locating targets:
* ''signature matching'' where reflected light is matched to spectral signatures
* ''anomaly detection'' using a statistical model of the [[pixel]]s in the image to determine the probability that a pixel does not match the profile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://level2.cap.gov/index.cfm?nodeID=5175 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5RjISKtdb?url=http://level2.cap.gov/index.cfm?nodeID=5175 |title=CAP's Advanced Technologies Group: Hyperspectral Imaging |archivedate=2007-09-09 |publisher=Civil Air Patrol, National Headquarters |quote=…signature matching (matching reflected light to spectral signatures), anomaly detection (calculates a statistical model of all the pixels in the image to see if there is a probability that a pixel does not fit). |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* ''change detection'' which executes a pixel-by-pixel comparison of the current image against ground conditions that were obtained in a previous mission over the same area.

In change detection, scene changes are identified, and new, moved or departed targets are highlighted for evaluation.&lt;ref name=AFNORTH /&gt; In spectral signature matching, the system can be programmed with the parameters of a missing aircraft, such as paint colors, to alert the operators of possible wreckage.&lt;ref name=Fiorino /&gt; It can also be used to look for specific materials, such as petroleum products or other chemicals released into the environment,&lt;ref name=MoDNR /&gt; or even ordinary items like commonly available blue [[polyethylene]] [[tarpaulin]]s.

The '''Arabah''' ({{lang-ar|وادي عربة}}, ''Wādī ʻAraba''), or '''Arava'''/ '''Aravah''' ({{lang-he-n|הָעֲרָבָה}}, ''HaAravah'', lit. "desolate and dry area"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |editor= |encyclopedia=אנציקלופדיה מפה |title=עֲרָבָה |trans-title=Arava|language=Hebrew |edition= |date= |year=2000 |publisher=[[Mapa]] |volume=6 |location=[[Tel Aviv]] |isbn= |pages=107–110 |quote=השם קדום (דברים א 1 ועוד) ומשמעו אזור שומם ויבש }}&lt;/ref&gt;), as it is known by its respective [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]] names, is a geographic area south of the [[Dead Sea]] basin, which forms part of the border between [[Israel]] to the west and [[Jordan]] to the east.

The old meaning, which was in use up to the early 20th century, covered almost the entire length of what today is called the [[Jordan Rift Valley]], running in a north-south orientation between the southern end of the [[Sea of Galilee]] and the northern tip of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] at [[Aqaba]]/ [[Eilat]]. This included the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan River Valley]] between the [[Sea of Galilee]] and the Dead Sea, the Dead Sea itself, and what today is commonly called the  Arava Valley. The contemporary use of the term is restricted to this southern section alone.

==Geography==
[[Image:PikiWiki_Israel_37729_Barak_stream.JPG|thumb|[[Nahal Barak]] in Israel's [[Southern_District_(Israel)|Southern District]] is part of a system of streams draining the Arava desert.]] 

The Arabah is {{convert|166|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length, from the Gulf of Aqaba to the southern shore of the Dead Sea.

Topographically, the region is divided into three sections. From the Gulf of Aqaba northward, the land gradually rises over a distance of {{convert|77|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and reaches a height of {{convert|230|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, which represents the [[water divide|watershed divide]] between the Dead Sea and the [[Red Sea]]. From this crest, the land slopes gently northward over the next {{convert|74|km|mi|abbr=on}} to a point {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Dead Sea. In the last section, the Arabah drops steeply to the Dead Sea, which is {{convert|417|m|ft|abbr=on}} below sea level.

The Arabah is scenic with colorful cliffs and sharp-topped mountains. The southern Arabah is hot and dry and virtually without rain.

==Flora and fauna==
There are numerous species of flora and fauna in the Aravah Valley.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Chichester Hart]]. 1891, ''Some account of the fauna and flora of Sinai, Petra, and Wâdy Arabah, 255 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Notably the [[caracal]] (''Caracal caracal'') is found on the valley's [[savanna]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=35844 ''Caracal: Caracal caracal'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Wadi Aravah Sunset Israel Jordan.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Wadi Arabah. Sunset.]]
In Biblical times, the Arava was a center of copper production; [[King Solomon]] is believed to have had mines here based on copper mines dating to his reign. The Arabah, especially its eastern part, was part of the realm of the [[Edom]]ites (called "Idumeans" during the Roman times). Later the eastern Arabah became the domain of the [[Nabatea]]ns, the builders of the city of [[Petra]].

[[File:Arabah.jpg|thumb|Nahal Hayoun running into the Arabah. Photograph from Palmach archives. 1948.]]

The [[Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace|Israel–Jordan Peace Treaty]] was signed in the Arava on October 26, 1994. The governments of Jordan and Israel are promoting development of the region. There is a plan to bring sea water from the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Dead Sea]] through a canal ([[Two Seas Canal|Red–Dead Seas Canal]]), which  follows along the Arabah. This (long envisioned) project was once an issue of dispute between Jordan and Israel, but it was recently agreed that the project shall be constructed on and by the Jordanian side.

==Demography==
In 2004, the Jordanian administrative district of Wadi Araba had a population of 6,775.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan Department of Statistics. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Five major tribes comprise eight settlements on the Jordanian side: Al-S'eediyeen ({{lang|ar|السعيديين}}), Al-Ihewat ({{lang|ar|الإحيوات}}), Al-Ammareen ({{lang|ar|العمارين}}), Al-Rashaideh ({{lang|ar|الرشايدة}}), and Al-Azazmeh ({{lang|ar|العزازمة}}), as well as smaller tribes of the Al-Oseifat ({{lang|ar|العصيفات}}), Al-Rawajfeh ({{lang|ar|الرواجفة}}), Al-Manaja'h ({{lang|ar|المناجعة}}), and Al-Marzaqa ({{lang|ar|المرزقة}}), among others. The main economic activities for these Arabah residents revolve around herding sheep, agriculture, handicrafts, and the Jordanian Army.

==Landmarks==

[[Timna Valley Park]] is notable for its prehistoric rock carvings, some of the oldest copper mines in the world, and a convoluted cliff called King Solomon's pillars. On the Jordanian side is the famous [[Wadi Rum]], which is famous among rock climbers, hikers, campers, and lovers of the outdoors. Also in Jordan is the copper mining area of [[Wadi Feynan]], including the site of [[Khirbat en-Nahas]], corresponding to the one from Timna Valley in the west.

Feynan Ecolodge was opened in [[Wadi Feynan]] by the [[Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature]] in 2005.

==Geography==
[[File:Sunset at Çeşme overlooking Chios.jpg|thumb|right|Sunset over the mountains of Chios as viewed from Çeşme]]
The Chios Strait is approximately 3 nautical miles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sailingissues.com/greekislands/chios.html |title=Chios island - Chios maps for sailing holidays and yacht charters}}&lt;/ref&gt; in width, and it is the body of water that separates Chios from the [[isthmus]]es along the western extremity of the [[Karaburun Peninsula, Turkey|Karaburun Peninsula]] in Turkey. The peninsula hosts many major districts and cities in [[İzmir Province]], including the municipality of [[Çeşme]], the westernmost city along the peninsula and, therefore, the closest to Chios. Çeşme is one of the northern cities of the [[Turkish Riviera]], and almost its entire coastline is situated along the waters of the strait. In many situations, such as in the photograph to the right, the mountains of Chios and the Chios Strait can easily be viewed from Turkey, and vice versa along the east coast of Chios from settlements such as [[Karfas]]. The hospitable water conditions of the Chios Strait make it a very common tourism and boating destination on both the Greek and Turkish coasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chios.com/en/about-chios |title=About Chios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clouds-1099739_1280.jpg|thumb|Climatology is the scientific study of the climate.]]

'''Climatology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κλίμα}}, ''klima'', "place, zone"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') or '''climate science''' is the scientific study of [[climate]], scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Climate Prediction Center. [http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/outreach/glossary.shtml#C Climate Glossary.]  Retrieved on November 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This modern field of study is regarded as a branch of the [[atmospheric sciences]] and a subfield of [[physical geography]], which is one of the [[Earth science]]s. Climatology now includes aspects of [[oceanography]] and [[biogeochemistry]].  Basic knowledge of climate can be used within shorter term [[weather forecasting]] using analog techniques such as the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO), the [[Madden–Julian oscillation]] (MJO), the [[North Atlantic oscillation]] (NAO), the [[Northern Annular Mode]] (NAM) which is also known as the [[Arctic oscillation]] (AO), the Northern Pacific (NP) Index, the [[Pacific decadal oscillation]] (PDO), and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO).  Climate models are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system to projections of future climate. Weather is known as the condition of the atmosphere over a period of time, while climate has to do with the atmospheric condition over an extended to indefinite period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drought.unl.edu/DroughtBasics/WhatisClimatology.aspx|title=What is Climatology?|website=drought.unl.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{main|History of climate change science}}
Chinese scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) inferred that climates naturally shifted over an enormous span of time, after observing [[petrified]] [[bamboo]]s found underground near Yanzhou (modern day [[Yan'an]], [[Shaanxi]] province), a dry-climate area unsuitable for the growth of bamboo.&lt;ref name="BowdenBurek2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A. J. Bowden|author2=Cynthia V. Burek|author3=C. V. Burek|author4=Richard Wilding|title=History of palaeobotany: selected essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttMUHDRgr6MC&amp;pg=PA293|accessdate=3 April 2013|year=2005 |publisher=[[Geological Society]] |isbn=978-1-86239-174-1|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early climate researchers include [[Edmund Halley]], who published a map of the trade winds in 1686 after a voyage to the southern hemisphere.  [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–1790) first mapped the course of the [[Gulf Stream]] for use in sending mail from the [[United States]] to [[Europe]].  [[Francis Galton]] (1822–1911) invented the term ''[[anticyclone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Life Stories. [http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/S/science/life/biog_galton.html Francis Galton.] Retrieved on April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Helmut Landsberg]] (1906–1985) fostered the use of [[statistical analysis]] in climatology, which led to its evolution into a physical science.

The Greeks began the formal study of climate; in fact the word climate is derived from the Greek word klima, meaning "slope," referring to the slope or inclination of the Earth's axis. The first distinct climate treaties were the works of Hippocrates, who wrote Airs, Water and Places in 400 B.C.E.

== Different approach ==
[[Image:Annual Average Temperature Map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the average temperature over 30 years. Data sets formed from the long-term average of historical weather parameters are sometimes called a "climatology".]]

Climatology is approached in various ways such as '''[[Paleoclimatology]],''' which seeks to reconstruct past climates by examining records such as [[ice cores]] and [[growth ring|tree rings]] ([[dendroclimatology]]).  '''[[Paleotempestology]]''' uses these same records to help determine hurricane frequency over millennia.  The study of contemporary climates incorporates meteorological data accumulated over many years, such as records of rainfall, temperature and atmospheric composition. Knowledge of the atmosphere and its dynamics is also embodied in [[model (abstract)|models]], either [[statistical model|statistical]] or [[mathematical model|mathematical]], which help by integrating different observations and testing how they fit together. Modeling is used for understanding past, present and potential future climates. '''[[Historical climatology]]''' is the study of climate as related to human history and thus focuses only on the last few thousand years.

Climate research is made difficult by the large scale, long time periods, and complex processes which govern climate. Climate is governed by physical laws which can be expressed as [[differential equations]]. These equations are coupled and nonlinear, so that approximate solutions are obtained by using numerical methods to create [[global climate model]]s.  Climate is sometimes modeled as a [[stochastic process]] but this is generally accepted as an approximation to processes that are otherwise too complicated to analyze.

== Indices ==
{{see also|El Niño–Southern Oscillation|Interdecadal Pacific oscillation|Madden–Julian oscillation|North Atlantic oscillation|Pacific decadal oscillation}}
Scientists use climate indices based on several climate patterns (known as [[mode of variability|modes of variability]]) in their attempt to characterize and understand the various climate mechanisms that culminate in our daily weather. Much in the way the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], which is based on the stock prices of 30 companies, is used to represent the fluctuations in the stock market as a whole, climate indices are used to represent the essential elements of climate. Climate indices are generally devised with the twin objectives of simplicity and completeness, and each index typically represents the status and timing of the climate factor it represents. By their very nature, indices are simple, and combine many details into a generalized, overall description of the atmosphere or ocean which can be used to characterize the factors which impact the global climate system.

=== El Niño–Southern Oscillation ===
[[Image:El_Nino_regional_impacts.png|thumb|120px|El Niño impacts]]
[[Image:La Nina regional impacts.gif|thumb|120px|La Niña impacts]]

El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a global coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon.  The Pacific Ocean signatures, El Niño and La Niña are important temperature fluctuations in surface waters of the tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean. The name El Niño, from the Spanish for "the little boy", refers to the [[Christ child]], because the phenomenon is usually noticed around [[Christmas]] time in the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/mrd/elnino.html |title=El Niño Information |website=California Department of Fish and Game, Marine Region |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-21 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070621215045/http://www.dfg.ca.gov/mrd/elnino.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; La Niña means "the little girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.advanced.org/20901/la_nina.htm|title=La Niña.|website=Advanced.org|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their effect on climate in the subtropics and the tropics are profound. The atmospheric signature, the Southern Oscillation (SO) reflects the monthly or seasonal fluctuations in the air pressure difference between [[Tahiti]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. The most recent occurrence of El Niño started in September 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WEATHER/09/13/weather.nino.reut/index.html|title=El Nino forms in Pacific Ocean |publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and lasted until early 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/28/tech/main2523483.shtml |title=There Goes El Nino, Here Comes La Nina |work=Associated Press |publisher= CBS News |date=February 28, 2007 |accessdate=March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ENSO is a set of interacting parts of a single global system of coupled ocean-atmosphere climate fluctuations that come about as a consequence of oceanic and atmospheric circulation. ENSO is the most prominent known source of inter-annual variability in weather and climate around the world.  The cycle occurs every two to seven years, with El Niño lasting nine months to two years within the longer term cycle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ensofaq.shtml#HOWOFTEN|title=ENSO FAQ: How often do El Niño and La Niña typically occur?|accessdate=July 26, 2009|date=December 19, 2005|author=[[Climate Prediction Center]]|publisher=[[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; though not all areas globally are affected. ENSO has signatures in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

In the Pacific, during major warm events, El Niño warming extends over much of the tropical Pacific and becomes clearly linked to the SO intensity. While ENSO events are basically in phase between the Pacific and Indian Oceans, ENSO events in the Atlantic Ocean lag behind those in the Pacific by 12–18 months. Many of the countries most affected by ENSO events are developing countries within tropical sections of continents with economies that are largely dependent upon their agricultural and fishery sectors as a major source of food supply, employment, and foreign exchange.&lt;ref name="Pearcy1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearcy |first=W. G. |authorlink= |author2=Schoener, A. |year=1987 |title=Changes in the marine biota coincident with the 1982–83 El Niño in the northeastern subarctic Pacific Ocean |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=92 |issue=C13 |pages=14417–14428 |id= |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1987/JC092iC13p14417.shtml |accessdate= |quote=|doi=10.1029/JC092iC13p14417 |bibcode=1987JGR....9214417P}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New capabilities to predict the onset of ENSO events in the three oceans can have global socio-economic impacts. While ENSO is a global and natural part of the Earth's climate, whether its intensity or frequency may change as a result of global warming is an important concern. Low-frequency variability has been evidenced: the quasi-decadal oscillation (QDO). Inter-decadal (ID) modulation of ENSO (from PDO or IPO) might exist. This could explain the so-called protracted ENSO of the early 1990s.

=== Madden–Julian oscillation ===
[[Image:MJO 5-day running mean through 1 Oct 2006.png|thumb|right|120px|Note how the MJO moves eastward with time.]]
The Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) is an equatorial traveling pattern of anomalous rainfall that is planetary in scale.  It is characterized by an eastward progression of large regions of both enhanced and suppressed tropical rainfall, observed mainly over the Indian and Pacific Oceans.  The anomalous rainfall is usually first evident over the western Indian Ocean, and remains evident as it propagates over the very warm ocean waters of the western and central tropical Pacific. This pattern of tropical rainfall then generally becomes very nondescript as it moves over the cooler ocean waters of the eastern Pacific but reappears over the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The wet phase of enhanced convection and precipitation is followed by a dry phase where convection is suppressed. Each cycle lasts approximately 30–60 days.  The MJO is also known as the 30- to 60-day oscillation, 30- to 60-day wave, or the intraseasonal oscillation.

=== North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) ===
Indices of the NAO are based on the difference of normalized sea level pressure (SLP) between Ponta Delgada, Azores and Stykkisholmur/Reykjavik, Iceland.  The SLP anomalies at each station were normalized by division of each seasonal mean pressure by the long-term mean (1865–1984) standard deviation.  Normalization is done to avoid the series of being dominated by the greater variability of the northern of the two stations.  Positive values of the index indicate stronger-than-average westerlies over the middle latitudes.&lt;ref name="CLIINDEX"&gt;National Center for Atmospheric Research. [http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/jhurrell/indices.info.html Climate Analysis Section.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622232926/http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/jhurrell/indices.info.html |date=2006-06-22 }} Retrieved on June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern Annular Mode (NAM) or Arctic oscillation (AO) ===
The NAM, or AO, is defined as the first EOF of northern hemisphere winter SLP data from the tropics and subtropics. It explains 23% of the average winter (December–March) variance, and it is dominated by the NAO structure in the Atlantic.  Although there are some subtle differences from the regional pattern over the Atlantic and Arctic, the main difference is larger amplitude anomalies over the North Pacific of the same sign as those over the Atlantic.  This feature gives the NAM a more annular (or zonally symmetric) structure.&lt;ref name="CLIINDEX"/&gt;

=== Northern Pacific (NP) Index ===
The NP Index is the area-weighted sea level pressure over the region 30N–65N, 160E–140W.&lt;ref name="CLIINDEX"/&gt;

=== Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) ===
The PDO is a pattern of Pacific [[climate variability]] that shifts phases on at least inter-decadal time scale, usually about 20 to 30 years. The PDO is detected as warm or cool surface waters in the Pacific Ocean, north of 20°&amp;nbsp;N.  During a "warm", or "positive", phase, the west Pacific becomes cool and part of the eastern ocean warms; during a "cool" or "negative" phase, the opposite pattern occurs.  The mechanism by which the pattern lasts over several years has not been identified; one suggestion is that a thin layer of warm water during summer may shield deeper cold waters. A PDO signal has been reconstructed to 1661 through tree-ring chronologies in the [[Baja California]] area.

=== Interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) ===
The Interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO or ID) display similar [[sea surface temperature]] (SST) and sea level pressure patterns to the PDO, with a cycle of 15–30 years, but affects both the north and south Pacific. In the tropical Pacific, maximum SST anomalies are found away from the equator. This is quite different from the quasi-decadal oscillation (QDO) with a period of 8–12 years and maximum SST anomalies straddling the equator, thus resembling ENSO.

== Models ==
{{Main|Climate models}}
Climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice.  They are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system to projections of future climate.  All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any unbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.

The most talked-about models of recent years have been those relating temperature to emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] (see [[greenhouse gas]]). These models predict an upward trend in the [[surface temperature record]], as well as a more rapid increase in temperature at higher latitudes.

Models can range from relatively simple to quite complex:
* A simple radiant heat transfer model that treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy
* this can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models), or horizontally
* finally, (coupled) atmosphere–ocean–[[sea ice]] '''global climate models''' discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange.

== Differences with meteorology ==
In contrast to [[meteorology]], which focuses on short term [[weather]] systems lasting up to a few weeks, climatology studies the frequency and trends of those systems. It studies the periodicity of weather events over years to millennia, as well as changes in long-term average weather patterns, in relation to atmospheric conditions. [[:Category:climatologists|Climatologists]] study both the nature of climates – local, regional or global – and the natural or human-induced factors that cause climates to change. Climatology considers the past and can help [[prediction|predict]] future [[climate change]].

Phenomena of climatological interest include the [[atmospheric boundary layer]], [[atmospheric circulation|circulation patterns]], [[heat transfer]] ([[thermal radiation|radiative]], [[convection|convective]] and [[latent heat flux|latent]]), interactions between the atmosphere and the oceans and land surface (particularly vegetation, [[land use]] and [[topography]]), and the chemical and physical composition of the atmosphere.

== Use in weather forecasting ==
{{Main|Weather forecasting}}
A more complicated way of making a forecast, the analog technique requires remembering a previous weather event which is expected to be mimicked by an upcoming event.  What makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/fcst/mth/oth.rxml Other Forecasting Methods:  climatology, analogue and numerical weather prediction.] Retrieved on February 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some call this type of forecasting '''pattern recognition''', which remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans with knowledge of how satellite imagery relates to precipitation rates over land,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth C. Allen. [http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADP006190 Pattern Recognition Techniques Applied to the NASA-ACTS Order-Wire Problem.] Retrieved on February 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future.  A variation on this theme is used in Medium Range forecasting, which is known as [[teleconnection]]s, when you use systems in other locations to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime.&lt;ref&gt;Weather Associates, Inc. [http://www.weatherassociates.com/courses.htm The Role of Teleconnections &amp; Ensemble Forecasting in Extended- to Medium-Range Forecasting.] Retrieved on February 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  One method of using teleconnections are by using climate indices such as ENSO-related phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Thinkquest.org.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11230">'''The Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses''', commonly referred to as the UN Watercourses Convention, is an international treaty, adopted by the [[United Nations]] on 21 May 1997, pertaining to the uses and conservation of all waters that cross international boundaries, including both surface and [[groundwater]]. "Mindful of increasing demands for water and the impact of human behavior", the UN drafted the document to help [[Water conservation|conserve]] and manage [[water resources]] for present and future generations. From the time of its drafting, the Convention took more than 17 years to enter into force on 17 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-12&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en Current Status of Convention], United Nations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CN/2014/CN.271.2014-Eng.pdf "Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses: Entry into Force"], 19 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; With the treaty having been ratified by just 36 states, the majority of countries, especially the key ones, remain outside its scope. The convention, however, is regarded as an important step in establishing international law governing water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Raj | first1 = Krishna |last2 = Salman | first2 = Salman M.A. | chapter = International Groundwater Law and the World Bank Policy for Projects on Transboundary Groundwater | editor1-last = Salman | editor1-first = Salman M.

In northern hemisphere autumn of 2008, the UN began reviewing a law proposed by the [[International Law Commission]] to serve similar purpose to the unratified document, but was considering adopting the proposal as guideline rather than immediately attempting to draft it into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Can legislation stop the wells running dry? | date = 8 November 2008 | first = Catherine | last = Brahic | issue = 2681 | journal = New Scientist | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026814.000-can-legislation-stop-the-wells-running-dry.html?full=true | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[International Law Commission]] (ILC) was requested by the United Nations in 1970 to prepare viable international guidelines for water use comparable to [[The Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers]], which had been approved by the [[International Law Association]] in 1966 but which failed to address [[aquifer]]s that were not connected to a [[drainage basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McCaffrey | first = Stephen M. | chapter = International Groundwater Law: Evolution and Context | editor1-last = Salman | editor1-first = Salman M.

==Provisions==
The document sought to impose upon [[United Nations member states|UN member states]] an obligation to consider the impact of their actions on other states with an interest in a water resource and to equitably share the resource, mindful of variant factors such as population size and availability of other resources.

Each member state that shares in a resource is required to provide information to other sharing states about the condition of the watercourse and about their planned uses for it, allowing sufficient time for other sharing states to study the use and object if the use is perceived to be harmful. The document permits a state with urgent need to immediately utilize a watercourse, providing that it notifies sharing states both of the use and the urgency. In the event that a use is perceived to be harmful, it requires member states to negotiate a mutually acceptable solution, appealing for arbitration as necessary to uninvolved states or international organizations such as the [[International Court of Justice]].

The treaty also requires states to take reasonable steps to control damage, such as caused by [[water pollution|pollution]] or the introduction of species not native to the watercourse, and imposes an obligation on states that damage a shared water resource to take steps to remedy the damage or to compensate sharing states for the loss. It includes provisions for managing natural damage to waterways, such as caused by [[drought]] or [[erosion]], and mandated that sharing states notify others immediately of emergency conditions related to the watercourse that may affect them, such as [[flood]]ing or [[waterborne diseases]].

==Article 7 controversy==
Article 7 of the document, entitled, "Obligation not to cause significant harm," requires that member states "in utilizing an international watercourse in their territories ... take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse states" and compensate sharing states for any such harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/8_3_1997.pdf | title = Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses | year = 1997 | accessdate = 2009-02-12 | publisher = United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stephen McCaffrey of the [[McGeorge School of Law]], this is "the most controversial provision" of the Convention, with conflict stemming from the fact that a state may have legitimate uses for a watercourse in its nation that can negatively impact other nations.&lt;ref name=McC20&gt;McCaffrey, "Chapter 2: The UN Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses",  20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; He offers the following example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose ... upstream State A has not significantly developed its water resources because of its mountainous terrain. The topography of the downstream states on the watercourse, B and C, is flatter, and they have used the watercourse extensively for irrigation for centuries, if not millennia. State A now wishes to develop its water resources for hydroelectric and agricultural purposes. States B and C cry foul, on the ground that this would significantly harm their established uses.&lt;ref name=McC20/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
McCaffrey indicates that controversy here stemmed from the UN's adaptation of text by the ILC with the intention of strengthening the obligation to do no harm, as the ILC's language more heavily emphasized the "equitable utilization", or balance of the various needs of the states.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, "Chapter 2: The UN Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses", 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dictionnaire Bouillet''''' is the informal title of the '''''Dictionnaire universel d'histoire et de géographie''''' ("Universal Dictionary of History and Geography"), a French reference work in the [[public domain]]. The first edition was published in 1842; the 34th and final edition was published in 1914. 
The original authors were Marie-Nicolas Bouillet (d. 1865) and [[Alexis Chassang]] (1827–78).

==Neutrality of later editions==
Editions after 1852 were amended, probably clandestinely and by the typographers rather than the authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=[[L'Intermédiaire des chercheurs et curieux]]|title=Unknown title |date=25 March 1869 |at=col. 149 |issn=0994-4532 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make certain articles less offensive to Christian sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Index Librorum Prohibitorum |year=1948 |url=http://www.cvm.qc.ca/gconti/905/BABEL/Index%20Librorum%20Prohibitorum-1948.htm |accessdate=2015-10-10 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901092447/http://www.cvm.qc.ca/gconti/905/BABEL/Index%20Librorum%20Prohibitorum-1948.htm |archivedate=1 September 2015 |language=French |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for [[Cardinal Ximenes]], the original ''Il était fanatique et cruel'' ("He was fanatical and cruel") was changed to read ''Il était sévère, mais juste'' ("He was tough but fair").&lt;ref name="Larousse"&gt;{{cite book |last=Larousse |first=Pierre |title=Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle |chapter=Dictionnaire Bouillet |year=1866 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;  References to sales of religious indulgences were deleted entirely.&lt;ref name="Larousse"/&gt;

The neutrality of editions after 1842 is therefore open to question when the work touches on Christian themes.

In '''[[Trinidad and Tobago]], you could obtain a learner's permit''' at your 17th birthday. Licenses to drive are commonly referred to in Trinidad and Tobago as Driver's Permits. Driver's Permits are issued by the Licensing Authority, which is governed by the Ministry of Works and Transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mowt.gov.tt/general/homepage.aspx|title=Ministry of Works &amp; Transport |publisher=Government of Trinidad and Tobago}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to legally operate any motor vehicle in Trinidad and Tobago, only when it is on [[public roads|public-owned-roads]], the operator of the motor vehicle '''must''' be in possession of a valid Driver's Permit '''on their person''' and is legally endorsed for that ''class of vehicle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rgd.legalaffairs.gov.tt/laws2/alphabetical_list/lawspdfs/48.50.pdf|title=Production of driving permit or provisional permit.

== Features ==
The Driver's Permit in Trinidad and Tobago features personal information about holder and it is widely accepted as a form of legal photo identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:HC3x7NesSQoJ:www.trinidadexpress.com/news/New_driver_s_permits__for_2011-113431164.html+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=tt|title=New Driver's Permits for Trinidad and Tobago 2011|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-01-14|via=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:HC3x7NesSQoJ:www.trinidadexpress.com/news/New_driver_s_permits__for_2011-113431164.html+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=tt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Driver's Permits in Trinidad and Tobago 
first came as a [[pamphlet|book]] in the 1950s but then progressed to a [[business card|laminated card]] then finally to a [[magnetic stripe card|digital printed card]] with holograms and scanning technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnc3.co.tt/press-release/new-drivers-permit-tomorrow|title=New Driver's Permits|last=|first=|date=|website=CNC3 News|publisher=Caribbean News Channel|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2017-01-17/deliberate-bird-design-permit|title=Deliberate bird design on permit|newspaper=The Trinidad Guardian Newspaper|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obtaining a driver's permit ==

=== First issue ===
A potential applicant must first have attained the age of 17 years, then will visit their nearest Licensing Office. Applications for [[driving licence|driver's permits]] shall be made to the Transport Officer on the approved form and shall be officially accepted by the applicant.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Motor Vehicle and Road Traffic Act 48:50&lt;/ref&gt; The applicant would then be issued a [[learner's permit]] that is usually valid for (1) one year. The applicant would then also receive a date for the first exam that they would have to undergo, which is commonly called "Driving Regulations", which comprises excerpts from both the Highway Code and the Motor Vehicle and Road Traffic Act Chapter 48:50.

Once the applicant was successful in the written exam, the applicant would then receive a date for the practical exam. The practical exam consists of a series of driving maneuvers and a road test that must be completed thoroughly.

Once satisfying the aforementioned conditions, the Transport Officer would issue the applicant with a Driver's Permit.

'''Transaction Code: A'''

=== Renewal ===
Driver's permits can be valid for five (5) -  ten (10) years depending on which is requested by the applicant. For five (5) year permits, the cost is TT$500, and the cost for a ten (10) year permit is TT$1000. These two permits are only distributed to citizens who are under the age of sixty (60) years and are deemed medically fit by a licensed medical practitioner. For those sixty (60) years of age and over, their Driver's permits are issued free of charge. Applicants over sixty (60) years of age but less than sixty-five (65) years of age, three (3) year permits are issued. Finally, for those over sixty-five (65) years of age, two (2) year permits are issued.  All applicants over 60 years of age require a medical endorsement from a licensed medical practitioner.

'''Transaction Code: B'''

=== Endorsements ===
''(See Section Below on Endorsements/Vehicle Classes)''

In order for an individual to operate any vehicle in Trinidad and Tobago they must be endorsed by the Licensing Authority to drive that particular class. With that being said most persons in Trinidad and Tobago are holders of '''''Class 3''' (''Light Motor vehicles). In order for the aforementioned holder to drive any other classes the procedure is as follows.

The applicant would visit the nearest Licensing Authority office and submit an application for the endorsement. Provided that the applicant does not contravene the rules below, they would be given a learner's permit valid for a period of (1) year.

== Disqualification and suspension ==
A Driver's Permit Holder may be disqualified for a number of reasons including:

* If the Transport Officer is not satisfied that the applicant's vision, hearing, bodily and mental fitness (as shown in a [[medical certificate]]) are of a standard that would warrant the issuance of a driving permit and that the applicant is of good character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ttconnect.gov.tt/gortt/portal/ttconnect/!ut/p/a1/jdDBCoJAEAbgp_HqjIqp3QzMzCA0Kt1LKGyrYa7opj1-5k0sa24zfD_8DBCIgJRJm7NE5LxMivdOFhc_UFH3LA33AVqohp7ioO5rpmr0IB6B0F33wNGVjX_SEPG_PH4Z-2f-QEs4A5lj7sqYgGnNAcz02AJhBU-Hn8R2mWomA1LTK61pLT_q_pwJUTVLCSXsuk5mnLOCykJI-CmR8UZANIJQ3Y_R07vpRbuzX59yknw!/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/gortt/wcm/connect/gortt+web+content/TTConnect/Non-National/Role/AVisitor/MovingtoTandT/Obtaining+a+Police+Certificate+of+Character|title=Certificate of Character, Trinidad and Tobago|last=|first=|date=|website=TTConnect|publisher=TTConnect|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if the holder aforementioned can prove his/her medical fitness by means of a test provided by the Transport Officer, the holder would be issued a permit for one year.
* If the holder of a driving permit or provisional permit is advised by a licensed medical practitioner that he is incapable of driving due to a physical or mental incapacity.
* A Magistrate in a court of law can also order that a Driver's Permit be suspended or a person become barred from being issued a Driver's Permit for a stipulated period of time or indefinitely for traffic-related offences including drunk driving, dangerous driving, or driving without a permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ttparliament.org/legislations/b2014h24g.pdf|title=REPUBLIC OF TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO Act No. 5 of 2010 Dangerous Driving and Suspension of Permits|last=|first=|date=|website=Min of Legal Affairs TT|publisher=Government of Trinidad and Tobago|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://rgd.legalaffairs.gov.tt/laws2/alphabetical_list/lawspdfs/48.50.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demerit Points System ==
The demerit points system entails that certain traffic offences and traffic violations will also carry predefined demerit points, in addition to the other penalties i.e. Fixed Penalty Tickets and Imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mowt.gov.tt/general/subcategory.aspx?categoryID=37&amp;subcategoryID=242|title=Ministry of Works &amp; Transport - Traffic Laws - Frequently Asked Questions - Demerit Points System|website=www.mowt.gov.tt|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This system was designed to work closely connected with the Red Light Camera Enforcement and the Speed Camera Enforcement projects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.looptt.com/content/10-things-know-about-demerits-points-system|title=10 things to know about the Demerit Points System|website=www.looptt.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 2017 where thirty-five red light cameras were installed in strategic locations and multiple speed cameras where those infractions usually occurs (i.e. Speeding &amp; Breaking of Traffic Lights) . These systems are totally automated and send the fixed penalty ticket to the registered owner of the vehicle via postage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-11-13|title=Vehicle registration plates of Trinidad and Tobago|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Trinidad_and_Tobago&amp;oldid=810154345|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predefined demerit points allotted for each traffic offences and traffic violations are said to be on par with other international countries for similar types of offences. The demerit points system would be ranging from two (2) to maximum fourteen (14) points, which would remain on your record at the Licensing Authority for a period of three (3) years, then it would be expunged. The individual can check their records online at the official page of the [https://apps.mowt.gov.tt/ Licensing Authority https://apps.mowt.gov.tt/]

=== Main conditions ===
* Drivers holding a permit for under a year from the date of issue, will get their permit suspended when:
** Drivers receive '''seven or more''' demerit points '''within a 12-month period''', they shall be '''disqualified''' from holding or obtaining a driving permit for a period '''one year'''.  
* Drivers holding a permit for '''over a year''' may have their driving license suspended if they receive '''more''' '''than''' '''10 demerit points within a three-year period'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motor Vehicles and Road Traffic Act, Chap. 48:50 Amendment 2017|last=|first=|publisher=Government of Trinidad and Tobago|year=2017|isbn=|location=Trinidad and Tobago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Drivers who receive '''10-14 demerits''' can be '''disqualified''' from holding or obtaining a driving permit for a period of '''six months'''.
** Drivers who receive '''14-20 demerits''' points can be '''disqualified''' from holding or obtaining a driving permit for up to '''one year'''.
** Drivers who receive '''over 20 demerits''' points can be '''disqualified''' from holding or obtaining a driving permit for up to '''two years.''' 
* When a driver is in contravention of more than one traffic law arising out of one incident. The driver would have recorded in his driving permit record:
** Demerit points for the traffic offence that carries the highest number of demerit points.
** Demerit points for only one traffic offence in instances where the traffic offense carry an equal number of demerit points.

=== Disqualification ===
When a driver meets the conditions for their driver's permit to be suspended they can file a Notice to Contest within 15 days of receiving the penalties. The driver would then have to appear before magistrate, the decision of the court would be final.

If the driver decides not to contest and accepts the disqualification, they would have to surrender their license to the nearest Licensing Authority. Failure to do so would result in a fine of five thousand dollars ($5000) and further disqualification of up to a year. If the driver decides to apply for a driver's permit while on suspension they would be subjected to a fine of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) dollars.

After the period of disqualification ends, the driver, must reapply to the Licensing Authority for a driver's permit. Attend a driver's rehabilitation programme approved by the Licensing Authority, then start the process aforementioned in the Obtaining a Driver's Permit section on this page.

== Technology ==
On 13 January 2017, the Licensing Authority unveiled its new drivers permit with the addition of new security features hologram technology. The permits now feature a scannable [[barcode]] that can be used to view the holder's driving details and records. This aims to alleviate the problem of counterfeit driving permits that are prevalent in Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/20170117/features/oops-wrong-hummingbird-on-new-drivers-permit|title=Oops! Wrong hummingbird on new drivers' permit|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Authority also announced its proposal to integrate Permit scanners that Police officers can use to scan the permits and be able to view outstanding warrants or offences that the holder may have.  This system will also be compatible with the [[Point system (driving)|points of merit system]] that was aforementioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.looptt.com/content/citizens-invited-comment-proposed-points-based-driving-system|title=Citizens invited to comment on proposed Demerits Points System|date=2016-09-27|newspaper=Loop News Trinidad and Tobago|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European colonization of the Americas''' describes the history of the settlement and establishment of control of the continents of the Americas by most of the naval powers of [[Western Europe]]. 
[[File:America 1794.png|thumb|Political map of the Americas in 1794]]
[[File:Spanish conquistador style armour 05.jpg|thumb|Spanish conquistador style armour]]
Systematic European colonization began in 1492, when a Spanish [[Columbus's first voyage|expedition]] headed by the [[Italians|Italian]]&lt;!-- As discussed repeatedly on the CC Talk page, Italian is not a modern word. Italy did exist in name, and the words "Italy" and "Italians " were commonly used at the time. See Name of Italy for more etymology --&gt; explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed west to find a new trade route to the [[Far East]] but inadvertently landed in what came to be known to Europeans as the "[[New World]]". He ran aground on the northern part of [[Hispaniola]] on 5 December 1492, which the [[Taíno|Taino people]] had inhabited since the 7th century; the site became the first permanent European settlement in the Americas. Western European conquest, large-scale exploration and colonization soon followed. Columbus's first two voyages (1492–93) reached the [[Bahamas]] and various [[Caribbean islands]], including Hispaniola, [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Cuba]]. In 1497, Italian explorer [[John Cabot]], on behalf of [[Kingdom of England|England]], landed on the North American coast, and a year later, Columbus's [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third voyage]] reached the South American coast. As the sponsor of [[Christopher Columbus's voyages]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] was the first European power to settle and colonize the largest areas, from North America and the Caribbean to the southern tip of South America.

The [[Spain|Spaniards]] began building up their American empire in the [[Caribbean]], using islands such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola as bases. The North and South American mainland fell to the [[conquistador]]s, with an estimated 8 million deaths of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous populations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David P.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 4|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195334029|p=297|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florida]] fell to [[Juan Ponce de León]] after 1513. From 1519 to 1521, [[Hernán Cortés]] waged a [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|campaign]] against the [[Aztec Empire]], ruled by [[Moctezuma II]]. The Aztec capital, [[Tenochtitlan]], became [[Mexico City]], the chief city of what the Spanish were now calling "[[New Spain]]". More than 240,000 [[Aztecs]] died during the [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|siege of Tenochtitlan]]. Of these, 100,000 died in combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Essential History of Mexico: From Pre-Conquest to Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m7VmCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT49&amp;lpg=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the areas that are today [[California]], [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], [[Texas]], [[Missouri]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Alabama]] were taken over by other conquistadors, such as [[Hernando de Soto]], [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado]], and [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]]. Farther to the south, [[Francisco Pizarro]] [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquered]] the [[Inca Empire]] during the 1530s. The de Soto expedition was the first major encounter of Europeans with North American Indians in the eastern half of the United States. The expedition journeyed from Florida through present-day [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[the Carolinas]], then west across the Mississippi and into Texas. De Soto fought his [[Mabila|biggest battle]] at the walled town of Mabila in present-day Alabama on October 18, 1540. Spanish losses were 22 killed and 148 wounded. The Spaniards claimed that 2,500 Indians died. If true, Mabila was the bloodiest battle ever fought between red men and white in the present-day United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clodfelter|first1=Micheal|title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1492-2015, 4th ed|date=2017|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0786474707|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other powers such as [[France]] also founded colonies in the Americas: in eastern North America, a number of Caribbean islands and small coastal parts of South America. [[Portugal]] colonized [[History of Brazil|Brazil]], tried colonizing the [[Atlantic Canada|eastern coasts]] of present-day [[Canada]] and settled for extended periods northwest (on the east bank) of the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]]. The [[Age of Exploration]] was the beginning of territorial expansion for several European countries. Europe had been [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|preoccupied with internal wars]] and was slowly recovering from the loss of population caused by the [[Black Death]]; thus the rapid rate at which it grew in wealth and power was unforeseeable in the early 15th century.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan|title=American Colonies|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780142002100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, most of the [[Western Hemisphere]] came under the control of Western European governments, leading to changes to its landscape, population, and plant and animal life. In the 19th century over 50 million people left Western Europe for the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;David Eltis ''Economic Growth and the Ending of the Transatlantic slave trade''&lt;/ref&gt; The post-1492 era is known as the period of the [[Columbian Exchange]], a dramatically widespread exchange of animals, plants, culture, human populations (including [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]]), ideas, and [[Native American disease and epidemics|communicable disease]] between the American and Afro-Eurasian hemispheres following Columbus's voyages to the Americas.

==Early conquests, claims and colonies==
[[File:Italian explorers.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Italian explorers which played a key role in the European colonization of the Americas (clockwise from top): [[Christopher Columbus]], [[John Cabot]], [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]]]]
Early explorations and conquests were made by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] immediately following their own final [[Reconquista|reconquest]] of [[Iberia]] in 1492. In the 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], ratified by the Pope, these two kingdoms divided the entire non-European world into two areas of exploration and colonization, with a north to south boundary that cut through the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern part of present-day Brazil. Based on this treaty and on early claims by Spanish explorer [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]], discoverer of the [[Pacific Ocean]] in 1513, the Spanish conquered large territories in North, Central and South America.

[[File:Political Evolution of Central America and the Caribbean 1700 and on.gif|thumb|Central America &amp; Caribbean sovereignty 1700–present]]

Spanish conquistador [[Hernán Cortés]] took over the [[Aztec Empire|Aztec Kingdom]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]] conquered the [[Inca Empire]]. As a result, by the mid-16th century, the Spanish Crown had gained control of much of western South America, and southern [[North America]], in addition to its earlier [[Caribbean]] territories. Over this same timeframe, [[History of Portugal|Portugal]] claimed lands in North America (Canada) and colonized much of eastern South America, naming it [[History of Brazil|Santa Cruz and Brazil]].

Other [[Europe]]an nations soon disputed the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas. England and [[Ancien Régime in France|France]] attempted to plant colonies in the Americas in the 16th century, but these failed. England and France succeeded in establishing permanent colonies in the following century, along with the [[Dutch Republic]]. Some of these were on Caribbean islands, which had often already been conquered by the Spanish or depopulated by disease, while others were in eastern North America, which had not been colonized by Spain north of [[History of Florida|Florida]].

Early European possessions in North America included [[Spanish Florida]], [[Spanish New Mexico]], the English colonies of [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] (with its [[List of islands in the Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] offshoot, [[Bermuda]]) and [[New England Colonies|New England]], the French colonies of [[Acadia]] and [[Canada, New France|Canada]], the Swedish colony of [[New Sweden]], and the Dutch [[New Netherland]]. In the 18th century, [[Denmark–Norway]] revived its former colonies in [[Greenland]], while the [[Russian Empire]] gained a foothold in [[Russian America|Alaska]]. Denmark-Norway would later make several claims in the Caribbean, starting in the 1600s.

As more nations gained an interest in the colonization of the Americas, competition for territory became increasingly fierce. Colonists often faced the threat of attacks from neighboring colonies, as well as from indigenous tribes and [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirates]].

==Early state-sponsored colonists==

The first phase of well-financed European activity in the Americas began with the Atlantic Ocean crossings of Christopher Columbus (1492–1504), sponsored by Spain, whose original attempt was to find a new route to India and China, known as "[[Indies|the Indies]]". He was followed by other explorers such as [[John Cabot]], who was sponsored by England and reached Newfoundland. [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] reached Brazil and claimed it for Portugal.

[[Amerigo Vespucci]], working for Portugal in voyages from 1497 to 1513, established that Columbus had reached a new set of continents. [[Cartography|Cartographers]] still use a [[Latinization (literature)|Latinized]] version of his first name, ''America'', for the two continents. Other explorers included [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], sponsored by France in 1524; the Portuguese [[João Vaz Corte-Real]] in Newfoundland; [[João Fernandes Lavrador]], [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real]] and [[João Álvares Fagundes]], in Newfoundland, Greenland, Labrador, and Nova Scotia (from 1498 to 1502, and in 1520); [[Jacques Cartier]] (1491–1557), [[Henry Hudson]] (1560s–1611), and [[Samuel de Champlain]] (1567–1635), who explored the region of Canada he reestablished as [[New France]].

In 1513, [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and led the first European expedition to see the Pacific Ocean from the [[History of the west coast of North America|west coast of the New World]]. In an action with enduring historical import, Balboa claimed the Pacific Ocean and all the lands adjoining it for the Spanish Crown. It was 1517 before another expedition, from [[Cuba]], visited Central America, [[Spanish colonization of the Yucatán|landing on the coast of Yucatán]] [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|in search of slaves]].

[[File:Philip II's realms in 1598.png|thumb|[[Iberian Union]] (1598)]]
These explorations were followed, notably in the case of Spain, by a phase of conquest: The Spaniards, having just finished the ''[[Reconquista]]'' of Spain from Muslim rule, were the first to colonize the Americas, applying the same model of governing their European holdings to their territories of the [[New World]].

Ten years after Columbus's discovery, the administration of [[Hispaniola]] was given to [[Nicolás de Ovando]] of the [[Order of Alcántara]], founded during the ''Reconquista''. As in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[Taíno people|inhabitants of Hispaniola]] were given new landmasters, while [[Roman Catholic religious order|religious orders]] handled the local administration. Progressively the ''[[encomienda]]'' system, which granted tribute (access to indigenous labor and taxation) to European settlers, was set in place.

A relatively common misconception is that a small number of ''[[conquistadores]]'' conquered vast territories, aided only by disease epidemics and their powerful [[knight|caballeros]]. In fact, recent archaeological excavations have suggested a vast Spanish-Indian alliance numbering in the hundreds of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferturperu.info/discovery-the-inca-rebellion-of-1536/ |title=1536 Inca Rebellion unearthed &amp;#124; Peruvian Travel Trends |publisher=Ferturperu.info |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hernán Cortés]] eventually [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|conquered Mexico]] with the help of [[Tlaxcala]] in 1519–1521, while the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquest of the Incas]] was carried out by some 40,000 Incan renegades led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] in between 1532 and 1535.

Over the 1st century and a half after Columbus's voyages, the native population of the Americas plummeted by an estimated 80% (from around 50 million in 1492 to eight million in 1650),&lt;ref name=Histoire&gt;"La catastrophe démographique" (The Demographic Catastrophe) in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; mostly by outbreaks of [[Old World]] [[Infectious diseases|diseases]].

In 1532, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] sent a vice-king to Mexico, [[Antonio de Mendoza]], in order to prevent Cortes' independentist drives, who definitively returned to Spain in 1540. Two years later, Charles V signed the [[New Laws]] (which replaced the [[Laws of Burgos]] of 1512) prohibiting slavery and the ''[[repartimientos]]'', but also claiming as his own all the American lands and all of the indigenous people as his own subjects.

[[File:Cabrera Pintura de Castas.jpg|thumb|Painting depicting a [[Castas]] with his mixed-race daughter and his [[Mulatta]] wife by [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], 1763]]
When Pope [[Alexander VI]] issued the ''[[Inter caetera]]'' bull in May 1493 granting the new lands to the [[Kingdom of Spain]], he requested in exchange an [[Roman Catholic Church and colonialism|evangelization of the people]]. Thus, during [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s second voyage, [[Benedictine]] friars accompanied him, along with twelve other priests. As [[Slavery in medieval Europe|slavery]] was prohibited between Christians, and could only be imposed in non-Christian prisoners of war or on men already sold as slaves, the debate on Christianization was particularly acute during the 16th century. In 1537, the papal bull ''[[Sublimis Deus]]'' definitively recognized that Native Americans possessed souls, thus prohibiting their enslavement, without putting an end to the debate. Some claimed that a native who had rebelled and then been captured could be enslaved nonetheless.

Later, the [[Valladolid debate]] between the Dominican priest [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] and another Dominican [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda]] was held, with the former arguing that Native Americans were beings doted{{what|date=October 2018|reason=explanation of word "doted" for which clarification requested}} with souls, as all other human beings, while the latter argued to the contrary and justified their enslavement.

The process of Christianization was at first violent: when the first [[Franciscan]]s arrived in Mexico in 1524, they burned the places dedicated to pagan cult, alienating much of the local population.&lt;ref name=Histoire2/&gt; In the 1530s, they began to adapt Christian practices to local customs, including the building of new churches on the sites of ancient places of worship, leading to a mix of Old World Christianity with local religions.&lt;ref name=Histoire2&gt;"Espagnols-Indiens: le choc des civilisations", in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007, pp. 14–21 (interview with Christian Duverger, teacher at the [[EHESS]])&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Spanish Roman Catholic Church]], needing the natives' labor and cooperation, evangelized in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] and other Native American languages, contributing to the expansion of these [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]] and equipping some of them with writing systems. One of the first primitive schools for Native Americans was founded by Fray [[Pedro de Gante]] in 1523.

To reward their troops, the ''Conquistadores'' often allotted Indian towns to their troops and officers. Black African slaves were introduced to substitute for Native American labor in some locations—including the [[West Indies]], where the indigenous population was nearing extinction on many islands.

During this time, the Portuguese gradually switched from an initial plan of establishing trading posts to extensive [[colonization]] of what is now Brazil. They imported millions of slaves to run their plantations. The Portuguese and Spanish royal governments expected to rule these settlements and collect at least 20% of all treasure found (the ''[[quinto real]]'' collected by the ''[[Casa de Contratación]]''), in addition to collecting all the taxes they could. By the late 16th century American [[silver]] accounted for one-fifth of Spain's total budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Spain|work = MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/spain.html  |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQDCbGf?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/spain.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century perhaps 240,000 Europeans entered American ports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART "The Columbian Mosaic in Colonial America" by James Axtell] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317092614/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART |date=March 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/67/908.html |title=The Spanish Colonial System, 1550–1800.

==The search for riches==
[[File:Fur traders in canada 1777.jpg|thumb|Fur traders in Canada, trading with people of Indigenous ancestry, 1777]]
Inspired by the Spanish riches from colonies founded upon the conquest of the [[Aztecs]], [[Incas]], and other large Native American populations in the 16th century, the first Englishmen to settle permanently in America hoped for some of the same rich discoveries when they established their first permanent settlement in [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1607. They were sponsored by [[common stock]] companies such as the chartered [[London Company|Virginia Company]] financed by wealthy Englishmen who exaggerated the economic potential of this new land. The main purpose of this colony was the hope of finding gold.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2001"/&gt;

It took strong leaders, like [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]], to convince the colonists of Jamestown that searching for gold was not taking care of their immediate needs for food and shelter and the [[Bible|biblical]] principle that "he who will not work shall not eat" (see [[2 Thessalonians 3]]). The lack of [[food security]] leading to extremely high mortality rate was quite distressing and cause for despair among the colonists. To support the Colony, numerous [[Jamestown supply missions|supply missions]] were organized. [[Tobacco]] later became a cash crop, with the work of [[John Rolfe]] and others, for export and the sustaining economic driver of [[Virginia]] and the neighboring colony of [[Maryland]].

From the beginning of Virginia's settlements in 1587 until the 1680s, the main source of labor and a large portion of the immigrants were [[indentured servants]] looking for new life in the overseas colonies. During the 17th century, indentured servants constituted three-quarters of all European immigrants to the Chesapeake region. Most of the indentured servants were teenagers from England with poor economic prospects at home. Their fathers signed the papers that gave them free passage to America and an unpaid job until they became of age. They were given food, clothing, housing and taught farming or household skills. American landowners were in need of laborers and were willing to pay for a laborer’s passage to America if they served them for several years. By selling passage for five to seven years worth of work they could then start out on their own in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html |title=Indentured Servitude in Colonial America |first=Deanna |last=Barker |date=10 March 2004 |publisher=National Association for Interpretation, Cultural Interpretation and Living History Section |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5klVsFyDj?url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html |archivedate=October 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the migrants from England died in the first few years.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2001"/&gt;

Economic advantage also prompted the [[Darien Scheme]], an ill-fated venture by the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] to settle the [[Isthmus of Panama]] in the late 1690s. The Darien Scheme aimed to control trade through that part of the world and thereby promote Scotland into a world trading power. However, it was doomed by poor planning, short provisions, weak leadership, lack of demand for trade goods, and devastating disease.&lt;ref&gt;John Prebble, ''Darien: the Scottish Dream of Empire'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the Darien Scheme was one of the factors that led the Kingdom of Scotland into the [[Act of Union 1707]] with the [[Kingdom of England]] creating the united [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and giving Scotland commercial access to English, now British, colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Brocklehurst, "The Banker who Led Scotland to Disaster".&lt;/ref&gt;

In the French colonial regions, the focus of economy was on sugar plantations in Caribbean. In Canada the [[fur trade]] with the natives was important. About 16,000 French men and women became colonizers. The great majority became subsistence farmers along the [[St. Lawrence River]]. With a favorable disease environment and plenty of land and food, their numbers grew exponentially to 65,000 by 1760. Their colony was taken over by Britain in 1760, but social, religious, legal, cultural and economic changes were few in a society that clung tightly to its recently formed traditions.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Eccles, ''The Canadian Frontier, 1534–1760'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Choquette, ''Frenchmen into peasants: modernity and tradition in the peopling of French Canada'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious immigration==
[[File:William Penn and the Indians.jpg|thumb|[[Penn Treaty Park|Penn's Treaty]] with the Indians]]

[[Roman Catholics]] were the first major religious group to immigrate to the [[New World]], as settlers in the colonies of Portugal and Spain (and later, France) belonged to that faith. English and Dutch colonies, on the other hand, tended to be more religiously diverse. Settlers to these colonies included [[Anglican]]s, Dutch [[Calvinists]], English [[Puritans]] and other [[nonconformists]], [[Maryland Toleration Act|English Catholics]], Scottish [[Presbyterian]]s, French [[Huguenot]]s, German and Swedish [[Lutherans]], as well as [[Jews]], [[Quakers]], [[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and [[Moravian Church|Moravians]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the cope of heaven: Religion, society, and politics in Colonial America'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many groups of colonists went to the Americas searching for the right to practice their religion without [[religious persecution|persecution]]. The [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century broke the unity of Western [[Christendom]] and led to the formation of numerous new religious sects, which often faced persecution by governmental authorities. In England, many people came to question the organization of the [[Church of England]] by the end of the 16th century. One of the primary manifestations of this was the [[Puritan]] movement, which sought to "purify" the existing Church of England of its offensive residual Catholic rites.

Waves of repression led to the migration of about 20,000 Puritans to [[New England]] between 1629 and 1642, where they founded multiple colonies. Later in the century, the new [[Pennsylvania]] colony was given to [[William Penn]] in settlement of a debt the king owed his father. Its government was set up by William Penn in about 1682 to become primarily a refuge for persecuted English Quakers; but others were welcomed. Baptists, German and Swiss Protestants and [[Anabaptists]] also flocked to Pennsylvania. The lure of cheap land, religious freedom and the right to improve themselves with their own hand was very attractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Chester Miller|title=The First Frontier: Life in Colonial America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Oadlu2cSFUC&amp;pg=PA80|year=1966|publisher=University Press of America|page=80|isbn=9780819149770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forced immigration and enslavement==
{{Main article|Atlantic slave trade}}
[[File:Tobacco cultivation (Virginia, ca. 1670).jpg|thumb|African slaves 17th-century [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], 1670.]]
[[Slavery]] was a common practice in the [[Americas]] prior to the arrival of Europeans, as different American Indian groups captured and held other tribes' members as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these captives were forced to undergo [[human sacrifice]] in Amerindian civilizations such as the [[Aztecs]]. In response to some enslavement of natives in the [[Caribbean]] during the early years, the [[Spanish Crown]] passed a series of [[Laws of Burgos|laws prohibiting slavery]] as early as 1512. A new stricter set of laws was passed in 1542, called the ''New Laws of the Indies for the Good Treatment and Preservation of Indians'', or simply [[New Laws]]. These were created to prevent the exploitation of the indigenous peoples by the ''[[Encomienda|encomenderos]]'' or landowners, by strictly limiting their power and dominion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joaquín García Icazbalceta|García Icazbalceta, Joaquín]] ''"Colección de documentos para la historia de México"'' "Leyes y ordenanzas" (Dada en la ciudad de Barcelona, a veinte días del mes de Noviembre, año del nacimiento de nuestro Salvador Jesucristo de mill e quinientos e cuarenta y dos años) y addenda 4 de junio de 1543; 26 de junio de 1543; 26 de mayo de 1544 [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/06922752100647273089079/p0000026.htm text on Internet] Cervantes Virtual&lt;/ref&gt; This helped curb Indian slavery considerably, though not completely. Later, with the arrival of other European colonial powers in the New World, the enslavement of native populations increased, as these empires lacked legislation against slavery until decades later. The population of indigenous peoples declined (mostly from European diseases, but also from forced exploitation and atrocities). Later, native workers were replaced by Africans imported through a large commercial slave trade.

By the 18th century, the overwhelming number of black slaves was such that [[Amerindian]] slavery was less commonly used. Africans, who were taken aboard slave ships to the Americas, were primarily obtained from their African homelands by coastal tribes who captured and sold them. Europeans traded for slaves with the slave capturers of the local native African tribes in exchange for rum, guns, gunpowder, and other manufactures.

===Slavery===

The total [[slave trade]] to islands in the [[Caribbean]], [[Brazil]], Mexico and to the United States is estimated to have involved 12 million Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ronald |last=Segal |author-link=Ronald Segal |title=The Black Diaspora: Five Centuries of the Black Experience Outside Africa |year=1995 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |isbn=0-374-11396-3 |page=4 |quote=It is now estimated that 11,863,000 slaves were shipped across the Atlantic.

Such diseases yielded human mortality of an unquestionably enormous gravity and scale – and this has profoundly confused efforts to determine its full extent with any true precision. Estimates of the [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|pre-Columbian population of the Americas]] vary tremendously.

Others have argued that significant variations in population size over pre-Columbian history are reason to view higher-end estimates with caution. Such estimates may reflect historical population maxima, while indigenous populations may have been at a level somewhat below these maxima or in a moment of decline in the period just prior to contact with Europeans. Indigenous populations hit their ultimate lows in most areas of the Americas in the early 20th century; in a number of cases, growth has returned.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, pp. xvii, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of colonial land ownership on long-term development==

Geographic differences between the colonies played a large determinant in the types of political and economic systems that later developed. In their paper on institutions and long-run growth, economists [[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]], and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]] argue that certain natural endowments gave rise to distinct colonial policies promoting either smallholder or coerced labor production.&lt;ref&gt;Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson, “Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth,” Handbook of Economic Growth 1: 385-472. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Densely settled populations, for example, were more easily exploitable and profitable as slave labor. In these regions, landowning elites were economically incentivized to develop forced labor arrangements such as the Peru [[mit'a]] system or Argentinian [[latifundias]] without regard for democratic norms. French and British colonial leaders, conversely, were incentivized to develop capitalist markets, property rights, and democratic institutions in response to natural environments that supported smallholder production over forced labor.

James Mahoney, a professor at Northwestern University, proposes that colonial policy choices made at critical junctures regarding land ownership in coffee-rich Central America fostered enduring [[path dependence|path dependent]] institutions.&lt;ref&gt;James Mahoney, “Path-Dependent Explanations of Regime Change: Central America in Comparative Perspective.” Studies in Comparative International Development, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee economies in Guatemala and El Salvador, for example, were centralized around large plantations that operated under coercive labor systems. By the 19th century, their political structures were largely authoritarian and militarized. In Colombia and Costa Rica, conversely, liberal reforms were enacted at critical junctures to expand commercial agriculture, and they ultimately raised the bargaining power of the middle class. Both nations eventually developed more democratic and egalitarian institutions than their highly concentrated landowning counterparts.

==Exhibitions and collections==
In 2007, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of American History]] and the [[Virginia Historical Society]] (VHS) co-organized a traveling exhibition to recount the strategic alliances and violent conflict between European empires ([[England|English]], [[Spain|Spanish]], [[France|French]]) and the Native people living in [[North America]]. The exhibition was presented in three languages and with multiple perspectives. Artifacts on display included rare surviving Native and European artifacts, maps, documents, and ceremonial objects from museums and royal collections on both sides of the Atlantic. The exhibition opened in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]] on March 17, 2007, and closed at the Smithsonian International Gallery on October 31, 2009.

The related online exhibition explores the international origins of the societies of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] and commemorates the 400th anniversary of three lasting settlements in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] (1607), [[Québec]] (1608), and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] (1609). The site is accessible in three languages.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/exhibitions/small_exhibition.cfm?key=1267&amp;exkey=244 |title=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19705">'''The exploration of [[North America]]''' by non-indigenous people was a continuing effort to map and explore the continent of North America. It spanned centuries, and consisted of efforts by numerous people and expeditions from various foreign countries to map the continent. The [[European colonization of the Americas]] followed.

==Pre-Columbian exploration==
{{main|Norse colonization of the Americas}}{{See also|Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact}}
According to the [[Sagas of Icelanders]], [[Norsemen|Norse]] sailors (often called [[Vikings]]) from [[Iceland]] first settled [[Greenland]] in the 980s. [[Erik the Red]] explored and settled southwestern [[Greenland]], which he named to entice potential Icelandic settlers, eventually establishing the [[Eastern Settlement|Eastern]] and [[Western Settlement]]s, which were abandoned around 1350.

[[L'Anse aux Meadows]], an [[archaeological site]] on the northernmost tip of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and a second site in southwestern Newfoundland, are the only known sites of a Norse village in North America outside of Greenland. These sites are notable for their possible connections with the attempted colony of [[Vinland]] established by [[Leif Erikson]] in 1003.

==Age of Discovery and the search for the Northwest Passage==
{{clear}}{{euromericas}}{{further|European colonization of the Americas}}
The Viking voyages did not become common knowledge in the [[Old World]], and Europeans remained unaware of the existence of the [[Americas]] as a whole, until the first decades following the year 1492. Many expeditions were launched from European nations in search of a [[Northwest Passage]] to East Asia (or "the Indies" as the region was called) in order to establish a shorter trade route to China than the [[Silk Road]], a trade route which had become desperately needed and yet exacerbated by the [[Fall of Constantinople]]. Also, the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian crown]] needed an alternative to the Portuguese controlled eastern maritime trade route around Africa to India and East Asia.

[[File:The arrival of Christopher Colombus to America, 1492.jpg|thumb|The arrival of Christopher Colombus to America, 1492]]
On August 3, 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] set sail from the Port of Palos de la Frontera in the [[Province of Huelva]], from the newly ''[[Catholic Monarchs|los Reyes Católicos]]'' coordinated Kingdoms of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], in present-day [[Spain]], financed by Queen [[Isabella I of Castille]].  [[Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage]] of his discovery of the [[Bahamas]], [[Cuba]], and [[Hispaniola]] spread the news across Europe quickly. Columbus rediscovered and explored much of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in his second voyage then discovered both [[Trinidad and Tobago]] on his third voyage whilst skirting the northern [[South America]]n coast. His fourth voyage was spent scanning the [[Central American]] coast. The [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]] opened the [[New World]].

Italian navigator and explorer [[Giovanni Caboto]] (known in English as John Cabot) is credited with the discovery of continental North America on June 24, 1497, under the commission of [[Henry VII of England]]. Though the exact location of his discovery remains disputed, the Canadian and United Kingdom governments' official position is that he landed on the island of Newfoundland. The English presence through Giovanni Caboto was signaled in [[Map of Juan de la Cosa|Juan de la Cosa's map]] of 1500.

In 1499 [[João Fernandes Lavrador]] was licensed by the King of [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and together with [[Pêro de Barcelos]] they reached [[Greenland]] and sighted [[Labrador]] for the first time since Leif Erikson, which was granted and named after Lavrador. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diffie|first=Bailey|title=Prelude to empire: Portugal overseas before Henry the Navigator|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=1960|isbn=0-8032-5049-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjBfEorbZWAC&amp;lpg|ref=Diffie 1960|pages=463–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 the brothers [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real|Miguel Corte Real]] explored and named the coasts of Greenland, Labrador and also Newfoundland, naming "''Terra Verde''" the explored North American coasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diffie|first=Bailey|title=Prelude to empire: Portugal overseas before Henry the Navigator|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=1960|isbn=0-8032-5049-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjBfEorbZWAC&amp;lpg|ref=Diffie 1960|pages=464–465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both explorations were signaled in 1502 [[Cantino planisphere]].

It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia, but rather found what was to Europeans a [[New World]], which in 1507 was named "America", probably after [[Amerigo Vespucci]], on the [[Waldseemüller map]].

==Further nautical explorations==
In 1500, [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] was sent by [[Portugal]] to explore [[South America]]. He is considered to be the discoverer of [[Brazil]].

[[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] sent [[Juan Ponce de León]] from the fledgling colony on [[Hispaniola]] to verify rumors of undiscovered land to the northwest. On April 2, 1513, Ponce de León disembarked on the northeast coast of what he named [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] for the crown. The exact location is disputed, but historians have offered the possibilities of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], [[Ponce de León Inlet]], and [[Melbourne Beach, Florida|Melbourne Beach]]. He encountered the powerful [[Gulf Stream]] and found a passage through the [[Florida Keys]] to land on the southwestern [[Gulf Coast]] of Florida on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Again, the exact location is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Episode 06 Early Maps of Florida" by Robert Cassanello and Kendra Hazen|url = http://stars.library.ucf.edu/ahistoryofcentralfloridapodcast/6/|website = stars.library.ucf.edu|accessdate = 2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is true that Columbus visited Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in 1493, Ponce de Leon was the first known European to reach the present-day [[United States]] mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Episode 06 Early Maps of Florida" by Robert Cassanello and Kendra Hazen|url = http://stars.library.ucf.edu/ahistoryofcentralfloridapodcast/6/|website = stars.library.ucf.edu|accessdate = 2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, 1513, Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] was the first European to see the [[Pacific Ocean]] once he crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. He claimed all the territory touching it for the Crown, later to affect colonization of [[The Californias|Las Californias]].

Around 1519-1521, Portuguese explorer [[João Álvares Fagundes]] explored the coasts of Newfoundland, Labrador and [[Nova Scotia]], with a mission to create colonies.

In 1524, Italian explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] sailed for King [[Francis I of France]] and is known as the first European since the Norse to explore the Atlantic coast of North America. Arriving near the [[Cape Fear River]] delta, he explored the coastlines of present-day states of [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]], entering the [[Pamlico Sound]], and bypassing entrances to the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Believing the [[New York Harbor]] to be a lake, he sailed past [[Long Island]], exploring [[Narragansett Bay]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].

In 1524-1525, Portuguese explorer [[Estevão Gomes]], on behalf of [[Charles I of Spain]], explored present-day [[Nova Scotia]] sailing South along the [[Maine]] coast. Gomes entered [[New York Harbor]] and saw the [[Hudson River]](which he named the "San Antonio River"). Because of his expedition, the 1529 [[Diogo Ribeiro]] world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly.

In 1534, [[Jacques Cartier]] planted a cross in the [[Gaspé Peninsula]], on the Gulf [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and claimed the land in the name of Francis I. In 1535 Cartier explored the [[St. Lawrence river]] and also claimed the region for France.

[[File:Henry Hudson map.JPG|thumb|left|Map of Hudson's voyages to North America.]]
After two failed attempts to reach East Asia by circumnavigating [[Siberia]], [[Henry Hudson]] sailed west in 1609 under the [[Dutch East India Company]]. He, too, passed [[Cape Cod]], Chesapeake Bay and the [[Delaware Bay]], instead sailing up the [[Hudson River]] on September 11, 1609 in search of a fabled connection to the Pacific via what was actually the [[Great Lakes]]. In Hudson's fourth and final voyage, he discovered, mapped, and explored the [[Hudson Strait]], [[Hudson Bay]] and [[James Bay]].

Other major sea-based explorers were Captain [[James Cook]], [[George Vancouver]], and [[Charles Wilkes]].

==Overland exploration of the West==
{{mergefrom|16th century in North American history|date=September 2018}}
===16th to 17th centuries===
There were numerous Spanish explorers and [[conquistadors]] who explored the Southwest of North America (including present-day west and central United States) and cross the continent (east to west) in its southern regions, mainly from the second quarter to the middle of the 16th century, such as [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] and [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]], but also the North American Southeast and south-central regions, s Soto]].

[[File:1814ThompsonMap.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the North-West Territory of the Province of Canada, stretching from the [[Fraser River]] on the west to [[Lake Superior]] on the east. By David Thompson, 1814.]]

In 1608 [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded what is now [[Quebec City]], which would become the first permanent settlement and the capital of [[New France]]. He took personal administration over the city and its affairs, and sent out expeditions to explore the interior. Champlain himself discovered [[Lake Champlain]] in 1609. By 1615, he had travelled by canoe up the [[Ottawa River]] through [[Lake Nipissing]] and [[Georgian Bay]] to the centre of [[Wyandot people|Huron]] country near [[Lake Simcoe]]. During these voyages, Champlain aided the Wendat (aka 'Hurons') in their battles against the Iroquois Confederacy. As a result, the Iroquois would become enemies of the French and be involved in multiple conflicts.

From 1679 to 1682 [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] explored the [[Great Lakes]] region of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and the entire course of [[Mississippi River]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

From 1697 to 1702 [[Eusebio Kino]] explored the [[Sonoran Desert]] and on his journey to the [[Colorado River Delta]] discovered an overland route to [[Baja California]] that was then commonly believed to be an island. In 1683 Kino lead the first European overland crossing of [[Baja California]].

European exploration of [[western Canada]] was largely motivated by the fur trade and the search for the elusive [[Northwest Passage]]. [[Hudson's Bay Company]] explorer [[Henry Kelsey]] has the distinction of being the first European to see the northern [[Great Plains]] in 1690.

===18th century===

[[Anthony Henday]] was the first to have seen the [[Rocky Mountains]], in 1754, but curiously did not mention it in his journals. From his westernmost geographic position (roughly near the town of [[Olds, Alberta]], halfway between [[Calgary]] and [[Red Deer, Alberta]]) the Rockies should have been quite conspicuous, but he was likely trying to disguise the disappointing fact that an unknown range of seemingly impassible mountains now stood between the HBC and the Pacific. [[Samuel Hearne]] found the [[Coppermine River]] in 1769-71 in his failed search for copper ore deposits. Burned by these shortfalls, the HBC largely quit  exploration.

The [[North West Company]], on the other hand, used a business model that required constant expansion into untapped areas. Under the auspices of the NWC, [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] discovered the [[Mackenzie River]] in 1789 and was the first European to reach the North-American Pacific overland, via the [[Bella Coola River]], in 1793. [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] reached the Pacific in 1808 via the [[Fraser River]].

[[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], widely regarded as the greatest land geographer that ever lived, traveled over 90,000&amp;nbsp;km during his lifetime. In 1797, Thompson was sent south by his employers to survey part of the Canada-U.S. boundary along the water routes from [[Lake Superior]] to [[Lake of the Woods]] to satisfy unresolved questions of territory arising from the [[Jay Treaty]] between [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]]. By 1798 Thompson had completed a survey of {{convert|6750|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Grand Portage]], through [[Lake Winnipeg]], to the [[River source|headwaters]] of the [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] Rivers, as well as two sides of [[Lake Superior]].&lt;ref name="vanherk"&gt;Aritha Van Herk, ''Travels with Charlotte'', Canadian Geographic Magazine, July/August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798, the company sent him to [[Red Deer Lake (Alberta)|Red Deer Lake]] (in present-day [[Alberta]]) to establish a trading post. The English translation of [[Lac la Biche (Alberta)|Lac La Biche]]-Red Deer Lake-first appeared on the Mackenzie map of 1793.&lt;ref name=AlbertaAtlas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Projects/Alberta-Lakes/view/?region=Peace%20and%20Athabasca%20Region&amp;basin=Athabasca%20River%20Basin&amp;lake=Lac%20La%20Biche&amp;number=1|publisher=University of Alberta|location=Edmonton, Alberta|title=Lac La Biche 2004-5|series=Atlas of Alberta Lakes|year=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102003742/http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Projects/Alberta-Lakes/view/?region=Peace%20and%20Athabasca%20Region&amp;basin=Athabasca%20River%20Basin&amp;lake=Lac%20La%20Biche&amp;number=1|archivedate=2013-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson spent the next few seasons trading based in Fort George (now in [[Alberta]]), and during this time led several expeditions into the [[Rocky Mountains]]. In 1811/1812 he followed the [[Columbia River]] to the Pacific, and in 1814 used his notes and measurements to draft the first European-style map of [[western Canada]], covering 3.9 million square kilometres.

===19th century to present===
[[Lewis and Clark]] were the first Americans to venture into the newly acquired territory of the [[Louisiana Purchase]], at the order of President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. They discovered many new geographical features, Indian tribes, and animal and plant species. [[John Colter]] was a member of the expedition who subsequently became a guide for others in the 'Old West,' and did some explorations of his own.

[[John C. Frémont]] led many important explorations in the [[Great Plains]], [[Great Basin]], [[History of Oregon|Oregon territory]], and Mexican [[Alta California]].

[[Joseph Reddeford Walker]] was one of the most prominent of the explorers, and charted many new paths through the West, which often were then utilized by emigrants crossing to settle in Western towns and communities. In 1833, his exploring party discovered a route along the [[Humboldt River]] across present-day [[Nevada]], ascending the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] following the [[Carson River]] and descending via [[Stanislaus River]] drainages to [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]. His return route across the southern Sierra was via [[Walker Pass]], named after Walker by [[John Charles Fremont]]. The approach of the Sierra via the Carson River route later became known as the [[California Trail]], the primary route for the emigrants to the [[gold]] fields during the [[California gold rush]].

As the American population of the West increased, the US government launched ongoing official explorations mainly through the [[US Army Corps of Topographical Engineers]]. One of the main officers and explorers in this unit was [[George Wheeler (explorer)|George Wheeler]]. In 1872, the [[US Congress]] authorized an ambitious plan to map the portion of the United States west of the [[100th meridian west|100th meridian]] at a scale of 8&amp;nbsp;miles to the inch. This plan necessitated what became known as the [[Wheeler Survey]], along with the [[Clarence King]] and [[John Wesley Powell]] Surveys, and expeditions by [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden]]. In 1879, all such efforts were reorganized as the [[United States Geological Survey]].

'''''GIS Live DVD''''' is a type of the thematic [[Live CD]] containing [[GIS]]/[[Remote sensing|RS]] applications and related tutorials, and sample data sets. The general sense of a ''GIS Live DVD'' is to demonstrate the power of [[FLOSS]] GIS and encourage users to start on FLOSS GIS. However, a disc can be used for GIS [[data processing]] and training, too. A disc usually includes some selected [[Linux]]-based or [[Wine (software)]]-enabled [[Windows]] applications for GIS and [[Remote sensing|Remote Sensing]] use. Using this disc the end users can execute GIS functions to get experience in [[free and open source software]] solutions or solve some simple business operations. The set-up and the operating behaviour of the applications can also be studied prior to building real FLOSS GIS-based systems. Recently a LiveDVD image is stored and booted from USB ([[Live USB]]).

==Use cases==
There can be multiple use cases:
* '''Demonstration''' of one or more [[GIS]] applications or data&lt;br /&gt;The disc contains preconfigured applications with some GIS data and introductory tutorials. It is used at workshops or meetings to demonstrate the capabilities of one or more  GIS applications or data sets or results of projects that applied [[FLOSS]] GIS. It makes possible the stand-alone operation using the pre-installed tutorial and sample data. The performance is critical especially the time behaviour. Usually a demonstration disc tends to promote a project so the user friendliness and correctness are critical too.
* '''Evaluation '''of GIS applications&lt;br /&gt;The objective is to provide a simple use and compact  environment for evaluating and/or benchmarking applications or data sets. It has a similar built to a demonstration disc however it needs more flexibility in using external data and access to network. The time behaviour and the performance is less critical since is highly likely the disc is run in a [[virtual machine]]. The user-friendliness is less important since the evaluation is done by professional usually. 
* '''Education'''&lt;br /&gt;Primary aim of this disc is to support of certain GIS training that is based on an established curricula. It can be university education or a special training course. The selection of the applications for the disc supports the gathering of the targeted skill. The disc includes the agenda of the course too. Networking and using peripherals such as printer and external disks is important. 
* '''Installation'''&lt;br /&gt; The goal is support the installation  of [[WEB]] or [[Desktop metaphor|Desktop]] applications by users do not have the required skills or the configuration is complex or difficult. 
* '''Development Kit''' for implementing complex customised applications&lt;br /&gt; The goal is provide a package of a tools for GIS/[[Location Information Server|LIS]] application development that includes standard software components and business related sample models and codes to support and speed up implementation. The emphases is on the demonstration of system integration and the sample databases and software codes and instruction. 
* '''GIS data processing'''&lt;br /&gt; Theoretically a Thematic Live DVD can be used for supporting real business procedures. A USB version of a Live DVD can be adopted to data collection where it includes a specific set-up, e.g. an IT system for spatial related census.

==Creation==
The creation is usually based on an existing [[Live CD]]. Some of the GIS and Remote sensing applications are already included in the basic [[Linux distribution]]. Some other packages has got "ready to install" versions while some others need to be translated from the source code. After having got all applications and related contents (e.g. documentations, sample data) installed the image of the Live DVD is create by the basic distribution provided tools.

==Risks and assumptions ==
The CASCADOSS research project has identified the following risks of disc creation&lt;ref name="Cascadoss LIVEDVD Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cascadoss.eu/en/PDFs/D4.6_LiveDVD.pdf|format=PDF|title=Cascadoss LiveDVD Report|publisher=Cascadoss.eu|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shortages of the Incomplete Applications &lt;br /&gt; The developments of several FLOSS products are not completed. There are some never finished products too. However these incomplete products can have extremely useful functionality that makes use in environmental GIS data processing. By adding them to a disc their weaknesses could not be fixed. Moreover, in case of some old products the incompatibility, e.g. [[Linux]] [[Linux kernel|kernel]] is a real risk.
* Coexistence Problems &lt;br /&gt; In order to create a disc that includes several applications various sub-packages needs to be installed. These packages are not necessarily compatible. They have different technical approach and quality. Therefore, some products cannot coexist smoothly (or at all) with the others on the same [[Linux distribution]].
* Difficulties with Closed Package Dependent Applications &lt;br /&gt; When the code of an FLOSS product is open then errors and reasons can be identified, the code can be corrected and the binary version can be recompiled. However, there are some closed packages, e.g. Sun’s Java Runtime Environment that cannot be diagnosed or modified. Therefore, some [[Java (programming language)|Java]] based and closed package dependent application cannot be installed.
* Difficulties Proprietary Hardware Drivers &lt;br /&gt; Several hardware drivers, e.g. video, wireless, printer are proprietary software. The standard Linux drivers can not necessarily manage them correctly. Therefore, it is impossible to create a disc that compatible with all [[Personal Computer|PC]]s. Especially the notebooks could have problem in running a LiveDVD.
* Difficulties with Obsolete Hardware &lt;br /&gt; The [[Linux]] [[Linux kernel|kernel]] is continuously evolving so some older hardware are not supported in a standard way so it is not possible to support them on a disc.
* Legal Risks (a plethora of different FLOSS licences) &lt;br /&gt; The complex dependency of packages can result conflicts of different [[FLOSS]] licences. Several package needs to be changed recompiled and some dependent packages needs to be replaced by a functionally equivalent that can have incompatible licence. Therefore, some FLOSS project could complain for removing their package from the [[Live CD]].
* Licence or Patent violations &lt;br /&gt; Some FLOSS products depend on proprietary package some others have code that can violate patents or related rights of some firms. Since the broad national differences in related rights the violation depends on where the [[Live CD]] is run. Therefore, some right owners could complain for removing some package from the [[Live CD]].
* Exceeding available room &lt;br /&gt; FLOSS GIS/[[Remote sensing]]/Environmental applications have a large amount of sample, demonstration and training data sets. Installing all the data could easily result too large amount of data that cannot be burnt to a [[CD]] or [[DVD]]. Therefore, some data sets might be excluded from the media.
* Poor [[I18n]] support in the GIS/[[Remote sensing]] applications &lt;br /&gt; The [[I18n]] stands for the internationalization in IT applications. Unfortunately several applications do not care the international use of applications that makes hard or impossible the use of national characters or integrating an application to a national version of an [[operating system]].
* Unfamiliarity of [[Linux]] &lt;br /&gt; Most of the [[Personal Computer|PC]] users are inflexible to turn to any different operating system. Therefore, a [[Linux]]-based application can be strange for them since it has a different habit than well-known products. Moreover, the terminal-based operation is unacceptable for most of the end-users.
* Quality Problems of the Basic [[Linux distribution]] Are Hardy Manageable &lt;br /&gt; As all software products, the [[Linux distribution]]s have bugs and failures. These problems have a direct impact on any [[Live CD]] and cannot be handled as part of a [[Live CD]] creation that is focused on applications and not the functions of the [[operating system]].

==Functions==
The following diagram presents a general [[function–means tree]] of the GIS LiveDVDs:&lt;ref name="Cascadoss LIVEDVD Report" /&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:function_tree_CASCADOSS_LIve_DVD.png
&lt;/gallery&gt;

* Installation &lt;br /&gt; The ability to install comes from the basic [[Linux distribution]] usually. To keep this feature of the basic [[Linux distribution]], the thematic content needs to be stored according to the standards of the basic distribution. As part of the installation, the system makes an update that can spoil the set-up of the added applications.  In order the fully reserve this feature, repositories must be created and regularly maintained for all the installed applications.
* Standard functions of the [[operating system]] &lt;br /&gt; This is usually provided by the basic Linux distribution. Use of resources and peripherals must be adjusted to the needs of the installed application. The tools are available for experienced users to correct the set-up or customise Live CD while it is in use.
* Office applications &lt;br /&gt; This means an [[Office suite]] that makes possible to run slides, editing texts and images.
* GIS application-specific functions &lt;br /&gt; This covers information content, tutorials, user guides, etc. and the functions provided by the GIS applications. It has sense to divide applications to desk top, server and terminal based tools.

A '''gap''' is a land form that is a low point or opening between hills or mountains or in a ridge or mountain range.  It may be called a [[col]], [[Col|notch]], [[Mountain pass|pass]], [[Saddle (landform)|saddle]], [[water gap]], or [[Wind gap (topography)|wind gap]], and [[geomorphology|geomorphologically]] are most often carved by water erosion from a [[freshet]], [[stream]] or a [[river]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=132:8:1224009078693620  GNIS Feature Class Definitions: Gap]&lt;/ref&gt; Gaps created by freshets are often, if not normally, devoid of water through much of the year, their streams being dependent upon the [[meltwater]]s of a [[snow pack]]. Gaps sourced by small [[spring (hydrology)|springs]] will generally have a small stream excepting perhaps during the most arid parts of the year.

[[Water gap]]s of necessity often cut entirely through a [[mountain chain|barrier]] [[barrier ridge|range]] and riverine gaps may create canyons such as the riverine gaps of the [[Danube River]], [[Lehigh River Gorge]], the [[Colorado River]]'s [[Grand Canyon]] and the [[Genesee River]]. Such cuttings may expose millennia of strata in the local rock column writing the [[geologic record]].

The '''''Gazetteer for Scotland''''' is a [[gazetteer]] covering the [[Scottish geography|geography]], [[Scottish history|history]] and [[Scottish people|people]] of [[Scotland]].  It was conceived in 1995 by [[Bruce Gittings]] of the [[University of Edinburgh]] and David Munro of the [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]], and contains 15,500 entries as of January 2008, making it one of the largest Scottish-based web sites.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} It claims to be "the largest Scottish resource available on the web".

Following on from a strong Scottish tradition of geographical publishing, the ''Gazetteer for Scotland'' is the first comprehensive [[gazetteer]] to be produced for the country since [[Francis Groome]]'s ''[[Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland]]'' (1882-6)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/gazetteer/ | title=Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland (6 Volumes) Edited by Francis H. Groome | publisher=Electric Scotland | year=1892-6|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the text of which is incorporated into relevant entries). The aim is not to produce a [[travel guide]], of which there are many, but to write a substantive and thoroughly edited description of the country, including industrial sites, notable architecture and many other features not of [[Tourism in Scotland|tourist]] interest.

Unlike a traditional gazetteer, the ''Gazetteer for Scotland'' has been expanded into an encyclopedia, by including additional entries on famous people, events, Scottish families and family history.  These entries are interlinked, and facilities provided to search and map the online database.  The ''Gazetteer for Scotland'' also includes a simple interface to the historical mapping provided by the National Library of Scotland, and links to other Scottish Government resources, such as listed building information from Historic Environment Scotland and geological maps from the British Geological Survey.  As such, it provides a single portal into a vast array of underlying information.

In terms of [[the web]], the ''Gazetteer for Scotland'' is historically interesting because it is one of the earliest decisions to take what would have been a [[book]] and make it available as a [[website]], realising that the content would grow too much larger than could be economically publishable.  The web medium also permitted many more illustrations than would be possible in print.  A book has, in fact, been published as a later output of this project ''Scotland: An Encyclopedia of Places and Landscape'' (2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munro|first1=David |last2=Gittings |first2=Bruce|title=Scotland: An Encyclopedia of Places and Landscape|year=2006|publisher=Collins|isbn=978-0004724669}}&lt;/ref&gt; which distills the key facts from the ''Gazetteer for Scotland'' database, together with high-quality mapping, into a handy reference form.

The '''General Levelling of France''' (''nivellement général de la [[France]]'' or ''NGF'')
forms a network of benchmarks in mainland France and [[Corsica]], now overseen by the [[Institut Géographique National]]. It is now the official [[levelling]] network in mainland France. It is made up of two networks:
* NGF - IGN69 for mainland France, with the 'zero level' determined by the [[tide gauge]] at [[Marseille]]
* NGF - IGN78 for [[Corsica]], with the 'zero level' determined by the tide gauge at [[Ajaccio]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6586">[[Jordan]] is divided into twelve [[governorate]]s (''[[muhafazah]]''), by the administrative divisions system of the Ministry of Interior. In [[1994]], four new governorates were created: [[Jerash Governorate|Jerash]], [[Ajloun Governorate|Ajloun]], [[Madaba Governorate|Madaba]] and [[Aqaba Governorate|Aqaba]]. Jerash Governorate and Ajloun Governorate were split from [[Irbid Governorate]], Madaba Governorate was split from [[Amman Governorate]] and Aqaba Governorate was split from [[Ma'an Governorate]]. Governorates are further subdivided into districts (''[[Liwa (Arabic)|liwa]]'') and often into sub-districts (''[[qda]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Annex B: Analysis of the municipal sector |work=Third Tourism Development Project, Secondary Cities Revitalization Study |date=24 May 2005 |page=4 |publisher=Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism, Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan |url=http://www.mota.gov.jo/Documents/Municipal_sector.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419052114/http://mota.gov.jo/Documents/Municipal_sector.pdf |archive-date=19 April 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Geographically, the governorates of [[Jordan]] are located in one of three regions: the North Region, Central Region and the South Region. The three geographical regions are not distributed by area or populations but rather by geographical connectivity and distance among the population centres. The South Region is separated from the Central Region by the Mountains of [[Moab]] in [[Karak Governorate]]. The population centres of the Central and North Region are separated geographically by the mountains of [[Jerash Governorate]]. Socially, the population centres of [[Amman]], [[Salt, Jordan|Salt]], [[Zarqa]] and [[Madaba]] form together one large metropolitan area in which business interactions in these cities are under the influence of [[Amman]] while the cities of [[Jerash]], [[Ajloun]], and [[Mafraq]] are mostly under the influence of the city of [[Irbid]].

'''Greektown''' is a general name for an [[ethnic enclave]] populated primarily by [[Greeks]] or people of Greek ancestry, usually in an [[Urban area|urban]] [[neighborhood]].

== History ==
[[File:Griechenkirche Fleischmarkt Wien.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, Vienna|Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Greek Church]] in the Greek quarter in Vienna, late 19th century]]

The oldest Greek dominated neighborhood outside of Greece were probably the [[Fener]] in Istanbul or the [[Shatby|Ash Shatibi]] in Alexandria.

For many centuries in Vienna existed the Griechenviertel (Greek quarter) in the [[Innere Stadt]] (inner town). Later the Greek community moved to other newer quarters. A traditional Austrian restaurant there is called Griechenbeisl (Greek tavern) and a street Griechengasse (Greek lane).

A typical housing pattern found in United States' Greektowns is to buy a multiple story dwelling, move into the lower floor and rent the upper floors to other Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Greek Americans: Struggle and Success |last=Moskos |first=Charles C. |year=1989 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=1412824834 |page=58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=llQax9N3kGMC |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Australia===
The term ''Greektown'' is not widely used in Australia, even in areas with comparatively high levels of Greek concentration. In the 1860s, a shanty town referred to as ''Greektown'' was established at Tambaroora near [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] in New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yTKFBXfCI1QC&amp; ''The Australian People: An Encyclopedia of the Nation, Its People and Their Origins''] by James Jupp ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2001) p.388&lt;/ref&gt; and there is the [[Greek Precinct, Melbourne]]

===In the United Kingdom===
*[[Palmers Green]], London
Many Greeks reside in [[Wood Green]], [[Harringay]] and Palmers Green, the latter harbouring the largest community of Greek-Cypriots outside Cyprus, resulting in these areas bearing local nicknames whereby the ''Green'' is replaced by ''Greek'' &amp;ndash; as in ''Greek Lanes'' and ''Palmers Greek''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.yell.com/find/DoFindLocations/lo/uk+London+Palmers-Green Things you didn't know about... Palmers Green] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026222548/http://www.yell.com/find/DoFindLocations/lo/UK+London+Palmers-Green |date=2008-10-26 }}", ''Yellow Pages''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://uktv.co.uk/food/stepbystep/aid/601903 Greek in Palmers Green]", ''UKTV''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://trustedplaces.com/places/uk/london/palmers+green Palmers Green] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829103708/http://trustedplaces.com/places/uk/london/palmers%20green |date=2009-08-29 }}", ''Trusted Places''&lt;/ref&gt; Although in recent years, most of London's Greek and Greek-Cypriot population resides in [[Southgate, London|Southgate]].

[[Bayswater]] is also home to a substantial Greek community. The [[St Sophia's Cathedral, London|Saint Sophia Cathedral]], situated on Moscow road was built in 1882, and is a grade I listed building.

==Introduction==

===Green infrastructure===
[[Nature]] can be used to provide important services for communities by protecting them against [[flooding]] or excessive heat, or helping to improve [[air pollution|air]], [[soil quality|soil]] and [[water quality]]. When nature is harnessed by people and used as an infrastructural system it is called “green infrastructure”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Benedict, Mark A. &amp; McMahon, Edward T. (2006). Green Infrastructure: linking landscapes and communities&lt;/ref&gt;  Green infrastructure occurs at all scales. It is most often associated with stormwater management systems, which are smart and cost-effective.&lt;ref name="cnt.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnt.org/repository/gi-values-guide.pdf|title=The Value of Green Infrastructure: A Guide to Recognizing Its Economic, Environmental and Social Benefits|date=21 January 2011|publisher=Center for Neighborhood Technology|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, green infrastructure is really a larger concept and is closely associated with many other things. Green infrastructure also serves to provide an ecological framework for social, economic and environmental health of the surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Sprawlwatch Clearinghouse. http://www.sprawlwatch.org/greeninfrastructure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue infrastructure===
{{main article|:Category:Water supply infrastructure}} "Blue infrastructure" refers to urban infrastructure relating to water. Blue infrastructure is commonly associated with green infrastructure in the urban setting and may be referred to as "blue-green" infrastructure when in combination. Rivers, streams, ponds and lakes may exist as natural features within cities, or be added to an urban environment as an aspect of its design. Urban developments on coasts may also have pre-existing features of the coastline specifically employed in their design. Harbours, quays, piers and other extensions of the urban environment may also be added to capture benefits associated with the marine environment. There may considerable co-benefits to health and wellbeing of populations with access to blue spaces in the urban context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bluehealth2020.eu/ |title=BlueHealth |website=BlueHealth |access-date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = grellier2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Grellier|first1= James|last2= White|first2= Mathew P|last3= Albin|first3= Maria|last4= Bell|first4= Simon|last5= Elliott|first5= Lewis R|last6= Gascón|first6= Mireia|last7= Gualdi|first7= Silvio|last8= Mancini|first8= Laura|last9= Nieuwenhuijsen|first9= Mark J|last10= Sarigiannis|first10= Dennis A|last11= van den Bosch|first11= Matilda|last12= Wolf|first12= Tanja|last13= Wuijts|first13= Susanne|last14= Fleming|first14= Lora E|date= 2017|title= BlueHealth: a study programme protocol for mapping and quantifying the potential benefits to public health and well-being from Europe’s blue spaces|url= http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/6/e016188|journal= BMJ Open|volume=7 |issue=6 |pages= |doi= 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016188|access-date= 16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
Some people might expect that green spaces are excessive to maintain and extravagant in nature, but high-performing green spaces can provide real economic, ecological and social benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unepinquiry.org/publication/sustainable-infrastructure-and-finance/|title=Sustainable Infrastructure and Finance - UNEP Inquiry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* [[Urban forestry]] in an urban environment can supplement managing storm water and reduce the energy usage costs and runoff in result.&lt;ref name="cnt.org"/&gt;
* [[Bioretention]] systems can work to create a green transportation system.&lt;ref name="cnt.org"/&gt;
In result, high performing green spaces work to create a balance between built and natural environments.&lt;ref name="cnt.org"/&gt;
*Higher abundance of green space in communities or neighbourhoods is observed to have higher frequencies in participation of physical activity among elderly men.&lt;ref&gt;Gong, Y., Gallacher, J., Palmer, S. Fone, D.(2014)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646136 Neighbourhood green space, physical function and participation in physical activities among elderly men: the Caerphilly Prospective study] ''The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity'' '''11'''(1):40.&lt;/ref&gt;
* More green space around one's house is associated with better [[mental health]].&lt;ref name= BosGr&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bos, E.H.|author2=van der Meulen, L.|author3=Wichers, M.|author4=Jeronimus, B.F.| year = 2016 | title = A Primrose Path?

===Economic effects===
A study in 2012 that focused on 479 green infrastructure projects across the United States, found that 44% of green infrastructure projects reduced costs compared to the 31% that increased the costs. The most notable cost savings were due to reduced storm[[water runoff]] and decreased [[heating]] and [[cooling]] costs.&lt;ref name="citylab.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citylab.com/tech/2012/04/green-infrastructure-could-cities-save-billions/1832/|title=Green Infrastructure Could Save Cities Billions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA-econ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/economics-green-infrastructure |title=The Economics of Green Infrastructure |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-11-02 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Ideas for green urban structures began in the 1870s, with concepts of [[urban farming]] and garden allotments.&lt;ref name="Urban green-blue grids" /&gt; Alternative terminology includes stormwater [[Best management practice for water pollution#Stormwater Management BMPs|best management practices]] (BMPs), source controls, and [[Low-impact development (U.S. and Canada)|low impact development]] (LID) practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Urban Runoff: Low Impact Development |url = http://www.epa.gov/polluted-runoff-nonpoint-source-pollution/urban-runoff-low-impact-development |publisher=EPA |date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green infrastructure concepts originated in mid-1980s proposals for best management practices that would achieve more holistic stormwater quantity management goals for runoff volume reduction, erosion prevention, and aquifer recharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Schueler |first=Tom |date=1987 |title=Controlling Urban Runoff: A Practical Manual For Planning And Designing Urban BMPs |url=https://www.mwcog.org/documents/1987/07/01/controlling-urban-runoff-bmp-stormwater/ |publisher=Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, amendments to the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] introduced new provisions for management of diffuse pollutant sources from urban land uses, establishing the regulatory need for practices that unlike conventional drainage infrastructure managed runoff "at source." Under the Act, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) published regulations for municipalities in 1990, requiring the development of storm water pollution prevention plans and the implementation of "source control practices".&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1990-11-16). [http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/stormwater_phase1_rule.pdf "National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Application Regulations for Storm Water Discharges"]. ''Federal Register,'' 44 FR 47990.&lt;/ref&gt; EPA's 1993 handbook, ''Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention and Control Planning,'' identified BMPs to consider in such plans, including vegetative controls, filtration practices and infiltration practices (trenches, porous pavement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1993 |title=Handbook: Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention and Control Planning |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=30004LY0.txt |publisher=EPA |location=Cincinnati |id=EPA/625/R-93/004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Infrastructure is a concept that highlights the importance of the natural environment in decisions about [[land-use planning]].&lt;ref&gt;The Conservation Fund, Arlington, VA. [http://www.greeninfrastructure.net/ "Green Infrastructure."] Accessed 2009-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Annapolis, MD. [http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/gi/gidoc/gidoc.html ''Maryland's Green Infrastructure Assessment: A Comprehensive Strategy for Land Conservation and Restoration.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309184735/http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/gi/gidoc/gidoc.html |date=2008-03-09 }} May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term does not have a widely recognised definition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/green-infrastructure-and-territorial-cohesion accessed: 09.04.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csc.noaa.gov/magazine/2009/03/article2.html accessed: 09.04.13&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as “blue-green infrastructure”&lt;ref name="Multifunctional green areas"&gt;http://www.ramboll.com/projects/viewproject?projectid=F73AC734-B657-48A0-AE92-0C8A85C8992A accessed: 10.04.13&lt;/ref&gt; or “green-blue urban grids”&lt;ref name="Urban green-blue grids" /&gt; the terms are used by many design-, conservation- and planning related disciplines and commonly feature stormwater management, climate adaptation and multifunctional green space.

The term "green infrastructure" is sometimes expanded to "multifunctional" green infrastructure.  Multifunctionality in this context refers to the integration and interaction of different functions or activities on the same piece of land.

EPA extended the concept of “green infrastructure” to apply to the management of [[stormwater]] runoff at the local level through the use of natural systems, or engineered systems that mimic natural systems, to treat polluted [[urban runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/what-green-infrastructure |title=Basics: What is Green Infrastructure? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-08-12 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the term "green infrastructure" to refer to urban "green" BMPs, although not central to the larger concept, does contribute to the overall health of natural ecosystems.

However, it is apparent that the term “blue-green infrastructure” is applied in an urban context and places a greater emphasis on the management of stormwater as an integral part of creating a sustainable, multifunctional urban environment.&lt;ref name="Multifunctional green areas" /&gt;
&lt;!-- Here is some background to green infrastructure and the rise of the movement. --&gt;

==The role of water: blue spaces and blue infrastructure==
Proximity and access to water have been key factors in human settlement through history.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon S. Water: the epic struggle for wealth, power, and civilization. New York: BMJ Publishing Group, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing drinking water and food, water and the spaces around it create potential for transport, trade and power generation, and provide the human population with resources in terms of recreation and tourism. Many of the world’s largest cities are located near to water sources, and networks of urban "blue infrastructure", such as canals, harbours and so forth, have been constructed to capture the benefits and minimise risks. Globally, cities are facing severe water uncertainties, such as floods, droughts and upstream activities on trans-boundary rivers. The increasing pressure, intensity and speed of urbanisation has led to the disappearance of any visible form of water infrastructure in most cities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/2369268/Water_purificative_landscapes_constructed_ecologies_and_contemporary_urbanism  accessed: 10.04.13&lt;/ref&gt; Urban coastal populations are growing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Neumann|first1= B|last2= Vafeidis|first2= A T|last3= Zimmermann|first3= J|last4= Nicholls|first4= R J|date= |title= Future Coastal Population Growth and Exposure to Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Flooding - A Global Assessment|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118571|journal= PLoS ONE|volume= 10|issue= 3|pages= e0118571|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0118571|access-date= 16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many cities have seen extensive postindustrial transformation of canals, riversides, docks etc. following changes in global trading patterns. The potential implications of such waterside regeneration in terms of public health have only recently been scientifically investigated.&lt;ref name = grellier2017 /&gt; A systematic review conducted in 2017 found consistent evidence of positive associations between exposure of people to blue space and mental health and physical activity.&lt;ref name = gascon2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gascón|first1= Mireia|last2= Zijlema|first2= Wilma|last3= Vert|first3= Cristina|last4= White|first4= Mathew P|last5= Nieuwenhuijsen|first5= Mark J|date= 2017|title= Outdoor blue spaces, human health and well-being: A systematic review of quantitative studies|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463917302699|journal= International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health|volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= 10.1016/j.ijheh.2017.08.004|access-date= 18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One fifth of the world’s population, 1.2 billion people, live in areas of [[water scarcity]]. Climate change and water-related disasters will place increasing demands on urban systems and will result in increased migration to urban areas. Cities require a very large input of freshwater and in turn have a huge impact on freshwater systems. Urban and industrial water use is projected to double by 2050.&lt;ref name="Waterforlife"&gt;https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/swm_cities_zaragoza_2010/pdf/02_water_uncertainties.pdf. accessed: 09.04.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[United Nations]] declared that access to clean water and sanitation is a human right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/facts_and_figures_human_right_to_water_eng.pdf |title=The Human Right to Water (poster) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2011 |website=UN-Water Decade Programme on Advocacy and Communication |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; New solutions for improving the sustainability of cities are being explored. Good urban water management is complex and requires not only water and wastewater infrastructure, but also pollution control and flood prevention. It requires coordination across many sectors and between different local authorities and changes in governance that lead to more sustainable and equitable use of the urban water resources.&lt;ref name="Waterforlife" /&gt;

==Types of green infrastructure==
===Urban forests===
[[Urban forest]]s are forests located in cities. They are an important component of urban green infrastructure systems. Urban forests use appropriate tree and vegetation species, instead of noxious and invasive kinds, which reduce the need of maintenance and irrigation.&lt;ref name="GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES"&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Infrastructure: Cities |url=http://www.asla.org/ContentDetail.aspx?id=43535 |website=American Society of  Landscape Architects |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, native species also provide aesthetic value while reducing cost. Diversity of plant species should also be considered in design of urban forests to avoid [[monocultures]]; this makes the urban forests more durable and resilient to pests and other harms.&lt;ref name="GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES"/&gt;

====Benefits====
* [[Energy use]]: According to a study conducted by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Sacramento Municipal Utility District, it was found that urban trees can provide up to 47% energy savings.&lt;ref name="GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES"/&gt;
* [[Urban heat island]]: Maximum air temperature for tree groves were found to be lower than that of open areas without trees. This is because of a process called evaporative cooling.&lt;ref name="GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES"/&gt;
* [[Water management]]: Urban forests helps with city water management on diverting storm water from water channels. Trees intercept a large amount of rainfall that hit them.&lt;ref name="GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES"/&gt;
* [[Air pollution]]: Trees hold carbon, which improve air quality in cities.&lt;ref name="GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES"/&gt; 
* Property values: Having more trees increases property value, which suggests that people value greenery and trees wherever they are. This implies that trees contribute to the preferred living conditions of people. 
* [[Public health]]: Urban greenery can also improve mental health and well-being.&lt;ref name="GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES"/&gt;
* Creating Urban forest affects Public Health in many ways, as mentioned above urban heat islands are created by the condensation of heat due to the materials and infrastructure used in metropolitan areas, which can negatively impact human health. Urban forests provide natural shading structures at a fraction of the cost of artificial shading structures and it counters the negative health impacts of increasing global temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Robert|date=18 Oct 2011|title=Planting the Living City|url=&lt;dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2011.616996.&gt;|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond countering the negative impacts of man-made infrastructure, green infrastructure has the potential to enhance existing ecosystems and make them more stable, which has been historically done in traditional Japanese agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McHarg |first1=Ian L. |title=The Place of Nature in the City of Man |journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=8 September 2016 |volume=352 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1177/000271626435200102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Green infrastructure in an urbanized area can help restore and enhance the resiliency of an ecosystem to natural disturbances and disasters that disrupt the lives of residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Brian|date=16 Sep 2004|title="Resilience, Adaptability and Transformability in Social–ecological Systems."|url=https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss2/art5/|journal=Ecology and Society |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Building new urban forests in an existing metropolitan area creates new labor jobs that do not require a high level of education, which can decrease unemployment in the working class which benefits society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faulconer|first=Kevin|date=Dec 2015|title=City of San Diego Climate Action Plan|url=http://www.sandiego.gov/sustainability/.|journal=Krout Associates Sustainability Counseling|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, green infrastructure helps states to implement the principles of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development that was designed to alleviate the social and economic consequences of environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=3 June 1992|title=1992-Rio-Declaration-on-Environment-and-Development|url=http://www.cil.nus.edu.sg&gt;|journal=United Nations Division for Sustainable Development|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructed wetlands===
[[Constructed wetland]]s are manmade [[wetland]]s, which work as a bio-filtration system. They contain wetland vegetation and are mostly built on uplands and [[floodplain]]s.&lt;ref name="Constructed treatment wetland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Constructed treatment wetland|url=http://water.epa.gov/type/wetlands/restore/upload/2004_09_20_wetlands_pdf_ConstructedW.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed wetlands are built this way to avoid connection or damage to natural wetlands and other aquatic resources.&lt;ref name="Constructed treatment wetland"/&gt; There are two main categories of constructed wetlands: subsurface flow system and free water surface system.&lt;ref name="Constructed treatment wetland"/&gt; Proper planning and operating can help avoid possible harm done to the wetlands, which are caused by alteration of natural hydrology and introduction of invasive species.&lt;ref name="Constructed treatment wetland"/&gt;

====Benefits====
* [[Water efficiency]]: Constructed wetlands try to replicate natural wetland ecosystems. They are built to improve water efficiency and water quality. They also create [[wildlife habitat]]s by using natural processes of plants, soils, and associated [[microorganism]]s. In these types of wetlands, vegetation can trap parts of suspended solids and slow down water flow; the microorganisms that live there process some other pollutants.&lt;ref name="Constructed treatment wetland"/&gt;
* [[Cost-effective]]: Wetlands have low operating and maintenance costs. They can also help with fluctuating water levels. Aesthetically, constructed wetlands are able to add greenery to its surrounding environment. It also helps to reduce unpleasing odors of wastewater.&lt;ref name="Constructed treatment wetland"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constructed Wetland|url=http://www.2030palette.org/swatches/view/constructed-wetland/esalen_institute_1.jpg|website=Architecture 2030|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green roofs and green walls===
[[Green roof]]s improve air and water quality while reducing energy cost. The plants and soil provide more green space and insulation on roofs. Green and blue roofs also help reducing city runoff by retaining rainfall providing a potential solution for the stormwater management in highly concentrated urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green roof|url=http://www.2030palette.org/swatches/view/green-roof/tu_delft_library_1.jpg|website=Architecture 2030|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shafique|first=Muhammad|last2=Kim|first2=Reeho|date=2017-06-20|title=Retrofitting the Low Impact Development Practices into Developed Urban areas Including Barriers and Potential Solution|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/geo-2017-0020/geo-2017-0020.xml?format=INT|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=240-254|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0020|issn=2391-5447|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social benefit of green roofs is the rooftop agriculture for the residents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Green Alleys ===

[[The Trust for Public Land]] is working in partnership with the City of Los Angeles' Community Redevelopment Agency, Bureau of Sanitation, the [[University of Southern California|University of Southern Californi]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;a's Center for Sustainable Cities, and [[Jefferson High School (Los Angeles)|Jefferson High School]] by converting the existing 900 miles of alleys in the city to green alleys.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/green-alleys#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=Green Alleys|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept is to re-engineer existing alleyways to reflect more light to mitigate heat island effect, capture storm water, and make the space beautiful and usable by the neighboring communities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The first alley, completed in 2015, saved more than 750,000 gallons in its first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/science/climate-change-alley-ways-water.html|title=Los Angeles Looks for Extra Water Down Its Alleys|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Green alleys will provide open space on top of these ecological benefits, converting spaces which used to feel unsafe, or used for dumping into a playground, and walking/biking corridor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/alley-makeover-green-alleys-los-angeles|title=Making Alleys a Place for Play (Not Old Couches)|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;



=== Green School Yards ===
[[The Trust for Public Land]] has completed 183 green school yards across the 5 boroughs in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/media-room/new-york-city-and-trust-public-land-complete-new-green-schoolyard-queens#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=New York City and The Trust for Public Land Complete New "Green" Schoolyard in Queens|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Existing asphalt school yards are converted to a more vibrant and exciting place while also incorporating infrastructure to capture and store rainwater: rain garden, rain barrel, tree groves with pervious pavers, and an artificial field with a turf base.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/green-team-grows-new-schoolyard#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=Green Team Grows New Schoolyard|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children are engaged in the design process, lending to a sense of ownership and encourages children to take better care of their school yard.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Success in New York has allowed other cities like Philadelphia and Oakland to also convert to green school yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/media-room/work-begins-implement-green-schoolyards-oakland#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=Work Begins to Implement Green Schoolyards in Oakland|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/media-room/designed-green-play-south-philly-schoolyard-wins-recognition#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=Designed for green play, a South Philly schoolyard wins recognition|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low Impact Development===
Low impact development (also referred to as green stormwater infrastructure) are systems and practices that use or mimic natural processes that result in the infiltration, evapotranspiration or use of stormwater in order to protect water quality and associated aquatic habitat. LID practices aim to preserve, restore and create green space using soils, vegetation, and rainwater harvest techniques. It is an approach to land development (or re-development) that works with nature to manage stormwater as close to its source as possible. &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Emvironmental Protection Agemcy. [https://www.epa.gov/nps/urban-runoff-low-impact-development”Urban Runoff: Low Impact Development.”&lt;/ref&gt; Many low impact development tools integrate vegetation or the existing soil to reduce runoff and let rainfall enter the natural water cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Philadelphia Water Department. [http://www.phillywatersheds.org/what_were_doing/green_infrastructure/tools”Green Stormwater Infrastructure Tools.”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning approach==
The Green Infrastructure approach analyses the [[natural environment]] in a way that highlights its function and subsequently seeks to put in place, through [[regulation|regulatory]] or planning policy, mechanisms that safeguard critical natural areas. Where life support functions are found to be lacking, plans may propose how these can be put in place through [[landscaping|landscaped]] and/or [[Environmental engineering|engineered]] improvements.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Benedict and Edward T. McMahon (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=2xTJvYqzFNkC&amp;dq=green+infrastructure+McMahon&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=3lScdISNRt&amp;sig=p7e_ZLsXRKVC77WYtzneB7JNN0A&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result ''Green Infrastructure, Linking Landscapes and Communities.''] Washington, D.C.: Island Press. {{ISBN|1-55963-558-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within an urban context, this can be applied to re-introducing natural waterways&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ramboll.com/megatrend/feature-articles/in-the-cities-of-the-future-water-flows-everywhere accessed 11.04.13&lt;/ref&gt; and making a city self-sustaining particularly with regard to water, for example, to harvest water locally, recycle it, re-use it and integrate stormwater management into everyday infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;“Blue-Green Infrastructures”.  (December 13, 2012). Topos, p.18, 21,22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The multi-functionality of this approach is key to the efficient and [[Sustainability|sustainable]] use of land, especially in a compact and bustling country such as [[England]] where pressures on land are particularly acute.  An example might be an urban edge river [[floodplain]] which provides a repository for flood waters, acts as a [[nature reserve]], provides a recreational [[Open space reserve|green space]] and could also be productively farmed (probably through grazing). There is growing evidence that the natural environment also has a positive effect on human health.&lt;ref&gt;Irvine KN, Warber SL. (2002).

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], Green Infrastructure planning is increasingly recognised as a valuable approach for [[spatial planning]] and is now seen in national, [[regional planning|regional]] and [[urban planning|local planning]] and policy documents and strategies, for example in the [[Milton Keynes]] and [[South Midlands]] Growth area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalengland.etraderstores.com/NaturalEnglandShop/NE176|title=Environment Agency, Bristol, UK|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501004035/http://naturalengland.etraderstores.com/NaturalEnglandShop/NE176|archivedate=2011-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, guidance on green infrastructure planning was published by Natural England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/planningtransportlocalgov/greeninfrastructure/default.aspx|title=What is Green Infrastructure?|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307002614/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/planningtransportlocalgov/greeninfrastructure/default.aspx|archive-date=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This guidance promotes the importance of green infrastructure in 'place-making', i.e. in recognizing and maintaining the character of a particular location, especially where new developments are planned.&lt;ref&gt;Natural England website 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[North West England]] the former ''[[Regional Spatial Strategy]]'' had a specific Green Infrastructure Policy (EM3 - Green Infrastructure) as well as other references to the concept in other land use development policies (e.g. DP6).&lt;ref&gt;North West Regional Assembly, Wigan, UK. [http://rpg.nwra.gov.uk/uploads/rpg_docs/rp_kMqZ_Submitted_Draft_Regional_Spati.pdf "The North West Plan: Submitted Draft Regional Spatial Strategy for the North West of England."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612085319/http://rpg.nwra.gov.uk/uploads/rpg_docs/rp_kMqZ_Submitted_Draft_Regional_Spati.pdf |date=2007-06-12 }} January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was supported by the ''North West Green Infrastructure Guide.''&lt;ref&gt;Green Infrastructure Think Tank (GrITT), Warrington, UK. [http://www.greeninfrastructurenw.co.uk/resources/GI_Giude_Sept_07.pdf "North West Green Infrastructure Guide."] September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Infrastructure Think Tank (GrITT) provides the support for policy development in the region and manages the web site that acts as a repository for information on Green Infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;GrITT.

The Natural Economy Northwest programme has supported a number of projects, commissioned by The Mersey Forest to develop the evidence base for green infrastructure in the region. In particular work has been undertaken to look at the economic value of green infrastructure, the linkage between grey and green infrastructure and also to identify areas where green infrastructure may play critical role in helping to overcome issues such as risks of flood or poor air quality.

In March 2011, a prototype Green Infrastructure Valuation Toolkit&lt;ref&gt;Green Infrastructure Valuation Toolkit  - www.ginw.co.uk/projects&lt;/ref&gt; was launched. The Toolkit is available under a Creative Commons licence, and provides a range of tools that provide economic valuation of green infrastructure interventions. The toolkit has been trialled in a number of areas and strategies, including the Liverpool Green Infrastructure Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Liverpool Green Infrastructure Strategy 2010. www.ginw.co.uk/liverpool&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Greater London Authority published the All London Green Grid Supplementary Planning Guidance (ALGG SPG) which proposes an integrated network of green and open spaces together with the Blue Ribbon Network of rivers and waterways. The ALGG SPG aims to promote the concept of green infrastructure, and increase its delivery by boroughs, developers, and communities, to benefit areas such as sustainable travel, flood management, healthy living and the economic and social uplift these support.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/publications/all-london-green-grid-spg accessed 11.04.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Infrastructure is being promoted as an effective and efficient response to projected climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Green Infrastructure to Combat Climate Change - www.ginw.co.uk/climatechange&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Infrastructure may include [[geodiversity]] objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Green Infrastructure Planning in the Black Country: Barrow Hill LNR and Russells Hall Hospital, Dudley - http://www.bcll.org.uk/whats_happening/documents/GreenInfrastructurePlanningintheBCBarrowHillCaseStudy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Green infrastructure programs managed by [[EPA]] and partner organizations are intended to improve [[water quality]] generally through more extensive management of stormwater runoff. The practices are expected to reduce stress on traditional water [[drainage]] infrastructure--[[storm sewer]]s and [[combined sewer]]s—which are typically extensive networks of underground [[pipe (material)|pipes]] and/or surface water channels in U.S. cities, towns and suburban areas. Improved stormwater management is expected to reduce the frequency of [[combined sewer overflow]]s and [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s, reduce the impacts of [[Flood#Urban flooding|urban flooding]], and provide other environmental benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/benefits-green-infrastructure |title=Benefits of Green Infrastructure |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-04-19 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Rivers, Inc., Washington, D.C.; Center for Neighborhood Technology, Chicago, IL (2010). [http://americanrivers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Value-of-Green-Infrastructure.pdf "The Value of Green Infrastructure."]&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of these green infrastructure programs in use is the [[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES).  It was established in 1972 to reduce stormwater runoff pollution across the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/about-npdes |title=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) |publisher=EPA |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by distributing permits to facilities (or groups of facilities) to regulate their allowable point source pollution. Under the [[Clean Water Act]], the NPDES may be managed by localities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-state-program-information |title=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) State Program Authorization Information |publisher=EPA |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which has prompted many cities and counties to delegate [[Best Management Practices]] (BMPs) to local builders for slowing and filtering surface runoff from their projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide to California Planning|last=Fulton|first=William|last2=Shigley|first2=Paul|publisher=Solano Press Books|year=2012|isbn=9781938166020|edition=4|location=Point Arena, CA|pages=424–425|chapter=Structure of Natural Resources Protection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though green infrastructure is yet to become a mainstream practice,&lt;ref&gt;Dhakal K.P. and Chevalier L.R. (2017). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479717307478 "Managing urban stormwater for urban sustainability: Barriers and policy solutions for green infrastructure application."] Journal of Environmental Management. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.07.065&lt;/ref&gt; many US cities have initiated its implementation. For example, the City of [[Philadelphia]] has installed or supported a variety of retrofit projects in neighborhoods throughout the city. Installed improvements include:
* permeable pavements in parks, basketball courts and parking lots
* [[rain garden]]s and [[bioretention]] systems at schools and other public facilities
* [[constructed wetland]]s for management of stormwater runoff.
Some of these facilities reduce the volume of runoff entering the city's aging combined sewer system, and thereby reduce the extent of system overflows during rainstorms.&lt;ref&gt;Philadelphia Water Department.

Another U.S. example is the State of [[Maryland]]'s promotion of a program called GreenPrint. GreenPrint Maryland is the first web-enabled map in the nation that shows the relative ecological importance of every parcel of land in the state.

Combining color-coded maps, information layers, and [[aerial photography]] with public openness and transparency, Greenprint Maryland applies the best environmental science and [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) to the urgent work of preserving and protecting environmentally critical lands.  A valuable new tool not only for making land conservation decisions today, but for building a broader and better informed public consensus for sustainable growth and land preservation decisions into the future.

The program was established in 2001 with the objective to “preserve an extensive, intertwined network of land vital to the long-term survival of our native plants and wildlife and industries dependent on clean environment and abundant natural resources.”&lt;ref&gt;State of Maryland, 2001.

In April 2011, EPA announced the ''Strategic Agenda to Protect Waters and Build More Livable Communities through Green Infrastructure'' and the selection of the first ten communities to be green infrastructure partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/home.cfm?program_id=298 |title=Managing Wet Weather with Green Infrastructure |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517155819/http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/home.cfm?program_id=298 |archive-date=2011-05-17 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/gi_agenda_protectwaters.pdf |title=A Strategic Agenda to Protect Waters and Build More Livable Communities Through Green Infrastructure |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=April 2011 |website=Green Infrastructure |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The communities selected were: Austin, Texas; Chelsea, Massachusetts; the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (Cleveland, Ohio); the City and County of Denver, Colorado; Jacksonville, Florida; Kansas City, Missouri; Los Angeles, California; Puyallup, Washington; Onondaga County and the City of Syracuse, New York; and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/gi_partner_organizations.pdf |title=Green Infrastructure Community Partner Organizations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=April 2011 |website=Green Infrastructure |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) is also promoting green infrastructure as a means of managing [[Flood#Urban flooding|urban flooding]] (also known as localized flooding).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1446-20490-0539/FEMA511-complete.pdf "Reducing Damage from Localized Flooding."] U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
Since 2009, two editions of the ABC (Active, Beautiful, Clean) Waters Design Guidelines have been published by the Public Utilities Board (PUB), Singapore. The latest version (2011) contains planning and design considerations for the holistic integration of drains, canals and reservoirs with the surrounding environment. PUB encourages the various stakeholders — landowners, private developers to incorporate ABC Waters design features into their developments, and the community to embrace these infrastructures for recreational &amp; educational purposes.

The main benefits outlined in the ABC Waters Concept include:

* Treating stormwater runoff closer to the source naturally, without the use of chemicals through the use of plants and soil media, so that cleaner water is discharged into waterways and eventually our reservoirs.
* Enhancing biodiversity and site aesthetics.
* Bringing people closer to water, and creating new recreational and community spaces for people to enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pub.gov.sg/abcwaters/abcwatersdesignguidelines/Pages/ABCDesignGuidelines.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908170227/http://www.pub.gov.sg/abcwaters/abcwatersdesignguidelines/Pages/ABCDesignGuidelines.aspx |archivedate=2013-09-08 |df= }} accessed 11.04.13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other states===

A 2012 paper by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] reviewed evidence of the economic impacts of green infrastructure in fragile states.

Upfront construction costs for GI were up to 8% higher than non-green infrastructure projects. [[Climate Finance]] was not adequately captured by [[Fragile state]]s for GI investments, and governance issues may further hinder capability to take full advantage.

GI Investments needed strong government participation as well as institutional capacities and capabilities that fragile states may not possess. Potential poverty reduction includes improved agricultural yields and higher [[rural electrification]] rates, benefits that can be transmitted to other sectors of the economy not directly linked to the GI investment.

Whilst there are examples of GI investments creating new jobs in a number of sectors, it is unclear what the employment opportunities advantages are in respect to traditional infrastructure investments. The correct market conditions (i.e. labour regulations or energy demand) are also required in order to maximise employment creation opportunities.

Such factors that may not be fully exploited by [[fragile state]] governments lacking the capacity to do so. GI investments have a number of co-benefits including increased [[energy security]] and improved health outcomes, whilst a potential reduction of a country’s vulnerability to the negative effects of climate change being arguably the most important co-benefit for such investments in a fragile state context.

There is some evidence that GI options are taken into consideration during [[project appraisal]]. Engagement mostly occurs in projects specifically designed with green goals, hence there is no data showing decision making that leads to a shift towards any green alternative. Comparisons of costs, co-benefits, [[poverty reduction]] benefits or employment creation benefits between the two typologies are also not evident.&lt;ref&gt;Lemma, A. Green Infrastructure in Fragile States, October 2012, Overseas Development Institute http://partnerplatform.org/?5amvj9gc&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, an international standard for green infrastructure is developed: SuRe® – The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure is a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of sustainability and resilience into infrastructure development and upgrade.&lt;ref name="issuu.com"/&gt; SuRe® is developed by the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) and the French bank [[Natixis]] as part of a multi-stakeholder process and will be compliant with [[ISEAL]] guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gib-foundation.org/sure-standard/|title=SuRe® - The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure - Global Infrastructure Basel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
GIB has also developed the SuRe® SmartScan, a simplified version of the SuRe® Standard which serves as a self-assessment tool for infrastructure project developers. It provides them with a comprehensive and time-efficient analysis of the various themes covered by the SuRe® Standard, offering a solid foundation for projects that are planning to become certified by the SuRe® Standard in the future. Upon completion of the SmartScan, project developers receive a spider diagram evaluation, which indicates their project’s performance in the different themes and benchmarks the performances with other SmartScan assessed projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunwindenergy.com/content/sure-global-infrastructure-standard-sustainable-future&lt;/ref&gt;

===ABC Water Design Guidelines by PUB in Singapore===

Since 2009, two editions of the ABC (Active, Beautiful, Clean) Waters Design Guidelines have been published by the Public Utilities Board (PUB), [[Singapore]]. The latest version in 2011 contains planning and design considerations for the integration of drains, canals and reservoirs with the surrounding environment.

===Stormwater Management, Surrey, British Columbia===

Farmers claimed that flooding of their farmlands was caused by suburban development upstream. The flooding was a result of funneled runoff directed into storm drains by impervious cove, which ran unmitigated and unabsorbed into their farmlands downstream. The farmers were awarded an undisclosed amount of money in the tens of millions as compensation. Low density and highly paved residential communities redirect stormwater from impervious surfaces and pipes to stream at velocities much greater than predevelopment rates. Not only are these practices environmentally damaging, they can be costly and inefficient to maintain. In response, the city of [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] opted to employ a green infrastructure strategy and chose a 250-hectare site called East Clayton as a demonstration project. The approach reduced the stormwater flowing downstream and allows for infiltration of rainwater closer if not at its point of origin. In result, the stormwater system at East Clayton had the ability to hold one inch of rainfall per day, accounting for 90% of the annual rainfall. The incorporation of green infrastructure at Surrey, British Columbia was able to create a sustainable environment that diminishes runoff and to save around $12,000 per household.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Nya Krokslätt, Sweden===

The site of former factory “[[Nya Krokslätt]]” is situated between a mountain and a stream. Danish engineers, Ramboll, have designed a concept of slowing down and guiding storm water in the area with methods such as vegetation combined with ponds, streams and soak-away pits as well as glazed green-blue climate zones surrounding the buildings which delay and clean roof water and [[greywater]].
The design concept provides for a multifunctional, rich urban environment, which includes not only technical solutions for energy efficient buildings, but encompasses the implementation of blue-green infrastructure and [[ecosystem services]] in an urban area.&lt;ref name="Multifunctional green areas" /&gt;

===Zürich, Switzerland===

Since 1991, the city of [[Zürich]] has had a law stating all flat roofs (unless used as terraces) must be greened roofed surfaces. The main advantages as a result of this policy include increased biodiversity, rainwater storage and outflow delay, and micro-climatic compensation (temperature extremes, radiation balance, evaporation and filtration efficiency).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/ted/de/index/gsz/angebote_u_beratung/beratung/dachbegruenungen.html|title=Dachbegrünung - Stadt Zürich|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roof biotopes are stepping stones which, together with the earthbound green areas and the seeds distributed by wind and birds, make an important contribution to the urban green infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Urban green-blue grids" /&gt;

===Duisburg-Nord, Germany===

In the old industrial area of the [[Ruhr District]] in Germany, [[Duisburg]]-Nord is a landscape park which incorporates former industrial structures and natural biodiversity. The architects Latz + Partner developed the water park which now consists of the old River Emscher, subdivided into five main sections: Klarwasserkanal (Clear Water Canal), the Emschergraben (Dyke), the Emscherrinne (Channel), the Emscherschlucht (Gorge) and the Emscherbach (Stream). The open waste water canal of the “Old Emscher” river is now fed gradually by rainwater collection through a series of barrages and water shoots. This gradual supply means that, even in lengthy dry spells, water can be supplied to the Old Emscher to replenish the oxygen levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.landschaftspark.de/architecture-nature/water-concept accessed: 12.04.13&lt;/ref&gt; This has allowed the canalised river bed to become a valley with possibilities for nature development and recreation.
As a key part of the ecological objectives, much of the overgrown areas of the property were included in the plan as they were found to contain a wide diversity of flora and fauna, including threatened species from the red list. Another important theme in the development of the plan was to make the water system visible, in order to stimulate a relationship between visitors and the water.&lt;ref name="Urban green-blue grids" /&gt;

===New York Sun Works Center, US===

The Greenhouse Project was started in 2008 by a small group of public school parents and educators to facilitate hands-on learning, not only to teach about food and nutrition, but also to help children make educated choices regarding their impact on the environment.
The laboratory is typically built as a traditional greenhouse on school rooftops and accommodates a hydroponic urban farm and environmental science laboratory. It includes solar panels, hydroponic growing systems, a rainwater catchment system, a weather station and a vermi composting station.
Main topics of education include nutrition, water resource management, efficient land use, climate change, biodiversity, conservation, contamination, pollution, waste management, and sustainable development. Students learn the relationship between humans and the environment and gain a greater appreciation of sustainable development and its direct relationship to cultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nysunworks.org/thegreenhouseproject |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618005619/http://nysunworks.org/thegreenhouseproject |archivedate=2013-06-18 |df= }} accessed: 12.04.13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hammarby Sjöstad, Stockholm, Sweden===

In the early 1990s, [[Hammarby Sjöstad]] had a reputation for being a run-down, polluted and unsafe industrial and residential area.&lt;ref name="Urban green-blue grids" /&gt; Now, it is a new district in Stockholm where the City has imposed tough environmental requirements on buildings, technical installations and the traffic environment.
An ‘eco-cycle’ solution named the Hammarby Model, developed by Fortum, Stockholm Water Company and the Stockholm Waste Management Administration, is an integral energy, waste and water system for both housing and offices. The goal is to create a residential environment based on sustainable resource usage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hammarbysjostad.se/ accessed: 15.04.13&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include waste heat from the treated wastewater being used for heating up the water in the district heating system, rainwater runoff is returned to the natural cycle through infiltration in [[green roof]]s and treatment pools, sludge from the local wastewater treatment is recycled as fertiliser for farming and forestry.&lt;ref name="Urban green-blue grids" /&gt;
This sustainable model has been a source of inspiration to many urban development projects including the Toronto (Canada) Waterfront, London's New Wembley, and a number of cities/city areas in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleanenergyawards.com/no_cache/top-navigation/nominees-projects/nominee-detail/singleprintview/project/66/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618224758/http://www.cleanenergyawards.com/no_cache/top-navigation/nominees-projects/nominee-detail/singleprintview/project/66/ |archivedate=2012-06-18 |df= }} accessed: 15.04.13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emeryville, California, US===
EPA supported the city of [[Emeryville, California]] in the development of "Stormwater Guidelines for Green, Dense Redevelopment."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/emeryville.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Emeryville, which is a suburb of [[San Francisco]], began in the 1990s reclaiming, remediating and redeveloping the many brownfields within its borders. These efforts sparked a successful economic rebound. The city did not stop there, and decided in the 2000s to harness the redevelopment progress for even better environmental outcomes, in particular that related to stormwater runoff, by requiring in 2005 the use of on-site GI practices in all new private development projects. The city faced several challenges, including a high water table, tidal flows, clay soils, contaminated soil and water, and few absorbent natural areas among the primarily impervious, paved parcels of existing and redeveloped industrial sites. The guidelines, and an accompanying spreadsheet model, were developed to make as much use of redevelopment sites as possible for handling stormwater. The main strategies fell into several categories:
* Reducing the need, space and stormwater impact of motor vehicle parking by way of increased densities, height limits and floor area ratios; shared, stacked, indoor and unbundled automobile parking; making the best use of on-street parking and pricing strategies; car-sharing; free citywide mass transit; requiring one secure indoor bicycle parking space per bedroom and better bicycle and pedestrian roadway infrastructure.
* Sustainable landscape design features, such as tree preservation and minimum rootable soil volumes for new tree planting, use of structural soils, suspended paving systems, bioretention and biofiltration strategies and requiring the use of the holistic practices of Bay-Friendly Landscaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bayfriendlycoalition.org|title=ReScape - Rethinking California Landscapes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Water storage and harvesting through cisterns and rooftop containers.
* Other strategies to handle or infiltrate water on development and redevelopment sites.

===Gowanus Canal Sponge Park, New York, US===
The [[Gowanus Canal]], in [[Brooklyn, New York]], is bounded by several communities including Park Slope, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, and Red Hook. The canal empties into [[New York Harbor]]. Completed in 1869, the canal was once a major transportation route for the then separate cities of Brooklyn and New York City. Manufactured gas plants, mills, tanneries, and chemical plants are among the many facilities that operated along the canal. As a result of years of discharges, storm water runoff, sewer outflows, and industrial pollutants, the canal has become one of the nation's most extensively contaminated water bodies. Contaminants include PCBs, coal tar wastes, heavy metals, and volatile organics. On March 2, 2010, EPA added the canal to the its Superfund [[National Priorities List]] (NPL). Placing the canal on the list allows the agency to further investigate contamination at the site and develop an approach to address the contamination.

After the NPL designation, several firms tried to redesign the area surrounding the canal to meet EPA's principles. One of the proposals was the Gowanus Canal Sponge Park, suggested by DLANDstudio, an architecture and landscape architecture firm based in Brooklyn. The firm designed a public open space system that slows, absorbs, and filters surface water runoff with the goal of remediating contaminated water, activating the private canal waterfront, and revitalizing the neighborhood. The unique feature of the park is its character as a working landscape that means the ability to improve the environment of the canal over time while simultaneously supporting public engagement with the canal ecosystem. The park was cited in a professional award by the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], in the Analysis and Planning category, in 2010.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Lafitte Greenway, New Orleans, Louisiana, US ===
The [[Lafitte Greenway]] in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]], is a post-[[Hurricane Katrina]] revitalization effort that utilizes green infrastructure to improve water quality as well as support wildlife habitat.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/2013awards/328.html|title=2013 ASLA Professional Awards|last=|first=|date=|website=ASLA.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was previously an industrial corridor that connected the [[French Quarter]] to [[Bayou St. John, New Orleans|Bayou St. John]] and [[Lake Pontchartrain]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Part of the revitalization plan was to incorporate green infrastructure for environmental sustainability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One strategy to mitigate localized flooding was to create recreation fields that are carved out to hold water during times of heavy rains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Another strategy was to restore the native ecology of the corridor, giving special attention to the ecotones that bisect the site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The design proposed retrofitting historic buildings with stormwater management techniques, such as rainwater collection systems, which allows historic buildings to be preserved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This project received the Award of Excellence from the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Geographic Information System applications==
A [[Geographic Information System]] (GIS) is a computer system for that allows users to capture, store, display, and analyze all kinds of spatial data on Earth.&lt;ref name="education.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=GIS (geographic information system)|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/?ar_a=1|website=National Geographic|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIS can gather multiple layers of information on one single map regarding streets, buildings, soil types, vegetation, and more.&lt;ref name="education.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt; Planners can combine or calculate useful information such as impervious area percentage or vegetation coverage status of a specific region to design or analyze the use of green infrastructure. The continued development of [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) and their increasing level of use is particularly important in the development of Green Infrastructure plans. The plans frequently are based on GIS analysis of many layers of geographic information.&lt;ref name="education.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;

===Green Infrastructure Master Plan===
According to the Green Infrastructure Master Plan, developed by Hawkins Partners, civil engineers use GIS to analyze the modeling of impervious surfaces with historical Nashville rainfall data within the CSS (combined sewer system) to find the current rates of runoff.
GIS  are able to help planning teams analyze potential volume reductions at the specific region for green infrastructures, including water harvesting, green roofs, urban trees, and structural control measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASLA 2013 Professional Awards, Green Infrastructure Master Plan|url=http://www.asla.org/2013awards/410.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

===Barriers===
Lack of funding is consistently cited as a barrier to the implementation of green infrastructure.  One advantage that green infrastructure projects offer, however, is that they generate so many benefits that they can compete for a variety of diverse funding sources. Some tax incentive programs administered by federal agencies can be used to attract financing to green infrastructure projects. Here are two examples of programs whose missions are broad enough to support green infrastructure projects:

* The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] administers a range of energy efficiency tax incentives, and green infrastructure could be integrated into project design to claim the incentive. An example of how this might work is found in Oregon’s Energy Efficiency Construction Credits. In Eugene, Oregon, a new biofuel station built on an abandoned gas station site included a green roof, bioswales and rain gardens. In this case, nearly $250,000 worth of tax credits reduced income and sales tax for the private company that built and operated the project.
* The [[U.S. Department of Treasury]] administers the multibillion-dollar New Markets Tax Credit program, which encourages private investment for a range of project types (typically real estate or business development projects) in distressed areas. Awards are allocated to non-profit and private entities based on their proposals for distributing these tax benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/funding-opportunities |title=Funding Opportunities |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-11-02 |website=Green Infrastructure |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
[[File:Emeryville California Stormwater Curb Extension.jpg|thumbnail|right|This Stormwater Curb Extension in Emeryville, California provides a pedestrian safety element as well as stormwater quality benefits. It uses Bay-Friendly Landscaping and recycled water for irrigation.]]
Some people might expect that green spaces are excessive to maintain and extravagant in nature, but high-performing green spaces can provide real economic, ecological and social benefits. For example:
* Urban forestry in an urban environment can supplement managing storm water and reduce the energy usage costs and runoff in result. 
* Bio-retention systems can work to create a green transportation system.
* Stormwater Curb Extensions can increase pedestrian safety by increasing visibility and reducing crossing distances at intersections.
In result, high performing green spaces work to create a balance between built and natural environments.

===Economic effects===
A study in 2012 that focused on 479 green infrastructure projects across the United States, found that 44% of green infrastructure projects reduce costs compared to the 31% that increased the costs.  The most notable cost savings were due to reduced stormwater runoff and decreased heating and cooling costs.

A comprehensive green infrastructure in Philadelphia is planned to cost just $1.2 billion over the next 25 years, compared to over $6 billion for "grey" infrastructure (concrete tunnels created to move water). Under the new green infrastructure plan it is expected that:
*250 people will be employed annually in green jobs.  
*Up to 1.5 billion pounds of carbon dioxide emission to be avoided or absorbed through green infrastructure each year (the equivalent of removing close to 3,400 vehicles from roadways) 
*Air quality will improve due to all the new trees, green roofs, and parks
*Communities will benefit on the social and health side 
*About 20 deaths due to asthma will be avoided
*250 fewer work or school days will be missed
*Deaths due to excessive urban heat could also be cut by 250 over 20 years.
*The new greenery will increase property values by $390 million over 45 years, also boosting the property taxes the city takes in.

A green infrastructure plan in New York City is expected to cost $1.5 billion less than a comparable grey infrastructure approach. Also, the green stormwater management systems alone will save $1 billion, at a cost of about $0.15 less per gallon. The sustainability benefits in New York City range from $139–418 million over the 20 year life of the project. This green plan estimates that “every fully vegetated acre of green infrastructure would provide total annual benefits of $8.522 in reduced energy demand, $166 in reduced CO2 emissions, $1,044 in improved air quality, and $4,725 in increased property value.”&lt;ref name="citylab.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA-econ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asla.org/ContentDetail.aspx?id=43535 |title=Green Infrastructure: Cities |publisher=American Society of Landscape Architects}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/green-infrastructure-cost-benefit-resources |title=Green Infrastructure Cost-Benefit Resources |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-08-12 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ongoing Initiatives===
One program that has integrated green infrastructure into construction projects worldwide is the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) certification.  This system offers a benchmark rating for [[green buildings]] and neighborhoods, credibly quantifying a project’s environmental responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://new.usgbc.org/leed |title=LEED Certification |publisher=U.S. Green Building Council |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LEED program incentivizes development that uses resources efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usgbc.org/credits/new-construction/v4/material-%26-resources |title=LEED Credits: Material &amp; resources  |publisher=U.S. Green Building Council |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, it offers specific credits for reducing indoor and outdoor water use, optimizing energy performance, producing renewable energy, and minimizing or recycling project waste.  Two LEED initiatives that directly promote the use of green infrastructure include the rainwater management and heat island reduction credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usgbc.org/credits/new-construction/v4/sustainable-sites |title=LEED Credits: Sustainable sites |publisher=U.S. Green Building Council |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a successfully LEED-certified neighborhood development is the 9th and Berks Street [[transit-oriented development]] (TOD) in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, PA]] which achieved a [[LEED Platinum|Platinum]] level rating on October 12, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usgbc.org/projects/9th-and-berks-street-tod-2?view=overview |title=9th and Berks Street TOD |publisher=U.S. Green Building Council |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to implementing green infrastructure has been developed by the [https://living-future.org/ International Living Future Institute].  Their [https://living-future.org/lcc/ Living Community Challenge] assesses a community or city in twenty different aspects of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://living-future.org/product/living-community-challenge-1-2-standard/|title=Living Community Challenge 1.2 Standard|last=|first=|date=|work=The Living Future Institute|access-date=29 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably, the Challenge considers whether the development achieves net positive water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://living-future.org/lcc/water-petal/ |title=Living Community Challenge: Water Petal Intent |publisher=International Living Future Institute |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and energy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://living-future.org/lcc/energy-petal/ |title=Living Community Challenge: Energy Petal Intent |publisher=International Living Future Institute |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses and utilizes replenishable materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://living-future.org/lcc/materials-petal/ |title=Living Community Challenge: Materials Petal Intent |publisher=International Living Future Institute |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1969">'''Guillaume Grandidier''' (1 July 1873 – 13 September 1957) was a French [[geographer]], [[ethnologist]], [[zoologist]] who studied the island of [[Madagascar]].

He was the son of the wealthy industrialist [[Alfred Grandidier]] also a zoologist and expert on Madagascar. Guillaume Grandidier was Secretary of the [[Société de Géographie|Geographical Society of Paris]] and a prolific author.

The ''Atlas des Colonies Françaises, Protectorats et Territoires sous Mandat de la France'', simply known as the Atlas Grandidier, was published under his direction in 1934. Among his other works was the monumental ''Madagascar L'Histoire politique, physique et naturelle de Madagascar''. This work was undertaken in cooperation with his father and others such as [[Alphonse Milne-Edwards]] and [[Leon Vaillant]]. This work ran to 40 volumes.

''[[Liopholidophis|Liopholidophis grandidieri]]'', a [[species]] of snake [[Endemism|endemic]] to Madagascar, was named in his honor by French [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] [[François Mocquard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[François Mocquard|Mocquard F]]. 1904. "''Description de quelques reptiles et d'un batracien nouveaux de la collection du Muséum'' ". ''Bulletin du Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle'' '''10''' (26): 301-309. (''Liopholidophis grandidieri'', new species, pp. 304-305). (in [[French language|French]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:NI''' is the entry for [[Nicaragua]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Nicaragua, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[departments of Nicaragua|15 departments and 2 autonomous regions]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|NI}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Nicaragua. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''[[Jordan]] Transverse Mercator (JTM)''' ([[Arabic]]: نظام تربيع ميركاتور الأردني المستعرض) is a grid system created by the [[Royal Jordan Geographic Center]] (RJGC). This system is based on 6° belts with a Central Meridian of 37° East and a Scale Factor at Origin (mo) =&amp;nbsp;0.9998. The JTM is based on the [[Hayford ellipsoid]] adopted by the [[IUGG]] in 1924. No transformation parameters are presently offered by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Grids &amp; Datums—Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Article by Clifford J.

At its greatest extent, in the mid-11th century, it stretched from the [[Baltic Sea]] in the north to the [[Black Sea]] in the south and from the [[River source|headwaters]] of the [[Vistula]] in the west to the [[Taman Peninsula]] in the east,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\K\Y\KyivanRushDA.htm Kyivan Rus’], Encyclopedia of Ukraine, vol. 2 (1988), Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [http://izbornyk.org.ua/litop/map_980_1054.htm Historical map of Kievan Rus' from 980 to 1054].&lt;/ref&gt; uniting the majority of East Slavic tribes.&lt;ref name=channon /&gt;

According to [[Russian historiography]], the first ruler to start uniting East Slavic lands into what has become known as Kievan Rus' was [[Oleg of Novgorod|Prince Oleg]] (882–912). He extended his control from [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]] south along the [[Dnieper]] river valley to protect trade from [[Khazars|Khazar]] incursions from the east,&lt;ref name=channon /&gt; and he moved his capital to the more strategic [[Kiev]]. [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I]] (died 972) achieved the first major expansion of Kievan Rus' territorial control, fighting a war of conquest against the Khazars. [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015) [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|introduced Christianity]] with his own baptism and, by decree, extended it to all inhabitants of Kiev and beyond. Kievan Rus' reached its greatest extent under [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–1054); his sons assembled and issued its first written legal code, the [[Russkaya Pravda|Rus' Justice]], shortly after his death.&lt;ref name=concise&gt;Bushkovitch, Paul.

The state declined beginning in the late 11th century and during the 12th century, disintegrating into various rival regional powers.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Robert Magocsi, Historical Atlas of East Central Europe (1993), p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; It was further weakened by economic factors, such as the collapse of Rus' commercial ties to the [[Byzantine Empire]] due to the decline of [[Constantinople]]&lt;ref name="occawlonline.pearsoned.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://occawlonline.pearsoned.com/bookbind/pubbooks/stearns_awl/chapter15/objectives/deluxe-content.html|title=Civilization in Eastern Europe Byzantium and Orthodox Europe|publisher=occawlonline.pearsoned.com|date=2000|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122074001/http://occawlonline.pearsoned.com/bookbind/pubbooks/stearns_awl/chapter15/objectives/deluxe-content.html|archivedate=22 January 2010|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the accompanying diminution of [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks|trade routes]] through its territory.

P.|title=Khimera "Kievskoy Rusi"|journal=Rodina|year=1999|issue=8|pages=29–33|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the term was introduced in the early 20th century, when it was found in the 1913 English translation of [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]]'s ''A History of Russia'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Vasily Klyuchevsky]], ''[https://archive.org/stream/historyofrussia03kliu#page/n5/mode/2up A History of Russia]'', vol. 3, pp. 98, 104&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish the early polity from successor states, which were also named ''Rus''. Later, the Russian term was rendered into [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] as {{lang|be|Кіеўская Русь}} ({{transl|be|Kijeŭskaja Rus’}}) and {{lang|uk|Ки́ївська Русь}} ({{transl|uk|Kyivs'ka Rus’}}), respectively.

==History==
===Origin===
{{See also|Rus' Khaganate}}

Prior to the emergence of Kievan Rus' in the 9th century AD, the lands between the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]] were primarily populated by [[East Slavs|eastern Slavic]] tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Martin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sRCc3TtL9bIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=russian%20medieval%20history&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=russian%20medieval%20history&amp;f=false Medieval Russia, 980–1584] (Cambridge, 2003), pp.2-4.&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern region around [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]] were the [[Ilmen Slavs]]&lt;ref&gt;Carl Waldman &amp; Catherine Mason, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kfv6HKXErqAC&amp;lpg=PA415&amp;ots=_x1CJ9x41C&amp;dq=Ilmen%20Slavs&amp;pg=PA415#v=onepage&amp;q=Ilmen%20Slavs&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of European Peoples (2006)], p.415.&lt;/ref&gt; and neighboring [[Krivichs|Krivichi]], who occupied territories surrounding the headwaters of the [[Daugava River|West Dvina]], [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]], and [[Volga River]]s. To their north, in the [[Staraya Ladoga|Ladoga]] and [[Karelia]] regions, were the Finnic [[Chud]] tribe. In the south, in the area around Kiev, were the [[Polans (eastern)|Poliane]], a group of [[Slavicisation|Slavicized]] tribes with [[Iranian people|Iranian]] origins,&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=sRCc3TtL9bIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=russian%20medieval%20history&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=russian%20medieval%20history&amp;f=false p.4].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Drevlyans|Drevliane]] to the west of the Dnieper, and the [[Severians|Severiane]] to the east. To their north and east were the [[Vyatichi]], and to their south was forested land settled by Slav farmers, giving way to steppelands populated by nomadic herdsmen.

[[File:Muromian-map.png|thumb|Approximate ethno-linguistic map of Kievan Rus' in the 9th century: Five [[Volga Finns|Volga Finnic]] groups of the Merya, [[Mari people|Mari]], Muromians, Meshchera and [[Mordvins]] are shown as surrounded by the [[Slavs]] to the west; the three Finnic groups of the [[Vepsians|Veps]], [[Estonians|Ests]] and [[Chud]]s, and Indo-European [[Balts]] to the northwest; the [[Permians]] to the northeast the ([[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]) [[Bulghars]] and [[Khazars]] to the southeast and south.]]

Controversy persists over whether the [[Rus' people|Rus']] were [[Varangians]] (Vikings) or Slavs. This uncertainty is due largely to a paucity of contemporary sources. Attempts to address this question instead rely on archaeological evidence, the accounts of foreign observers, and legends and literature from centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Martin, ''From Kiev to Muscovy: The Beginnings to 1450'', ''in'' Russia: A History (Oxford Press, 1997, edited by Gregory Freeze), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; To some extent the controversy is related to the [[Myth of origins|foundation myths]] of modern states in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BNUtdVrw6lIC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Magocsi (2010)], p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the "[[Rus' people|Normanist]]" view, the Rus' were Scandinavians, while Russian and Ukrainian nationalist historians generally argue that the Rus' were themselves Slavs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BNUtdVrw6lIC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Magocsi (2010)], p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas V. Riasanovsky, A History of Russia, pp. 23-28 (Oxford Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\N\O\Normanisttheory.htm Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine] Normanist theory&lt;/ref&gt; Normanist theories focus on the earliest written source for the [[East Slavs]], the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513866/The-Russian-Primary-Chronicle The Russian Primary Chronicle], Encyclopædia Britannica Online; [https://www.utoronto.ca/elul/English/218/PVL-selections.pdf Russian Primary Chronicle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530225833/http://www.utoronto.ca/elul/English/218/PVL-selections.pdf |date=2014-05-30 }}, Selected Text, University of Toronto (retrieved June 4, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; although even this account was not produced until the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Riasanovsky, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalist accounts have suggested that the Rus' were present before the arrival of the Varangians,&lt;ref&gt;Riasanovsky, pp. 25-27.&lt;/ref&gt; noting that only a handful of Scandinavian words can be found in [[Russian language|modern Russian]] and that Scandinavian names in the early chronicles were soon replaced by Slavic names.&lt;ref name=stone&gt;David R. Stone, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ok7iVsgiNmAC&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the war in Chechnya''] (2006), pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, archaeological evidence from the area suggests that a Scandinavian population was present during the 10th century at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Franklin and Jonathan Shepherd, The Emergence of Rus 750–1200 (Harlow, Essex: 1996), pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; On balance, it seems likely that the Rus' proper were a small minority of Scandinavians who formed an elite ruling class, while the great majority of their subjects were Slavs.&lt;ref name=stone/&gt; Considering the linguistic arguments mounted by nationalist scholars, if the proto-Rus' were Scandinavians, they must have quickly become [[nativization|nativized]], adopting Slavic languages and other cultural practices.

[[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]], an Arab traveler during the 10th century, provided one of the earliest written descriptions of the Rus': "They are as tall as a [[date palm]], blond and ruddy, so that they do not need to wear a tunic nor a cloak; rather the men among them wear garments that only cover half of his body and leaves one of his hands free."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fadlan|first=Ibn|title=(Richard Frey) Ibn Fadlan's Journey to Russia|year=2005|publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liutprand of Cremona]], who was twice an envoy to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] court (949 and 968), identifies the "Russi" with the [[Norsemen|Norse]] ("the Russi, whom we call Norsemen by another name")&lt;ref&gt;''Rusios, quos alio nos nomine Nordmannos apellamus''. {{pl icon}} Henryk Paszkiewicz (2000). ''Wzrost potęgi Moskwy'', s.13, Kraków. {{ISBN|83-86956-93-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but explains the name as a Greek term referring to their physical traits ("A certain people made up of a part of the Norse, whom the Greeks call ''[...]'' the Russi on account of their physical features, we designate as Norsemen because of the location of their origin.").&lt;ref&gt;''Gens quaedam est sub aquilonis parte constituta, quam a qualitate corporis Graeci vocant [...] Rusios, nos vero a positione loci nominamus Nordmannos''. James Lea Cate. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ya9g9pmju8gC&amp;pg=RA1-PA482 ''Medieval and Historiographical Essays in Honor of James Westfall Thompson''. p.482.] The University of Chicago Press, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo the Deacon]], a 10th-century Byzantine historian and chronicler, refers to the Rus' as "[[Scythians]]" and notes that they tended to adopt Greek rituals and customs.&lt;ref&gt;Leo the Deacon, The History of Leo the Deacon: Byzantine Military Expansion in the Tenth Century (Alice-Mary Talbot &amp; Denis Sullivan, eds., 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=RCDsV41k8A0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 193-94].&lt;/ref&gt; But 'Scythians' in Greek parlance is used predominantly as a generic term for [[nomad]]s.

===Invitation of the Varangians===
[[File:Варяги.jpg|thumb|''The Invitation of the [[Varangians]]'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]: [[Rurik]] and his brothers [[Sineus and Truvor]] arrive at the lands of the [[Ilmen Slavs]].]]

According to the ''Primary Chronicle'', the territories of the East Slavs in the 9th century were divided between the Varangians and the Khazars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BNUtdVrw6lIC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Magocsi (2010)], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The Varangians are first mentioned imposing tribute from Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.utoronto.ca/elul/English/218/PVL-selections.pdf ''Primary Chronicle''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530225833/http://www.utoronto.ca/elul/English/218/PVL-selections.pdf |date=2014-05-30 }}, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 862, the Finnic and Slavic tribes in the area of [[Novgorod]] rebelled against the Varangians, driving them "back beyond the sea and, refusing them further tribute, set out to govern themselves." The tribes had no laws, however, and soon began to make war with one another, prompting them to invite the Varangians back to rule them and bring peace to the region:

{{quote|They said to themselves, "Let us seek a prince who may rule over us, and judge us according to the Law." They accordingly went overseas to the Varangian Rus'. … The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichs and the Ves then said to the Rus', "Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us". They thus selected three brothers with their kinfolk, who took with them all the Rus' and migrated.|The ''Primary Chronicle''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.utoronto.ca/elul/English/218/PVL-selections.pdf Primary Chronicle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530225833/http://www.utoronto.ca/elul/English/218/PVL-selections.pdf |date=2014-05-30 }}, pp.6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The three brothers—[[Rurik]], [[Sineus and Truvor|Sineus, and Truvor]]—established themselves in Novgorod, [[Beloozero]], and [[Izborsk]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BNUtdVrw6lIC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Magocsi (2010)], pp. 55, 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the brothers died, and Rurik became the sole ruler of the territory and progenitor of the [[Rurik Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas McCray, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=edfEV-KIt18C&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Russia and the Former Soviet Republics]'' (2006), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; A short time later, two of Rurik’s men, [[Askold and Dir]], asked him for permission to go to Tsargrad ([[Constantinople]]). On their way south, they discovered "a small city on a hill," Kiev, captured it and the surrounding country from the Khazars, populated the region with more Varangians, and "established their dominion over the country of the [[Polans (eastern)|Polyanians]]."&lt;ref name=Martin2009:37&gt;Janet Martin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JyN0hlKcfTcC&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The First East Slavic State"], ''A Companion to Russian History'' (Abbott Gleason, ed., 2009), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chronicle8&gt;[https://www.utoronto.ca/elul/English/218/PVL-selections.pdf Primary Chronicle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530225833/http://www.utoronto.ca/elul/English/218/PVL-selections.pdf |date=2014-05-30 }}, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation of the Kievan state===

Rurik led the Rus' until his death in about 879, bequeathing his kingdom to his kinsman, [[Oleg of Novgorod|Prince Oleg]], as regent for his young son, [[Igor of Kiev|Igor]].&lt;ref name=Chronicle8 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1997), p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 880-82, Oleg led a military force south along the [[Dnieper river]], capturing [[Smolensk]] and [[Lyubech]] before reaching Kiev, where he deposed and killed Askold and Dir, proclaimed himself prince, and declared Kiev the "[[mother of Rus' cities]]."&lt;ref&gt;Normanist scholars accept this moment as the foundation of the Kievan Rus' state, while anti-Normanists point to other Chronicle entries to argue that the East Slav Polianes were already in the process of forming a state independently.

By 885 he had subjugated the Poliane, Severiane, Vyatichi, and [[Radimichs]], forbidding them to pay further tribute to the Khazars. Oleg continued to develop and expand a network of Rus' forts in Slav lands, begun by Rurik in the north.&lt;ref&gt;George Vernadsky, Kievan Russia (1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1HEdAP9N6ikC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.23].&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Kievan state prospered due to its abundant supply of [[fur]]s, [[beeswax]], [[honey]], and [[slaves]] for export,&lt;ref name=Moss37&gt;Walter Moss, A History of Russia: To 1917 (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BXgNSFIEJ2QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=russian%20history&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=russian%20history&amp;f=false p.37].&lt;/ref&gt; and because it controlled three main trade routes of [[Eastern Europe]]. In the north, Novgorod served as a commercial link between the Baltic Sea and the [[Volga trade route]] to the lands of the [[Volga Bulgars]], the Khazars, and across the [[Caspian Sea]] as far as [[Baghdad]], providing access to markets and products from Central Asia and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Magocsi (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNUtdVrw6lIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA96#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 96]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin2009:47&gt;Martin (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=JyN0hlKcfTcC&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 47].&lt;/ref&gt; Trade from the Baltic also moved south on a network of rivers and short portages along the Dnieper known as the "[[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks|route from the Varangians to the Greeks]]," continuing to the Black Sea and on to Constantinople. Kiev was a central outpost along the Dnieper route and a hub with the east-west overland [[trade route from the Khazars to the Germans|trade route between the Khazars and the Germanic lands]] of Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JyN0hlKcfTcC&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Martin (2009)], pp. 40,47.&lt;/ref&gt; These commercial connections enriched Rus' merchants and princes, funding military forces and the construction of churches, palaces, fortifications, and further towns.&lt;ref name=Martin2009:47 /&gt; Demand for luxury goods fostered production of expensive jewelry and religious wares, allowing their export, and an advanced credit and money-lending system may have also been in place.&lt;ref name=Moss37 /&gt;

=== Early foreign relations ===
==== Volatile steppe politics ====
The rapid expansion of the Rus' to the south led to conflict and volatile relationships with the Khazars and other neighbors on the [[Pontic steppe]].&lt;ref name=Magocsi62&gt;Magocsi (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNUtdVrw6lIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.62].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Magocsi66&gt;Magocsi (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNUtdVrw6lIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true p.66].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=sRCc3TtL9bIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=russian%20medieval%20history&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q=russian%20medieval%20history&amp;f=false pp.16-19].&lt;/ref&gt; The Khazars [[Pax Khazarica|dominated]] the Black Sea steppe during the 8th century,&lt;ref&gt;Victor Spinei, ''The Romanians and the Turkic Nomads North of the Danube Delta from the Tenth to the Mid-Thirteenth Century'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2vl538CMBsAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.47-49].&lt;/ref&gt; trading and frequently [[Khazar#Khazars and Byzantium|allying]] with the Byzantine Empire against Persians and Arabs. In the late 8th century, the collapse of the [[Göktürks|Göktürk Khaganate]] led the [[Magyars]] and the [[Pechenegs]], [[Ugric peoples|Ugric]] and [[Turkic peoples]] from Central Asia, to migrate west into the steppe region,&lt;ref&gt;Peter B. Golden, ''Central Asia in World History'' (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PtT5p-6V5FcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.63].&lt;/ref&gt; leading to military conflict, disruption of trade, and instability within the Khazar Khaganate.&lt;ref&gt;Magocsi (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNUtdVrw6lIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.62-63].&lt;/ref&gt; The Rus' and Slavs had earlier allied with the Khazars against Arab raids on the Caucasus, but they increasingly worked against them to secure control of the trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;Vernadsky (1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1HEdAP9N6ikC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.20].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Byzantine Empire was able to take advantage of the turmoil to expand its political influence and commercial relationships, first with the Khazars and later with the Rus' and other steppe groups.&lt;ref name=Magocsi62 /&gt; The Byzantines established the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|Theme]] of [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]], formally known as Klimata, in the Crimea in the 830s to defend against raids by the Rus' and to protect vital grain shipments supplying Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Majeska (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=JyN0hlKcfTcC&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.51]&lt;/ref&gt; Cherson also served as a key diplomatic link with the Khazars and others on the steppe, and it became the centre of Black Sea commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Angeliki Papageorgiou, [http://blacksea.ehw.gr/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaID=11973 "Theme of Cherson (Klimata)"], ''Encyclopaedia of the Hellenic World'' (Foundation of the Hellenic World, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantines also helped the Khazars build a fortress at [[Sarkel]] on the Don river to protect their northwest frontier against incursions by the Turkic migrants and the Rus', and to control caravan trade routes and the portage between the Don and Volga rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Alan Brook, The Jews of Khazaria (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hEuIveNl9kcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.31–32]&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of the Rus' put further military and economic pressure on the Khazars, depriving them of territory, tributaries, and trade.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=sRCc3TtL9bIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=russian%20medieval%20history&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q=russian%20medieval%20history&amp;f=false pp.15–16].&lt;/ref&gt; In around 890, Oleg waged an indecisive war in the lands of the lower [[Dniester river|Dniester]] and Dnieper rivers with the [[Tivertsi]] and the [[Ulichs]], who were likely acting as vassals of the Magyars, blocking Rus' access to the Black Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Vernadsky (1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1HEdAP9N6ikC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanei (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2vl538CMBsAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.62].&lt;/ref&gt; In 894, the Magyars and Pechenegs were drawn into [[Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars#Simeon I's Imperial ambitions|the wars]] between the Byzantines and the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]]. The Byzantines arranged for the Magyars to attack Bulgarian territory from the north, and Bulgaria in turn persuaded the Pechenegs to attack the Magyars from their rear. Boxed in, the Magyars were forced to migrate further west across the [[Carpathian Mountains]] into the Hungarian plain, depriving the Khazars of an important ally and a buffer from the Rus'.&lt;ref&gt;John V.A. Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century'' (1991), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0NBxG9Id58C&amp;pg=PA137&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.138-39].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanei (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2vl538CMBsAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.66, 70].&lt;/ref&gt; The migration of the Magyars allowed Rus' access to the Black Sea,&lt;ref&gt;Vernadsky (1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1HEdAP9N6ikC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=Oleg&amp;f=false p.28].&lt;/ref&gt; and they soon launched excursions into Khazar territory along the sea coast, up the Don river, and into the lower Volga region. The Rus' were [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus'|raiding and plundering]] into the Caspian Sea region from 864,&lt;ref&gt;Abaskun, first recorded by [[Ptolemy]] as ''Socanaa'', was documented in Arab sources as "the most famous port of the Khazarian Sea". It was situated within three days' journey from [[Gorgan]]. The southern part of the Caspian Sea was known as the "Sea of Abaskun". See: B.N. Zakhoder (1898–1960). ''The Caspian Compilation of Records about Eastern Europe'' ([http://gumilevica.kulichki.net/Rest/index.html online version]).&lt;/ref&gt; with the first large-scale expedition in 913, when they extensively raided Baku, Gilan, Mazandaran and penetrated into the Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;The Khazar khagan initially granted the Rus' safe passage in exchange for a share of the booty but attacked them on their return voyage, killing most of the raiders and seizing their haul.

As the 10th century progressed, the Khazars were no longer able to command tribute from the Volga Bulgars, and their relationship with the Byzantines deteriorated, as Byzantium increasingly allied with the Pechenegs against them.&lt;ref&gt;Moss (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BXgNSFIEJ2QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=russian%20history&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q=Pechenegs&amp;f=false p.29].&lt;/ref&gt; The Pechenegs were thus secure to raid the lands of the Khazars from their base between the Volga and [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] rivers, allowing them to expand to the west.&lt;ref name=Magocsi66 /&gt; Rus' relations with the Pechenegs were complex, as the groups alternately formed alliances with and against one another. The Pechenegs were nomads roaming the steppe raising livestock which they traded with the Rus' for agricultural goods and other products.&lt;ref name=Martin2003:17&gt;Martin (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=sRCc3TtL9bIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=russian%20medieval%20history&amp;pg=PA17&amp;f=false p.17].&lt;/ref&gt; The lucrative Rus' trade with the Byzantine Empire had to pass through Pecheneg-controlled territory, so the need for generally peaceful relations was essential. Nevertheless, while the Primary Chronicle reports the Pechenegs entering Rus' territory in 915 and then making peace, they were waging war with one another again in 920.&lt;ref name=Magocsi67&gt;Magocsi (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNUtdVrw6lIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true p.67].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Russian Primary Chronicle'', Laurentian Text (Samuel Hazzard Cross, trans., 1930), [http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/dokumente/a/a011458.pdf p.71]&lt;/ref&gt; Pechenegs are reported assisting the Rus' in later campaigns against the Byzantines, yet allied with the Byzantines against the Rus' at other times.&lt;ref&gt;Moss (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BXgNSFIEJ2QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=russian%20history&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q=Pechenegs&amp;f=false pp.29–30].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rus'–Byzantine relations====
[[File:10 1 List of Radzivill Chron.jpg|thumb|{{center|Rus' under the walls of Constantinople (860)}}]]

After the Rus' attack on Constantinople in 860, the Byzantine Patriarch Photius sent missionaries north to convert the Rus' and the Slavs. Prince [[Rastislav of Moravia]] had requested the Emperor to provide teachers to interpret the holy scriptures, so in 863 the brothers [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Cyril and Methodius]] were sent as missionaries, due to their knowledge of the Slavonic language.&lt;ref name=Obolensky245 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saints Cyril and Methodius, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1345803/Saints-Cyril-and-Methodius] ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Primary Chronicle, [http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/dokumente/a/a011458.pdf pp.62-63]&lt;/ref&gt; The Slavs had no written language, so the brothers devised the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], later developed into [[Cyrillic]], and standardized the language of the Slavs, later known as [[Old Church Slavonic]]. They translated portions of the Bible and drafted the first Slavic civil code and other documents, and the language and texts spread throughout Slavic territories, including Kievan Rus'. The mission of Cyril and Methodius served both evangelical and diplomatic purposes, spreading Byzantine cultural influence in support of imperial foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Obolensky (1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jv6jcwjW9WUC&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=saints%20cyril%20and%20methodius&amp;pg=PA244#v=onepage&amp;q=saints%20cyril%20and%20methodius&amp;f=false pp..244-246].&lt;/ref&gt; In 867 the Patriarch announced that the Rus' had accepted a bishop, and in 874 he speaks of an "Archbishop of the Rus'."&lt;ref name=Majeska52 /&gt;

Relations between the Rus' and Byzantines became more complex after Oleg took control over Kiev, reflecting commercial, cultural, and military concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Magocsi (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNUtdVrw6lIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true pp.66-67]&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth and income of the Rus' depended heavily upon trade with Byzantium. [[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] described the annual course of the princes of Kiev, collecting tribute from client tribes, assembling the product into a flotilla of hundreds of boats, conducting them down the Dnieper to the Black Sea, and sailing to the estuary of the Dniester, the Danube delta, and on to Constantinople.&lt;ref name=Martin2003:17 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernadsky (1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1HEdAP9N6ikC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.28-31].&lt;/ref&gt; On their return trip they would carry silk fabrics, spices, wine, and fruit. The importance of this trade relationship led to military action when disputes arose. The Primary Chronicle reports that the Rus' [[Rus'–Byzantine War (907)|attacked Constantinople]] again in 907, probably to secure trade access. The Chronicle glorifies the military prowess and shrewdness of Oleg, an account imbued with legendary detail.&lt;ref name=Majeska52 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernadsky (1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1HEdAP9N6ikC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.22].&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine sources do not mention the attack, but a pair of treaties in [[Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (907)|907]] and [[Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (911)|911]] set forth a trade agreement with the Rus',&lt;ref name=Magocsi67 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lind, [http://www.ennenjanyt.net/4-04/lind.html Varangians in Europe's Eastern and Northern Periphery], Ennen &amp; nyt (2004:4).&lt;/ref&gt; the terms suggesting pressure on the Byzantines, who granted the Rus' quarters and supplies for their merchants and tax-free trading privileges in Constantinople.&lt;ref name=Majeska52 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Logan (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XldSYkGIeLwC&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;vq=Rus'&amp;pg=PA192#v=snippet&amp;q=Rus'&amp;f=false p.192].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chronicle provides a mythic tale of Oleg's death. A sorcerer prophesies that the death of the Grand Prince would be associated with a certain horse. Oleg has the horse sequestered, and it later dies. Oleg goes to visit the horse and stands over the carcass, gloating that he had outlived the threat, when a snake strikes him from among the bones, and he soon becomes ill and dies.&lt;ref&gt;Vernadsky, pp.22-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; The Chronicle reports that [[Igor of Kiev|Prince Igor]] succeeded Oleg in 913, and after some brief conflicts with the Drevlians and the Pechenegs, a period of peace ensued for over twenty years.

[[File:Radzivill Olga-Avenge-to-Drevlians.jpg|thumb|left|[[Olga of Kiev|Princess Olga's]] avenge to the Drevlians. Radzivill chronicle]]

In 941, Igor led another [[Rus'–Byzantine War (941)|major Rus' attack]] on Constantinople, probably over trading rights again.&lt;ref name=Majeska52 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle, pp.71-72&lt;/ref&gt; A navy of 10,000 vessels, including Pecheneg allies, landed on the [[Bithynia]]n coast and devastated the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus.&lt;ref name=Ostrogorski277&gt;Ostrogorski, p.277&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was well-timed, perhaps due to intelligence, as the Byzantine fleet was occupied with the Arabs in the Mediterranean, and the bulk of its army was stationed in the east. The Rus' burned towns, churches, and monasteries, butchering the people and amassing booty. The emperor arranged for a small group of retired ships to be outfitted with [[Greek fire]] throwers and sent them out to meet the Rus', luring them into surrounding the contingent before unleashing the Greek fire.&lt;ref name=Logan193&gt;Logan, p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liutprand of Cremona]] wrote that "the Rus', seeing the flames, jumped overboard, preferring water to fire. Some sank, weighed down by the weight of their breastplates and helmets; others caught fire." Those captured were beheaded. The ploy dispelled the Rus' fleet, but their attacks continued into the hinterland as far as [[Nicomedia]], with many atrocities reported as victims were crucified and set up for use as targets. At last a Byzantine army arrived from the Balkans to drive the Rus' back, and a naval contingent reportedly destroyed much of the Rus' fleet on its return voyage (possibly an exaggeration since the Rus' soon mounted another attack). The outcome indicates increased military might by Byzantium since 911, suggesting a shift in the balance of power.&lt;ref name=Ostrogorski277 /&gt;

Igor returned to Kiev keen for revenge. He assembled a large force of warriors from among neighboring Slavs and Pecheneg allies, and sent for reinforcements of Varangians from “beyond the sea.”&lt;ref name=Logan193 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; In 944 the Rus' force advanced again on the Greeks, by land and sea, and a Byzantine force from Cherson responded. The Emperor sent gifts and offered tribute in lieu of war, and the Rus' accepted. Envoys were sent between the Rus', the Byzantines, and the Bulgarians in 945, and a [[Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (945)|peace treaty]] was completed. The agreement again focused on trade, but this time with terms less favorable to the Rus', including stringent regulations on the conduct of Rus' merchants in Cherson and Constantinople and specific punishments for violations of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle, pp.73-78&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantines may have been motivated to enter the treaty out of concern of a prolonged alliance of the Rus', Pechenegs, and Bulgarians against them,&lt;ref&gt;Spinei, p.93.&lt;/ref&gt; though the more favorable terms further suggest a shift in power.&lt;ref name=Ostrogorski277 /&gt;

====Sviatoslav====
[[File:Svyatoslav2.jpg|thumb|''[[Madrid Skylitzes]]'', meeting between [[John I Tzimiskes|John Tzimiskes]] and Sviatoslav]]

Following the death of [[Igor, Grand Prince of Kiev|Grand Prince Igor]] in 945, his wife [[Olga of Kiev|Olga]] ruled as [[regent]] in Kiev until their son [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]] reached maturity (ca. 963).&lt;ref&gt;If Olga was indeed born in 879, as the [[Primary Chronicle]] seems to imply, she would have been about 65 at the time of Sviatoslav's birth. There are clearly some problems with chronology.&lt;/ref&gt; His decade-long reign over Rus' was marked by rapid expansion through the conquest of the Khazars of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe|Pontic steppe]] and the [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria|invasion of the Balkans]]. By the end of his short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital from Kiev to [[Pereyaslavets]] on the [[Danube]] in 969. In contrast with his mother's conversion to [[History of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800–1299)|Christianity]], Sviatoslav, like his [[druzhina]], remained a staunch [[paganism|pagan]]. Due to his abrupt death in an ambush in 972, Sviatoslav's conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a [[fratricide|fratricidal]] feud among his sons, which resulted in two of his three sons being killed.

===Reign of Vladimir and Christianisation===
{{Main|Christianization of Kievan Rus'}}
[[File:Iziasłaŭ, Rahnieda, Volodymyr. Ізяслаў, Рагнеда, Володимир.jpg|thumb|[[Rogneda of Polotsk]], [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] and [[Izyaslav of Polotsk]]]]
[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir fresco in Kiev.jpg|thumb|''Baptism of Saint Prince Vladimir'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]]]]

It is not clearly documented when the title of the Grand Duke was first introduced, but the importance of the Kiev principality was recognized after the death of Sviatoslav I in 972 and the ensuing struggle between [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir the Great]] and [[Yaropolk I of Kiev|Yaropolk I]]. The region of Kiev dominated the state of Kievan Rus' for the next two centuries. The [[Grand Prince]] (''"velikiy kniaz'"'') of Kiev controlled the lands around the city, and his formally subordinate relatives ruled the other cities and paid him tribute. The zenith of the state's power came during the reigns of Vladimir the Great (980–1015) and Prince [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] (1019–1054). Both rulers continued the steady expansion of Kievan Rus' that had begun under Oleg.

Vladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to [[Scandinavia]] in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother [[Oleg of Drelinia|Oleg]] and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative [[Earl]] [[Håkon Sigurdsson]], ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a [[Viking]] army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/631547/Vladimir-I |title=Vladimir I (grand prince of Kiev) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], a process that began in 988. The [[Primary Chronicle]] states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional [[Slavic mythology|idol-worship]] ([[paganism]]) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the [[Latin Rite]], the [[Jew]]s, and the [[Muslims]] before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his [[chosen people]] to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the [[Byzantine Rite]] was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Princess Anna]], the sister of Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980–1584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eggink VelKnVladimir.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Eggink's painting represents [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] listening to the Orthodox priests, while the papal envoy stands aside in discontent.]]

Vladimir's choice of Eastern Christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with Constantinople, which dominated the Black Sea and hence trade on Kiev's most vital commercial route, the [[Dnieper River]]. Adherence to the [[Eastern Church]] had long-range political, cultural, and religious consequences. The church had a [[liturgy]] written in [[Cyrillic]] and a corpus of translations from Greek that had been produced for the [[Slavic peoples]]. This literature facilitated the conversion to Christianity of the [[Eastern Slavs]] and introduced them to rudimentary [[Greek philosophy]], science, and [[historiography]] without the necessity of learning [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (there were some merchants who did business with Greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business Greek).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Simon|title=Greek in Kievan Rus'|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|year=1992|volume=46|pages=69–81|doi=10.2307/1291640}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, educated people in medieval [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] learned [[Latin (language)|Latin]]. Enjoying independence from the Roman authority and free from tenets of Latin learning, the East Slavs developed their own literature and fine arts, quite distinct from those of other [[Eastern Orthodox]] countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} (See [[Old East Slavic language]] and [[Architecture of Kievan Rus]] for details). Following the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] of 1054, the Rus' church maintained communion with both Rome and Constantinople for some time, but along with most of the Eastern churches it eventually split to follow the Eastern Orthodox. That being said, unlike other parts of the Greek world, Kievan Rus' did not have a strong hostility to the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Colucci|first=Michele|title=The Image of Western Christianity in the Culture of Kievan Rus'|journal=Harvard Ukrainian Studies|year=1989|volume=12/13|pages=576–586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golden age===
[[File:Golden Gate Kiev 2018 G1.jpg|thumb|[[Golden Gate, Kiev]]]]

Yaroslav, known as "the Wise", struggled for power with his brothers. A son of [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir the Great]], he was vice-regent of Novgorod at the time of his father's death in 1015. Subsequently, his eldest surviving brother, [[Svyatopolk the Accursed]], killed three of his other brothers and seized power in Kiev. Yaroslav, with the active support of the Novgorodians and the help of [[Viking]] mercenaries, defeated Svyatopolk and became the grand prince of Kiev in 1019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/652106/Yaroslav-I |title=Yaroslav I (prince of Kiev) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-05-22 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he first established his rule over Kiev in 1019, he did not have uncontested rule of all of Kievan Rus' until 1036. Like Vladimir, Yaroslav was eager to improve relations with the rest of Europe, especially the Byzantine Empire. Yaroslav's granddaughter, [[Eupraxia of Kiev|Eupraxia]] the daughter of his son [[Vsevolod I, Prince of Kiev]], was married to [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway. Yaroslav promulgated the first East Slavic law code, ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''; built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] and [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]]; patronized local clergy and [[monasticism]]; and is said to have founded a school system. Yaroslav's sons developed the great [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] ([[monastery]]), which functioned in Kievan Rus' as an ecclesiastical academy.

In the centuries that followed the state's foundation, [[Rurik Dynasty|Rurik's descendants]] shared power over Kievan Rus'. Princely succession moved from elder to younger brother and from uncle to nephew, as well as from father to son. Junior members of the dynasty usually began their official careers as rulers of a minor district, progressed to more lucrative principalities, and then competed for the coveted throne of Kiev.

===Fragmentation and decline===
The gradual disintegration of the Kievan Rus' began in the 11th century, after the death of [[Yaroslav the Wise]]. The position of the [[Grand Prince of Kiev]] was weakened by the growing influence of regional clans.

An unconventional power succession system was established ([[rota system]]) whereby power was transferred to the eldest member of the ruling dynasty rather than from father to son, i.e. in most cases to the eldest brother of the ruler, fomenting constant hatred and rivalry within the royal family.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[Familicide]] was frequently deployed to obtain power and can be traced particularly during the time of the Yaroslavichi (sons of Yaroslav), when the established system was skipped in the establishment of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] as the Grand Prince of Kiev,{{Clarify|date=September 2013}}&lt;!--Why was the established rota system 'skipped'?--&gt; in turn creating major squabbles between [[Oleg I of Chernigov|Olegovichi]] from [[Chernihiv]], Monomakhs from [[Pereyaslav]], [[Izyaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslavichi]] from [[Principality of Turov|Turov]]/[[Volhynia]], and [[Polotsk Principality|Polotsk Princes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;!--This and following paragraph need to be amalgamated as they're both dealing with same subject matter.--&gt;

[[File:Kievan Nativity.jpg|thumb|''The Nativity'', a Kievan (possibly Galician) illumination from the [[Gertrude Psalter]]]]

The most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise. The rivaling [[Principality of Polotsk]] was contesting the power of the Grand Prince by occupying Novgorod, while [[Rostislav of Tmutarakan|Rostislav Vladimirovich]] was fighting for the Black Sea port of [[Tmutarakan]] belonging to Chernihiv.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Three of Yaroslav's sons that first allied together found themselves fighting each other especially after their defeat to the Cuman forces in 1068 at the [[Battle of the Alta River]]. At the same time, an uprising took place in Kiev, bringing to power [[Vseslav of Polotsk]] who supported the traditional Slavic paganism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} The ruling Grand Prince Iziaslav fled to Poland asking for support and in couple of years returned to establish the order.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} The affairs became even more complicated by the end of the 11th century driving the state into chaos and constant warfare. On the initiative of Vladimir II Monomakh in 1097 the first [[Council of Liubech|federal council]] of Kievan Rus took place near Chernihiv in the city of [[Liubech]] with the main intention to find an understanding among the fighting sides. However, even though that did not really stop the fighting, it certainly cooled things off.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

By 1130, all descendants of [[Vseslav of Polotsk|Vseslav the Seer]] had been exiled to the [[Byzantine Empire]] by [[Mstislav the Great]]. The most fierce resistance to Monomakhs posed Olegovichi when the [[izgoi]] [[Vsevolod II of Kiev|Vsevolod II]] managed to become the Grand Prince of Kiev. [[Volodar of Peremyshl|Rostislavichi]] who have initially established in [[Halych]] lands by 1189 were defeated by the Monomakh-Piast descendant [[Roman the Great]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The decline of Constantinople&amp;nbsp;– a main trading partner of Kievan Rus'&amp;nbsp;– played a significant role in the decline of the Kievan Rus'. The [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], along which the goods were moving from the Black Sea (mainly [[Byzantine]]) through [[eastern Europe]] to the Baltic, was a cornerstone of Kiev wealth and prosperity. Kiev was the main power and initiator in this relationship, once the Byzantine Empire fell into turmoil and the supplies became erratic, profits dried out, and Kiev lost its appeal.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The last ruler to maintain a united state was Mstislav the Great. After his death in 1132, the Kievan Rus' fell into recession and a rapid decline, and Mstislav's successor [[Yaropolk II of Kiev]] instead of focusing on the external threat of the [[Cumans]] was embroiled in conflicts with the growing power of the [[Novgorod Republic]]. In 1169, as the Kievan Rus' state was full of internal conflict, Andrei Bogolyubsky of Vladimir sacked the city of Kiev. The sack of the city fundamentally changed the perception of Kiev and was evidence of the fragmentation of the Kievan Rus'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pelenski|first=Jaroslaw|title=The Sack of Kiev of 1169: Its Significance for the Succession to Kievan Rus'|journal=Harvard Ukrainian Studies|year=1987|volume=11|pages=303–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 12th century, the Kievan state became even further fragmented and had been divided into roughly twelve different principalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kollmann|first=Nancy|title=Collateral Succession in Kievan Rus|journal=Harvard Ukrainian Studies|year=1990|volume=14|pages=377–387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crusades]] brought a shift in European trade routes that accelerated the decline of Kievan Rus'. In 1204, the forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]] sacked Constantinople, making the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] trade route marginal.&lt;ref name="occawlonline.pearsoned.com"/&gt; At the same time, the [[Teutonic Knights]] (of the [[Northern Crusades]]) were conquering the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region and threatening the [[Lands of Novgorod]]. Concurrently with it, the Ruthenian Federation of Kievan Rus' started to disintegrate into smaller principalities as the Rurik dynasty grew. The local [[Orthodox Christianity]] of Kievan Rus', while struggling to establish itself in the predominantly pagan state and losing its main base in Constantinople, was on the brink of extinction. Some of the main regional centres that developed later were Novgorod, Chernigov, Halych, Kiev, Ryazan, Vladimir-upon-Klyazma, Volodimer-Volyn and Polotsk.

====Novgorod Republic====
{{Main|Republic of Novgorod}}

In the north, the [[Republic of Novgorod]] prospered because it controlled trade routes from the [[River Volga]] to the Baltic Sea. As Kievan Rus' declined, Novgorod became more independent. A local [[oligarchy]] ruled Novgorod; major government decisions were made by a town assembly, which also elected a prince as the city's military leader. In 1136, Novgorod revolted against Kiev, and became independent.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} Now an independent [[city republic]], and referred to as "Lord Novgorod the Great" it would spread its "mercantile interest" to the west and the north; to the Baltic Sea and the low-populated forest regions respectively.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} In 1169, Novgorod acquired its own [[Archbishop of Novgorod|archbishop]], named [[Ilya (Archbishop of Novgorod)|Ilya]], a sign of further increased importance and political independence. Novgorod enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy although being closely associated with the Kievan Rus.

====Northeast====
{{Main|Vladimir-Suzdal}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
[[File:Europe-1139.jpg|thumb|1139 map of the Grand Duchy of Kiev, where northeastern territories identified as the Transforrest Colonies (Zalesie) by [[Joachim Lelewel]]]]

In the northeast, Slavs from the Kievan region colonized the territory that later would become the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] by subjugating and merging with the Finnic tribes already occupying the area. The city of [[Rostov]], the oldest centre of the northeast, was supplanted first by [[Suzdal]] and then by the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], which become the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal']]. The combined [[principality]] of Vladimir-Suzdal asserted itself as a major power in Kievan Rus' in the late 12th century. In 1169, [[Prince Andrey Bogolyubskiy]] of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked the city of Kiev and took over the title of the (Великий Князь/Velikiy Knyaz/Grand Prince or Grand Duke) to claim primacy in Rus'. Prince Andrey then installed his younger brother, who ruled briefly in Kiev while Andrey continued to rule his realm from Suzdal. In 1299, in the wake of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]], the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] moved from Kiev to the city of Vladimir and Vladimir-Suzdal.

====Southwest====
{{Main|Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}

To the southwest, the principality of [[Halych]] had developed trade relations with its [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Lithuania]]n neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, [[Roman the Great|Prince Roman Mstislavych]] united the two previously separate principalities. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of [[Knyaz]] of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, [[Prince Daniel]] (r. 1238–1264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a "Rex Rusiae" ("King of Rus") from the Roman [[papacy]], apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in Constantinople granted the King of [[Poland]] a metropolitan for his Ruthenian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. [[Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow|Cyprian]], a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the Russian countries was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate "Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Rus'" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.

However, a long and unsuccessful struggle against the Mongols combined with internal opposition to the prince and foreign intervention weakened Galicia-Volhynia. With the end of the [[Mstislavich]] branch of the [[Dynasty of Rurik|Rurikids]] in the mid-14th century, Galicia-Volhynia ceased to exist; Poland conquered Halych; Lithuania took [[Volhynia]], including Kiev, conquered by [[Gediminas]] in 1321 [[Battle on the Irpen' River|ending the rule of Rurikids in the city]]. Lithuanian rulers then assumed the title over [[Ruthenia]].

===Final disintegration===
[[File:Kingdom of Galicia Volhynia Rus' Ukraine 1245 1349.jpg|thumb|Lilac borders: [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]], one of the successor states of Kievan Rus']]

The state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the [[Golden Horde]] (the so-called [[Tatar Yoke]]). In the late 15th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite Grand Dukes]] began taking over former Kievan territories and proclaimed themselves the sole legal successors of the Kievan principality according to the protocols of the medieval theory of [[translatio imperii]].

On the western periphery, Kievan Rus' was succeeded by the [[Principality of Galicia-Volhynia]]. Later, as these territories, now part of modern central [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], fell to the [[Gediminids]], the powerful, largely Ruthenized [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] drew heavily on Rus' cultural and legal traditions. Due to the fact of the economic and cultural core of Rus' being located on the territory of modern Ukraine, Ukrainian historians and scholars consider Kievan Rus' to be a founding Ukrainian state.&lt;ref name="Plokhy2006" /&gt;

On the north-eastern periphery of Kievan Rus', traditions were adapted in the [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] Principality that gradually gravitated towards Moscow. To the very north, the [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] and [[Pskov Republic|Pskov]] Feudal Republics were less autocratic than Vladimir- Suzdal- Moscow until they were absorbed by the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. Russian historians consider Kievan Rus the first period of Russian history.

==Economy==
[[File:Domestic animals of Old Rus'.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Domestic animals of Old Rus']]
During the Kievan era, trade and transport depended largely on networks of rivers and portages.&lt;ref name="Cuisenier1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=William H. McNeill|authorlink=William H. McNeill (historian)|editor=Jean Cuisenier|title=Europe as a Cultural Area|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xbjbroz9hQQC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=8 February 2016|series=World Anthropology|date=1 January 1979|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-080070-8|pages=32–33|quote=For a while, it looked as if the Scandinavian thrust toward monarchy and centralization might succeed in building two impressive and imperial structures: a Danish empire of the northern seas, and a Varangian empire of the Russian rivers, headquartered at Kiev....

==Society==
[[File:Bilibin justice.jpg|thumb|''Administering justice in Kievan Rus'', by [[Ivan Bilibin]]]]
[[File:Funeral of ruthenian noble by Siemiradzki.jpg|thumb|[[Ship burial]] of a [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] chieftain as described by the [[Arab]] traveler [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]], who visited [[Northern Europe|North]]-[[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] [[Europe]] in the 10th century.&lt;br&gt;[[Henryk Siemiradzki]] (1883)]]

Due to the expansion of trade and its geographical proximity, Kiev became the most important trade centre and chief among the communes; therefore the leader of Kiev gained political "control" over the surrounding areas. This [[princedom]] emerged from a coalition of traditional [[patriarchic]] family communes banded together in an effort to increase the applicable workforce and expand the productivity of the land. This union developed the first major cities in the Rus' and was the first notable form of self-government. As these communes became larger, the emphasis was taken off the family holdings and placed on the territory that surrounded. This shift in ideology became known as the [[verv']].

In the 11th and the 12th centuries, the princes and their retinues, which were a mixture of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Scandinavia]]n elites, dominated the society of Kievan Rus'. Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of [[Western Europe]]an feudalism. Nevertheless, urban [[merchant]]s, [[artisan]]s and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the ''[[veche]]'' (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of [[slave]]s. More important was a class of tribute-paying [[peasant]]s, who owed labour duty to the princes. The widespread personal [[serfdom]] characteristic of Western Europe did not exist in Kievan Rus'.

The change in political structure led to the inevitable development of the peasant class or [[smerd]]y. The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors that began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code, they were theoretically equal to the prince, so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers. However, in the 13th century, they slowly began to lose their rights and became less equal in the eyes of the law.

The economic development of Kievan Rus may be translated into demographic statistics. Around 1200, Kiev had a population of 50,000, Novgorod and Chernigov both had around 30,000.&lt;ref name=Martin_p61&gt;Janet Martin, ''Medieval Russia, 980–1584'', (Cambridge, 1995), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Constantinople had population of about 400,000 around 1180.&lt;ref name="popu"&gt;J. Phillips, ''The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople'' page 144&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet scholar [[Mikhail Tikhomirov]] calculated that Kievan Rus' on the eve of the Mongol invasion had around 300 urban centres.&lt;ref name="TikhomirovGorodaPop"&gt;{{cite book | last = Tikhomirov | first = Mikhail Nikolaevich | authorlink = Mikhail Tikhomirov | editor =  | others =  | title = Drevnerusskie goroda (Cities of Ancient Rus)| origyear =  | url = http://www.archeologia.ru/Library/Book/3bcf6c93aa36/Info| accessdate =  | edition =  | year = 1956 | publisher = | location = Moscow | language = Russian | pages = 36, 39, 43| chapter = The origin of Russian cities | chapterurl = http://www.archeologia.ru/Library/Book/3bcf6c93aa36/page9| quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kievan Rus' also played an important genealogical role in European politics. [[Yaroslav the Wise]], whose stepmother belonged to the [[Macedonian dynasty]], which ruled the Byzantine empire from 867 to 1056, married the only legitimate daughter of the king who Christianized Sweden. His daughters became queens of Hungary, France and Norway, his sons married the daughters of a [[King of Poland|Polish king]] and a Byzantine emperor (not to mention a niece of the Pope), while his granddaughters were a German Empress and (according to one theory) the queen of [[Scotland]]. A grandson married the only daughter of the last [[Anglo-Saxon]] king of England. Thus the [[Rurikids]] were a well-connected royal family of the time.&lt;ref&gt;"In medieval Europe, a mark of a dynasty's prestige and power was the willingness with which other leading dynasties entered into matrimonial relations with it. Measured by this standard, Yaroslav's prestige must have been great indeed... . Little wonder that Iaroslav is often dubbed by historians as 'the father-in-law of Europe.'" -({{cite book | first= Orest| last= Subtelny | title=Ukraine: A History | location= Toronto | publisher=University of Toronto Press | year=1988 | isbn=0-8020-5808-6 | page= 35 | authorlink= Orest Subtelny}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"By means of these marital ties, Kievan Rus’ became well known throughout Europe."&amp;nbsp;—[[Magocsi, Paul Robert]] (1996).

From the 9th century, the [[Pecheneg]] nomads began an uneasy relationship with Kievan Rus′. For over two centuries they launched sporadic raids into the lands of Rus′, which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars (such as the 920 war on the Pechenegs by Igor of Kiev reported in the [[Primary Chronicle]]), but there were also temporary military alliances (e.g. the 943 Byzantine campaign by Igor).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Haukal]] describes the Pechenegs as the long-standing allies of [[the Rus]], whom they invariably accompanied during the 10th century [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus|Caspian expeditions]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 968, the Pechenegs [[Siege of Kiev (968)|attacked and besieged the city of Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven |last=Lowe |first2=Dmitriy V. |last2=Ryaboy |title=The Pechenegs, History and Warfare |location= |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speculation exists that the Pechenegs drove off the [[Tivertsi]] and the [[Ulichs]] to the regions of the upper [[Dniester river]] in [[Bukovina]]. The Byzantine Empire was known to support the Pechenegs in their military campaigns against the Eastern Slavic states.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[Boniak]] was a [[Cuman]] [[Khan (title)|khan]] who led a series of invasions on Kievan Rus′. In 1096, Boniak attacked Kiev, plundered the [[Kiev Monastery of the Caves]], and burned down the prince's palace in [[Berestovo]]. He was defeated in 1107 by [[Vladimir Monomakh]], Oleg, Sviatopolk and other Rus′ princes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|script-title=ru:Боняк|trans-title=Boniak|language=ru|encyclopedia=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]|url=http://slovari.yandex.ru/%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%8F%D0%BA/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%8F%D0%BA/|year=1969–1978|accessdate=10 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130706115500/http://slovari.yandex.ru/%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%8F%D0%BA/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%8F%D0%BA/|archivedate=6 July 2013|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mongol Empire]] invaded Kievan Rus' in the 13th century, destroying numerous cities, including [[Ryazan]], [[Kolomna]], [[Moscow]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] and Kiev. [[Giovanni de Plano Carpini]], the Pope's envoy to the Mongol Great Khan, traveled through Kiev in February 1246 and wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"They [the Mongols] attacked Rus, where they made great havoc, destroying cities and fortresses and slaughtering men; and they laid siege to Kiev, the capital of Rus; after they had besieged the city for a long time, they took it and put the inhabitants to death. When we were journeying through that land we came across countless skulls and bones of dead men lying about on the ground. Kiev had been a very large and thickly populated town, but now it has been reduced almost to nothing, for there are at the present time scarce two hundred houses there and the inhabitants are kept in complete slavery"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html |title=The Destruction of Kiev |publisher=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca |accessdate=2013-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120530043944/https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html |archivedate=2012-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Byzantium quickly became the main [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks|trading]] and cultural partner for Kiev, but relations were not always friendly. The most serious conflict between the two powers was the [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev#Campaigns in the Balkans|war of 968–971]] in Bulgaria, but several Rus' raiding expeditions against the Byzantine cities of the Black Sea coast and Constantinople itself are also recorded. Although most were repulsed, they were concluded by [[Rus'–Byzantine War (970–971)|trade treaties]] that were generally favourable to the Rus'.

Rus'-Byzantine relations became closer following the marriage of the ''[[porphyrogenita]]'' [[Anna Porphyrogeneta|Anna]] to [[Vladimir the Great]], and the subsequent [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Christianization of the Rus']]: Byzantine priests, architects and artists were invited to work on numerous cathedrals and churches around Rus', expanding Byzantine cultural influence even further. Numerous Rus' served in the Byzantine army as mercenaries, most notably as the famous [[Varangian Guard]].

In 988, the Christian Church in Rus' territorially fell under the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] after it was officially adopted as the state religion. According to several chronicles after that date the predominant cult of [[Slavic paganism]] was persecuted.

The exact date of creation of the Kiev Metropolis is uncertain, as well as who was the first leader of the church. Predominantly it is considered that the first head was [[Michael I of Kiev (metropolitan)|Michael I of Kiev]], however some sources also claim Leontiy who is often placed after Michael or Anastas Chersonesos, became the first bishop of the [[Church of the Tithes]]. The first metropolitan to be confirmed by historical sources is Theopemp, who was appointed by [[Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople]] in 1038. Before 1015 there were five dioceses: Kiev, Chernihiv, Bilhorod, Volodymyr, Novgorod, and soon thereafter [[Bila Tserkva|Yuriy-upon-Ros]]. The Kiev Metropolitan sent his own delegation to the [[Council of Bari]] in 1098.

After the sacking of Kiev in 1169, part of the Kiev metropolis started to move{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir-upon-Klyazma]], concluding the move sometime after 1240 when Kiev was taken by [[Batu Khan]]. Metropolitan Maxim was the first metropolitan who chose Vladimir-upon-Klyazma as his official residence in 1299. As a result, in 1303, [[Lev I of Galicia]] petitioned [[Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople]] for the creation of a new Halych metropolis; however, it only existed until 1347.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The [[Church of the Tithes]] was chosen as the first Cathedral Temple. In 1037, the cathedral was transferred to the newly built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]. Upon the transferring of the metropolitan seat in 1299, the [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir]] was chosen as the new cathedral.

By the mid 13th century, the dioceses of Kiev Metropolis (988) were as follows: Kiev (988), Pereyaslav, Chernihiv (991), Volodymyr-Volynsky (992), Turov (1005), Polotsk (1104), Novgorod (~990s), Smolensk (1137), Murom (1198), Peremyshl (1120), Halych (1134), Vladimir-upon-Klyazma (1215), Rostov (991), Bilhorod, Yuriy (1032), Chełm (1235), Tver (1271). There also were dioceses in [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Zakarpattia]] and [[Tmutarakan]]. In 1261 the Sarai-Batu diocese was established.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Image:Pico Orizaba Pines.jpg|thumb|400px|Pico de Orizaba (Citlaltépetl), a stratovolcano on the boundary between the states of Puebla and Veracruz, is the highest mountain peak of Mexico.]]

This article comprises four sortable tables of [[Summit|mountain summits]] of [[Mexico]] that are the [[Elevation|higher]] than any other point [[#Northernmost high summits|north]] or [[#Southernmost high summits|south]] of their [[latitude]] or [[#Easternmost high summits|east]] or [[#Westernmost high summits|west]] their [[longitude]] in Mexico.

The summit of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=range/&gt;&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The topographic prominence of a summit is the topographic elevation difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in Alaska is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in Nicaragua, {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence, and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500 meters of topographic prominence.  An [[ultra-prominent peak]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The topographic isolation of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2983">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded on and around Ascension Island'''. [[Ascension Island]] has two native mammal species, both of which are beaked whales in the genus [[Mesoplodon]]. Neither is thought to be at risk, but there is insufficient data collected on them to allow an assessment to be made.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 10 August 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| DD ||'''Data Deficient'''|| There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to this species.
|}

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of Near Threatened and Least Concern categories:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LR/cd || '''Lower Risk/conservation dependent''' || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued.
|-
| LR/nt || '''Lower Risk/near threatened''' || Species which are close to being classified as Vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes.
|-
| LR/lc || '''Lower Risk/least concern''' || Species for which there are no identifiable risks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1474">{{Politics of Réunion}}

Réunion is not a separate territory but a region of [[France]]. France has a [[multi-party]] system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form [[coalition government]]s.

For further details see the article: [[Politics of France]].

==The parties==
&lt;!--:''The general rule on naming applies. That means: the parties are named in the English translation and the original native name is placed on the first line of the article unless the native form is more commonly used in English than the English form. Rationale and specifics: See: [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)]]''.--&gt;

Most of the [[List of political parties in France|French political parties]] are active in Réunion.

In addition there is the following regional party:

* [[Communist Party of Réunion]] (''Parti communiste réunionnais'', or PCR)

'''Opus Center''' is a set of four office buildings built in [[Downtown Seattle]]. The structures, completed in 2000 or 2001, are four, nine and eleven stories tall&lt;!-- East=4 story, West=9, South=11 --&gt;, and two of them are constructed on a lid over the underground [[International District/Chinatown station|Chinatown transit station]], completed in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 9, 2000 |title=Opus Center @ Union Station |url=https://www.djc.com/special/unionstation/ |work=[[Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce]] |accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Opus Center East|work=[[Emporis]]|url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/119349/opus-center-east-seattle-wa-usa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Opus Center West|work=[[Emporis]]|url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/220007/opus-center-west-seattle-wa-usa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Opus Center South|work=[[Emporis]]|url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/220008/opus-center-south-seattle-wa-usa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2011 it was the headquarters of [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=OPUS CENTER AT UNION STATION|publisher=The Opus Group|url=https://www.opus-group.com/Work/Opus-Center-at-Union-Station}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering details==
The building's engineering is unusual because of the placement over the transit tunnel, and for other reasons. Part of the structure is cantilevered over the 1985 load-bearing columns that did not match the later building's design. Because of the tunnel, four buildings are designed as one seismic unit, including a rubber membrane serving as a joint between all the buildings and 505 Union Station. It was the first building in Seattle with perimeter [[Moment-resisting frame|moment frame]] design since the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], which exposed national safety concerns requiring re-review of this technique.&lt;ref name=Jago/&gt;

Luxembourg is a [[parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]] with a [[constitutional monarchy]], ruled by a [[Grand Duke]]. It is the world's only remaining sovereign [[Grand Duchy]]. The country has a highly developed economy, with the highest [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|Gross Domestic Product per capita]] in the world (U.S. Central Intelligence Agency 2007). Its historic and strategic importance dates back to its founding as a [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] [[Fortification|fortress]] site and [[Kingdom of the Franks|Frankish]] [[County|count's]] [[castle]] site in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. It was an important bastion along the [[Spanish road]] when Spain was the principal [[international power|European power]] influencing the whole western hemisphere and beyond in the 14th–17th centuries.

Luxembourg is a founding member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], the [[United Nations]], [[Benelux]], and the [[Western European Union]], reflecting the political consensus in favour of [[economic integration|economic]], political, and military integration.  The city of [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]], the [[capital (political)|capital]] and largest city, is the seat of several institutions and agencies of the European Union.

Luxembourg lies on the cultural divide between [[Romance language|Romance]] Europe and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] Europe, borrowing customs from each of the distinct traditions. Luxembourg is a [[trilingual]] country; [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] are [[official languages]]. Although a [[secular state]], Luxembourg is predominantly [[Roman Catholic]].

The '''[[Federated States of Micronesia]]''' &amp;ndash; [[island nation]] located in the [[North Pacific Ocean]], north of [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=July 2, 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fm.html|title=Federated States of Micronesia|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The country is a [[sovereign state]] in [[Associated state|free association]] with the [[United States]]. The Federated States of Micronesia were formerly part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]], a [[United Nations]] Trust Territory under US administration. In 1979 they adopted a [[constitution]], and in 1986 independence was attained under a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States. Present concerns include large-scale unemployment, overfishing, and dependence on U.S. aid.  The '''Federated States of Micronesia''' are located in the region known as [[Micronesia]], which consists of hundreds of small [[islands]] divided in seven [[Territory (country subdivision)|territories]]. The term ''Micronesia'' may refer to the Federated States or to the region as a whole, even though the lack of a central government makes it a sovereign group of states, not a [[country]].

'''Paristan''' or '''Pari-estan''' ({{lang-fa|پریستان}} ''Pariyestân'', "fairyland"; {{lang|fa|پری}} ''[[Peri|pari]]'' [fairy] + the suffix ''[[-stan]]'') is a name of a ''[[Fairyland|fairyland]]'' in the mythology of the [[Middle East]]. In many children's stories ''[[Koh-e-Qaf]]'' is also used for ''fairyland''. ''Koh-e-Qaf'' ({{lang-fa|کوہ قاف}}) refers to the [[Caucasus mountains]]. It has since entered the folklore of [[South Asia]] and [[Central Asia]].

Most of the fairies are depicted as young females with very fair colour, golden hair and light colored eyes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The location of Koh-e-Qaf is usually claimed to be around [[Baghdad]] ([[Iraq]]). The story named "Thief of Baghdad" mentions that the fairies of Koh-e-Qaf live in a place near [[Baghdad]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8570">[[Image:Piazzetta telematica for journalists -Italia90 - Roma.JPG|thumb|Piazzetta telematica "Italia '90" for journalists — Roma 1990.]]

In the fields of [[urban planning]], [[urban regeneration]] and [[e-government]], the term '''''piazza telematica''''' has been used in Italy since the early 1990s by a number of [[community network]] and local institutions for promoting the insertion, inside the urban upgrading processes, of the principles of [[sustainable development]] and of [[accessibility]] for all to [[Information technology|IT]] tools for assuring the Right of [[Citizenship]]: the possibilities to participate in public decision processes, to access to the knowledge and training, to take part of the social [[local community]] life.

The term piazza telematica evokes a hybrid space indebted in equal parts to the real (with territorial components) and the [[Virtuality|virtual]] space that has to be considered as a whole, a new [[glocal]] (global – local) [[public space]] with a great symbolic value for the [[democracy|democratic]] interaction and for the social life.

The word “[[piazza]]” underlines the semantic significance of a [[public space]] traditionally located in the heart of  the [[town]] centre or of  a [[village]] and dedicated to [[communication]], [[meeting]], and the exchange of material goods and, at present, through the use of telematics systems and services, to the exchange also of immaterial goods (new virtual services and functions: [[Telecommuting]], [[Coworking]], online [[Training]] through [[Multi-monitor]], [[Telemedicine]], [[Electronic commerce]] and the new [[Sustainable mobility]] services such as [[Bike sharing]] and [[Car sharing]].

== History ==
*1990 - The term Piazza Telematica is used for the first time in newspapers and magazines in order to describe the telematics systems and services set up for the journalists in the 12 Italian cities hosting the [[FIFA World Cup 1990]].
*1994 - Participation to the ACT-VILL project of the Direction XII [[Science]] and Technology of the [[European Union]] for the city of the 21st century corresponding to new concepts synthesised in three scenarios:
**[[Sustainable city]], a city that internalise the problems it generates, solving them instead of transferring to other or to the future. 
**"[[Glocal]]" city (global/local), a city with a better balance between the [[globalisation]] process and the ability to use local resources. 
**Post-modern or [[agora]] city, a human centred city with a harmonic relationship between the [[citizen]] and the [[urban design]].
*1995 - Participation to the European conference ''Urban utopias: new tools for the [[European Urban Renaissance]], promoted by the Direction XII [[Science]] and Technology of the [[European Union]] and hosted by the Municipality of [[Berlin]].
*2004 - The first pilot project of a Piazza Telematica, supported by the European Union (div. XVI for social cohesion and sustainable development) is opened to the general public in [[Naples]] (Italy) in the bourough of Scampia.

In some other pilot projects, as is the case for the Piazza Telematica of the Municipality of Provaglio d'Iseo, the term Piazza Telematica is used in order to evoke a virtual space on the Internet open to all citizens for the exchange of ideas, proposals and participation, through [[Internet forum|forum]] and other [[World Wide Web|web]] instruments, to the socio-cultural and economic life of the [[community]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3816">[[File:Magnetic North Pole Positions 2015.svg|thumb|The movement of Earth's North Magnetic Pole across the Canadian arctic.]]

'''Polar drift''' is a geological phenomenon caused by variations in the flow of molten [[iron]] in Earth's [[outer core]], resulting in changes in the orientation of [[Earth's magnetic field]], and hence the position of the magnetic [[magnetic north pole|north]] and [[South Magnetic Pole|south]] poles.

The [[North Magnetic Pole]] is approximately {{Convert|965|km|}} from the geographic [[north pole]]. The pole drifts considerably each day, and since 2007 it moves about {{Convert|55|to|60|km|abbr=on|0}} per year as a result of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/12/091224-north-pole-magnetic-russia-earth-core.html North Magnetic Pole Moving Due to Core Flux, National Geographic News, December 24, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South Magnetic Pole]] is constantly shifting due to changes in the Earth's magnetic field.
As of 2005 it was calculated to lie at {{Coord|64|31|48|S|137|51|36|E|region:AQ_type:landmark}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/faqgeom.shtml|title=Geomagnetism Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[NGDC]]|accessdate=11 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; placing it off the coast of Antarctica, between [[Adelie Land]] and [[Wilkes Land]]. In 2015 it lay at {{Coord|64.28|S|136.59|E|region:AQ_type:landmark}} (est).&lt;ref name=BritishGeological&gt;[http://www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk/education/poles.html British Geological Survey - Magnetic Poles]&lt;/ref&gt; That point lies outside the [[Antarctic Circle]] and it is moving northwest by about {{Convert|10|to|15|km|abbr=on|0}} per year. Its current distance from the actual [[South Pole|Geographic South Pole]] is approximately {{Convert|2860|km|}}.&lt;ref name="NGDC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Wandering of the Geomagnetic Poles |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/GeomagneticPoles.shtml |author=NOAA National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest permanent science station is [[Dumont d'Urville Station]].

The repetition method is used when high accuracy is required.

      <comment>Pruned multiple issues flags; two of them addressed the same problem, while the article doesn't give the appearance of containing original research, so much as needing additional or improved references in some sections (particularly the part concerning the use of gravel walks, which seems probable, but is unreferenced).  Expert attention may be warranted, but "generally incomplete article" is not a clear formulation of a problem.</comment>

[[Image:Thomas Bond Walker02.jpg|thumb|Lady in shrubbery, oil painting by Thomas Bond Walker (1861-1933)]]
A '''shrubbery''' is a wide border to a garden where [[shrub]]s are thickly planted, or a similar larger area with a path winding through it. A singular shrub is also known as a bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Heritage Dictionary|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
A shrubbery was a feature of 19th-century gardens in the [[English Garden|English manner]], with its origins in the gardenesque style&lt;ref&gt;John Warfield Simpson, ''Visions of Paradise: Glimpses of Our Landscape's Legacy'' 1999:297.&lt;/ref&gt; of the early part of the century. A shrubbery&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Kent, ''Sylvan Sketches Or A Companion To The Park And The Shrubbery With Illustrations From The Works Of The Poets'', (London) 1831.&lt;/ref&gt; was a collection of hardy shrubs, quite distinct from a [[flower garden]], which was a cutting garden to supply flowers in the house. The shrubbery was arranged as a walk, ideally a winding one, that made a circuit that brought the walker back to the terrace of the house. Its paths were gravel, so that they dried quickly after a rain. A walk in the shrubbery offered a chance for a private conversation, and a winding walk among shrubs surrounding even quite a small lawn was a feature of the garden behind a well-furnished [[English Regency|Regency]] suburban [[villa]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr Rushworth," said Lady Bertram, "if I were you, I would have a very pretty shrubbery. One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather." &amp;mdash;[[Jane Austen]], ''[[Mansfield Park (novel)|Mansfield Park]]'' (1814).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Structural components==
In the 1980s [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s never-executed plans for the garden setting of the [[Brighton Pavilion]], illustrated in Nash's volume ''Views of the Royal Pavilion'' (1826), were finally carried out in connection with the extensive restorations of the Pavilion itself.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Hinze, "The Re-Creation of John Nash's Regency Gardens at the Royal Pavilion, Brighton" ''Garden History'' '''24'''.1 (Summer 1996:45-53).&lt;/ref&gt; Its "fairly open landscape of soft lawns dotted with trees and set with lightly-wooded, sinuous shrubberies" are best illustrated in [[Augustus Charles Pugin]]'s&lt;ref&gt;Father of the better-known designer and architect [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin]].&lt;/ref&gt; watercolor view c. 1822 of the west front of the Pavilion,&lt;ref&gt;Hinze 1996:46, fig. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; reproduced in Nash's publication. The winding perimeter walk circling the lawn among the shrubs and trees, enriched with island beds of herbaceous perennials, began to be laid out in 1814, with a flush of activity 1817-21. Two books of commentaries proved indispensable for the replanting scheme. One was Henry Phillips, who wrote in 1823
&lt;blockquote&gt;The shrubbery is a style of pleasure-garden which seems to owe its creation to the idea that our [[John Milton|sublime poet]] formed of Eden. It originated in England and is as peculiar to the British nation as landscape planting.&lt;ref&gt;Philips, ''Sylva florifera. The Shrubbery, Historically and Botanically treated, with observations on the formation of Ornamental and Picturesque Scenery'' (London, 1823), quoted in Hinze 1996:49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The formulas for arranging a shrubbery were founded on contemporary painterly requirements for the [[Picturesque]]; judicious contrast and variety were essential, but Philips seems to have been among the first garden writers to notice that yellowish-green leaves in the foreground seem to throw bluish green-leaved shrubs deeper into a perceived distance.&lt;ref&gt;Philips 1823:23, noted by Hinze.&lt;/ref&gt; The desirable undulations of paths and islands and bands of shrub plantings would ideally undulate in elevation too: "break up the level by throwing up elevations,' Philips suggested, "so as to answer the double purpose of obscuring private walks and screening other parts from the wind."&lt;ref&gt;Philips 1823: I.20, quoted in Hinze 1996:51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nash was at work also on the public parks of London, devising the shrubberies of [[Regent's Park]] and of [[St. James's Park]], where the German visitor [[Hermann von Pückler-Muskau|Prince Pückler-Muskau]] discerned that
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr Nash ... masses the shrubs more closely together, allows the grass to disappear in wide sweeps under the plants or lets it run along the edges of the shrubs without trimming them ... hence they soon develop into a thicket that gracefully bends over the lawn without showing anywhere a sharply defined outline&lt;ref&gt;Pückler-Muskau, (S. Parsons, ed.) ''Hints on Landscape Gardening'' (Boston, 1971:71-72), noted by Hinze.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such precise effects were made immeasurably simpler by the invention in 1827 by the English engineer [[Edwin Beard Budding]] of the [[lawn mower|rotary lawn mower]], an extrapolation of machinery commonly used to cut velvet pile.

After the turn of the new century [[Gertrude Jekyll]] offered a chapter of suggestions for "Wood and Shrubbery Edges" in ''Colour Schemes for the Flower Garden'' (London, 1908) in which her descriptions were based on her own garden at [[Munstead Wood]], south of [[Godalming, Surrey]], but her shrubbery and hardy perennial plantings were designed to soften transitions: "Where woodland joins garden ground there is often a sudden jolt; the wood ends with a hard line, sometimes with a path along it, accentuating the defect."&lt;ref&gt;Jekyll 1908:92.&lt;/ref&gt; In the expansive space of even a small Edwardian garden, Miss Jekyll recommended a space "from twenty-five to forty feet" planted so as to bring wood and garden into harmony, "so planted as to belong equally to garden and wood." [[Rhododendron]]s were the stand-by in these shrub belts, combined with ferns, wood-rush, lilies, white foxgloves and white columbines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6871">'''Sustainable land management''' (SLM&lt;ref name=worldbank/&gt;) refers to practices and technologies that aim to integrate the [[land management|management of land]], [[water management|water]], [[biodiversity]], and other [[Environmental resource management|environmental resource]]s to meet human needs while ensuring the long-term [[sustainability]] of [[ecosystem]] services and livelihoods. The term sustainable land management is used, for example, in [[regional planning]] and [[soil]] or [[environmental protection]], as well as in property and estate management.

== Examples ==

The [[World Bank]] defines sustainable land management as a process in a charged environment between [[environmental protection]] and the guarantee claim of [[ecosystem services]] on the one hand. On the other hand, it is about productivity of [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] with respect to [[demographic growth]] and increasing pressure in [[land consumption|land use]].

{{quote|SLM is defined as a knowledge-based procedure that helps integrate land, water, biodiversity, and environmental management (including input and output externalities) to meet rising food and fiber demands while sustaining ecosystem services and livelihoods. SLM is necessary to meet the requirements of a growing
population. Improper land management can lead to [[land degradation]] and a significant reduction in the productive and service (biodiversity niches, [[hydrology]], [[carbon sequestration]]) functions of watersheds and landscapes."&lt;ref name=worldbank&gt;[https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/7132/366540PAPER0Su11PUBLIC0as0of0July71.txt?sequence=2 The World Bank (2006): Sustainable Land Management. Challenges, Opportunities, and Trade-offs. Washington, DC]&lt;/ref&gt;|The World Bank}}
  
The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) applies the term in a much wider context. Besides agriculture and forestry they include the mineral extraction sector, property and estate management.

{{quote|Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put to good effect. It covers all activities concerned with the management of land as a resource both from an environmental and from an economic perspective. It can include farming, mineral extraction, property and estate management, and the physical planning of towns and the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1996|title=Land Administration Guideline. With Special Reference to Countries in Transition|publisher=UN Economic Commission for Europe, Geneva, ECE/HBP/96|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/hlm/documents/Publications/land.administration.guidelines.e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the course of national politics and programmes, few [[Europe]]an states use the terminology "sustainable land management". Here [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] are to be mentioned, as both countries have agreed on sustainable land management with respect to climate change as part of their government programmes.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Australian Government – Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European context, the definition of the European Network for Land Use Management for Sustainable European Cities (LUMASEC)&lt;ref&gt;http://urbact.eu/en/projects/metropolitan-governance/lumasec/homepage&lt;/ref&gt; may be used as a reference. It emphasizes the inter- and transdisciplinary cooperation on sustainable land management:  

{{quote|As management is the human activity meaning the action of people working together in the aim to accomplish desired goals, land use management is a process of managing use and development of land, in which spatial, sector-oriented and temporary aspects of urban policy are coordinated. Resources of land are used for different purposes, which may produce conflicts and competitions, and land use management has to see those purposes in an integrated way. Therefore, land management covers the debate about norms and visions driving the policy-making, sector-based planning both in the strategic and more operative time spans, spatial integration of sectoral issues, decision-making, budgeting, implementation of plans and decisions and the monitoring of results and evaluation of impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Didier Vancutsem (LEAD Expert): 2008 Land Use Management for Sustainable European Cities&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Research examples==

Since 2010, the [[German Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] (BMBF) funds an international research program on "sustainable land management".&lt;ref&gt;Weith, T., Schulz, K., Gaasch, N., Seppelt, R., Werntze, A., Eppink, F. (2010): Towards Integration: Sustainable Land Management. A new German Research Funding Measure&lt;/ref&gt; Module A of the program investigates interactions between land management, [[climate change]], and ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;Seppelt, R., Dormann, C., Eppink, F. V., Lautenbach, S., Schmidt, S. (2011): A quantitative review of ecosystem studies: Approaches, shortcomings and the road ahead, Journal of Applied Ecology&lt;/ref&gt; It includes projects operating in [[South America]], [[Africa]], Europe, [[Central Asia]], and [[South Asia]]. Module B seeks "innovative system solutions" in 13 projects with a Central European focus.

Furthermore, [[Economics of Land Degradation Initiative | the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative]] seeks to establish a cost benefit analysis on the practice of sustainable land management highlighting its economic benefits. This economic analysis will enable decision makers to take appropriate measures combat [[land degradation]] globally. Additionally, the Initiative supports regional case studies focusing on [[Africa]] and [[Central Asia]].
