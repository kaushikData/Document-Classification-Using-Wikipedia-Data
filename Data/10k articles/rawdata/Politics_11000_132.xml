The '''First Conference of the Communist Parties of Latin America''' was in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], June 1–12, 1929.{{sfnm |1a1=Carr |1y=1978 |1p=982 |2a1=Miller |2y=1989 |2p=40}} Thirty-eight delegates, representing Argentina, [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Cuba]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Venezuela]], took part in the meeting. The only established [[communist party]] in the region that did not participate was the [[Communist Party of Chile]], which at time suffered a period of harsh repression under the government of [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]].{{sfn|Guerra|Prieto|1980|p=9}}

The conference agreed on an analysis of the Latin American political development, considering that the revolution in Latin America ought to be [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]], and [[democracy|democratic]]. The conference also committed itself to an accord of solidarity with the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Guerra|Prieto|1980|p=9}}

[[Ronaldo Munck]], Ricardo Falcón, and Bernardo Galitelli wrote that the conference "set the '[[Third Period]]' course for Latin American [[communism]] as a whole."{{sfn|Munck|Falcón|Galitelli|1987|p=105}}

* 1962. BCDP was incorporated as Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD), a prototype for urban “human renewal” agencies  (such as [[Community Action Agencies]]), with initial funding of $1.9 million from the [[Ford Foundation]]. Community activists, including [[Melnea Cass]],&lt;ref name="ABCDMELNEACASS"&gt;[http://massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=179 "On This Day: June 19, 1968: Melnea Cass"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126154007/http://massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=179 |date=November 26, 2010 }}, ''Mass Moments'', Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities. "She was a charter member of Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD), which helped people displaced by urban renewal."&lt;/ref&gt; founded ABCD.
* 1964. Congress passed the [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964|Economic Opportunity Act]] as part of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] campaign and its [[War on Poverty]]. The City of Boston designated ABCD as its official anti-poverty agency. ABCD established a neighborhood-based Area Planning Action Council (APAC) system to manage 11 target neighborhoods of acutely [[concentrated poverty]].&lt;ref name="ABCDHISTORY"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vote-usa.org/Intro.aspx?Id=makennedyedwardm "Profile: Senator Edward M. Kennedy"], Vote USA&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1967. ABCD started the Urban College Program to meet the educational, employment and career development needs of the adult community. This was a collaboration with major Boston area colleges and universities which enabled men and women over the years to earn academic credits toward undergraduate and graduate degrees while still acquiring job-related skills.&lt;ref name="URBANCOLLEGEHISTORY"&gt;[http://urbancollege.edu/history.htm Urban College of Boston History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720100624/http://urbancollege.edu/history.htm |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1973. ABCD and three other community action agencies filed a successful [[Class action|class action suit]] to prevent United States President [[Richard Nixon]] from abolishing the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]].&lt;ref name="ABCDHISTORY"/&gt;
* 1982. ABCD received an award received from United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] for the private sector initiative in the ABCD/[[FleetBoston Financial|Shawmut Bank]]/[[Bank of New England]] Training Program.&lt;ref name="ABCDHISTORY"/&gt;
* 1985. The Housing Services Program was established.&lt;ref name="ABCDHISTORY"/&gt;
* 1993. The Massachusetts Board of Higher Education gives a charter as a degree-granting institution of higher education to the [[Urban College of Boston]], a two-year college, set up by ABCD.
* January 2006. The Urban College of Boston received continued accreditation from the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] (NEASC), Inc. Commission on Institutions of Higher Education.&lt;ref name="URBANCOLLEGEHISTORY"/&gt;
* November 2009. Following the death of long-time president and CEO, Robert M. Coard (who had worked for ABCD since 1964 and was its Executive Director since 1968),&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, J.M., [http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2009/11/05/robert_coard_as_abcd_leader_with_golden_touch_fought_poverty_for_half_century/ "Robert Coard; as ABCD leader with ‘golden touch,’ fought poverty for half century"], ''The Boston Globe'', November 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ABCD's board of directors named John J. Drew as Coard's successor. Prior to his accepting the top post, Drew had served for more than 20 years as ABCD's Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbur.org/2009/11/04/obit-coard "Robert Coard: Obituary"], ''[[WBUR]]'' radio, November 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massnonprofit.org/news.php?artid=1709&amp;catid=11 "John Drew Is New President/CEO at ABCD; Robert Coard Dies"], ''massnonprofit.org'', November 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mass murder and [[genocide]] have linked  historically to the Belgian colonial occupation of the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]] in the 1890 during which ten million people were massacred as part of the initiative of pacification. The controlling European powers that had defined their mission as the civilization of "uncivilized" peoples; elimination of slavery; redemption of souls through religious conversion and expansion of international commerce maintained that the main conflicts in the region were due to tribal hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The genocide and mass murder committed in the Congo paved the road for a century of mass slaughter throughout Africa, with the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide]] in the German protectorate of [[German South West Africa|Namibia]] serving as the dress rehearsal for the [[Holocaust]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]], in which [[Nazi Germany]]'s annihilation of six million European Jews finally brought the issue of genocide to the fore front of international attention.&lt;ref name=Madley&gt;{{cite journal

===Establishment of the ACRI===

The ACRI's immediate objective was to increase the number of African states with effective response capability for peace keeping and humanitarian relief challenges, thereby improving stability and peace within their own borders and their sub-regions&lt;ref name="Clinton1999"&gt;

The pressing reason for establishing the ACRI at the time had been the imminent possibility of a major genocide in [[Burundi]], similar to the ethnic cleansing which had [[Rwandan genocide|taken place]] in 1994 in [[Rwanda]]. However, once the ACRI was formed, these murders continued yet the force never officially intervened. Until its replacement by ACOTA by the ACRI in 2004 and despite ongoing mass murders occurring in the [[Darfur]] province of the [[Sudan]], the U.S. government never deployed the ACRI forces to put pause to genocide in Africa, despite the ACRI’s founding
articles, which call for humanitarian intervention in Africa no action was taken.

==Criticism==
The harrowing losses of the U.S. military in [[Somalia]] were instrumental in the creation of the ACRI. In 1992, following the fall of the [[Siad Barre]] regime, the U.S. opted for a military intervention which it named [[Restore Hope]] but the operation soon escalated when the focus shifted from humanitarian aid to an attempt at restructuring Somalia’s government. By 1993 following the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)]], portrayed in the book and movie [[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]],&lt;ref name="Bowden2001"&gt;{{cite book

African leaders including [[President of South Africa|South African President]] [[Nelson Mandela]] considered the formation of the ACRI  as a cynical attempt by the U.S. to improve its image following the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. The United States which had been willing to mobilize the [[United Nations]] to stop ethnic cleansing in European [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]] has ensured that the UN did not send troops to end the Rwandan genocide in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) convened a panel of experts to investigate the genocide in Rwanda. They  concluded that during the civil war, genocide had occurred, and pointed to the tolerance for genocidal violence committed by African leaders. By naming their report ''"Rwanda: The Preventable Genocide"'', the panel pointed to the United States and UN as responsible for this tragedy. Regional leaders such as [[Michel Micombero]] of Burundi,  [[Idi Amin]] of Uganda, [[Emperor Bokassa]] of the Central African Republic and [[Mobutu]] of [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Zaire]] directly and indirectly contributed to the commencement war and genocide by taking a stance of indifference toward state-implemented criminal recommendation which had exploited myths of Tutsi and Hutu origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cec.rwanda2.free.fr/doc/Rapport_OUA/Rwanda-f/oua.htm|title=Rwanda: The Preventable Genocide|author=[[Gerald Caplan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Rumo a liberdade Henrique Matos.jpg|thumb|230px|A mural dedicated to the MFA, it reads: ''Towards freedom. Long live the 25th of April!'']]
The '''Armed Forces Movement''' ({{lang-pt|Movimento das Forças Armadas}}; '''MFA''') was an organisation of lower-ranked left-leaning officers in the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]]. It was responsible for the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 25 April 1974, a [[military coup]] in [[Lisbon]] that ended the [[corporatist]] [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|New State regime]] ({{lang|pt|Estado Novo}}) in [[Portugal]], the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] and led to the independence of the Portuguese overseas territories. The MFA instated the [[National Salvation Junta]] ({{lang|pt|Junta de Salvação Nacional}}) which functioned between 1974 and 1976, following a communiqué of its president, [[António de Spínola]], at 1:30 a.m. on 26 April 1974.

==Causes of the revolutionary coup==
The military-led coup can be described as the necessary means of bringing back democracy to Portugal, ending the unpopular [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]] where thousands of Portuguese soldiers had been commissioned into military service, and replacing the [[authoritarian]] ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' (New State) regime and [[PIDE#DGS|its secret police]] which repressed elemental [[civil liberties]] and [[political freedom]]s. In addition, academics have published works theorizing that the efforts made by the MFA were not in the strict interest of the people of Portugal or its Overseas Provinces, since the movement was initiated not as an attempt to liberate Portugal from the authoritarian [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, but as an attempt of rebellion against the new Military Laws that were to be presented the next year (Decree Law: ''Decretos-Leis n.os 353, de 13 de Julho de 1973, e 409, de 20 de Agosto'').&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} Movimento das Forças Armadas (MFA).

Caetano's [[Portuguese Government]] had begun the program (which included several other reforms) in order to increase the number of officials employed against the African insurgencies, and at the same time cut down military costs to alleviate an already overburdened [[government budget]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], [[Time Magazine]] (Monday, 7 Jul. 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The MFA developed in the early 1970s as a movement of [[Captain (land and air)|Captains]] (''movimento dos capitães''), young officers who had been involved in the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]] against the separatist movements in the African overseas provinces of [[Portuguese West Africa|Angola]], [[Portuguese East Africa|Mozambique]], and [[Portuguese Guinea]]. What motivated the 'Captains' was, essentially, a desire for back wages and the freedom until then denied to the Portuguese people and the dissatisfaction with the policies followed by the government in relation to the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]] and Military Law. The principal aims of the MFA were the immediate completion of the [[Portuguese Colonial War]], retreat from Portuguese Africa, establish free elections and the abolition of the secret police, the [[PIDE/DGS]]. The revolution was planned by Vasco Lourenço, [[Vasco Gonçalves]] and [[Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho]] the chief strategist who directed operations. [[Salgueiro Maia]] commanded the troops deployed from the School of [[Cavalry]] at [[Santarém (district)|Santarém]]. Most of the officers had leftist sympathies and connections to the [[Portuguese Communist Party]].&lt;ref name ="infiltrated communists"&gt;Stewart Lloyd-Jones, [[ISCTE]] (Lisbon), [http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/media/Textos/portugal-since-1974.pdf Portugal's history since 1974], "The Portuguese Communist Party (PCP–Partido Comunista Português), which had courted and infiltrated the MFA from the very first days of the revolution, decided that the time was now right for it to seize the initiative. Much of the radical fervour that was unleashed following Spínola's coup attempt was encouraged by the PCP as part of their own agenda to infiltrate the MFA and steer the revolution in their direction.", Centro de Documentação 25 de Abril, [[University of Coimbra]]&lt;/ref&gt; After a failed initial attempt in March 1974 the coup took place on the morning of 25 April. Within a few hours  Lisbon was completely occupied by troops loyal to the MFA. Prime Minister [[Marcello Caetano]] handed over power to [[General]] [[António de Spínola]]. As a consequence of 25 April 1974 the MFA mobilised the army and announced the three 'Ds: [[Democratisation]], [[Decolonisation]] and [[Development studies|Development]].

==Transition to democracy==
The systematic demolition of the old order was inaugurated by the MFA-led ''[[Junta de Salvação Nacional]]''. As the pro-[[communist]] inspiration of the ''Junta'' was becoming increasingly evident, and far-left factions were taking the leading edge of the revolution, the process was halted by the [[coup of 25 November 1975]]. This period of social and political unrest which ensued after the 25 April military coup, is known as PREC ([[Processo Revolucionário Em Curso]]), where leftist and rightist factions struggled for supremacy within the Portuguese society and political institutions. The moderates eventually won and this prevented post-revolutionary Portugal from becoming a communist or [[right wing]]-ruled regime. Finally, the [[Portuguese legislative election, 1976]] took place on 25 April, exactly one year after the previous election, and two years after the [[Carnation Revolution]]. These elections could be said to be the definitive end of a period of revolution. Moderate democratic parties received most of the vote. Revolutionary achievements were not discarded, however. The constitution pledged the country to realize [[socialism]]. Furthermore, the constitution declared the extensive nationalizations and land seizures of 1975 irreversible (many would be ruled illegal some years later). The military supported these commitments through a pact with the main political parties that guaranteed its guardian rights over the new democracy for four more years.

'''Australian ufology''' refers to a historical series of [[Australian]] events and or activities pertaining to government departments, civilian groups or individual Australians, which centre on or around the study of [[Unidentified Flying Object]] (UFO) reports, sightings, encounters and other related phenomena, known as [[ufology]] within the Australian context before 1984.

==History==
Early reports about UFOs in and around Australia date back prior to 1947. However, the [[Kenneth Arnold unidentified flying object sighting|Kenneth Arnold case]] (June 1947) and the [[Roswell UFO incident]] (July 1947) became international press items and appeared in Australian newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Flying Saucers' to be hunted down: Mystery has U.S. baffled|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22449480?|accessdate=30 November 2011|newspaper=The Argus|date=7 July 1947|author=AAP (New York)|location=Melbourne, Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940s===
The first gathering of UFO enthusiasts occurred in [[Melbourne]] in March 1949 at the Federal Government's newly established Aeronautical Research Laboratory (ARL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agency details for: CA 2307|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/DetailsReports/AgencyDetail.aspx?reg_no=CA+2307|work=RecordSearch|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  minutes of the non-government meeting show an attendance of 23 enthusiasts from various state and local groups such as the [[British Interplanetary Society]],&lt;ref&gt;The Melbourne Branch of the Society formed in 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] (RAS), [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]] (CAC), [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and the [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation|Army Research Establishment]]. By May 1949, this gathering of enthusiasts became known as Aeronautical &amp; Meteorological Phenomena Research (AMPR)&lt;ref&gt;AMPR and AFSIC are the same group Doc NAA Point #2 http://naa16.naa.gov.au/rs_images/ShowImage.php?B=1948052&amp;S=162&amp;T=R&lt;/ref&gt; led by Brian Boyle and Jack Seers. AMPR started to list and research UFO stories and produced a small quarterly publication called ''Interplanetary Saucer''.&lt;ref name=Boyle1961&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyle|first=Brian|title=The Early Years: From Saucers to UFOs|year=1961|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s===
[[File:AFSB1955.JPG|frame|This cover comes from the 6th edition of the Australian Flying Saucer Bureau (AFSB) publication called the ''Australian Flying Saucer Magazine''. Six were produced from May 1953 to Feb 1955. - No 6, February 1955, 8 pages, 21&amp;nbsp;cm x 28&amp;nbsp;cm - image source PRA Melbourne.]]

AMPR's workload increased as the world ran into its next major sightings flap. In 1951 AMPR became Aeronautics &amp; Phenomena Research Victoria (APRV).

In May 1952, R. M. Seymour, Superintendent of the Federal Civil Aviation Department, Air Traffic Control Branch Melbourne, reported that Australian Intelligence officers had refused his Department permission to investigate flying saucer reports on the grounds that UFOs were "security matters".&lt;ref&gt;See Australian Flying Saucer Review, vol1, #, 2 April 1960, p1&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1952, Edgar Jarrold founded the Australian Flying Saucer Bureau (AFSB) in [[Sydney]]. Its headquarters were in [[Fairfield, New South Wales|Fairfield]].&lt;ref name=NAA114-1-197&gt;{{cite report|page=169|title=Reports on flying saucers (UFO's) and other aerial objects—October 1953−April 1955|publisher=National Archives of Australia|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/DetailsReports/ItemDetail.aspx?Barcode=1948052}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFSB began publishing the ''Australian Flying Saucer Magazine'' in May 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Australian Flying Saucer Magazine|publisher=Australian Flying Saucer Bureau|date=May 1953|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, the APRV made contact with Jarrold and agreed that the AFSB and APRV would assist each other when possible. The APRV nominated John. M. Anderson as their AFSB liaison on the condition that his appointment was seen only as being neutral, and there would be no branch affiliation with AFSB. Apparently Jarrold was seen by APRV as a secretive "loose gun"{{sfn|Boyle|1961|p=12}} but both groups maintained an average working relationship.

AMPR decided on 6 February 1953 to form an auxiliary group called the Australian Flying Saucer Investigating Committee (AFSIC) in partnership with the Astronomical Society of Victoria (ASV).

Such was the interest in UFOs during the period that on 20 November 1953, [[Alexander Downer, Sr.|Alexander Downer]], the member for the Federal [[Division of Angas (1949–77)|Division of Angas]], enquired during Question Time in the House of Representatives about whether the RAAF was investigating the UFO phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|jurisdiction=Commonwealth of Australia|house=House of Representatives|date=20 November 1953|page=364|speaker=Alexander Downer|position=Member for Angas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Air]], [[William McMahon]] (later Prime Minister) replied that the saucers were a problem "more for psychologists than for defence authorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|jurisdiction=Commonwealth of Australia|house=House of Representatives|date=20 November 1953|page=364|speaker=William McMahon|position=Minister for Air}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1954, AFSIC released a study of 55 sightings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Ray|last2=Bristol|first2=Les|title=The Victorian UFO report, 1954: a compilation of reports from the Victorian press|year=1978|publisher=Victorian UFO Research Society|location=Moorabbin, Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lord Casey.jpg|thumb|right|[[Baron Casey]]]]

The flying saucer topic came under intense criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle: 1961 p9&lt;/ref&gt; Public support for the continuation of investigation into the UFO phenomenon was driven by newspaper coverage of the 1954 sightings. Then-Federal [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Minister for External Affairs]] and [[Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Australia)|Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|Richard Casey]] wrote a letter to ''The Advertiser'' newspaper (Adelaide) which was published on 30 January 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Casey|first=Richard|title=Flying saucer theory|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47566536|accessdate=30 November 2011|newspaper=The Advertiser|date=30 January 1954|location=Adelaide, South Australia|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clipping included this:

{{quote|text=I have lists of the dates over the last several years on which people have reported having seen ‘flying saucers’ in Australia and have compared them with the dates on which the earth passes through the principal (sic) meteoric showers. There appears to be a noticeable relationship between these two sets of dates.|sign=R. G. Casey, Minister for External Affairs}}

[[Baron Casey]] was a member of APRV. His time as Minister in charge of the [[CSIRO]] and as Minister for External Affairs enabled him to act as a conduit between governmental research, the public, and public enthusiast clubs. Casey’s curiosity on the subject related to UFOs remained with him until his death in June 1976.

In March 1954 Jarrold was contacted by a South Australian called Fred Stone. Stone agreed to form a branch of Jarrold’s group and so the AFSB (SA) was formed. However, this relationship was fragile and as Jarrold's behavior changed due to stress the relationship deteriorated. The [[RAAF]] also noted problems with Jarrold. Sq Leader A.H. Birch, AFC, Air Force Headquarters, Victoria Barracks, Victoria, made note of this in a letter dated 5 April 1955: "...the discussion during the brief interview I had with Mr. Jarrold mainly concerned the possibility of his Society causing embarrassment to the Royal Australian Air Force." &lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;http://naa16.naa.gov.au/rs_images/ShowImage.php?B=1948052&amp;S=37&amp;T=P National Archives of Australia: A705/1, 114/1/197, digital image p37&lt;/ref&gt;

The RAAF then changed their policy and shifted their help to other organisations within Australia. "The Director would be happy to extend this service to your Society also."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;
After Sq/Ld Birch meeting with Edger Jarrold's UFO group AFSB collapsed (in February 1955), in just under four years, Jarrold departed the active UFO scene for good, only to appear on rare occasions.

After this, a new state group emerged. The most prominent and first to re-build was under the directorship of Fred Stone, who formed the Australian Flying Saucer Research Society (AFSRS) based in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] in February 1955. &lt;ref&gt;http://naa16.naa.gov.au/rs_images/ShowImage.php?B=1948052&amp;S=42&amp;T=P National Archives of Australia: A705/1, 114/1/197, digital image p42&lt;/ref&gt; Stone also saw a chance to become the governing body of all Australian Ufology. He asked APRV to come under his plan; they rejected the concept. However, APRV agreed to extend the same relationship they extended to Jarrold's group with John. M. Anderson&lt;ref&gt;See p42 LHS Col NAA http://naa16.naa.gov.au/rs_images/ShowImage.php?B=1948052&amp;S=42&amp;T=P National Archives of Australia: A705/1, 114/1/197, digital image p42&lt;/ref&gt; as their contact. This arrangement was agreed to and APRV supplied a list of contacts for Stone on possible branch organisers. Stone's plan was to form three new state groups (Victoria, NSW, and Queensland) under his control. With a new members list Stone set his plan into motion. Although each new group developed due to individuals within these groups, in the end Stone had little input into the other two state groups' structure. His concept worked at first but soon ran into administration problems due to distance between states and distant lines of communication.

In April 1956 to deal with an increase in reports the Aeronautics &amp; Phenomena Research Victoria (APRV) changed their structure and name to Phenomena Research Victoria (PRV).

In November 1957 an upwelling of public interest produced the formation of new groups around Australia. The majority of these new state groups did not accept Fred Stone's 1955 plan; those who accepted it only lasted one year before they decided to operate under their own administration. In late 1957 a new group started in Sydney called the Northern Suburbs Flying Saucer Research Association (NSFSRA), established under Mr &amp; Mrs D. Moore.&lt;ref&gt;Private correspondence, George Adamski to David Moor – Jan 1958&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Private correspondence, Mrs. Erica Ingram-Moore to George Adamski - Dec 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Mirror 19 Feb 1959 "They'll talk Flying Saucers - U.S. 'Expert' drops in"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Daily Telegraph 25 Feb 1959 "When the space people landed"&lt;/ref&gt;

Queensland members called for an independent structure and went their own way. They formed the Queensland Flying Saucer Research Bureau (QFSRB), now known as UFO Research Queensland (UFORQld), formed under Charles Middleborough in 1956 and with Stan Seers from 1957. These new groups were infiltrated and members came under the watchful eye of the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO), as seen in a report dated 4 August 1959. Dossiers and comments on Stan Seers and QFSRB members were produced for the ASIO Regional Director.&lt;ref&gt;http://naa16.naa.gov.au/rs_images/ShowImage.php?B=8194228&amp;S=22&amp;T=P National Archives of Australia: A6122, digital image p22&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in Victoria the Australian Flying Saucer Research Society (Victorian Branch) (AFSRS Vic), now known as the Victorian UFO Research Society (VUFORS), under Peter E. Norris LL.B and John Pinkney, was formed on 17 February 1957 at [[Melbourne University]]. In the first months of 1957 it was a branch of the Australian Flying Saucer Research Society (AFSRS) but later that year it also became independent and was re-organised as the Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society (VFSRS).&lt;ref&gt;http://naa16.naa.gov.au/rs_images/ShowImage.php?B=756666&amp;S=86&amp;T=P National Archives of Australia:A703/115, 580/1/1 PART 3, digital image p86&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time the Australian Flying Saucer Research Society (NSW Branch) (AFSRS NSW) was formed. This branch followed Victoria's lead and decided to become independent from Fred Stone's South Australia group AFSRS. The NSW membership decided to again change their structure and name and thus became the UFO Investigation Centre (UFOIC) under Dr. W.P. Clifford 1957.

UFOIC's start was overshadowed by a large, more active Sydney group, the Northern Suburbs Flying Saucer Research Association.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; The two Sydney groups competed for members and soon the relationship between the two broke down. NSFSRA became the central NSW group, primarily due to their public support and hosting of George Adamski on his 1959 Australian visit, organised by Victorian and Queensland Groups. Adamski held his Sydney lecture at Adyar Hall on 27 February 1959. Adamski's visit resulted in UFOIC membership falling away dramatically until it was basically a small, close-knit group of enthusiasts. So bitter was the dispute, UFOIC President Dr. Greenwell resigned in disgust; this opened the position to Dr Miran Lindtner who became president in March 1959. The damage had been done and the Sydney experience scared the NSW UFO community.

===1960s===
The Australian space industry was in full swing and slowly, research facilities that were based in Victoria moved to South Australia and the [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]] Rocket Range. These departmental changes started to affect the administration and membership of PRV. To keep up with the changing world, in 1961, the old AMPR again changed their structure and name from Phenomena Research Victoria (PRV) to Phenomena Research Australia (PRA).&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Brian, The Early Years: From Saucers to UFOs, Phenomena Research Victoria, 1961, pp6&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February 1965, in the country town of [[Ballarat]], Victoria, Australia held its first UFO group congregation. The conference was arranged by W. Howard Sloane, of the Ballarat Astronomical Society. The [[RAAF]] was represented by B.G. Roberts, a senior research scientist with the Operational Research Office (ORO), [[Department of Air (Australia)|Department of Air]], Canberra and two RAAF officers to look after a display. Air Marshal Sir [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]] (who had an interest in UFOs) also attended. Keynote speakers, including the Rev. William Gill&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;DEATH - Reverend William (Bill) Booth Gill (1928-2007) - Died 13 June 2007 - age of 79. His funeral service was held at the Church of Holy Trinity, Anglican Parish of Surrey Hills, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; and Charles Brew, gave accounts of their very public UFO experiences. At the conference, a new public group structure was named Commonwealth Aerial Phenomena Investigation Organisation (CAPIO). The assembly voted it into existence, and out of proceedings lawyer Peter E. Norris LL.B (Melb) became CAPIO's first President, under the patronage of Air Marshal Sir George Jones. &lt;ref&gt;http://naa16.naa.gov.au/rs_images/ShowImage.php?B=3185253&amp;S=50&amp;T=P National Archives of Australia: A8520, HM1/30, digital image p50&lt;/ref&gt;

October 1965, after setup delays, the Tasmania UFO Investigation Centre (TUFOIC) was founded under Keith Roberts and Paul Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Keith, A Short History of TUFOIC, Tasmania UFO Investigation Centre (TUFOIC), 2000, pp1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, a new group based at Woomera was set up called the Scientific Technical and Astronomical Research Society. This group of scientific and technical personnel collected UFO reports from the [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]] rocket range and local area. With the demise of the British and Australian rocket program, the group was disbanded in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;WOOMERA Scientific Technical and Astronomical Research Society part 1 NAA 978675 Ser No D250 Control 56/3568 Part 1 pp100 [http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/ItemDetail.asp?M=0&amp;B=978675]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 October 1966, the Department of Air wrote to the [[CSIRO]] advising that "Sighting of Unidentified Flying Objects have during recent months been receiving considerable publicity... it is important that the system of investigation should make the best use of resources available in Australia."&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;http://naa16.naa.gov.au/rs_images/ShowImage.php?B=3185253&amp;S=49&amp;T=P National Archives of Australia: A8520, HM1/30, digital image p49&lt;/ref&gt; The DOA invited the CSIRO to comment on specific UFO cases to be sent to them by the RAAF. The minutes of the 92nd meeting of the CSIRO executive committee on 25 October 1966 (See para 10&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; revealed that the CSIRO agreed to the DOA’s request. They responded on 7 November 1966, "The organisation is quite happy to assist in this way... and to provide you with comments."&lt;ref&gt;http://naa16.naa.gov.au/rs_images/ShowImage.php?B=3185253&amp;S=47&amp;T=P National Archives of Australia: A8520, HM1/30, digital image p47&lt;/ref&gt;

====State collaboration fractures====
For years, there was a general underground friction or competitiveness between groups, focused primary on Victorian groups. Norris and his group VFSRS pressed the need for an active government research input and created the linking opportunities with various government bodies for this process. A document to ASIO quotes AFSRS President Fred Stone as lacking trust in the Victorian group and reported that they were associated with a Sydney UFO Group that was controlled by people with "Pink" tendencies. &lt;ref&gt;http://naa16.naa.gov.au/rs_images/ShowImage.php?B=8194228&amp;S=17&amp;T=P National Archives of Australia: A6122, 2004/00053526, digital image p17&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1963, the South Australian group was finished, which led to a push from Sydney to take control of the state group's magazine. On 23 February 1967, UFOIC V/Pres Mr. Harry O’Brian &lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Australia: A1336/1, 68837, digital image p12&lt;/ref&gt; made an application&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Australia: A1336/1, 68837, digital image p16&lt;/ref&gt; for copyright on the state group's magazine ''Australian Flying Saucer Review''. Victoria and Queensland protested, the application failed, and VFSRS closed the door on Sydney. UFOIC continued publishing a newsletter from 1964 until late 1979.

In 1968, the Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society (VFSRS) was re-organised and its name was again altered - this time to the Victorian U.F.O. Research Society (VUFORS).

On 26 June 1968, in a letter from the Australian Governments Department of External Affairs to the Secretary Prime Minister's Department, the following policy observations are recorded: "...the history of this subject reveals that the more time and effort that is spent by experienced scientists in investigating the smaller becomes the residue of unexplained phenomena... in spite of these difficulties the Australian Government continue to keep records of "sighting" and associated phenomena reported within Australian and associated territories." &lt;ref&gt;http://naa16.naa.gov.au/rs_images/ShowImage.php?B=3185253&amp;S=7&amp;T=P National Archives of Australia: A8520, HM1/30, digital image p7&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1969, Phenomena Research Australia (PRA) changed their policy and opened limited membership to the general public with a new newsletter called ''UFO And Phenomena''.&lt;ref&gt;National Library Of Australia Call Number: Nq 001.942 UFO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auchettl, John, The Roots of Australian Ufology, Victorian UFO Research Society (VUFORS), 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
In late 1970, Tasmania UFO Investigation Centre (TUFOIC) produced the ''Tasmanian UFO Report'', later ''TUFOIC Newsletter'', a magazine that covered 86 issues (1970 to 1999).

On 30 October 1971, a symposium was held in Adelaide. The symposium, on UFOs, was organised by the SA Division of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anzaas.org.au (ANZAAS)&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian groups VUFORS and PRA invited Dr. [[J. Allen Hynek]] to visit Australia. He accepted the invitation and in 1973 arrived in Australia, spending four days in Melbourne, followed by short stops in Sydney, ACT, Brisbane and [[Papua New Guinea]]. While in Victoria, Dr. Hynek also met with Rev. William Gill,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; who was involved in the famous "close encounters of the third kind" case that occurred in the Anglican mission village at Boianai, [[Papua (Australian territory)|Papua]], New Guinea,. He also journeyed to Papua, which enabled him to undertake a detailed on site investigation into this famous case. Victorian members of VUFORS and PRA arranged that, during his stay in the ACT, he was able to talk with Shamus O'Farrell, discussing O'Farrell's famous 1954 Sea Fury incident.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Magee, Judith, The History of VUFORS, Victorian UFO Research Society (VUFORS), 1998, pp1 - http://members.ozemail.com.au/~vufors/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Magee, Judith, VUFORS 40th Birthday - (1957 - 1997), Victorian UFO Research Society (VUFORS), 1997, pp1 - http://members.ozemail.com.au/~vufors/bday40.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Harry Griesberg and David Seargent established the Australian Co-ordination Section (ACOS) of the US-based Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). This followed the 1973 visit to Australia of Dr J. Allen Hynek, who requested that Australian ufologists forward copies of interesting Australian sighting reports to CUFOS in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Moravec "Journal Cuadernos de Ufologia", 1997-98 then reprinted in the UK journal "Fortean Studies", 1999, Vol6 {{ISBN|1-902212-20-7}}, para 1 p110&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Dr Martin Gottschall, ACUFOS - {{cite web|url=http://www.acufos.asn.au/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015022239/http://www.acufos.asn.au/index.html |archivedate=15 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, VUFORS changed direction following the resignation of Peter Norris. A new executive was placed in control, ensuring the continuing prosperity of VUFORS. By 1978 VUFORS had the largest membership of any UFO organisation in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.ozemail.com.au/~vufors/history.htm http://members.ozemail.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.ozemail.com.au/~vufors/bday40.htm http://members.ozemail.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Defence UFO files open====
Although the UFO files were available to Defence personnel and Civilians Defence personnel for years, these files remained closed to outside researchers. In October 1979, extensively through the efforts of VUFORS researchers and Fl/Lt Brett Biddington&lt;ref&gt;''Bendigo Advertiser'', 25 May 1983, front page&lt;/ref&gt; (later Group Captain - RAAF), the RAAF invited Victorian researchers to visit the Intelligence Cell at RAAF Headquarters Support Command, [[Victoria Barracks, Melbourne|Victoria Barracks]], Victoria, to view the majority files collection and copy what they wished.&lt;ref&gt;File note: “Note for further Intelos lumbered with questions about F…. V…. “In 1983 all paper work on V…..’s disappearance was photocopied by the UFO Research Society in Victoria and all enquiries should be directed to them.” CINTO. 10 Feb 1989. File 5/6/1/AIR Part 8. 9755-4 “UFO-reports” HQ Support Command. Folios 10 Jan 78 to 10 Feb 89&lt;/ref&gt; This was a significant 'turn around' by the Defence Force, but it was the start of a period of remarkable co-operation between government departments and civilian groups. It was not until 1981 that another change in policy was instigated. A selection of general UFO files could be sent to Defence HQ, Russell Office, Canberra, when requested. The limited selection became open to other civilians for research after being vetted by a second controlling officer, but after their inspection they were returned to the Victorian collection.&lt;ref&gt;Auchettl, John, The Roots of Australian Ufology, Victorian UFO Research Society (VUFORS), 1985, pp34&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
By 1980, ACOS became the Australian Centre for UFO Studies (ACUFOS) by 1985 (to this day) under the control of Dr Martin Gottschall.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; UFO Research Australia (UFORA) was formed by Vladimir and Pony Godic. Their first newsletter was published in January 1980 in South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=11&amp;ti=1,11&amp;Search%5FArg=ufo&amp;Search%5FCode=JALL&amp;SL=Submit%26TYPE%3Das%7C0%26TYPE%3Dab%7C1&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=20689&amp;SEQ=20061230202718&amp;SID=1 National Library Of Australia Call Number: Nq 001.9420994 UFO]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
The structure of Australian Government is in three tiers. The lowest level is Local Council, above that is the State Government and over these sits the Federal Government. Throughout the modern era of Australian ufology, departments of the Federal government have played the major role of official inquisitor. The State Government does play a minor role; however, archival evidence reveals that when a State body gets involved their primary object is to pass the case up to the Federal sphere.

===Reports===
RAAF dealt with more than 400 between 1950 and 1959 and over 1,300 reports between 1960 and 1980. The Department of Air produced Unusual Aerial Sightings (UAS) lists for the public. Three such examples are:
* Summary No1&amp;nbsp;January 60 - Dec 68&lt;ref&gt;[http://naa16.naa.gov.au/rs_images/ShowImage.php?B=1826380&amp;S=5&amp;T=P National Archives of Australia:PP959/1/0, 5/3/AIR, digital image p5].&lt;/ref&gt;

These above samples lists are from the West Australian, National Archives of Australia (NAA) files. However, it is known that there are over 10,000 files in over 130 folders on the topic of UFOs or flying saucers located within the NAA 60&amp;nbsp;million file collection. After 1980, Government UFO reports that were in external departments were culled and then scattered throughout Australia to NAA storage areas,&lt;ref&gt;The NAA advise Phenomena Research Australia [PRA] that the UFO files can now be viewed on the net.

&lt;small&gt;Note: This above list is far from complete; however, it does lists important pages from the main Government sections that held or handled UFO reports.&lt;/small&gt;

From 1930 to 1959, the majority collection of Defence UFO files were held at HQ Southern Air, G Block, Albert Part Barracks, Melbourne,&lt;ref&gt;http://naa16.naa.gov.au/rs_images/ShowImage.php?B=3083715&amp;S=173&amp;T=P National Archives of Australia: B5758, 5/6/AIR PART 1, digital image p173&lt;/ref&gt; with Army Intelligence. After 1959, the files were moved to RAAF Headquarters, Support Command, Victoria Barracks, Victoria Intelligence Cell, within the main building. These case files were controlled by the [[Australian Army]] through the [[Australian Army Intelligence Corps]] staff within the Australian Intelligence system,&lt;ref&gt;See Wiki Training in Australian Army Intelligence Corps "Intelligence Corps staff work with the [[Defence Intelligence Organisation]], [[Defence Signals Directorate]] and [[Defence Security Authority]]".&lt;/ref&gt; and they played a principal role in the field investigation of any UFO phenomenon in Australia. However, the Army kept a low public profile but filtered reports for action. All departments' Central Offices were located in Melbourne, Victoria, between 1930 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Location Changes: Historical agency address --&gt; 1939-1959: Victoria Barracks, St Kilda Road, Melbourne --&gt; 1959-1961: Administrative Building, Canberra, ACT --&gt; 1961-1973: Russell Offices, Canberra, ACT - SEE End of NAA Page http://naa16.naa.gov.au/rs_images/AgencyDetail.php?M=3&amp;B=CA+35{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then due to government restructure, a majority of departments moved to Canberra. The main collection of UFO files stayed in Victoria until 1989 later going to Canberra or the National Archives of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;The NAA advise Phenomena Research Australia [PRA] that some of the UFO files could now be viewed on the net.

===The Air Force depart Australian ufology===
On 4 January 1994, RAAF Wing Commander Brett Biddington, on behalf of the Chief of Air Staff, informed every civilian UFO groups around Australia that "The number of reports made to the RAAF in the past decade had declined significantly, which may indicate that organisations such as yours are better known and are meeting the community's requirements." Therefore, the RAAF was not going to investigate or collect any more public reports from that date on. Although the RAAF have officially removed themselves from the public report collection phase, there is evidence that internal investigations, by other government departments, still continued under the new title of Unusual Aerial Phenomena (UAP) or Unusual Aerial Sightings (UAS). Called the "1996 - Defence Instructions (General) ADMIN 55-1", this 1996 Department of Defence (DOD) policy document better known as 'ADMIN 55-1' concerns UAS policy is still used.&lt;ref&gt;Air Force file AF 84 3508 Pt 1 folio 18 - RAAF POLICY: Unusual Aerial Sightings. at Enclosure 1 - National Archives of Australia (NAA) files&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;18 November 1996 House Of Reps Hansard - McLachlan, Ian, MP (Barker, Defence, LP) - Question on Notice: Question 836 - Unidentified Flying Objects -[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;page=0;query=Unidentified%20Flying%20Objects;rec=1;resCount=Default] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016225350/http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p%3Bpage%3D0%3Bquery%3DUnidentified%20Flying%20Objects%3Brec%3D1%3BresCount%3DDefault |date=16 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bergie''' is a term used for a subsection of [[homelessness|homeless]] people in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. The word originates from the [[Afrikaans]] ''berg'' meaning "mountain" – the term originally referred to the homeless people who sheltered in the forests of the slopes of [[Table Mountain]]. The synonymous term '''stroller''' typically refers to [[street children]] living a bergie lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michaelides|first1=G.G.|title=Candid Cape Town: A Discreet Guide to the Cape Peninsula|date=1977|publisher=Struik|location=Cape Town|isbn=9780869770900|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbe4AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Burchfield|editor-first=Robert|title=The Cambridge History of the English Language Volume 5: English in Britain and Overseas, Origins and Development|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521264785|page=471|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=419yI8SGcnEC|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pansegrouw|first1=Louisa|title=Pansegrouw's Crossword Dictionary|date=1994|publisher=Maskew Miller Longman|location=Cape Town|isbn=9780636019577|page=759|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eYVrCmVzrp8C|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Campaign finance in the United States''' is the financing of [[Elections in the United States|electoral campaigns]] at the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]], [[State government|state]], and [[Local government in the United States|local levels]]. At the federal level, campaign finance law is enacted by Congress and enforced by the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC), an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent federal agency]]. Although most campaign spending is privately financed, [[Political action committee|public financing]] is available for qualifying candidates for President of the United States during both the [[primary election|primaries]] and the general election. Eligibility requirements must be fulfilled to qualify for a government subsidy, and those that do accept government funding are usually subject to spending limits on money.

Races for non-federal offices are governed by state and local law. Over half the states allow some level of corporate and union contributions. Some states have limits on contributions from individuals that are lower than the national limits, while four states (Missouri, Oregon, Utah and Virginia) have no limits at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=16594|title=Contribution Limits: An Overview|author=[[National Conference of State Legislatures]]|publisher=|date=2010-01-20|accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article deals primarily with campaigns for federal office.

==Campaign Finance Numbers==
In 2008, candidates for office, [[Political parties in the United States|political parties]], and independent groups spent a total of $5.3 billion on federal elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/index.php|title=The Money Behind the Elections|publisher=|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount spent on the presidential race alone was $2.4 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15283.html|title=2008 campaign costliest in U.S. history|work=[[Politico]]|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over $1 billion of that was spent by the campaigns of the two major candidates: [[Barack Obama]] spent $730 million in his election campaign, and [[John McCain]] spent $333 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/index.php|title=Banking on Becoming President - OpenSecrets|publisher=|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount spent by Obama and McCain was a record at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dziedzic|first=Nancy|title=Election Spending|year=2012|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-7377-5434-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmqWuQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 midterm election cycle, candidates for office, political parties, and independent groups spent a total of $3.6 billion on federal elections. The average winner of a seat in the House of Representatives spent $1.4 million on his or her campaign. The average winner of a Senate seat spent  $9.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/elec_stats.php?cycle=2010|title=Election Stats|publisher=|accessdate=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The money for campaigns for federal office comes from four broad categories of sources: (1) small individual contributors (individuals who contribute $200 or less), (2) large individual contributors (individuals who contribute more than $200), (3) political action committees, and (4) self-financing (the candidate's own money). In the 2010 Congressional races, the sources of campaign contributions broke down as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/wherefrom.php?cycle=2010#|title=Where the Money Came From|publisher=|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; c/o 2k18

==Sources of Campaign Funding==

===Federal Contribution Limits===

Federal law does not allow Corporations and labor unions to donate money directly to candidates ("[[Campaign finance in the United States#Hard and soft money|hard money]]") or national party committees.  It also limits how much money (a) individuals and (b) organizations involved in political action may contribute to political campaigns, political parties, and other FEC-regulated organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121293380|title=A Century Of U.S. Campaign Finance Law|date=21 January 2010|work=NPR.org|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bundling===
One consequence of the limitation upon personal contributions from any one individual is that campaigns seek out "bundlers"—people who can gather contributions from many individuals in an organization or community and present the sum to the campaign.  Campaigns often recognize these bundlers with honorary titles and, in some cases, exclusive events featuring the candidate.

Although bundling existed in various forms since the enactment of the FECA, bundling became organized in a more structured way in the 2000s, spearheaded by the "[[Bush Pioneer]]s" for [[George W. Bush|George W. Bush's]] [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000|2000]] and [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|2004 presidential campaigns]]. During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 campaign]] the six leading primary candidates (three Democratic, three Republican) had listed a total of nearly two thousand bundlers.&lt;ref name="nyt083107b"&gt;{{cite news

===Advocacy Groups/Interest Groups===
{{main|Lobbying in the United States}}

Lobbyists often assist congressional campaign finance by arranging fundraisers, assembling PACs, and seeking donations from other clients. Many lobbyists become campaign treasurers and fundraisers for congresspersons.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Kaiser; Alice Crites (research contributor) (2007). "How lobbying became Washington's biggest business – Big money creates a new capital city. As lobbying booms, Washington and politics are transformed.". Citizen K Street [[The Washington Post]].

=== 'Hard' and 'Soft' Money ===
Contributions made directly to a specific candidate are called ''hard money'' and those made to parties and committees are called ''soft money''. Soft money constitutes an alternative form of financing campaigns that emerged in the last years. It "derives from a major loophole in federal campaign financing and spending law that exempts from regulation those contributions made for party building in general rather than for specific candidates".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political sociology : oppression, resistance, and the state|last=Deric.|first=Shannon|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=9781412980401|oclc=746832550}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no limits on soft money and some examples are donations for stickers, posters, and television and radio spots supporting a particular party platform or idea but not a concrete candidate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For the amounts of soft money contributed in recent years and the legislation that enabled this, see the section on the [[Campaign finance in the United States#Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]].

==Spending by Outside Organizations/Independent Expenditures==
Organizations other than individual candidates and their campaigns also contribute to election spending. Campaign expenditures made by groups not associated with, and independent of, a candidate's campaign are known as "independent expenditures". In addition to donating money to political campaigns (according to the limits described above), these organizations can spend money directly to influence elections.

===Political action committees===
{{main|Political action committee}}
Federal law allows for multiple types of political action committees (PACs).
* '''Connected PACs''': The [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] prohibits [[corporation]]s and [[Labor unions in the United States|labor unions]] from making direct contributions or expenditures in connection with federal elections. These organizations may, however, sponsor a "separate segregated fund" (SSF),&lt;ref name="fec.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/ssfvnonconnected.shtml|title=SSFs and Nonconnected PACs|publisher=|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as a "connected PAC". These PACs may receive and raise money only from a "restricted class", generally consisting of managers and shareholders in the case of a corporation and members in the case of a union or other interest group. In exchange, the sponsor of the PAC may absorb all the administrative costs of operating the PAC and soliciting contributions. As of January 2009, there were 1,598 registered corporate PACs, 272 related to labor unions and 995 to trade organizations.&lt;ref name=FEC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/press/press2009/20090309PACcount.shtml|title=20090309PACcount|publisher=|accessdate=13 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221753/http://www.fec.gov/press/press2009/20090309PACcount.shtml|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nonconnected PACs''': A nonconnected PAC is financially independent, meaning that it must pay for its own administrative expenses using the contributions it raises. Although an organization may financially support a nonconnected PAC, these expenditures are considered contributions to the PAC and are subject to the dollar limits and other requirements of the Act.
* '''Leadership PACs''': Elected officials and political parties cannot give more than the federal limit directly to candidates. However, they can set up a leadership PAC that makes [[independent expenditure]]s. Provided the expenditure is not coordinated with the other candidate, this type of spending is not limited.&lt;ref&gt;Kurtzleben, Danielle (September 27, 2010). [http://politics.usnews.com/news/articles/2010/09/27/demints-pac-spends-15-million-in-independent-expenditures.html "DeMint's PAC Spends $1.5 Million in Independent Expenditures"]. ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the FEC rules, leadership PACs are non-connected PACs, and can accept donations from individuals and other PACs. Since current officeholders have an easier time attracting contributions, leadership PACs are a way dominant parties can capture seats from other parties. A leadership PAC sponsored by an elected official cannot use funds to support that official's own campaign.  However, it may fund travel, administrative expenses, consultants, polling, and other non-campaign expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Center for Responsive Politics]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''"Super PACs"''': The 2010 election marked the rise of a new political committee, dubbed the "super PAC". They are officially known as "[[Independent expenditure|independent-expenditure]] only committees", because they may not make contributions to candidate campaigns or parties, but rather must do any political spending independently of the campaigns. Unlike other PACs, there is no legal limit to the funds they can raise from individuals, corporations, unions and other groups, provided they are operated correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/index.php |title=Outside Spending (2010) |publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 23, 2012, 797 super PACS had raised upwards of $349 million, with 60% of that money coming from just 100 donors, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/10/the/309086/ "The New Price of American Politics" by James Bennet] ''The Atlantic'' October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Super PACs were made possible by two judicial decisions.  First, in January 2010 the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'' that government may not prohibit unions and corporations from making independent expenditure for political purposes. Two months later, in ''[[Campaign finance evolution in 2010#SpeechNOW.org v FEC|Speechnow.org v. FEC]]'', the Federal [[Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]] held that contributions to groups that only make independent expenditures could not be limited in the size and source of contributions to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Nancy Cordes |last=Cordes |first=Nancy  |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/30/eveningnews/main20075941.shtml |title=Colbert gets a Super PAC; So what are they? |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=June 30, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent expenditures continue to grow with $17 million spent in 2002 on congressional elections, $52 million in 2006, and $290 million in 2010. In 10 states independent spending amounted to 19% of the total amount of money contributed to candidates between 2005 and 2010. In three of those states independent spending was greater than 25% of the contributions given to candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Briffault, Richard.

===501(c)(4) organizations===
{{main|501(c) organization#501(c)(4)}}

501(c)(4) organizations are defined by the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] as "social welfare" organizations. Unlike [[501(c)(3)]] charitable organizations, they may also participate in political campaigns and elections, as long as the organization's "primary purpose" is the promotion of social welfare and not political advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part7/irm_07-025-004.html#d0e332 |title=Internal Revenue Manual 501(c)(4) Nonprofit Organizations}}&lt;/ref&gt; 501(c)(4) organizations are not required to disclose their donors publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Political activity of environmental groups and their supporting foundations |url=http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&amp;FileStore_id=142d595f-411a-4057-b495-029a095fe25f |page=6 |date=September 2008 |publisher=U.

PACs and Super PACs are required by law to disclose all of their donors of over $200. However, 501(c)(4) organizations are only required to disclose their spending on political activity, and not information on their donors unless those donors give for the express purpose of political advocacy. The use of 501(c)(4) organizations for political advocacy has contributed to the sharp rise in outside spending that occurs without disclosure of donors. In 2006 just a bit more than 1% of political spending other than that done by political parties and campaign committees did not disclose donors, but by 2010 it had risen to 44%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/disclosure.php|title=Outside Spending by Disclosure, Excluding Party Committees|publisher=The Center for Responsive Politics|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of August 2012, two of the biggest 501(c)(4) groups ([[Crossroads GPS]] and [[Americans for Prosperity]]) had put more money into the presidential campaign than all the super PACs combined, according to ProPublica.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.propublica.org/article/two-dark-money-groups-outspending-all-super-pacs-combined Two Dark Money Groups Outspending All Super PACs Combined] by Kim Barker| ProPublica| Aug. 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally 501(c)(4) organizations have been civic leagues and other corporations operated exclusively for the promotion of [[social welfare]], or local associations of employees with membership limited to a designated company or people in a particular municipality or neighborhood, and with net earnings devoted exclusively to charitable, educational, or recreational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|501(c)(4)(A)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===527 organizations===
{{main|527 organization}}

A '''527 organization''' or '''527 group''' is a type of American [[tax-exempt organization]] named after "Section 527" of the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Code]]. Technically, almost all political committees, including state, local, and federal candidate committees, traditional [[political action committees]], "[[Super PACs]]", and political parties are "527s." However, in common practice the term is usually applied only to such organizations that are not regulated under state or federal campaign finance laws because they do not [[Issue advocacy ads|"expressly advocate"]] for the election or defeat of a candidate or party. When operated within the law, there are no upper limits on contributions to 527s and no restrictions on who may contribute. There are no spending limits imposed on these organizations. However, they must register with the IRS, publicly disclose their donors and file periodic reports of contributions and expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;The Center for Public Integrity, 527 Frequently Asked Questions http://projects.publicintegrity.org/527/default.aspx?act=faq#5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political parties===
Political party committees may contribute funds directly to candidates, subject to the contribution limits listed above. National and state party committees may make additional "coordinated expenditures," subject to limits, to help their nominees in general elections.  National party committees may also make unlimited "independent expenditures" to support or oppose federal candidates. However, since 2002, national parties have been prohibited from accepting any funds outside the limits established for elections in the FECA.

==Disclosure Rules==
Current campaign finance law at the federal level requires candidate committees, party committees, and PACs to file periodic reports disclosing the money they raise and spend. Federal candidate committees must identify, for example, all PACs and party committees that give them contributions, and they must provide the names, occupations, employers and addresses of all individuals who give them more than $200 in an election cycle. Additionally, they must disclose expenditures to any individual or vendor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/fecfeca.shtml#Disclosure |title=The FEC and the Federal Campaign Finance Law: Disclosure |publisher=Federal Election Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Election Commission maintains this database and publishes the information about campaigns and donors on its website. (Similar reporting requirements exist in many states for state and local candidates and for PACs and party committees.)

Various organizations, including the Center for Responsive Politics, aggregate data on political contributions to provide insight into the influence of various groups. In August 2014, a new smartphone app called "Buypartisan" was released to allow consumers to scan the barcodes of items in grocery stores and see where that corporation and its leaders directed their political contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Itkowitz|first1=Colby|title=Is your grocery bill supporting your political opponents?

==Attempts to Regulate Campaign Finance ==

===Early Attempts at Regulating Money in Campaigns ===
{{main|Campaign finance reform in the United States#History}}

=== Tillman Act of 1907 ===
Named for its sponsor, [[South Carolina]] Senator [[Ben Tillman]], the [[Tillman Act of 1907]] prohibited corporations and nationally chartered (interstate) banks from making direct financial contributions to federal candidates. However, weak enforcement mechanisms made the Act ineffective. Disclosure requirements and spending limits for [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] candidates followed in 1910 and 1911. General contribution limits were enacted in the [[Federal Corrupt Practices Act]] (1925). An amendment to the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] set an annual ceiling of $3 million for political parties' campaign expenditures and $5,000 for individual campaign contributions. The [[Smith-Connally Act]] (1943) and [[Taft-Hartley Act]] (1947) extended the corporate ban to [[Trade union|labor unions]].

===Federal Election Campaign Act (1971)===
{{main|Federal Election Campaign Act}}

In 1971, Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), instituting various campaign finance disclosure requirements for federal candidates (those running for the [[United States House of Representatives|House]], the [[United States Senate|Senate]], the President and the [[United States Vice President|Vice President]]), [[political parties]], and [[political action committees]]. In 1974, Congress passed amendments to the FECA establishing a comprehensive system of regulation and enforcement, including public financing of presidential campaigns and the creation of a central enforcement agency, the [[Federal Election Commission]]. The new regulations included limits on campaign finance, including caps on (1) individual contributions to candidates, (2) contributions to candidates by “political committees” (commonly known as Political Action Committees, or PACs), (3) total campaign expenditures, and (4) independent expenditures by individuals and groups "relative to a clearly identified candidate."

=== ''Buckley v. Valeo (1976)'' ===
The [[constitutionality]] of the FECA was challenged in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'' (1976). In ''Buckley'', the Court upheld the Act's limits on individual contributions, as well as the disclosure and reporting provisions and the public financing scheme. The Court held that limitations on donations to candidates were constitutional because of the [[compelling state interest]] in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption. However, the Court also held that caps on the amount campaigns could spend and caps on independent expenditures were an unconstitutional abridgment of [[free speech]] under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].  In addition, ''Buckley'' also held that the disclosure and reporting requirements of FECA could only apply to expenditures authorized or requested by a candidate or expenditures for communications that “expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.”

===Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (2002)===
{{main|Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act}}

Under [[Federal Election Campaign Act|FECA]], corporations, unions, and individuals could contribute unlimited "nonfederal money"—also known as "[[Campaign finance in the United States#Hard and soft money|soft money]]"—to political parties for activities intended to influence state or local elections. In a series of advisory opinions between 1977 and 1995, the FEC ruled that political parties could fund "mixed-purpose" activities—including get-out-the-vote drives and generic party advertising—in part with soft money, and that parties could also use soft money to defray the costs of "legislative advocacy media advertisements," even if the ads mentioned the name of a federal candidate, so long as they did not expressly advocate the candidate's election or defeat.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n, 540 U.S. 93, 123–24 &amp; n.7 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 1996, the Supreme Court decided ''Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC'', in which the Court ruled that Congress could not restrict the total amount of "independent expenditures" made by a political party without coordination with a candidate, invalidating a FECA provision that restricted how much a political party could spend in connection with a particular candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1995/1995_95_489|title=Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. Federal Election Commission |work=Oyez |publisher=[[Chicago-Kent College of Law|IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law]] |accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these rulings, soft money effectively enabled parties and candidates to circumvent FECA's limitations on federal election [[campaign contributions]].&lt;ref&gt;McConnell, 540 U.S. at 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Congress further attempted to reform federal campaign financing with the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]]. The BCRA, sometimes called the "McCain-Feingold" Act, amended the FECA in several respects. First, it prohibited [[political party committee|national political party committees]] from soliciting or spending any soft money and prohibited state and local party committees from using soft money for activities that affect federal elections. Second, it prohibited the use of corporate and union treasury funds to pay for "electioneering communications"—broadcast or cable advertisements clearly identifying a federal candidate—within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. The law also included a [[I approve this message|"stand by your ad" provision]] requiring candidates to appear in campaign advertisements and claim responsibility for the ad (most commonly with a phrase similar to "I'm John Smith and I approve this message.")

This law was also challenged in the Supreme Court, but its core provisions were upheld by the Supreme Court in ''[[McConnell v. Federal Election Commission]]''. However, in ''McConnell'', the Court also interpreted the “electioneering communications” provisions of BCRA to exempt “nonprofit corporations that [1] were formed for the sole purpose of promoting political ideas, [2] did not engage in business activities, and [3] did not accept contributions from for-profit corporations or labor unions.” Thus, non-business, non-profit political organizations could run electioneering advertisements provided that they did not accept corporate or union donations.

Furthermore, the BCRA did not regulate "[[527 organization]]s" (named for the section of the tax code under which they operate). These nonprofit organizations are not regulated by the FEC, provided that they do not coordinate with candidates or expressly advocate for the election or defeat of a specific candidate. After the passage of the BCRA, many of the soft money-funded activities previously undertaken by political parties were taken over by various 527 groups, which funded many issue ads in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]. The heavy spending of key 527 groups to attack presidential candidates brought complaints to the Federal Elections Commission of illegal coordination between the groups and rival political campaigns. (In 2006 and 2007 the FEC fined a number of organizations, including [[MoveOn.org]] and [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]], for violations arising from the [[527 organization#2004 election controversy|2004 campaign]]. The FEC's rationale was that these groups had specifically advocated the election or defeat of candidates, thus making them subject to federal regulation and its limits on contributions to the organizations.)

The reach of the “electioneering communications” provisions of the BCRA was also limited in the 2007 Supreme Court ruling ''[[Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.]]'' In ''Wisconsin Right to Life'', the Supreme Court stated that the restrictions on “electioneering communications” applied only to advertisements that “can only reasonably be viewed as advocating or opposing a candidate.” Thus, if there was any reasonable way to view an advertisement as an “issue ad,” it would be exempt from the BCRA’s restrictions.

===''Citizens United v. FEC (2010)'' and ''SpeechNOW.org v. FEC (2010)'' ===
Campaign finance law in the United States changed drastically in the wake of two 2010 judicial opinions: the Supreme Court’s decision in ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in ''[[SpeechNow.org v. FEC]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, 2010, "[http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/speechnow_ac_opinion.pdf FEC.GOV]", last accessed Apr. 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a 2011 [[Congressional Research Service]] report, these two decisions constitute “the most fundamental changes to campaign finance law in decades.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/politics/campaign-finance-policy-recent-developments/ |title = State of Campaign Finance Policy: Recent Developments and Issues for Congress |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org |date = 2011-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Citizens United'' struck down, on free speech grounds, the limits on the ability of organizations that accepted corporate or union money from running electioneering communications. The Court reasoned that the restrictions permitted by ''Buckley'' were justified based on avoiding corruption or the appearance of corruption, and that this rationale did not apply to [[corporate donations]] to independent organizations. ''Citizens United'' overruled the 1990 case ''[[Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce]]'', in which the Supreme Court upheld the Michigan Campaign Finance Act, which prohibited corporations from using treasury money to support or oppose candidates in elections.

Two months later, a unanimous nine-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit decided ''SpeechNow'', which relied on ''Citizens United'' to hold that Congress could not limit donations to organizations that only made independent expenditures, that is, expenditures that were “uncoordinated” with a candidate’s campaign. These decisions led to the rise of “independent-expenditure only” PACs, commonly known as “Super PACs.” Super PACs, under ''Citizens United'' and ''SpeechNow'', can raise unlimited funds from individual and corporate donors and use those funds for electioneering advertisements, provided that the Super PAC does not coordinate with a candidate.

==Efforts to Strengthen Campaign Finance Laws==

===Developments after ''Buckley v. Valeo''===
In 1986, several bills were killed in the U.S. Senate by bipartisan maneuvering which did not allow the bills to come up for a vote. The bills would impose strict controls for campaign fund raising.  Later in 1988, legislative and legal setbacks on proposals designed to limiting overall campaign spending by candidates were shelved after a Republican filibuster.  In addition, a constitutional amendment to override ‘’Buckley’’ failed to get off the ground.{{Citation needed|reason=needs verification and names of bills.|date=September 2018}}

In 1994, Senate Democrats had more bills blocked by Republicans including a bill setting spending limits and authorizing partial public financing of congressional elections.  In 1996, bipartisan legislation for voluntary spending limits which rewarded those who comply, and which banned soft money, was killed by a Republican filibuster.&lt;ref name="state1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctn.state.ct.us/civics/campaign_finance/Support%20Materials/Campaign%20Finacne%20Timeline.pdf|title=CAMPAIGN FINANCE Historical Timeline|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2011-02-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724054827/http://www.ctn.state.ct.us/civics/campaign_finance/Support%20Materials/Campaign%20Finacne%20Timeline.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Reform Party|Reform Party]], founded by [[Ross Perot]], made campaign finance reform a central issue in its [[Party platform|platform]], and when Perot ran for president in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]] and [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]] he strongly argued for it. Oddly enough, most political scientists believe that campaign finance laws hindered Perot's efforts to establish the Reform Party on a permanent basis.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 1997, the McCain-Feingold bipartisan bill sought to close soft money and TV advertising expenditures but the legislation was defeated by a Republican filibuster.  Several different proposals were made in 1999 by both parties. The Campaign Integrity Act (H.R. 1867) proposed by Asa Hutchinson (R-Arkansas) put a ban on soft money and raised [[Campaign finance in the United States#Hard and soft money|hard money]] limits.  The Citizen Legislature &amp; Political ACT (H.R. 1922) sponsored by Rep. John Doolittle (R-CA) would repeal all federal freedom ACT election contribution limits and expedite and expand disclosure.  H.R. 417 Campaign Reform Act Shays-Meehan Bill, sponsored by Christopher Shays (R-CT) and Martin Meehan (D-MA), banned soft money and limited types of campaign advertising.

Campaign finance again became a major issue in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], especially with candidates for president, [[John McCain]] and [[Ralph Nader]]. Organizations in favor of campaign finance reform included many [[public interest]] groups, such as [[Common Cause]], [[Democracy 21]], the [[Campaign Legal Center]], and [[Democracy Matters]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}  Opposition came from a coalition of organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the [[Center for Competitive Politics]] (both of which argue that campaign finance reform would harm free speech) and the [[National Rifle Association]], [[National Right to Life Committee]], and other organizations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Developments after ''Citizens United''===
The [[DISCLOSE Act]] (S. 3628) was proposed in July 2010. The bill would have amended the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit foreign influence in Federal elections, prohibit government contractors from making expenditures with respect to such elections, and establish additional disclosure requirements with respect to spending in such elections.  The bill would also have imposed new donor and contribution disclosure requirements on nearly all organizations that air political ads independently of candidates or the political parties.  The legislation would require the sponsor of the ad to appear in it.  Because the law already prohibits foreign contributions (2 U.S.C. 441e) and contributions by federal contractors (2 U.S.C. 441c), and requires identifying information on all ads (2 U.S.C. 441d), Republicans were suspicious of the bill – particularly after the primary Senate sponsor, Senate Chuck Schumer (D. N.Y.) stated that the legislation was intended to have a "deterrence effect" on speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/12/AR2010051205094.html |title=DISCLOSE Act Could Deter Involvement in Elections |publisher=WashingtonPost.com |date=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats needed at least one Republican to support the measure in order to get the 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster, but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/27/disclose-act-faces-gop-fi_n_660461.html |title=DISCLOSE Act Faces GOP Filibuster In Senate |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2010-07-27|accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downwithtyranny.blogspot.com/2010/07/gop-filibuster-succeeds-in-blocking.html |title=DownWithTyranny!: GOP Filibuster Succeeds In Blocking Campaign Finance Reform |publisher=Downwithtyranny.blogspot.com |date=2010-07-28 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several groups were formed in response to Citizens United, including [[Move to Amend]], [[American Promise (organization)|American Promise]], and [[Wolf PAC]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} [[Move to Amend]] was founded in 2009, and have become one of the larger organizations working to reform Campaign Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MTA Coalition|url=https://movetoamend.org/about-us|website=Move to Amend|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, American lawyer [[Jeff Clements]], founded [[American Promise (Organization)|American Promise]], a newer organization seeking to coordinate some of the effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foskett Jr.|first1=Steven|title=Speaker in Worcester outlines move to reverse ‘Citizens United’|url=http://www.telegram.com/news/20170329/speaker-in-worcester-outlines-move-to-reverse-citizens-united|accessdate=23 June 2017|agency=Worcester Telegram}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Goal|url=http://www.americanpromise.net/our_goal|website=American Promise|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These non-profit organizations are all calling for a 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution to overturn the decision, as well as Buckley, and the underlying doctrine equating political spending with free speech. So far, 19 states have called for the amendment, either by legislative resolution or ballot initiative.

In 2011, a [[political action committee]] called [[Wolf PAC]] was formed in response to the Citizens United decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykLB0d4KNAc|title=Cenk Announces Wolf-PAC.com at Occupy Wall Street|author=[[The Young Turks]]|date=October 19, 2011|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal is to pass an [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendment]] to overturn the decision, along with substantially similar [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions such as [[Buckley v.

In September 2014, Senate Democrats attempted to campaign for a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress and the states to limit the money raised and spent in election campaigns by outside groups, candidates and others, with a special aim at corporations and similar entities spending money on elections. Such action would, according to Republicans, violate the First Amendment right to free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farm|first1=Alan|title=Senate Dems launch doomed election-season push for constitutional bar on outside groups' clout|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2014/09/08/senate-dems-in-doomed-push-to-limit-campaign-funds|publisher=AP|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public financing of campaigns==
{{See also|Campaign finance reform in the United States#Current proposals for reform}}

===Public financing of presidential campaigns===
At the federal level, public funding is limited to subsidies for presidential campaigns. This includes (1) a "matching" program for the first $250 of each individual contribution during the primary campaign, (2) financing the major parties' national nominating conventions, and (3) funding the major party nominees' general election campaigns.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/ans/answers_public_funding.shtml|title=Quick Answers: Public Funding|publisher=|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To receive subsidies in the primary, candidates must qualify by privately raising $5000 each in at least 20 states. During the primaries, in exchange for agreeing to limit his or her spending according to a statutory formula, eligible candidates receive matching payments for the first $250 of each individual contribution (up to half of the spending limit). By refusing matching funds, candidates are free to spend as much money as they can raise privately.

From the inception of this program in 1976 through 1992, almost all candidates who could qualify accepted matching funds in the primary. In 1996 Republican [[Steve Forbes]] opted out of the program. In 2000, Forbes and [[George W. Bush]] opted out.  In 2004 Bush and Democrats [[John Kerry]] and [[Howard Dean]] chose not to take matching funds in the primary.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In 2008, Democrats [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]], and Republicans [[John McCain]], [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[Mitt Romney]] and [[Ron Paul]] decided not to take primary matching funds. Republican [[Tom Tancredo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/20070910tancredoa.shtml FEC.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916131859/http://fec.gov/press/press2007/20070910tancredoa.shtml |date=2008-09-16 }}, Tancredo certification.&lt;/ref&gt; and Democrats [[Chris Dodd]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/20071126dodd.shtml FEC.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916131353/http://fec.gov/press/press2007/20071126dodd.shtml |date=2008-09-16 }}, dodd eligible.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Biden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/20071204biden.shtml |title=Biden cert |publisher=Fec.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916132650/http://fec.gov/press/press2007/20071204biden.shtml |archivedate=2008-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Edwards]] elected to take public financing.

In addition to primary matching funds, the public funding program also assists with financing the major parties' (and eligible minor parties') [[United States presidential nominating convention|presidential nominating conventions]] and funding the major party (and eligible minor party) nominees' general election campaigns. The grants for the major parties' conventions and general election nominees are adjusted each Presidential election year to account for increases in the cost of living. In 2012, each major party is entitled to $18.2 million in public funds for their conventions, and the parties' general election nominees are eligible to receive $91.2 million in public funds. If candidates accept public funds, they agree not to raise or spend private funds or to spend more than $50,000 of their personal resources.

No major party nominee turned down government funds for the general election from 1976, when the program was launched, until [[Barack Obama]] did so in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/06/obama-to-break.html |title=Obama to Break Promise, Opt Out of Public Financing for General Election |publisher=Blogs.abcnews.com |date=2008-06-19 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama again declined government funds for the 2012 campaign, as did Republican nominee [[Mitt Romney]], setting up the only election since the program's launch in which neither major party nominee accepted federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salant|first=Jonathan D.|title=Romney Shunning Federal Funds in Post-Watergate Election|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-26/romney-shunning-federal-funds-in-post-watergate-election.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=26 April 2012|date=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eligibility of minor parties for public funds is based on showing in previous elections. The only party other than the Republicans and Democrats to receive government funding in a general election was the Reform Party, which qualified for public funding in 1996 and 2000 on the basis of Ross Perot's strong showing in the 1992 and 1996 elections.

The presidential public financing system is funded by a [[Presidential election campaign fund checkoff|$3 tax check-off]] on individual tax returns (the check off does not increase the filer's taxes, but merely directs $3 of the government's general fund to the presidential fund).  The number of taxpayers who use the check off has fallen steadily since the early 1980s, until by 2006 fewer than 8 percent of taxpayers were directing money to the fund, leaving the fund chronically short of cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-04-17-preztax_N.htm?csp=34)|title=Taxpayers elect not to pay for campaigns - USATODAY.com|publisher=|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public financing at the state and local level===
A small number of states and cities have started to use broader programs for public financing of campaigns. One method, which its supporters call [[Clean Elections|Clean Money, Clean Elections]], gives each candidate who chooses to participate a fixed amount of money. To qualify for this subsidy, the candidates must collect a specified number of signatures and small (usually $5) contributions. The candidates are not allowed to accept outside donations or to use their own personal money if they receive this public funding. Candidates who choose to raise money privately rather than accept the government subsidy are subject to significant administrative burdens and legal restrictions, with the result that most candidates accept the subsidy. This procedure has been in place in races for all statewide and legislative offices in [[Arizona]] and [[Maine]] since 2000, where a majority of officials were elected without spending any private contributions on their campaigns. [[Connecticut]] passed a Clean Elections law in 2005, along with the cities of [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].

A 2003 study by GAO found, "It is too soon to determine the extent to which the goals of Maine’s and Arizona’s public financing programs are being met."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=gao&amp;docid=f:d03453.pdf |title=GAO-03-543 Campaign Finance Reform: Early Experiences of Two States That Offer Full Public Funding for Political Candidates |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update-inline|date=June 2018}}

The "Clean Elections" movement had several defeats in the 2000s and 2010s. [[California Proposition 89 (2006)|Proposition 89]], a [[California ballot proposition]] in November 2006, sponsored by the California Nurses Union, that would have provided for public financing of political campaigns and strict contribution limits on corporations, was defeated. In 2008, the non-partisan California Fair Elections Act passed the legislature and Governor Schwarzenegger signed it, but the law did not take effect unless approved by voters in a referendum in 2010. In June 2010, voters soundly rejected the measure, 57% to 43%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_15,_Public_Funding_of_Some_Elections_(June_2010)|title=California Proposition 15, Public Funding of Some Elections (June 2010)|publisher=|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposal to implement Clean Elections in Alaska was voted down by a two-to-one margin in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/election/story/506632.html Anchorage Daily News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102221321/http://www.adn.com/election/story/506632.html |date=2009-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a pilot program in New Jersey was terminated in 2008 amid concern about its constitutionality and that the law was ineffective in accomplishing its goals. In 2010, Portland voters used a referendum to repeal the clean elections law, originally enacted by the city council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lwvpdx.org/issues-and-advocacy/campaign-finance-reform |title=Campaign Finance Reform |accessdate=2013-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514125415/http://lwvpdx.org/issues-and-advocacy/campaign-finance-reform |archivedate=2013-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, in ''[[Randall v. Sorrell]]'', the Supreme Court held that large parts of Vermont's Clean Elections law were unconstitutional. In 2008, the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Davis v. Federal Election Commission]]'' suggested that a key part of most Clean Election laws—a provision granting extra money (or "rescue funds") to participating candidates who are being outspent by non-participating candidates—is unconstitutional. In 2011, in ''Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett'', the Supreme Court struck down the matching funds provision of Arizona's law on First Amendment grounds.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-238.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Massachusetts has had a hybrid public funding system for statewide offices since 1978.  Taxpayers are allowed to contribute $1 to the statewide election fund by checking a box on their annual income taxes.  Candidates who agree to spending limits are eligible for money from this fund.  Non-participating candidates are required to estimate spending, and this will raise the limit for participating opponents if higher than the agreed-to limit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbur.org/news/2018/06/09/public-financing-mass-governor State Funding Program Unlikely To Make Dent In Governor's Race]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of finance on the results ==

A 2016 experimental study in the ''[[American Journal of Political Science]]'' found that politicians made themselves more available for meetings with individuals when they believed that the individuals had donated to their campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalla|first=Joshua L.|last2=Broockman|first2=David E.|date=2016-07-01|title=Campaign Contributions Facilitate Access to Congressional Officials: A Randomized Field Experiment|journal=American Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=60|issue=3|pages=545–558|doi=10.1111/ajps.12180|issn=1540-5907}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 study found that "even after controlling for past contracts and other factors, companies that contributed more money to federal candidates subsequently received more contracts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witko|first=C.|date=2011-10-01|title=Campaign Contributions, Access, and Government Contracting|url=https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article-abstract/21/4/761/955742/Campaign-Contributions-Access-and-Government|journal=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=761–778|doi=10.1093/jopart/mur005|issn=1053-1858}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study in the ''Journal of Politics'' found that industries overseen by committees decreased their contributions to congresspeople who recently departed from the committees and that they immediately increase their contributions to new members of the committees, which is "evidence that corporations and business PACs use donations to acquire immediate access and favor—suggesting they at least anticipate that the donations will influence policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=Eleanor Neff|last2=Grimmer|first2=Justin|date=2016-08-03|title=Money in Exile: Campaign Contributions and Committee Access|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=78|issue=4|pages=974–988|doi=10.1086/686615|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by University of Chicago political scientist Anthony Fowler and Northwestern University political scientists Haritz Garro and Jörg L.

The [[Center for Responsive Politics]] reported that "Candidates with most financial support generally win."  They supported this with the following:&lt;ref name="crp2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balcerzak|first1=Ashley|title=Where the money came from, not how much, mattered in the presidential race|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2016/11/where-the-money-came-from-not-how-much-mattered-in-the-presidential-race/|website=OpenSecrets.org|publisher=Center for Responsive Politics|accessdate=2017-02-21|date=November 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They noted, however, that the presidential race appeared to be an exception to the rule that the candidate spending the most money won.&lt;ref name="crp2016"/&gt; Analyses such as that by the [[Center for Responsive Politics]] fail to measure causality ([[correlation does not imply causation]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/freakonomics-a-rogue-economist-explores-the-hidden-side-of-everything/oclc/57207630|title=Freakonomics: a rogue economist explores the hidden side of everything|last=Levitt|first=Steven D|last2=Dubner|first2=Stephen J|date=2005|publisher=William Morrow|isbn=978-0060731328|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than financial support increasing candidates' chances of winning, it may be that better candidates attract more financial support.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Donor characteristics==
A 2017 study found that "only a small portion of Americans make campaign donations" and that both Democratic and Republican donors "are more ideologically extreme than other partisans, including primary voters. With respect to why individuals contribute, we show that donors appear responsive to their perception of the stakes in the election."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Seth J.|last2=Huber|first2=Gregory A.|date=2017-03-01|title=Representativeness and Motivations of the Contemporary Donorate: Results from Merged Survey and Administrative Records|journal=Political Behavior|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=3–29|doi=10.1007/s11109-016-9343-y|issn=0190-9320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another 2017 study found that relatively unpopular industries provide larger contributions to candidates. The authors of the study argue that this is because candidates lose voter support when they are associated with unpopular industries and that the industries therefore provide larger contributions to compensate for this loss of support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bassetti|first=Thomas|last2=Pavesi|first2=Filippo|title=Electoral Contributions and the Cost of Unpopularity|journal=Economic Inquiry|volume=55|issue=4|language=en|pages=1771–1791|doi=10.1111/ecin.12461|issn=1465-7295|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caning''' is a form of [[corporal punishment]] consisting of a number of hits (known as "strokes" or "cuts") with a single [[Stick-fighting|cane]] usually made of [[rattan]], generally applied to the offender's bare or clothed [[buttock]]s (see [[spanking]]) or [[hand]](s) (on the palm). Caning on the [[knuckle]]s or [[shoulder]]s is much less common. Caning can also be applied to the soles of the feet ([[foot whipping]] or bastinado). The size and flexibility of the cane and the mode of application, as well as the number of the strokes, vary greatly — from a couple of light strokes with a small cane across the seat of a junior schoolboy's trousers, to 24 very hard, wounding cuts on the bare buttocks with a large, heavy, soaked rattan as a judicial punishment in some [[Southeast Asia]]n countries.

The thin cane generally used for corporal punishment is not to be confused with a [[walking stick]], sometimes also called a ''cane'' (especially in American English), but which is thicker and much more rigid, and more likely to be made of stronger wood than of [[Arundo|cane]].

==Scope of use==
Caning was a common form of judicial [[punishment]] and official school discipline in many parts of the world in the 19th and 20th centuries. [[Corporal punishment]] (with a cane or any other implement) has now been outlawed in much, but not all, of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.corpun.com/counuks.htm |title= Corporal Punishment in British schools |author=C. Farrell |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, caning remains legal in numerous other countries in home, school, religious, judicial or military contexts, and is also in common use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Caning Students, still! |work =[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |location=Dhaka |url= http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=181350 |date=11 April 2011 |accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some countries where it is no longer legal.

Judicial caning, administered with a long, heavy [[rattan]] and much more severe than the canings given in [[school]]s, was/is a feature of some [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Colonialism|colonial]] judicial systems, though the cane was never used judicially in Britain itself (the specified implements there, until abolition in 1948, being the birch and the cat-o'-nine-tails). In some countries caning is still in use in the post-independence era, particularly in [[Southeast Asia]] (where it is now being used far more than it was under British rule), and in some [[Africa]]n countries.

The practice is retained, for male offenders only, under the criminal law in [[Caning in Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Caning in Brunei|Brunei]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/singfeat.htm Judicial caning in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei] at World Corporal Punishment Research.&lt;/ref&gt; (In Malaysia there is also a separate system of religious courts for Muslims only, which can order a much milder form of caning for women as well as men.) Caning in [[Indonesia]] is a recent introduction, in the special case of [[Aceh]], on Sumatra, which since its 2005 autonomy has introduced [[Islamic criminal law in Aceh|a form of sharia law]] for Muslims only (male or female), applying the cane to the clothed upper back of the offender.&lt;ref&gt;Afrida, Nani. [http://www.corpun.com/idj00506.htm#16043 "Public canings to start in Aceh for gamblers"], ''The Jakarta Post'', 23 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

African countries still using judicial caning include [[Botswana]], [[Tanzania]], [[Nigeria]] (mostly in northern states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/world/africa/nigeria-uses-law-and-whip-to-sanitize-gays.html |title= Nigeria Tries to 'Sanitize' Itself of Gays |newspaper= The New York Times |date= 8 February 2014 |author= Nossiter, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt; but few cases have been reported in southern states&lt;ref&gt;Article 18 of the Criminal Code ACt 1916; Article 386(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.corpun.com/rules2.htm#ngj |title= Nigeria: Judicial CP |publisher =World Corporal Punishment Research |date= November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Man, 25, gets 12 strokes for stealing |url= http://www.corpun.com/ngj00807.htm#20445 |newspaper= The Tide |location=Port Harcourt |date= 31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.corpun.com/11archive/ngj01108.htm#23417 |title= Court orders that undergraduate be flogged for theft |author= Anofochi, Valerie |newspaper= The Daily Times |location= Lagos |date= 3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and, for juvenile offenders only, [[Swaziland]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. Other countries that used it until the late 20th century, generally only for male offenders, included [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and [[South Africa]], while some [[Caribbean]] countries such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]] use [[birching]], another punishment in the British tradition, involving the use of a bundle of branches, not a single cane.

In Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei, healthy males under 50 years of age can be sentenced to a maximum of 24 strokes of the ''rotan'' ([[rattan]]) cane on the bare buttocks; the punishment is mandatory for many offences, mostly violent or drug crimes, but also immigration violations, sexual offences and (in Singapore) acts of [[vandalism]]. It is also imposed for certain breaches of [[prison]] rules. In [[Aceh]] caning can be imposed for adultery.&lt;ref&gt;Bachelard, Michael (7 May 2014). [http://www.theage.com.au/world/aceh-woman-gangraped-by-vigilantes-for-alleged-adultery-now-to-be-flogged-20140507-zr5x3.html "Aceh woman, gang-raped by vigilantes for alleged adultery, now to be flogged".] The Age (Melbourne).&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment is applied to foreigners and locals alike.

Two examples of the caning of foreigners which received worldwide media scrutiny are the canings in Singapore in 1994 of [[Michael P. Fay]], an American student who had vandalised several automobiles, and in the [[United Arab Emirates]] in 1996 of [[Sarah Balabagan]], a [[Filipina]] maid convicted of [[homicide]].

Caning is also used in the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] to punish serious offences against military discipline, especially in the case of recalcitrant young conscripts. Unlike judicial caning, this punishment is delivered to the soldier's clothed buttocks. See [[Caning in Singapore#Military caning]].

===School corporal punishment===
{{Main|School corporal punishment}}
The frequency and severity of canings in educational settings have varied greatly, often being determined by the written rules or unwritten traditions of the school. The western educational use of the cane dates principally to the late nineteenth century, gradually replacing [[birching]]—effective only if applied to the bare bottom—with a form of punishment more suited to contemporary sensibilities, once it had been discovered that a flexible rattan cane can provide the offender with a substantial degree of pain even when delivered through a layer of clothing.

Caning as a school punishment is strongly associated in the English-speaking world with England, but it was also used in other European countries in earlier times, notably Scandinavia, Germany and the countries of the former Austrian empire.

In some schools [[physical punishment|corporal punishment]] was administered solely by the [[headmaster]], while in others the task was delegated to other teachers. In many English and Commonwealth private schools, authority to punish was also traditionally given to certain senior students (often called [[prefect]]s). In the early 20th century, such permission for prefects to cane other boys was widespread in British [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public schools]]. The perceived advantages of this were promptness of punishment and avoiding bothering the teaching staff with minor disciplinary matters. Canings from prefects took place for a wide variety of failings, including lack of enthusiasm in sport, with the punishment repeated, if necessary, until the younger boy's performance or attitude improved.&lt;ref name=GamesAndSports&gt;{{cite book |last=Savage |first=Howard James |title=Games and sports in British schools and universities |publisher=The Chicago foundation for the advancement of teaching |location =New York |year=1927 |page=43 |oclc=531804}}&lt;/ref&gt; From at least the late 19th century onwards, prefects had also used canings to enforce youngsters' participation in other character-building aspects of public school life, such as compulsory cold baths in winter.&lt;ref name=Beerbohm&gt;{{cite book |title=Max Beerbohm in perspective |last=Lynch |first=Bohun |page=5 |publisher= Knopf |location =New York |year=1922 |oclc=975960 |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030735164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claimed advantage was that boys who misbehaved would be chastised more effectively by receiving a caning from a prefect than from a teacher, because pupils associate more closely with each other than with teachers, and thus the impact would be better known in the culprit's immediate peergroup.&lt;ref name=NationalAndEnglish&gt;{{cite journal |work=National and English Review |volume=5 |year=1885 |page=719 |issn=0952-6447 |location =London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such systems were not limited to secondary age pupils. From at least the early 1860s onwards, some private [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory schools]] relied heavily on "self-government" by prefects for even their youngest pupils (around eight years old), with caning the standard punishment for even minor offences. It was regarded as having "no sense of indignity" for the recipient of the punishment.&lt;ref name=EducationOutlook&gt;{{cite journal |work=The Education outlook |pages=31–32 |publisher=S. Birch |location =London |oclc=291230258 |year=1906 |volume=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 1920s, the tradition of prefects at British public schools repeatedly caning new boys for trivial offences was criticised by psychologists as producing "a high state of nervous excitement" in some of the youngsters subjected to it. It was felt that granting untrained and unsupervised older adolescents the power to impose comprehensive thrashings on their younger schoolmates whenever they chose might have adverse psychological effects.&lt;ref name=MentalScience&gt;{{cite journal |work=The Journal of mental science |volume=68 |year=1922 |publisher= Churchill |location =London |issn=0368-315X |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some British private schools still permitted caning to be administered by prefects in the 1960s, with opportunities for it provided by complex sets of rules on school uniform and behaviour.&lt;ref name=TheListener&gt;{{cite news |work=The Listener |location =London |volume=111 |publisher=[[BBC]] |year=1984 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, when the question was raised in Parliament, it was thought that relatively few schools still permitted this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.corpun.com/uksc6902.htm#23007 |first=Sara |last=Payne |title=Rods in young hands |work =Times Educational Supplement |location =London |date =14 February 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, caning in British [[state schools]] in the later 20th century was often, in theory at least, administered by the head teacher only. Canings for [[primary school]] age pupils at state schools in this period could be extremely rare; one study found that over an eight-year timespan, one head teacher had only caned two boys in total, but made more frequent use of [[Slippering (punishment)|slippering]], while another had caned no pupils at all.&lt;ref name=BestOfPrimaryEducation&gt;{{cite book |title=The Best of Primary Education?: A sociological study of junior middle schools |last=King |first=Ronald |page=53 |publisher=Falmer |location =London |year =1989 |isbn= 978-1-85000-602-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like their British counterparts, South African private schools also gave prefects free rein to administer canings whenever they felt it appropriate, from at least the late 19th century onwards.&lt;ref name="Boys2Gentlemen"&gt;{{cite book |title=From Boys to Gentlemen: Settler masculinity in Colonial Natal, 1880-1920 |last=Morrell |first=Robert |publisher=Unisa Press |location =Pretoria |year=2001 |page=65 |isbn= 978-1-86888-151-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; South African schools continued to use the cane to emphasise sporting priorities well into the late 20th century, caning boys for commonplace gameplay errors such as being caught [[Offside (association football)|offside]] in an [[association football]] match, as well as for poor batting performance in [[cricket]], not applauding their school team's performance sufficiently, missing sport practice sessions, or even "to build up team spirit".&lt;ref name=EducationNewNation&gt;{{cite book |last= Holdstock |first=T. Len |title= Education for a new nation |publisher= Africa Transpersonal Association |location=Riverclub |year=1987 |page=172 |isbn= 978-0-620-11721-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of corporal punishment within the school setting was prohibited by the South African Schools Act of 1996. According to Chapter 2 Section 10 of the act, ''(1) No person may administer corporal punishment at a school to a learner'' and ''(2) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a sentence, which could be imposed for assault.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acts.co.za/ed_sasa/index.htm South African Schools Act, 1996, Chapter 2 : Learners, Section 10. Prohibition of corporal punishment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707062052/http://www.acts.co.za/ed_sasa/index.htm |date=7 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many state [[secondary schools]] in England and Wales it was in use, mostly for boys, until 1987,&lt;ref name=bbcheadsfight&gt;{{cite news |title=Sparing the rod |work =The Guardian |location =London |author= Gould, Mark |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=18 May 2011 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jan/09/schools.uk1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while elsewhere other implements prevailed, such as the Scottish [[tawse]]. The cane was generally administered in a formal ceremony to the [[buttocks|seat of the trousers]], typically with the student bending over a desk or chair. Usually there was a maximum of six strokes (known as "six of the best"). Such a caning would typically leave the offender with uncomfortable weals and bruises lasting for many days after the immediate intense pain had worn off. A headmaster's caning of a 13-year-old schoolboy at an English grammar school in 1987—five strokes for poor exam results—left "severe bruising", and, according to the family doctor, five separate weals. The headmaster who gave the punishment was cleared of the offence of [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]], with the judge commenting "If you get a beating you must expect it to be with force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Caning storm head is cleared |url= http://www.corpun.com/uksc8707.htm |work =[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |location =London |last =Deves |first =Keith |date=21 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schoolgirls were caned much more rarely than boys, and if the punishment was given by a male teacher, nearly always on the palm of the hand. Rarely, girls were caned on the clothed bottom, in which case the punishment would probably be applied by a female teacher.

Caning as a school punishment for boys is still routine in a number of former British territories  [[Caning in Singapore#School caning|including Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.corpun.com/usscr2c.htm#singapore Singapore school handbooks] at World Corporal Punishment Research.&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia and Zimbabwe.

The cane was also used more or less frequently on boy inmates at the British youth reformatories known from 1933 to 1970 as [[Approved School]]s, and rarely for girls in such schools. In Approved schools the cane was applied to the buttocks for boys and to the hands for girls, but after Approved Schools became "Community Homes with Education" under the Children and Young Persons Act 1969,&lt;ref&gt;Langan, Mary. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hee8LJJuNGIC&amp;dq=%22community+homes+with+education%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Welfare: needs, rights, and risks''],  Routledge, London, 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-415-18128-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; girls could be caned on the buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Healy, Pat |url= http://www.corpun.com/ukre8105.htm |title= Caning of girls 'worse than in last century' |work=The Times |location =London |date=20 May 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caning is still used in the equivalent institutions in some countries, such as [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Guyana]].

In 19th-century France it was dubbed "The English Vice", probably because of its widespread use in British schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gibson, Ian |title= The English vice: Beating, sex, and shame in Victorian England and after |publisher=Duckworth |location=London |year=1978 |isbn=0-7156-1264-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regular depiction of caning in British novels about school life from the 19th century onwards, as well as movies such as ''[[If....]]'', which includes a dramatic scene of boys caned by prefects, contributed to the French perception of caning as being central to the British educational system.&lt;ref name=FrenchMinds&gt;{{cite journal |work=[[Blackwood's Magazine]] |year=1980 |volume=328 |publisher=William Blackwood |location =Edinburgh |issn=0006-436X |page=522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caning was not unknown for French boys in the 19th century, but they were described as "extremely sensitive" to corporal punishment and tended to make a fuss about its imposition.&lt;ref name=Hope&gt;{{cite book |title=A book of boyhoods |last=Hope |first=Ascott Robert |year=1882 |page=154 |publisher=J. Hogg |location =London |oclc=559876116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Member states of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] are obliged to "take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse."

===Domestic corporal punishment===
Also known as [[Corporal punishment in the home|domestic corporal punishment]], parents can cane a child as a punishment for disobedience, which is a common practice in some Asian countries such as Singapore, China, Malaysia, and others. See [[Caning in Singapore#Parental caning|Caning in Singapore]].

==Effects==
Caning with a heavy judicial rattan as used in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei can leave scars for years if a large number of strokes are inflicted. However, most ordinary canings with a typical light rattan (used at home for punishing children or at school for punishing students), although painful at the time, leave only reddish welts or bruises lasting a few days. [[Charles Chenevix Trench]] was caned as a boy at [[Winchester College]] in the early 1930s and later said that "it was, of course, disagreeable, but left no permanent scars on my personality or my person".&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |location= London |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1448007/Charles-Chenevix-Trench.html |title= Charles Chenevix Trench |date=29 November 2003 |accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When caning was widespread in schools in the United Kingdom, it was perceived that a caning on the hand carried a greater risk of injury than a caning on the buttocks; in 1935 an [[Exeter]] schoolboy won £1 in damages ({{Inflation|UK|1.00|1935|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}), plus his medical expenses, from a schoolmaster, when the [[county court]] decided that an [[abscess]] that developed on his hand was the result of a caning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Richer for caning|date=15 June 1935 |accessdate=23 July 2014 |work=[[Gloucester Citizen]] |url= http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000325/19350615/114/0011 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8481">A '''Certified California Municipal Treasurer''' ('''CCMT''') is a [[post-nominal]] [[professional certification]] awarded by the [[California Municipal Treasurers Association]] (CMTA) to [[California]] public treasurers who meet standards of [[education]], [[experience]] and a stated commitment to a [[code of ethics]].  It was created in 1978 to provide a professional standard of financial expertise and ethics in California government treasury.  

It provides a framework for municipal treasurers in improving performance through [[continuing education]] and become valued administrators in [[local government]].  A CCMT is a [[professional]] [[treasurer]] who is qualified to meet the challenges of a job that is becoming more and more complex in the environment of [[public finance]].

==Service provided by CCMTs ==
A [[professional certification]] provides a degree of confidence that practitioners are adequately trained, educated and experienced to be prepared for financial challenges in the real world.  [[Education]], [[experience]] and [[ethics]] requirements serve as a standard for the [[profession]].  Those who have received the Certified California Municipal Treasurer (CCMT) have subjected themselves to review of their educational and experience.  

Whereas in the [[private sector]], revenue generation and collection, [[banking]] and [[debt]] management are important to [[management]] and [[stockholders]], in the [[public sector]] there is an element of safeguarding the public trust that is added.

==CCMT Requirements ==
CCMT [[candidates]] must meet or exceed requirements in two areas; 50% educational standards and 50% experience and training requirements. Certification is also designed as a guide for municipal treasurers to become valued administrators in local government. 

[[Education]] Requirement: College or University degrees at Bachelor level in Public Administration, Accounting, Finance or related field or satisfactory completion of a course of education approved by CMTA – ½ point per instruction hour.  

Professional [[Experience]] and [[Training]] Requirement equivalent to employment as a Municipal Treasurer for 12.5 years, financial administrative position in local government or in [[corporate]] or [[Privately-held company|private]] business for 25 years or a combination of several factors including board service on state and national treasury boards.  Current active participation in CMTA is required.

CCMTs must be recertified every four years. Recertification is accomplished by a combination of treasury experience and a minimum of 40 hours of [[continuing education]].

==Unique Requirements of Public Sector Treasury==
The Office of the Treasurer is the only office in the Treasury Department that is older than the Department itself, as it was originally created by the [[Continental Congress]] in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;US Treasury website [http://www.treas.gov/offices/treasurer/office-history.shtml History of the Treasurer's Office] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508215131/http://www.treas.gov/offices/treasurer/office-history.shtml# |date=2007-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Hillegas]] served as the first Treasurer of the United States&lt;ref&gt;US Treasury website: [http://www.treas.gov/education/history/treasurers/ Treasurers of the United States] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727104026/http://www.treas.gov/education/history/treasurers/ |date=July 27, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the [[American Revolution]] until Congress [[s:United States Statutes at Large/Volume 1/1st Congress/1st Session/Chapter 12|created]] the Department of the Treasury on September 2, 1789 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ustreas.gov/education/fact-sheets/history/act-congress.html U.S. Treasury - Fact Sheet on the Act of Congress Establishing the Treasury Department] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022195350/http://www.ustreas.gov/education/fact-sheets/history/act-congress.html |date=2008-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Steven Mnuchin]] is currently the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]].

[[Bill Lockyer]] is the [[Treasurer]] of the [[State of California]].  There are 480 California cities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/cities.html State of California, Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428195928/http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/cities.html |date=2012-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 58 [[California counties]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/counties.html State of California, Counties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527094654/http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/counties.html |date=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 3,400 [[Special district (United States)|special districts]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterplan.water.ca.gov/docs/cwpu2005/vol4/vol4-background-whatssospecialaboutspecialdistricts.pdf A Citizen's Guide to Special Districts in California]&lt;/ref&gt; and school districts, each with independent fiscal stewardship.  Many City Treasurers are elected, and are therefore directly accountable to their constituents; the remainder are appointed either by [[City Council]] or [[City Manager]].   

Public treasurers are primarily responsible for managing the [[revenue]] and [[cash flow]] of a [[government agency]]. This officer is also responsible for banking, collections of user fees such as utility usage and business licenses, and communicating financial performance and forecasts to the community.  The title may vary, such as finance director, chief financial officer or CFO, from agency to agency.  

Treasury has multiple constituencies, with a responsibility to [[citizens]], [[taxpayers]] and [[voters]] to deliver informed stewardship in the investment of public funds ([[taxes]]). Additionally, treasury reporting must fund internal programs and fulfill budgetary requirements meeting expectations of  governing city councils and boards of directors within approved financial [[policy]] guidelines.

==Responsibilities of Public Treasury==
According to Benjamin Finkelstein, “On Main Street, political risk entails all the bad things that can happen to elected officials and their appointees when they take risks – even reasonable risks – with taxpayer money and come up short.” &lt;ref&gt;The Politics of Public Fund Investing, How to Modify Wall Street to Fit Main Street, Ben Finkelstein, 2006, Simon &amp; Schuster Touchstone, {{ISBN|978-0-7432-6729-8}}, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The municipal treasurer does not have the public’s permission to put public funds [[Principal sum|principal]] at [[risk]], no matter how great the potential [[Yield (finance)|yield]].  [[Securities]] options, therefore, are limited by [[statute]] to the safest portion of the investment continuum.  Public Treasury statutes mandate a priority of [[safety]] (first), [[liquidity]] (secondarily) and yield (last).&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.onecle.com/california/government/53601.html California Government Code Section 53601]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since there is an inverse relationship between [[risk]] and [[rate of return]], the potential return is limited by the risk that public funds are permitted to take.

==California Government Investment Environment==
The [[Objective (goal)|objective]] of municipal investments is to enhance the [[economic]] status of a given agency consistent with the prudent [[Security (finance)|protection]] of the agency’s investments.  Agencies are required to create a publicly reviewed [[investment policy]], prepared in conformance with all pertinent existing [[laws]] of the State of California including California Government [[Code]] Sections 53600, et seq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.onecle.com/california/government/53601.html California Government Code Section 53600-53609]&lt;/ref&gt;  This section of California Government Code defines permitted and prohibited investments.  California public treasurers must abide within the limits of this code.

'''''Delivering as One''''' is a [[United Nations]] report established by the then [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] in 2005 on the topics of development assistance, [[humanitarian aid]] and environmental issues. The panel issued its report in November 2006, and sets out a program of reform of the UN's development operations. It focuses on four main principles: One Leader, One Budget, One Programme and One Office.&lt;ref name="AutoHV-1"&gt;http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=7&lt;/ref&gt; This effort is mostly led by the [[United Nations Development Group]], a group of 32 [[United Nations]] specialised agencies working on [[International Development]] issues.&lt;REF name="AutoHV-1"/&gt; As a result, countries&amp;nbsp;— both Government and UN partners&amp;nbsp;— have undertaken efforts to work together more effectively and efficiently. Eight countries—Albania, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Pakistan, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uruguay, and Viet Nam—volunteered to be pilots for the initiative.

The '''''Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund''''' (English: '''German Nationalist Protection and Defiance Federation'''&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian. ''Hitler: 1889-1936: Hubris'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;) was the largest, most active, and most influential [[anti-Semitic]] federation in Germany after the [[First World War]],&lt;ref name=one&gt;Beurteilung des Reichskommissars für Überwachung der öffentlichen Ordnung in einem Schreiben an den Staatsgerichtshof zum Schutze der Republik, 20 November 1922, quoted from Lohalm 1970, pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the largest and most important organizations of the German [[völkisch movement|''völkisch'' movement]] during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1918-1933), whose democratic-parliamentary system it unilaterally rejected. Its publishing arm put out some of the books that greatly influenced the opinions of those who later organized the [[Nazi Party]], such as [[Heinrich Himmler]],&lt;ref name=himmler&gt;[[Peter Padfield|Padfield, Peter]]. ''Himmler: Reichsführer SS''. New York: Henry Holt, 1990. p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; and after the Bund folded ({{circa}} 1924) many of its members eventually joined the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;
Kershaw, Ian. ''Hitler: 1889-1936: Hubris''. New York: Norton (1998)
&lt;/ref&gt;
The Schutz- und Trutzbund used as its symbols a blue cornflower and a swastika, and according to Peter Padfield its motto was ''"Wir sind die Herren der Welt!"'' ("We are the masters of the world!").&lt;ref name=himmler /&gt; Not a single German source can be found which confirms this motto, which in fact is a verse from the song "''Der mächtigste König im Luftrevier''" (i.e. The mightiest king in the skies.)

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The ''Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund'' was originally called the ''Deutscher Schutz- und Trutzbund'' when it was founded in February 1919 in [[Bamberg]] for the purpose of "fighting" [[Judaism]], during a meeting of the ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]'' ("All-German League"). The director of ''Deutschen Schutz- und Trutzbund'' was [[Alfred Roth]], and its secret chairman was [[Konstantin von Gebsattel]], appointed on 1 October 1919 by [[Ernst von Hertzberg Lottin]]. Their Advisory Board included, among others, Ernst Anton Franz von Bodelschwingh, August Gebhard, Paul Lucius, Ferdinand Werner, [[Julius Friedrich Lehmann]], and Georg von Stössel. Their meeting place was originally in [[Duisburg]], at Alfred Roth's house, but was later moved to [[Hamburg]] where it joined the amalgamation of several such other organizations. It merged with the ''[[Reichshammerbund]]'', and then, about one month later, merged with the ''[[Deutschvölkischen Bund]]'', the organization that succeeded the ''[[Deutschvölkische Party]]''.&lt;ref name=two&gt;Werner Jochmann: ''Nationalsozialismus und Revolution : Ursprung und Geschichte der NSDAP in Hamburg 1922 - 1933. Dokumente.'' Europäische Verlagsanstalt, Hamburg 1963, pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manifesto==
The manifesto of the ''Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund'' was ''Wenn ich der Kaiser wär'', written by [[Heinrich Claß]], in which he expressed identitarian, nationalist views. His slogan was: "Germany for the Germans." &lt;ref name= three&gt;Ulrich Sieg, Deutschlands Prophet. [[Paul de Lagarde]] und die Ursprünge des modernen Antisemitismus, München 2007, pg. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Friedrich Lehmann]], a [[Munich]] publisher, helped promote their ideas, and in October 1918, Claß called for a [[coup d'etat]]. The organization agitated against the [[Weimar Republic]]; by 1923 it had just under 180,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_44476&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitution==

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Bund fights for the moral rebirth of the German people . . .

'''Director of Security of the Defense Establishment''' or just '''Ministry of Defense Security Authority''', '''Malmab''' ({{lang-he|הממונה על הביטחון במשרד הביטחון}}, ''Ha-Memune al ha-bitahon be-Misrad Ha-Bitahon'') is a department in the [[Israeli Defense Ministry]] that responsible for the security of the Defense Ministry, Israeli weapons industries and institutions in dealing with development and production of [[weapons of mass destruction]] and defensive centers such, the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]], [[Israel Institute for Biological Research]] and military units engaged in these areas.

The Malmab was established in 1958, under the leadership of Haim Kermun, former [[Shin Bet]] officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=15 March 2005 |title=המלמ"ב הראשון |language=he |trans-title=The First Malmab |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/health/1.952542 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tha Malmab investigate the function of the workers, security audits, certification of the exposure technology, corruption and preventing leakage of classified information.

The Malmab is operating also as Intelligence Agency—as the Malmab is operate activate agents that responsible for dealing with obtaining technological information and intelligence in foreign countries. This area was the responsibility of [[Lekem|Science Affairs Bureau]], but in 1986, after the [[Jonathan Pollard|Pollard affair]], the Lekem powers were transferred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5708">'''Erich Goode''' is an [[United States|American]] [[sociologist]] specializing in the [[sociology of deviance]]. He has written a number of books on the field in general, as well as on specific deviant topics.
He is a professor at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]].

==Biography==
Goode received a B.A. from [[Oberlin College]] (1960) and a Ph.D. in [[sociology]] from [[Columbia University]] (1966). He has taught at Columbia University, [[New York University]], [[Florida Atlantic University]], the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], and [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem, Israel. He is currently employed as a professor at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]]. He also teaches at the University of Maryland.

Goode takes a [[Social constructionism|constructionist]] approach to deviance. In his view, a behavior is deviant if and only if society at large considers it so. The broader social factors that go into the classification of a behavior as deviant are thus considered a valid subject of study. His research focuses on the deviant individuals (and behaviors) themselves, as well as the particular individuals and groups that play a part in classifying the behavior as deviant. 

As a sociologist, Goode makes no judgment about whether a particular is "bad" or "evil", and considers deviance as a topic to be entirely dependent on whether the society at large considers the behavior deviant. In this view, a particular behavior can be deviant in one society, but normal in another. This is in contrast to the perspective of [[essentialism]], which would say that a behavior either "really is" deviant or "really isn't", and that it is the task of the sociologist to discover and report on the truth of the matter, and what society at large believes is mostly irrelevant.

According to the constructionist framework as espoused by Goode, an instance of "deviance" can exist as a social construct exclusively, completely separate from any actual behavior. In other words, "imaginary deviance" can exist that causes a frenzy of interesting sociological behavior in response to a non-existence phenomenon. [[Satanic ritual abuse]] is an example of this in modern times, and the case of [[witch hunts]] is an example from antiquity. These are often called [[moral panic]]s, and Goode considers them a valid subject (perhaps the ideal subject) for deviance studies.

Erich Goode is known for his exploration and exposure of the "[[moral panic]]" concept. He takes a "harm reductionist" approach to studying social deviance. This commitment aims to reduce social harm without engaging in value judgments or essentialist claims about those being studied.

==Goode's Four Types of Drug Use==
1. Legal instrumental use - Taking prescribed drugs and over the counter drugs to relieve or treat symptoms. 

2. Legal recreational use - Using legal (tobacco, alcohol, caffeine) drugs to achieve a certain mental state. 

3. Illegal instrumental use - Taking non prescription drugs to accomplish a task or goal. 

4.Illegal recreational use - Taking illegal drugs for fun or pleasure to experience euphoria.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Glen R., Peter J. Venturelli, and Annette E. Fleckenstein. Drugs and Society. 9th ed. Sudbury: Jones and Bartlett, 2006. 19. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==

In ''[http://www.druglibrary.org/special/goode/mjsmokers.htm The Marijuana Smokers]'' (1971), Goode looked at marijuana through a sociological lens.

In ''Drugs in American Society'', Goode argued that the effect of a drug is dependent on the societal context in which it is taken. Thus, in one society (or social context) a particular drug may be a depressant, and in another it may be a stimulant.

''Deviant Behavior'' is a textbook intended for undergrad students. In it, Goode takes the position of a weak constructionist.

''Moral Panics: The Social Construction of Deviance'', written with [[Nachman Ben-Yehuda]], is a book about moral panics, from a sociological perspective. 

In ''Paranormal Beliefs: A Sociological Introduction'' (1999), Goode studies paranormal beliefs such as [[UFOs]], [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], and [[creationism]] using the methods of the sociology of deviance. Consistent in tone with the rest of his works, he takes the position that whether the phenomenon in question is real is not important to a sociologist. Rather, sociologists should be concerned with how the paranormalist is labeled as deviant, and what effect the label has on them and society.

==Controversy==

As a sociologist, Goode relies heavily on informants for his research. For example, Goode consulted with and interviewed actual drug users for his books on drugs. In 1999, Goode admitted through the sociology journal circuit that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with many of his deviant informants, and discussed how this influenced his perspective on the subject he was studying. This caused a firestorm of articles defending or denouncing his work.&lt;ref name=sex_with_informants&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goode|first=Erich|title=sex with informants as deviant behavior: an account and commentary|journal=Deviant Behavior|date=October 1999|volume=20|issue=4|pages=301–324 http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/udbh/1999/00000020/00000004/art00001]|doi=10.1080/016396299266416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fatherland Front''' ('''OF''') [''Otečestven Front''] ({{lang-bg|Отечествен фронт, ОФ}}) was originally a [[Bulgaria]]n political [[resistance movement]] during [[World War II]]. The [[Zveno]] movement, the communist Bulgarian Workers Party, a wing of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] and the [[Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party (Broad Socialists)|Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party]], were all part of the OF. The constituent groups of the OF had widely contrasting ideologies and had only united in face of the pro-German, militarist dictatorship in Bulgaria. Still, initially the members of the OF worked together, without a single dominating group. Professional associations and unions could be members of the front, whilst still maintaining their organisational independence. However, the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] began to dominate soon. In 1944, after the [[Soviet Union]] had declared war on Bulgaria, the OF committed a [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944|coup d'état]] and they declared war on Germany and the other [[Axis Powers|Axis]] nations. The OF government, headed by [[Kimon Georgiev]] (Zveno), immediately signed a [[ceasefire]] treaty with the Soviet Union.

On November 18, 1945, it won a large majority after being the only party or alliance listed on the ballot.&lt;ref name=Jessup&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jessup |first1=John E. |title=A Chronology of Conflict and Resolution, 1945-1985  |year=1989  |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=New York  |isbn=0-313-24308-5  |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 Georgiev resigned and his successor was [[Georgi Dimitrov]], leader of the Communist Party, and Bulgaria became a [[People's Republic]].  It eventually transformed into a wide-ranging [[popular front]] under overall Communist control, and all member parties except the [[Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union]] dissolved. With the [[End of Communism in Bulgaria (1989)|end of Communism]] in 1989 it was dissolved. One of the former Chairmen of the National Council was [[Encho Staikov]]. [[Pencho Kubadinski]] was Chairman of the National Council 1974&amp;ndash;1989.

The [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] may also issue a special warrant which allows the government to spend funds without an appropriation from Parliament. A special warrant may only be issued when money is "urgently needed" after Parliament has been dissolved and until sixty days after the dates set for the return of [[writ of election|election writs]].

Until 1997, when an act sponsored by [[Peter Milliken]] received Royal Assent, special warrants were available whenever Parliament was not is session, including adjournments and [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogation]]s.

{{Campaignbox Herero Wars}}
{{Scramble for Africa}}
The '''Herero Wars''' were a series of colonial wars between the [[German Empire]] and the [[Herero people]] of [[German South West Africa]] (present-day [[Namibia]]).

==Background==
The Hereros were cattle grazers, occupying most of central and northern South West Africa.

During the [[Scramble for Africa]], South West Africa was claimed by Germany in August 1884. At that time, it was the only overseas German territory deemed suitable for white settlement. German colonists arriving in the following years occupied large areas of land, ignoring any claims by the Herero, Namaqua, and other natives. There was continual resistance by the natives.

A sort of peace was worked out in 1894{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}. In that year, [[Theodor Leutwein]] became the colony's governor. White settlers were further encouraged and took more land from the natives. That caused a great deal of discontent.

==Rebellion==
In 1903, some of the Khoi and Herero tribes rose in revolt and about 60 German settlers were killed. Troops were sent from Germany to re-establish order but only dispersed the rebels, led by Chief [[Samuel Maharero]]. In a famous letter to [[Hendrik Witbooi (Namaqua chief)|Hendrik Witbooi]], the [[Nama people|Namaqua]] chief, Maharero sought to organize his rebellion against the Germans while building alliances with the other tribes, exclaiming ''Let us die fighting!''&lt;ref&gt;Gewald, Jan-Bart, Herero Heroes: A Socio-political History of the Herero of Namibia, 1890-1923, London: James Curry Ltd (1999), ISBN 082557493, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;
The Herero led a guerrilla campaign, conducting fast hit and run operations then melting back into the terrain they knew well, preventing the Germans from gaining an advantage with their modern artillery and machine-guns. However a conclusive battle was fought on August 11, 1904 at the [[Battle of Waterberg]] in the [[Waterberg Mountains]]. Chief Maharero believed his six to one advantage over the Germans would allow him to win in a final showdown. The Germans had time to bring forward their artillery and heavy weapons. Both sides took heavy losses, but the Herero were scattered and defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=African Kaiser |chapter=7: Hereroland |publisher=Penguin |author=Robert Gaudi |year=2017 |page= |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1904, General [[Lothar von Trotha]] issued orders to kill every male Herero and drive women and children into the desert. As soon as the news of this order reached Germany, it was repealed,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} but Trotha initially ignored Berlin. When the extermination order was finally suspended at the end of 1904, surviving tribesmen were herded into [[concentration camps]], while others were transferred as [[slave labor]] to German businesses; many Herero died of overwork and malnutrition.

It took the Germans until 1908 to re-establish authority over the territory. By that time tens of thousands of Africans estimates range from 34,000 to 110,000 had been either killed&lt;ref name=sarkin&gt;Jeremy Sarkin-Hughes (2008) ''Colonial Genocide and Reparations Claims in the 21st Century: The Socio-Legal Context of Claims under International Law by the Herero against Germany for Genocide in Namibia, 1904-1908'', p. 142, Praeger Security International, Westport, Conn. {{ISBN|978-0-31336-256-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moses&gt;A.

At the height of the campaign some 19,000 German troops were involved.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

At about the same time, [[diamond]]s were discovered in the territory, which briefly greatly boosted its prosperity.{{importance inline}}

==Aftermath==
In 1915, during World War I, British and [[South Africa]]n forces occupied it in the so-called [[South West Africa Campaign]], and SW Africa later{{when|date=July 2017}} became a protectorate of South Africa.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

On 16 August 2004, 100 years after the war, the German government officially apologized for the atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/world/africa/germany-genocide-namibia-holocaust.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news Namibia holocaust]&lt;/ref&gt; "We Germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by Germans at that time," said [[Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul]], Germany's development aid minister. In addition, she admitted that the massacres were equivalent to [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/germany/article/0,2763,1283864,00.html "German minister says sorry for genocide in Namibia"] (15 August 2004) ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Not until 2015 did the German government admit that the massacres were equivalent to [[genocide]] and again apologized in 2016. The Herero are suing the German government in a class action lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Schult und Christoph Titz [http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/voelkermord-nachkommen-der-herero-und-nama-verklagen-deutschland-a-1128885.html Herero und Nama verklagen Deutschland] Der Spiegel, 06.01.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
The Herero Wars and the massacres are both depicted in a chapter of the 1963 novel ''[[V.]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]]. The tragic story of the Herero and Namaqua Genocide also appears in Pynchon's 1973 novel ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]''.

The heavy toll of the Herero and Namaqua Genocide on individual lives and the fabric of Herero culture is seen in the 2013 historical novel ''Mama Namibia'' by Mari Serebrov.&lt;ref&gt;Serebrov, Mari (2013) ''Mama Namibia''. Windhoek, Namibia: Wordweaver Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;

The war and the massacres are both significantly featured in ''The Glamour Of Prospecting'',&lt;ref name="glamourP"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/glamourprospect00corngoog | title=The Glamour Of Prospecting: Wanderings Of A South African Prospector In Search Of Copper, Gold, Emeralds, and Diamonds | publisher=London, T.F.

In the book he describes his first hand accounts of witnessing the concentration camp on Shark Island amongst other aspects of the conflict.

The '''inauguration of Willem-Alexander''' as the new monarch of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] took place on 30 April 2013. [[Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] announced on 28 January 2013 that she would abdicate in favor of her eldest son, [[Willem-Alexander]]. He is the first King of the Netherlands since the death of his great-great-grandfather King [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] in 1890.

==Abdication of Queen Beatrix==
On 28 January 2013, three days before her 75th birthday, Queen Beatrix announced on a televised speech that she would abdicate, ending a reign of 33 years. Abdication is not uncommon in Dutch royalty. Both Queen [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Juliana]], her mother, and Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]], her grandmother, have abdicated.

On 30 April 2013 at 10:07 AM, Queen Beatrix signed the Instrument of Abdication, making Willem-Alexander the monarch even before the investiture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12103">[[Image:Decenica.jpg|thumb|The Decemviri and Nicadori, along with Codreanu, were exhumed and given a lavish burial service in November 1940.]]
During the 1930s, '''three notable [[death squad]]s''' emerged from [[Romania]]'s [[Iron Guard]]: the '''Nicadori''', the '''Decemviri''' and the '''Răzbunători'''. Motivated by a combination of [[fascist]] political ideology and religious-nationalist mysticism, they carried out several high-level political assassinations in the inter-war period.

==Theoretical background==
Death was a central part of the Iron Guard's ideology. Its members, known as Legionnaires, were officially asked "to embrace death" if needed; in practice, they were supposed to be ready to both ''give'' and ''embrace'' death&amp;mdash;in other words, to be willing to assassinate their political enemies at the risk of their own life. This "Legionnaire's death" was widely celebrated. For instance, the second verse of the hymn used by the Guard's youth wing is:

{| width="100%"
|- valign="top" 
|
Moartea, numai moartea legionară&lt;br&gt;
Ne este cea mai scumpă nuntă dintre nunţi,&lt;br&gt;
Pentru sfânta cruce, pentru ţară&lt;br&gt;
Înfrângem codrii şi supunem munţi;&lt;br&gt;
Nu-i temniţă să ne-nspăimânte,&lt;br&gt;
Nici chin, nici viforul duşman;&lt;br&gt;
De cădem cu toţi, izbiţi în frunte,&lt;br&gt;
Ni-i dragă moartea pentru Căpitan!
|
Death, only a Legionnaire's death&lt;br&gt;
Is our dearest wedding of weddings,&lt;br&gt;
For the Holy Cross, for the country&lt;br&gt;
We defeat forests and conquer mountains;&lt;br&gt;
No prison can frighten us,&lt;br&gt;
Nor any torture, or enemy storm;&lt;br&gt;
If we all fall, hit in the forehead,&lt;br&gt;
Death for the [[Corneliu Codreanu|Captain]] is dear to us!
|
|}
{{Fascism in Romania}}

The Guard aligned itself with the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], which prohibits murder. However, it had ways of justifying the notion of "giving death" (a notion its founder, [[Corneliu Codreanu]], never fully explained, as he was given to laconic pronouncements).&lt;ref name="Petreu, p. 42"&gt;Petreu, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Codreanu noted that, given the opposition the Guard faced from the state, other political parties, and the media, the Legionnaires had made "the decision to embrace death. The 'death squad' is the expression of this determination, shared by all Legionnaires in the country. It means that these youths are willing to ''accept death''. They are willing to move forward, through death". He suggested that in pursuing their goal, "a new Romania and the long awaited revival of this Romanian nation, the aim of all our efforts, struggle, and sacrifice", the Legionnaires were ready to sacrifice themselves, to become martyrs for their country.&lt;ref name="Petreu, p. 42"/&gt;

It was during the Legionnaire-dominated Students' Congress of April 3–5, 1936, held at [[Târgu Mureș]], that the death squads were officially established. However, writing in ''The Nest Leader's Manual'', which appeared in May 1933, Codreanu taught: "A Legionnaire loves death, for his blood shall cement the future Legionary Romania". In 1927, at the Guard's very creation, its members swore to be "strong by severing all ties connecting us with mundane things&amp;nbsp;... by serving the cause of the Romanian nation and the cause of the Cross". By claiming to renounce material wealth and invoking the [[Christian cross|Cross]], the Legionnaires were channeling [[Christ]]: they believed they would die for the nation as he had died to redeem mankind. [[Vasile Marin]], who made important contributions to Legionnaire doctrine, amplified on this notion when he praised the Nicadori in 1934: "Three young students have committed an act in the service of a great cause. You all know what that act was. Their sacrifice was inspired by a great idea. It was done in the name of a great idea. They performed this act, and now they are paying the price".&lt;ref&gt;Petreu, pp. 42-3&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Legionnaires, the murder of a political enemy or a traitorous comrade meant sacrificing oneself for a greater cause: the Christian religion, one of mercy, was thus transformed into an ideology of murder. They drew inspiration from Codreanu himself, who had planned a large number of political assassinations with [[Ion Moța]], and who had killed a policeman in [[Iași]] in autumn 1924. At his trial for that deed he proclaimed, "it was my faith and my love of this country that guided me in this struggle, in everything I did. We pledge to fight until the end". He was acquitted, as was Moţa (who shot Vernichescu, the man who revealed the assassination conspiracy, seven times, albeit not fatally); both were acclaimed as heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Petreu, pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

As assassinations rendered their perpetrators heroes, they became a sought-after activity for Legionnaires, and Codreanu further enticed them: "The day after the victory of the Legionnaires we shall convene an &lt;small&gt;EXTRAORDINARY TRIBUNAL&lt;/small&gt; called upon to judge, for ''high treason'':&amp;nbsp;... all those who, in defiance of the laws of this country, persecuted, imprisoned, or otherwise caused harm to the Legionnaires and to their families&amp;nbsp;... no one shall escape judgment". Codreanu's former deputy [[Mihai Stelescu]], after leaving the Legion, publicly accused Codreanu of sacrificing young men for the advancement of his own career, and of devising a type of murder based on "manipulation of the masses", using others as assassins and leaving them to face justice.&lt;ref name="Petreu, p. 44"&gt;Petreu, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Legionnaires were animated by the idea that the nation included both the dead and the living, with its heroes providing assistance to the latter when invoked. This element of their ideology involved an authentic mystique of the idea of dying for one's nation, as those killed in the course of their duties automatically became heroes who could continue to support their living comrades' undertakings. This enthusiasm for death motivated Moţa, who went to [[Spain]] to die for Romania so that (as he believed) his country would be redeemed in God's eyes, as well as in the death-exalting literature produced by that segment of the intellectual élite which had proved receptive to Legionary ideas: [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Radu Gyr]], [[Constantin Noica]], and others.&lt;ref name="Petreu, p. 44"/&gt;

The Legionnaire's death was amply practiced. Many gave their lives certain that the movement and the national cause would be strengthened; they never hesitated to kill in the name of the same idea. Aside from the three cases discussed below, Iron Guard members were responsible for the [[Jilava Massacre]] at the eponymous prison on the night of November 26-27, 1940, when 64 political prisoners, 46 officers and guards, and a number of military detainees were killed; the murder of [[Nicolae Iorga]] and [[Virgil Madgearu]] that same night; other killings during the [[National Legionary State]]; and the deaths of hundreds of officers, civilians, and Bucharest Jews during the [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom]].&lt;ref&gt;Petreu, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicadori==
[[File:Nicadorii.jpg|thumb|The Nicadori on trial]]
The Nicadori assassinated [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Ion G. Duca]] at [[Sinaia train station]] at 10 pm on December 30, 1933. This was the first major political assassination in Romania since [[Barbu Catargiu]] was shot in 1862. The Nicadori killed Duca because he had arrested thousands of Legionnaires during the [[Romanian general election, 1933|1933 election campaign]], also leaving 18 dead; and because he had allowed for increased Jewish immigration while blocking that of [[Aromanians]] to [[Dobrudja]]. Their name was derived from the first letters of the group members' names:

*'''Ni'''colae Constantinescu, who fired the four fatal shots, was a student at the Commerce Academy in Bucharest.
*Ion '''Ca'''ranica, an Aromanian, was born in 1903 in [[Veria]]. He studied commerce in [[Thessaloniki]] and then Bucharest. He joined the Iron Guard in 1930, and fought for Aromanian rights.
*'''Dor'''u Belimace, also an Aromanian, was born in 1910 in [[Malovišta]], near [[Bitola]]. His family settled in Bucharest after [[World War I]]. He graduated from the [[University of Bucharest]]'s Faculty of Letters; he attended its Faculty of Law at the same time but did not finish.

Arrested right away, the trio was sentenced to hard labour for life. While in prison, Caranica wrote a book on Aromanian issues, and Belimace, among other works, wrote ''Revoluţia fascistă'' ("The Fascist Revolution"). They were killed, along with the Decemviri and Codreanu, on November 30, 1938, while being transported to [[Jilava]] prison.

==Decemviri==
The Decemviri, so called because they numbered ten men, like their [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] equivalents, the [[Decemviri]], shot [[Mihai Stelescu]] in his hospital bed between 38 and about 200 times on July 16, 1936. After shooting him, they cut him into pieces with axes and danced around the body of the victim. Four of those involved in Stelescu's execution were theology students. Stelescu had left the Iron Guard, forming the rival [[Crusade of Romanianism]], and launching a series of public attacks against Codreanu. Codreanu could not abide this betrayal, although both he and the assassins (rather implausibly) denied he knew about the plan or had consented to it.

Ion Caratănase led the squad; its other members were Iosif Bozântan, Ştefan Curcă, Ion Pele, Grigore Ion State, Ion Atanasiu, Gavrilă Bogdan, Radu Vlad, Ştefan Georgescu and Ion Trandafir. Arrested immediately, the men were sentenced to hard labour for life. They were killed, along with the Nicadori and Codreanu, on November 30, 1938, while being transported to Jilava prison.

==Răzbunători==
Răzbunătorii &amp;ndash; "the Avengers" &amp;ndash; assassinated Prime Minister [[Armand Călinescu]] on September 21, 1939. Călinescu had been Minister of the Interior at the time of Codreanu's death, and thus had some connection with it. A few months after Codreanu was killed, [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol]]'s police uncovered a plot to exact revenge on Călinescu. Carol retaliated by ordering members of the Iron Guard rounded up and put to death without trial. The exact number executed was never known; estimates were as high as six thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, nine young Legionnaires ambushed Călinescu while he was on his way to work. They were:

*Miti Dumitrescu (Codreanu's trial lawyer)
*Ion Ionescu (student)
*Ovidiu Isaia (photographer)
*Ion Moldoveanu (student)
*Gheorghe Paraschivescu (student)
*Cezar Popescu (student)
*Marin Stănciulescu (mechanic)
*Traian Popescu (student)
*Ion Vasiliu (draftsman).

They fired over twenty bullets into his body, also killing his driver and wounding his bodyguard. The assailants were caught shortly before midnight on the day of the attack. On King Carol's orders, they were taken to the spot where they had killed the premier. Huge floodlights from army trucks illuminated the area so that the assembled crowd could watch as the nine men were shot in the head with their own guns. The
bodies were left under the lights for days. Above them was a large banner reading: ''De acum înainte, aceasta va fi soarta trădătorilor de ţară'' ("From now on, this shall be the fate of those who betray the country"). Soldiers and police were given a free hand to deal with any and all suspected members of the Iron Guard, and thousands of young men were shot, hanged from [[telegraph]] poles, or tortured to death. A few hundred escaped to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Frantz, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The possibility of a [[Jew]]ish homeland in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] had been a goal of [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations since the late 19th century. The [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] stated in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.&lt;ref&gt;[[M. E. Yapp|Yapp, M.E.]] (1987). ''The Making of the Modern Near East 1792–1923''. Harlow, England: Longman. p. 290. {{ISBN|0-582-49380-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After [[World War I]], the [[United Kingdom]] was given a [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] for Palestine, which it had conquered from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] during the war. In 1937 the [[Peel Commission]] suggested [[Two-state solution|partitioning Mandate Palestine]] into an Arab state and a Jewish state, though the proposal was rejected as unworkable by the government and was at least partially to blame for the renewal of the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936–39 Arab revolt]].

[[File:UN Partition Plan For Palestine 1947.png|thumb|upright|left|The UN partition plan]]
In the face of increasing violence after [[World War II]], the British handed the issue over to the recently established [[United Nations]]. The result was [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181|Resolution 181(II)]], a plan to partition Palestine into ''Independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem''. The Jewish state was to receive around 56% of the land area of Mandate Palestine, encompassing 82% of the Jewish population, though it would be separated from Jerusalem. The plan was accepted by most of the Jewish population, but rejected by much of the Arab populace. On 29 November 1947, the resolution to recommend ''to the United Kingdom, as the mandatory Power for Palestine, and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation, with regard to the future government of Palestine, of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union'' was put to a vote in the United Nations General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7f0af2bd897689b785256c330061d253 UNITED NATIONS General Assembly: A/RES/181(II): 29 November 1947: Resolution 181 (II): ''Future government of Palestine'': Retrieved 26 April 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524094913/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7f0af2bd897689b785256c330061d253 |date=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The result was 33 to 13 in favour of the resolution, with 10 abstentions. Resolution 181(II): ''PART I: Future constitution and government of Palestine: A. TERMINATION OF MANDATE, PARTITION AND INDEPENDENCE: Clause 3'' provides:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem, ... shall come into existence in Palestine two months after the evacuation of the armed forces of the mandatory Power has been completed but in any case not later than 1 October 1948''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Arab countries (all of which had opposed the plan) proposed to query the [[International Court of Justice]] on the competence of the General Assembly to partition a country, but the resolution was rejected.

===Drafting the text===
The first draft of the declaration was made by [[Zvi Berenson]], the [[Histadrut]] trade union's legal advisor and later a Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]], at the request of [[Pinchas Rosen]]. A revised second draft was made by three lawyers, A. Beham, A. Hintzheimer and Z.E. Baker, and was framed by a committee including [[David Remez]], [[Pinchas Rosen]], [[Haim-Moshe Shapira]], [[Moshe Sharett]] and [[Aharon Zisling]].&lt;ref name="Shelley" /&gt; A second committee meeting, which included [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Yehuda Leib Maimon]], Sharett and Zisling produced the final text.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, J. (1998) [http://jtr.lib.virginia.edu/the-israeli-declaration-of-independence-a-camel-is-a-horse-produced-by-a-committee/ The Israeli Declaration of Independence] ''The Journal of the Society for Textual Reasoning'', Vol. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minhelet HaAm Vote===
On 12 May 1948, the [[Minhelet HaAm]] ({{lang-he|מנהלת העם}}, lit. ''People's Administration'') was convened to vote on declaring independence.&lt;ref&gt;Tuvia Friling, S. Ilan Troen (1998) "Proclaiming Independence: Five Days in May from Ben-Gurion's Diary" [[Israel Studies]], 3.1, pp. 170–194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Maoz, Ben D. Mor (2002) ''Bound by Struggle: The Strategic Evolution of Enduring International Rivalries'', University of Michigan Press, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the thirteen members were missing, with [[Yehuda Leib Maimon]] and [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]] being blocked in [[Battle for Jerusalem (1948)|besieged]] [[Jerusalem]], while [[Yitzhak-Meir Levin]] was in the United States.

The meeting started at 1:45 in the afternoon and ended after midnight. The decision was between accepting the American proposal for a truce, or declaring independence. The latter option was put to a vote, with six of the ten members present supporting it:
*'''For''': [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Moshe Sharett]] ([[Mapai]]); [[Peretz Bernstein]] ([[General Zionists]]); [[Haim-Moshe Shapira]] ([[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]); [[Mordechai Bentov]], [[Aharon Zisling]] ([[Mapam]]).
*'''Against''': [[Eliezer Kaplan]], [[David Remez]] (Mapai); [[Pinchas Rosen]] ([[New Aliyah Party]]); [[Bechor-Shalom Sheetrit]] ([[Sephardim and Oriental Communities]]).

[[Chaim Weizmann]], the Chairman of the [[World Zionist Organization]],{{efn|name=a}} and soon to be [[List of Presidents of Israel|first]] [[President of Israel]], endorsed the decision, after reportedly asking "What are they waiting for, the idiots?"&lt;ref name="Shelley" /&gt;

===Final wording===
The draft text was submitted for approval to a meeting of [[Provisional State Council|Moetzet HaAm]] ({{lang-he|מועצת העם}}, lit. ''People's Council'') at the [[Jewish National Fund|JNF]] building in [[Tel Aviv]] on 14 May. The meeting started at 13:50 and ended at 15:00, an hour before the declaration was due to be made, and despite ongoing disagreements, with a unanimous vote in favour of the final text. During the process, there were two major debates, centering on the issues of borders and religion. 

====Borders====
{{see also|Borders of Israel}}
[[File:Letter from Eliahu Epstein to Harry S. Truman, May 14, 1948.jpg|thumb|left|On the day of its proclamation, [[Eliahu Epstein]] wrote to [[Harry S. Truman]] that the state had been proclaimed "within the frontiers approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its Resolution of November 29, 1947".]]
The borders were not specified in the Declaration. However, its 14th paragraph included a commitment to implement the UN Partition Plan:
&lt;blockquote&gt;THE STATE OF ISRAEL is prepared to cooperate with the agencies and representatives of the United Nations in implementing the resolution of the General Assembly of the 29th November, 1947&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The original draft had declared that the borders would be that decided by the UN partition plan. While this was supported by Rosen and [[Bechor-Shalom Sheetrit]], it was opposed by Ben-Gurion and Zisling, with Ben-Gurion stating, "We accepted the UN Resolution, but the Arabs did not. They are preparing to make war on us. If we defeat them and capture western Galilee or territory on both sides of the road to Jerusalem, these areas will become part of the state. Why should we obligate ourselves to accept boundaries that in any case the Arabs don't accept?"&lt;ref name="Shelley"&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/4/Shelley%20Kleiman%20-%20The%20State%20of%20Israel%20Declares%20Ind The State of Israel Declares Independence] Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of the designation of borders in the text was dropped after the provisional government of Israel, the [[Provisional government of Israel|Minhelet HaAm]], voted 5–4 against it.&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt; The [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionists]], committed to a Jewish state on both sides of the [[Jordan River]] (that is, including Trans[[jordan]]), wanted the phrase "within its historic borders" included but were unsuccessful.

====Religion====
The second major issue was over the inclusion of God in the last section of the document, with the draft using the phrase "and placing our trust in the Almighty". The two [[rabbi]]s, Shapira and [[Yehuda Leib Maimon]], argued for its inclusion, saying that it could not be omitted, with Shapira supporting the wording "God of Israel" or "the Almighty and Redeemer of Israel".&lt;ref name="Shelley" /&gt; It was strongly opposed by Zisling, a member of the secularist [[Mapam]]. In the end the phrase "[[Rock of Israel]]" was used, which could be interpreted as either referring to God, or the land of [[Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]], Ben-Gurion saying "Each of us, in his own way, believes in the 'Rock of Israel' as he conceives it. I should like to make one request: Don't let me put this phrase to a vote." Although its use was still opposed by Zisling, the phrase was accepted without a vote.

====Name====
The writers also had to decide on the name for the new state. [[Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]], Ever (from the name [[Eber]]), [[Judea]], and [[Zion]] were all suggested, as were Ziona, Ivriya and Herzliya.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, M.]] (1998) ''Israel: A History'', London: Doubleday. p. 187. {{ISBN|0-385-40401-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judea and Zion were rejected because, according to the partition plan, Jerusalem (Zion) and most of the [[Judean mountains]] would be outside the new state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 May 2008 |title=Why not Judea? Zion? State of the Hebrews? |publisher=Haaretz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/981617.html |accessdate=22 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510134718/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/981617.html |archivedate=10 May 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben-Gurion put forward "Israel" and it passed by a vote of 6–3.&lt;ref name="JPost" /&gt;  Official documents released in April 2013 by the State Archive of Israel show that days before the establishment of the State of Israel in May 1948, officials were still debating about what the new country would be called in Arabic: Palestine (Filastin), Zion (Sayoun) or Israel (Eesra’il).  Two assumptions were made: "That an Arab state was about to be established alongside the Jewish one in keeping with the UN’s partition resolution the year before, and that the Jewish state would include a large Arab minority whose feelings needed to be taken into account".  In the end, the officials rejected the name Palestine because they thought that would be the name of the new Arab state and could cause confusion so they opted for the most straightforward option: Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/leaders-grappled-over-arabic-name-for-fledgling-state/|title=Why Israel’s first leaders chose not to call the country ‘Palestine’ in Arabic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other items====
At the meeting on 14 May, several other members of Moetzet HaAm suggested additions to the document. [[Meir Vilner]] wanted it to denounce the British Mandate and military but Sharett said it was out of place. [[Meir Argov]] pushed to mention the [[Displaced Persons camp]]s in Europe and to guarantee freedom of [[language]]. Ben-Gurion agreed with the latter but noted that Hebrew should be the main language of the state.

The debate over wording did not end completely even after the Declaration had been made. Declaration signer [[Meir David Loewenstein]] later claimed, "It ignored our sole right to [[Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]], which is based on the covenant of the Lord with [[Abraham]], our father, and repeated promises in the [[Tanakh|Tanach]]. It ignored the aliya of the [[Nahmanides|Ramban]] and the students of the [[Vilna Gaon]] and the [[Baal Shem Tov|Ba'al Shem Tov]], and the [rights of] Jews who lived in the 'Old Yishuv'."&lt;ref name="EIF"&gt;[http://www.eretzisraelforever.net/Articles/Articles_ViewArticle.asp?sAction=view&amp;iArticleId=1825010290 Wallish and the Declaration of Independence] ''The Jerusalem Post'', 1998 (republished on Eretz Israel Forever)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declaration ceremony==

[[File:Declaration of State of Israel 1948.jpg|thumb|[[David Ben-Gurion]] declaring independence beneath a large portrait of [[Theodor Herzl]], founder of modern [[Zionism]]]]
The ceremony was held in the [[Independence Hall (Israel)|Tel Aviv Museum]] (today known as Independence Hall) but was not widely publicised as it was feared that the British Authorities might attempt to prevent it or that the Arab armies might invade earlier than expected. An invitation was sent out by messenger on the morning of 14 May telling recipients to arrive at 15:30 and to keep the event a secret. The event started at 16:00 (a time chosen so as not to breach the [[shabbat|sabbath]]) and was broadcast live as the first transmission of the new radio station [[Kol Yisrael]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/mfa-archive/1999/pages/shelley%20kleiman%20-%20the%20state%20of%20israel%20declares%20ind.aspx Shelley Kleiman-The State of Israel Declares Independence] Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;

The final draft of the declaration was typed at the [[Jewish National Fund]] building following its approval earlier in the day. [[Ze'ev Sherf]], who stayed at the building in order to deliver the text, had forgotten to arrange transport for himself. Ultimately, he had to flag down a passing car and ask the driver (who was driving a borrowed car without a license) to take him to the ceremony. Sherf's request was initially refused but he managed to persuade the driver to take him.&lt;ref name="Shelley"/&gt; The car was stopped by a policeman for speeding while driving across the city though a ticket was not issued after it was explained that he was delaying the declaration of independence.&lt;ref name="JPost" /&gt; Sherf arrived at the museum at 15:59.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stljewishlight.com/news/world/article_7d1c7f6e-3efb-11e2-b93a-0019bb2963f4.html "The throwback museum that echoes independence"] ''St. Louis Jewish Light'', 5 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

At 16:00, Ben-Gurion opened the ceremony by banging his [[gavel]] on the table, prompting a spontaneous rendition of [[Hatikvah]], soon to be Israel's [[national anthem]], from the 250 guests.&lt;ref name="JPost"&gt;[http://info.jpost.com/1998/Supplements/Jubilee/2.html One Day that Shook the world] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112220409/http://info.jpost.com/1998/Supplements/Jubilee/2.html |date=12 January 2012 }} ''The Jerusalem Post'', 30 April 1998, by Elli Wohlgelernter&lt;/ref&gt; On the wall behind the podium hung a picture of [[Theodor Herzl]], the founder of modern Zionism, and two flags, later to become the official [[flag of Israel]].

After telling the audience "I shall now read to you the scroll of the Establishment of the State, which has passed its first reading by the [[Jewish National Council|National Council]]", Ben-Gurion proceeded to read out the declaration, taking 16 minutes, ending with the words "Let us accept the Foundation Scroll of the Jewish State by rising" and calling on Rabbi [[Yehuda Leib Maimon|Fishman]] to recite the [[Shehecheyanu]] blessing.&lt;ref name="JPost" /&gt;

===Signatories===
[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Ben Gurion (Left) Signing the Declaration of Independence.jpg|thumb|left|Ben Gurion (Left) Signing the Declaration of Independence held by Moshe Sharet]]
As leader of the [[Yishuv]], [[David Ben-Gurion]] was the first person to sign. The declaration was due to be signed by all 37 members of [[Moetzet HaAm]]. However, twelve members could not attend, eleven of them trapped in [[Siege of Jerusalem (1948)|besieged]] [[Jerusalem]] and one abroad. The remaining 25 signatories present were called up in alphabetical order to sign, leaving spaces for those absent. Although a space was left for him between the signatures of [[Eliyahu Dobkin]] and [[Meir Vilner]], [[Zerach Warhaftig]] signed at the top of the next column, leading to speculation that Vilner's name had been left alone to isolate him, or to stress that even a communist agreed with the declaration.&lt;ref name="JPost" /&gt; However, Warhaftig later denied this, stating that a space had been left for him (as he was one of the signatories trapped in Jerusalem) where a Hebraicised form of his name would have fitted alphabetically, but he insisted on signing under his actual name so as to honour his father's memory and so moved down two spaces. He and Vilner would be the last surviving signatories, and remained close for the rest of their lives. Of the signatories, two were women ([[Golda Meir]] (Meyerson/Myerson) and [[Rachel Cohen-Kagan]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/signers.html Establishment of Israel: Signatories to the Israeli Declaration of Independence] ''[[Jewish Virtual Library]]'', 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Herzl Rosenblum]], a journalist, was called up to sign, Ben-Gurion instructed him to sign under the name Herzl Vardi, his pen name, as he wanted more Hebrew names on the document. Although Rosenblum acquiesced to Ben-Gurion's request and legally changed his name to Vardi, he later admitted to regretting not signing as Rosenblum.&lt;ref name=JPost /&gt; Several other signatories later Hebraised their names, including [[Meir Argov]] (Grabovsky), [[Peretz Bernstein]] (then Fritz Bernstein), [[Avraham Granot]] (Granovsky), [[Avraham Katznelson|Avraham Nissan]] (Katznelson), [[Moshe Kol]] (Kolodny), [[Yehuda Leib Maimon]] (Fishman), [[Golda Meir]] (Meyerson/Myerson), [[Pinchas Rosen]] (Felix Rosenblueth) and [[Moshe Sharett]] (Shertok). Other signatories added their own touches, including [[Saadia Kobashi]] who added the phrase "HaLevy", referring to the tribe of [[Levi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tam.co.il/23_4_2004/magazin11.htm For this reason we congregated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013182456/http://www.tam.co.il/23_4_2004/magazin11.htm |date=13 October 2007 }} ''Iton Tel Aviv'', 23 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

After Sharett, the last of the signatories, had put his name to paper, the audience again stood and the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]] played "Hatikvah". Ben-Gurion concluded the event with the words "The State of Israel is established! This meeting is adjourned!"&lt;ref name="JPost" /&gt;

==Context and aftermath==
{{main|1948 Palestine war}}
{{History of Israel}}
The declaration was signed in a context of [[1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|civil war between the Arab and Jewish populations of the Mandate]] that had started the day after the partition vote at the UN six months earlier. Neighbouring Arab states and the [[Arab League]] were opposed to the vote and had declared they would intervene to prevent its implementation. In a [[:s:Cablegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States to the Secretary-General of the United Nations|cablegram]] on 15 May 1948 to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States claimed that "the Arab states find themselves compelled to intervene in order to restore law and order and to check further bloodshed".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=S/745 PDF copy of Cablegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States of the 15 May 1948: Retrieved 13 December 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107030419/http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=S%2F745 |date= 7 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few days after the declaration, armies of Egypt, Trans-Jordan, Iraq, and Syria engaged Israeli troops inside the area of what had just ceased to be Mandatory Palestine, thereby starting the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. A truce began on 11 June, but fighting resumed on 8 July and stopped again on 18 July, before restarting in mid-October and finally ending on 24 July 1949 with the signing of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|armistice agreement]] with Syria. By then Israel had retained its independence and increased its land area by almost 50% compared to the 1947 UN Partition Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cragg |first=Kenneth |title=Palestine. The Prize and Price of Zion |publisher=Cassel |year=1997 |pages=57, 116 |isbn=978-0-304-70075-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the declaration, Moetzet HaAm became the [[Provisional State Council]], which acted as the legislative body for the new state until the [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|first elections]] in January 1949.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Many of the signatories would play a prominent role in [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politics]] following independence; Moshe Sharett and Golda Meir both served as Prime Minister, [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] [[Israeli presidential election, 1952|became]] the country's second [[President of Israel|president]] in 1952, and several others served as [[Cabinet of Israel|ministers]]. [[David Remez]] was the first signatory to pass away, dying in May 1951, while Meir Vilner, the youngest signatory at just 29, was the longest living, serving in the [[Knesset]] until 1990 and dying in June 2003. [[Eliyahu Berligne]], the oldest signatory at 82, died in 1959.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Eleven minutes after midnight, the United States ''de facto'' [[International recognition of Israel|recognized]] the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=83 United states de facto Regnition of State of Israel]: 14 May 1948: Retrieved 14 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by [[Shah of Iran|Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]'s Iran (which had voted against the UN partition plan), Guatemala, Iceland, Nicaragua]l, [[Communist Romania|Romania]], and Uruguay.

In the three years following the [[1948 Palestine war]], about 700,000 Jews immigrated to Israel, residing mainly along the borders and in former Arab lands.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, ''Righteous Victims'', chap. VI.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 136,000 were some of the 250,000 displaced Jews of World War II.&lt;ref name="ushmm2007"&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005462 Displaced Persons] Retrieved 29 October 2007 from the US Holocaust Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; And from the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] until the early 1970s, 800,000–1,000,000 Jews [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|left, fled, or were expelled]] from their homes in Arab countries; 260,000 of them reached Israel between 1948 and 1951; and 600,000 by 1972.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=Adi |date=4 January 2008 |title=All I Wanted was Justice |work=[[Haaretz]] |url=http://www.adi-schwartz.com/israeli-arab-conflict/all-i-wanted-was-justice/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shulewitz&gt;Malka Hillel Shulewitz, ''The Forgotten Millions: The Modern Jewish Exodus from Arab Lands'', Continuum 2001, pp. 139 and 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aharoni&gt;[[Ada Aharoni]] [http://www.hsje.org/forcedmigration.htm "The Forced Migration of Jews from Arab Countries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213230126/http://www.hsje.org/forcedmigration.htm |date=13 February 2012 }}, Historical Society of Jews from Egypt website.

At the same time, a large number of Arabs [[1948 Palestinian exodus|left, fled or were expelled]] from, what became Israel.

==Status in Israeli law==
[[File:Israel ind mus.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Independence Hall (Israel)|Independence Hall]] as it appeared in 2007]]
Paragraph 13 of the Declaration provides that the State of Israel would ''be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex;''. However, the [[Knesset]] maintains that the declaration is neither a law nor an ordinary legal document.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/megilat_eng.htm The Proclamation of Independence] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] has ruled that the guarantees were merely guiding principles, and that the declaration is not a constitutional law making a practical ruling on the upholding or nullification of various ordinances and statutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/NR/exeres/11364F53-F19B-4760-AA91-E066DDD0B29B.htm The Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel] Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 the Knesset amended two [[Basic Laws of Israel|basic laws]], [[Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty|Human Dignity and Liberty]] and Freedom of Occupation, introducing (among other changes) a statement saying "the fundamental human rights in Israel will be honored (...) in the spirit of the principles included in the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel."

==The scroll==
Although Ben-Gurion had told the audience that he was reading from the scroll of independence, he was actually reading from handwritten notes because only the bottom part of the scroll had been finished by artist and calligrapher [[Otte Wallish]] by the time of the declaration (he did not complete the entire document until June).&lt;ref name="EIF"/&gt; The scroll, which is bound together in three parts, is generally kept in the country's National Archives.

==Official translation==
Translation of the Declaration by the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
{{Quotation|The Land of Israel was the birthplace of the Jewish people. Here their spiritual, religious and political identity was shaped. Here they first attained to statehood, created cultural values of national and universal significance and gave to the world the eternal Book of Books. 
After being forcibly exiled from their land, the people kept faith with it throughout their Dispersion and never ceased to pray and hope for their return to it and for the restoration in it of their political freedom.

Impelled by this historic and traditional attachment, Jews strove in every successive generation to re-establish themselves in their ancient homeland. In recent decades they returned in their masses. Pioneers, ma'pilim [(Hebrew) - immigrants coming to Eretz-Israel in defiance of restrictive legislation] and defenders, they made deserts bloom, revived the Hebrew language, built villages and towns, and created a thriving community controlling its own economy and culture, loving peace but knowing how to defend itself, bringing the blessings of progress to all the country's inhabitants, and aspiring towards independent nationhood.

In the year 5657 (1897), at the summons of the spiritual father of the Jewish State, Theodore Herzl, the First Zionist Congress convened and proclaimed the right of the Jewish people to national rebirth in its own country.

This right was recognized in the Balfour Declaration of the 2nd November, 1917, and re-affirmed in the Mandate of the League of Nations which, in particular, gave international sanction to the historic connection between the Jewish people and Eretz-Israel and to the right of the Jewish people to rebuild its National Home.

The catastrophe which recently befell the Jewish people - the massacre of millions of Jews in Europe - was another clear demonstration of the urgency of solving the problem of its homelessness by re-establishing in Eretz-Israel the Jewish State, which would open the gates of the homeland wide to every Jew and confer upon the Jewish people the status of a fully privileged member of the comity of nations.

Survivors of the Nazi holocaust in Europe, as well as Jews from other parts of the world, continued to migrate to Eretz-Israel, undaunted by difficulties, restrictions and dangers, and never ceased to assert their right to a life of dignity, freedom and honest toil in their national homeland.

In the Second World War, the Jewish community of this country contributed its full share to the struggle of the freedom- and peace-loving nations against the forces of Nazi wickedness and, by the blood of its soldiers and its war effort, gained the right to be reckoned among the peoples who founded the United Nations.

On the 29th November, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling for the establishment of a Jewish State in Eretz-Israel; the General Assembly required the inhabitants of Eretz-Israel to take such steps as were necessary on their part for the implementation of that resolution. This recognition by the United Nations of the right of the Jewish people to establish their State is irrevocable.

This right is the natural right of the Jewish people to be masters of their own fate, like all other nations, in their own sovereign State.

ACCORDINGLY WE, MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLE'S COUNCIL, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY OF ERETZ-ISRAEL AND OF THE ZIONIST MOVEMENT, ARE HERE ASSEMBLED ON THE DAY OF THE TERMINATION OF THE BRITISH MANDATE OVER ERETZ-ISRAEL AND, BY VIRTUE OF OUR NATURAL AND HISTORIC RIGHT AND ON THE BASIS OF THE RESOLUTION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY, HEREBY DECLARE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A JEWISH STATE IN ERETZ-ISRAEL, TO BE KNOWN AS THE STATE OF ISRAEL.

WE DECLARE that, with effect from the moment of the termination of the Mandate being tonight, the eve of Sabbath, the 6th Iyar, 5708 (15th May, 1948), until the establishment of the elected, regular authorities of the State in accordance with the Constitution which shall be adopted by the Elected Constituent Assembly not later than the 1st October 1948, the People's Council shall act as a Provisional Council of State, and its executive organ, the People's Administration, shall be the Provisional Government of the Jewish State, to be called "Israel".

THE STATE OF ISRAEL will be open for Jewish immigration and for the Ingathering of the Exiles; it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.

THE STATE OF ISRAEL is prepared to cooperate with the agencies and representatives of the United Nations in implementing the resolution of the General Assembly of the 29th November, 1947, and will take steps to bring about the economic union of the whole of Eretz-Israel.

WE APPEAL to the United Nations to assist the Jewish people in the building-up of its State and to receive the State of Israel into the comity of nations.

WE APPEAL - in the very midst of the onslaught launched against us now for months - to the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the State on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions.

WE EXTEND our hand to all neighbouring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighbourliness, and appeal to them to establish bonds of cooperation and mutual help with the sovereign Jewish people settled in its own land. The State of Israel is prepared to do its share in a common effort for the advancement of the entire Middle East.

WE APPEAL to the Jewish people throughout the Diaspora to rally round the Jews of Eretz-Israel in the tasks of immigration and upbuilding and to stand by them in the great struggle for the realization of the age-old dream - the redemption of Israel.

PLACING OUR TRUST IN THE "ROCK OF ISRAEL", WE AFFIX OUR SIGNATURES TO THIS PROCLAMATION AT THIS SESSION OF THE PROVISIONAL COUNCIL OF STATE, ON THE SOIL OF THE HOMELAND, IN THE CITY OF TEL-AVIV, ON THIS SABBATH EVE, THE 5TH DAY OF IYAR, 5708 (14TH MAY,1948).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/guide/pages/declaration%20of%20establishment%20of%20state%20of%20israel.aspx Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel] Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Nihongo|'''Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform'''|新しい歴史教科書をつくる会|Atarashii Rekishi Kyōkasho o Tsukuru Kai}} is a group founded in December 1996&lt;ref&gt;Carolin Rose: ''The Battle for Hearts and Minds. Patriotic Education in Japan in the 1990s and Beyond.'' In: Naoko Shimazu (editor): ''Nationalisms in Japan''. Routledge 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; to promote a [[Japanese nationalism|nationalistic]] view of the [[History of Japan|history]] of [[Japan]].

==Productions and views==
The group was responsible for authoring a history textbook published from Fusōsha (扶桑社), which was heavily criticised by [[China]], [[South Korea]], and many Western historians for [[Whitewash (censorship)|not including full accounts]] of or downplaying Imperial [[Japanese war crimes]] during [[World War II]], such as the [[Nanjing Massacre]] (南京大虐殺) being euphemistically labelled as "Nanjing ''Incident''" (南京事件) and the policy of utilizing "[[comfort women]]" (慰安婦). 

The textbook also highlights Japan's claim to the [[Liancourt Rocks]], which Japan calls ''Takeshima'' and which South Korea calls ''Dokdo''; as well as the [[Senkaku Islands]], called Diaoyu in Chinese, which are administered by Japan and claimed by both the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]).

The Japan Policy Institute (日本政策研究センター, not to be confused with the [[Japan Policy Research Institute|JPRI]] based in [[San Francisco]]) has published a pamphlet entitled "Questionable points of Chinese and Korean textbooks" (ここがおかしい中国・韓国歴史教科書). The institute accuses neighboring Asian nations' textbooks of containing [[Anti-Japanese sentiment|anti-Japanese]] [[propaganda]], and encouraged people to compare the textbooks.

==Public reception==
The textbook, published as a trade book in Japan in June 2001, sold six hundred thousand copies by June 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.asahi.com/2004senkyo/localnews/TKY200407040200.html ] ([[Asahi Shimbun]], July 20, 2004 )&lt;/ref&gt; Despite commercial success, the book was taken up by only a handful of schools, most of which are privately run and located in a comparatively small geographic area of Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_2001_August_20/ai_78375128 0.03% of junior high students to use disputed textbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707191736/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_2001_August_20/ai_78375128 |date=2007-07-07 }} ([[Kyodo News|Kyodo]], August 20, 2001 )&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''[[Nanjing Massacre]]''':&lt;br /&gt;"In August 1937, two Japanese soldiers, one an officer, were shot to death in [[Shanghai]] (the hub of foreign interests). After this incident, the hostilities between Japan and China escalated. Japanese military officials thought [[Chiang Kai-shek]] would surrender if they captured [[Nanking]], the Nationalist capital; they occupied that city in December. *But Chiang Kai-shek had moved his capital to the remote city of Chongqing. The conflict continued. Note *At this time, many Chinese soldiers and civilians were killed or wounded by Japanese troops (the [[Nanjing Massacre|Nanking Incident]]). Documentary evidence has raised doubts about the actual number of victims claimed by the incident. The debate continues even today" (p.&amp;nbsp;49).
#'''[[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]''':&lt;br /&gt;“On July 7, 1937, shots were fired at Japanese soldiers while they were engaged in maneuvers near Marco Polo Bridge (located outside [[Beijing]]). By the next day, this incident (the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]) had escalated into hostilities with Chinese troops. The incident was of relatively small magnitude, and efforts were made to resolve it locally. But Japan decided to send a large number of troops to China when the Nationalist government issued an emergency mobilization order. These events marked the beginning of a war that lasted for eight long years" (p.&amp;nbsp;49).
#'''[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]''':&lt;br /&gt;"The war inflicted a huge amount of devastation and suffering on the peoples of Asia, where it was fought. The casualties (both military and civilian) attributable to Japanese invasions were particularly high in China. Each time the Japanese occupied a Southeast Asian nation, they set up a military administration. Leaders of local independence movements cooperated with those military administrations so that they could liberate their countries from the yoke of the Western powers. But when the Japanese insisted that local populations learn the Japanese language and worship at [[Shinto]] shrines, they met with resistance. Anti-Japanese elements who aligned themselves with the Allies engaged in [[guerrilla warfare]], which Japanese troops dealt with severely. Many people, civilians included, were killed during these confrontations. When the fortunes of war turned against Japan and food supplies ran short, the Japanese often forced the local population to do back-breaking work. After the war was over, Japan paid [[war reparations|reparations]] to those nations. Then Japan was accused of promoting the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] philosophy to justify the war and occupation of Asia. Later, after Japan was defeated and Japanese troops had withdrawn from Asia, all these former colonies achieved [[independence]] through their own efforts during the next dozen years. Some Japanese soldiers remained in Asia and participated in the various struggles for independence. The initial goal of Japan’s southward advance was to obtain resources, but it also served to spur on nascent independence movements in Asia" (p.&amp;nbsp;54)
#'''Japanese Actions Inspire the Peoples of Asia''':&lt;br /&gt;"Japanese soldiers drove out the forces of Western Europe, which had colonized the nations of Asia for many years. They surprised us, because we didn’t think we could possibly beat the white man, and they inspired us with confidence. They awakened us from our long slumber, and convinced us to make the nation of our ancestors our own nation once again. We cheered the Japanese soldiers as they marched through the [[Malay Peninsula]]. When we saw the defeated British troops fleeing, we felt an excitement we had never experienced before. (Excerpt from the writings of Raja Dato Nong Chik, leader of the Malaysian independence movement and former member of the Malaysian House of Representatives)"  (p.&amp;nbsp;54)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6216">The '''labor movement in Taiwan''' did not start until the 1980s, after the end of [[martial law in Taiwan]]. Many of these labor movements began when [[Kuomintang]] became more lenient with social movements. In addition, with the help of non-KMT political figures, such as members of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], many labor unions and State-owned enterprise administrations removed KMT's influence, and this reshaped a huge economic sector of [[Taiwan]] from being strictly controlled by the state.

== History ==

=== Prior to martial law ===
During the period of [[martial law in Taiwan]] from 1949, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) prohibited the formation of new political parties, outlawed collective action including labor strikes, and censored all media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It built Leninist-style party organizations in major factories, and state corporates and factory organizers worked together to tackle worker's subjections{{clarify|date=May 2015}}.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Ming-sho|year=2006|title=CHALLENGING STATE CORPORATISM: THE POLITICS OF TAIWAN’S LABOR FEDERATION MOVEMENT|url=http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~msho/book.files/J9.pdf|journal=The China Journal|volume=56|pages=107–127|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KMT government also executed a national industrialization policy that led to the development of many specific industries including transportation, electricity, petroleum, and telecommunications as state-owned or public companies. Labor unions were then formed to support the state and its economic plan, instead of providing a collective bargaining platform for workers in these state-own industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tai|first=Hsiao-Hui|year=2012|title=Labour Identity and Union Strategies in Taiwan: A Case Study|url=http://ilera2012.wharton.upenn.edu/RefereedPapers/TaiHsiaoHui.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 1980s when the emergence of new political forces from the new middle class emerged within [[Taiwan]], weakening the Kuomintang's strong opposition to social movements. The [[Democratic Progressive Party]] was formed in 1986, and martial law ended in 1987.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chu|first=Yin-wah|year=1996|title=Democracy and Organized Labor in Taiwan: The 1986 Transition|url=|journal=Asian Survey|volume=36|pages=495–510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the labor movements focused on issues such as overtime and annual bonuses, but then this movement turned into seizures of labor unions. Many corporates had close ties with the Kuomintang, but with the labor movements, the KMT party branches lost their privileges within these enterprises.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Post-martial law ===
In the early 1990s, labor unions began to demand that the KMT withdraw its force and influence from unions. They did so by spreading stories of party corruption, and worked with the DPP to uncover illegal activities of the KMT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Ming-sho|year=2007|title=The Rise and Fall of Leninist Control in Taiwan's Industry|url=http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~msho/book.files/J7.pdf|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=189|pages=162–189|via=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], labor disputes and unemployment issues were brought to the attention of the government, and workers began to recognize the importance of autonomous unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=James W. Y.|year=2010|title=The Political Economy of Collective Labour Legislation in Taiwan|url=https://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/jcca/article/view/303/303|journal=Journal of Current Chinese Affairs|volume=3/2010|pages=51–85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2000 election, the Kuomintang lost its position as the ruling party in both the [[Legislative Yuan]] and the executive branch. The [[Democratic Progressive Party]] introduced a bill to revise the Labor Standards Law and tried to set a legal limit of 44 working hours per week. However, after compromising with the KMT, the bill was revised to set the legal working period to 84 hours per two weeks. This law went into effect in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Chang-Ling|year=2002|title=THE POLITICS OF REREGULATION: GLOBALIZATION,DEMOCRATIZATION, AND THE TAIWANESELABOR MOVEMENT|url=|journal=The Developing Economics|volume=XL-3|pages=305–26|via=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as the first move of the DPP asserting their executive power over labor movements.

In addition to the revision of Labor Standards law, the state also revised Union law and Labor Dispute Mediation law. The organization of labor in the 1980s did not have much involvement of opposition political figures. However, workers followed their agendas and asserted their opposition to the enterprises and the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HO|first=MING-SHO|year=2003|title=Democratization and Autonomous Unionism in Taiwan: The Case of Petrochemical Workers|url=http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~msho/book.files/J20.pdf|journal=Issues &amp; Studies|volume= 39| issue =  3|pages=105–135|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the labor movement progressed, there was also an increase in disputes between workers and their employers. The number of disputed cases rose from 1609 cases in 1987 to 10955 cases in 2001. There was also an increase in union membership as the labor movement progressed. The unionization rate increased from 37.58% in 1987 to 39.40% in 2001. In addition, many state-owned enterprises privatized starting 1989, and about 30 companies privatized between 1989 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kong|first=Tat Yan|year=2006|title=Labour and Globalization: Locating the Northeast Asian Newly Industrializing Countries|url=|journal=Review of International Political Economy|volume= 13| issue =  1|pages=103–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privatization of state-owned enterprises was not because these companies faced economic pressure such as debts, but from political and macro-economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liou|first=Kuo-Tsai|year=1992|title=Privatizing State-owned Enterprises: the Taiwan Experience|url=|journal=International Review of Administrative Science|volume= 58|pages=403–419|via=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National capital== 
[[Islamabad]] officially became the capital of Pakistan on 14 August 1967, exactly 20 years after the country's independence.&lt;ref name=McGarr&gt;{{cite book |last=McGarr |first=Paul |date=2013 |title=The Cold War in South Asia: Britain, the United States and the Indian Subcontinent, 1945-1965 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdGaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR9&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FQm_iLMrmF&amp;sig=Q4lTpVy_EH9oMPaVR15Ptx0WlnY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwqenk_f_JAhWBXSYKHS_zA9sQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Rawalpindi was the capital, designated in 1958.&lt;ref name=McGarr/&gt; The first capital of Pakistan was the coastal city of [[Karachi]], which was selected by [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. &lt;ref name=McGarr/&gt; Karachi was and still is the largest city and economic capital of Pakistan. It remained the seat of government until 1959, when the military president, [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]], decided to build a new capital in the north of Pakistan, near the general headquarters of the [[Pakistani Armed Forces]] at [[Rawalpindi]]. 

The legislature was based in [[Dhaka|Dacca]] in the province of [[East Bengal]] (later renamed [[East Pakistan]]). 

The reasons for relocating the capital from Karachi are that it would reflect the diversity of the Pakistani people, it would be separated from the business and commercial activity of Karachi, and also it would be easily accessible from all parts of the country.&lt;ref name="dotgov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitislamabad.net/islamabad/files/file-detail.asp?var=history-of-islamabad|title=History of Islamabad|publisher=Capital Development Authority|accessdate=2008-01-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512180426/http://www.visitislamabad.net/islamabad/files/file-detail.asp?var=history-of-islamabad|archivedate=2016-05-12|df=}}&lt;br/&gt;linked from {{cite web|url=http://www.islamabad.gov.pk/islamabad/default.asp|title=Visit Islamabad: Islamabad the beautiful|publisher=Capital Development Authority|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012210555/http://www.islamabad.gov.pk/islamabad/default.asp|archivedate=2014-10-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move to Islamabad was not completed until the late 1960s and for some years several government ministries were based in nearby Rawalpindi.

==Regional capitals==
The capitals of the provinces and territories of Pakistan have remained the same since the 1970s when the current administrative structure was established. All four provincial capitals are the largest cities of their respective provinces.[[Pakistan]] has a total population of 207,774,520 according to 2017 census estimate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-13514-Population-shoots-up-by-47-percent-since-1998 Population shoots up by 47 percent since 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anti-apartheid activism ==
Coetzee was influenced by both the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] whilst he was in high school [[Uitenhage]] and the politically-charged atmosphere of the [[University of the Western Cape]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Coetzee was recruited into the then banned [[African National Congress]] in 1981 and went underground. In 1983 he was arrested by the [[apartheid]] government for his involvement in the ANC after documentation with his details were found during a raid led by the South African Defence Force into Lesotho.

He was arrested in 1983 after information linking him to the banned organisation was found during a raid by the SADF in Lesotho, where some of the ANC’s underground structures were based. He was then charged with perjury for refusing to testify against other ANC members and spent a year in [[Allandale Prison]].  

After prison, Coetzee worked for the Chemical Workers Industrial Union in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]] where he assisted in the formation of South Africa's largest trade union [[COSATU]].&lt;ref name="IOLnews" /&gt;

Coetzee was regarded as an important political organiser within the ANC and against apartheid.&lt;ref name="SundayIndpt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/sundayindependent/a-man-who-inspired-love-loyalty-1.1707124#.U6bHh_mSySo | title=A man who inspired love, loyalty | publisher=Sunday Independent | date=22 June 2014 | accessdate=22 June 2014 | author=Phillip, Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==

Following South Africa's first [[South African general election, 1994|democratic elections in 1994]] he became secretary to the [[Gauteng Provincial Legislature]].  Eight years later in 2002 he was appointed deputy secretary of the [[Parliament of South Africa]] and was promoted to secretary in 2012.&lt;ref name="IOLnews" /&gt;

== Death ==
Coetzee died of cancer on 13 June 2014.

The '''Ministry of Culture of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)''' ({{lang|ru|Министерство культуры СССР}}), formed in 1936, was one of the most important government offices in the Soviet Union. It was formerly (until 1946) known as the '''State Committee on the Arts''' ({{lang|ru|Комитет по делам искусств}}). The Ministry, at the all-Union level, was established in 1953, after existing as a [[State Committee of the Council of Ministers]] for several years. The Ministry was led by the [[Minister of Culture (Soviet Union)|Minister of Culture]], prior to 1953 a Chairman, who was nominated by the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] and confirmed by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet]], and was a member of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. It was responsible for the cultural affairs and activities within the Soviet Union.

The '''Ministry of Defence''' ('''MOD'''; {{lang-th|กระทรวงกลาโหม}}; {{RTGS|''Krasuang Kalahom''}}), is a [[Cabinet of Thailand|cabinet]]-level government department of the Kingdom of Thailand. The ministry controls and manages the [[Royal Thai Armed Forces]] to maintain national security, territorial integrity, and national defence. The armed forces of Thailand are composed of three branches: the [[Royal Thai Army]], [[Royal Thai Navy]], and [[Royal Thai Air Force]]. 

Although the [[King of Thailand]] is the supreme head of the Thai armed forces ({{lang-th|จอมทัพไทย}}), his position is only nominal. The ministry and the forces are administered by an appointed politician, the '''[[List of Defence Ministers of Thailand|Minister of Defence]]''', a member of the [[Cabinet of Thailand]]. The post of Minister of Defence has been held by General [[Prawit Wongsuwon]], who is also Deputy Prime Minister, since August 2014.

==History==
Initially, the Ministry was called ''Krom Kalahom'' ({{lang-th|กรมกลาโหม}}) and its head was called ''Samuha Kalahom'' ({{lang-th|สมุหกลาโหม}}), and it was charged with the protection of the [[Southern Thailand|southern border]]. It was founded in the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya period]] and was retained throughout the [[Rattanakosin_era#Bangkok_period|Rattanakosin period]]. The [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] in its current design was formed in 1887, by the order of King [[Chulalongkorn]], to create a permanent military command. This was a result of the increasing threat posed by Western powers. The ministry was first housed in an old horse-and-elephant stable opposite the [[Grand Palace]]. A [[Ministry of Defence headquarters (Thailand)|new European-style building]] was erected to house it. At first the ministry only commanded the army (founded in 1847), but then it incorporated the navy (founded in 1887), and finally, the air force (founded in 1913). In 1914, King [[Vajiravudh]] determined that the act providing for invoking [[martial law#Thailand|martial law]], first promulgated by his father in 1907, was not consistent with modern [[laws of war]] nor convenient for the preservation of the external or internal security of the state, so it was changed to the modern form that, with minor amendments, continues to be in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Budget==
For [[fiscal year]] 2018 (FY2018) the army's budget is 107,457 million [[Thai baht|baht]]; the navy's, 43,835 million baht; and the air force, 39,931 million baht.&lt;ref name=BB-2018/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1999">A '''minor injuries unit''' ('''MIU''') is a type of walk-in clinic service provided in some hospitals in the [[United Kingdom]]. Units are generally staffed by [[emergency]] [[nurse practitioner]]s (ENPs) who can work autonomously to treat minor injuries such as lacerations and fractures. Some units have access to X-ray facilities. There is some [[Consultant (medicine)|consultant]] input in training and supervision. No appointment is needed, and waiting times are often shorter than at [[emergency department]]s.

In 1994, a minor injuries unit opened at the [[Western General Hospital]], [[Edinburgh]] which became the first nurse-led unit in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/minor-injuries-clinic-is-major-asset-to-capital-1-1226010 |title=Minor injuries clinic is major asset to Capital |work=The Scotsman |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A two-year evaluation showed the service was run at an average cost of £33 per patient visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.rcni.com/doi/pdfplus/10.7748/ns1997.10.12.4.35.c2484 |title=Evaluation of a nurse-led minor injuries unit |first1=David |last1=Heaney |first2=Fiona |last2=Paxton |journal=[[Nursing Standard]] |date=15 October 1997 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=35–38 |doi=10.7748/ns1997.10.12.4.35.c2484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NBA logo.jpg|thumb|Narmada Bachao Andolan logo]]
'''''Narmada Bachao Andolan''''' (''NBA'') is a [[social movement]] consisting of ''[[adivasis]]'', [[farmer]]s, [[environmentalist]]s and [[human rights]] [[activist]]s against the number of large dams being built across the [[Narmada River]], which flows through the states of [[Gujarat, India|Gujarat]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Maharashtra]].
[[Narmada Dam|Sardar Sarovar Dam]] in Gujarat is one of the biggest dams on the river and was one of the first focal points of the movement. It is one of the many dams under the Narmada Dam Project whose main aim is to provide irrigation and electricity to people in these states.

Their mode of campaign includes court actions, [[hunger strike]]s, rallies and gathering support from notable film and art personalities. Narmada Bachao Andolan, with its leading spokespersons [[Medha Patkar]] and [[Baba Amte]], have received the [[Right Livelihood Award]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rightlivelihoodaward.org/laureates/medha-patkar-and-baba-amte-narmada-bachao-andolan/|title=Medha Patkar and Baba Amte / Narmada Bachao AndolanThe RightLivelihood Award|website=www.right livelihoodaward.org|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Right after independence under the newly formed government headed by Jawaharlal Nehru, investigations were carried out to evaluate mechanisms for using water from the [[Narmada River]],&lt;ref name="narmadapreinvestigation"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nca.gov.in/imp_date.html |title=Relevant dates prior to the constitution of the tribunal|work=Narmada Control Authority |accessdate=2008-02-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; which flows into the [[Arabian Sea]] after passing through the states of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Gujarat]]. The formation of the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal was triggered by interstate differences in implementing schemes and sharing of water by the [[Government of India]] on 6 October 1969 to adjudicate over the disputes.&lt;ref name="NWDT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Relevant dates prior to the constitution of the tribunal|work=Narmada Valley Development Government of Madhya Pradesh |accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunal investigated the matters referred to it and responded after more than 10 years. The Narmada Tribunal aimed to set out conditions regarding the resettlement and rehabilitation of those displaced by the dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Story of Narmada Bachao Andolan: Human Rights in the Global Economy and the Struggle Against the World Bank|last=Narula|first=Smita|publisher=New York University School of Law|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 1979, after ten years of investigation, the decision as given by the tribunal, with all the parties at dispute binding to it, was released by the Indian government.&lt;ref name="NWDT"/&gt;

As per the tribunal's decision, 30 major, 135 medium, and 3000 small dams, were granted approval for construction, including raising the height of the [[Sardar Sarovar Project|Sardar Sarovar dam]].&lt;ref name="NWDT"/&gt; This decision was motivated by the assumption that it would provide water to around forty million people, irrigation, and electricity to people in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Role of Law in Counter-Hegemonic Globalization and Global Legal Pluralism: Lessons from the Narmada Valley Struggle in India|last=Rajagopal|first=Balakrishnan|publisher=Leiden Journal of International Law|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=358|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the construction began.

In 1985, after hearing about the Sardar Sarovar dam, Medha Patkar and her colleagues visited the project site and noticed that project work being checked due to an order by the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forests]], Government of India. The reasons for this was cited as "non-fulfillment of basic environmental conditions and the lack of completion of crucial studies and plans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = William | title = Toward Sustainable Development?: Struggling Over India's Narmada River | publisher = M.

Furthermore, the officials related to the project had not even checked the land records and updated them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While [[World Bank]], the financing agency for this project, came into the picture, Patkar approached the Ministry of Environment to seek clarifications. She realized, after seeking answers from the ministry, that the project was not sanctioned at all and wondered as to how funds were even sanctioned by the World Bank. After several studies, they realized that the officials had overlooked the post project problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = William | title = Toward Sustainable Development?: Struggling Over India's Narmada River | publisher = M. E. Sharpe | year = 1995 | pages = 159–160 | isbn = 1-56324-341-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Patkar's channel of communication between the government and the residents, she provided critiques to the project authorities and the governments involved. At the same time, her group realized that all those displaced were given compensation only for the immediate standing crop and not for displacement and rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = William | title = Toward Sustainable Development?: Struggling Over India's Narmada River | publisher = M. E. Sharpe | year = 1995 | isbn = 1-56324-341-5 | page = 161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Patkar remained immersed in the Narmada struggle, she chose to quit her Ph.D. studies and focus entirely on the Narmada activity.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/imow-Patkar.pdf|title=Medha Patkar: Biography|work=Women in World History|accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, she organized a 36-day solidarity march among the neighboring states of the Narmada valley from Madhya Pradesh to the Sardar Sarovar dam site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mehta|first=Mona G.|date=2010-10-12|title=A river of no dissent: Narmada Movement and coercive Gujarati nativism|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19472498.2010.507023 |journal=South Asian History and Culture |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=509–528 |doi=10.1080/19472498.2010.507023|issn=1947-2498}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that the march was "a path symbolizing the long path of struggle (both immediate and long-term) that [they] really had".&lt;ref name="book166"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = William | title = Toward Sustainable Development?: Struggling Over India's Narmada River | publisher = M.

Within the focus of the NBA towards the stoppage of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, Patkar advised adding the World Bank to its propaganda.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Using the right to [[Fasting#Fasting as a statement|fasting]], she undertook a 22-day fast that almost took her life.&lt;ref name="fasting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/women_env/w_details.asp?w_id=224|title=Medha Patkar: Summary of Achievements|work=United Nations Environment Program |accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patkar's actions did force the World Bank to set up The Morse Commission, an independent review of the project.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Progress on the Environmental Front: The Regulation of Industry and Development in India |first1=Kathleen D. |last1=Yurchak |first2=Armin |last2=Rosencranz |journal=Hastings International and Comparative Law Review |year=1996|volume=19 |number=3 |page=515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their report clearly stated that the Bank's policies on environment and resettlement were being violated by the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Bank and Human Rights: The Need for Greater Accountability |last=Clark |first=Dana |publisher=HARV.

The Sardar Sarovar Dam's construction began again in 1999 after the construction was allowed and was declared finished in 2006. It was inaugurated in 2017 by Prime Minister [[Narendra Damodardas Modi]]. Since construction in 2017, the height has been increased from 138 meters to 163 meters.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

==Formation==
There were many groups such as Gujarat-based Narmada Asargrastha Samiti, Madhya Pradesh-based Narmada Ghati Nav Nirman Samiti (Committee for a New Life in the Narmada Valley) and Maharashtra-Based Narmada Dharangrastha Samiti (Committee for Narmada Dam-Affected People) who either believed in the need for fair rehabilitation plans for the people or who vehemently opposed dam construction despite a resettlement policy.&lt;ref name="book23"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = William | title = Toward Sustainable Development?: Struggling Over India's Narmada River | publisher = M. E. Sharpe | year = 1995 | isbn = 1-56324-341-5 | page = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narmada Bachao Andolan was also joined by several NGOs with local people, professionals, and activists as the founders with a non-violent approach.&lt;ref name="book23"/&gt; It was led by Medha Patkar. Nationally, they wanted an alternative structure of development and internationally, they wanted to build pressure on the World Bank to take accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Narula, Smita (2008). ''The Story of Narmada Bachao Andolan: Human Rights in the Global Economy and the Struggle Against the World Bank''. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

NBA's slogans include - Vikas Chahiye, Vinash Nahin! (Development wanted, not destruction) and "koi nahi hatega, bandh nahi banega!" (we won't move, the dam won't be constructed).&lt;ref&gt;Rajagopal, Balakrishnan (2005). ''The Role of Law in Counter-Hegemonic Globalization and Global Legal Pluralism: Lessons from the Narmada Valley Struggle in India''. 18 Leiden Journal of International Law. pp. 365– 366&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of the World Bank ==
The World Bank began working on the Narmada Project after it got clearance from the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Caufield, Catherine (1996). Masters of Illusion: The World Bank and the Poverty of Nations. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The bank sent a team for the assessment of the project in economic and technical terms.&lt;/&gt; This team didn't focus on the social or environmental issues.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Caufield, Catherine (1997). Masters of Illusion: The World Bank and the Poverty of Nations. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; What Jawaharlal Nehru thought of as temples of the independent India, i.e. the dams, have already displaced 11 million Indians.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

However, the Bank realised the harm that it had done by sanctioning the loan for the project and thus announced that the new projects should "ensure that, after a reasonable transition period, the displaced people regain at least their previous standard of living."&lt;/&gt;World Bank Operational Manual Statement No. 2.33: Social Issues Associated with Involuntary Settlement in Bank-Financed Projects.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the relocation process was flawed. Several tribal people have been harmed by the project. The Bank then adopted certain policies to ensure proper relocation of the tribal people and protect them from the forced relocation .&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Indian government, however, did not adopt these policies.&lt;ref&gt;Rajagopal, Balakrishnan (2005). The Role of Law in Counter-Hegemonic Globalisation and Global Legal Pluralism: Lessons from the Narmada Valley Struggle in India. 18 Leiden Journal of International Law. pp. 345– 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, irrespective of the harm done by the Sardar Sarovar project, the World bank sanctioned a loan to the state governments for construction purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Armin Rosencranz, Kathleen D. Yurchak. Progress on the Environmental Front: The Regulation of Industry and Development in India. 19 Hastings International and Company. p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; The Bank did ask for a proper resettlement design but also said, "The argument in favour of the Sardar Sarovar Project is that the benefits are so large that they substantially outweigh the costs of the immediate human and environmental disruption."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Medha Patkar and other protesters testified on the Bank's role in Washington D.C in 1989. This led to a build-up of pressure on the Bank to set an independent review to assess the situation at hand. A lot of support was withdrawn from the project after this.

The Morse Commission was established to look into the construction of the dam, and the environmental cost and human displacement in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Armin Rosencranz, Kathleen D. Yurchak (1996). Progress on the Environmental Front: The Regulation of Industry and Development in India. 19 Hastings International and Company. p.371.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, a Bank commissioned panel had complete access to the documents to form a report.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The 357 pages' report mentioned the lack of any environmental assessment undertaken either by the Indian Government or the World Bank.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In an internal referendum held, the Bank very closely voted for the continuation of the Narmada Dam Project.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Indian Government canceled the loan sanctioned by the World Bank on March 31, 1993.

== People involved ==
[[File:Arundhati Roy W.jpg|thumb|[[Arundhati Roy]]]]

Medha Patkar has been the guiding light of the movement. She has organized several fasts and satyagrahas. Patkar has also been to jail because of her desire to achieve right to life and livelihood for the suppressed people.

Another popular figure was [[Baba Amte]], known for his work against leprosy. He published a booklet called ''Cry O Beloved Narmada'' in 1989 to protest against the construction of the dams.&lt;ref&gt;Narula, Smita (2008). ''The Story of Narmada Bachao Andolan: Human Rights in the Global Economy and the Struggle Against the World Bank''. [[New York School of Law]]. p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the major celebrities who have shown their support for Narmada Bachao Andolan are [[Booker Prize]] winner [[Arundhati Roy]]&lt;ref name="Roopesh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=178526|title=Legitimising Narmada Bachao Andolan|work=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aamir Khan]].&lt;ref name="aamir_khan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080328/jsp/frontpage/story_9067283.jsp|title=Aamir faces trial by torch|last=Manjeet Warrior|first=Gajinder Singh|date=2008-03-28|work=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]|location=Calcutta, India|accessdate=2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also supported by music composer and bass guitarist in the band [[Indian Ocean (band) | Indian Ocean]], [[Rahul Ram]], who was actively involved in the movement from 1990 to 1995. &lt;ref name="rahul_ram"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/indian-oceans-rahul-ram-talks-about-the-bands-latest-album-the-process-of-making-music-and-activism/article6344978.ece|title=Taking life as it comes|date=2014-08-23|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 was the launch of ''Narmada: A Valley Rises'', by filmmaker [[Ali Kazimi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://socialdoc.net/ali-kazimi/narmada-a-valley-rises-1994/ | title=Narmada: A Valley Rises (1994) | publisher=Social Doc | work=Ali Kazimi | accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It documents the five-week Sangharsh Yatra of 1991. The film went on to win several awards and is considered by many to be a classic on the issue. In 1996, veteran documentary filmmaker, [[Anand Patwardhan]], made an award-winning documentary: ''A Narmada Diary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frif.com/cat97/k-o/a_narmad.html|title=A Narmada|accessdate=2008-06-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221235854/http://www.frif.com/cat97/k-o/a_narmad.html|archive-date=21 February 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alok Agarwal]], current member of the [[Aam Aadmi Party]], is an active figure in the movement.

Bihar CM [[Nitish Kumar]] participated in rally organised by NBA on the bank of Narmada at Rajghat on 16th Sep 2016. Expressing solidarity with the Andolan Mr. Nitish Kumar said "I have come from Patna to extend support to the agitation on the side of river Narmada here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newsworldindia.in/india/nitish-kumar-for-nationwide-liquor-ban/226671/ | title=Nitish Kumar For Nationwide Liquor Ban | publisher=[[News World India]] | date=September 17, 2016 | accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporting the NBA's main demand CM Nitish Kumar appealed to PM Mr Modi at Rajghat saying "Pradhan Mantri ji, don't close the gates of Sardar Sarovar Dam. Rehabilitate people not by giving cash, but giving them alternative land/employment. Don't make plans to drown 2.5 lakh people by closing the gates," he said in a statement released in Barwani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/City/Indore/Narmada-Bachao-Andolan-rolls-out-political-red-carpet-for-Nitish-in-Barwani/articleshow/54379063.cms|title=Narmada Bachao Andolan rolls out political red carpet for Nitish in Barwani - Times of India|author=|date=|website=indiatimes.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
The court ruled for Andolan, effecting an immediate stoppage of work at the dam and directing the concerned states to complete the rehabilitation and replacement process.&lt;ref name="WBloan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13818680.400-narmada-dam-fails-world-banks-final-test-.html|title=Narmada dam fails World Bank's final test|last=Miller|first=Susan|work=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It deliberated on this issue further for several years and finally upheld the Tribunal Award and allowed the construction to proceed, subject to conditions. The court introduced a mechanism to monitor the progress of resettlement [[pari passu]] with the raising height of the dam through the Grievance Redressal Authorities (GRA) in each party state. The decision referred in this document, given in 2000 after 7 years of deliberations, has paved the way for completing the project to attain full envisaged benefits. The court's final line of the order states, "Every endeavour shall be made to see that the project is completed as expeditiously as possible".&lt;ref name="SC_decision_2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/qrydisp.asp?tfnm=17165 |title=Judgment by the Supreme Court of India |work=Supreme Court of India, Justice Information System |accessdate=2008-04-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303155945/http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/qrydisp.asp?tfnm=17165 |archivedate=3 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to the verdict, Press Information Bureau (PIB) featured an article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Narmada Bachao Andolaan (NBA)has rendered a yeoman's service to the country by creating a high-level of awareness about the environmental and rehabilitation and relief aspects of Sardar Sarovar and other projects on the Narmada. But, after the court verdict it is incumbent on it to adopt a new role. Instead of 'damning the dam' any longer, it could assume the role of vigilant observer to see that the resettlement work is as humane and painless as possible and that the environmental aspects are taken due care of."&lt;ref name="after_SC_judgment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.myiris.com/features/article.php3?fl=001108161656|title=Verdict on Narmada 2000|work=Press Information Bureau, Government of India|last=Shukla|first=Dinkar|accessdate=2008-04-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714144349/http://pib.myiris.com/features/article.php3?fl=001108161656|archivedate=14 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Aftermath and criticism ==
Medha Patkar continues to fight for proper rehabilitation of the displaced people in Madhya Pradesh as well as the reception of the promised compensation by the Narmada Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Narula, Smita (2008). ''The Story of Narmada Bachao Andolan: Human Rights in the Global Economy and the Struggle Against the World Bank''. New York School of Law. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; This movement has brought forth the different notions of development. The Indian government has often argued that the cost of displacements are outweighed by the benefit derived from the Narmada Project, and thus, justified its construction. NBA, on the other hand has argued no matter how large the benefits, the cost to the society cannot be fulfilled.

Critics argue that dam's benefits include provision of drinking water, power generation and irrigation facilities. However, it is believed that the campaign, led by the NBA activists, has held up the project's completion, and NBA supporters have attacked on local people who accepted compensation for moving.&lt;ref name="kirk_leech_dambusters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/03/india-narmada-dams|title=The Narmada dambusters are wrong|date=3 March 2009|publisher=The Guardian|location=London|author=Kirk Leech|accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that the Narmada Dam protesters are little more than environmental extremists, who use [[pseudoscientific]] [[agitprop]] to scuttle the development of the region and that the dam will provide agricultural benefits to millions of poor in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcivilisation.com/aginatur/prog1.htm|title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|date=2007-12-14|publisher=Web.archive.org|accessdate=2012-09-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219112400/http://www.ourcivilisation.com/aginatur/prog1.htm|archivedate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080907/jsp/7days/story_9799075.jsp|title=The Telegraph&amp;nbsp;— Calcutta (Kolkata) - 7days&amp;nbsp;— Goddesses of all causes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had also been instances of the NBA activists turning violent and attacking rehabilitation officer from [[Narmada Valley Development Authority]] (NVDA), which caused damage to the contractor's machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.digitaltoday.in/indiatoday/20060515/controvr.html|title=INDIA TODAY - The most widely read newsweekly in South Asia.|author=|date=|website=archives.digitaltoday.in|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Popular Party''' ({{lang-ro|Partidul Național Popular}}, PNP) was an [[Antifascism|antifascist]] political party in [[Romania]], founded during World War II as the underground '''Union of Patriots''' (''Uniunea Patrioților'', UP). The latter had defined itself as a spontaneous movement of resistance to the dictatorial regime of [[Ion Antonescu]], but was largely known as a front for the illegal [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCdR, later PCR). Its founders—[[Dumitru Bagdasar]], [[Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa]], [[Simion Stoilow]]—were closely cooperating with PCdR men, but also with liberal opposition forces. Repressed by the authorities, the UP made a comeback after the pro-[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[King Michael's Coup|August 23 Coup]] of 1944, when it endured as a small ally of the communists—mostly controlled directly by them, but sometimes rebellious.

Defining itself as a party for the middle classes, the PNP sought to attract into its ranks both nationalists and ethnic minorities, and was used by the Communist Party as a means of weakening the traditional parties. From 1945, it registered its most significant successes among the repenting [[Fascism|fascists]], absorbing into its ranks former members of the [[Iron Guard]]. The UP and PNP were instrumental in helping the PCR reach some of its main objectives, including the overthrow of [[Nicolae Rădescu]] and the hastening of [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]].

The PNP was nominally loyal to [[King of Romania|King]] [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]], but had no longer a part to play in decision-making when Michael was overthrown on the closing days of 1947. The party itself survived the [[Romanian legislative election, 1948|1948 election]], but was dissolved by its leaders in early 1949, reportedly under pressure from the new government. Its former activists were either integrated into the structures of the [[Communist Romania|communist state]] or repressed and, in some cases, imprisoned by the latter.

==History==

===Wartime opposition===
The UP's roots were planted in a semi-clandestine intellectual movement that opposed Antonescu's regime in general and, in particular, its support for [[Nazi Germany]] and the other [[Axis Powers]], and its commitment to war against the [[Soviet Union]]. According to its own records, the UP emerged clandestinely in early 1942, centered on the activities of three left-leaning intellectuals: the brain surgeon Bagdasar, the sociologist Vlădescu-Răcoasa, and the mathematician Stoilow. As listed by historian Corneliu Crăciun, the group's explicit goals were: "sabotaging the war industry, resisting the dispatch of men on [[Eastern Front (World War II)|the anti-Soviet front]], organizing partisans into detachments, annulling the [[Second Vienna Award|Vienna Diktat]], peace with the USA, England and the USSR."&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, p. 299. The same goals are attested by Covaci (pp. 167–169) with a different emphasis&lt;/ref&gt; Vlădescu-Răcoasa had a background in politics, initially as an affiliate of the [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalists]], then as an internationalist and antifascist with strong [[Marxism|Marxist]] leanings.&lt;ref&gt;Rostás, in Bulgaru, pp. XI–XIII. See also Boia, p. 174; [[N. D. Cocea]], Al. Gh. Savu, "Jurnal", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', May 1968, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; He had also been registered as a member of the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927–48)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSDR).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Bagdasar was educated abroad, where he became inspired by [[Progressivism in the United States|American progressivism]],&lt;ref name="pțcronicar2"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Pavel Țugui]], [http://www.romlit.ro/george_ivacu_cronicar_de_rzboi_la_ziarul_vremea_1941-1944_continuare_din_numrul_anterior_al_revistei "George Ivașcu, cronicar de război, la ziarul ''Vremea'' (1941-1944). II"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 18/2013&lt;/ref&gt; while Stoilow had frequented meetings of pro-Allied intellectuals, some of whom supported the mainstream [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first notable actions of the UP was publishing, starting with January 1943, the illegal newspaper ''[[România Liberă]]'',&lt;ref name="pțcronicar2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crăciun, p. 299"&gt;Crăciun, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; later joined by another antifascist organ, ''Lupta Patriotică''.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2010), pp. 293, 295&lt;/ref&gt; The former was reportedly designed to appear in September–November 1942, but was discovered by the ''[[Siguranța]]'' police and could reemerge only in January of the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Covaci, p. 170; Crăciun, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; According to various accounts, the former newspaper was managed in [[Bucharest]] by [[George Ivașcu]], on his spare time from editing the pro-Antonescu gazette ''[[Vremea]]'' and with only marginal interventions from the PCdR.&lt;ref name="pțcronicar2"/&gt; Party historians claimed that the newspaper "kept the popular masses informed" on the growth of resistance,&lt;ref&gt;Covaci, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Crăciun notes that its circulation was exceedingly small.&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, pp. 299, 300&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian Radu Păiușan claims that the UP's history can be traced back to a propaganda operation carried out later by Romanian communists exiled on Soviet territory: in January 1943, [[Leonte Răutu]] supposedly created the newspaper ''România Liberă'', and a radio station of the same name, with which the Soviets intended to give the impression of a rising antifascist movement in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2010), pp. 292–293&lt;/ref&gt;

===PCdR contacts===
Several authors trace the original meeting between the UP and the PCdR to mid-1943. They refer to either the turn of tides on the front, after [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]],&lt;ref name="pțcronicar2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pț(09)48"&gt;Țugui (2009), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; or to involvement, in 1943, of PCdR men [[Constantin Agiu]] and [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]], who took it upon themselves to reorganize the Union from November 1943.&lt;ref name="ps6mart"&gt;{{ro icon}} Paltin Sturdza, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/6-martie-1945-guvern-general-avramescu-dr-petru-groza "6 martie 1945: Guvern general Avramescu sau dr. Petru Groza?"], in ''Historia'', April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The two were subsequently joined by other communists or communist sympathizers, including [[Mihai Levente]], [[Mihai Magheru]], and [[Stanciu Stoian]].&lt;ref&gt;Covaci, p. 169; Crăciun, pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; Vlădescu-Răcoasa was the first person identified as leader of the UP,&lt;ref name="pțcronicar2"/&gt; while Agiu was designated Caretaker; Constantinescu-Iași and Bagdasar were tasked with co-opting intellectuals, while Levente served as the administrator and Magheru directed work in the provinces.&lt;ref name="ebxxxiii"&gt;Bulgaru, p. XXXIII&lt;/ref&gt; Nicu Rădescu, the estranged and ill-reputed son of General [[Nicolae Rădescu]],&lt;ref name="odfiul"&gt;{{ro icon}} Oana Demetriade, [http://www.revista22.ro/fiul-impotriva-tatalui-securistul-nicu-radescu-vs-primul-ministrul-nicolae-radescu-32871.html "Fiul împotriva tatălui. Securistul Nicu Rădescu vs. primul ministrul Nicolae Rădescu"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 1232, October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; was also closely cooperating with both the PCdR and the UP.&lt;ref name="mbsbilegalist"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Burcea, Sidonia Bogdan, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/special/documentare/marturiile-unui-ilegalist-comunist--unde-conspirau-sa-puna-mana-pe-puterea-de-la-bucuresti-306279 "Mărturiile unui ilegalist comunist: unde conspirau să pună mână pe puterea de la București"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', July 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this guidance, the UP contacted a group of high-ranking soldiers who were seeking to depose Antonescu, the most active of whom was [[Gheorghe Avramescu]]—who was at once an antifascist and anticommunist.&lt;ref name="ps6mart"/&gt; The UP also left a historical record as a member of the PCdR's Patriotic Antihitlerite Front, which also included the revived [[Ploughmen's Front]] and two other small political groups: the [[Socialist Peasants' Party]], the [[Hungarian People's Union]] (MADOSZ). The association pact was sealed in August 1943, after a secretive meeting in which the UP was represented by Bagdasar and an N. Dinulescu.&lt;ref&gt;Covaci, pp. 178–179; Crăciun, pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the Front, the UP still maintained links with other opposition groups, and was especially close to left-wing Social Democrats ([[Ion Pas]], [[Ștefan Voitec]], [[Theodor Iordăchescu]], [[Leon Ghelerter]]).&lt;ref&gt;Covaci, pp. 176, 177, 179&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 1943, Magheru, as UP representative, held talks with the PNȚ, aiming to "create a broad coalition of the democratic and patriotic forces toward bring down the Antonescu regime".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cernovodeanu, "Cronici de familii. Magherii", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', September 1977, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the UP's Central Committee took residence in the same building as the PCdR archive, at the Wexler residence on Crângului Street 15, Bucharest.&lt;ref name="mbsbilegalist"/&gt; It soon reported having some thousands of members of all ethnic backgrounds, and representation in all the main cities,&lt;ref name="pțcronicar2"/&gt; with most active cells in university towns and among schoolteachers' unions.&lt;ref name="ccr300"&gt;Crăciun, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; It also touted its presence among the workers, especially those at the [[Căile Ferate Române|Romanian Railway Company]], whom it encouraged on sabotage missions.&lt;ref&gt;Covaci, pp. 187–191&lt;/ref&gt; According to official records, the first registered members also included [[Iorgu Iordan]] and [[Ștefan Vencov]], with outside sympathizers such as [[Zevedei Barbu]], [[Constantin Balmuș]], [[Eduard Mezincescu|Eduard]] and [[Florica Mezincescu]], [[Mircea Florian]], [[David Prodan]], [[Teodor Bugnariu]], [[Alexandru Graur]], [[Constantin Daicoviciu]], [[Constantin I. Parhon]], [[Bazil Munteanu]], and [[Mihai Ralea]].&lt;ref&gt;Covaci, pp. 169, 171–174. See also Boia, pp. 235–237&lt;/ref&gt; Another version suggests that Zevedei Barbu, who was also a PCdR man, was helped by [[Alexandru Roșca]] with establishing a UP nucleus at [[Babeș-Bolyai University|Cluj University]] (which had relocated to [[Sibiu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 207–208&lt;/ref&gt; All these records obscure the participation of the PNȚ which, through [[Ioan Hudiță]], also claimed to have established this intellectual opposition movement.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 235–236&lt;/ref&gt;

===1943–1944: repression and resurgence===
[[File:Miting în Piața Universității organizat cu ocazia intrării trupelor sovietice în București, 30 aug. 44. Ceaușescu, Răcoasa.jpg|thumb|340px|[[Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa]] (center) with the PCdR's [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] and Andrei Pătrașcu, at a meeting of solidarity with the [[Red Army]]. Bucharest, August 30, 1944]]
In May 1943, ''Siguranța'' had captured an UP man, the statistician Mircea Biji, who was interrogated and agreed to cooperate, leading the authorities into UP safe houses.&lt;ref name="mbsbilegalist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="luapostolii"&gt;{{ro icon}} Laurențiu Ungureanu, [http://adevarul.ro/cultura/istorie/apostolii-stalin-petru-groza-ultimul-burghez-tentativa-esuata-suicid-idila-elena-lupescu-divortul-decent-elegant-monarhie-1_544a83ca0d133766a8356761/index.html "Apostolii lui Stalin: Petru Groza, ultimul burghez. De la tentativa eșuată de suicid la idila cu Elena Lupescu și 'divorțul decent şi elegant de monarhie'"], in ''[[Adevărul]]'', October 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the authorities issued an arrest warrant for psychologist [[Mihai Beniuc]], identifying him as another UP liaison—in fact, Beniuc had yet to join the group, and was largely unaware of its activities.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 213, 216, 220&lt;/ref&gt; On December 15, the secret police organized its sting operation. At Crângului, it chanced upon a trove of PCdR documents, filed by [[Remus Koffler]], with incriminating evidence about the UP. Several were arrested, including Vlădescu-Răcoasa and Magheru.&lt;ref name="mbsbilegalist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="luapostolii"/&gt; The landowner [[Petru Groza]], founder of the Ploughmen's Front, was also picked up, the documents having revealed that he was sponsoring the UP.&lt;ref name="luapostolii"/&gt;

In all, fifty men and women suspected of UP membership or sympathies were subjected to a mass trial in first two months of 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Covaci, pp. 184–185; Crăciun, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; While Groza's release was ordered by Antonescu himself,&lt;ref name="luapostolii"/&gt; Vlădescu-Răcoasa found himself sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. The court found him guilty of "endangering State order and security".&lt;ref name="ebxxxiii"/&gt; Similar sentences were handed to Zevedei Barbu,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; to Magheru, and to Magheru's wife Anca.&lt;ref name="mbsbilegalist"/&gt; Bagdasar, by then also a member of the PCdR, took charge of the UP,&lt;ref name="pțcronicar2"/&gt; with Agiu taking a Central Committee seat.&lt;ref&gt;Covaci, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Before April 1944, the movement was involved in negotiations with the PNȚ and the PCdR-backed left-leaning circles of [[Iași]]. Together, they wrote an open letter of protest to Antonescu, asking for Romania's immediate withdrawal from the Eastern Front.&lt;ref name="pțcronicar2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 235–236; Covaci, pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt; On May 24, 1944, the Union also entered a "National-Democratic Coalition", alongside the [[National Liberal Party–Tătărescu]], Groza's Front, the PSDR, the PSȚ, MADOSZ, and [[Petre Topa]]'s [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalists]].&lt;ref&gt;Tiberiu Dumitru Costăchescu, "Partidul Național Liberal în anii regimurilor autoritare (februarie 1938 – august 1944)", in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 2/2006, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1944, the PCdR had joined a pan-resistance National Democratic Bloc (BND), which also included the PNȚ, PSDR, and the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL). Together with [[King of Romania|King]] [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] and his court, the group carried out the [[King Michael's Coup|August 23 Coup]], resulting in Antonescu's arrest and the unilateral cession of war with the Allies. Just one day after the coup, Vlădescu-Răcoasa was freed and resumed political activities in the open, introduced by the party press as "the combatant for Romanian freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaru, p. XXXIV&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, UP members were on hand at the rally held to greet the [[Red Army]] upon its entrance into Bucharest,&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abasclepios"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandra Bellow]], [http://www.revista22.ro/articol-1115.html "Asclepios versus Hades în România (II)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 755, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; the effective start of [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]].

By October 1944, when it had established chapters in all of [[sectors of Bucharest]],&lt;ref name="ccr300"/&gt; the UP had moved its headquarters on Spătarului Street. This was a former hospice of the [[Wehrmacht]], evacuated during the street fighting, and reportedly vandalized "beyond belief" by the UP's own members.&lt;ref name="agvechicu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alexandru George, [http://www.romlit.ro/revenind_la_vechi_cuvinte_noi "Revenind la vechi cuvinte noi"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 8/2011&lt;/ref&gt; While assuming a public face, the Union had to abandon its political newspaper: ''România Liberă'' was seized by the PCdR, and its first issue of this new series, presumed lost, was falsified by the PCR after 1972.&lt;ref name="lbcvfals"&gt;{{ro icon}} Lavinia Betea, Cristina Vohn, [http://jurnalul.ro/scinteia/istoria-comunismului/inedit-primul-ziar-legal-al-pcdr-a-fost-falsificat-34677.html "Inedit. Primul ziar legal al PCdR a fost falsificat"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', October 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In its stead, on September 15, the UP inaugurated ''Tribuna Poporului'', which was entrusted to [[George Călinescu]], the literary historian and novelist.&lt;ref&gt;Țugui (2009), pp. 47–48. See also Boia, pp. 282, 288–290&lt;/ref&gt; The UP also sponsored Călinescu's foreign-policy review, ''[[Lumea]]''.&lt;ref name="pț(09)48"/&gt;

Following negotiations at the beginning of September, the Union absorbed the rump [[Romanian Socialist Party (Popovici)|Socialist Party]] led by [[Vasile Anagnoste]].&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe Onişoru, ''Alianțe și confruntări între partidele politice din România: 1944-1947'', Fundaţia Academia Civică, Bucharest, 1996, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, the UP and its former Patriotic Antihitlerite colleagues formed a political alliance called [[People's Democratic Front (Romania)|National Democratic Front]] (FND), which also comprised the PSDR. As UP envoys, Vlădescu-Răcoasa, Bagdasar and Stoilow held a seat each on the FND National Council.&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaru, p. XXXIV; Păiușan (2010), p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; The new pact, comprising forces that were vastly unequal to each other,&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; was sealed only after the communists had resumed their pressures on the PNL and PNȚ, both of which refused to join a long-term alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2010), pp. 294, 296&lt;/ref&gt; According to anticommunist diplomat Emil Ciurea, it pitted one of the PCdR's alliances (Antihitlerites, "enriched by the arrival of [the PSDR] socialists") against the other (BND).&lt;ref name="ecc872"&gt;Ciurea, p. 872&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout October, the UP was a participant in the PCdR-organized public rallies against the independent [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier]], General [[Constantin Sănătescu]], and his PNȚ and PNL ministers, accusing the cabinet of playing protector to war criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 55–56; Păiușan (2010), pp. 296–297&lt;/ref&gt; Vlădescu-Răcoasa was active in the intrigue, and, at a public rally held in [[Călărași]], discussed the imperative of creating "the new Romania at all costs".&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaru, p. XXXV&lt;/ref&gt; On November 4, following a Soviet intervention, Sănătescu reshuffled his cabinet, with a third of the ministerial mandates, and sizable portions of provincial administrative offices, going to FND politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2010), pp. 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; In newly liberated [[Northern Transylvania]], this meant the UP's integration at the highest level of local government. The FND, cooperating with MADOSZ, contemplated making the region into an autonomous entity, and organized an executive Northern Transylvanian Committee that included two UP activists. This body was in conflict with the PNȚ and PNL, its rallies allegedly broken up by the [[Maniu Guards]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagy &amp; Vincze, pp. 61–62, 71&lt;/ref&gt; Finally joining the UP, Beniuc was sent into the region, organizing new chapters for both the Union and the Ploughmen's Front.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

===FND alliance and 1945 turmoil===
[[File:Pr. Burducea, CGSU 30 ian 1945. Dej, Stoica, Pauker, Nicolau, Brătfăleanu, Sencovici.jpg|thumb|330px|[[Constantin Burducea]] addressing the Congress of Unified Labor Unions, Bucharest, on January 30, 1945.

Vlădescu-Răcoasa was briefly appointed Minister for Minority Affairs (renamed by him "for Nationalities"), serving until February 1945, after which he was demoted to Undersecretary.&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaru, pp. XXXV–XXXVII; Miron, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; During December 1944, the FND was co-opted into the new cabinet formed by General Rădescu, but continued to air its tensions with the two liberal parties with which it shared power. The UP followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaru, p. XXXVI; Păiușan (2010), p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Involved with Groza in Northern Transylvanian affairs,&lt;ref&gt;Nagy &amp; Vincze, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; statistician [[Sabin Manuilă]], a former PNȚ supporter and participant in the August 1944 Coup,&lt;ref name="lbcvfals"/&gt; was also welcomed into the UP, then appointed Undersecretary of State for Stately Organization.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2010), p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; The party's reservoir of cadres expanded to include many intellectuals associated with Constantinescu-Iași, for instance Balmuș and Zevedei Barbu. The latter served as UP recruiter in [[Sibiu County]].&lt;ref&gt;Blaga, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; With Constantinescu-Iași, Balmuș served as a UP representative to assemblies commemorating [[Holocaust in Romania|Antonescu's antisemitic crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;Gușu, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; Also joining the UP was physicist [[Ilie G. Murgulescu]], who edited the daily a UP regional mouthpiece in [[Banat]].&lt;ref name="rp(12)389"&gt;Păiușan (2012), p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

During that period, the UP involved itself in the campaign against Rădescu, headlined by the Communist Party (which was now known as PCR, rather than PCdR). They agitated for [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]] and organized the campaign against [[price gouging]]. In [[Jiu Valley]] and [[Hunedoara County]] at large, the UP carried out "democratic work" in favor of miners' welfare, distributing food and setting up price control committees.&lt;ref&gt;Ștefan Nemecsek, ''Presa hunedoreană (de la origini până în prezent)'', Vol. I, Realitatea Românească, Vulcan, 2007, pp. 200–201.  {{ISBN|978-973-88085-3-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the country, its activists joined hands with the Ploughmen's Front, redistributing to the peasants most of the plots that were over 50 [[hectare]]s.&lt;ref name="gmoi108"&gt;Moisa, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Nicu Rădescu and Levente were directly involved in the effort to create and illegally arm a communist-controlled paramilitary force, the Patriotic Combat Formations (''Formațiunile de Luptă Patriotică'', FLP).&lt;ref name="odfiul"/&gt; Literary critic Niculae Gheran, who was involved with the UP paramilitary as a teenager, recalls that the atmosphere was still largely apolitical, and that the formations were set out to eradicate criminality.&lt;ref&gt;Gheran, pp. 301–312&lt;/ref&gt; The "game of cops and robbers" ended when [[Eugen Alimănescu]] of the [[Romanian Police|Bucharest Police]] took control of the situation, with crude but effective methods.&lt;ref&gt;Gheran, pp. 306–308&lt;/ref&gt;

As a witness to the political crisis, King Michael probably contemplated replacing Rădescu with the old UP associate, General Avramescu.&lt;ref name="ps6mart"/&gt; The latter had earned distinction in the [[Siege of Budapest]], and was respected by the Red Army, but evidently resented Soviet interference. Vlădescu-Răcoasa noted Avramescu's acceptance of the FND program, but the PCdR refused to take him into consideration.&lt;ref name="ps6mart"/&gt; Meanwhile, the demonstrations turned violent on February 24, when communists staged an assault on the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Internal Affairs Ministry]] and were pushed back. Several protesters were killed by gunshot, but later investigation uncovered that the bullets were not of the standard caliber used in the Ministry.&lt;ref name="odfiul"/&gt; Nicu Rădescu, who was hiding out at the UP's headquarters, participated in the propaganda effort, publicly accusing his father of murder.&lt;ref name="odfiul"/&gt;

On March 6, 1945, Groza eventually managed to topple Premier Rădescu, who escaped to [[British Cyprus (1914–1960)|British Cyprus]],&lt;ref name="odfiul"/&gt; and set up a communist-dominated cabinet, with Constantinescu-Iași as the new [[Ministry of Communications and Information Society (Romania)|Information Minister]]. Also joining the cabinet as the UP's appointees was [[Grigore Vasiliu Rășcanu]], the [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|Minister of War]].&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; Bagdasar was appointed [[Ministry of Health (Romania)|Minister of Health]], and, as a technocrat tasked with managing the nationwide health crisis, earned the respect of his political adversaries.&lt;ref name="abasclepios"/&gt;

General Avramescu, meanwhile, was killed in a mysterious incident on the [[Slovak National Uprising|Slovakian front]], most likely kidnapped and shot by the Soviets.&lt;ref name="ps6mart"/&gt; The UP resumed its orthodox political stance. Rădescu's son, by then a card-carrying communist, was tasked with purging the Union of political undesirables, then assigned over to the ''Siguranța'', which he helped transform into the [[Securitate]].&lt;ref name="odfiul"/&gt; At the time, the UP also organized its religious wing for "highly conscious" [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priests, called Union of Democratic Priests (''Uniunea Preoților Democrați'', UPD) and led by the UP's Minister of Religious Affairs, [[Constantin Burducea]].&lt;ref&gt;Enache, pp. 60–62; Kalkandjieva, pp. 266–267&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 1945, Groza's military and paramilitary forces repressed a popular demonstration marking the anniversary of Michael I, who was still the raining monarch. As noted by historian [[Ioan Lăcustă]], these events ended in "a bloodbath", ordered by Groza's Interior Minister, [[Teohari Georgescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Lăcustă, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; According to PNȚ investigators such as [[Corneliu Coposu]], the UP was directly involved, asking its activists to stage a counter-manifestation in [[Revolution Square, Bucharest|Palace Square]], and to prevent the monarchists from reaching the Square.&lt;ref&gt;Tudor Călin Zarojanu, ''Viața lui Corneliu Coposu'', Editura Mașina de Scris, Bucharest, 2005, pp. 37, 42.  {{ISBN|973-8491-23-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UP's press made ample reference to the events, reinterpreting them according to communist guidelines, whereas the independent newspapers were barred from even reporting on them.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcustă, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

===PNP creation===

Editorship was assigned to Călinescu, who was in the process of adapting his work to [[Marxist literary criticism|Marxist doctrines]], and was by then a member of the PNP Executive Committee.&lt;ref name="înobiectiv"/&gt; It heralded radical attacks against the political opposition, from the disgraced far-right to the PNȚ.&lt;ref name="înobiectiv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boa, pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, the newspaper still preserved a nominal independence in the selection of its literary staff, publishing the essays of [[Adrian Marino]] and [[Alexandru Piru]], which were still untouched by the communist style.&lt;ref name="înobiectiv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esdamnarea"&gt;{{ro icon}} Elvira Sorohan, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/SOROHANoct7.html "Damnarea cărturarului"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iscastrator"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioan Stanomir]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/*articleID_25869-articles_details.html "G.

With assistance from its communist backers, the PNP soon began a large recruitment campaign. Among those who signed up were several famous literary and scientific figures, including poet [[Alexandru A. Philippide]], historian [[Andrei Oțetea]], and biologist [[Traian Săvulescu]];&lt;ref name="gmoi108"/&gt; literary critic [[Mihai Gafița]], a former PNL man, was its students' wing representative.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. Brătescu]], ''Ce-a fost să fie. Notații autobiografice'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2003, pp. 158, 170, 189.  {{ISBN|973-50-0425-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Murgulescu's Banat sections, new recruits included General [[Teodor Șerb]] (President of the PNP Chapter in [[Timiș-Torontal County]]), physicist [[Valeriu Novacu]] (who went on to serve as [[Prefect (Romania)|County Prefect]]), poet [[Alexandru Jebeleanu]], and industrialists Jacques Hellmann and Anton Hollander.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2012), pp. 384, 385, 386&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[National Peasants' Party–Alexandrescu|Alexandrescu Peasantists]], the PNP was specifically dedicated to undermining the PNȚ, that is to say the PCdR's most powerful opponent. Constantinescu-Iași recalled that, even in 1943, the UP was working to "set up opposition groups within the PNȚ", but "in such a manner that no group would be torn away from the party".&lt;ref&gt;Covaci, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by political scientist [[Ioan Stanomir]], the party was later a tool used by the PCdR "to gnaw at the PNȚ before they ultimately dissolved it".&lt;ref name="iscastrator"/&gt; This campaign was sparked in 1944 by a broadcast on [[Radio Moscow]].&lt;ref name="rp(10)300"&gt;Păiușan (2010), p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; By 1946, the PNP had only managed to absorb remnants of the interwar [[Radical Peasants' Party]], who had refused to rejoin the PNȚ.&lt;ref name="rp(13unu)511"&gt;Păiușan (2013 I), p. 511&lt;/ref&gt;

The recruitment drive was punctuated by episodes of dissent. Jebeleanu was almost removed from the party after he was found to be an insubordinate propagandist.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2013 I), p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; More embarrassingly, the PNP failed to enlist [[Lucian Blaga]], the celebrated poet-philosopher. Blaga admitted feeling terrorized by direct threats to his artistic independence, and, at the risk of marginalization, opted not to join&lt;ref&gt;Blaga, pp. 26–27; {{ro icon}} Ilie Rad, [http://www.romlit.ro/o_declaraie_inedit_a_lui_lucian_blaga "O declarație inedită a lui Lucian Blaga"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 13/2012&lt;/ref&gt; (or, according to another version, joined, was immediately made a member of the PNP Central Committee, and just as immediately resigned).&lt;ref&gt;George Neagoe, [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2013/11/jurnal-indirect/ "Jurnal indirect"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 445, November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Burducea, perceived by Groza as a political liability, was also sacked from his ministerial position,&lt;ref&gt;Enache, p. 71–74, 76–78&lt;/ref&gt; and the UPD chairmanship was assigned to an Ion Vască.&lt;ref&gt;Kalkandjieva, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22–24, 1946, the PNP held its annual reunion in Bucharest, culminating in a popular assembly presided upon by Oțetea.&lt;ref name="rp(13unu)511"/&gt; On May 16,&lt;ref&gt;Miron, pp. 228, 322; Terteci, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; the PNP was co-opted by a communist-led electoral alliance, the Bloc of Democratic Parties (BPD). In early November, its representative in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] and PNP General Secretary, a Mihail Dragomirescu, played a central part in the sessions which condemned and pushed aside a minor PCR ally, the [[National Liberal Party–Tătărescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Razi, pp. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were notable setbacks for the PNP, including the sudden disappearance of Călinescu's ''Lumea''.&lt;ref name="înobiectiv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Also in May, Bagdasar resigned as Health Minister and took a diplomatic posting, but died of cancer before he could take office.&lt;ref name="abasclepios"/&gt; In September of that year, his widow [[Florica Bagdasar]] made history by becoming the first ever Romanian woman minister, after being assigned the Health portfolio.&lt;ref name="abasclepios"/&gt; Mitiță Constantinescu also died at that time, prompting the PNP executive to elect Vlădescu-Răcoasa in his place.&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaru, pp. XLIX–L. See also Cioroianu, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

===1946 election and 1947 takeover===
In the [[Romanian general election, 1946|general election of November 1946]], which was rigged through fraud and voter intimidation,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 246–247; Cioroianu, pp. 64–66; Terteci, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; the Bloc claimed a decisive victory. However, the PNP only had a minor role to play in the campaign, with a reported 7% of the BPD candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2013 II), p. 961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Doron Dobrincu, [http://www.revista22.ro/stalin-si-pregatirea-alegerilor-din-romania-anului-1946-4720.html "Stalin și pregătirea alegerilor din România anului 1946"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 960, July–August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The BPD and MADOSZ had counted 79.86% of the vote in its favor, obtaining 378 of the 414 total Assembly of Deputies seats,&lt;ref name="ct173"&gt;Terteci, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; of which the PNP held 26.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]], Philip Stöver, ''Elections in Europe: A Data Handbook'', Nomos, Baden-Baden, 2010, p. 1610.  {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constantinescu-Iași ran and won as head of the electoral list in [[Tutova County]], returning to serve as Information Minister;&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe Clapa, "Lupta forțelor democratice din fostul județ Tutova pentru victoria Blocului Partidelor Democratice în alegerile parlamentare din noiembrie 1946", in ''Acta Moldaviae Meridionalis.

The PNP withdrew from the Groza cabinet on November 29, 1946,&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaru, pp. XXXVII, L–LI&lt;/ref&gt; in protest at what it felt was its under-representation. It found itself in an unusual situation as the [[loyal opposition]] to the BPD, stating its refusal to attack any of the Bloc's politicians.&lt;ref&gt;"Cum stă lumea și țara?", in ''Unirea Poporului'', December 8, 1946, p. 3; Păiușan (2013 II), pp. 961–962, 966&lt;/ref&gt; Both Bagdasar and Săvulescu continued to serve in the cabinet, the latter as [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Romania)|Agriculture Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 261; Bulgaru, pp. LIII, LV&lt;/ref&gt; The PNP's withdrawal from power, and its general subservience to the BPD, were noted factors of stress at a local level.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2013 II), pp. 956–962&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was able to attract more followers with the dissolution of [[Constantin Argetoianu]]'s National Union of Labor and Rebirth (UNMR). Two of the latter's pro-communist wings were absorbed at the time: the UNMR tradesmen wing, under Petre Misale, and the formerly independent National Agrarian Action, directed by Paul Iliescu and Max Schapira.&lt;ref&gt;Petre Otu, "1946–1947. Se pregătește guvernul Argetoianu!", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', May 2000, pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1947, after the [[Tămădău Affair]] and news of an [[Romanian anti-communist resistance movement|anti-communist partisan movement]], PNP representatives supported the communist motion to outlaw the PNȚ.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, pp. 310–311&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, ''Națiunea'' and Călinescu himself joined in the denunciation campaign, publishing propaganda pieces that maligned the imprisoned PNȚ-ists.&lt;ref name="înobiectiv"/&gt; Other party members used their last opportunity to escape the country: Manuilă settled in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Zevedei Barbu defected in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Claudiu Pădurean, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/cultura/carte/cum-este-recuperata-biografia-lui-zevedei-barbu-357695 "Cum este recuperată biografia lui Zevedei Barbu"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', November 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; During the following months, the PNP was in favor of a bill that politicized and de-professionalized the justice system, introducing juries selected from among the "workers and toiling peasants" by their respective trade unions and corporate bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, pp. 316–317&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, Vlădescu-Răcoasa became [[Romanian Ambassador to Russia|Ambassador to Moscow]], which was perceived as a "posting of overwhelming importance" in that context.&lt;ref&gt;Rostás, in Bulgaru, p. XIII&lt;/ref&gt; Still the PNP president, he was abroad when the communists imposed abdication on King Michael and proclaimed the [[Communist Romania|People's Republic]]. On February 1, 1948, the PNP resumed its activities in the new republic: the Bucharest branch of the PNP elected Balmuș as its chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaru, p. LVIII&lt;/ref&gt; While still serving abroad, Vlădescu-Răcoasa was appointed by the Assembly of Deputies, reformed into the [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber-stamp]] [[Great National Assembly]], to a committee drafting a [[1948 Constitution of Romania|socialist constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaru, p. LIX&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissolution and aftermath===
The PNP remained closely aligned with the Romanian Workers' Party (PMR), as the PCR styled itself after absorbing the Social Democrats. From February 1948, it was part of the [[People's Democratic Front (Romania)|People's Democratic Front]] (FPD), an electoral alliance formed with the PMR, the Ploughmen's Front, and MADOSZ. Constantinescu-Iași, Dragomirescu, and Alexandru Șteflea were its delegates on the FPD National Council.&lt;ref&gt;"Constituirea Frontului Democrației Populare. Comunicat", in ''[[Scînteia]]'', February 29, 1948, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Romanian legislative election, 1948|subsequent elections]] were advertised by PMR leader [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] as a consolidation of "democratic conquests against imperialism", destined to "nip in the bud all attempts by the reaction to rear its head".&lt;ref&gt;Ciurea, p. 880&lt;/ref&gt; Two decorative opposition forces were allowed to survive outside the FPD: the (reorganized) Tătărescu Liberals and the [[Peasants' Party–Lupu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ciurea, p. 881&lt;/ref&gt; The Front won 405 of the 414 seats, of which the PNP had 43. Vlădescu-Răcoasa, Almaș, Balmuș, Călinescu, Constantinescu-Iași, Oțetea and Săvulescu were among those returned to parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 310–311&lt;/ref&gt;

Elected as the last PNP president, Constantinescu-Iași was also designated a Vice President of the Great National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Petcu, p. 166. See also Bulgaru, p. LXI; Razi, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; However, the PNP survived until voting itself out of existence on February 6, 1949. The official notice informed its voters that, "under the watch of the Workers' Party", the PNP had "carried out the better part of its task", and that "to carry on as a separate organization would be an act of seclusion."&lt;ref&gt;Razi, p. 277. See also Ciurea, pp. 880–881; Nicolae Videnie, "Revolte anticomuniste ale țăranilor din Câmpia Română în 1948", in Ilie Popa, ''Experimentul Pitești (comunicări prezentate la Simpozionul internațional "Experimentul Pitești - Reeducarea prin tortură. Opresiunea țărănimii române în timpul dictaturii comuniste", ediția a 4-a, Pitești, 24-26 septembrie 2004)'', Editura Fundației Culturale Memoria, Bucharest, 2005, p. 256.  {{ISBN|973-86965-4-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Călinescu explained, in ''Națiunea'', the party and its newspaper's "historical mission" had been exhausted.&lt;ref name="gn(10)6"/&gt; Literary historian George Neagoe argues that this was a "public lie", as the PNP, a party of "[[fellow traveler]]s", had not truly opted to dissolve itself; it was rather "discarded by its ally".&lt;ref name="gn(10)6"&gt;Neagoe (2010), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Until March 21, 1949, all regional chapters had been dissolved, and PNP deputies resumed their seats as independents.&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaru, p. LX&lt;/ref&gt; His influence greatly reduced, Constantinescu-Iași continued to serve in the Groza governments, and was Minister of Religious Affairs in 1953;&lt;ref&gt;Petcu, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu was likewise sidelined, maintaining some of his political functions but prevented from popularizing his unorthodox interpretations of Marxist dogma and world affairs.&lt;ref name="iscastrator"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neagoe (2010), pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, he was almost arrested for "[[Enemy of the people|enemy-like behavior]]".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 331–332&lt;/ref&gt; Vlădescu-Răcoasa was also recalled from Moscow, and, assigned to minor positions, had to watch on as the regime suppressed, then confiscated, Romanian sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Rostás, in Bulgaru, pp. XIII–XIV&lt;/ref&gt; Florica Bagdasar was eliminated from political life by 1953, when she was also attacked in the press as a "[[Rootless cosmopolitan|cosmopolitan]]".&lt;ref name="abasclepios"/&gt; Instead, Oțetea accumulated accolades and, as an official historian, signaled the 1964 break with the Soviets, revealing to the public the anti-Russian pronunciations of Marxist classics.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

Several suppliant members of the Communist Party's Central Committee, down to the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], and including Levente and [[Gheorghe Mihoc]], had been activists in the original UP.&lt;ref&gt;Florica Dobre, Liviu Marius Bejenaru, Clara Cosmineanu-Mareș, Monica Grigore, Alina Ilinca, Oana Ionel, Nicoleta Ionescu-Gurã, Elisabeta Neagoe-Pleșa, Liviu Pleșa, ''Membrii C.C. al P.C.R.

He was sacked from the Securitate in 1956 for his disregard of decorum, and began a second career as a [[Centrocoop]] functionary, dying in anonymity in 1993.&lt;ref name="odfiul"/&gt;

==Doctrines==

===Functions===
The UP and PNP functioned mainly as a testing ground for the PCdR, filtering its future members and making its ideology palatable to the general public. Many scholars see the UP/PNP as mainly a front for the exceedingly minor PCdR, variously describing it as "rather decorative",&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; "something resembling a party",&lt;ref name="agvechicu"/&gt; an "electioneering vent",&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2010), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; an "organization designed to fulfill the communists' objectives",&lt;ref name="Crăciun, p. 299"/&gt; a "diversion",&lt;ref name="înobiectiv"/&gt; "instrument"&lt;ref&gt;Razi, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; or "windscreen",&lt;ref name="lb273"&gt;Boia, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; and a "quasi-party".&lt;ref&gt;Nagy &amp; Vincze, pp. 41, 61&lt;/ref&gt; Literary historian and former communist politician [[Pavel Țugui]] disagrees: with an "antifascist and antiracist program",&lt;ref name="pț(09)48"/&gt; standing for "various democratic orientations", the UP "did not form any alliances with any party whatsoever between 1942 and spring 1944."&lt;ref name="pțcronicar2"/&gt; He notes that the collaboration with the communists should be seen as one between "two distinct political and organizational entities", with the UP on the [[center-left]].&lt;ref name="pț(09)48"/&gt;

Initially, the UP itself acknowledged that it had a short-term role, presenting itself not as a party, but as a [[big tent]] movement of antifascists and PCdR members, irrespective of ethnicity, social class, or creed.&lt;ref&gt;Covaci, pp. 167–168; Moisa, p. 110; Păiușan (2010), pp. 293–295, 300&lt;/ref&gt; Members called each other ''prieten'' ("friend"), mirroring the communist ''tovarăș'' ("[[comrade]]").&lt;ref name="marna"&gt;"Intrunirile de Duminică ale Uniunii Patrioților La 'Marna'", in ''[[Scînteia]]'', August 15, 1945, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gheran, pp. 308, 311&lt;/ref&gt; In a December 1944 address to the people, Novacu presented the [[King Michael's Coup|August 23 Coup]] as top-down seizure of power, rather than as a popular revolution, which could only "impel and enrich the populace".&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2010), pp. 299&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time, Vlădescu-Răcoasa was claiming that, in the "new world", it would matter not whether "one is a bourgeois or a proletarian, but if one is a democrat". The one "true democracy", he indicated, was a [[People's democracy (Marxism–Leninism)|people's democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2010), p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that the UP was not about distributing "posts and ministries."&lt;ref name="gmoi108"/&gt;

The UP also sought to profit from the introduction of [[women's suffrage]], putting out a manifesto specifically aimed at women voters. Critical of "vain [[feminism]]", it proposed equal responsibilities for women in the effort to reconstruct Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2010), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; A female activist, Cornelia Sterian, also explained that "woman must become equal in rights, she must play an active part in the political struggle for a free and fulfilling life."&lt;ref name="rp(10)300"/&gt; A Bucharest female section had been formed by 1946, animated by Margareta Vlădescu-Răcoasa and by [[Mihail Sadoveanu]]'s wife Valeria.&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaru, pp. XLIX, LII&lt;/ref&gt;

In its later electoral manifestos, the UP called itself "a political organization in support of the people", consolidating "an independent, democratic and merry Romania",&lt;ref&gt;Dumitru Huțanu, "Aspecte privind participarea maselor populare din fostul județ Putna la evenimentele anilor 1945-1946", in ''Studii și Comunicări. Publicația Complexului Muzeal al Județului Vrancea'', Vol. III, 1980, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; emerging naturally from "the movement of resistance against the Hitlerites and the Antonescu dictatorship".&lt;ref name="rp(10)292"&gt;Păiușan (2010), p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the movement advertised a more specific corporate goal, namely "the democratization of the middle classes".&lt;ref name="rp(12)386"&gt;Păiușan (2012), p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; These were taken to include all categories between the proletariat (represented by the PCdR) and the "rich bankers, great landlords, dealers and speculators" it claimed were represented by the PNȚ and PNL; more specifically, the PNP was supposed to stand for professional workers, artisans, traders, industrialists, functionaries, pensioners, and freelancers.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2013 I), p. 510&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about the accomplished "historical mission" of 1949, George Călinescu explained that it consisted of "educating non-proletarian working strata to understand and receive the coming social order."&lt;ref name="gn(10)6"/&gt;

Reviewing such claims, Păiușan argues that the PNP's objectives interfered with those of other FND members: the Ploughmen's Front and the [[National Peasants' Party–Alexandrescu|Alexandrescu Peasantists]] existed specifically to draw in "the urban middle class."&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2013 I), pp. 506, 510&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by [[Lucian Blaga]], its putative member, the PNP manifestly failed at becoming "an independent autonomous party of the petty bourgeoisie", and was simply "a maneuverable mass".&lt;ref&gt;Blaga, pp. 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Populism and nationalism===
As noted by historian Carol Terteci, the UP shared a BPD platform of "populist promises".&lt;ref name="ct173"/&gt; Party notables took pride in asserting that the BPD's program was largely inspired by its own charter, and thus "closest to the soul of the masses."&lt;ref name="rp(12)386"/&gt; A 1945 manifesto in [[Bârlad]] called on UP members to "erect a country where there would be no more poor people on this rich a land."&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Elena Andriescu, "Industria orașelor județului Vaslui în perioada 23 August 1944—11 iunie 1948", in ''Acta Moldaviae Meridionalis. Anuarul Muzeului Județean Vaslui'', Vol. V–VI, 1983–1984, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; With its involvement in the PCdR's war on price gauging, the PNP was soon identified as an [[anti-capitalist]] force by the middle class and the industrialists, who were reticent about joining its ranks. The UP tried to dissuade their fears, assuring them that the measures were only temporary.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2012), pp. 384, 386&lt;/ref&gt; The PNȚ had some success in identifying the PNP as a front of the PCdR: PNP territorial offices complained that Nationalist Peasantist propaganda on this topic was driving away potential recruits.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2013 I), pp. 506, 510–512&lt;/ref&gt;

Păiușan describes the UP as an organization which "betrayed the country" by "turning Romanians against the anti-Bolshevik war and sealing a pact with the Soviet enemy."&lt;ref name="rp(10)292"/&gt; When addressing a Romanian public, the National Populars took on the promotion of [[left-wing nationalism]]. Party speakers argued that "the criminal fascist war" offered "an occasion for verifying one's patriotism", and held that fascists "exploited patriotic sentiment", "poisoning the soul of the people".&lt;ref name="marna"/&gt; Writing in ''Lupta Patriotică'', Novacu theorized that: "Motherland and patriotism stand for combat and sacrifice for mankind's permanent ideals. For liberty and independence, for one's language, art, for one's credo, one's bread, for our factories and our fields."&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2010), p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the UP's involvement in Northern Transylvanian regionalism, its leadership in Banat alleged that the PNȚ was only superficially and opportunistically patriotic.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2012), pp. 384–385&lt;/ref&gt; It also declared itself against [[Hungarian irredentism|Hungarian "revisionism"]]&lt;ref name="rp(12)389"/&gt; or "venomous chauvinism" in general.&lt;ref name="ebxxxviii"&gt;Bulgaru, p. XXXVIII&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Transylvanian issue was solved in Romania's favor, according to PNP sources, only because of "the unconditioned help of our great Eastern friend, the USSR, and our old friend, France."&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2012), p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

The UP and later the PNP were formally dedicated to purging the country of fascists, in particular former members of the [[Iron Guard]].&lt;ref name="înobiectiv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Covaci, pp. 193; Moisa, pp. 107–108; Țugui (2009), ''passim''. See also Enache, pp. 56, 61, 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the UP proved immediately attractive for a category of former wartime fascists, and especially for Guardist sympathizers within the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]]. Notorious examples include the Religious Affairs Minister, [[Constantin Burducea]] and Religious Affairs Undersecretary Ion Vască, whose fascist past was a tool for extortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Sorin Bocancea, [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/160/art14-Bocancea.php "Dincolo de actualele mituri. Biserica Ortodoxă în primii ani ai regimului comunist din România"], in ''[[Sfera Politicii]]'', Nr. 160, June 2011; Enache, pp. 60–61, 74, 78–80. See also Kalkandjieva, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Burducea had it that the Church was compatible with socialism, and that the FND was not "godless": "How could one hold suspicions of anti-Christian or anti-religious sentiment the FND's sincerely democratic parties, when the Front works for the brotherhood of all men, for bringing the Gospel to life within this nation, and for toppling hatred, injustice, obscurantism and social inequality?"&lt;ref&gt;Enache, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

As Burducea's patron, Constantinescu-Iași extended his protection to one other PNP sympathizer and former Guardist, the bishop [[Antim Nica]], who in turn sought to protect his colleagues by directing them into the party.&lt;ref&gt;Petcu, p. 161, 166&lt;/ref&gt; Constantinescu-Iași also negotiated with Guard representatives such as [[Petre Țuțea]] to have its members join the PCdR and the UP en masse.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcustă, pp. 61–62; Țurlea, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Other efforts involved a former high-ranking figure in the Guard, historian [[P. P. Panaitescu]], who similarly urged his former subordinates to make their way into the UP.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ilarion Țiu, [http://jurnalul.ro/scinteia/istoria-comunismului/si-verzi-si-rosii-21850.html "Și verzi, și roșii"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', May 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Putna County]], that is to say Vlădescu-Răcoasa's own fief, the PNP chapter was weakened by disputes over the fascist past of its leaders, including its local secretary, the Orthodox priest Streche.&lt;ref&gt;Miron, pp. 192, 197, 226–227&lt;/ref&gt; Other PNP members of the far-right clergy, exposed by the Workers' Party only after 1949, included a head of the clergy syndicate in [[Baia County]].&lt;ref&gt;Petcu, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, a circular letter presented to [[Teohari Georgescu]] of [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Internal Affairs]] estimated that there were 110 Guardists co-opted by the UP.&lt;ref&gt;Țurlea, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minority issues===
[[File:Primirea lui Vlădescu-Răcoasa la Tg. Mureș, 4 aug 1945.JPG|thumb|360px|Triumphal arch with Hungarian and Romanian inscriptions and symbols, erected in [[Târgu Mureș]] in honor of Vlădescu-Răcoasa. August 4, 1945]]
The UP was especially active among the [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minorities]], which were the focus of Vlădescu-Răcoasa's time in office. The PNP heralded [[denazification]] among the [[Banat Swabians]], protecting some Swabians who, it claimed, were wrongly prosecuted by the [[Romanian People's Tribunals|People's Tribunals]], while targeting others who supported the anti-communist opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2012), pp. 388–390; (2013 I), pp. 505–506&lt;/ref&gt; Its relationship with the [[Hungarians in Romania|ethnic Hungarians]] was more tense, despite official rhetoric encouraging cooperation: the UP's [[Bihor County]] cell divided itself into competing cells, representing the region's ethnic groups, and was sabotaged by its MADOSZ allies. In February 1945, it voted to bar Hungarians from joining its ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, pp. 300–308; Moisa, pp. 111–112, 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;

The communists also experimented by creating a parallel, UP-modeled, organization of [[Armenians in Romania|Armenian Romanians]]. Called Union of Armenian Patriots (or Armenian Front), it drew Armenians away from the anti-Soviet [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaktsutyun]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucian Nastasă, "Studiu introductiv", in ''Armenii din nord-vestul Transilvaniei în anii instaurării comunismului (1945-1953). Mărturii documentare'', Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Center, Cluj-Napoca, pp. 17–22.  {{ISBN|978-973-7670-08-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar body existed for exiled [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republicans]], who voted Vlădescu-Răcoasa as their honorary president.&lt;ref name="ebxxxviii"/&gt;

The PNP had a more ambiguous stance concerning the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] and [[Romani people in Romania|Romani]] communities, which had been the victims of deportation and murder during the Holocaust.  During the Antonescu years, UP founder Manuilă had in fact come up with the project to deport Jews and Romanies into [[Transnistria Governorate|occupied Transnistria]], singling them out as "stateless" communities.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report'', p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; When this had been enforced, however, he had protected some 5,000 Jews, keeping them in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the UP participants in Patriotic Antihitlerite meetings argued that: "The Jewish group must have its own commission to allow the Jews to take care of purely Jewish issues."&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, at official commemorations, PNP activists downplayed the historical impact of episodes such as the [[Iași pogrom]] of 1941, noting that, "other than the minor misunderstandings that are inherent to life in common, one can say that [Jews] have been fully embraced by their friends, the Romanian people."&lt;ref&gt;Gușu, pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in February 1946, the communist politico [[Vasile Luca]] set his PNP partners the goal of attracting as many as possible from the 150,000 Jewish voters still living in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;"Documente. Ședința resortului central al organizației de masă din 21 februarie 1946 (Comitetul Democratic Evreiesc)", in Andreea Andreescu, Lucian Nastasă, Andreea Varga, ''Minorităţi etnoculturale. Mărturii documentare. Evreii din România (1945-1965)'', Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Center, Cluj-Napoca, 2003, p. 217.  {{ISBN|973-85738-4-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vlădescu-Răcoasa clashed with the [[Zionism|Zionists]] when, in November 1944, he announced that Jews would not be recognized as a distinct minority, but instead [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] into their group of choice.&lt;ref&gt;Hildrun Glass, "Câteva note despre activitatea iui Avram L. Zissu", in Liviu Rotman, Camelia Crăciun, Ana-Gabriela Vasiliu (eds.), ''Noi perspective în istoriografia evreilor din România'', [[Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania]] &amp; [[Editura Hasefer]], Bucharest, 2010, pp. 164–165&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factionalism and divergence===
Even in its late years, PNP officials expressed a "belief in the eternal life of the Romanian Monarchy."&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2012), p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; This resolution passed into its statues, where "the recognition of the Monarchy" was one of the core ideas.&lt;ref name="ebxliii"&gt;Bulgaru, p. XLIII&lt;/ref&gt; Although it adopted a pro-Soviet policy that Păiușan sees as "treasonous",&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2010), pp. 292, 300&lt;/ref&gt; the UP included, at its original core, supporters of the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]] such as Bagdasar and Ivașcu.&lt;ref name="pțcronicar2"/&gt; The Bagdasars worked closely with American officials in the [[Allied Commission]], and were upset that Romania was prevented from joining the [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref name="abasclepios"/&gt;

Beyond its national representation and its trans-ethnic agenda, the PNP remained a minor and recessive force. As noted by Corneliu Crăciun, it was always less powerful than the [[Patriotic Defense]],&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; a workers' aid organization also gravitating around the PCdR, and also organized as a paramilitary wing.&lt;ref name="ecc872"/&gt; The UP's 1944 recruitment drive in Bihor, which was still nominally held by a [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|rump Hungarian state]], only managed some 200 enlistments, of which 150 were inactive members. Only 40 card-carrying members still existed in 1945, after Hungarians and Jews were expelled from the party.&lt;ref&gt;Moisa, pp. 108–109, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in [[Cluj County]], the UP was preferred by Romanian communist sympathizers, with the PCdR section dominated by Hungarians.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lakatos, "Partidul Comunist Român din Cluj în 1945", in ''Studia Universitatis Babeș-Bolyai. Historia'', Nr. 1–2/2010, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; In Putna, the UP only mustered some 1,700 members in all (compared to the 6,000 enlisted with the Alexandrescu Peasantists, but well ahead of the PCdR's 400).&lt;ref&gt;Miron, pp. 194, 227&lt;/ref&gt; The Timiș-Torontal section, presided over by General [[Teodor Șerb]], had some 2,000 to 2,500 members, the majority of whom were male peasants, with no representation for women and youth.&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2012), pp. 383–384, 387–388; (2013 II), pp. 955–956, 963–964&lt;/ref&gt;

As a corollary of its dependence on the PCdR, the party was heavily infiltrated by communist cells—the PCdR's own circulars commended the Putna cell as highly "dynamic".&lt;ref&gt;Miron, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; In Bihor, the UP was directly managed by a communist envoy, Imre Tóth.&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, p. 304; Moisa, pp. 110–112&lt;/ref&gt; These policies divided the party. Some in the PNP struggled to maintain the party's independence, insisting on its independent status, "with equal rights within the Bloc of Democratic Parties". In 1946, the [[Severin County]] chapter unanimously passed a resolution ruling the communists' transgressions as "inadmissible and impolite".&lt;ref name="rp(12)386"/&gt;

The PNP also reported on abuses committed by paramilitary "citizens' guards", which, it implied, were terrorizing the populace,&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2013 I), p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; while activists such as Bagdasar expressed bafflement over the anti-Peasantist rhetorical violence.&lt;ref name="abasclepios"/&gt; In early 1946, Călinescu and ''Națiunea'' demanded a "purge of the purgers", that is to say a toning down of repression against political undesirables.&lt;ref name="înobiectiv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esdamnarea"/&gt; Father Burducea's unwavering support for their activities alienated the clergy, many of whom resented and mocked him; this matter contributed to his sacking.&lt;ref&gt;Enache, pp. 64–73&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the BPD as an authoritarian instrument, members deserted in significant numbers during 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Păiușan (2013 II), pp. 956–958&lt;/ref&gt; and some even became involved with a group of [[Romanian anti-communist resistance movement|anti-communist partisans]], formed by [[Gheorghe Arsenescu]] in [[Muscel County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Radu Petrescu, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/haiducii-muscelului-miscarea-rezistenta-colonelului-gheorghe-arsenescu "''Haiducii Muscelului'', mișcarea de rezistență a colonelului Gheorghe Arsenescu"], in ''Historia'', February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[Unix]] variants, "'''nobody'''" is the conventional name of a [[user account]] which owns no files, is in no privileged groups, and has no abilities except those which every other user has. Some systems also define an equivalent group "'''nogroup'''".

== Uses ==

* The pseudo-user "nobody" and group "nogroup" are used, for example, in the [[NFSv4]] implementation of Linux by [[idmapd]], if a user or group name in an incoming packet does not match any known username on the system.
* It was once common to run [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]]s as ''nobody'', especially [[server (computing)|server]]s, in order to limit the damage that could be done by a malicious user who gained control of them. However, the usefulness of this technique is reduced if more than one daemon is run like this, because then gaining control of one daemon would provide control of them all. The reason is that processes owned by the same user have the ability to send signals to each other and use [[debugging]] facilities to read or even modify each other's memory.  Modern practice, as recommended by the [[Linux Standard Base]], is to provide better security isolation by creating a separate user account for each daemon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Linux Standard Base]], [http://refspecs.linux-foundation.org/LSB_3.1.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/usernames.html Core Specification 3.1 section 21.2: User &amp; Group Names], linux-foundation.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Queensland Labor Party''' (QLP) was a political party of [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] formed in 1957 by a breakaway group of the then ruling [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|Labor Party]] Government after the expulsion of Premier [[Vince Gair]]. In 1962 the party became the Queensland section of the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]] (DLP). The party continued to hold seats in the Queensland state parliament until 1972, then suffered a collapse in its vote and wound itself up in 1978.

==History==
In Queensland, [[Vince Gair]] became Labor leader and premier in 1952.&lt;ref name=ANU_AustralianDictionaryofBiographyOnline_VincentGair&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Central Executive of the ALP expelled Gair on 24 April 1957 because of his support of the [[Industrial Groups|Groupers]].&lt;ref name="ANU_AustralianDictionaryofBiographyOnline_VincentGair" /&gt; A total of 25 Labor [[Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly|MLAs]] left the party with him, including all the Cabinet except Deputy Premier [[Jack Duggan (politician)|Jack Duggan]], to form the Queensland Labor Party. The two ex-Labor Independents joined the QLP. The ALP was left with 23 members with Duggan as leader. The [[National Party of Australia – Queensland|Country]] and [[Liberal Party of Australia (Queensland Division)|Liberal]] Parties had a combined 24 seats.

Gair tried to gain Country Party support for his [[minority government]], but talks with [[Frank Nicklin]] broke down when federal Country Party leader [[Arthur Fadden]] told Nicklin that he had a chance to become Premier himself.&lt;ref name=ANU_AustralianDictionaryofBiographyOnline_VincentGair/&gt; On 12 June, the ALP, now led by Duggan, voted to deny "[[Government budget|supply]]" (that is, the money needed to govern) to what was left of the Gair government. The Country-Liberal Coalition moved to block supply as well and brought the government down.&lt;ref name=Mines&gt;Frank Mines (1975), ''Gair'', Canberra City, ACT, Arrow Press. {{ISBN|0-909095-00-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A [[Queensland state election, 1957|state election]] was called for 3 August 1957. At that time, Queensland had a unicameral parliament which was elected by [[first-past-the-post]] rather than the present [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] system.  Since all sitting ALP and QLP members were opposed by a candidate from the other faction, the Labor vote was split in many seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/house-divided-left-labor-disarray/story-e6frg6zo-1111114063686 |title=House divided left Labor disarray |publisher=Theaustralian.com.au |date=2007-07-30 |accessdate=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Coalition actually suffered a small swing against it, the large number of three-cornered contests resulted in the ALP and QLP losing seats to the Coalition. The two Labor factions won only 31 seats between them to the Coalition's 42 (up from 24 previously). The QLP won 23.4% of the vote, second behind Labor, and 11 of the 75 seats. Nicklin became Premier and for the first time in 25 years and only the second time since 1915, a Labor Government was out of office in Queensland. Gair himself was reelected in South Brisbane.

At the [[Queensland state election, 1960|1960 state election]], the QLP won only four seats, with even Gair losing his seat. Gair stood for the Senate in 1961 for the QLP, but was unsuccessful. Gair's QLP merged with the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]] (DLP) in 1962 to become the Queensland branch of the DLP.&lt;ref name=Mines /&gt; However this decision split the state parliamentarians with two, [[Bunny Adair]] and [[Ted Walsh (politician)|Ted Walsh]], opposing joining the DLP and instead becoming independent members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=D. B. Waterson |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/walsh-edward-joseph-ted-11951 |title=Edward Joseph (Ted) Walsh |publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography |date= |accessdate=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Queensland state election, 1963|1963 state election]] preferential voting was reintroduced. This enabled the DLP to not only draw votes away from the ALP, but also to direct their preferences to the Coalition. Gair became federal DLP leader in 1964,&lt;ref name="ANU_AustralianDictionaryofBiographyOnline_VincentGair"/&gt; after his election to the Senate. From the 1963 election, the party's support in Queensland slipped below 8%, and the party retained only one seat in Queensland's unicameral parliament. The party's electoral support remained at about that level until the [[Queensland state election, 1972|1972 election]] when its last seat was lost in a redistribution. The DLP lost its raison d'être after 1972 when Labor won office at the federal level. At the time the [[National Party of Australia – Queensland|state Country Party]] explored a merger with the DLP as part of a strategy of seeking greater unity with groups opposed to the federal Labor government, but this plan was soon abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Colin A. |date=1980 |title=The Government of Queensland |publisher=University of Queensland Press |page=19 |isbn=978-0702215155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DLP went into further decline in 1974 when Gair was forced to resign from the party as a result of the so-called [[Gair Affair]]. At the [[Queensland state election, 1974|1974 state election]], the DLP did not contest all seats, and recorded only 1.91% of the vote. The DLP did not contest the [[Queensland state election, 1977|1977 state election]] and ceased to exist in 1978. 

The ALP would remain in opposition in Queensland, even after the QLP and its successor the DLP had ceased to exist, returning to government in 1989 with [[Wayne Goss]] as leader.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6293">A '''rump state''' is the remnant of a once much larger [[State (polity)|state]], left with a reduced [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] in the wake of [[secession]], [[annexation]], [[military occupation|occupation]], [[decolonization]], or a successful [[coup d'état]] or [[revolution]] on part of its former territory.&lt;ref&gt;Tir, J.: [http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/7/2/0/5/p72056_index.html Keeping the Peace After Secessions: Territorial Conflicts Between Rump and Secessionist States]. Paper presented 2005-2-22 at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, Hilton Hawaiian Village, Honolulu, Hawaii Online. Retrieved 2014 Oct 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, a government stops short of going into [[government in exile|exile]] because it still controls part of its former territory. For example, after the [[Qing Empire]] assumed control over most of China, the previous [[Ming Empire]] turned to resistance in the [[Southern Ming|south]] as a rump state until its [[Qing conquest of the Ming|eventual conquest]].

== Land raid ==
By 1948 Knoydart was under the ownership of [[Ronald Nall-Cain, 2nd Baron Brocket|Lord Brocket]], who was controversial for his fascist activities. His estates were used for entertaining supporters of [[Germany]] and Brocket became a committed member of the [[Anglo-German Fellowship]], and known in society as a [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathiser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=David|title=Parliamentary Debates|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo980605/debtext/80605-20.htm|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As veterans of the [[Second World War]], they had been fighting to defend Britain against the fascist regimes in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and elsewhere. The seven men marked out {{convert|65|acres|hectare}} of arable land and {{convert|10,000|acres|hectare}} of hill land upon which to settle.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;

The raid followed a pattern set by the [[Highland Land League]] some seventy years before, and inspired by similar land-raids at the end of the [[Great War]] on [[Raasay]] and the [[Long Isle]], when returning soldiers drew public attention to the misuse and mismanagement of land.&lt;ref name=PS/&gt;

Although the raiders had public opinion on their side, Lord Brocket succeeded in obtaining a court order to remove them.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt; The raiders' case was heard and rejected by a [[Court of Enquiry]] called by the government early in 1949. An appeal by the men to the [[Secretary of State for Scotland|Secretary of State]] also failed.&lt;ref name=PS/&gt;

A cairn commemorating the land raid was erected at [[Inverie]] in 1991, by the Knoydart Land Raid Commemoration Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, J.S. (1999) ''Maverick Guide to Scotland'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=55ZaYPD-g10C&amp;lpg=PA506&amp;dq=%22seven%20men%20of%20knoydart%22%20memorial&amp;pg=PA506#v=onepage&amp;q=%22seven%20men%20of%20knoydart%22%20memorial&amp;f=false] Pelican Publishing. {{ISBN|1455608661}} Retrieved March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The plaque reads:
:: ''Justice!''
:: ''In 1948 near this cairn the Seven Men of Knoydart staked claims to secure a place to live and work.''
:: ''For over a century Highlanders had been forced to use land raids to gain a foothold where their forebears lived. Their struggle should inspire each new generation of Scots to gain such rights by just laws.''
:: ''History will judge harshly the oppressive laws that have led to the virtual extinction of a unique culture from this beautiful place.'' &lt;ref&gt;Scott, A.

== Legacy ==
The reign of absentee landlords in Knoydart came to an end in the 1980s, when Surrey property dealer [[Phillip Rhodes (Property dealer)|Phillip Rhodes]] acquired the estate and began selling off sections. The last 17,000 acres were bought by Jute manufacturing company [[Titaghur]], and when the company went into [[receivership]] the land was acquired by the [[Knoydart Foundation]] in a community led [[Community buyout|buy-out]].&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2673">The '''Signed and Encrypted Email Over the Internet''' ('''SEEOTI''') initiative is an approach to providing [[small and medium enterprises]] with the ability to communicate securely with one another, government defence ministries and major aerospace and defence contractors, allowing them to play a full part in the defence supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Carl | last = Billson | title=Signed, sealed and delivered: making email secure | url=http://www.ukceb.org/RWFilePub.php?cat=429&amp;dx=1&amp;ob=3&amp;rpn=catviewleafpublic429&amp;id=105189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

SEEOTI implements the secure email specifications defined by the Transglobal Secure Collaboration Program ([[Transglobal Secure Collaboration Project|TSCP]]).  These support interoperable signing and encryption of email messages in a federated environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=TSCP description | url=http://www.asd-ssg.org/tscp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the security labelling of email messages is supported with a network border [[Guard (information security)|guard]] being able to check labels even though messages are encrypted. This meets the goal of protecting [[Intellectual Property]] in the global business environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Email in security hot seat with rise of cloud, BYOD | url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/711847/email-in-security-hot-seat-with-rise-of-cloud-byod }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is of particular importance to the UK Cyber Security Strategy as intellectual property is seen as key to the growth of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Jacqui | last=Griffiths | title=Doing More for Less | url=http://digital.onwindows.com/touch/2012/spring/index.html#/35/zoomed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deep-Secure]] organised a trial of SEEOTI for [[UK MoD|UK MOD]] and the [[UK Cyber Security Community#UKCeB|UK Council for Electronic Business]]. This integrated Commercial Off The Shelf ([[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]]) products from TITUS, [[Boldon James]] and Deep-Secure to provide the system's email security functionality. Deep-Secure were selected as the overall winner of the UKCeB Excellence Awards 2011 for their work on SEEOTI in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The 3rd UKCeB Good Practice Marketplace &amp; Excellence Awards &amp; Special HFI Award - 2012 |url=http://www.adsgroup.org.uk/articles/28483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep-Secure and its partners Adept4, Intercede and Trustis are providing a SEEOTI solution as a service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Intercede, Deep-Secure and adept4 partner to launch secure email service | url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/4/prweb9432822.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nexor]] provide compatible products.

Debates between the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] and other groups were of particular importance in bringing the party case to an outside audience without the sometimes off-putting rhetoric of platform speaking, or the one-sidedness of educational talks. A prime instance of this importance for the party is the case of Richard Headicar, a former [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] speaker, won over after debating with the party. Of rather wider historical importance were the debates with the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1944)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] in the late 1940s. In the course of these Sammy Cash persuaded the RCP’s [[Jock Haston]] of the [[state capitalist]] nature of the [[Soviet Union]]. The idea was then relayed to [[Tony Cliff]], from which it formed the genesis of the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]].

Debates were not a major part of [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] propaganda until the 1930s, reliance being instead put on outdoor speaking, particularly at established street corner venues (as can be seen, debates at outdoor venues were not however unknown). The Indian Summer of SPGB debating was clearly in the 1980s, with a range and number never previously seen. In the last ten years debating has virtually ceased to be an element of SPGB propaganda.

It was in fact the only Marxist group in Britain (in Germany, the Communist Party of Germany engaged in such debates) that would share a platform to debate against those from the [[far right]] such as Probyn, Goulding and Raven Thompson from the [[British Union of Fascists]] and [[Denis Pirie]] from the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]].

It may be noted that until the 1970s at least, debates, like lectures and talks, were primarily held in the winter months. Although obviously skewed towards [[London]], it is obvious just how concentrated in the capital SPGB activity has been.

== List of debates ==
This is not a full list since many debates, particularly in the early years, went unreported in the ''[[Socialist Standard]]'', the main source of information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16906">[[File:Stafford Hospital Overview.jpg|thumb|Stafford Hospital now renamed County Hospital]]
The '''Stafford Hospital scandal''' concerns poor care and high mortality rates amongst patients at the [[County Hospital, Stafford|Stafford Hospital]], [[Stafford]], England, in the late 2000s. The hospital was run by the [[Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust]], and supervised by the [[West Midlands Strategic Health Authority]]. It has been renamed [[County Hospital, Stafford|County Hospital]].

== Background ==
Julie Bailey, whose mother died in her home, in 2007, started a campaign called Cure the NHS to demand changes in the hospital.  She was supported by the [[Staffordshire Newsletter]], but the [[Public and Patient Involvement Forum]] and the Governors of the Trust were defensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Staffordshire hospital scandal: the hidden story|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/5030012/Staffordshire-hospital-scandal-the-hidden-story.html|accessdate=1 January 2014|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=22 March 2009|location=London|first=Patrick|last=Sawer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandal came to national attention because of an investigation by the [[Healthcare Commission]] in 2008 into the operation of [[County Hospital, Stafford|Stafford Hospital]] in [[Stafford]], England. The commission was first alerted by the "apparently high mortality rates in patients admitted as emergencies".&lt;ref name=HCReport&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/_db/_documents/Investigation_into_Mid_Staffordshire_NHS_Foundation_Trust.pdf|title=Investigation into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust|publisher=Healthcare Commission |date=March 2009|isbn=978-1-84562-220-6|accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the [[Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust]], which is responsible for running the hospital, failed to provide what the commission considered an adequate explanation, a full-scale investigation was carried out between March and October 2008.&lt;ref name=HCReport /&gt; Released in March 2009, the commission's report severely criticised the [[NHS Foundation Trust|Foundation Trust]]'s management and detailed the appalling conditions and inadequacies at the hospital. Many press reports suggested that because of the substandard care between 400 and 1200 more patients died between 2005 and 2008 than would be expected for the type of hospital,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/5008935/NHS-targets-may-have-led-to-1200-deaths-in-Mid-Staffordshire.html |title=NHS targets 'may have led to 1,200 deaths' in Mid-Staffordshire |author=Rebecca Smith (Medical Editor) |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=18 March 2009 |accessdate=9 November 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mirror&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/03/18/up-to-1-200-may-have-died-over-shocking-patient-care-at-stafford-hospital-115875-21206422/ |author=Emily Cook |title=Stafford hospital scandal: Up to 1,200 may have died over "shocking" patient care |publisher=Daily Mirror |date=March 18, 2009 |accessdate=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on figures from a mortality model, but the final Healthcare Commission report concluded it would be misleading to link the inadequate care to a specific number or range of numbers of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How many people died "unnecessarily" at Mid Staffs|url=https://fullfact.org/factchecks/francis_many_deaths_unnecessarily_at_mid_staffs-28805|website=Full Fact|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HC375&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/sites/default/files/report/Volume%201.pdf |title=Independent Inquiry into care provided by Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust January 2005 – March 2009 |chapter=Volume I, Section G: Mortality statistics |page=352 |author=Robert Francis QC |publisher=The Stationery Office |date=24 February 2010 |id=HC375-I |isbn=978-0-10-296439-4 |accessdate=9 November 2010 |quote=it has been concluded that it would be unsafe to infer from the figures that there was any particular number or range of numbers of avoidable or unnecessary deaths at the Trust.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An independent 2008 study into hospital standardised mortality ratios found that this measure, as developed by the Dr Foster Unit at Imperial College, is prone to methodological bias, and that it was not credible to claim that variation in mortality ratios reflects differences in quality of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b780|title=Evidence of methodological bias in hospital standardised mortality ratios: retrospective database study of English hospitals|first1=Mohammed A.|last1=Mohammed|first2=Jonathan J.|last2=Deeks|first3=Alan|last3=Girling|first4=Gavin|last4=Rudge|first5=Martin|last5=Carmalt|first6=Andrew J.|last6=Stevens|first7=Richard J.|last7=Lilford|date=18 March 2009|publisher=|journal=BMJ|volume=338|pages=b780|via=www.bmj.com|doi=10.1136/bmj.b780|pmid=19297447|pmc=2659855}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[The Guardian]] amended an article from 2013:&lt;blockquote&gt;...subsequent investigations into the poor care at Stafford hospital, including the two reports by Sir Robert Francis QC, said that this disputed estimate, which appeared only in a draft report from 2009 by the Healthcare commission and was based on mortality statistics, was an unreliable measure of avoidable deaths.

Some executives who had been responsible for the trust at the time received promotions within the health service and were loudly criticised.  [[Cynthia Bower]], who was from 2006 chief executive of [[NHS West Midlands]], was recruited to run the [[Care Quality Commission]] [[quango]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/5007652/Stafford-Hospital-execs-land-higly-paid-jobs.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Rebecca | last=Smith | title=Stafford Hospital execs land {{sic|nolink=y|higly-paid|expected=highly-paid}} jobs | date=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sir [[David Nicholson (civil servant)|David Nicholson]] was in charge of the regional health authority responsible for the hospital at the height of the failings between 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir David Nicholson quits: NHS chief steps down in wake of Mid Staffs scandal|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sir-david-nicholson-quits-nhs-chief-steps-down-in-wake-of-mid-staffs-scandal-8625889.html|accessdate=22 November 2013|newspaper=Independent|date=21 May 2013|location=London|first=Oliver|last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2009, the [[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Andy Burnham]], announced a further independent inquiry into care provided by Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust.&lt;ref name=bbc-20090721&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/8160385.stm |title=Fresh inquiry at failing hospital |publisher=BBC |date=21 July 2009 |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The generally critical inquiry report was published on 24 February 2010. The report made 18 local and national recommendations, including that the regulator, [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]], de-authorise the [[NHS Foundation Trust|Foundation Trust]].&lt;ref name=francis-report&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_113018|title=Robert Francis Inquiry report into Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust|author=Robert Francis QC|publisher=House of Commons|date=24 February 2010|isbn=978-0-10-296439-4|accessdate=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-20100224&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/24/mid-staffordshire-hospital-inquiry |title=Mid Staffordshire NHS trust left patients humiliated and in pain |author=Sarah Boseley |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 February 2010 |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compensation payments averaging £11,000 were paid to some of the families involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/oct/31/mid-staffordshire-nhs-trust-compensation |title=NHS trust pays compensation to victims of 'appalling' patient care |work=Press Association |publisher=The Guardian |date=31 October 2010 |accessdate=31 October 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Burnham agreed to a further independent inquiry of the commissioning, supervisory and regulatory bodies for Foundation Trusts.&lt;ref name=francis-report /&gt;

== Public inquiry ==

In June 2010, the new government announced that a full [[public inquiry]] would be held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/5264078/Death-rates-victory-after-Stafford-scandal.html |title=Public inquiry into scandal-hit Stafford Hospital |author=Nick Triggle |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=9 June 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inquiry began on 8 November 2010 chaired by [[Robert Francis (barrister)|Robert Francis QC]], who had chaired the fourth inquiry which he had criticised for its narrow remit. The inquiry considered more than a million pages of previous evidence as well as hearing from witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11696735 |title=Stafford Hospital public inquiry opens |publisher=BBC |date=8 November 2010 |accessdate=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK expert medical lawyers also offered their assistance to distraught and angry families who waited for proof that lessons had been learned. Many families of the victims felt that crucial questions have been left unanswered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irwinmitchell.com/newsandmedia/2013/january/familys-anger-as-they-are-left-waiting-for-proof-that-lessons-are-learnt|last=Dixon|first=Rob|date=13 January 2013|publisher=Irwin Mitchell|accessdate=10 July 2013|location=Sheffield|title=Family’s Anger At Being Left Waiting For Proof That Lessons Are Learnt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final report was published on 6 February 2013, making 290 recommendations.&lt;ref name=bbc-20130206&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21341766 |title=Stafford Hospital: Hiding mistakes 'should be criminal offence' |author=Nick Triggle |publisher=BBC |date=6 February 2013 |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=francis-report-2013&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/report |title=Report of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry. |author=Robert Francis QC |publisher=House of Commons |isbn=978-0-10-298147-6 |date=6 February 2013 |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academics at the [[University of Oxford]] and [[King's College London]] have criticised its recommendations to legally enforce a new duty of openness, transparency and candour amongst NHS staff, arguing that increasing 'micro-regulation' may produce serious unintended consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Press Release|title=Study on clinical risk controls in the NHS|url=http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/newsandevents/releases/Pages/ClinicalRiskControls.aspx|work=Said Business School, University of Oxford|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revelations of the neglect to patients at Stafford hospital were widely considered to be deeply shocking by all sections of the mainstream UK press; for example, patients were left in their own urine by nurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8801249/Boss-of-scandal-hit-hospital-escapes-cross-examination.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first1=Patrick | last1=Sawer | first2=Laura | last2=Donnelly | title=Boss of scandal-hit hospital escapes cross-examination | date=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Actions against nurses ==

The [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] (NMC), the UK’s regulator of nurses and midwives, has held hearings about nurses working in the trust following allegations that they were not fit to practise. Acting to protect the public, the NMC has struck off from their register and suspended 2 nurses as a result of these hearings.

This includes two nurses who falsified accident and emergency discharge times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-23450764 | work=BBC News | title=Stafford nurses struck off over waiting times | date=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; two nurses involved in the death of a diabetic patient&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-24174040 | work=BBC News | title=Nurse struck off for Stafford Hospital death | date=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a nurse who physically and verbally abused a dementia patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9870691/Mid-Staffs-midwife-struck-off-but-still-employed-as-a-carer.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Hayley | last=Dixon | title=Mid Staffs midwife struck off, but still employed as a carer | date=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swedish Fortifications Agency (SFA)''' ({{lang-sv|Fortifikationsverket}}, abbreviated {{lang|sv|FortV}}) is a [[Government agencies in Sweden|Swedish government agency]] under the [[Ministry of Finance (Sweden)|Swedish Ministry of Finance]] ({{lang|sv|Finansdepartementet}}), tasked with managing [[government-owned]] defense-related buildings and land.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOF_ordinance|Ministry of Finance 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; The agency functions as the [[landlord]] for the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] ({{lang|sv|Försvarsmakten}}), managing various types of [[military installation]]s.&lt;ref name="MOF_web_agencies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Holmstrom|Holmström 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; The SFA is one of the largest holders of [[real estate]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name="MOF_web_agencies"/&gt;

==Function in the government==
The formation of the SFA in 1994 was part of the Swedish government effort to increase the cost-efficiency of government real estate usage through a system of [[internal rent]], which was meant to emulate [[market-like]] conditions.&lt;ref name="Statskontoret_2004"&gt;[[#Statskontoret_2004|Swedish Agency for Public Management 2004]], p. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose with the reform was to create economic incentives for the authorities in the public sector to economise on premises.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lind_2005|Lind 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the defense sector, the real estate holdings were transferred from the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] — the user of the real estate — to the SFA; with the Swedish Armed Forces remaining in the estate as a tenant.&lt;ref name="Statskontoret_2004"/&gt;

Currently, the SFA acts as [[landlord]] for several Swedish government agencies in the defense sector.&lt;ref name="SFA_yf2007_p12"&gt;[[#SFA_yf2007|Swedish Fortifications Agency 2007]], p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The main tenant is the Swedish Armed Forces, which in 2007 was the source of over 90% of the SFA:s [[revenue]].&lt;ref name="SFA_yf2007_p12"/&gt;

==Economy==
The SFA does not receive an allowance from the [[government budget]].&lt;ref name="MOF_regulation_p5"&gt;[[#MOF_regulation|Ministry of Finance 2009]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it covers its expenses by charging [[renting|rent]] for the real estate it leases.&lt;ref name="MOF_regulation_p5"/&gt; In 2008, the agency's [[revenue]] was 3.0 billion [[Swedish Krona|SEK]], and its [[net income]] 67 million SEK.&lt;ref name="SFA_ar2008_p38"/&gt; The rent is adjusted so that the net income — which goes into the state [[treasury]] — conforms to a predefined level of [[return on equity]], as set by the [[Ministry of Finance (Sweden)|Ministry of Finance]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOF_regulation|Ministry of Finance 2009]], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; To finance [[investment]]s, the SFA borrows money from the [[National Debt Office (Sweden)|National Debt Office]] ({{lang|sv|Riksgälden}}), which acts as the internal bank of the government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOF_2003|Ministry of Finance 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The SFA employed 689 people in 2008.&lt;ref name="#SFA_ar2008"/&gt; The majority of the employees work on a local level in real estate units linked to [[garrison]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[[#SFA_ar2008|Swedish Fortifications Agency 2008]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; where employees work in areas such as [[project management]], [[property development]] and [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance services]].&lt;ref name="SFA_web_english"&gt;[[#SFA_web|Swedish Fortifications Agency]]: {{cite web |url=http://www.fortv.se/templates/PageWide.aspx?id=62 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828060713/http://www.fortv.se/templates/PageWide.aspx?id=62 |archivedate=2009-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the regional and national level, employees work in real estate purchasing and sales, defense facility development, and various management functions.&lt;ref name="SFA_web_english"/&gt; The SFA considers its [[core competencies]] to be security and protective technology.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SFA_ar2008|Swedish Fortifications Agency 2008]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The agency has stated that it aims to increase the amount of [[outsourcing]], and as an experiment in 2006, it outsourced the property maintenance of two [[garrison]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SFA_afr2007|Swedish Fortifications Agency 2007]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real estate stock==
In 2008, the [[book value]] of the government real estate stock managed by the SFA was 10.1 billion [[Swedish krona|SEK]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#SFA_ar2008|Swedish Fortifications Agency]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; largely consisting of depots, [[garrison]]s, training facilities, offices, and [[proving ground]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SFA_yf2007|Swedish Fortifications Agency 2007]], pp. 18, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the total real estate stock included:&lt;ref&gt;[[#SFA_web|Swedish Fortifications Agency]] {{cite web |url=http://www.fortv.se/templates/Page.aspx?id=470 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708235603/http://www.fortv.se/templates/Page.aspx?id=470 |archivedate=2007-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5288">Technology for Peace is a Cyprus-based peoples' initiative launched in 1995 to serve the needs of peace pioneers on the divided island.

==History==
The peace portal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mirror.undp.org/cyprus/projects/project_details.asp?ProjectID=105 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724203325/http://mirror.undp.org/cyprus/projects/project_details.asp?ProjectID=105 |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was born because it was deemed needed. What led to its birth was neither the availability of relevant technology nor the availability of funding, because both were not there. The ban of bi-communal meetings imposed by the Turkish Cypriot Authorities following the EU’s decision to postpone accession negotiations with Turkey (summit meeting in Luxembourg, December 1997) stopped face-to-face dialogues (during the time window 1994-1997) and threatened to nullify all peace building efforts on the island. The idea came out of several (# 9, 10 &amp; 11) of the 15 peace promoting projects, which made it to the final [[Cyprus_Conflict_Resolution_Trainers_Group#Cyprus_Peace_Bazaar|Cyprus Peace Bazaar]] organized by the [[Cyprus Conflict Resolution Trainers Group]] in 1995.

==Tech4Peace vision==
The vision, which underpinned the project Technology For Peace (Tech4Peace) was to enhance in Cyprus
one of the most basic human rights, the right of communication, by applying modern technology in the service of peace with emphasis on the usage of Internet and Internet-based applications. A promising and creative way to enhance inter-communal communication where there exist substantial hindrances to direct contact between peoples is through the use of the Internet. Cyberspace and Internet provide an efficient, fast, tractable, confidential, organized, time and space independent means of communication. As individuals and organizations throughout the world continue to demonstrate, the Internet can overcome the challenge posed by physical separation, whether due to geographic, political or other reasons, by effectively moving discourse into "cyberspace."

==Activities==
The Tech4Peace team organized a series of trainings in the usage of the net to communicate across the dividing line in the years 1996-1998. In 1998, with USAID funding given to Dr. [[Hrach Gregorian]], cyber peace cafes on the northern and southern parts of Nicosia have been set up within CYBER KIDS centers, from where peace builders could communicate with their peers on the other side. Participants were also exposed to the ICONS project&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icons.umd.edu ICONS Project&lt;/ref&gt;, developed at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], using simulations and scenario-driven exercises to advance their understanding of complex problems and strengthen their ability to make decisions, navigate crises, think strategically, and negotiate collaboratively. In the next years, the project team developed theory of how technology in general can serve bridge the divides,&lt;ref&gt;Laouris, Y. and Laouri, R. (2008). Can Information and mobile technologies serve close the economic, educational, digital and social gaps and accelerate development? World Futures, 64(4), 254-275.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as how technology can support the ethical engagement of all stakeholders in a dialogue which concerns their own futures&lt;ref&gt;Laouris, Y., Laouri, R. and Christakis, A. (2008). Communication praxis for ethical accountability; The ethics of the tree of action. Syst Res Behav Sci 25(2), 331–348.&lt;/ref&gt;
.

==Contributions==
The Tech4Peace project has been evaluated by Nathan Associates &lt;ref&gt;Nathan Associates, FINAL REPORT, CYPRUS BI-COMMUNAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM EVALUATION. Prepared for the United States Agency for International Development. IQC No. AEP-I-00-00-00023-00. Evaluation team: Richard Blue (Team Leader), Vivikka Molldrem, Craig Webster, Alejandro Gonzales, Mine Yucel, Yiorghos Leventis&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[United States Agency for International Development]] as a project that has contributed towards Peace and Reconciliation in Cyprus. It was one of few projects, which received support multiple times and were funded by the [[UNOPS]], [[United Nations]] funding scheme during the very first funding cycle.

==Founding members==
The Tech4Peace project was founded as one of the selected [[Cyprus_Conflict_Resolution_Trainers_Group#Cyprus_Peace_Bazaar|Cyprus Peace Bazaar]] Projects in 1997. The members of the founding team were [[Yiannis Laouris]], [[Harry Anastasiou]], Dervis Besimler and Bekir Azgin. They were all members of the [[Cyprus Conflict Resolution Trainers Group]].

This article is a list of major figures in the theory of [[libertarianism]], a philosophy asserting that individuals have a right to be free. Originally coined by French anarchist [[Joseph Déjacque]] as an alternative to anarchism, in the 1950s American classical liberals decided to appropriate the term to for their philosophy which asserts that individuals have a right to acquire, keep, and exchange their holdings and that the primary purpose of government is to protect these rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vallentyne|first1=Peter|title=Libertarianism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/|website=Stanford|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Libertarian thinkers==
* [[Lao Zi]] (571 BC - 471 BC): According to Murray N. Rothbard himself, Lao Zi was the first Libertarian, given Lao Zi’s contempt for those in power and so for the state.
* [[Étienne de La Boétie]] (1530–1563): French judge, writer, and "a founder of modern political philosophy in France."
* [[Josiah Warren]] (1798–1874): Inventor, social theorist, and believer in "individual sovereignty." Influenced [[John Stuart Mill]]. States "commit more crimes upon persons and property than all criminals put together."&lt;ref name=RadCap/&gt;
* [[Frédéric Bastiat]] (1801–1850): French classical liberal theorist, political economist, author of ''[[The Law (book)|The Law]]''.
* [[Adin Ballou]] (1803–1890): American Christian anarchist.&lt;ref name=RadCap/&gt;
* [[William Lloyd Garrison]] (1805–1879): American abolitionist libertarian and journalist. Influenced [[Frederick Douglass]], ex-slave and anti-slavery crusader.&lt;ref name=RadCap/&gt;
* [[Lysander Spooner]] (1808–1887): American abolitionist, lawyer, entrepreneur, and individualist anarchist theorist. Author of ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'' and ''[[No Treason]]''.
* [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865): French socialist thinker, first person to call themselves an Anarchist.
* [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]] (1812–1886): Abolitionist who tried to sell Texas to Britain to prevent it becoming a slave state.&lt;ref name=RadCap/&gt;
* [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814-1876): Russian revolutionary Anarchist
* [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817-1862) : Advocate of minimal or no government, and civil disobedience against the authoritarian state.
* [[Joseph Déjacque]] (1821-1864): French communist-anarchist, first person to coin the term "libertarian" in its modern sense.
* [[Gustave de Molinari]] (1819–1912): French liberal economist and author of ''The Production of Security'' in which he argued that security can be produced better through the market than through government monopoly policing.
* [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903): Anarchist British parliamentarian. Advocated the "right of people to ignore the state." &lt;ref name=RadCap&gt;Doherty, ''Radicals for Capitalism''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Auberon Herbert]] (1838–1906): Anarchist British parliamentarian, founder of "[[voluntaryism]]" and anti-democrat. Advocated that the voting majority has no more right to decide a man's life than "either the bayonet-surrounded emperor or the infallible church."&lt;ref name=RadCap/&gt;
* [[Henry George]] (1839-1897): American political economist and journalist, author of "[[Progress and Poverty]]" (1879), "Social Problems" (1883), and "Protection or Free Trade" (1886). Advocated for protecting the common right of all to Nature, free trade, and the secret ballot, among other ideas seminal to modern libertarianism. His ideas form the basis for [[Georgism]] and [[Geolibertarianism]], and are additionally considered as formative for beginning the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States.
* [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842-1921): Russian anarchist, one of the key thinkers of anarchist-communism.

The '''Western Political Science Association''' (WPSA) is a [[professional association]] of [[political science]] scholars and students in the [[United States]] that was founded in 1947.
 
== Aims ==
The purpose of the WPSA is to promote the study and teaching of government and politics, to foster political research, and to facilitate a greater dialogue involving public affairs and policy making. The official region of the WPSA includes the western states of [[Alaska]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Hawaii]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oregon]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. In addition, it includes the Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]], and [[Saskatchewan]]. However, one-third of the association’s members are from other states and nations.&lt;ref name="csus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csus.edu/org/wpsa/ |title=WPSA Home Page |accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The WPSA was founded in November, 1947, and held its first meeting at the [[University of Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/106591295600900202 |title=The Western Political Science Association: The First Ten Years and the Next Ten |year=1956 |last1=Durham |first1=G. H. |journal=Political Research Quarterly |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time a constitution was adopted and officers were elected for the new organization. The first president of the association was [[G. Homer Durham]] ([[University of Utah]]). The WPSA was the second regional political science association formally recognized by the [[American Political Science Association]]. In 1995, the WPSA became incorporated in [[California]] as a nonprofit public benefit corporation. In 1998, the WPSA Executive Council appointed Elizabeth Moulds from [[California State University Sacramento]] to serve as the association's first Executive Director. Including her term as Executive Director, Moulds served as the chief administrative officer for the association for 25 years, before stepping down in 2009.

== Annual meeting ==
The WPSA Annual Meeting is a gathering of political scientists that rotates throughout the region. It occurs over a weekend in March or April each spring. Approximately 1,100 to 1,300 political scientists participate in this conference annually. The conference provides a forum for scholars to share research, discuss political science education, and network with other experts in their field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csus.edu/org/wpsa/mtgs.stm |title=WPSA: Annual Meeting |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Worshipful Company of Cordwainers''' is one of the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]]. [[Cordwainer]]s were workers in fine leather; the Company gets its name from "cordwain" ([[Leather#Cordwain.2C .22Cordovan.22 or .22Spanish leather.22|cordovan]]), the white leather produced from [[goatskin (material)|goatskin]] in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Cordova]], [[Spain]]. All fine leather makers, including [[Worshipful Company of Girdlers|Girdlers]] and [[Worshipful Company of Glovers|Glovers]], were originally classified as cordwainers; however, the term eventually came to refer only to fine leather [[footwear]], including [[boot]]s.

The Cordwainers' Company, which received the right to regulate City trade in 1272 (the same year as the [[Worshipful Company of Curriers|Curriers]]), obtained a [[Royal Charter]] of incorporation in 1439. The status of the Company as a trade association has lessened over the years;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/artliverycos.htm City Livery Companies]&lt;/ref&gt; the Company is now, as are most other Livery Companies, a charitable body. Other leather-linked Livery Companies, which enjoy close relations with the Cordwainers include not only the [[Worshipful Company of Curriers|Curriers]], but the [[Worshipful Company of Leathersellers|Leathersellers]], [[Worshipful Company of Saddlers|Saddlers]] and [[Worshipful Company of Tallow Chandlers|Tallow Chandlers]] Companies too.

The Company ranks twenty-seventh in the [[order of precedence]] of Livery Companies and is the highest ranked one without its own Livery Hall. The Company's [[motto]] is ''Corio et Arte'', [[Latin]] for ''Leather and Art''.

The [[livery hall]] of the Cordwainers, [[Cordwainers' Hall]], stood near St. Paul's Churchyard from 1316 until its destruction in the [[London blitz]] in 1941.&lt;ref name="Melling2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Kennedy Melling|title=London's Guilds and Liveries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6eBkp6zZ9UC&amp;pg=PA54|year=2003|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-0-7478-0559-5|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
