[[Image:Volleyball9 block.jpg|thumb|200px|A triple block in a game of 9-man volleyball]]
'''9-man''' (also nine-man, nineman, 9man) is a volleyball team sport utilizing nine players per side and a slightly larger court (10 by 20 meters). Historically, the sport was played by Chinese immigrants to the US, who predominantly hailed from [[Toisan]] ([[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]]) city in Guangdong province of China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ursula/9-man-a-streetball-battle-in-the-heart-of-chinatow&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s the sport was used as a means to socially connect the laborers in Chinatowns across the United States.  Teams from Boston and Providence, RI held the first organized nine-man tournament in 1938 which later spread to Chinatowns in other large US and Canadian cities.&lt;ref name="latitudenews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nehamas|first=Nicholas|title=Chinese-Americans find community, slam dunks in "street" volleyball|url=http://www.latitudenews.com/story/chinese-americans-find-community-slam-dunks-in-9-man-volleyball/|accessdate=29 January 2013|newspaper=Latitude News|date=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North American version of 9-Man continues to grow today with a popular rotating tournament called the [[NACIVT]] &lt;ref name="latitudenews" /&gt; uniting thousands of players and spectators each September over [[Labor Day]] weekend. It is unclear whether the sport was also played in the [[Asian Games]] in 1958 and in 1962 held in Tokyo and Jakarta, respectively, or if they were simply playing volleyball with nine players. The sport has not made a reappearance in the Asian Games since, and many believe that the rules of nine-man are exclusive to the community that plays in North America. The sport is the subject of an award-winning documentary called [http://www.9-man.com/about 9-Man] that was completed in 2014 and had its world premiere at [[IFFBoston]] on April 27, 2014 at 1pm.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2986300/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://prod1.agileticketing.net/websales/pages/info.aspx?evtinfo=80000~05cb9704-bfe5-4d73-aeb6-44c19bbac1a2&amp;epguid=d516d018-d5c6-406e-aa8d-3f2b68b26e23&amp;&lt;/ref&gt; The film was broadcast on the PBS [[World Channel]] series [[America ReFramed]] on May 5, 2015.

NACIVT rules stipulate that at any given time, each team must have at least six players of "100 percent" Chinese descent on the court. The
remaining three players must be of Asian descent; the NACIVT explicitly states who qualifies as Asian based on the country of origin of his ancestors - (Asian: origins from: Myanmar (formerly Burma), Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam). In addition, only men are allowed to play 9-man.&lt;ref name="latitudenews" /&gt;

==Rules==
There are a number of ways in which 9-man rules differ from traditional [[Volleyball]] rules. As only men can play 9-man, during international tournaments, such as the [[NACIVT]], women play by six-player [[Volleyball]] rules.

'''Rotating:''' Players in 9-man do not rotate as in traditional volleyball. As such, players tend to specialize in two or three positions.&lt;ref name="livestrong.com"&gt;http://www.livestrong.com/article/102710-9man-volleyball-rules/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serving:''' Only 3 players are allowed to serve per team, it may be any 3 players. Teams must rotate servers. The players may serve from any position behind the line. Jump serves are not allow as one foot must remain on the ground while serving.&lt;ref name="livestrong.com"/&gt;

'''Scoring:''' 9-man implements a rally scoring system. Teams do not have to be serving in order to win a point. The first team to 21 points while holding a lead of at least two points is the winner. If there is no two-point lead, the first team to 25 points wins.&lt;ref name="livestrong.com"/&gt;

'''Touch Limit:''' Each team is allowed three touches before the ball must be sent over the net to the opposing team. A block counts as a touch. A team is awarded an additional touch if the ball contacts the net during a volley. The other team is awarded a point if the ball comes into contact with any body part besides the arms and hands.&lt;ref name="livestrong.com"/&gt;

'''Blocking:''' You can not penetrate across the plane of the net (called "piking"). Blocks must be straight up. If the ball comes into contact with your head, the play goes to the other team.

'''Ball Handling:''' There are several specialized moves in traditional nine-man. The preferred method of passing the ball is called a chai ball—an underhand scooping move. The fai-gok or fastball is typically the centermost position in the offense that has a signature move resembling a basketball dunk. The player pushes the ball upward and then quickly changes the direction of the ball slamming it to the ground. A net ball (pushing the ball into the net so that it rebounds and you can play it again) is often performed by the setter to upset the timing and rhythm of the game and throw off the defense.

'''NACIVT Rules:''' [[NACIVT]] rules stipulate that at any given time, each team must have at least six players of "100 percent" Chinese descent on the court. The remaining three players must be of Asian descent.

==Tournaments==
The North American Chinese Invitational Volleyball Tournament ([[NACIVT]]) is held every [[Labor Day]] weekend and features men's 9-man volleyball and women's 6's volleyball teams. The tournament is generally held outdoors and played on pavement, with the courts typically set-up in a large parking lot or even on the streets.  Because of changes in climate the tournament can also be held indoors (ex: Convention Centers.)  It is very much a cultural phenomenon; two-thirds of the players on each team must be 100% Chinese, and the rest must be of Asian descent.  The inaugural [[NACIVT]] tournament was held in Boston in 1944.  Today there are teams representing [[Boston]], [[Maryland]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[North Carolina]], [[Houston]], [[Montreal]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[San Francisco]], [[San Diego]], [[Toronto]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]. In 2009, a team from [[Shanghai]] was invited to participate in the Los Angeles NACIVT, and the players who were only familiar with six-person volleyball played with 9-man rules for the first time.

Each year there are also mini tournaments held in Toronto, New York City, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco leading up to the annual NACIVT.

The New York Mini hosted by the New York Strangers, is one of the biggest tournaments leading up to the Labor Day weekend Nationals. It is held in Seward Park in Chinatown, averaging about 80 teams per year. Generally it is held in Mid-July with teams participating from Boston, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, Toronto, Montreal and North Carolina.

The [[August Moon]] tournament is played every August in Boston at Reggie Wong &lt;ref&gt;http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2011/04/07/reggie_wong_everyones_uncle_in_chinatown_68/&lt;/ref&gt; Memorial Park (formerly Pagoda Park)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2Yc9jHYE1k&lt;/ref&gt;  in Chinatown on Kneeland Street. This tournament features 9-man teams from the Boston area including the Boston Chinese Freemasons, Boston Knights, and the Boston Hurricanes.

Toronto typically hosts a mini tournament during [[Canada Day]] in which teams from Toronto and Montreal play.&lt;ref&gt;http://veenix.blogspot.com/2007/07/canada-day-9-man-tournament-day-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The 69th NACIVT was hosted in Washington, D.C. over the 3-day 2013 Labor Day weekend.&lt;ref&gt;dc.nacivt.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The 70th NACIVT was hosted by San Francisco teams in Las Vegas over the 2014 Labor Day weekend.

The 71th NACIVT was hosted in New York over the 2015 Labor Day weekend.

The 72th NACIVT was hosted in Los Angeles over the 2016 Labor Day weekend.

The 73rd NACIVT was hosted in Fort Lauderdale over the 2017 Labor Day weekend.

The 74th NACIVT was hosted in Montreal over the 2018 Labor Day weekend.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="754">An '''ACS bolt''' (also known as an anti-chop system) is a special type of [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] used in some [[Paintball marker]]s. The purpose of the ACS bolt is to reduce the amount of chopping (when a paintball is pinched by the forward motion of the bolt, causing it to break) by using a system that detects when there is an obstruction in the chamber and brings the bolt back. [[Tippmann]] has a similar system on their model line called [[Tippmann#A.C.T.|A.C.T., or "Anti-Chop Technology"]].

The '''Afghanistan Cricket Board''' ({{lang-ps|{{Nastaliq|د افغانستان کريکټ بورډ}}}}, {{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|کریکت بورد افغانستان}}}}; formerly '''Afghanistan Cricket Federation''')  is the official [[www.Sport governing body|governing body]] of the sport of [[cricket in Afghanistan]]. Its current headquarters is in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]].

The Afghanistan Cricket Board is Afghanistan's representative at the [[International Cricket Council]] and was an associate member of ICC from June 2013 to 2017.Now it is one of the full members of ICC since 2017. Before that it was an affiliate member and has been a member of that body since 2001. It is also a member of the [[Asian Cricket Council]].

[[President of Afghanistan|Afghan President]] [[Ashraf Ghani]] is the patron-in-chief of the board.

On 11 November 2010, the Afghan national women's cricket team was formed. This was to help females understand the game of cricket and have a parallel team to that of the men. Also policy states that as per [[Islamic tradition]] women can wear a headscarf or [[hijab]] which is their own choice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espncricinfo.com/afghanistan/content/story/486563.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, ACB unveiled a strategic plan and set targets for [[Afghanistan national cricket team|Afghanistan]] to be a top-six ODI team by 2019 and a top-three team in both T20Is and ODIs by 2025.&lt;ref name="ACB Plan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/video_audio/1033913.html|title=Afghanistan Cricket Target|publisher=[[ESPN Cricinfo]]|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve this, ACB created a proposal to be presented to [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]], in the works to secure annual bilateral matches against India and teams touring India beginning next year.&lt;ref name="ACB Proposal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/afghanistan/content/story/1033997.html
|title=Afghanistan Cricket Proposal to BCCI|publisher=[[ESPN Cricinfo]]|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shafiq Stanikzai, Chief Executive of ACB, said the draft had been presented to BCCI president Anurag Thakur in May and further discussions had happened during the ICC Annual Conference in Edinburgh in June, 2016.

==History==

[[Cricket]] was first played in Afghanistan during the 19th century [[First Anglo-Afghan War|Anglo-Afghan War]]s, with [[British Raj|British]] troops reported has having played in [[Kabul]] in 1839. However, unlike many countries, no lasting cricket legacy was left by the British, and it would be more than a hundred years before cricket returned.&lt;ref name="ACC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiancricket.org/index.php/members/afghanistan|title=Profile of Afghanistan|publisher=[[Asian Cricket Council]]|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, cricket became popular amongst [[Afghans in Pakistan|Afghan refugees in Pakistan]], and the Afghanistan Cricket Federation was formed there in 1995. They continued to play cricket on their return to their home country in late 2001.&lt;ref name="ACC" /&gt; Like all sports, cricket was originally banned by the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban]], but it became an exception in 2000 and the Afghanistan Cricket Federation was elected as an affiliate member of the ICC the following year.&lt;ref name="TL"&gt;[http://www.cricketeurope4.net/CRICKETEUROPE/GENERAL/TIMELINES/afghanistan.shtml Timeline of Afghanistan cricket] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921043117/http://www.cricketeurope4.net/CRICKETEUROPE/GENERAL/TIMELINES/afghanistan.shtml |date=21 September 2012 }} at CricketEurope&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Afghanistan national cricket team]]'s 21-run win over [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]] in Krugersdorp earned them official [[One Day International]] status in April 2009. The team qualified for the [[2012 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup]].

On 22 June 2017, [[Afghanistan national cricket team|Afghanistan]] was granted [[Test cricket|Test nation status]] by the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]]. This was the first time in history that two teams earned [[Test cricket|test status]] at the same time. Afghanistan share this honour with [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]], thus bringing the number of total number of test playing nations to twelve. On 14 June 2018,they played their first test match against [[India national cricket team|India]], which they lost within two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/40364481|title=Ireland &amp; Afghanistan awarded Test status by International Cricket Council|date=2017-06-22|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2017/06/22/ireland-afghanistan-eligible-play-test-cricket-becoming-11th/|title=Ireland and Afghanistan granted Test status after becoming 11th and 12th full ICC members|last=Hoult|first=Nick|date=2017-06-22|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-08-24|last2=Association|first2=Press|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/19705648/afghanistan-ireland-get-test-status|title=Afghanistan, Ireland get Test status|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic competitions==

Afghanistan's domestic structure consists of a 25-[[over (cricket)|over]] Inter-Provincial Tournament, which has the participation of 22 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provinces]] in the tournament. The aim of the tournament is to spread the game across the country and to generate a greater depth of talent for the national team to select from. The best players from the tournament would be selected players for [[Afghanistan-A cricket team|Afghanistan-A]] and [[Afghanistan U-19 cricket team|under-19]] teams based on their performance and would be sent for training and coaching to [[Bangladesh]]. Afghanistan teams often visit [[Pakistan]]. Currently Afghanistan A team is [[Afghanistan A tour of Pakistan in 2013|visiting Pakistan]].

Two teams from the 12-team first round will advance to the next round. The top six from the tournament will then contest Afghanistan's main domestic event - a 50 over tournament in [[Kabul]] in May 2010. The 50 over tournament was won by [[Kabul Province cricket team|Kabul Province]].

Starting in 2011, Afghanistan's domestic cricket structure has grown. The expanded Inter-Provincial Tournament was reorganized into a 50 over tournament and divided into a Challenge Cup section (the [[Etisalat ODN Challenge Cup]]&lt;ref name="Etisalat ODN Challenge Cup 2013"&gt;[http://www.cricket.af/page.aspx?Page=2 Afghanistan Cricket Board - Etisalat ODN Challenge Cup 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; with 20 provincial teams) and an Elite Cup section (with 12 provincial teams; 4 of them qualifiers from the Challenge Cup section).&lt;ref name="Provincial ODN Challenge And Elite Cup 2011"&gt;[http://www.cricket.af/page.aspx?Page=11 Afghanistan Cricket Board - Provincial ODN Challenge And Elite Cup 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Inter-Provincial cricket the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) has divided the provinces of Afghanistan in to 5 Cricket Regions to enable the better management of the game. The Regions are Amo in the north (centered on Balkh), Spin Ghar in the east (centered on Nangarhar), Band-e-Amir in the centre (centered on Kabul), Mis Ainak in the southeast (centered on Khost), and Boost in the west and southwest (centered on Kandahar).&lt;ref name="About Domestic Cricket"&gt;[http://www.cricket.af/page.aspx?Page=8 Afghanistan Cricket Board - About Domestic Cricket]&lt;/ref&gt; The 5 regions in turn have representative teams which play in all traditional 3 formats of cricket; the [[Ahmad Shah Abdali One-Day Tournament]], [[Ahmad Shah Abdali T20 Tournament]]&lt;ref name="Ahmad Shah Abdali One Day and T20 Tournaments Report"&gt;[http://www.cricket.af/page.aspx?Page=9 Afghanistan Cricket Board - Ahmad Shah Abdali One Day and T20 Tournaments Report]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ahmad Shah Abdali Three-Day Tournament]].&lt;ref name="Ahmad Shah Abdali Three days Regional Tournament 2011"&gt;[http://www.cricket.af/page.aspx?Page=10 Afghanistan Cricket Board - Ahmad Shah Abdali Three days Regional Tournament 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to an expansion of the inter-provincial tournament from 25-over matches to 50-over matches and the addition of the T-20 and multi-day formats, cricket in Afghanistan has now expanded across the provinces as well; 32 of the 34 provinces now have representatives sides&lt;ref name="Where do Afghanistan go next?"&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/678293.html Cricinfo Magazine - Where do Afghanistan go next?]&lt;/ref&gt; All provinces except [[Daykundi]] and [[Farah, Afghanistan|Farah]] have a representative team, while the ACB recognizes Afghan Refugees&lt;ref name="Afghan Refugees cricket team"&gt;[http://www.cricket.af/team.aspx?ID=1&amp;team=Afghan Afghanistan Cricket Board - Team: Afghan Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt; and Kochain&lt;ref name="Kochain cricket team"&gt;[http://www.cricket.af/team.aspx?ID=1&amp;team=Kochain Afghanistan Cricket Board - Team: Kochain]&lt;/ref&gt; as provincial teams. There are also plans to expand the three-day league competition into a four-day league in 2014.&lt;ref name="Where do Afghanistan go next?"/&gt;

The UAE-based telecommunications company, [[Etisalat]] is now one of the main sponsors of Afghanistan's cricket, including being the then title sponsor in Afghanistan's division 2 inter-provincinal challenge cup and the [[Etisalat Sixes T20 Tournament]]. Which is now sponsored by Afghan company called "Alokozay" [[Shpageeza Cricket League]].

==Cricket Grounds in Afghanistan==

{{Main article|List of cricket grounds in Afghanistan}}
[[File:Jalalabad stadium in June 2011.jpg|thumb|The [[Sherzai Cricket Stadium]] in [[Jalalabad]] is under construction as seen in this June 2011 image.]]
The Afghan national cricket team does not play its home matches inside Afghanistan due to the ongoing security situation and the lack of international standard facilities. Afghanistan played their 'home' Intercontinental Cup fixture against Ireland at the [[Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium]] in [[Sri Lanka]].

'''Canada Games Stadium''' is a multi-purpose, fully lit stadium in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], [[New Brunswick]].

It was built on the campus of [[University of New Brunswick#Saint John|UNB Saint John]] for the [[Canada Games|1985 Canada Summer Games]] and has a [[seating capacity]] of 5,000 spectators.

Canada Games Stadium features a 400m synthetic rubberized track surface, as well as separate areas for [[long jump]]/[[triple jump]], [[high jump]], [[pole vault]], [[Discus throw|discus]], [[Hammer throw|hammer]], [[shot put]], and [[Javelin throw|javelin]]. Inside the track is a synthetic turf [[Football (soccer)|soccer]]/[[Canadian football|football]] field.

In 2009 the stadium received $3.6 million in upgrades, including resurfacing the track, placing synthetic turf on the infield, the creation of an area for throwing events, grand stand renovations, infield lighting installation, a scoreboard, security lighting and perimeter fencing, and a new storage area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unb.ca/capitalplanning/projects/canadagames.html UNBSJ Canada Games Stadium to be upgraded]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides hosting university and minor sports, the Canada Games Stadium has hosted national track &amp; field events; international soccer matches (including matches during the [[1987 FIFA U-16 World Championship]]), and two [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] [[Touchdown Atlantic|pre-season football games]] (with temporary seating added) in 1986 and 1987. In 2012 the stadium hosted the [[NCCWMA &amp; CMA Masters Track &amp; Field Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nccwma2012.com/# |title=Saint John 2012 Official Website |access-date=2013-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614223420/http://nccwma2012.com/# |archive-date=2013-06-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''center''' ('''C'''), also known as the '''five''', or the '''big man''', is one of the five [[Basketball position|positions]] in a regular [[basketball]] game. The center is normally the tallest player on the team, and often has a great deal of strength and body mass as well. In the [[NBA]], the center is usually 6' 10" (2.08 m) or taller and usually weighs 240 lbs (109 kg) or more. They traditonally have played close to the basket in the [[low post]]. A center with the ability to shoot outside from [[three-point field goal|three-point range]] is known as '''stretch five'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Dan|title=Five out: NBA entering era of 3-point-shooting centers|date=April 17, 2017|work=Pro Basketball Talk|url=https://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/04/17/five-out-nba-entering-era-of-3-point-shooting-centers/|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History of the center position==
===Emergence of the center and the era of George Mikan===
[[File:GeorgeMikan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|George Mikan]]
The center is considered a necessary component for a successful team, especially in professional leagues such as the NBA. But recently, the NBA has turned into a point guard league and many centers are shooting threes now. Great centers have been the foundation for most of the dynasties in both the NBA and NCAA. The 6'10" (2.08 m) [[George Mikan]] pioneered the Center position, shattering the widely held perception that tall players could not develop the agility and coordination to play basketball well, and ushering in the role of the dominant big man. He led [[DePaul University]] to the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] title, then, after turning professional, won seven [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]], [[Basketball Association of America]] and [[NBA Championship]]s in his ten-year career (1946–56), nine of them with the [[Minneapolis Lakers]]. Using his height to dominate opposing players, Mikan invented the [[hook shot]] and the [[block (basketball)|shot block]]; as a consequence, the NCAA, and later NBA, adopted the [[goaltending]] rule, and, in 1951, the NBA widened the foul lane, a decision known as the 'Mikan rule'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/finals/Mikan_v_Knicks.html|title=NBA.com: George Mikan vs. The Knicks|website=www.nba.com|access-date=2007-06-25|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67qhnZHXS?url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/finals/Mikan_v_Knicks.html#|archive-date=2012-05-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centers in the 1960s: The era of Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain===
[[File:Wilt Chamberlain Bill Russell.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bill Russell (left) and Wilt Chamberlain (right)]]
In the 1960s, [[Bill Russell]] and [[Wilt Chamberlain]] further transformed basketball by combining height with a greater level of athleticism than previous centers. Following the retirement of [[George Mikan]], the rivalry of the two big men came to dominate the NBA. Between the two of them, Chamberlain and Russell won nine of the eleven [[NBA Most Valuable Player|MVP]] awards in the eleven-year period between 1958 and 1969; played against one another in six Eastern Conference Finals and two NBA Finals between 1959 and 1969. Many of the records set by these two players have endured today. Most notably, Chamberlain and Russell hold [[List of National Basketball Association top individual rebounding season averages|the top eighteen season averages for rebounds]].

[[Bill Russell]] led the [[San Francisco Dons|University of San Francisco]] to two consecutive [[NCAA Men's Basketball Division I Championship|NCAA Championship]]s (1955, 56). He joined the [[Boston Celtics]] and helped make them one of the greatest dynasties in NBA history, winning eleven championships over his thirteen-year career (1956–69) as well as five MVP awards. Russell revolutionized defensive strategy with his shot-blocking, rebounding and physical [[man-to-man defense]]. While he was never the focal point of the Celtics offense, much of the team's scoring came when Russell grabbed defensive rebounds and initiated [[fast break]]s with precision outlet passes, primarily to [[point guard]] [[Bob Cousy]].  As the NBA's first African-American superstar, Russell struggled throughout his career with the racism he encountered from fans in [[Boston]], particularly after the 1966–67 season, when he became the first African-American in any major sport to be named [[player-coach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonsportsreview.com/200707_story_cover.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009064738/http://www.bostonsportsreview.com/200707_story_cover.asp |archivedate=2007-10-09 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

His principal rival, [[Wilt Chamberlain]], listed at 7'1" (2.15 m), 275 pounds (124&amp;nbsp;kg), lacked Russell's supporting cast. Chamberlain played college ball for the [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas Jayhawks]], leading them to the 1957 title game against the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]]. Although the Jayhawks lost by one point in triple overtime, Chamberlain was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Briefly a member of the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] before joining the [[Philadelphia Warriors]] of the NBA in 1959, Chamberlain won two Championships, in 1967 with the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and 1972 with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], although his teams were repeatedly defeated by the Celtics in the Eastern Conference and NBA Finals. He also won seven scoring titles, eleven rebounding titles, and four regular season [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] awards, including the distinction, in 1960, of being the first rookie to receive the award. Stronger than any player of his era, he was usually capable of scoring and rebounding at will. Although he was the target of constant double- and triple-teaming, as well as fouling tactics designed to take advantage of his poor free-throw shooting, he set a number of records that have never been broken. Most notably, Chamberlain is the only player in NBA history to average more than 50 points in a season and [[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game|score 100 points in a single game]] (both in 1961–62 as a member of the [[Philadelphia Warriors]]). He also holds the NBA's all-time records for rebounding average (27.2), rebounds in a single game (55),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/season/19611962.html|title=NBA.com: Wilt Scores 100, Averages 50|website=Nba.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[List of National Basketball Association career rebounding leaders|career rebounds]] (23,924).

A lesser-known center of the era was [[Nate Thurmond]], who initially played the forward position opposite [[Wilt Chamberlain]] for the [[San Francisco Warriors]] but moved to center after Chamberlain was traded to the new Philadelphia franchise. Although he never won a Championship, Thurmond was known as the best [[pick and roll|screen]] setter in the league, and his averages of 21.3 and 22.0 rebounds per game in 1966–67 and 1967–68, are exceeded only by Chamberlain and Russell.

===Centers in the 1970s and 1980s: The era of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar===
[[File:Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]
In contrast to the Celtics dynasty of the 1960s, the 1970s were a decade of parity in the NBA, with eight different champions and no back-to-back winners. At the college level, the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA Bruins]], under Coach [[John Wooden]], built the greatest dynasty in NCAA basketball history, winning seven consecutive titles between 1967 and 1973. UCLA had already won two consecutive titles in 1964 and 1965 with teams that pressed and emphasized guard play.  After not winning in 1966, Wooden's teams changed their style when [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Lew Alcindor]] became eligible.  He led UCLA to three championships-in 1967, 68' and 69'-while winning the first [[Naismith College Player of the Year]] Award. During his college career, the NCAA enacted a ban on dunking primarily because of Alcindor's dominant use of the shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836963,00.html | work=Time | title=Basketball: Lew's Still Loose | date=1967-04-14 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His entrance into the NBA with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in 1969 was timely, as Bill Russell had just retired and Wilt Chamberlain was 33 years old and increasingly plagued by injuries. After leading the Bucks to the 1971 NBA championship, teamed up with legendary [[Point guard]] [[Oscar Robertson]], Alcindor, who had converted to [[Islam]], changed his name to [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. In 1975, Abdul-Jabbar was traded to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], and, after the arrival of [[Point guard]] [[Magic Johnson]] in 1980, formed part of a new Lakers dynasty that won five NBA titles (1980, '82, '85, '87, '88). In addition, Abdul-Jabbar won six regular-season MVP awards (1971, '72, '74, '76, '77, '80). At 7'2" (2.18 m), 235 pounds (106&amp;nbsp;kg), he lacked the strength of Chamberlain in his prime, but had a longer wingspan and ultimately proved more durable, adhering to a strict physical-fitness regime that enabled him to play for twenty years, the longest career in NBA history at the time. Offensively, he was best known for his trademark 'Skyhook' hook-shot, almost impossible to block because of his height and wingspan. His career record of 38,387 points has yet to be broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/abduljabbar_bio.html|title=NBA.com: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Bio|website=Nba.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defensively, the 1973–74 season was the first in which the number of blocked shots were kept, and, over the next seven years, Kareem led the league in this statistic or finished second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/abdulka01.html|title=Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Stats - Basketball-Reference.com|website=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another product of John Wooden's UCLA program, [[Bill Walton]], appeared poised to join the ranks of great centers. He led UCLA to back-to-back NCAA titles in 1972 and 1973, he also led the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] to the NBA championship in 1977, and won the NBA MVP the following year. However, his career was plagued with injuries, most infamously a broken bone in his left foot suffered during his MVP season that he never fully recovered from, and he spent most of the following decade on the bench, although he eventually did win a second NBA title as a backup for the [[Boston Celtics]] in 1986, when he received the [[NBA Sixth Man Award|Sixth Man Award]]. [[Willis Reed]] won two championship with the [[New York Knicks]] in 1970 and 1973, teamed with Point guard [[Walt Frazier]]; although undersized for the center position at 6'9", he had the strength to play inside, was a highly skilled jump shooter, and was effective at setting [[pick and roll|pick]]s, a key element in the Knicks motion-oriented offense. The undersized but scrappy [[Dave Cowens]], drafted at the recommendation of Bill Russell, helped the [[Boston Celtics]] win two more NBA titles, in 1974 and 1976.

Leading centers of the late 1970s and early 1980s include [[Wes Unseld]] of the [[Washington Wizards|Baltimore/Washington Bullets]], [[Artis Gilmore]] of the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] [[Kentucky Colonels]], [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[San Antonio Spurs]]; [[Moses Malone]] of the [[Houston Rockets]] and [[Philadelphia 76ers]]; [[Mark Eaton (basketball)|Mark Eaton]] of the [[Utah Jazz]] and [[Robert Parish]] of the [[Boston Celtics]], who was acquired from the [[Golden State Warriors]] in [[1980–81 NBA season|1980]] for the top overall pick in the NBA Draft. Unseld led the Bullets to four NBA finals appearances and one championship, in 1978. Using his strength and determination to compensate for his lack of size (6'7", i.e. 2.00 m), he was famous for his rebounding, shotblocking, and bone-jarring picks. [[Artis Gilmore]], often overlooked because of the mediocrity of his teams, established himself as the best low-post scorer in the league. He set the NCAA Division I record for career average in rebounds (25.2) at tiny [[Jacksonville University]], and enjoyed an illustrious [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] career before joining the NBA's Chicago Bulls in 1976, playing there until he was traded to San Antonio in 1982, for whom he played until his retirement in 1987. He remains the NBA's career leader in field goal percentage (minimum 2000 shots made) with a 59.9 percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/gilmore_summary.html|title=NBA.com: Artis Gilmore Summary|website=Nba.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malone, the first high school player to turn professional, was drafted by the [[Houston Rockets]] after several years in the ABA, and won two MVP Awards and led Houston to its first NBA Finals in 1981, before joining the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], where, teamed with [[Julius Erving]] and [[Bobby Jones (basketball, born 1951)|Bobby Jones]], he won an NBA Championship in 1983, as well as a third League MVP. Never a dominant defender, his quickness and tenacity made him one of the best rebounders in NBA history, particularly on the offensive end; he led the league in rebounds six times in a seven-year period and still holds the NBA record for offensive rebounds.

In the mid-1980s, the 7'4" (2.23 m) Eaton was the most prolific shot-blocker in the league, and, although never a major offensive contributor, won two [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]s while helping transform the lowly [[Utah Jazz]] into a playoff contender. Of all these players, none enjoyed the success of [[Robert Parish]], who, with forwards [[Larry Bird]] and [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], formed the legendary frontcourt of the [[Boston Celtics]] team that won three titles (1981, 1984 and 1986). The Celtics' fierce rivalry with the Lakers dominated the NBA during the decade and helped basketball reach an unprecedented level of popularity. Nicknamed "Chief" after a character in the film ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' because of his stoic demeanor, Parish was known for his trademark arching jump-shot—leading many experts to consider him the best medium-range shooting center of all time{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}—and his ability to finish fast-breaks with his surprising speed. Playing until the age of 43, Parish broke Abdul-Jabbar's record for career games played.

===Centers in the 1990s===
[[File:Hakeemsigningautocropped.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hakeem Olajuwon]]
Coach [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]], once a seldom-used backup to [[Bill Russell]] with the Celtics, developed the [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown Hoyas]] into a chief pipeline for talent at the Center position, producing a succession of great defensive big men in [[Patrick Ewing]], [[Dikembe Mutombo]] and [[Alonzo Mourning]]. In 1984, Georgetown, led by Patrick Ewing, defeated the [[University of Houston]], led by [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], to win the NCAA championship. 

The [[Nigeria]]n-born Olajuwon was drafted by the [[Houston Rockets]] and paired with [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Ralph Sampson]] in what was dubbed the 'Twin Towers' duo. In his second season, 1985–86, the Rockets upset the Lakers in the Western Conference finals. Olajuwon established himself as a dominant player, leading the Rockets to two consecutive NBA championships in 1994 and 1995. In the 1993–94 season he became the only player in NBA history to win the NBA's [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] (MVP), [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year|Defensive Player of the Year]], and [[NBA Finals MVP|Finals MVP]] awards in the same season. Defensively Olajuwon broke Abdul-Jabbar's career record for blocked shots. Offensively, he was best known for his 'Dream Shake', a series of fakes and spin moves regarded as the pinnacle of big man footwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/allstar2006/program_olajuwon.html|title=It Was All A Dream|website=Nba.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ewing, from [[Jamaica]] by way of the [[Greater Boston|Boston area]], was drafted by the [[New York Knicks]] in 1985, with whom he spent fifteen of his seventeen seasons in the NBA. An eleven-time All Star, Ewing was one of the best shooting centers in NBA history, possessing a baseline jump-shot, as well as being a formidable shot blocker and rebounder. The Knicks were formidable opponents of the [[Chicago Bulls]] dynasty in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Ewing's successor as the starting center at Georgetown, [[Dikembe Mutombo]], who played most of his NBA career with the [[Denver Nuggets]] and [[Atlanta Hawks]] proved a dominant defender. Mutombo, who had not played basketball before arriving in the U.S. from his native [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire]] on a [[USAID]] scholarship, was among the greatest shot blockers in NBA history, leading the NBA in blocked-shots five consecutive years, in the course of a career in which he ranked second in the history of the league in blocked shots, behind only Hakeem Olajuwon. He was also the recipient of four [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]s, tied for the record with [[Ben Wallace]].

The [[1992 NBA draft]] marked the entrance into the league of [[Shaquille O'Neal]], who was drafted by the [[Orlando Magic]]. Immediately drawing comparisons to Wilt Chamberlain, the 7'1" (2.15 m), 325-pound (147&amp;nbsp;kg) O'Neal was billed as potentially the most physically dominating player ever. By his third season, he led the league in scoring and led the Magic to the NBA Finals, where they were swept by the [[Houston Rockets]]. After the 1995–96 season, he signed with the rebuilding [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Former Georgetown center [[Alonzo Mourning]], also drafted in 1992, established himself as a premier big man with the [[Charlotte Hornets]] and, later, the [[Miami Heat]], winning two Defensive Player of the Year Awards thanks to his prolific shot blocking while also proving a reliable scoring threat.

===Centers in the 2000s: The era of Shaquille O'Neal===
[[File:Lipofsky Shaquille O'Neal.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Shaquille O'Neal]]
The balance of power shifted to the Western Conference, and the NBA was dominated by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], who won titles in 2000, '01, '02, '09, and '10, and the [[San Antonio Spurs]], who won in '99, '03, '05, '07 and '14. The Lakers hired former Bulls coach [[Phil Jackson]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]] thrived in Jackson's [[triangle offense]]. The [[San Antonio Spurs]] were initially led by the 'Twin Towers' tandem of center [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] and [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Tim Duncan]]. With the arrival of Duncan, the veteran Robinson modified his game by playing primarily in the high post to accommodate Duncan's strengths as a low-post scorer and defender.

In the 1990s, an increasing number of smaller forwards, most notably [[Dennis Rodman]] and [[Charles Barkley]], excelled at the traditional Center functions of rebounding, shot-blocking and low-post defense, anticipating a trend towards relying on shorter and quicker post players that has continued into the 2000s, as exemplified by perennial Defensive Players of the Year [[Ben Wallace]] and [[Metta World Peace|Ron Artest]]. In the [[fast break]] oriented style of offense employed by a growing number of teams, the traditional role of the Center is diminished, if not done away with altogether. Many talented big men have elected to play the more versatile [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] position, giving them more room to run the floor and play outside the paint. The best example of this is [[Kevin Garnett]], a 7-footer (2.13 m and above) who listed his height as 6'11" (2.10 m) in order to avoid playing Center. Under the influence of European basketball, the offensive role of big men has been redefined to include more emphasis on perimeter play, as exemplified by 3-point shooting big men like [[Dirk Nowitzki]], [[Mehmet Okur]], [[Andrea Bargnani]] and [[Channing Frye]]. The Phoenix Suns also drafted [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] to support point guard [[Steve Nash]] during 2002–2010, but in the Knicks he also starts as a [[Power forward (basketball)|Power Forward]] instead of a Center.

The 7'6" (2.29 m) [[Yao Ming]] was drafted by the [[Houston Rockets]] with tremendous hype in 2002; possessing unprecedented shooting touch and coordination for a player of his height, many experts predicted he would revolutionize basketball. Yao proved to be a highly efficient rebounder and scorer, particularly with his mid-range jump shot, and showed the potential to be an elite defender. However, he would retire in 2011 due to a string of foot injuries that caused him to miss all but five games in his final two NBA seasons. Another heralded young prospect, [[Dwight Howard]] of the [[Washington Wizards]], has used his exceptional vertical leap to become one of the top rebounders in the NBA, while his spectacular [[slam dunk]]s have made him a staple of highlight reels.

===Centers in the 2010s: The rise of "stretch five"===
The low-post functions of the center position continued to dwindle in the 2010s as the NBA shifted into a more perimeter-oriented style of play. While there are still a few centers that play a more traditional style, some centers begin to adapt to the outside game.

The [[Miami Heat]], for example, featured a "positionless" lineup as coined by head coach [[Erik Spoelstra]], with power forwards [[Chris Bosh]] and [[Udonis Haslem]] shifting between center and power forward depending on matchups. The Heat won two NBA championships in {{nbafy|2012}} and {{nbafy|2013}} using this unconventional lineup.

The [[Golden State Warriors]] then won three championships in {{nbafy|2015}}, {{nbafy|2017}} and {{nbafy|2018}} by utilizing this same approach, [[death lineup|albeit with a smaller and quicker lineup]]. In this case, 6'7" forward [[Draymond Green]] was often slotted into the center position, creating matchup problems for taller centers with his defensive versatility, speed, high basketball smarts and perimeter shooting.

The rise of the stretch five paved the way for centers to add outside shooting to their arsenal. While they continue to roam the paint at times, they have also expanded their game to the perimeter with their three-point shots.

The stretch 5 differs from the [[stretch four]] in that though stretch fives can shoot 3's, they don't shoot them as much as a Stretch four does. They also have some of the skills that traditional centers have, as opposed to the stretch four, who is generally mostly just a 3-point shooter and doesn't possess many traditional offensive skills that a [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] usually possesses.

==Centers in women's basketball==
In women's basketball, 7'0" (2.13 m) [[Iuliana Semenova]] pioneered the center position, helping the Soviet Union women's team win two Olympic Gold medals, in 1976 and 1980, and never losing a game in international competition. Semenova also led her club team, TTT [[Riga]] to fifteen European Champion's Cup titles. The 6'8" (2.03 m) [[Anne Donovan]] led the [[Old Dominion University]] Lady Monarchs to the 1979 [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]] championship, and was the first female [[Naismith College Player of the Year]] recipient in 1983, before enjoying a successful professional career in Japan and Italy.

With the formation of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]], [[Lisa Leslie]] established herself as the premier center, and the league's most popular player. The first WNBA player to reach the 3,000 point milestone, she led the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] to consecutive titles in 2001 and 2002, and holds the distinction of being the first player to dunk in a WNBA game. Other prominent centers in women's basketball include Australian [[Lauren Jackson]] of the [[Seattle Storm]] and [[Karl Malone]]'s daughter [[Cheryl Ford]] of the [[Detroit Shock]]. Jackson can also be considered a [[forward-center]] because she is also a very good outside shooter, leading the WNBA in three-point shooting percentage in one season. [[Rebecca Lobo]] led the [[Connecticut Huskies]] to a [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Championship]] in 1995, but never recovered from a [[anterior cruciate ligament injury|torn ACL]] and had a disappointing professional career. When at the [[University of Oklahoma]], [[Courtney Paris]] was considered the next dominant female center after becoming the only NCAA player, male or female, to score 700 points, grab 500 rebounds and block 100 shots in a single season; however, she had a disappointing WNBA career and was waived before what would have been the start of her second season in 2010.  The tallest center in the WNBA, the late [[Margo Dydek]] of Poland, who stood 7'2", is still the league's career leader in blocks per game (2.72) and total blocks (877), solidly ahead of Leslie in that category despite Dydek having played 40 fewer games before retiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics: All-time leaders: Blocks|url=http://www.wnba.com/statistics/default_all_time_leaders/AllTimeLeadersBPGQuery.html?topic=0&amp;stat=14|website=Wnba.com|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most highly touted center in the women's game in decades, if not in history, is current [[Phoenix Mercury]] superstar [[Brittney Griner]].

'''Chase Field''', formerly '''Bank One Ballpark''', is a [[baseball park]] located in [[Downtown Phoenix]], [[Arizona]]. It is the home of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], the city's [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise. It opened in [[1998 Arizona Diamondbacks season|1998]], in time for the Diamondbacks' first game as an [[expansion team]].  Chase Field was the first stadium built in the United States with a [[retractable roof]] over a natural-grass playing surface, which will be replaced by synthetic turf before the 2019 season.&lt;ref name="usatoday7-12-2011"&gt;{{cite web |title=Diamondbacks Are Experts at Keeping Heat at Bay|first=Mike|last=Dodd|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2011-07-12-all-star-game-heat_n.htm|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=July 12, 2011|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The park was built during a wave of new, baseball-only parks in the 1990s.  Although nearly all of these parks were open-air, it was taken for granted that a domed stadium was a must for a major-league team to be a viable venture in the Phoenix area. Phoenix is by far the hottest major city in North America; the average high temperature during baseball's regular season is {{convert|99.1|°F|°C }}, and game-time temperatures well above {{convert|100|°F|°C }} are very common during the summer.

===Stadium funding furor===
In the spring of 1994, the [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]] Board of Supervisors approved a quarter percentage point increase in the county sales tax to pay for their portion of the stadium funding. This came about at a time that the county itself was facing huge budget deficits and lack of funding for other services. The sales tax being levied was very unpopular with local citizens, who were not allowed to vote on the issue of funding a baseball stadium with general sales tax revenue (usage of public subsidies for stadium projects was actually prohibited by a 1989 referendum). The issue was so controversial and divisive that in August 1997, Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox was shot and injured while leaving a county board meeting by Larry Naman, a homeless man, who attempted to argue in court that her support for the tax justified his attack. In May 1998, Naman was found guilty of attempted first-degree murder.&lt;ref name="asu1"&gt;[http://aspin.asu.edu/hpn/archives/may98/0072.html ASU.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804190859/http://aspin.asu.edu/hpn/archives/may98/0072.html |date=August 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costs for the stadium were originally estimated at $279 million in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/1996/09/02/story6.html Ballpark-Brick Sale to Offset Costs] Bizjournals.com&lt;/ref&gt; but cost overruns (in part because of rising prices for steel and other materials) pushed the final price to $364 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/1998/07/13/story2.html?t=printable D-Backs Expect Skyrocketing Results From BOB] Bizjournals.com&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the original stadium deal, the Diamondbacks were responsible for all construction costs above $253 million. These extra expenses, combined with the Diamondbacks and their fellow expansion franchise, the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], not being allowed to share in the national MLB revenue for their first 5 years of operations, left the Diamondbacks in a less-than-desirable financial situation, which would come back to haunt team founder and managing partner [[Jerry Colangelo]] and his group later on.

===1998–present===
Construction on the park began in 1996, and was finished just before the Diamondbacks' first season began, in [[1998 Major League Baseball season|1998]]. It was the third MLB stadium to have a retractable roof and the first in the United States (at the time, only Toronto's SkyDome, now [[Rogers Centre]] and Montreal's Olympic Stadium had them; others are now at [[Minute Maid Park]] in Houston, [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] in Milwaukee, [[Safeco Field]] in Seattle and [[Marlins Park]] in Miami). It was also the first ballpark to feature natural grass in a retractable roof stadium.

The stadium hosted Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 of the [[2001 World Series]] between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the [[2001 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]]. The [[2001 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Diamondbacks]] won all four home games, winning the world championship in seven games, and thus denying the Yankees a fourth consecutive championship. It was the first time since {{wsy|1991}} that the home team won all home games of a World Series. The only other incident was {{wsy|1987}}, both by the [[Minnesota Twins]].

Chase Field was originally named Bank One Ballpark after [[Bank One]] of Chicago, Illinois, giving rise to its nickname "BOB".  After Bank One merged with New York-based [[JPMorgan Chase|JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.]], the name change was announced on September 23, 2005.

In March 2006, Chase Field played host to three first-round games of the [[2006 World Baseball Classic|World Baseball Classic]].

Chase Field hosted the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] in [[2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2011]].&lt;ref name="usatoday7-12-2011" /&gt;

Chase Field hosted the [[2017 National League Wild Card Game]] between the Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies. This was the D-Backs' first appearance in the postseason as a Wild Card team. The D-Backs won 11-8 and advanced to the 2017 NLDS against the Los Angeles Dodgers but were swept in three games. Game 3 was held at Chase Field, when the D-Backs lost 3-1.

[[File:DBacks3.jpg|thumb|left|The pool at Chase Field as it appeared when it was sponsored by Ride Now Power Sports, current sponsoring is by Ram Trucks.]]
Chase Field also has a swimming pool sponsored by [[Ram Trucks]], located in right-center field, which is rented to patrons as a suite holding 35 guests for $3,500 per game during the 2011 season. [[Mark Grace]] was the first player to "splash" a home run into the pool.

In addition to baseball, the pool has been used by Monster Jam's Jim Koehler to continue his tradition of swimming after Freestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsterjam.com/Results/2011/01/29/Phoenix,_AZ/|title=MonsterJam Results January 29, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballpark also features a dirt strip between home plate and the pitcher's mound, one of only two current ballparks to do so ([[Comerica Park]] in [[Detroit]] is the other). This dirt strip, sometimes known as the "keyhole", was very common in old-time ballparks.

The park's foul territory is somewhat larger than is the case for most ballparks built in the 1990s. With 80% of the seats in foul territory, the upper deck is one of the highest in the majors. The park's suites are tucked far under the third deck, which keeps the upper deck closer to the action, with the exception of their Dugout Suites which sit next to the home and visitor's dugouts.

Before the [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2008 season]] began, a brand new [[High-definition video|High Definition]] scoreboard was installed beyond center field, replacing the original. The new scoreboard is {{convert|46|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|136|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide and it cost $14 million. It is the fifth largest HD screen in Major League Baseball behind [[Kauffman Stadium]].  The screen at Kauffman is larger by overall area and is square in shape but Chase Field's screen is larger by length and is rectangular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chase Field Offers D-Backs Fans A High-Def Welcome Back|first=Scott|last=Craven|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/arizonaliving/articles/0403chasefield0403.html|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=April 3, 2008|accessdate=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hd.engadget.com/2008/01/11/arizona-diamondbacks-getting-ginormous-hd-x-display-from-daktron/ Arizona Diamondbacks getting ginormous HD-X display from Daktronics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505135132/http://hd.engadget.com/2008/01/11/arizona-diamondbacks-getting-ginormous-hd-x-display-from-daktron/ |date=May 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Premium seating includes 4,400 club seats, 57 suites, 6 party suites, Executive suite, batters box suite, two dugout suites, and the Ramtrucks.com Party Pool.

The [[2018 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Diamondbacks]] and [[2018 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] game on April 2, 2018 lasted for five hours and 46 minutes in 15 innings, the longest running game by time in Chase Field history. The longest game by  inning is tied between the game between the D-Backs and Cardinals on April 3, 2013 and the game between the D-Backs and Padres on July 8, 2018. Both of these games went to 16 innings.

On October 12, 2018, the Diamondbacks announced they would be replacing their natural grass surface with a synthetic surface from Shaw Sports Turf for the 2019 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/mlb/diamondbacks/2018/10/12/arizona-diamondbacks-installing-synthetic-grass-chase-field-2019/1614391002/ |title=Arizona Diamondbacks installing synthetic grass at Chase Field  |date=October 12, 2018 |website=azcentral.com |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable events==
[[Image:Chase Field - 2011-07-11 - Exterior North East (1).jpg|thumb|Chase Field as viewed from the north]]
The stadium also hosts occasional concerts and international soccer games. For football and soccer, the field is set up with the end lines perpendicular to the third-base line and temporary bleachers added on the east side.

===College sports===
The organizers of the [[Cheez-It Bowl|Insight.com Bowl]] elected to move their game from [[Arizona Stadium]] in Tucson to Phoenix beginning in 2000, and Chase Field became the game's host. In [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006]], the bowl game moved to [[Sun Devil Stadium]], to replace the [[Fiesta Bowl]], which moved to [[University of Phoenix Stadium]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]]. The football configuration was notable because of the lack of nets behind the goalposts and the dugout behind the south end zone. The [[2005 Insight Bowl|final Insight Bowl]] played at Chase was between the hometown [[2005 Arizona State Sun Devils football team|Arizona State Sun Devils]] and the [[2005 Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team|Rutgers Scarlet Knights]].  The bowl, now known as the  ''Cheez-it Bowl'', returned to Chase Field in January 2016 due to construction being done at Sun Devil Stadium.

Chase Field has staged nine [[women's college basketball]] games. The second game, which was played on December 18, 2006, was shortened by rain with four minutes and 18 seconds remaining and [[Arizona State Sun Devils women's basketball|Arizona State]] leading [[Texas Tech Red Raiders women's basketball|Texas Tech]] 61–45. Venue staff closed the roof in an effort to finish the game, but officials deemed the court unsafe. In 2000, ASU played the [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Tennessee Volunteers]] at the same facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sun Devils Brave Elements to Win|first=José E.|last=Garcia|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/asu/articles/1219asubkw1219.html|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=December 19, 2006|accessdate=December 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chase Field was also the site of the "Challenge at Chase", a college baseball game between [[Arizona State Sun Devils baseball|Arizona State]] and [[Arizona Wildcats baseball|University of Arizona]]. Arizona won both contests.&lt;ref name="ASU"&gt;[http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-basebl/asu-m-basebl-body.html Baseball :: The Arizona State University Sun Devils – Official Athletic Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202055745/http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-basebl/asu-m-basebl-body.html |date=February 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been no game scheduled there since 2008.&lt;ref name="ASU"/&gt;

===Other events===
In February 2006, the [[Professional Bull Riders]] hosted a [[Built Ford Tough Series]] bull riding event at this venue. [[Chris Shivers]] won this event with a total score of 181.5 points (out of a possible 200) on two bulls, including an impressive 93.75 (out of 100) points on Taylor Made bucking bull, Smokeless Wardance, in the short-go round. During the long-go round, the roof was closed, but during the short-go, the roof was opened.

The stadium has hosted Monster Energy  Supercross rounds from 1999 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amasupercross.com/MediaGuide/SXMediaGuide_15_lores.pdf 2015 AMA Supercross media guide]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monster Jam]] came to Chase Field every year in late January about two weeks after Monster Energy Supercross.

==Roof and cooling system==
[[File:Chase Field aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Chase Field and Phoenix from the south, on approach to [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]]]]
Chase Field's roof is opened or closed depending on the game-time temperature. When the decision is made to close the roof, it is left open for as long as possible before game time in order to keep the grass growing. Even when the roof is closed, the park's windows allow enough sunlight to play in true daylight without overheating the stadium.

The roof, which takes just 4½ minutes to open or close at a cost of $2–$3, is closed three hours before game time using two 200-horsepower motors triggered from a control room in the upper deck above left-center field.&lt;ref name="usatoday7-12-2011" /&gt; A massive [[HVAC]] system then drops the temperature inside the park 30&amp;nbsp;°F (17&amp;nbsp;°C) by the time the gates open.  The chilled water system, which has cooling power equivalent to 2,500 homes of 2,000 square feet, also serves more than 30 buildings in downtown Phoenix.&lt;ref name="usatoday7-12-2011" /&gt; The cooling plant, located in a separate building right outside the ballpark, freezes water overnight to reduce daytime electricity demand.&lt;ref name="usatoday7-12-2011" /&gt;  Originally, the HVAC system didn't cool above row 25 of the upper level, exposing fans in the higher rows to  the heat during Arizona summers. Changes since then keep virtually all of the facility in air-conditioned comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.utah.edu/~u0511816/chase_history.html|title=History of Chase Field|website=home.utah.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Club Deportivo Palestino''' is a professional [[association football|football]] club based in the city of [[Santiago, Chile]]. The club was founded in 1920 and plays in the [[Primera División de Chile]]. They play their home games at the [[Estadio Municipal de La Cisterna]] stadium, which has a capacity of approximately 8,000 seats.

==History==
The club was founded on 20 August 1920, when they participated in a colonial competition in [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]]. It was founded by a group of [[Palestinian diaspora|Palestinian immigrants]]; the name of the club reflects the origin in [[Palestinian community in Chile|Chile's Palestinian community]]. In 1952 the [[Federación de Fútbol de Chile]] set up the first professional leagues. Palestino was accepted into the [[Chilean Primera División B|Second Division]], which they won to ascertain promotion to the [[Primera División de Chile|Primera División]].

In 1955 the club won their first national championship under the coaching of Argentine captain ''Guillermo Coll'', in that era the club became known by the nickname ''millonario'' (Millionaire) because of their ability to attract top class footballers.

In 1978 the club won their second league title, this time the team was led by Chilean captain [[Elías Figueroa]]. In this campaign they set a new record in the domestic tournament, for the number of games unbeaten and soon won the [[Copa Chile]] to claim the league and cup double.

In 2004 the club became a registered company, but the change of status did not bring the expected improvement in results. In 2006 they finished in 18th place out of 20 teams, forcing them to face a play-off against [[Club Deportivo Arturo Fernández Vial|Fernandez Vial]] to keep their place in the top flight. Ultimately the club would triumph thus preserving their spot within the Chilean first division.

The club made a surprising run to the final of the [[Primera División Chilena 2008|Clausura 2008 tournament]], where they lost to champions [[Colo-Colo]]. Following this success, the club intends to float on the Chilean and Palestinian stock exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Reuters]]|author=Cerda, Claudio|title=Chile's Palestino tapping roots to go public|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/sow/news?slug=reu-latamchile_pix_tv&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns|date=17 August 2009|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Palestino was fined the equivalent of $1,300 for using a new team jersey with the club's traditional colors, red, green and black, and with the number one shaped as the map of [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] before the creation of Israel.  Chilean Jewish groups complained, with a formal complaint to their national Federation being made by Patrick Kiblisky, owner of first-division club [[Ñublense]]. The jerseys were said to have been first used in December 2013, although the club said they were used in the prior season. The federation banned the shirts and fined the club by the grounds that the Federation is opposed to "any form of political, religious, sexual, ethnic, social or racial discrimination". On its Facebook page, the club stated: "For us, free Palestine will always be historical Palestine, nothing less."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chile bans Palestino football club 'anti-Israel' shirt|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-25821058|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
The site, at the foot of [[Beeston, Leeds|Beeston Hill]] beside the [[A643 road]] to [[Elland]], was owned by Bentley's Brewery and was called the Old Peacock Ground, after the [[pub]] which faced the land, hence the nickname the Peacocks associated with both Leeds City and United. The first occupants were [[Holbeck Rugby Club]] ([[rugby league]]) who moved from Holbeck Recreation Ground after buying the Old Peacock Ground from Bentley's for £1,100. The first competitive football match at the ground was the West Yorkshire Cup final on 23 April 1898 between [[Hunslet F.C. (association football)|Hunslet]] and [[Harrogate Town F.C.|Harrogate]], with Hunslet winning 1–0.&lt;ref name=DT&gt;Dave Tomlinson (2015) ''Leeds United: A History'', Amberley Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The club erected a new stand in readiness for the 1898–99 season. The ground eventually became known simply as Elland Road. For the 1902–03 season the Association football team, Leeds Woodville of the Leeds League, shared the ground with Holbeck RLFC in the [[1902–03 in English football|1902–03 season]], but Holbeck went under in 1904 after losing a [[One-game playoff|play-off]] against [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] and the ground was put on the market. After a meeting at the Griffin Hotel in Boar Lane in August, a new club, Leeds City, was formed and it was agreed that the Elland Road ground would be [[renting|rented]] for the upcoming season. The lease was signed on 13 October 1904, for a rent of £75 per year. The club had an option to buy the ground for £5,000 in March 1905, but in November, the price was reduced to £4,500.

After City's first season in the [[The Football League|Football League]], the club built a 5,000-seater covered stand on the west side at a cost of £1,050. Attendances were rising, culminating in over 22,500 people cramming into the stadium to watch a [[local derby]] with [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] on 30 December, bringing in £487 of gate receipts. An expansion programme continued and the club's directors ensured that the initial success was built upon, employing a "ground committee" to oversee developments. In February 1906, 3,961 square yards of land on the Churwell and Gelderd Road side of the ground was bought from the Monk's Bridge Iron Company at a cost of £420. The committee built a 4,000-seater [[grandstand]] which the [[Lord Mayor]], [[Joseph Hepworth]], unveilled before a match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 17 November. The project cost £3,000 and over half a mile of steel was used. There was a training track for the players that ran the length of the stand, dressing and officials rooms and a motor garage. [[Drainage]] work was carried out on the pitch to prevent it from becoming waterlogged.

City experienced financial hardships jeopardising the club's future but after much uncertainty, an offer of £1,000 and an annual rental of £250 was accepted for the ground. The ground was used during the [[World War I|Great War]] as a venue for [[Military parade|drill]] and shooting practice until the [[1919–20 in English football|1919–20 season]] commenced. City started that season brightly, but scandal arose involving illegal payments to players during the war years and the club was expelled from the Football League after only eight games. This led some local businessmen to contemplate digging up the [[clay]] deposits under the pitch and turning Elland Road into a [[brickyard]]. [[Yorkshire Amateur A.F.C.|Yorkshire Amateurs]] became the [[leasehold estate|tenants]], and that club played there for a brief spell saving the ground from development.

In 1920, Yorkshire Amateurs sold Elland Road to the newly formed Leeds United for £250.

===1920–1974===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
In the 1920s, the South Stand [[Terrace (stadium)|terrace]] was covered with a wooden [[barrel]]-shaped roof and came to be known as the Scratching Shed. Another stand was built on the east side terracing called the Lowfields. Behind the goal at the north end was a terrace known as the Spion Kop, or simply Kop, from a hill in South Africa on which 322 [[British Army|British soldiers]] lost their lives in the [[Battle of Spion Kop]], in January 1900, in the [[Boer War]].

No significant changes were made to Elland Road in the 1930s, and 1940s, although it did see some large attendances. On 27 December 1932, 56,796 spectators attended for the visit of eventual [[English football champions|champions]] [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] – a record that would last for almost 35 years. The last game of that season saw Leeds play [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] at home in front of a 9,006 spectators. The stadium was chosen to host the all city of Leeds [[Rugby Football League Championship]] Final between [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] and [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] in 1938, when a crowd of 54,112 saw Hunslet win the title. In the Second World War, the ground was requisitioned by the [[War Office]] for administrative purposes.

[[Floodlights (sport)|Floodlight]]s were first used on 9 November 1953 for a match against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] when the £7,000 lights, claimed to be the most expensive in the country at the time, were switched on. The game attracted 31,500 spectators who saw two goals each from [[John Charles]] and manager [[Raich Carter]] as Leeds beat the Scottish side 4–1. It was the first of several Monday night games against teams from north of the border and in successive weeks, [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] and [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] were the visitors to Elland Road.

[[File:Elland-road-1949.jpg|thumb|left|Elland Road before the [[Elland Road#West Stand|West Stand]] Fire of 1956.]]
In the early hours of Tuesday 18 September 1956, a fire gutted the West Stand and scorched large sections of the pitch. The blaze consumed the entire structure, including offices, [[Football kit|kit]], [[Leeds United A.F.C. club records|club records]], [[physiotherapy]] equipment, dressing rooms, directors' rooms, the [[press box]] and the [[Electrical generator|generators]] for the floodlighting system. The roof of the stand collapsed into the seating area before the [[fire brigade]] arrived and the total damage was estimated to be £100,000, but the club's insurance cover was inadequate. The players helped clear rubble and wreckage but the 2,500-seater stand could not be salvaged. After a board meeting, the directors decided to launch a public appeal to build a new stand with assistance from [[Leeds City Council]]. The appeal raised £60,000 and a £180,000 West Stand was opened at the start of the following season.

The new stand had of 4,000 seats mounted behind a paddock, which could hold a 6,000 standing spectators. Two years later another fire started after a [[Central League (football)|Central League]] match against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] affecting the West Stand. Fortunately, Cyril Williamson, the club secretary, and several directors were on hand and the fire was extinguished and no significant damage was caused.

The 1960s saw the arrival of [[Don Revie]] as manager and the club were promoted to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. The club finished in the top four places for the next ten seasons and Elland Road hosted its first [[televised]] game – a league fixture against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 20 March 1965 – and Leeds were 4–1 winners. Great advances were made on the stadium during Revie's reign and a new attendance record of 57,892 was set on 15 March 1967, in a fifth-round replay of the [[FA Cup]] against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. In April 1968, the Spion Kop terracing was stripped away to make way for a new stand at a cost of £250,000. The roofed structure was built in less than six weeks and became known as the Gelderd End. When completed it left around {{convert|60|ft|m}} of land behind the goal which was turfed and the pitch moved {{convert|30|ft|m}} north.

[[File:Elland-Road-Floodlights-night.jpg|thumb|The old [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] at Elland Road.]]

Further improvements in 1970 included the coupling of the West Stand and the Kop with a £200,000 corner stand, the North-West corner. To complement the upgrade, an almost identical stand was built, linking the Lowfields stand and the Kop, which cost £200,000. In 1972, when the Leeds United Sports and Souvenir Shop opened, featuring a [[Event programme|programme]] collection. In 1974, Leeds [[English football champions|won the league]] for the second time and the Scratching Shed was dismantled and replaced by the South Stand at a cost of £500,000. This [[state of the art]] development comprised a standing paddock capable of holding 4,000 fans, a row of 16 executive boxes, above which was an all-seater 3,500 capacity stand. Plans to link the South Stand with the Lowfields were curtailled when Leeds ran out of money. In the same year, the floodlights were replaced by the tallest floodlights in Europe, measuring {{convert|260|ft|m}}. Initially, three floodlights were erected – two at either side of the Kop and another in the South-West corner – and the other was erected four years later.

===1982–2000===
The first match televised live was the rugby league Challenge Cup final replay between Hull FC and Widnes played on 19 May 1982. In summer 1982, Leeds sold Elland Road to [[Leeds City Council]] for £2.5m, and the council granted the club a 125-year lease. Ambitious plans to improve the stadium and neighbouring sporting facilities were designed in 1987 by [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] architects and promoted by developers Baltic Consortium and W.H. White. The estimated costs were between £50&amp;nbsp;million and £75&amp;nbsp;million to re-build the Lowfields with a 7,500 all-seater stand and construct a peripheral 2,000-seater sports stadium adjacent to the stand. Other plans included a shopping centre, [[ice rink]], [[cricket]] hall, cinema, [[nightclub]], café, restaurant, [[waterpark]], [[leisure centre]] and shops. None of the designs were acted on.

[[File:Elland Road - Lowfields Road Stand 1991.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The old ''Lowfields Road'' stand.]]
In September 1991, the South-East corner was opened, joining the South and Lowfields Stands providing a full corner stand for away supporters. This section was used as the "family stand" until membership proved too big for its 1,710 capacity and a new home found in the East Stand. It is prominent because of its yellow seats, which have given its nickname, the "cheese wedge". A [[banquet]]ing suite at the rear of the west stand, with a [[Conference hall|conference centre]], was opened in April 1992.&lt;ref name="LeedsMad"/&gt; The biggest renovation project to date began in 1992, when the Lowfields was replaced by a new East Stand – a 17,000-seater stand with two tiers and no restricted views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=GMI Construction wins £5.5M Design and Build Contract for Leeds United Football Club's Elland Road East Stand|journal=Construction News|date=6 February 1992|url=http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/06feb92-uk-gmi-construction-wins-55m-design-and-build-contract-for-leeds-united-football-clubs-elland-road-east-stand/1047354.article|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On completion in 1993, at a cost of £5.5m, it housed 25 executive boxes, 10,000 seats in the bottom tier, part of which formed the members-only family section, and a further 7,000 seats in the upper tier. The East Stand was then the biggest [[cantilever]] stand in the world. In the close season of 1994 Elland Road became an all-seater stadium, with nearly 7,000 seats replacing the terracing in the Kop, as directed by the [[Taylor Report]]. The new-look Kop was officially opened in October by the club's president, [[George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood]] and Mrs E Revie, widow of the late [[Don Revie]]. The Gelderd End was renamed the Don Revie Stand in honour of the club's former manager.

On 16 November 1997, the third and deciding match of the [[Super League Test series]] between [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] was played at Elland Road before a crowd of 39,337.

In December 1997, £11.3&amp;nbsp;million plans to improve the West and South Stands were unveiled which would have raised capacity to around 45,000. A new structure mirroring the East Stand would have seated around 12,000 people. A three-tier structure would focus on [[hospitality]] with a 15,000-seater [[indoor arena]] at the rear of the West Stand. This venue would have accommodated basketball, [[ice hockey]], pop concerts and other events. However, after naming an ice hockey team, Leeds Lasers, to play at the arena, the project was shelved. Leeds received the ownership of Elland Road once again in 1998, when the new owners, Leeds Sporting Company agreed to pay £10m to buy back the stadium from Leeds City Council.

===2001–2010===
On 16 August 2001, chairman [[Peter Ridsdale]] sent a letter to [[season ticket]] holders and shareholders regarding the future of the club outlining two options, to improve Elland Road or to relocate. A [[ballot]] form was included but the letter was biased in favour of relocation.&lt;ref name="proposedmove2001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wafll.com/elland-road/ridsdale-letter.html |title=Peter Ridsdales Letter |accessdate=6 October 2008 |date=16 August 2001 |publisher=Leeds United A.F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 13% voted to stay at Elland Road and 87.6% of the 18,500 who voted were in favour of the move. On 7 September 2001, Ridsdale announced his intention to move the club to a 50,000-seat stadium at [[Skelton, York|Skelton]] in time for the [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/leeds-to-leave-elland-road-for-new-home-668447.html |location=London |work=The Independent | first=Ian | last=Parkes | title=Leeds to leave Elland Road for new home | date=7 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans never came to fruition as Ridsdale resigned in March 2003, leaving financial disarray and the PLC was soon to follow in March 2004.

Later that year, Elland Road was sold with a 25-year lease and buy-back clause to raise funds to pay an installment of a loan to [[Jack Petchey]]. It emerged on 27 December 2006 that the stadium had been sold to the [[British Virgin Islands]]-based Teak Trading Corporation 15 months before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/6212495.stm |title=Leeds give fans stadium assurance |accessdate=28 June 2007 |date=27 December 2006 |publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2006, the South Stand was updated and closed for the first few games of the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07 season]] while work was completed. The refurbishment included boxing in the concrete columns and alcoves; overhaul of the kitchen concourse area, a [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]]-level office area, modernisation of the corporate facilities above and a restaurant, Billy's Bar, named after former club captain [[Billy Bremner]].

Plans for development at Elland Road to include hotels, a shopping centre and [[health club]] were featured in the programme for the match against Huddersfield Town on 8 December 2007. There would be hotels on the site of the shop. Possible adjacent developments could include an arena, [[casino]], police headquarters, cafés, bars and parking for 2,700 cars.&lt;ref name=Redevelopment&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/Ken-Bates-plans-two-hotels.3571165.jp |title=Ken Bates plans two hotels at Elland Road |accessdate=13 April 2008 |date=10 December 2007 |work=Yorkshire Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 October 2008, the club released plans for redevelopment behind the East Stand containing a 350-room hotel, a covered [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] with shops, bars, and restaurants; extended and improved facilities for business conferences and events, a [[megastore]], [[office block]] and [[nightclub]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leedsunited.com/page/LatestNewsDetail/0,,10273~1431687,00.html |title=East Stand Re-Development |accessdate=28 October 2008 |date=27 October 2008 |publisher=Leeds United A.F.C. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412114410/http://www.leedsunited.com/page/LatestNewsDetail/0,,10273~1431687,00.html |archivedate=12 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 November 2008, the city council announced it would not be building the proposed [[First Direct Arena|Leeds Arena]] on council owned land adjacent to the ground.&lt;ref name="LeedsArena"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leedsunited.com/page/LatestNewsDetail/0,,10273~1445341,00.html |title=Leeds Arena |accessdate=6 October 2008 |date=6 December 2008 |publisher=Leeds United A.F.C. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211095747/http://www.leedsunited.com/page/LatestNewsDetail/0,,10273~1445341,00.html |archivedate=11 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 2009, the host cities and stadia to be used if England won the right to host the [[2018 World Cup]] were revealed. Leeds was chosen and had the bid have been successful the [[John Charles]] and [[Don Revie]] stands would have been rebuilt, leading to increased capacity of over 50,000 however this never happened due to England not hosting the 2018 World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/Elland-Road-World-Cup-stadium.5514042.jp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/8414235.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Milton Keynes picked for 2018 bid | date=16 December 2009 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 2009, chairman Ken Bates spoke about future plans to increase the capacity of the South Stand in the future by around 2–3,000. This would be achieved by removing the executive boxes and replacing them with seating, however, this work was never started due to Ken Bates selling the club in 2012.

===2010–present===
[[File:East Stand, Elland Road (20th February 2013) 006.JPG|thumb|right|The redeveloped East Stand in 2013]]
In March 2011, the East Stand Development began phase one of a five-phase redevelopment project which included an extension to the East Stand Upper's main concourse along with the addition of 25 executive boxes and a modern upgrade to the external appearance of the stand; whilst this created extra corporate facilities and more room on the concourse, it in-turn reduced the East Stand Upper's capacity by around 2,500 seats, thus leaving the overall capacity of the ground to stand at just under 38,000 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesquareball.net/leeds-united/2011/03/23/east-stand-development-in-pictures/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423162220/http://www.thesquareball.net/leeds-united/2011/03/23/east-stand-development-in-pictures/ |archivedate=23 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An arcade, hotel and megastore were planned to be built as part of the four further phases, however these plans did not take place following the sale of the club to GFH Capital who then sold the club to Massimo Cellino.

[[File:Elland Road East Stand &amp; North East Corner.jpg|thumb|Elland Road East &amp; NE Stands showing new banners in 2017]]
In June 2017, new Leeds United owner [[Andrea Radrizzani]] bought the stadium back from Jacob Adler's company Teak Commercial Limited for £20 million, using his own company Greenfield Investment Pte Ltd.&lt;ref name="Hay"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/leeds-united-become-owners-of-elland-road-once-again-1-8620963|date=28 June 2017|accessdate=28 June 2017|newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post|title=Leeds United become owners of Elland Road once again|first=Phil |last=Hay}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first game taking back control of the stadium was against Oxford United in a pre-season friendly on Saturday 29 July 2017 in which Leeds United won 2–0.

In July 2017 the club announced a number of internal and external improvements were in the process of being made to Elland Road to improve the general appearance of the stadium. The improvements consisted of a partial new roof and cladding on the West Stand, banners on either side of the East Stand, South Stand and North East Corner of the ground featuring Leeds United legends past and present. In addition, the inside of the West Stand, dressing rooms and hospitality suites all underwent cosmetic improvement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leedsunited.com/news/club-news/22109/whites-ready-to-unveil-new-look-elland-road&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revie Stand===
[[File:Revie Stand, Elland Road.jpg|thumb|left|Revie Stand]]

'''Capacity: 7,000''' (including North-East and North-West corners)

The Revie Stand is at the north end of the ground. It was previously known as the Gelderd End or [[Spion Kop (stadiums)|Kop]] and was originally a standing terrace, It was renamed in 1994 in honour of the club's most successful manager and former player, [[Don Revie]]. The Revie Stand was officially opened in October by the club's president, [[George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood]] and Mrs E. Revie, the widow of Don Revie. The design has 7,000 seats as stipulated by the [[Taylor Report]], making Elland Road an all-seater stadium. There is a "ground control box" in the north-west corner which is the most advanced in Europe.&lt;ref name=LeedsMad&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leedsutd-mad.co.uk/news/loadfeat.asp?cid=EDZ5&amp;id=117560 |title=Elland Road |accessdate=3 April 2008 |work=Leeds United Mad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Videos and photographs taken of everyone entering the ground are monitored and security operations are synchronised. Images and video footage are obtained by the [[Closed-circuit television|security cameras]] located around the ground.

===East Stand===
[[File:Elland Road East Stand - Showing New East Stand Upper Corporate Boxes.jpg|thumb|East Stand]]

'''Capacity: 14,900'''

The East Stand is the most recently constructed stand in the stadium. The two-tiered structure was built in the [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93 season]] to replace the Lowfields stand and was opened in the [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94 season]] at a cost of £5.5&amp;nbsp;million. On completion, it was the largest [[cantilever]] stand in the world, holding 10,000 spectators in the lower tier and a further 7,000 in the upper tier. The family area was moved from the South Stand and originally spanned the full lower tier; however, this was altered by Ken Bates and there are now two sections, one at either end of the lower tier for club members and season ticket holders attending matches with children. Sandwiched in between are 25 [[executive box]]es and a large concourse with merchandise outlets, food shops, [[Sports betting|betting]] booths and a restaurant. Due to the redevelopment, the capacity of the East Stand was reduced and the words Leeds United AFC were taken off the seats.&lt;ref name=LeedsMad/&gt;&lt;ref name=dooyoo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dooyoo.co.uk/sports-locations/elland-road-leeds-fc/294430/ |title=Elland Road Review |accessdate=3 April 2008 |publisher=dooyoo.co.uk }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Stand===
[[File:Elland Road, South Stand.jpg|thumb|left|South Stand]]

'''Capacity: 5,000''' (including South-East and South-West corners)

The South Stand was built in 1974 at a cost of £500,000 to replace the Scratching Shed, which had been there since the 1920s. It comprises two small tiers intersected with a row of 32 executive boxes and an executive restaurant. There are a few seats in the South-West Corner, and a large video screen for the 2009–10 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/back-by-popular-demand-20090515_2247585_1658680 |title=Back By Popular Demand|accessdate=6 July 2009| work=Leeds United .com|date=15 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South-East Corner seats 1,710 fans and was used to house the [[Road (sports)|away]] fans until they were moved to the West Stand. In summer 2006, the stand was redeveloped and closed for the first few games of the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07 season]]. The refurbishment included boxing in the concrete columns and alcoves to give the stand a more modern exterior; an overhaul of the kitchen concourse area; a [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]]-level office area; a total modernisation of the corporate facilities above and a restaurant called Billy's Bar, named after former captain Billy Bremner.&lt;ref name=LeedsMad/&gt;&lt;ref name=wafllERhistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wafll.com/elland-road/elland-road-history.html |title=A Brief History of Elland Road |accessdate=3 April 2008 |publisher=wafll.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a statue in honour of Bremner at the south-east corner of the stadium erected in 1998, after his death on 7 December 1997. The club's [[superstore]] is nearby.

===John Charles Stand===
[[File:Elland rd2.jpg|thumb|right|John Charles Stand]]

'''Capacity: 11,000'''

The John Charles Stand is on the west side of the pitch and was known as the West Stand until the fans demanded a tribute to former player [[John Charles]], following his death on 21 February 2004. It is currently the oldest two-tiered stand at Elland Road, having been built in 1957 after the previous stand burnt down, ironically forcing Charles' sale as the club needed the funds to pay for a new stand. The corporate seats are located here and there is a [[Play-by-play|commentary]] gantry and walkway for TV personnel. The radio and press have facilities in this stand. The West Stand houses the tunnel and the directors' box, where home and away team directors view the match, along with the club doctor. There are many suites incorporated within the stand and a banqueting suite and conference centre are attached to the rear, having been opened in April 1992. As of September 2011 parts of the West Stand became the new home for away fans following a £300,000 refurbishment. Future plans would see the John Charles Stand redeveloped to hold a two-floored, three-tiered 3500 square metre site. This redevelopment of the West Stand would see a new upper tier introduced along with executive boxes as part of the ambitions of turning Elland Road into a stadium further capable of hosting world class matches and events; however it is now unlikely that any redevelopment of the west stand will take place due to change of club ownership who did not go ahead with the plans.

===The pitch===
The pitch measures approximately {{convert|115|yd|m}} long by {{convert|74|yd|m}} wide, with run-off space on each side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/sport/clubs/leeds_united/administration.shtml|title=Leeds United in crisis – administration |accessdate=3 April 2008 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an [[Under-soil heating|under-soil heating system]] installed beneath the surface, consisting of {{convert|59|mi|km}} of piping.&lt;ref name=wafllERhistory/&gt; This, together with a good drainage system, means that only heavy fog, a [[blizzard]], or flooding would force the club to cancel a match. There are [[Water well|wells]] sunk approximately {{convert|70|ft|m}} beneath the West Stand and the North Stand and a [[Pump|pumping system]] is situated under the South Stand, meaning that the club can draw on its own supply of water, should the need arise. However, the first time the club used it, the pitch turned black as the water was too cold.&lt;ref name=LeedsMad/&gt;

{{wide image|Elland Road panarama.jpg|900px|align-cap=center|A panorama of Elland Road looking towards the East Stand}}

==Bremner &amp; Don Revie Statues==
A Statue for legendary Captain [[Billy Bremner]] was built outside the ground in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/a-square-deal-leeds-united-plan-stylish-revamp-of-area-around-bremner-statue-1-8880222|title=A square deal Leeds United plan stylish revamp of area around Bremner statue

==Future==
In August 2001, when Leeds were still a leading Premier League side, chairman [[Peter Ridsdale]] unveiled plans for the club to relocate to a 50,000-seat stadium in Skelton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leeds on the Move|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-70976/Football-Leeds-move.html|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=13 August 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, the club's 33,250 season ticket holders were asked to vote on the proposed relocation. 87.6% of them voted in favour of relocation, but the plans were abandoned within two years following the onset of the club's financial crisis and decline in fortunes on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1528777.stm|title=Leeds opt for new stadium|date=7 September 2001|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Leeds, on behalf of the Leeds City Region, submitted an application to be a Host City for the [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|2018 World Cup]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] on 26 November 2009. The club was represented by [[Peter Lorimer]]. This bid was successful on 16 December 2009.

Due to the specific stadium requirements imposed by [[FIFA]], it is likely that the redevelopment of the Kop (North Stand) will become two-tiered to approximately the same height as the current East Stand whilst the West Stand will be completely rebuilt with an envisaged final capacity of 51,240.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Leeds United: Elland Road for World Cup Artists Impressions| work=Yorkshire Evening Post| url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/Leeds-United-Elland-Road-for.5873133.jp | accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redevelopment of the East Stand for which Leeds already have planning permission will play a significant part in providing the facilities required by FIFA to stage matches in the World Cup.
Despite the English Football Association's unsuccessful bid to host the 2018 World Cup, the first phase of the East Stand redevelopment plan began in May 2011. This includes the adding of an executive tier sandwiched between the lower and upper tier of the East Stand which holds boxes such as the Gary Speed Suite, named after their legendary former player who died in November 2011. The East Stand façade was also given a makeover.

Plans for the redevelopment of the ground had also included a hotel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East Stand Development|url=http://www.thesquareball.net/leeds-united/2011/03/23/east-stand-development-in-pictures/|publisher=The Square Ball|accessdate=13 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423162220/http://www.thesquareball.net/leeds-united/2011/03/23/east-stand-development-in-pictures/|archivedate=23 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leeds bids to build two-storey casino|url=http://www.worldcasinonetworks.com/blog/130/leeds-bids-to-build-two-storey-super-casino-at-elland-road-football-stadium|publisher=World Casino News|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casino plans were dealt a blow when Leeds City Council granted a provisional statement for a large casino licence to a rival scheme in the city centre Victoria Gate development and the hotel plans also seem unlikely to happen due to change in club ownership to GFH Capital and then to Massimo Cellino who did not go ahead with the plans.

Two of Leeds' [[West Yorkshire]] rivals have also used Elland Road as their temporary "home". The first club to benefit from the facilities was [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], when a fire struck their ground on 3 April 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.htafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HistoryDetail/0,,10312~1062704,00.html |title=Club history |accessdate=3 April 2008 |date=18 July 2007 |publisher=htafc.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007175752/http://www.htafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HistoryDetail/0%2C%2C10312~1062704%2C00.html |archivedate=7 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leeds offered its services and Huddersfield played the last two games of the [[1949–50 in English football|1949–50 season]] there before returning to [[Leeds Road, Huddersfield|Leeds Road]] the next season, following extensive work to revamp the burnt main stand. [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] used Elland Road for three matches after 11 May 1985 when a [[Bradford City stadium fire|fire]] consumed a stand at [[Valley Parade]] during a match against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bradford_city/4506597.stm |title=Bradford remembers fire disaster |accessdate=3 April 2008 |date=11 May 2005 |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Peter |last=Scrivener}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after the Bradford City stadium fire, the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|1966 World Cup Final]] teams from England and [[German national football team|West Germany]] met in a rematch at Elland Road and raised £46,000 for the Fire Disaster Fund, with England winning the game, 6–4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/sports_talk/ask_albert/2865527.stm |title=Ask Albert – Number 96 |accessdate=3 April 2008 |date=19 March 1993 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Non-League football|non-League]] team, [[Farsley Celtic A.F.C.|Farsley Celtic]], reached the first round of the FA Cup in 1974, the game was played at Elland Road. Farsley's opposition was [[Football League Division Three|Division Three]] side [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] and a crowd of 10,337 saw the League club win, 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farsleytoday.co.uk/farsleyceltic/Memory-match-slideshow-Farsley-Celtic.3749975.jp |title=Memory match slideshow: Farsley Celtic v Tranmere Rovers 1974 |accessdate=13 April 2008 |date=6 February 2008 |work=Farsley Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 Elland Road hosted the replay to the [[List of FA Vase winners|final]] of the [[FA Vase]] which [[Yeading F.C.]] won 1–0 against [[Bridlington Town A.F.C.]].

Former [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] manager [[Alex Ferguson]] said that Elland Road was "the most intimidating venue in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=719694&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=5901 |title=Ferguson happy to renew rivalry with Leeds United |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=2 January 2010 |date=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rugby League===
[[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] rugby league club shared the stadium from the 1983–1995 after the ground at the [[Elland Road Greyhound Stadium]] in [[Beeston, Leeds|Beeston]] closed in 1982 (from 1980–1982 the club played at the [[Mount Pleasant, Batley|Mount Pleasant]] ground in [[Batley]]).&lt;ref name=HunsletHawks/&gt; The 1982 Challenge Cup Final Replay between Widnes and Hull FC was played there.

On 19 November 2011 the [[2011 Rugby League Four Nations]] Final between England and Australia was also played at the stadium resulting in an 8–30 win for Australia.

[[Leeds Rhinos]] have played several matches at Elland Road. In the 1988 [[RFL Yorkshire Cup|Yorkshire]] [[Rugby league county cups|County Cup]] final, they beat [[Castleford Tigers]] 33–12. Due to the redevelopment of their traditional home of [[Headingley Stadium]], the Rhinos will begin the 2018 Super League campaign with two league fixtures at Elland Road.

The record attendance for a rugby league match at Elland Road of 41,171 was set on May 19 1982 for the Challenge Cup Final Replay between Hull FC and Widnes.

[[American football]] made a brief appearance at the ground when the Leeds Cougars of the [[British American Football League]] switched from their old ground at [[Bramley, Leeds|Bramley]] to play at Elland Road in May 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Britball%20Teams/LEEDSCOUGARS.htm |title=Leeds Cougars |accessdate=3 April 2008 |publisher=britballnow.co.uk| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050107105420/http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Britball+Teams/LEEDSCOUGARS.htm| archivedate=7 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year they had to relocate because improvements to the stadium were required. The ground hosted a [[Gaelic football]] match between [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] and [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]], organised by the Yorkshire County Board of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], in 1987.&lt;ref name=Mark&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.lycos.co.uk/batty/history.html |title=History |accessdate=3 April 2008 |publisher=Lycos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a [[greyhound]] stadium to the south-west of Elland Road which opened on 16 July 1927. It was owned by the [[Greyhound Racing Association]] and they eventually sold it to the Totalisators and Greyhound Holdings (T.G.H) who were bought out by Ladbrokes in 1974.

In 1979, the track kennels were closed followed by the track itself on 1 March 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leodis.org/display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=20031030_10387820&amp;DISPLAY=FULL |title=Aerial View, Elland Road with Football and Greyhound Stadiums |accessdate=13 April 2008 |work=Leodis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] track known as [[Fullerton Park]], which operated between the two [[world war]]s, attracted audiences in the range of 10,000–20,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leodis.org/display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=2002821_6606692 |title=Leeds Speedway Track Elland Road |accessdate=13 April 2008 |work=Leodis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fullerton Park also held greyhound racing from 1927 to 1938.

The match featured ex [[Leeds United]] legend [[Lucas Radebe]] as part of Warrington's ringwalk and band [[Kaiser Chiefs]] also played songs at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/en/event/762276/2214237|title=BoxRec|website=boxrec.com|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film and television===
[[File:Elland Road, West Stand as it was made to look for the Damned United.jpg|thumb|right|Parts of Elland Road were given a retro look during filming of ''[[The Damned United]]''.]]
Older parts of the stadium were used in the 2009 film ''[[The Damned United]]'', which was centred on the 44-day reign of [[Brian Clough]] (played by [[Michael Sheen]]) at the club in 1974. Some shots of the 1974 Elland Road were shot at other locations to make the film look more in keeping with that era.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226271/locations&lt;/ref&gt;

Elland Road was used as a substitute for the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|old Wembley Stadium]] for scenes in the 2010 film ''[[The King's Speech]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The King's Speech: Behind the Scenes|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1405272_the_kings_speech_behind_the_scenes|first=Lisa|last=Stocks|work=Manchester Evening News|date=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was nominated for 12 Oscars, three of which were for its stars [[Colin Firth]], [[Geoffrey Rush]] and [[Helena Bonham Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/25/the-kings-speech-oscar-nominations |location=London |work=The Guardian | first=Catherine | last=Shoard | title=The King's Speech enjoys a royal flush at Oscar nominations | date=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground was also featured in a 1975 episode of BBC sitcom ''[[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]]'', "[[Happy Release (Porridge)|Happy Release]]", in which prisoners Fletcher and Blanco gain revenge on a fellow prisoner, Norris, by giving him a fake treasure map before his release. The episode ends with Norris being arrested by the police after being found digging up a section of the Elland Road pitch in the middle of the night; the scenes were actually filmed at QPR's [[Loftus Road]] ground.

In 1985, 15,000 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] held a three-day [[Convention (meeting)|convention]] at Elland Road stadium.&lt;“Integrity Keepers” District Conventions Programme&gt; Elland Road hosted the annual Jehovah's Witness conventions&lt;ref&gt;http://footballgroundguide.ipbhost.com/index.php?showtopic=21803&lt;/ref&gt; until 2013 when they moved to the new [[First Direct Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thousands set to flock to Leeds arena for major Jehovah's Witnesses convention|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/thousands-set-to-flock-to-leeds-arena-for-major-jehovah-s-witnesses-convention-1-5816826

==Transport==
The nearest railway station is [[Cottingley railway station|Cottingley]], although fans travelling will be more likely to arrive at [[Leeds railway station|Leeds Station]], which is approximately {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} from the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wafll.com/elland-road/elland-road-directions.html|title=Elland Road – Details for Visitors |accessdate=3 April 2008 |publisher=wafll.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is around a 35-minute walk, but taxis and buses run from outside the station to the ground. Visitors travelling by car can park in the ground's nearby car parks or make use of limited space in surrounding streets. On match days there are special bus services direct to and from the stadium, usually departing from Sovereign Street near Leeds Station as well as regular local bus services.

Leeds City Council have raised plans for a railway station on the [[Wakefield Line]] serving Elland Road but there are no time frames since capacity issues on the Wakefield Line and funding for a new station would need addressing.&lt;ref name=Redevelopment/&gt;

==Attendance==

===Leeds City===
In Leeds City's brief history, attendances were among the worst in the league. The club competed in the league for 15 years, from the [[1905–06 in English football|1905–06 season]] until its expulsion in the [[1919–20 in English football|1919–20 season]]. The club was poorly financed throughout that period. Association football was a new concept in the area, which as traditionally a rugby league region. Nonetheless, the club were, until the 2009 relegation of Luton Town, the highest-placed team not currently in the league in the all-time average attendance figures for the [[The Football League|Football League]] and [[Premier League]]. In total, 1,944,365 people attended Elland Road for all the matches played by the club, giving an average figure of 10,234.&lt;ref name=Attendance&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.com/html/attendance-all-time.html |title=All Time League Attendance Records |work=Niall Mackenzie |accessdate=3 April 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080309122725/http://www.nufc.com/html/attendance-all-time.html| archivedate = 9 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leeds United===
Leeds United was formed shortly after City's dissolution and entered the league in the [[1920–21 in English football|1920–21 season]]. By this time, football had established itself and in its first season, the average attendance was over 16,000. As of the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06 season]], 42,339,944 have attended all of Leeds United's matches combined, which gives an average of 25,689. This figure is the 10th highest average in England.&lt;ref name=Attendance/&gt; The table gives a summary of the attendance figures of all Leeds United's league games in every season since the turn of the century.

==History==
===Development and construction===
A city stadium was considered in 1955,&lt;ref name="FIFAStandars" /&gt; with the intention that it could function as host for the &lt;!--shield of the--&gt; [[1962 FIFA World Cup]] in Chile. The initiative was led by two professionals from Antofagasta, Miguel Bascuñán Pavez and Alberto Calvo Nieto, who formed the "Pro-Construction Committee" in 1958 with the aim of solidifying the project. It was decreed by law (13,080 from the Ministry of the Interior of Chile) that the lands then-occupied by the Club Hípico de Antofagasta (Riding Club of Antofagasta) be expropriated to the municipality for the construction of the stadium, stipulating the amount to be paid, the agreement being effective on January 31, 1959.&lt;ref name=Lex13080&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=27357|title=Autoriza a La Municipalidad de Antofagasta Para Expropiar El Terreno Que Indica y Cuyos Señala, De Propiedad Del Club Hípico de Antofagasta, Con El Fin de Destinarlo a La Construcción Del Estadio Regional De Esa Ciudad, Autoriza Al Presidente de la Republica Para Donar al Club Hípico de Antofagasta Los Terrenos Fiscales Que Indica y Cuyos Deslindes Señala, Ubicados en la Localidad de la Chimba, y Que Han Sido Entregados en Arrendamiento a Dicha Institución, Con el Fin de Destinarlos a la Construcción del Nuevo Hipodromo, Lo Autoriza, Ademas, Para Ceder a la Municipalidad de Antofagasta los terrenos Que Individiualiza, Ubicados en Esa Comuna, Y Ocupados Por El Estadio Municipal, Corporación Que Podra Enajenarlos Para Invertir Su Producto en Obras de Adelanto Local|website= Ley Chile|language=Spanish| date=November 5, 1958 |access-date=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount decreed was 300 million [[Chilean Peso|CLP]].&lt;ref name="History1" /&gt;

The [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]] caused severe damage to several stadiums in Chile, upsetting the calendar for the World Cup. On September 30, 1960, the Corporation of Development of Chile (Corfo) provided economic contributions toward the construction of the Antofagasta stadium, under the condition that work began before March 1, 1961. Mayor Santiago Gajardo handed over the land to the Santiago-based Wedeles, Balmaceda, Mathieu and Company, Ltd. on January 5, 1961. The work officially began on January 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mercurioantofagasta.cl/prontus4_noticias/site/artic/20071217/pags/20071217000514.html|title=Comienza la construcción|website= El Mercurio de Antofagasta|language=Spanish|date=December 17, 2007|access-date=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to financial problems, construction was postponed and the committee responsible was dissolved. Work resumed on July 3, 1961 with the demolition of the riding club's facilities.&lt;ref name="History1" /&gt; Calvo and Bascuñan reformed the construction committee and secured government and private funding, though they'd lost the opportunity to host the 1962 World Cup. On July 9, 1962, Razmilic and Co. restarted the unfinished work.

===Inauguration===
On October 8, 1964, the stadium was inaugurated before President Jorge Alessandri, Mayor Juan Floreal Recabarren and his predecessor Santiago Gajardo.&lt;ref name="History1" /&gt; Trading markets in the city closed that day at noon, with a request that private companies enable their workers to attend the event. Approximately 32,000 people came. The stadium was then the second largest in the country. The match of the event was between Unión Bellavista (local team) and [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conmebol.com/en/content/regional-stadium-antofagasta-venue-2015-copa-america-chile|title=Regional Stadium of Antofagasta, venue for the 2015 Copa América in Chile|website= Conmebol.com|date=October 18, 2014|access-date=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 12, a game was played between the teams of the city of Asociación de Fútbol de Antofagasta and Chuquicamata, which was attended by approximately 16,000 spectators. The result of the match was 4–2 for Antofagasta, the coach of the team of Antofagasta was [[Luis Santibáñez|Luis Santibañez Diaz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.estrellaantofagasta.cl/prontus4_nots/site/artic/20110627/pags/20110627001240.html|title=eSTADIO rEGIONAL DIJO "ADIÓS" COMO GANADOR|website= Estrella de Antofagasta|date=June 27, 2011|access-date=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former mayor Pedro Araya and a group from the sports community sought to rename the stadium "Calvo Bascuñan", in tribute to the promoters of its original construction. The municipality opened a process to consider this and other suggestions from the citizens.&lt;ref name="colosoangamos" /&gt; On February 13, 2010, the evaluation committee reported that the stadium would be renamed Calvo y Bascuñan (Calvo and Bascuñan).&lt;ref name="Nombrecalvoybascuñan" /&gt;

The Municipal Council processed the remodeling of the stadium in May 2010, by means of an extraordinary section needed to regularize the agreement – as Minera Escondida was a private entity and the project was a public work. It was assigned to the municipality through the Corporación Municipal de Deportes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elnortero.cl/admin/render/noticia/23176|title=

The '''Fantasy Sports Trade Association''' ('''FSTA''') is a Madison, Wisconsin-based trade group representing the [[fantasy sports]] industry, listing over 200 member companies on its web site as of January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fsta.site-ym.com/search/newsearch.asp|title=FSTA Membership Directory |publisher=FSTA.org |accessdate=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members range from small startups to large media corporations. FSTA was founded in 1998 and provides demographic data, annual conferences and collective action including lobbying to support the growth of fantasy sports leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2011-10-19/fantasy-sports-lobbying/50818236/1|title=Fantasy sports move into political arena |publisher=USAToday.com |date = 2011-10-19|accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1997, CDM Fantasy Sports, a St. Louis, MO-based fantasy sports company invited competitors Sportsline, Prime Sports Interactive, Sports Buff Fantasy Sports, and Sporting News to St. Louis to discuss pending legislation that could severely limit the growth of the fantasy sports industry. Over the next year, the companies communicated without an official organization and tracked the legislation. In 1998, during a fantasy sports conference in Las Vegas hosted by Fantasy Insights, a meeting was organized to again discuss pending legislation and several other topics related to the industry. The representatives from CDM, Fantasy Insights, [[EA Sports]], The Sporting News, and USFANS decided that it was time to create an official organization to help promote fantasy sports, and the Fantasy Sports Trade Association was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsta.org |title=FSTA History |accessdate=2007-07-27 |work=FSTA.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Foster was president from 1999 to 2002. Greg Ambrosius was president from 2003 to 2006. Jeff Thomas was the president from 2006-2008. Paul Charchian took the helm in 2009, and remains the current president.

==Demographic data==
It's estimated by the Fantasy Sports Trade Association that over 57 million people in the U.S. and Canada played fantasy sports in 2015. Participation has grown over the years, though USA participation for 2015 is consistent with the past few readings. However, participation is up in Canada mostly due to hockey.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

A study conducted by the FSTA in 2016 showed 57.4 million people in the U.S. with the 2011 FSTA Study showing 35.9 million people in Canada played fantasy sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jay | last=Correia | title=Daily Fantasy Sports (published book) | date=2016-04-23 | publisher= | url =https://www.bookDFS.com | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2018-01-12 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation has grown over 60 percent the past four years with 20 percent of males in the U.S. playing fantasy sports. That figure is up significantly from a 2006 FSTA study that estimated 19.4 million people in the U.S. and Canada played fantasy sports and 34.5 million people ever played fantasy sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fantasy Sports Conference Demographic Survey Shows Continued Growth | date=2007-08-02 | publisher=PR Web | url =http://www.prweb.com/releases/2007/8/prweb543818.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-09 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 study showed 22 percent of U.S. adult males 18 to 49 years old, with Internet access, play fantasy sports. Fantasy sports is estimated to have a $3–$4 billion annual economic impact across the sports industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Stephen | last=Dorman | coauthors= | title=The fantasy football phenomenon | date=2006-08-03 | publisher= | url =http://www.theacorn.com/news/2006/0803/Sports/076.html | work =Agoura Hills Acorn | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-27 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSTA was the first organization to compile demographic surveys of the fantasy sports market starting in 1999.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The first survey showed 29.6 million people age 18 and older play fantasy games, but that figure was reduced in later years when it was determined the survey also included people who play NCAA bracket pools, which are not the same as fantasy sports where individual players are picked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jeff | last=Zillgitt | coauthors= | title=We certainly live in a fantasy world | date=2000-02-28 | publisher= | url =https://www.usatoday.com/sports/comment/jzcol53.htm | work =USA Today | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences==
The FSTA holds two annual conferences each year - a summer conference, and a winter conference.

==Legal issues==
The FSTA has been at the forefront of the tension that has existed between fantasy sports companies and professional leagues and players associations over the rights to player profiles and statistics.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The issue came to a head with the lawsuit of [[Major League Baseball]] Advanced Media (MLBAM), MLB's Internet wing, vs. St. Louis-based CBC Distribution and Marketing Inc., the parent company of [[CDM Sports]]. When CBC was denied a new licensing agreement with MLBAM (they had acquired the rights from the baseball players' association) for its fantasy baseball game, CBC filed suit.

The FSTA filed a friend of the court brief in support of CBC arguing that intellectual property laws and so-called "right of publicity" laws do not apply to the statistics used in fantasy sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fantasy leagues permitted to use MLB names, stats | date=2006-08-08 | publisher= | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2543720 | work =ESPN | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSTA also argued that if MLBAM won the lawsuit it would have a dramatic impact on the industry, which was largely ignored by the major sports leagues for years while a number of smaller entrepreneurs grew it into a multi-billion dollar industry, and a ruling could allow the MLBAM to have a monopoly over the industry.

"This will be a defining moment in the fantasy sports industry," said Charlie Wiegert, executive vice president of CBC. "The other leagues are all watching this case. If MLB prevailed, it just would have been a matter of time before they followed up. Their player unions are just waiting for the opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=McCarthy | coauthors= | title=Fantasy leagues can use baseball stats | date=8 September 2006 | publisher= | url =https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2006-08-08-fantasy-statistics_x.htm | work =USA Today | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBC won the lawsuit as U.S. District Court Judge Mary Ann Medler ruled that statistics are part of the public domain and can be used at no cost by all fantasy companies.  "The names and playing records of major-league baseball players as used in CBC's fantasy games are not copyrightable," Medler wrote. "Therefore, federal copyright law does not pre-empt the players' claimed right of publicity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fantasy leagues permitted to use MLB names, stats | date=2006-08-08 | publisher= | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2543720 | work =ESPN | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision in October 2007.  "It would be strange law that a person would not have a First Amendment right to use information that is available to everyone," a three-judge panel said in its ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fantasy Sports Win Right to Player Names, Statistics | date=2007-10-16 | publisher= | url =https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&amp;sid=aVMAY0beLSoA&amp;refer=home | work =Bloomberg| pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq also is part of the [[Union of Arab Football Associations]] and has been a member since 1974. The Iraqi team is commonly known as ''Usood Al-Rafidain'' ({{lang-ar|أسود الرافدين}}), which literally meaning ''Lions of [[Mesopotamia]]''.

==Association Founded==
The Iraqi Football Association (Ittihad Al-Iraqi Le-Korat Al-Kadem) was formed on October 8, 1948 and was the third sports union to be founded in Iraq after the Track and Field Athletics and the Basketball Federations. The two unions took part at the 1948 Olympic Games in London, July 29 – August 14 – however the Iraqi FA had not been founded, so no football team took part in the Olympics. It was during the Olympics that the idea of an Iraq Football Association was put forward. During the 1948 London Olympic Games, Iraq's basketball team lost every game by an average of 104 points per game. They scored an average of 23.5 points per game. The team included Iraq’s first ever-national football captain Wadud Khalil and another member of Iraq’s first ever-national squad in 1951, the outside right Salih Faraj.&lt;ref name=IFA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mubarak|first1=Hassanin|title=Iraqi Football History|url=https://iraqsport.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/iraqi-football-history//}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==First Administration==
The first Iraqi FA administration was headed by President Obaid Abdullah Al-Mudhayfi and Saadi Jassim as general secretary, with its headquarters in the Sheikh Omar district in Baghdad. The IFA was an association of 14 teams from all over Iraq, they included the Royal Olympic Club (‘Nadi Al-Malikiya Al-Olympiya’), Royal Guards (‘Haris Al-Maliki’), Royal Air Force (‘Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya Al-Malikiya’), Police College (‘Kuliya Al-Shurta’), Kuliya Al-Askariya (‘Military College’), Dar Al-Mualameen Alaliya (‘Highest Teacher’s House’), Casual’s Club, Al-Marouf Al-Tarbiya (‘Physical Education’), Kuliya Al-Hakok (‘College of Law’), Quwa Al-Siyara (‘Armoured Cars’) from the capital Baghdad and four other teams [[Al-Minaa|Nadi Al-Minaa Al-Basri]] (Basra Port Club), Sharakat Al-Naft Al-Basra (Basra Petroleum Company) from Basra and branches in the provinces of [[Mosul]] and [[Kirkuk]]. &lt;ref name="IFA"/&gt;

==Controversies==
{{see also|Age fraud in association football}}
The Iraqi youth national teams have been ejected from tournaments for fielding over-age players.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.football.com/en-gb/massive-age-fraud-in-the-iraqi-youth-team/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Iraq was banned for using over-age players in the under-20 world championships in Saudi Arabia. That ban was extended when [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraq invaded Kuwait]] in August 1990.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/16/sports/soccer-iraqi-soccer-team-takes-its-first-shot-at-a-big-target-and-misses.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japan Breeding farms' Cup Classic''' (ジャパンブリーディングファームズカップクラシック) is an annual race that is usually held on November 3, the national holiday [[Culture Day]].  This race and the [[Japan Breeding farm's Cup Sprint|JBC sprint]] were started in 2001, following American the [[Breeders' Cup]], though the JBC has only two category race. In 2011, JBC Lady’s Classic was added for fillies and mares.

The track is changed yearly like the American [[Breeders' Cup]], so that the distances may differ.  The distance was 2,000 meters from 2001 to 2004, in 2007 and 2011; 1,900 meters in 2005 and 2009; 2,100 meters in 2006; 1,870 meters in 2008; and 1800 meters in 2010. In both 2012 and the following year, it will be 2,100 meters.

This is the highest-prized race in [[National Association of Racing]] (NAR), and the third highest-prized dirt event in Japan, following [[Champions Cup_(horse_race)|Champions Cup]] and [[February Stakes]] both organized by [[Japan Racing Association]](JRA). Until 2011, the winner’s prize was one hundred million yen. Although its prize money is high, this race is regarded as preparation for Champions Cup.

Until year 2017, all winners were come from the JRA instead of organizer NAR.

Kettlebell swing (AKA ''Russian swing, double-arm swing, or conventional kettlebell swing'') is a basic ballistic exercise used to train the [[posterior chain]] in a manner similar to broad jumping. It involves moving the bell in a pendulum motion from between the knees to anywhere between eye level to fully overhead&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.t-nation.com/training/kettlebell-swings-youre-doing-them-wrong|title=Kettlebell Swings: You're Doing Them Wrong {{!}} T Nation|last=Nation|first=Kelli Keyes, Abby Keyes, T|website=T NATION|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://greatist.com/move/how-to-do-the-perfect-kettlebell-swing|title=How to Do the Perfect Kettlebell Swing|date=2017-07-10|work=Greatist|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theboxmag.com/crossfit-training/kettlebell-swing-10000|title=How To Do The Kettlebell Swing|work=The Box|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be performed either two-handed or using one hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livestrong.com/article/140173-benefits-kettlebell-swings/|title=Benefits of Kettlebell Swings|last=Dale|first=Patrick|work=LIVESTRONG.COM|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three versions of kettlebell swing: Russian Swing, American Swing and Sport Style Swing. 

== Overview ==
[[File:Kettlebell Swing Hip Hinge Style.webm|thumb|Kettlebell swing - Hinge-based style]]
The kettlebell is swung from just below the groin to somewhere between the upper abdomen and shoulders, with arms straight or slightly bent, the degree of flexion depends on the trajectory of the kettlebell. The key to a good kettlebell swing is effectively thrusting the hips, not bending too much at the knees and sending the weight forwards, as opposed to squatting the weight up, or lifting up with the arms. This requires an intense contraction of the [[Gluteal muscles|gluteal]], [[Abdomen#muscles|abdominal]] and [[Latissimus dorsi muscle|latissimus]] muscles. The swing can also be performed with a release and catch of the kettlebell, which helps train the proper swing pattern where the arms aren't pulling up at the top. This can be done with two hands switching to a supinated catch. The one-arm swing presents a significant anti-twisting challenge, and can be used with an alternating catch switching between arms. Further variations include the walking swing taking a step forward at the apex of each swing, the outside swing where the kettlebell swings outside the leg, and the kneeling swing, swinging between the legs in a one-leg half-kneeling position. {{cn|date=September 2018}}

There is controversy within the kettlebell world about whether a swing can only be performed with a hip hinge, and not with a squat. Within the kettlebell sport world, employing knee flexion during the swing is more common.
== Types and variations ==
There are two types of kettlebell swings: 

* Hardstyle kettlebell swing (Hinge-based) – a hinge pattern which primarily utilizes the muscles of the posterior chain (hamstrings and glutes). It should be practised with a good ground connection for stability and power production; a flat sole shoe or barefoot is preferred when performing swings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19528502/kettlebell-swing/|title=The Right Way to Do a Kettlebell Swing|date=2016-09-12|work=Men's Health|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kettlebellkings.com/blog/kettlebell-foundations-the-hardstyle-kettlebell-swing/|title=Kettlebell Foundations: The Hardstyle Kettlebell Swing|work=Kettlebell Kings|access-date=2018-09-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Kettlebell sport swing (Pendulum-based) – the motion of the kettlebell sport swing is double knee bend compared to the focused hip hinging motion of the hardstyle swing. This allows for stretch reflex from hamstrings to help scoop the bell up, ensures upward trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kettlebellkings.com/blog/intro-to-kettlebell-sport-part-2-the-kettlebell-sport-swing/|title=Intro To Kettlebell Sport Part 2: The Kettlebell Sport Swing|work=Kettlebell Kings|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many variations of the kettlebell swing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.living.fit/p/kettlebell-swing-variations|title=Kettlebell Swing Variations|website=www.living.fit|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, some are, but not limited to:

* single arm swing
* one kettlebell double arm swing
* two kettlebells double arm swing
* suitcase swing
* swing squat style
* high swing

Within those variations there are plenty more variations, some are, but not limited to:

* pace
* movement
* speed
* power

'''Longue paume''', or ''jeu de longue paume'', is an outdoor version of [[jeu de paume]], an ancestor of modern [[tennis|lawn tennis]].  Hundreds of years ago it was quite popular, particularly in [[France]].   It is a game of gain-ground as [[Balle à la main]]

It was part of the Paris [[1900 Summer Olympics]], but its medal status is disputed. Today, the sport is most played in the region of [[Picardy]].  The governing body of the sport is the ''Fédération Française de Longue Paume'', with its headquarters in [[Amiens]].

'''National Trail Raceway''' is a quarter-mile [[dragstrip]] located between [[Hebron, Ohio|Hebron]] and [[Kirkersville, Ohio|Kirkersville]], [[Ohio|Ohio, USA]], off of [[U.S. Route 40 in Ohio|U.S. Route 40]]. The race track is located about 30 minutes east of [[Columbus, Ohio]]. It is known to local residents as 'National Trails'.

[[File:burnout at NTR.jpg|thumb|right]]

==History==
Clark Rader, Sr., along with sons Ben and Clark, Jr., broke ground on the facility in 1963, and completed the construction in 1964. At the time, United States Route 40 was known as the National Road and/or the National Trail, which is why they called it National Trail Raceway. It was the fifth largest racing facility of its kind in the United States at the time.

The [[NHRA]]'s national event known as the Springnationals bounced around among three different sites from 1965-1971. [[Wally Parks]], founder and head of the NHRA at the time, decided to move the Springnationals to National Trail Raceway in 1972, based on the popularity of drag racing in central Ohio. According to National Trail Raceway's website, "...the race drew more than 40,000 spectators and 600 cars. On both Saturday and Sunday, the (admittance) gates had to be closed while cars were still sitting on Route 40 waiting to get in to the event as the grounds were already full."

In 1976, [[Shirley Muldowney]] became the first female to ever win a national event in the Top Fuel Dragster category. In 1982, the first ever all-female professional final took place between Shirley and Lucille Lee.

For most of the Springnationals' history, the event was run in the month of June, often on or around Fathers Day weekend. But, due to Ohio's sometimes unpredictable weather, some feel this is why the performances of the race cars were usually not as quick or as fast as at other NHRA national events. The unpredictable weather often made for unpredictable track conditions. Thus, a number of crew chiefs would often have trouble knowing how to properly tune and prepare the race cars to run well. This led to many upsets during eliminations. In fact, several drivers scored their first, and sometimes only, national event win during the Springnationals at National Trail.

Because the track was built between two roads, United States Route 40 and Refugee Road, National Trail Raceway was known to have one of the shortest (post-finish line) shut down areas of any event on the NHRA national event schedule. In the early 1980s, the NHRA and National Trail Raceway used catch-nets on Springnationals weekends to help stop some race cars that couldn't slow down enough to safely turn off the end of the race track. But, in 1984, Top Fuel Dragster driver Doug Kerhulas had a problem stopping his race car by the end of the shut down area and drove his car into the catch-net, as drivers were instructed to do. Though the catch-nets did stop his race car from going onto Refugee Road, the sudden stop caused by the nets also nearly killed him. So, in 1986, the nets were replaced by sand pits. Ironically, Funny Car racer Gary Phillips couldn’t slow down in time and drove his car into the sand pits. But he was carrying so much speed, his car still went through the sand pits, across Refugee Road, and into farmer Herb White's front yard. The race car did not hit any vehicles and was able to miss the farmer's house. However, this was the only time the sand/gravel traps were not able to stop a vehicle, so NTR continued to use them any time the NHRA was in town.

The NHRA and National Trail Raceway eventually worked out a deal with the [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]] to close down that area of Refugee Road during Springnationals weekends. This allowed National Trail to connect the end of the shut down area to Refugee Road, giving drivers a little more room, if needed, to stop their race cars safely. And they worked out a deal with Herb White to move the sand pit to the side of his front yard, just in case.

The NHRA purchased the track from the Rader family in 1996. A first offer was refused, but when the NHRA threatened to pull the Springnationals from the track, a deal was reached. National Trail became one of the few tracks in the country to be owned directly by the NHRA. Shortly thereafter, [[Pontiac]] began sponsoring the national event held at NTR, and changed the name to the Pontiac Excitement Nationals and eventually the Pontiac Performance Nationals. The NHRA event was then moved from mid-June to mid-May. In 2006, possibly due to cooler weather conditions and better track conditions, Top Fuel driver [[Tony Schumacher (drag racer)|Tony Schumacher]] set a new NHRA national speed record of 336.15&amp;nbsp;mph. Following the 2006 NHRA season, National Trail Raceway ceased hosting a national event and the Pontiac Performance NHRA Nationals was moved 100 miles north to [[Summit Motorsports Park]] in [[Norwalk, Ohio]].

For many years, this event was one of the more prestigious national events on the NHRA calendar. In the 1970s, Diamond P Sports produced NHRA's syndicated television coverage of select events, and 'the Springs' was one of those events. In the 1980s, it was annually televised on either [[The Nashville Network|TNN]] or [[ESPN]], and for much of the '90s it was broadcast nationally on either [[NBC]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

As of 2010, the NHRA still owns the facility. The NHRA Lucas Oil Drag Racing Series and the NMRA hold events at NTR. NTR also holds events such as the Buick Nationals, the Mopar Nationals, and the Night of Thunder, which features jet-cars and wheelstanders.

NTR has also hosted the NHRA [[National Hot Rod Reunion]] and Super Chevy Shows' in the past.

On November 5, 2011 the NTR held the annual [[Ohio High School Athletic Association]] state [[cross country running]] championships.  The meet was formerly held at the [[Scioto Downs]] racetrack, but moved to NTR due to the introduction of slot machine gaming at Scioto Downs.&lt;ref name="tribchron"/&gt;

National Trail Raceway is also a member track of the Professional Drag Racers Association (PDRA), a regional sanctioning body of professional 1/8 mile (0.201 km) outlaw door-slammer drag racing.&lt;ref name="PDRA"&gt;[http://www.pdra660.com/ Professional Drag Racing Association], Retrieved Jun. 10, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

and their last was the [[1967 Pat Fairfield Trophy]]. Their best result was 5th in the [[1966 Easter Grand Prix]].
The driver for all the races was Rauten Hartman. They used [[Peugeot]] engines in all races except the 1967 races,
when they used [[Alfa Romeo]] engines.

'''Robert and Mariam Hayes Stadium at Tom and Lib Phillips Field''' is a [[baseball]] venue on the campus of the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], [[United States]].  The playing surface has been the home of the [[Charlotte 49ers baseball]] team since 1984, and the new stadium surrounding the field was opened in 2007.

== History ==
The Charlotte baseball team played its first season in 1979 at [[Calvin Griffith Park|Crockett Park]], the home of the Double-A [[Charlotte Knights|Charlotte O's]].  In 1984, a field was built on Charlotte's campus.  After businessman Tom Phillips paid to have lights added to the field in 1988, the facility was rechristened '''Tom and Lib Phillips Field'''.

The playing surface was redone during the 2003 season; in the meantime, the 49ers played at [[CMC-NorthEast Stadium|Fieldcrest Cannon Stadium]], fifteen miles away in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina|Kannapolis]].

In 2010, the 49ers averaged nearly 1,000 fans per game as 33,966 attended games at Robert and Mariam Hayes Stadium.  Through the first 8 home games in 2011, 8,166 attended games for a 1,020 average.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

As of March 3, 2011, the 49ers have a 96-25 record at the stadium.

=== Renovation ===
In the summer of 2006 it was announced that Phillips Field would undergo a $5.9 million overhaul with the goal of making UNC Charlotte's baseball facilities top-notch.  The project was funded by the late Mariam Cannon Hayes, a local philanthropist who had contributed money to numerous educational programs and facilities throughout North Carolina such as the [[Dale F. Halton Arena|Barnhardt Student Activity Center]] at UNC Charlotte and the [[Mariam Cannon Hayes School of Music|school of music]] at [[Appalachian State University]].[[Image:Outside UNC Charlotte Hayes Baseball Stadium.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Hayes Stadium in 2012, following replacement of the outer wall trees.]]

The renovation affected all aspects of the baseball facility at UNC Charlotte with the exception of the playing surface.  Concession stands and restrooms, previously available only across the street from the field, are available inside the stadium.  Whereas Phillips Field had one set of metal bleachers and a small metal pressbox, Hayes Stadium features a lower level of chairback seats and an upper level of bleachers.  The pressbox consists of radio and television booths and offices for the baseball staff.  On May 11, 2007, the hospitality suite that is part of the new facility was named in honor of Erik Walker, a former pitcher with the 49ers and the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] organization who was killed in a canoeing accident in October 2006.

During the initial stages of the renovation, Charlotte's baseball team practiced at local high school facilities.  The first half of the 49ers' 2007 season was played mostly at [[Fieldcrest Cannon Stadium]], but the team also played home series on the campuses of [[Winthrop University]] and [[Pfeiffer University]].

=== Return to Campus ===
[[Image:HayesStadiumField.jpg|left|180px|thumb|The playing surface at Hayes Stadium in 2010.]]
The 49ers opened Robert and Mariam Hayes Stadium on March 30, 2007 with a 3-1 victory over [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass]].  En route to the 2007 [[Atlantic 10]] conference title, the 49ers went 25-4 in all home games, including a 13-3 record at Hayes Stadium.

Despite being finished enough to host games during the latter portions of the 2007 season, the stadium was not complete until the summer of 2007.  The chairback seats were in place by late April, but the bleachers, pressbox, restrooms, and concession stands were not finished in time for the end of the season.

In October 2007 a new scoreboard was erected in right-center field, complete with a scrolling message board.  Plans are in the making to add a video replay board in the future.  An indoor practice hitting facility will be added adjacent to the third-base side of the stadium sometime in the near future.

==Features==
===Statue===
The facility features one of the campus's 14 Richard Hallier athletic statues. The statue of a batter graces the front entrance to the stadium. There are 11 more Hallier sports statues on the UNC Charlotte campus, all of which were donated by [[Charlotte]] businessman and philanthropist [[Belk|Irwin Belk]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hallierart.com/gallerya.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cemetery===
Two cemetery plots bracket the front entrance to the stadium. The plots belonged to the former Mecklenburg County Indigents' Home; A hospital that cared for the poor, which was located near the current location of [[Carolinas Medical Center-University]]. The burials occurred in the 1930s and 1940s, before the University moved to the location in 1961. The graves are marked with plain rock markers and no record of the names of those buried there remain. The plots are closed off by wooden split-rail fencing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxcharlotte.com/news/local/UNC-Charlotte-Football-unmarked-grave-115449439.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scott Wells (63), Aaron Rodgers (12), Korey Hall (35).jpg|thumb|The Packers snapping the ball.]]
A '''snap''' (colloquially called a "hike", "snapback", or "pass from center") is the backwards passing of the ball in [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]] at the start of [[play from scrimmage]].

==Action==
[[File:Yost positions.jpg|thumb|]]
The ball begins on the ground with its long axis parallel to the sidelines of the field, its ends marking each team's [[line of scrimmage]] in American football; in Canadian football, the line of scrimmage of the team without the ball is 1 yard past their side of the ball.  The player snapping the ball (known officially as the "snapper" in rule books) delivers the ball to another player, and that action is the snap.  The snapper may hand, throw, or even roll the ball to the other player.  The snap must be a quick and continuous movement of the ball by one or both hands of the snapper, and the ball must leave the snapper's hands. The various rules codes have additional requirements, all of which have the effect of requiring the ball to go backwards to a player behind the line of scrimmage (i.e. in the "backfield"). The snapper almost always passes the ball between his legs, but only in Canadian football is that required.

In the standard [[Formation (American football)|gridiron football formation]], the [[center (gridiron football)|center/centre]] is the snapper and is situated in the middle of the line of scrimmage. Only in [[arena football]] is the center required by rule to be the snapper. In other codes, a [[guard (gridiron football)|guard]], [[offensive tackle|tackle]], [[tight end]] or [[wide receiver|split end]] can legally deliver the snap; such scenarios, known as an ''unbalanced line'', are seldom used outside of [[trick play]]s and novelties.

[[Image:2005PoinsettaBowl-Navy-Snap.jpg|thumb|left|Exchange of the snap between the center's legs.]]
For a handed snap, the snapper will usually have his head up, facing opponents.  For a thrown snap, especially in formations wherein the ball may be snapped to players in different positions, the snapper will commonly [[wikt:bend over|bend over]] looking between his legs.  Because of the vulnerability of a player in such a position, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the National Federation of State High School Associations ("Fed") have adopted rules providing that if a player is positioned at least 7 yards behind the neutral zone to receive a snap, opponents are not to deliberately contact the snapper until one second after the snap (NCAA), or until the snapper has a chance to react (Fed).  However, in professional football it is common for a center to be able to practice a single [[Shotgun formation|"shotgun" formation]] thrown snap enough to keep his head up and toss it blindly.

In the [[National Football League]] (and presumably other levels), the snap is considered a backward pass and not a handoff.  This rule was highlighted in a preseason 2014 game between the [[Arizona Cardinals]] and the [[Minnesota Vikings]], when [[Zach Bauman]] picked up the ball from the turf after a bad snap and ran it six yards for a touchdown.  Since the loose ball was a dropped backward pass and not a fumble, any player could pick up the ball and advance the ball—if it were a fumble, only the original carrier could advance the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/08/zach-bauman-arizona-cardinals-minnesota-Vikings|publisher=[[USA Today]]|title=Cardinals RB Zach Bauman scores most bizarre TD of early NFL preseason|first=Tom|last=Pelissero|date=August 17, 2014|accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Snap count==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
The team entitled to snap the ball will usually know in advance the moment when the snap is to occur as one of their players calls out signals, which usually include a loud sound such as "hut" voiced one or more times, the number of which they know; they are thus said to know the "snap count".  Therefore, they have a considerable advantage over their opponents. The Center is not, however, allowed to make motions simulating part of the snap action; therefore their opponents can be confident the first motion of the ball or the Center's hands is the beginning of the snap.

The snap count is decided on in the [[huddle]], usually expressed as "...on &lt;number&gt;." being the final words spoken by the quarterback after calling the play but before the huddle breaks and the players go to the [[line of scrimmage]].  The snap count allows offensive players to have a small head start.  The defensive players want to predict the snap, and build up speed such that they cross the [[line of scrimmage]] exactly as the play begins, so as to increase their chances of getting a tackle for a loss or a sack. By varying the snap count, a quarterback forces the defensive players to react to the movement of the offensive players, or risk being called for an [[Penalty (American football)#Offside|offsides]] or [[Encroachment (American football)|encroachment]] penalty. Unfortunately for the offense, this advantage can sometimes become a disadvantage. When faced with an exceptionally loud stadium, players may be unable to hear the snap count, and are forced to concentrate more on visual cues (silent snap count or a [[Hard count (American football)|hard count]]), or risk [[false start]] penalties.

The offense must also be mindful of the [[play clock]]. If they fail to snap the ball in time they incur a delay of game penalty.  Also, with a dwindling play clock, the defense has better chances of guessing when the ball will be snapped.  It is easier to predict when the ball will be snapped with 2 seconds left on the play clock, rather than 5 seconds.

The defensive team is not allowed to simulate, by calling out numbers, the offense's snap count. Successfully simulating the count would cause members of the offensive team to act too early ruining co-ordination of the play and inviting penalties. Current rules, unlike earlier rules, position officials so far from the line of scrimmage for 50 minutes of the 60-minute game that it is extremely difficult to hear if the defense is simulating the count.

== History and rationale ==

The snap, the set [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]] and [[Rugby union gameplay#Ruck|ruck]] in today's [[rugby union]], and the [[Playing rugby league#Play-the-ball|play-the-ball]] in [[rugby league]] have common origins in [[rugby football]].  As the rules of rugby's scrimmage were written when the game came to North America, they had a significant flaw which was corrected by custom elsewhere, but by the invention of the snap in American football.&lt;ref&gt;http://users.bestweb.net/~robgood/football/uncontested.txt Why the Uncontested Scrimmage&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule adopted by a committee for American football in 1880 first provided for the uncontested right of one side to play the ball by foot (in any direction) for a scrimmage.  A certain use of the foot on the ball which had the same effect as heeling it back was known as a "snap".  Later in the 19th Century the option of snapping the ball back by hand was added.  The option to play the ball with the foot was preserved, however, for several decades, although by early in the 20th Century it was restricted to kicking the ball forward.  The kick forward in scrimmage was a surprise play which did not work against a prepared defense.  Also for several decades alternatives to the scrimmage for playing the ball from across the sideline after it had gone out of bounds—a throw-in or "fair", and "bounding in"—existed.  Note also that until well into the 20th Century, rather than an official readying the ball for scrimmage, the side entitled to the snap had complete custody of the ball and could snap it from the required spot at any time; for instance, a tackled ball carrier might feign injury, then suddenly snap the ball while recumbent, there being no stance requirement yet.  The neutral zone and the right of the Center not to be contacted by an opponent before the snap also was not an original feature.  As the 20th Century drew to a close, the NCAA and National Federation of State High School Associations extended that protection to some time '''after''' the snap, in cases where a player is positioned at least 7 yards deep to receive a thrown snap.

Canadian football used the rugby scrimmage unaltered until near the end of the 19th Century, when, regionally at first, under the influence of the American scrimmage, the number of players in the scrimmage was limited to three—a "centre scrimmager" bound on either side by props called "side scrimmagers".  The centre scrimmager was later renamed the "snap", and in intercollegiate play one side was given the right to put foot to ball first.  Beginning regionally again and universally by 1923, the [[Burnside rules]] led to the 3-man scrimmage being reduced to the centre alone, the number of players on the field being reduced commensurately from 14 to 12, and a snap rule and neutral zone similar to that of American football was adopted.  In addition to the between-the-legs requirement noted above, for several years after the adoption of the hand snap, a hand-to-hand snap was illegal, the ball required to be thrown instead, in Canadian football. (Though it was technically legal, the hand-to-hand snap was not used on the American side of the border until the 1930s.)  Apparently a complete break was desired from system of backheeling, and the T formation having gone into eclipse in American football at the time, the Canadian snap was modeled on the formations then in common use in the USA, such as the single wing.

The game design rationale for requiring the snap to be a quick and continuous motion to the backfield is to eliminate the need for rules provisions for a live ball in scrimmage.  In Rugby Union the ball may be retained by the forwards and played for a time via the foot in a scrummage (which Rugby League has as well) or [[Rugby union gameplay#Ruck|ruck]], or by the hands in a [[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|maul]], necessitating additional restrictions on play and player positioning during those intervals.  In American and Canadian football, the ball as it is put in play is only held in the line (by the Center) for a fraction of a second.  The uncontested possession also, as [[Walter Camp]] pointed out, allows for better offensive and defensive planning by the side entitled to snap the ball and their opposition, respectively.  A [[Muffed punt|muffed]] snap can be recovered by either team.

'''Socialist Workers' Sport International''' ({{lang-de|Sozialistische Arbeitersport Internationale}}, SASI) was an international [[socialist]] sporting organisation, based in [[Lucerne]]. It was founded in 1920, and consisted of six national federations (with a combined membership of about one million) at the time of its foundation. Initially it was known as '''International Association for Sports and Physical Culture'''. Informally it was known as the '''Lucerne Sport International'''. It adopted the name SASI in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, Bruce. The Struggle for Canadian Sport. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1996. p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Austro-Marxism|Austro-Marxist]] [[Julius Deutsch]] was the president of SASI.&lt;ref name="wheel"/&gt;

[[International Labour Sports Federation]] (CSIT) was established in 1946 as the successor of SASI.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]] &amp; [[James Riordan]] (eds.) (1996). ''The Story of Worker Sport.'' Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics. {{ISBN|978-0873228749}}; Halevi Olin (ed.) (2013). ''Sport, Peace and Development. International Worker Sport. 1913 - 2013.''

==Foundation==

An international meeting of workers sports associations had been held in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]], in 1913. However, the [[First World War]] put the build-up of an international workers' sport organisation on hold. After the war two Belgians, Gaston Bridoux and Jules Devlieger, took initiative to revive the cooperation. Preparatory meetings were held in [[Seraing]], [[Belgium]] in 1919 and in [[Paris]], [[France]], during Easter 1920. The founding congress of the international took place in Lucerne September 13-September 14, 1920. During the foundation, the French and Belgian delegations urged that the word 'Socialist' be omitted from the name of the organisation, in order to attract a broader following.&lt;ref name="stein"&gt;Steinberg, David A.. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/260115 The Workers' Sport Internationals 1920&amp;ndash;28]'', in ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 13, No. 2, Special Issue: Workers' Culture (Apr., 1978), pp. 233&amp;ndash;251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

The organisation upheld a policy of neutrality towards party organisations, a policy inherited from the German workers' sports movement (which tried to steer away from the fractional conflicts between the German socialists). This policy was however challenged by the communists, which claimed that the workers' sport movement could not abstain from taking part in revolutionary struggle. In 1921, the third congress of the [[Communist International]] decided to form a parallel sport international. In August 1921, the [[Sportintern]] was founded. [[Sportintern]] launched fierce political attacks against the Lucerne international. Its Czechoslovak section had suffered a split in July 1921, as the communists deserted it.&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;

At the second congress of the Lucerne International, held in Leipzig 1922, the French delegation argued in favour of unification between the two Internationals. This policy was not supported by the congress. The following year, the French affiliate FST decided to shift its membership to [[Sportintern]].&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;

Ahead of the 1925 Workers Olympiad, the [[Sportintern]] appealed to the Lucerne International that four [[Sportintern]] delegations (France, Soviet Union, Norway, Czechoslovakia) should be allowed to participate. Discussions lingered on within the Lucerne International, but after communist sportsmen had made a public protest at a German Workers Sports Festival in [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]] in 1924, it was decided that the [[Sportintern]] would be barred from the Workers Olympiad. Likewise SASI barred its affiliates for participating in the 1928 [[Spartakiad]] organised by [[Sportintern]].&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;

Politically, SASI was supported by the [[International Federation of Trade Unions]] and the [[Labour and Socialist International]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110001136801/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workers' Olympiads==
The main activity of SASI was the organizing of the [[International Workers' Olympiads]], portrayed as a socialist alternative to the '[[bourgeois]]' [[Olympics]]. At the Workers Olympiads only the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] was used, rather than national flags.
*The [[1925 Workers' Summer Olympiad|first Workers' Olympiad]] was held in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]], in 1925. There were around 150,000 spectators. A world record was broken in the 100 meter women's relay race. The summer Workers Olympiad had been preceded by [[1925 Workers' Winter Olympiad|winter games]] the same year, in [[Schreiberhau]], in which twelve national delegations had participated.
*The [[1931 Workers' Summer Olympiad|second Workers' Olympiad]] was held in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], in 1931. 80,000 athletes took part in the games, which had around 250,000 spectators. The games were larger than the [[1932 Los Angeles Olympics]], both in number of participants and spectators.&lt;ref name="vcn"&gt;http://www.vcn.bc.ca/outlook/library/articles/jewsontheleft/p05SocialistSports.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[1931 Workers' Winter Olympiad|winter Workers' Olympiad]] was held in [[Mürzzuschlag]], [[Austria]], in 1931. Like the summer event, the winter Workers Olympiad was larger (in number of participants and spectators) than the [[1932 Lake Placid Olympics]].
*The [[1937 Workers' Summer Olympiad|third Workers' Olympiad]] was held in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]] in 1937. For the first time, non-SASI organisations could send delegates. A delegation from the [[Soviet Union]] took part, and won the football final. Around 50,000 people watched the final day of the Workers Olympiad, and 200 000 took part in the closing rally. A [[1937 Workers' Winter Olympiad|winter Workers Olympics]] were held in [[Janské Lázně]], [[Czechoslovakia]].
*A [[1943 Workers' Summer Olympiad|fourth Workers' Olympiad]] was planned to be held in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] in 1943, but never materialized.&lt;ref name="wheel"&gt;Wheeler, Robert F..

[[File:Third umpire lights at Melbourne Cricket Ground.JPG|thumb|right|The third umpire lights at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]]]
The '''third umpire''' (or '''TV Umpire''') is an off-field [[umpire (cricket)|umpire]] in international [[cricket]] matches who makes the final decision in questions referred to him by the two on-field umpires. Television replays and other technology are available to the third umpire to assist him in coming to a decision. An on-field umpire can, at his own discretion, use a radio link to refer any close decision concerning [[dismissal (cricket)|dismissals]] (catches, runouts or stumpings) or [[boundary (cricket)|boundaries]] to the third umpire. Also players can initiate reviews of particular decisions by the on-field umpires, which are judged by the third umpire.

==History==

The third umpire was conceptualized by former Sri Lankan domestic cricketer, and current cricket writer Mahinda Wijesinghe and debuted in Test cricket in November 1992 at [[Kingsmead cricket ground, Durban|Kingsmead]], [[Durban]] for the [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] vs. [[Indian cricket team|India]] series. [[Karl Liebenberg]] was the third umpire with [[Cyril Mitchley]] the on-field umpire, referring the run-out decision in this match. [[Sachin Tendulkar]] became the first batsman to be dismissed ([[run out]]) by using television replays in the second day of the Test scoring 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153619.html|title=Wisden: 1st Test South Africa v India 1992–93|publisher=cricinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==

{{Main|Umpire Decision Review System}}

===Decision requests by the on-field umpires===

In many cases of [[run out]] or [[stumped]], the event occurs in a fraction of a second. If the on-field umpires are unable to decide if the batsman is out, they may request the third umpire to ascertain whether the batsman had made it home. The third umpire then looks at various TV replays from different angles, comes to a conclusion, and indicates his decision by pressing the appropriate signal. Originally decisions were conveyed in traffic light style (a red light indicating a batsman's dismissal, a green light not out); it is now common practice to display the decision via the large screen scoreboard, if available. If the umpire is unsure if a batsman is out or not, due to lack of conclusive evidence, the usual procedure is to acquit the batsman, known in cricketing parlance as "the benefit of the doubt".

The third umpire may also be called upon if the on-field umpire cannot decide which batsman is out (i.e. they end up at the same end). An example of this was the Third Test between New Zealand and the West Indies in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36SLpqAymTEvettori Bizarre Runout]&lt;/ref&gt;

A batsman is caught out  if a [[Fielding (cricket)|fielder]] catches the ball on the fly. In some cases the fielder may catch the ball a few inches above ground level. If the umpire's vision is obscured or is unsure if the ball bounced before the fielder caught the ball, he can also refer the decision.

A [[six (cricket)|six]] is scored if the batsman hits the ball directly beyond the perimeter of the field. In some cases the ball may bounce just a foot inside the boundary rope resulting in [[four (cricket)|four runs]]. If the umpire needs to ascertain if it had been a 4 or a 6, he may consult the third umpire. Near the boundary, often a fielder may dive to save the ball from travelling beyond the boundary. If the fielder makes any simultaneous contact with the boundary and the cricket ball, 4 runs are declared. A third umpire may also be consulted in such a case.

===Decision requests by the players===

The third umpire also adjudicates appeals initiated by the players against decisions made by the on-field umpires, as part of the [[Umpire Decision Review System]], and reports to the on-field umpire whether his analysis supports the original call, contradicts the call, or is inconclusive.

==Instant replays==

Whenever a third umpire decision is signalled by an on-field umpire, the third umpire gets access to instant replay to make his decision. The instant replays are also available to the TV/Internet viewers. However, the live crowd does not get to witness it. Because in most of the cases, third umpire decisions end up in a tight gap between out and not out. A live crowd will make their decision on the replay shown. However, the third umpire is required to follow guidelines which may not be known by the crowd.

After the [[Stuart Broad]] incident, in [[The Ashes]] 2013, [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] has started to take steps to give third umpire access to instant replays. This is regardless of calls being referred to by on-field umpires. By doing so, ICC wants to make sure that any obvious mistakes are avoided in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2013/content/story/652785.html|title=ICC trials instant replays for third umpires|publisher=espncricinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tirador''' is a [[velodrome]] in [[Palma de Mallorca|Palma]] (Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain). It is an outdoor track cycling, opened in 1903 and was the most important velodrome built in Spain during 60 years. It was closed in 1973 and still existing, but no longer in use. Since 2015 it is of municipal property and is currently in process of rehabilitation.

It has been one of the four cycling tracks in the city. Before it existed [[Son Espanyolet (velodrome)|Son Espanyolet]] (1893–1911), then the current velodrome of [[Son Moix (velodrome)|Son Moix]] (1987) and finally the [[Palma Arena]] (2007).{{sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=137}}

== History ==

=== Origins and construction ===

The Palma cyclist society [[Veloz Sport Balear]] was the driving force behind its construction. In the decade of 1890s the track cycling was beginning to take hold on the island and, with it, several slopes of poor quality and short route surfaced. Thus was born the first velodrome of the capital: ''Son Espanyolet'', inaugurated in 1893.{{Sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=21}} Like the rest, its construction was technically deficient (it was reopened twice more, to make up for its shortcomings) and the ''Veloz Sport Balear'' (one of the tenants of the track) thought of building a better quality enclosure, in addition to doing it on their own land guarantee its durability. For this he acquired some land (then outside the walls) of the city, near the torrent of ''sa Riera'' that formerly crossed the city.

The first ''Tirador'' stone was placed on 4 December 1898, but various circumstances (mainly lack of liquidity) interrupted the works on several occasions and prolonged them for almost five years, until which was inaugurated on 10 August 1903. After its inauguration of the activity in ''Son Espanyolet'' it completely ceased and shortly afterwards it disappeared.{{Sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=30}}

=== First years ===

Its inauguration was a national event and very soon ''Tirador'' became the reference track in Spain: there was held Spanish National of Track Cycling Sprint Championships in 1904, evidence that had ceased to be disputed in 1897 for lack of an adequate track.{{sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=31}} At the same time it propitiated the birth of the Spanish National of Track Cycling Motor-Paced Championships in 1908, until then non-existent, since it was the most suitable track for the long-distance race dispute.{{Sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=37}} Despite this, the cycling fans in [[Mallorca]] were going through a period of crisis and the amateur only responded to the big events, so during the rest of the year in the precinct was practiced all kinds of sports, especially the [[football]].

=== Years of splendor ===

The first years of ''Tirador'' contributed decisively to the consolidation and development of the majorcan cycling fans and the emergence of the first local Spain champions from 1913. Since then, the Spanish track has been dominated by majorcan cyclists for decades, especially in the medium-depth category. Of this first time they emphasized [[Simó Febrer]] ''Guixer'' and [[Miquel Bover Salom]].

In 1920 the ''Veloz Sport Balear'' planned to replace the runway with a covered velodrome of greater capacity and functionality due to the success of the contested events, similar to [[Vélodrome d'Hiver]] of Paris (the [[Vél d'Hiv]]); but nothing happened and the track survived.{{sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=51}}

Between 1921 and 1925 ''Tirador'' was closed by a federative sanction, but upon reopening it regained its leadership in Spanish track cycling without problems. Successively they were appearing tracks in Spain that could be an alternative, like the [[Campo de Ciudad Lineal|Velodrome of Ciudad Lineal]] ([[Madrid]]), the velodrome annexed to [[Estadio Torrero]] ([[Zaragoza]]) or the velodrome of [[Sants]] ([[Barcelona]]), which hosted several editions of the Spanish National of Track Cycling Championships in 1920s and 1930s; but for various reasons all were of short duration, which left successively ''Tirador'' as the only reference.

During the [[Spanish Civil War]] ''Tirador'' was practically inactive, but suffered no material damage. At the end of the war, he recovered his activity with equal or greater force and, except for specific periods, during the 1940s and 1950s his cycling activity was constant at all levels. During these years the competition of foreign cyclists was scarce, first by the [[Second World War]] and then by the diplomatic isolation of the country. These years highlighted the majorcan runners [[Miquel Llompart]] and the own [[Bartomeu Flaquer]].

During those years, new clues appeared in [[Campos, Mallorca|Campos]] (1935), [[Tortosa]] (1943), [[Mataró]] (1948) and others of shorter voyage, which hosted important events and official championships with assiduity, but without ever moving the [[Palma de Mallorca|Palma]] track as the main reference.

The victory of the majorcan [[Guillermo Timoner|Guillem Timoner]] in the [[1955 UCI Track Cycling World Championships|1955 World Championship]] held in [[Milan]] was an accolade for the track, which since then entered the circuit of great tracks of the world attracted by the local champion, regular runner on the track.{{sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=76}} This also coincided with a generation of majorcan cyclists who achieved international relevance and helped to consolidate the international range of ''Tirador'' like [[Pere Josep Gomila]], [[Josep Escalas]], [[Francisco Tortellá|Francesc Tortella]] or the [[1965 UCI Track Cycling World Championships|1965 world champion]], [[Miguel Mas (cyclist)|Miquel Mas]].{{Sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=121}}

From the 1950s periodically projects were created to replace the velodrome with other facilities of greater capacity and functionality, once the worst postwar years were overcome and because of their gradual aging. In spite of this, nothing ever materialized and the track survived. The moment of greatest risk was the ambitious municipal project planned in 1960s by the mayor Màxim Alomar to cover the torrent of ''sa Riera'' that crosses the city and passed by the side of the track, but that was finally discarded due to its high cost.{{sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=79}}

=== Decay and closure ===

The opening of the [[Velódromo de Anoeta]] ([[San Sebastián]]) in 1965, with the celebration of the [[1965 UCI Track Cycling World Championships|World Championships]] the same year, marked the beginning of its decline. From then on ''Tirador'' ceased to be the reference track in Spain and entered a process of irreversible decadence. It stopped receiving first level tests from 1968 (it would still host official Spanish National Championships until 1972), its increasing deterioration and the generalized loss of interest in track competitions to the detriment of road cycling forced its definitive closure in March 1973. The last rehabilitation projects in collaboration with the Spanish or Balearic federations did not succeed and the construction of a new velodrome in the neighboring town of [[Algaida]] in 1975 buried it definitively in oblivion.{{Sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=86}}

Since then its owners, a ''Veloz Sport Balear'' in low hours, dedicated the land to other uses. In 1999, [[paddle]] courts were built in the central space and a parking lot for the users, for which the runway was mutilated at the height of one of the cantons to allow access for the vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=El deporte vuelve a dar vida al Tirador. La sociedad Veloz Sport ha construido cuatro pistas de pádel|url=https://ultimahora.es/noticias/local/1999/10/25/942027/el-deporte-vuelve-a-dar-vida-al-tirador.html|date=25 October 1999|newspaper=Última Hora |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; And shortly after, another velodrome space was enabled as a municipal vehicle depot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=El fin del histórico velódromo del Tirador.

=== Expropriation and rehabilitation ===

Since 1990s the municipal government planned the construction of a large green area in the torrent of ''sa Riera'' called ''sa Falca Verda'' (The Green Wedge).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Las obras de la futura Falca Verda se iniciarán el próximo año y concluirán en 2014|url=https://ultimahora.es/noticias/local/2003/07/24/712535/las-obras-de-la-futura-falca-verda-se-iniciaran-el-proximo-ano-y-concluiran-en-2014.html|date=24 July 2003|newspaper=Última Hora|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the park contemplated the disappearance of the track, except for the ''Xalet'' of [[Gaspar Bennazar]]. In 2007 a first phase of the park was inaugurated and the expropriation procedures were continued for the second, among whose land was ''Tirador''. The judicial appeals filed by the affected owners and the delay in their resolution meant that the expropriation of the velodrome was not completed until July 2015,{{sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=89}} although new resources did not make it final until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=El velódromo de Tirador ya es de propiedad municipal|url=https://www.diariodemallorca.es/palma/2017/10/21/velodromo-tirador-propiedad-municipal/1257248.html |date=21 October 2017|newspaper=Diario de Mallorca|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those years a series of articles in the press made known the idiosyncrasy of the track and its value, social, historical and heritage. This helped to spread the importance of ''Tirador'' among those who were unaware of its existence, or recovered it for those old fans who believed that it had disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=El velòdrom del Tirador, patrimoni oblidat de Palma|url=https://www.diariodemallorca.es/opinion/2014/06/16/velodrom-tirador-patrimoni-oblidat-palma/940287.html|date=16 June 2014|newspaper=Diario de Mallorca|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=El Veloz, la pista más antigua de España|url=https://www.diariodemallorca.es/suscriptor/almudaina/2015/11/08/veloz-pista-antigua-espana/1069161.html|date=10 November 2015|newspaper=Diario de Mallorca|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=El Velódromo del Tirador y el patrimonio urbano de Palma|url=https://www.diariodemallorca.es/opinion/2016/11/02/velodromo-tirador-patrimonio-urbano-palma/1162129.html|date=2 November 2016|newspaper=Diario de Mallorca|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=La recuperación del canódromo y el velódromo.

In any case, for the expropriation the initial project of ''sa Falca Verda'' had already been ruled out: the municipal government decided to discard the initial design for another one that maintained the historic installation integrated in a future green area together with the solar annex of the ''Canòdrom Balear'' (an old [[Greyhound racing|greyhound]] track).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cort creará un bosque en pleno centro de Palma|url=https://ultimahora.es/noticias/local/2015/12/29/170849/cort-creara-bosque-pleno-centro-palma.html|date=29 December 2015|newspaper=Última Hora|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=New city centre park for Palma |url=https://majorcadailybulletin.com/news/local/2015/12/30/42497/palma-have-new-city-centre-park.html|date=30 December 2015|newspaper=Majorca Daily Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, in October 2015 its cataloging was announced as a heritage asset and its inclusion in the catalog of protected buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=El Ayuntamiento de Palma catalogará y rehabilitará el antiguo velódromo del Tirador|url=http://www.europapress.es/illes-balears/noticia-ayuntamiento-palma-catalogara-rehabilitara-antiguo-velodromo-tirador-20151020150026.html|date=20 October 2015|newspaper=Europa Press|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cort cataloga y recupera para la ciudad el antiguo velódromo del Tirador|url=http://agencias.abc.es/agencias/noticia.asp?noticia=2010390|date=20 October 2015|newspaper=ABC|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cort rehabilitará el antiguo velódromo del Tirador|url=https://ultimahora.es/noticias/local/2015/10/20/164677/cort-rehabilitra-antiguo-velodromo-del-tirador.html|date=20 October 2015|newspaper=Última Hora|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently (2018) its cataloging has not yet taken place and the preliminary draft of the velodrome rehabilitation is in the drafting phase.

In 2018 a book of historical character was presented that compiles the history of the velodrome, from the origins to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Un llibre escrit per Manel García recorda la mítica pista de ciclisme de Palma|url=https://www.arabalears.cat/cultura/Manel-Garcia-recorda-ciclisme-Palma_0_2007399458.html |date=2 May 2018|newspaper=ARA Balears|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=El velódromo de Tirador, una historia recuperada|url=https://www.diariodemallorca.es/opinion/2018/05/15/velodromo-tirador-historia-recuperada/1313227.html|date=15 May 2018|newspaper=Diario de Mallorca|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=La historia del velódromo del Tirador se presenta hoy en ARCA|url=https://www.diariodemallorca.es/palma/2018/11/07/historia-velodromo-tirador-presenta-hoy/1363039.html|date=7 November 2018|newspaper=Diario de Mallorca|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==


The track of ''Tirador'' has a rope of 333.33 m and 6 m wide, with two solid concrete banks (facing East and West) and bleachers on each side of the straight lines: main (North) and general (South), with capacity for approximately 2,000 spectators. Due to the elongated nature of the land acquired by the ''Veloz Sport Balear'', the ellipse of the track is longer than normal to adapt to the perimeter of the farm: its straights have a longer route and their supers are more closed normal, in addition to more inclined to compensate for its pronounced curvature. As a result, the central space has an approximate area of 110 by 33.3 m.{{Sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=29}}

In 1918 the architect [[Gaspar Bennazar]] added a building annexed to the [[Ponente]] canton in the form of a temple called ''es Xalet'' (the Chalet), covered tribune that served of cafeteria and terrace for the members and located in such a way that it offered a privileged perspective of the cyclist tests that were disputed there. In the 1970s it was renovated to house the social premises of the ''Veloz Sport Balear''.{{Sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=50}}

Since its closure in 1973 the work as a whole (track, steps and ''Xalet'') was progressively degraded. Even so, the quality of the construction has meant that it is only superficial and that the whole structure remains intact. At the beginning of the 1990s a vial was opened that carried the wall and part of the entrance gardens, but did not affect the rest of the group.{{Sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=89}}

== Events ==

From its opening to its closure the track hosted official events regularly and is probably the track that most official championships of Spain and [[Balearic Islands]] has hosted.

=== International competitions ===

''Tirador'' organized tests with foreign runners very soon, since the first one went back to 1906.{{sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=36}} Although the participation of very first figures had to wait for the 1950s, thanks to the successes of whoever was six times [[UCI Motor-paced World Championships]] between 1955 and 1965, the majorcan [[Guillermo Timoner|Guillem Timoner]].{{sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=149}}

On several occasions he chose to host the old [[UEC European Track Championships|European Championship]], and even a [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships|World Championship]]. But it never succeeded, mainly due to the lack of resources of the [[Royal Spanish Cycling Federation]] to confront the company and the superiority of other countries in the economic sphere, logistics and sports. Also other factors, such as the outbreak of [[World War I]], prevented his candidacy for the 1915 European and the 1917 World Championship from prospering.{{Sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=140}}

=== National competitions ===

Since its inauguration, the velodrome has gained great prestige nationwide and regularly hosted the Spanish National Championships of sprint (since 1904) and Spanish National Championships of Motor-Paced (from 1908). Later he would do the same with the different modalities that arose, especially, from 1940s: Commercial Motor-Paced (1941) or Pursuit (1949), both in professional and amateur categories in all cases.{{Sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=141}}

=== Regional competitions ===

The Balearic Championship of Sprint was held for its inauguration, and since then it has been regularly held there. Balearic Championship of Long-distance since its creation in 1912, as well as the rest of the modalities that emerged later as in the national case. In this case ''Tirador'' had to rival the profusion of tracks of [[Mallorca]], especially with the [[Campos (velodrome)|velodrome of Campos]].

=== Women's Cycling ===

During the years of activity of ''Tirador'' the tests were carried out only by male cyclists. The exception was the visit of the Italian [[Alfonsina Strada]], a pioneer of women's cycling in her time, who ran in 1926.{{sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=56}}

No official women's events were organized, since they began to be held at [[Mallorca]] starting 1979 and the regional championships on track starting the following year, when the velodrome had already been closed.

=== Other sports ===

When the track was built, cycling was the only sport with certain roots; the practice of other sports was still scarce and there were hardly any spaces for their practice. This turned ''Tirador'' into the main sports space in which the majority of sports developed as they arrived on the island.{{Sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=31}}

* [[Sport of athletics|Athletics]]. Since 1917 tests of pedestrism were disputed and also in the following years.
* [[Basketball]]. He started playing in 1938 on an outdoor track. The ''Veloz Sport Balear'' had a team federated between 1942 and 1945 that played in this space.
* [[Boxing]]. Although this sport was developed in other spaces of the city as of 1930s, some fighting was initially disputed on the track. The exhibition of the former heavyweight world champion, [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], in 1917 stands out.
* [[Football]]. It came to [[Mallorca]] in 1903 and the central space of ''Tirador'' was the only existing playing field in [[Palma de Mallorca|Palma]] for years. The football section of the ''Veloz Sport Balear'' was the most powerful team on the island until the birth of [[RCD Mallorca]] in 1916 and the construction that same year of the first regulatory playing field. There he played his first game on ''Baleares FC'' (currently [[CD Atlético Baleares]]) in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=El Veloz Sport Balear, decano del fútbol balear|url=http://www.cihefe.es/cuadernosdefutbol/2017/01/el-veloz-sport-balear-decano-del-futbol-balear/|date=January 2017|newspaper=CIHEFE|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Motorcycling]]. Motorcycle tests were disputed, especially in the early years of the track.
* Other sports: [[Roller Skating]], [[Tennis]], [[Pigeon shooting]].

=== Social acts ===

Apart from the sports slope, the velodrome was a social meeting point as it is the main outdoor space suitable for mass events. Verbenas, concerts and shows were common, especially during the first third of the 20th century.

== Patrimonial value ==

''Tirador'' is the oldest cycling track in Spain. It is followed by the velodrome of [[Campos, Mallorca|Campos]] (1935) and further away the tracks of [[Tortosa]] (1943) and [[Mataró]] (1948). At the moment it is the oldest sport enclosure that is conserved in [[Mallorca]].

At the world level, it is the 12th oldest runway on the planet (see [[List of cycling tracks and velodromes#List of oldest cycling tracks and velodromes|List of oldest cycling tracks and velodromes]]), surpassed only by four [[United Kingdom]] velodromes (built between 1877 and 1900), six of [[France]] (between 1884 and 1897) and one of [[Hungary]] (1896). All of them are in use and, for this reason, they have been modernized to varying degrees for their use; instead, ''Tirador'' is preserved almost as when it was inaugurated in 1903.{{sfn|García Gargallo|2018|p=135}}

The frustration of projects for its extension or substitution (first) and the relative abandonment (after) in the 1950s were already qualified to the track as old-made that ''Tirador'' remained almost unchanged as is since its inauguration, except surface arrangements for its basic maintenance.

The City Council of Palma, in municipal plenary of 29 May 2014, unanimously approved a proposal for the patrimonial cataloging of the building adjoining the velodrome (the ''Xalet'') and the conservation of the track in a future public space. However, the cataloging did not materialize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Més pide que se catalogue y proteja la pista del velódromo de Tirador|url=https://www.diariodemallorca.es/palma/2014/05/20/mes-pide-catalogue-proteja-pista/933811.html|date=May 20, 2014|newspaper=Diario de Mallorca|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=54.

== Deadly accidents ==

During the 70 years of activity of the velodrome there were a total of five fatalities:

* Antoni Parets Coll, 21 August 1927 when, as a motor-paced rider, he drove a cyclist Gaspar Pocoví in a race.
* [[José Nicolau|Josep Nicolau i Balaguer]] nicknamed ''es Canó de Llorito'' (the cannon of Llorito), 18 November 1934 (26 years old), when the Spanish National of Track Cycling Motor-Paced Championships was run.
* [[Rafael Pou|Rafel Pou Sastre]], 27 May 1936 (27 years old), when training after a motorcycle.
* [[Pere Bover Pons]], son of [[Miquel Bover Salom]] ''es Sardiner'', 15 May 1940 (18 years old), when he was fighting a race American style.
* [[Willy Lauwers]] ([[Belgium]]), 12 April 1959 (22 years old), in a motor-paced race.

'''''Villa Paletti''''' is a [[board game]] of [[game of physical skill|physical skill]] designed by Bill Payne and published in 2001 by [[Zoch Verlag]].  Players compete to build the [[villa]] highest using columns from lower floors without collapsing the structure.

A double-size version of the game, ''Palazzo Paletti'', is also available.

== Gameplay ==
Each player chooses a colour (in the case of two-player games, each player chooses two colours).  They then take their wooden column pieces - three thin, one medium, and one wide - and arrange them on the base mat.  The players must then agree on a fair placement of the first "floor", which must lie completely above the base mat and which cannot partially cover any column.

Each player in turn must take one of their columns from any level except the highest, and place it on the highest floor.  If they cannot remove one of their columns, they may ask to place the next floor.  Each opponent may challenge this decision; if they choose to do so and are successful, they may remove that piece from play, and the player misses their go.  If no opponent challenges the player, they may place the next floor on top of the pillars of the current highest floor - again, it must lie completely above the base mat and cannot partially cover any column.

Once a column is placed on the second floor, the player with the most column points (one for thin, two for medium, three for large) on the highest level is the leader.  If the tower is collapsed by any other player, the leader has won; if they collapse the tower, the previous leader wins.  If the tower collapses before a column is placed on the second floor, or if the first leader collapses the tower, no-one has won.

== Awards ==
''Villa Paletti'' won the [[Spiel des Jahres]] 2002, the [[Games 100]] Top dexterity award, the Tric Trac gold medal 2001, Belgian game of the year 2003, finalist in Switzerland, Japan, Finland and more.  The [[San Francisco Chronicle]] picked it as their top game for 2004.

'''Arthur L. Williams Stadium''' is a 25,000 seat football stadium located on the campus of [[Liberty University]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], USA. The stadium was built in 1989 and plays host to Liberty Flames football, which is a part of the NCAA Division I - Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). A new field house has recently been constructed at the north end of the stadium. This new facility houses a new home locker room, coaches offices, meeting rooms and training facility as well as a {{convert|16000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} weight room. In the 2009 off season, Liberty University added a video scoreboard on  the north end of the field. The video scoreboard measured {{convert|20|ft|m|0}} tall and {{convert|36|ft|m}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty.edu/news/index.cfm?PID=18495&amp;MID=9279|publisher=liberty.edu|title=New high-definition scoreboard installed at Williams Stadium|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This video board was replaced by a massive new high-definition video board in time for the 2018 football season.  

In September 2011, a ribbon video board was added to the facade of the upper deck.  This too was replaced by a state of the art ribbon video board on both the eastern and western facades of the upper deck in 2018.  

The stadium was named in 1994 to honor [[Arthur L. Williams, Jr.]] who was a major contributor to the University.&lt;ref name="Stadium Quick Facts"/&gt;

==Expansion==
Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr. announced on August 28, 2009 a three phase addition to Williams Stadium. The plan was to increase the seating capacity of the stadium from 12,000 seats to 30,000. The first phase of the construction included a five story press box and expanded the stadium by 7,200 seats. This was done by adding a second deck to the home side of the stadium and lengthening the east and west stands of the stadium. The seating capacity was 19,200 after phase one was completed. The estimated cost for the first phase of the project was $18 million.
The new press tower was ready for Liberty's Oct. 2, 2010 home game against Savannah State. The tower includes 18 luxury suites, all of which were sold for the 2010 season.

Phase two has added a second deck to the student side, which has increased capacity to 25,000, beginning with the 2018 football season. The estimated cost for the second phase of the project was $40 million. Phase three will complete a "horseshoe" around the south end zone, bringing the total capacity to 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiumjourney.com/stadiums/williams-stadium-s1804/|publisher=stadiumjourney.com|title=Williams Stadium|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams Stadium has the potential to be expanded past 60,000 in the future.
