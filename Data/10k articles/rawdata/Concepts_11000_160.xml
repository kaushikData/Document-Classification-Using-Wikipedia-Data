      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">The '''Abraham Lincoln School for Social Science''' in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] was a "broad,
nonpartisan school for workers, writers, and their sympathizers," aimed at the thousands of [[African-American]] workers who had migrated to Chicago from the [[American South]] during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mail-archive.com/marxism-thaxis%40lists.econ.utah.edu/msg00940.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=4332552 |author=P. Magg |volume=6 |number=4 |date=Autumn 1944 |pages=632–644 |work=The Kenyon Review |title=Education for the Age of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional history==

The Abraham Lincoln School for Social Science was founded by prominent civil rights activist and attorney [[William L. Patterson]], who had organized the defense of the [[Scottsboro Boys]].

The Lincoln School was among the first to offer a [[jazz]] history course, taught by [[Frank Marshall Davis]], in 1945.  In April 1947, it sponsored “Chicago Salutes Paul Robeson” at the Civic Opera House, where Lena Horne and others paid tribute to famed singer and civil rights activist [[Paul Robeson]].  Robeson's outspoken support of civil rights and the labor movement, and criticism of American foreign policy, had led to government scrutiny and resulting in his [[blacklisting]] by many concert halls.&lt;ref&gt;http://bayarearobeson.org/Chronology_5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards, the school was accused of being an adjunct of the [[Communist Party USA]] by Attorney General [[Tom C. Clark]] in December 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Attorney General Tom Clark, letter to Loyalty Review Board, released December 4, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; again in the 1948 by the [[California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities]]&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Report Un-American Activities in California 1948, page 95, titled 'Abraham Lincoln School'&lt;/ref&gt; and a target of [[HUAC]] during the years leading up to [[McCarthy Era]].&lt;ref&gt;United States.

Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Faculty members included Morris Backall, Michael Baker, [[Frank Marshall Davis]], [[Horace Davis]], David Englestein, Morton Goldsholl, Pat Hoverder, [[Alfonso Iannelli]], Leon Katzen, Ludwig Kruhe, Herschel Meyer, Henry Noyes, [[William L. Patterson]], Fred Ptashne, Eleanore Redwin, Boris M. Revsine, Frank Sokolik, William Rose, Herman Schendel, [[Bernice Targ]], and Morris Topchevsky. A notice appearing in a catalog of the school stated that "prominent citizens participating in our efforts" include [[Paul Robeson]], [[Rockwell Kent]], [[Lee Pressman]], [[Howard Fast]], [[Albert E. Kahn]], and [[Henrietta Buckmaster]].

'''Atopy''' ([[greek language|Greek]] ''ατοπία, atopía - placelessness, unclassifiable, of high [[original]]ity''; [[Socrates]] has often been called "átopos") describes the [[ineffability]] of things or emotions that are seldom experienced, that are outstanding and that are original in the strict sense. The term depicts a certain quality (of experience) that can be observed within oneself or within others. It does not depict an [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]], although it has been abused to do so, for example by the ''genius-cult'' during the era of [[romanticism]].

== Phenomenon, origin ==

A human being in love, no matter at whom or what his adoration and affection is pointed at&amp;mdash;be it a beloved person, a god in some mystical sense or an idol&amp;mdash;is not able to reduce the "item" of his love down to certain [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s, he claims his "obscure object of desire" to be unique and incomparable.

The [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]] of characteristics from the banal everyday world would, in the eye of the one being seriously in love, mean betrayal ([[sacrilege]]) to the very own love itself. Up until now, no one has managed to describe and analyze this more strikingly than [[Roland Barthes]] in his famous and acclaimed collection of [[essay]]s ''[[A Lover's Discourse: Fragments]]'', published in 1977. But if you look at it more closely, this is an everyday phenomenon each and every mere mortal is encountering: parents can describe, praise or curse the relation between them and their children&amp;mdash;but they realize at the same time that the depth and the profoundness of their feelings for their offspring are atopical, or ineffable.

Natural religions, like [[mysticism]], therefore talk about "[[Tao]]", about the "original" and the "pristine"; in the field of ontological philosophy and  theology it is called "richness of being". The rather sensual, mundane and secular poetry speaks of [[cornucopia]] (also see: [[cornucopian]]), or, more prosaically of "[[artistic inspiration|inspiration]]". In the field of science, especially in psychological sciences, this phenomenon is being researched under the leading definition of [[creativity]] or as [[Flow (psychology)|"Flow"]].

== Occurrence ==

Most adults are familiar with atopy, having experienced the view on the world through "rose-tinted glasses" in phases of [[limerence]]. Art lovers know it as [[genius]] and as something auratic, readers as "Thou shalt not make for thyself an idol" in [[Max Frisch]]'s "Stiller", which refers to the notion of God from the "Ten Commandments", or "Geschichten von Herrn Keuner" by [[Bertold Brecht]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6212">'''Avalon Organic Gardens &amp; EcoVillage''' also known as Avalon Gardens, is a [[sustainable community]] and [[ecovillage]] started in 1994 by [[Global Community Communications Alliance]]. The ecovillage is located in [[Tumacacori, Arizona]], south of [[Tubac, Arizona]] in the Santa Cruz Valley and consists of over 100 residents. Its sustainable practices include [[recycling]], [[compost]]ing, [[organic gardening]], [[rainwater harvesting]], [[greywater]] recycling, [[alternative energy]] sources, [[eco-architecture]], [[resource management]], and [[Sustainability#Management of human consumption|human consumption management]].

==History and vision==
Avalon Gardens was started in 1994 in northern [[Arizona]], USA. In 2007 the ecovillage moved to the Potreros Ranch in Tumacacori, neighboring the [[Mission San José de Tumacácori]] (Tumacacori Mission), started by Father [[Eusebio Kino]] in 1691. The ecovillage incorporates some of the traditional agricultural practices employed by the Tumacacori ranchers and farmers in former decades as well as newer [[permaculture]] methods. They plan to extend their facilities and housing to accommodate visiting and resident [[WWOOF]]ers, students, and workshop participants.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Milinovich “New Neighbors”, The Villager June/July 2007, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and development==

===Organic gardening===
Avalon Gardens has a year-round organic food production system that involves [[greenhouse]]s, [[garden bed]]s and [[forest gardening]], [[drip irrigation]], soil composting and development, [[food preservation]], and [[seed saving]]. Avalon Gardens locally participates in the [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA) program,&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Vandervoet, “Avalon Organic Gardens, Farm, and Ranch Harvests Organic Produce Locally” Santa Cruz Valley Sun, August 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; being the first established in the state of Arizona. Their “Hands In The Soil” mornings are organized for public participation in [[organic gardening]] at the ecovillage, and workshops and tours are held regularly for public education and training. The gardens also supplies vegetables to the Food For Ascension Café, an organic [[vegan]]-[[vegetarian]] and [[slow food]] movement restaurant in Tucson.

===Water harvesting===
Water harvesting is important to the ecovillage because they are located in desert climate. At the ecovillage, rainwater is collected from house rooftops and water-catchment tanks. Thousands of gallons of run-off rainwater are redirected and stored to water high-water use trees, their [[food forest]], gardens, and [[pasture]]s. Through a greywater system, water is harvested from washing machines, indoor and outdoor showers, and house sinks and basins. This water is used to water flower beds, trees, and plants around the homes.

Rainwater harvesting has become significant in view of the realization that water has become scarce and it is becoming a critical problem globally. In big cities large residencies are required to have a rainwater harvesting system. For the present, drains are being constructed with conventional materials such as brick and [[stonemasonry]] and R.C.C. side drains. Rain water is made to flow through these drains to a centralized water storage tank. Water from this tank is designated for nondomestic and gardening purposes. The water storage tank is of brick masonry or R.C.C. The drains for the flow of rainwater and the tank for the storage of rainwater can be constructed using [[Ferrocement]] technology. Ferrocement drains are machine-made, precast products about 2.4 to 5 meters long with covers and perforations of the same length at about 25&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The surfaces of these drains are known to be strong and not easily eroded by the flow of water. The bottom and sides of the water storage tanks consist of ferrocement plates with space frames. These plates are about 25&amp;nbsp;mm thick, waterproof, strong, durable, and low-maintenance.

===Energy-efficient building===
The ecovillage uses sustainable, renewable, and recycled building materials in their building and construction projects. Paper and cardboard products are reused by blending them into a fiber pulp that is mixed with cement, poured into molds, and dried. This reused paper-cement mix is called [[papercrete]], and the blocks are used as building material for walls, benches, flower beds, and other types of structures. Some of the sustainable dwellings at Avalon Gardens include earth domes, [[monolithic domes]], yurts, and Eco-friendly houses.

===Sustainable transport &amp; sharing resources===
To reduce their [[ecological footprint]], noise and air pollution, ecovillage residents [[carpool]], group-transit, bike, walk, and use other means of [[sustainable transport]]. Assigned shoppers buy food and supplies in bulk, and designated shuttle drivers make daily pickups and deliveries for over 100 residents.

Ecovillage residents share resources like vehicles, washing machines, and household appliances to make the most and best use of them. One of their facilities is a community kitchen and dining room where most of the meals are prepared and served for the entire community. Bio-friendly cleaning products and personal care products are also used to avoid water and environmental contamination.

== Eight components ==

The earliest classical Sanskrit works on Ayurveda describe medicine as being divided into eight components (Skt. ''aṅga'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Suśrutasaṃhitā|publisher = Nirṇayasāgara Press|year = 1945|isbn = |location = Bombay|pages = 2–3|url = https://archive.org/stream/sushrutasamhita/sushruta_samhita_critical#page/n229/mode/2up|editor-last = Ācārya|editor-first = Yādava Trivikramātmaja|chapter = Sūtrasthāna 1.7-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Carakasaṃhitā of Caraka, with the commentary by Cakrapāṇidatta, edited by Yadavaśarman Trivikarama Ācārya|publisher = Nirṇayasāgara Press|year = 1941|isbn = |location = Bombay|pages = 189|editor-last = Ācārya|editor-first = Yādava Trivikramātmaja|chapter = Sūtrasthāna 30.28|url = https://archive.org/stream/TheCarakasahitOrCharakasamhitaOfCarakaEditedByYadavaarman/Carakasamhita-Trikamji1941#page/n253/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This characterization of the physicians' art, "the medicine that has eight components" (Skt.

The word "ayurveda" is {{lang-sa|[[:wikt:आयुर्वेद|आयुर्वेद]]}}, {{IAST|''Āyurveda''}}, meaning knowledge of life and longevity.&lt;ref name="GregoryFields"&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious Therapeutics: Body and Health in Yoga, Ayurveda, and Tantra|publisher=SUNY Press|author=Gregory P.

The central theoretical ideas of Ayurveda developed in the mid-first millennium BCE, and show parallels with [[Sāṅkhya]] and [[Vaiśeṣika]] philosophies, as well as with [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Studies on Indian Medical History|last = Comba|first = Antonella|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Delhi|pages = 39–55|editor-last = Meulenbeld|editor-first = G.

Ayurveda names seven basic tissues ([[Dhatu (Ayurveda)|dhatu]]), which are plasma (''rasa''), blood (''rakta''), muscles (''māmsa''), fat (''meda''), bone (''asthi''), [[Bone marrow|marrow]] (''majja''), and semen (''shukra''). Like the medicine of classical antiquity, Ayurveda has historically divided bodily substances into five [[Classical element#Classical elements in Hinduism|classical elements]], (Sanskrit) ''[[panchamahabhuta]]'', viz. [[Prithvi|earth]], [[Ap (water)|water]], [[Agni|fire]], [[Vayu|air]] and [[ether (classical element)|ether]].&lt;ref name="Underwood&amp;Rhodes(2008)" /&gt; There are also twenty [[guna]]s (qualities or characteristics) which are considered to be inherent in all matter. These are organized in ten pairs: heavy/light, cold/hot, unctuous/dry, dull/sharp, stable/mobile, soft/hard, non-slimy/slimy, smooth/coarse, minute/gross, and viscous/liquid.&lt;ref name="Chopra76"&gt;{{harvnb|Chopra|2003|p=76}}, citing Sushrutasamhita 25.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ama (a [[Sanskrit]] word meaning "uncooked" or "undigested" ) is used to refer to the concept of anything that exists in a state of incomplete transformation. With regards to [[oral hygiene]], it is claimed to be a toxic byproduct generated by improper or incomplete [[digestion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ayurvedic Tongue Diagnosis |chapter=Ama and Disease |last=Kacera |first=Walter |pages=159–176 |year=2007 |publisher=Lotus Press |isbn=978-0-940985-77-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijdr.in/article.asp?issn=0970-9290;year=2008;volume=19;issue=1;spage=52;epage=61;aulast=Amruthesh Dentistry and Ayurveda - IV: Classification and management of common oral diseases]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=09709290&amp;AN=26214672&amp;h=GMGOeADM0ninrhhxr%2fSXhfQeebinOTF7ejtyDiosA5NtRLAqkL5aoJRGYL%2f6N7kdeYs%2fKaM6HfhKIV1OtQA2eA%3d%3d&amp;crl=c Dentistry and Ayurveda--III (basics - ama, immunity, ojas, rasas, etiopathogenesis and prevention)]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has no equivalent in [[standard medicine]]. 

Ayurveda also names three elemental bodily humors, the ''doshas'' (called Vata, Pitta and Kapha), and states that a balance of the doshas results in health, while imbalance results in disease. One Ayurvedic view is that the doshas are balanced when they are equal to each other, while another view is that each human possesses a unique combination of the doshas which define this person's temperament and characteristics. In either case, it says that each person should modulate their behavior or environment to increase or decrease the doshas and maintain their natural state.

In medieval taxonomies of the Sanskrit knowledge systems, Ayurveda is assigned a place as a subsidiary [[Veda]] ([[upaveda]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madhusūdanasarasvatī|title=प्रस्थानभेदः श्रीमधुसूदनसरस्वत्या विरचितः|date=1912|publisher=श्रीवाणिविलासमुद्रायन्त्रालय|location=श्रीरङ्गम्|page=14|url=https://archive.org/stream/Prasthanabheda.by.Madhusudana.Sarasvati#page/n15/mode/2up|accessdate=16 October 2015|language=Sanskrit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some medicinal plant names  from the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' and other Vedas can be found in subsequent Ayurveda literature.&lt;ref name="zysk-veda"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zysk|first1=Kenneth G.|title=Medicine in the {Veda}: Religious Healing in the {Veda} with Translations and Annotations of Medical Hymns from the {Rgveda and the Atharvaveda} and Renderings from the Corresponding Ritual Texts|date=2010|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8120814011}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded theoretical statements about the canonical models of disease in Ayurveda occur in the earliest [[Buddhist Canon]].&lt;ref name="zysk-asce"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zysk|first1=Kenneth G.|title=Asceticism and Healing in Ancient {India}: Medicine in the {Buddhist} Monastery|date=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-208-1507-0}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Ayurvedic doctors regard physical existence, mental existence, and personality as a unit, with each element being able to influence the others.{{clarify|date=January 2015}} This is a [[Holism#Medicine|holistic]] approach used during diagnosis and therapy, and is a fundamental aspect of Ayurveda. Another part of Ayurvedic treatment says that there are channels (''srotas'') which transport fluids, and that the channels can be opened up by massage treatment using oils and [[Swedana]] (fomentation). Unhealthy, or blocked, channels are thought to cause disease.&lt;ref name="WujastykXIX-XX"&gt;{{harvnb|Wujastyk|2003|pages=XIX–XX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diagnosis ===
Ayurveda has eight ways to diagnose illness, called [[Nadi (yoga)|Nadi]] (pulse), Mootra (urine), [[Malas (Ayurveda)|Mala]] (stool), Jihva (tongue), Shabda (speech), Sparsha (touch), Druk (vision), and Aakruti (appearance).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Treatment and prevention ===
Two of the eight branches of classical Ayurveda deal with surgery (''Śalya-cikitsā'' and ''Śālākya-tantra''), but contemporary Ayurveda tends to stress attaining vitality by building a healthy [[metabolism|metabolic system]] and maintaining good [[digestion]] and [[excretion]].&lt;ref name="Chopra76" /&gt; Ayurveda also focuses on exercise, [[yoga]], and [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="encarta-ayurveda"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Encarta]]|year=2008|url= http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761596196/Ayurveda.html |publisher=[[Microsoft]]|location=Redmond, WA|title=Ayurveda|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028105549/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761596196/Ayurveda.html|archivedate=28 October 2009|author= Microsoft Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of prescription is a [[Sattvic diet]].

Ayurveda follows the concept of [[Dinacharya]], which says that natural cycles (waking, sleeping, working, meditation etc.) are important for health. Hygiene, including regular bathing, cleaning of teeth, [[tongue scraping]], skin care, and eye washing, is also a central practice.&lt;ref name="Underwood&amp;Rhodes(2008)" /&gt;

===Substances used===
Plant-based treatments in Ayurveda may be derived from roots, leaves, fruits, bark, or seeds such as [[cardamom]] and [[cinnamon]]. In the 19th century, William Dymock and co-authors summarized hundreds of plant-derived medicines along with the uses, microscopic structure, chemical composition, toxicology, prevalent myths and stories, and relation to commerce in [[British India]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/36345#page/1/mode/1up Pharmacographia Indica], A history of principal drugs of vegetable origin in British India - Volume 1, William Dymock et al. (1890), London&lt;/ref&gt; Animal products used in Ayurveda include milk, bones, and [[gallstone]]s. In addition, fats are prescribed both for consumption and for external use. Consumption of minerals, including [[sulphur]], [[arsenic]], lead, [[copper sulfate]] and gold, are also prescribed.&lt;ref name="Underwood&amp;Rhodes(2008)" /&gt; The addition of minerals to herbal medicine is called ''[[rasa shastra]]''.

Ayurveda uses alcoholic beverages called ''Madya'',&lt;ref name="IJTNJAN07"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sekar, S. |year=2007|title=Traditional alcoholic beverages from Ayurveda and their role on human health |journal=Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge |volume=6|issue=1|pages=144–149 |url=http://www.niscair.res.in/sciencecommunication/ResearchJournals/rejour/ijtk/Fulltextsearch/2007/January%202007/IJTK-Vol%206%281%29-January%202007-pp%20144-149.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218110751/http://www.niscair.res.in/sciencecommunication/ResearchJournals/rejour/ijtk/Fulltextsearch/2007/January%202007/IJTK-Vol%206%281%29-January%202007-pp%20144-149.htm |archivedate=18 December 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are said to adjust the doshas by increasing Pitta and reducing Vatta and Kapha.&lt;ref name="IJTNJAN07" /&gt; Madya are classified by the raw material and fermentation process, and the categories include: sugar-based, fruit-based, cereal-based, cereal-based with herbs, fermentated with vinegar, and tonic wines. The intended outcomes can include causing purgation, improving digestion or taste, creating dryness, or loosening joints. Ayurvedic texts describe Madya as non-viscid and fast-acting, and say that it enters and cleans minute pores in the body.&lt;ref name="IJTNJAN07" /&gt;

In this drug, the respiratory depressant action of opium is counteracted by the respiratory stimulant property of Camphor.&lt;ref name="IJHS051981" /&gt; Later books have included the narcotic property for use as analgesic pain reliever.&lt;ref name="IJHS051981" /&gt;

''[[Cannabis indica]]'' is also absent from the ancient Ayurveda books, and is first mentioned in the ''Sarngadhara Samhita'' as a treatment for diarrhea.&lt;ref name="IJHS051981" /&gt; In the ''Bhaisajya Ratnavali'' it is named as an ingredient in an aphrodisiac.&lt;ref name="IJHS051981" /&gt;

Ayurveda says that both oil and tar can be used to stop bleeding,&lt;ref name="Underwood&amp;Rhodes(2008)" /&gt; and that traumatic bleeding can be stopped by four different methods: [[ligature (medicine)|ligation]] of the [[blood vessel]], [[cauterisation]] by heat, use of preparations to facilitate [[Blood clot|clotting]], and use of preparations to [[Vasoconstriction|constrict]] the blood vessels. Oils are also used in a number of ways, including regular consumption, anointing, smearing, head massage, application to affected areas,&lt;ref name="WujastykXX"&gt;{{harvnb|Wujastyk|2003|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2015}} and [[oil pulling]]. Liquids may also be poured on the patient's forehead, a technique called [[shirodhara]].

The Sri Lankan tradition of Ayurveda is similar to the Indian tradition. Practitioners of Ayurveda in Sri Lanka refer to Sanskrit texts which are common to both countries. However, they do differ in some aspects, particularly in the herbs used.

In 1980, the Sri Lankan government established a Ministry of Indigenous Medicine to revive and regulate Ayurveda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayurveda.gov.lk/dept.html |title=Ministry of Indigenous Medicine |accessdate=2 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214094513/http://www.ayurveda.gov.lk/dept.html |archivedate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of Indigenous Medicine (affiliated to the [[University of Colombo]]) offers undergraduate, postgraduate, and MD degrees in Ayurveda Medicine and Surgery, and similar degrees in unani medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iim.cmb.ac.lk/ |title=Institute of indigenous Medicine |publisher=Iim.cmb.ac.lk |accessdate= 21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the public system, there are currently 62 Ayurvedic hospitals and 208 central dispensaries, which served about 3 million people (about 11% of Sri Lanka's population) in 2010.

According to the [[Mahavamsa]], an ancient chronicle of [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] royalty from the sixth century C.E., King [[Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka]] (reigned 437 BCE to 367 BCE) had lying-in-homes and Ayurvedic hospitals (Sivikasotthi-Sala) built in various parts of the country.

Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine developed during antiquity and the medieval period, and as such is comparable to pre-modern [[traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese]] and [[Medieval medicine of Western Europe|European]] systems of medicine. However, beginning in the 1960s, Ayurveda has been advertised as [[alternative medicine]] in the Western world. Due to different laws and medical regulations in the rest of the world, the unregulated practice and commercialisation of Ayurveda have raised ethical and legal issues. In some instances, Ayurvedic practices or terminology have also been adapted specifically for Western consumption, notably in the case of "[[Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health|Maharishi Ayurveda]]" in the 1980s. In some cases, this involved active fraud on the part of proponents of Ayurveda in an attempt to falsely represent the system as equal to the standards of modern [[medical research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Skolnick, Andrew A. | year = 1991 | title=The Maharishi Caper: Or How to Hoodwink Top Medical Journals | journal = ScienceWriters: The Newsletter of the National Association of Science Writers | issue = Fall | format = print | url = http://www.aaskolnick.com/naswmav.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080716041551/http://www.aaskolnick.com/naswmav.htm | archivedate=16 July 2008 |authorlink=Andrew A.

[[Baba Hari Dass]] was an early proponent who helped bring Ayurveda to the US in the early 1970s. He taught classes derived from the ''Suśrutha Saṃhitā'' and the ''Charaka Saṃhitha'', leading to the establishment of the [[Mount Madonna Institute]], College of Ayurveda, Ayurveda World, and Ayurvedic pharmacy.{{clarify|date=January 2015}} He invited several notable Ayurvedic teachers, including [[Vasant Lad]], Sarita Shrestha, and Ram Harsh Singh. The Ayurvedic practitioner Michael Tierra wrote that "[t]he history of Ayurveda in North America will always owe a debt to the selfless contributions of Baba Hari Dass."&lt;ref&gt;Karta Purkh Singh Khalsa and Michael Tierra: "Independently, we both first learned Ayurvedic medicine from our respective spiritual mentors – myself with Baba Hari Dass and K.P., with Yogi Bhajan."

In the United States, the practice of Ayurveda is not licensed or regulated by any state. Practitioners of Ayurveda can be licensed in other healthcare fields such as [[massage therapy]] or [[midwifery]], and a few states have approved schools teaching Ayurveda.&lt;ref name="nihintro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/ayurveda/introduction.htm|title=Ayurvedic Medicine: An Introduction|work=NCCIH|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification and efficacy==

Although laboratory experiments suggest it is possible that some substances in Ayurveda might be developed into effective treatments, there is no evidence that any are effective in themselves.&lt;ref name="ACS2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayurveda|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/mindbodyandspirit/ayurveda|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=7 January 2015|date=26 August 2011 |quote=The effectiveness of Ayurveda has not been proven in scientific studies, but early research suggests that certain herbs may offer potential therapeutic value|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222053347/http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/mindbodyandspirit/ayurveda|archive-date=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Cancer Research UK]], no significant scientific evidence has shown effectiveness of Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of any disease, although massage and relaxation are often beneficial for some cancer patients and there are indications from animal studies that some herbal products used in Ayurveda might be explored further.&lt;ref name="cruk"/&gt;

===Main texts===
There are three principal early texts on Ayurveda, the [[Charaka Samhita]], the [[Sushruta Samhita]] and the Bhela Samhita. The Sushruta Samhita is based on an original from the 6th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pharmacognosy: An Indian perspective|page=2|author=K.

The [[Bower Manuscript]] includes of excerpts from the Bheda Samhita&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Science and Technology in Ancient India: Formation of the theoretical fundamentals of natural science|page=153|author=Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its description of concepts in Central Asian Buddhism. In 1987, A. F. R. Hoernle identified the scribe of the medical portions of the manuscript to be a native of India using a northern variant of the Gupta script, who had migrated and become a Buddhist monk in a monastery in Kucha. The Chinese pilgrim [[Fa Hsien]] (c. 337–422 AD) wrote about the healthcare system of the Gupta empire (320–550) and described the institutional approach of Indian medicine. This is also visible in the works of Charaka, who describes  hospitals and how they should be equipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA543&amp;dq=Charaka+hospital#v=onepage&amp;q=Charaka%20hospital&amp;f=false|author=Upinder Singh|publisher=Pearson|year=2008|isbn=9788131711200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further development and spread===

Ayurveda flourished throughout the Indian Middle Ages. [[Dalhana]] (fl. 1200), Sarngadhara (fl. 1300) and Bhavamisra (fl. 1500) compiled works on Indian medicine.&lt;ref name="WujastykXXVI"&gt;{{harvnb|Wujastyk|2003|page=XXVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical works of both Sushruta and Charaka were also translated into the Chinese language in the 5th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Well-Mannered Medicine: Medical Ethics and Etiquette in Classical Ayurveda|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6-BoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=ayurveda+translated+5th+chinese+CE#v=onepage&amp;q=ayurveda%20translated%205th%20chinese%20CE&amp;f=false|author=Dagmar Wujastyk|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780199856275}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 8th century, they were translated into the Arabic and [[Persian language|Persian]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|publisher=Springer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kt9DIY1g9HYC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=|isbn=9781402045592|date=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 9th-century Persian physician [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] was familiar with the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ayurveda: The Gentle Health System|page=15|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|author=Hans H.

During the period of colonial British rule of India, the practice of Ayurveda was neglected by the British Indian Government, in favor of modern medicine. After Indian independence, there was more focus on Ayurveda and other traditional medical systems. Ayurveda became a part of the Indian National health care system, with state hospitals for Ayurveda established across the country. However, the treatments of traditional medicines were not always integrated with others.&lt;ref name="who01"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Status of Traditional Medicine and Complementary/Alternative Medicine: A Worldwide Review| publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO)|url= http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Jh2943e/8.4.html|accessdate=June 24, 2014|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beatriz Nascimento''' (12 July 1942-28 January 1995) was an [[Afro-Brazilians|Afro-Brazilian]] academic and activist. She was an influential participant of the [[Black Movement of Brazil]] from its beginnings in the 1960s until her death. Through her academic research, she evaluated the importance of ''[[quilombos]]'' as autonomous spaces for people of African descent during the colonial period and challenged the political environment and racial policies of the government toward Afro-Brazilians. Her scholarship on the invisibility of black women, and particularly non-Anglo women of the [[African diaspora]] had an international impact on research regarding the complexities of the black experience and lack of attention focused on Afro-Latinas in transnational feminism. 

==Early life==
Maria Beatriz do Nascimento was born on 12 July 1942 in [[Aracaju]], [[Sergipe]], Brazil to Rubina Pereira Nascimento and Francisco Xavier do Nascimento. Her father was a mason and her mother raised their ten children. Nascimento was their eighth child. Around 1949, the family migrated south and settled in the [[Cordovil]] neighborhood of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. After completing her secondary schooling, she enrolled at the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]] (UFRJ), graduating with a bachelor's degree in history in 1971. During her schooling, she became involved in the [[Black Movement of Brazil]] ({{lang-pt|Movimento Negro}}). Beginning as a student organizer, Nascimento was a co-founder of several associations and attended numerous conferences and public forum discussions on blackness and racial politics.{{sfn|Smith|2016}}

==Career==
Upon graduating, Nascimento began working as an intern at the [[Brazilian National Archives]] and continued her education, studying at the [[Fluminense Federal University]] (UFF). She married Jose do Rosario Freitas Gomes and the couple subsequently had a daughter, Bethânia Gomes. While at UFF, she was involved in the founding of the Andre Rebouças Working Group, which had a significant effect on the resurgence of black identity and the politicization of race under the [[Brazilian military government]] from 1974 to 1985.{{sfn|Smith|2016}} Her research during this period centered on [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies in three of the surviving  ''[[quilombos|quilombo communities]]'' (African-Brazilian Maroon societies) in [[Minas Gerais]]. Conducting interviews and evaluating archival materials, Nascimento came to recognize ''quilombos'' as "autonomous black spaces of liberation".{{sfn|Smith|2016}}

In 1977, Nascimento was one of the speakers at the ''Quinzena do Negro'' (Black Fortnight), organized by Eduardo Oliveira e Oliveira at the [[University of São Paulo]].{{sfn|Smith|2016}}{{sfn|Ratts|2006|p=11}} The conference was pivotal in Nascimento's development, and was where she secured her place as an anchor in the Black Movement,{{sfn|Ratts|2006|p=11}} through her introduction of theoretical ideas about the significance of ''quilombos'' for [[Afro-Brazilians]] and the intersection of race and gender in the political environment for black women in Brazil. She also strongly criticized the [[Brazilian Academy of Sciences]] for its racist policies. In 1978, she joined the [[Movimento Negro Unificado Contra a Discriminação Racial]] (Unified Black Movement, or MNU) and over the next decade worked with Raquel Gerber, a filmmaker, on a documentary which would become one of her most important legacies.{{sfn|Smith|2016}} 

Nascimento completed her graduate studies at UFF in 1981 and began a master's degree program at UFRJ studying communications with {{ill|Muniz Sodré|es}}, a noted Brazilian sociologist and journalist.{{sfn|Smith|2016}} She taught history at the Rome State School ({{lang-pt|Colégio Estadual Roma}}), in [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana]]{{sfn|Ratts|2006|p=27}}{{sfn|Torres|1995}} and published articles in various newspapers and journals like ''Estudos Afro-Asiáticos'' (Afro-Asian Studies), ''[[Folha de São Paulo]]'', ''Revista Cultura Vozes'' (Culture Voices Magazine), and ''Revista do Patrimônio Histórico'' (Historical Patrimony Magazine), while serving on the editorial board of ''Boletim do Centenário da Abolição e República'' (Centennial Bulletin of Abolition and the Republic).{{sfn|Ratts|2006|pp=27–28}} In 1989, Nascimento and Gerber released ''[[Ori (film)|Ori]]'',{{sfn|Smith|2016}} their documentary about the relationship between Africa and Brazil and the Black Movement in the country.{{sfn|Ratts|2006|p=28}}

==Death and legacy==
Nascimento was murdered on 28 January 1995 during a domestic dispute between Aurea and Antônio Jorge Amorim Viana, known as Danone.{{sfn|Torres|1995}} The murderer, Danone, believed that Nascimento had counseled his wife, Aurea to leave him because of their violent relationship.{{sfn|Torres|1995}}{{sfn|Gramado|1995}} At the time of her death Nascimento and Gomes had separated, and she was in relationship with Roberto Rosemburg, her common law spouse.{{sfn|Smith|2016}} She was buried on 30 January 1995 at the [[Cemitério de São João Batista]].{{sfn|Gramado|1995}} Nascimento impacted international scholarship on black women, calling into question their invisibility because of patriarchy and colonialism, but also because of the over-emphasis on the English-speaking diaspora among academics{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=72}} and the language barriers to intellectual discourse from non-Anglo scholars.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=74}} Nascimento caused feminist scholars to recognize the need for expanding research to encompass Afro-Latinas for a deeper understanding of the complexities impacting the African diaspora.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=85}} Aléx Ratts published a biography on Nascimento and her career, ''Eu Sou Atlântica'' in 2007.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=72}}

'''''Belgitude''''' is a term used to express the [[Belgium|Belgian]] soul and identity.

==Context==

Contrary to most other countries [[Belgians]] have a mixed feeling towards their identity as one people. This is a result of being occupied by many foreign European powers throughout the centuries, which led to an [[inferiority complex]] about their status and power in the world. The regions were conquered by [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Carolingian Empire|French]], [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgondia]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire|Austria-Hungary]], [[Napoleonic Empire|the French again]] and finally [[The Netherlands]] before becoming independent in [[1830]]. And even then they were occupied again by [[Germany|the Germans]] during the [[First World War]] and [[Second World War]]. Another aspect contributing to ''belgitude'' is the fact that many Belgians identify more with being [[Flanders|Flemish]], [[Wallonia|Walloon]] or part of [[Brussels]], but even within those groups many feel more attached to being part of a city or province than any national or community identity. There have been countless issues between the Flemish and Walloon [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|communities]] throughout Belgian history that often lead to intense political discussions and crisises in Belgian parliament.

The Belgian identity is seen as a "hollow" identity: it is defined mostly by what it is not. For example, the Belgian is neither [[French people|French]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]] or [[German people|German]]. At the time of the term's coinage, it was not accepted by the general population, and the term seemed to have "more cultural than political weight". At the time, belgitude could be synonymous with [[Marginalization|marginality]].&lt;ref name=bainbrigge /&gt; [[Susan Bainbrigge]] defines it as  "a term  that represents [the] new approach to [[francophone]] [[Belgium]] specificity [that emerged] in the 1970s and 1980s".&lt;ref name=bainbrigge&gt;{{cite book|last=Bainbrigge|first=Susan|title=Culture and identity in Belgian francophone writing: dialogue, diversity and displacement|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXY9keniD1UC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=Belgitude&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yAvdTrHYKefnmAXS15XCCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Belgitude&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involved the extent of the questioning identity of Belgians with the sense of self-mockery that characterizes them.

==History of the Belgian feeling of identity==

During his conquest of [[Gaul]] in 54 before Christ [[Julius Caesar]] wrote in his [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]] about the three Celtic tribes that inhabited the country, namely the ''[[Aquitani]]'' in the southwest, the ''[[Gauls]]'' of the biggest central part, who in their own language were called ''Celtae'', and the ''[[Belgae]]'' in the north. Caesar famously wrote that the [[Belgae]] were ''"the bravest of the three peoples, being farthest removed from the highly developed civilization of the Roman Province, least often visited by merchants with enervating luxuries for sale, and nearest to the Germans across the [[Rhine]], with whom they are continually at war"''.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''The Conquest of Gaul Gallico'', trans. S. A. Handford, revised with a new introduction by Jane F. Gardner (Penguin Books 1982), I.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Caesar referring to the Celtic tribe the Belgae and not modern day Belgium the quote was used a lot in Belgian history books from the 1830s on while the new independent state searched for its own identity.

The most famous quote about the Belgian identity was said by the Walloon socialist politician [[Jules Destrée]]. According to Destrée, Belgium was composed of two separate entities, [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]], and a feeling of [[Belgian nationalism]] was not possible, illustrated in his 1906 work "Une idée qui meurt: la patrie" (''An idea that is dying: the fatherland''). In the "Revue de Belgique" of 15 August 1912 he articulated this in his famous and notorious "Lettre au roi sur la séparation de la Wallonie et de la Flandre" (''Letter to the king on the separation of Wallonia and Flanders''), where he wrote: {{quote|Il y a en Belgique des Wallons et des Flamands. Il n'y a pas de Belges.&lt;br&gt;''In Belgium there are [[Walloons]] and [[Flemish people|Fleming]]s. There are no [[Belgian]]s.''}} Contrary to later interpretations Destrée didn't favor separatism, but wanted a move to a [[federal state]]. King [[Albert I of Belgium]] wrote an official answer to the letter, which read:  ''I read the letter of Destrée, which, without uncertainty, is some literature of great talent. All that he said is absolutely true, but it is not less true that administrative separation would be an evil with more disadvantages and dangers than any aspect of the current situation.''&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} J'ai lu la lettre de Destrée qui, sans conteste, est un littérateur de grand talent. Tout ce qu'il dit est absolument vrai, mais il est non moins vrai que la séparation administrative serait un mal entraînant plus d'inconvénients et de dangers de tout genre que la situation actuelle. Landro, 30 août, ''A Jules Ingebleek, secrétaire  privé du Roi et de la Reine'', lettre reproduite in extenso in M-R Thielemans et E. Vandewoude, ''Le Roi Albert au travers de ses lettres inédites'', Office international de librairie, Bruxelles, 1982, pp. 435-436.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1960 Flemish politician [[Gaston Eyskens]] modified this quote, saying "Sire, il n'y a plus de Belges" (''Sire, there are no more Belgians''), after the first steps were taken to transform Belgium into a [[federal state]].

==Etymology==

The [[neologism]] "belgitude" was coined in 1976, by [[Pierre Mertens]] and Claude Jevaeu in as issue of the ''Nouvelles littéraires'' called "L'autre Belgique".&lt;ref name=bainbrigge /&gt; It alludes to the term ''[[négritude]]'' about feeling black, expressed by [[Leopold Sedar Senghor]]. The term caught on quick enough to be referred to in Belgian singer [[Jacques Brel]]'s song "Mai 1940" ("May 1940"), which was left off his final album ''[[Les Marquises]]'' in 1977, but made available in 2003. In the song Brel refers to German soldiers who occupied Belgium during [[World War Two]] and wiped out his belgitude:

''D'un ciel plus bleu qua'à l'habitude'',            ''(Translation: "From a heaven bluer than usual")''
 
''Ce mai 40 a salué''                                ''(Translation: "That May 1940 greeted")''
 
''Quelques Allemands disciplinés''                   ''(Translation: "Several disciplined Germans")''
 
''Qui écrasaient ma belgitude,''                   ''(Translation: "Who wiped out my belgitude".)'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_ons003200301_01/_ons003200301_01_0174.php|title=Ons Erfdeel. Jaargang 46 · dbnl|first=|last=DBNL|website=DBNL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the word "Belgitude" was listed in the French encyclopedia, the [[Petit Larousse]]'' &lt;ref&gt;« « Belgitude » dans le Petit Larousse illustré » dans [http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1502/Belgique/article/detail/1284233/2011/06/27/Belgitude-dans-le-Petit-Larousse-illustre.dhtml 7sur7.be], 27 juin 2011, consulté le 28 juin 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of belgitudes==

Belgitude is characterised by things that are unique to Belgian culture, such as [[Belgian Dutch]] and [[Belgian French]]. The Dutch in Belgium has many [[gallicism]]s and the French in Belgium many [[hollandism]]s, both in terms of words as well as grammar. The word "bourgemestre" ([[mayor]]) in Wallonia, for instance, is clearly inspired by the Dutch word "burgemeester" and differs considerably from the commonly accepted French word "maire". The word "plezant" ("amusing") in [[Flanders]] is a derivation of the French word "plaisant" and is hardly used in [[The Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlaamsetaal.be/artikel/171/franse-invloed|title=VlaamseTaal.be - Franse invloed|website=www.vlaamsetaal.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical foods and drinks, such as [[Belgian beer]], [[moules frites]], [[speculaas]], [[waterzooi]], [[witloof]], [[Brussels sprouts]], [[Belgian chocolate]],... are also seen as examples of belgitude, because they are often promoted abroad. People who were important to Belgian history are also often cited: [[Ambiorix]], [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], [[Charles V of Spain]], [[Adolphe Sax]], [[Baudouin of Belgium]], as are cultural icons such as [[Manneken Pis]], the [[Carnival of Binche|Gilles of Binche]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]], [[Inspector Maigret]], the [[Atomium]], [[Jacques Brel]], [[René Magritte]], [[Soeur Sourire]], [[Django Reinhardt]],... In the fields of sport [[Eddy Merckx]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Red Devils]] are a good example. The song ''"[[Potverdekke! (It's great to be a Belgian)]]" (1998)'' by [[John Makin|Mr. John]] is also an expression of belgitude. The satirical comedy and film adaptation ''[[Sois Belge et tais-toi]]'', the films of [[Jan Bucquoy]] and the comedy team [[Les Snuls]] are all loving and mocking tributes to the Belgian identity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5174">In popular culture, the '''Bro Code''' is a friendship [[etiquette]] to be followed among men or, more specifically, among members of the [[Bro (subculture)|bro subculture]]. The term has been popularized by [[Barney Stinson]], a character from the television show ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]''. Katherine Connor Martin, head of content creation at [[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]], recognized Stinson as "the quintessence of a certain iteration of the contemporary bro".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2013/10/the-rise-of-the-portmanbro/ |title=The rise of the portmanbro |last1=Martin |first1=Katherine Connor |date=October 9, 2013 |publisher=[[Oxford Dictionaries]] |accessdate=April 5, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Oc7U2FBb?url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2013/10/the-rise-of-the-portmanbro/ |archivedate=April 5, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==The notion==

=== Early references ===
The notion of an unwritten set of rules that govern the relationship between male friends is present in popular culture at least since 1991. In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Stranded]]", which aired on November 27 that year, Jerry Seinfeld says the following monologue, in one of his stand-up bits:

{{Quote|text=All plans between men are tentative.  If one man should suddenly have an opportunity to pursue a woman, it's like these two guys never met each other ever in life.  '''This is the male code'''.  And it doesn't matter how important the arrangements are [...]|source="The Stranded"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheStranded.html|title=The Stranded|publisher=SeinfeldScripts|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;|character=Jerry Seinfeld|title=''Seinfeld''}}

=== "Bros before hoes" ===
"[[wikt:bros before hoes|Bros before hoes]]" (that is, "friends before women") is a well-known, vulgar slang expression about how men should not abandon their male friends in order to pursue or embark on relationships with women.

The "bros before hoes" expression is often regarded as the "golden rule" of male friendship, and it has been common slang at least since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/bros-before-hoes|title=What does bros before hoes mean? bros before hoes Definition. Meaning of bros before hoes. |publisher=OnlineSlangDictionary.com |access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used by ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' character [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] in "[[A Benihana Christmas]]", and was later popularized by Barney Stinson.

{{wiktionary|chip on one's shoulder}}
To have a '''chip on one's shoulder''' refers to the act of holding a [[wikt:grudge|grudge]] or [[grievance]] that readily provokes disputation.

It can also mean a person thinking too much of oneself (often without the [[credentials]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Korach|first1=Myron|title=Common Phrases: And Where They Come From|date=1 September 2002|publisher=The Lyon Press|location=New York|isbn=1585746827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Don't try to knock a chip from Riley's shoulder (NYPL Hades-464072-1165846).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover of sheet music for the song titled: "''Don't Try to Knock a Chip from Riley's Shoulder.''" (J. W. Wheeler) which alludes to the expression,]]
"A chip on the shoulder" comes from the ancient right of [[shipwrights]] within the [[Royal Navy Dockyard]]s to take home a daily allowance of offcuts of [[timber]], even if good wood was cut up for this purpose. The privilege was instated as a prescriptive right from 1634.&lt;ref name = linebaugh-2003/&gt;&lt;ref name = lunn&amp;day-1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, H.E., 'Wages of Shipwrights in H.M. Dockyards, 1496-1788', Mariner's Mirror, Vol. 33 (1947), p.266.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1756, this privilege had been abused and was costing taxpayers too much in lost timber for warship repair and construction. The decision was then made by the [[Navy Board]] to limit the quantity a shipwright could carry home. A warrant was issued to the Royal Dockyards to reduce the quantity of chips by ordering shipwrights to carry their bundles under their arms instead of on their shoulders, as one could not carry as much timber in this fashion. The specific incident from which the expression derives is as follows:

{{cquote|Master Shipwright and his Assistant, [[Chatham Dockyard]], to Navy Board, 17 June 1756.

On Tuesday a petition was brought to the Honourable Thomas Cooper, Esq., Commissioner of this yard, by John Bissenden and Robert Woodriff, shipwrights, in behalf of the whole body of shipwrights, relating to their carrying chips out of the yard on their shoulders. The next day the Commissioner sent for them in the presence of the Master Shipwright and the First Assistant and represented to them the ill consequence of such proceedings, and read to them your Honourable Board's warrant of the 4 May 1753 on which the said two men withdrew the petition and said they would talk to all the people and believe everybody would be satisfied with what had been said to them. And in the afternoon the Master Shipwright sent for all the foremen and quartermen and read the Order to them of the 4th May 1753, and give every quarterman a particular charge to tell all his men separately what the order was relating to their lowering their chips and carrying them under their arm out of the yard.

This day at twelve of the clock some few of the workmen about one hundred and fifty came up first to the gate without any chips, afterwards about twenty more came and lowered their chips agreeable to the Board's warrant. Then came John Miller, shipwright, about thirty feet before the main body of the people, on which the Master Shipwright ordered him to lower his chips. He answered he would not, with that the Master Shipwright took hold of him, and said he should. He, the said Miller replied, 'Are not the chips mine? I will not lower them.' Immediately the main body pushed on with their chips on their shoulders, crowded and forced the Master Shipwright and the First Assistant through the gateway, and when out of the yard give three huzzas.&lt;ref&gt;National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London, ADM/B/153: Admiralty In-Letters, transcribed in Hattendorf, J.B. et al., ''British Naval Documents'' (London, Naval Records Society, 1993), pp. 528-529&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:They knocked the chip off Uncle Sam's shoulder^ So let's go productioneer... Let's show `em some chips^ - NARA - 534974.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An American wartime poster alluding to the expression.]]
This custom{{clarify|date=March 2017}} is known in North America since the early 19th century. The [[New York City|New York]] newspaper ''Long Island Telegraph'' reported on 20 May 1830 "when two churlish boys were determined to fight, a chip would be placed on the shoulder of one, and the other demanded to knock it off at his peril". A similar notion is mentioned in the issue of the ''Onondaga Standard'' of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on 8 December 1830: "'He waylay me', said I, 'the mean sneaking fellow—I am only afraid that he will sue me for damages. Oh! if I only could get him to knock a chip off my shoulder, and so get round the law, I would give him one of the soundest thrashings he ever had'." Some time later in 1855, the phrase "chip on his shoulder" appeared in the ''Weekly Oregonian'', stating "Leland, in his last issue, struts out with a chip on his shoulder, and dares Bush to knock it off". In American author [[Mark Twain]]'s 1898 manuscript of ''[[Schoolhouse Hill]]'', character [[Tom Sawyer]] states his knowledge of the phrase and custom when he says, "[I]f you want your fuss, and can't wait till recess, which is regular, go at it right and fair; put a chip on your shoulder and dare him to knock it off."&lt;ref&gt;William M. Gibson, ed., Mark Twain's Mysterious Stranger Manuscripts (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1969), p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the custom is well described at St. Peter Claver's Indian Residential School for [[Ojibway]] boys in the town of [[Spanish, Ontario]]:

{{cquote|By custom, the challenger, usually one of the intermediates, anxious to prove his worth or avenge some wrong, would deliberately seek out his foe with a wood chip or flat stone on his shoulder, placed there either by his own hand or by that of somebody else.}}
The challenger might further provoke his opponent by issuing a [[:wikt:dare|dare]] for him to knock off the chip. The opponent might then display his bravery and contempt by brushing the cheek of the challenger lightly as he did so. In more formal cases, a [[duel|second]] might take the chip and present the chip to his man who would then place it on his own shoulder. The boys would then square off and [[fistfight]] like boxers.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=Basil H.|authorlink1=Basil H.

==In Popular Culture==

A '''choice function''' ('''selector''', '''selection''')  is a [[mathematical function]] ''f''  that is defined on some collection ''X'' of nonempty [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and assigns to each set ''S'' in that collection some element ''f''(''S'') of ''S''.  In other words, ''f'' is a choice function for ''X'' if and only if it belongs to the [[direct product]] of ''X''.

== An example ==
Let ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{&amp;nbsp;{1,4,7},&amp;nbsp;{9},&amp;nbsp;{2,7}&amp;nbsp;}. Then the function that assigns 7 to the set {1,4,7}, 9 to {9}, and 2 to {2,7} is a choice function on ''X''.

== History and importance ==
[[Ernst Zermelo]] (1904) introduced choice functions as well as the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) and proved the [[well-ordering theorem]],&lt;ref name="Zermelo, 1904"&gt;{{cite journal| first=Ernst| last=Zermelo| year=1904| title=Beweis, dass jede Menge wohlgeordnet werden kann| journal=Mathematische Annalen| volume=59| issue=4| pages=514–16| doi=10.1007/BF01445300| url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/no_cache/en/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=28526}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that every set can be [[well ordering|well-ordered]]. AC states that every set of nonempty sets has a choice function. A weaker form of AC, the [[axiom of countable choice]] (AC&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;) states that every [[countable set]] of nonempty sets has a choice function. However, in the absence of either AC or AC&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;, some sets can still be shown to have a choice function.

*If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[finite set|finite]] set of nonempty sets, then one can construct a choice function for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by picking one element from each member of &lt;math&gt;X.&lt;/math&gt; This requires only finitely many choices, so neither AC or AC&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; is needed.
*If every member of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a nonempty set, and the [[union (set theory)|union]] &lt;math&gt;\bigcup X&lt;/math&gt; is well-ordered, then one may choose the least element of each member of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, it was possible to simultaneously well-order every member of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by making just one choice of a well-order of the union, so neither AC nor AC&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; was needed. (This example shows that the well-ordering theorem implies AC. The [[Converse (logic)|converse]] is also true, but less trivial.)

== Refinement of the notion of choice function ==
A function &lt;math&gt;f: A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a selection of a [[multivalued function|multivalued map]] φ:''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B''  (that is, a function &lt;math&gt;\varphi:A\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(B)&lt;/math&gt; from ''A'' to the [[power set]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(B)&lt;/math&gt;), if
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a \in A \, ( f(a) \in \varphi(a) ) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The existence of more regular choice functions, namely continuous or measurable selections is important in the theory of [[differential inclusion]]s, [[optimal control]], and [[mathematical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bourbaki tau function===
[[Nicolas Bourbaki]] used [[epsilon calculus]] for their foundations that had a &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; symbol that could be interpreted as choosing an object (if one existed) that satisfies a given proposition. So if &lt;math&gt; P(x) &lt;/math&gt; is a predicate, then &lt;math&gt;\tau_{x}(P)&lt;/math&gt; is the object that satisfies &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; (if one exists, otherwise it returns an arbitrary object). Hence we may obtain quantifiers from the choice function, for example &lt;math&gt; P( \tau_{x}(P))&lt;/math&gt; was equivalent to &lt;math&gt; (\exists x)(P(x))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourbaki|first=Nicolas|title=Elements of Mathematics: Theory of Sets|isbn=0-201-00634-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bourbaki's choice operator is stronger than usual: it's a ''global'' choice operator. That is, it implies the [[axiom of global choice]].&lt;ref&gt;John Harrison, "The Bourbaki View" [http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/logic/jrh0105.htm eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; Hilbert realized this when introducing epsilon calculus.&lt;ref&gt;"Here, moreover, we come upon a very remarkable circumstance, namely, that all of these transfinite axioms are derivable from a single axiom, one that also contains the core of one of the most attacked axioms in the literature of mathematics, namely, the axiom of choice: &lt;math&gt;A(a)\to A(\varepsilon(A))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the transfinite logical choice function." Hilbert (1925), “On the Infinite”, excerpted in Jean van Heijenoort, ''From Frege to Gödel'', p. 382. From [http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/choice+operator nCatLab].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Classical control theory''' is a branch of [[control theory]] that deals with the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s with inputs, and how their behavior is modified by [[feedback]], using the [[Laplace transform]] as a basic tool to model such systems.

The usual objective of control theory is to control a system, often called the ''[[Plant (control theory)|plant]]'', so its output follows a desired control signal, called the ''[[reference]]'', which may be a fixed or changing value.  To do this a ''[[Controller (control theory)|controller]]'' is designed, which monitors the output and compares it with the reference.  The difference between actual and desired output, called the ''error'' signal, is applied as [[feedback]] to the input of the system, to bring the actual output closer to the reference.

Classical control theory deals with [[linear time-invariant system|linear time-invariant]] [[single-input single-output]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhong|first1=Wan-Xie|title=Duality System in Applied Mechanics and Optimal Control|date=2004|publisher=Kluwer|isbn=978-1-4020-7880-4|page=283|quote=The classical controller design methodology is iterative, and is effective for single-input, single-output linear time-invariant system analysis and design.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Laplace transform of the input and output signal of such systems can be calculated. The [[transfer function]] relates the Laplace transform of the input and the output.

==Feedback==

To overcome the limitations of the [[open-loop controller]], classical control theory introduces [[feedback]]. A [[closed-loop controller]] uses feedback to control [[state (controls)|states]] or [[Negative feedback#Overview|output]]s of a [[dynamical system]]. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., [[voltage]] applied to an [[electric motor]]) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with [[sensor]]s and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is "fed back" as input to the process, closing the loop.

Closed-loop controllers have the following advantages over [[open-loop controller]]s:
* disturbance rejection (such as hills in the cruise control example above)
* guaranteed performance even with [[mathematical model|model]] uncertainties, when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact
* [[instability|unstable]] processes can be stabilized
* reduced sensitivity to parameter variations
* improved reference tracking performance

In some systems, closed-loop and open-loop control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed [[feed forward (control)|feedforward]] and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.

A common closed-loop controller architecture is the [[PID controller]].

==Classical vs modern==

A Physical system can be modeled in the "time domain", where the response of a given system is a function of the various inputs, the previous system values, and time. As time progresses, the state of the system and its response change. However, time-domain models for systems are frequently modeled using high-order differential equations which can become impossibly difficult for humans to solve and some of which can even become impossible for modern computer systems to solve efficiently.

To counteract this problem, classical control theory uses the [[Laplace transform]] to change an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the time domain into a regular algebraic polynomial in the transform domain. Once a given system has been converted into the transform domain it can be manipulated with greater ease.

[[Modern control theory]], instead of changing domains to avoid the complexities of time-domain ODE mathematics, converts the differential equations into a system of lower-order time domain equations called [[state space (control)|state equations]], which can then be manipulated using techniques from linear algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ogata|first1=Katsuhiko|title=Modern Control Systems|date=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-615673-4|page=2|edition=Fifth|quote=modern control theory, based on time-domain analysis and synthesis using state variables}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laplace transform==
{{main|Laplace transform}}

Classical control theory uses the Laplace transform to model the systems and signals. The Laplace transform is a frequency-domain approach for continuous time signals irrespective of whether the system is stable or unstable. The Laplace transform of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''(''t'')}}, defined for all [[real number]]s {{math|''t'' ≥ 0}}, is the function {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a unilateral transform defined by
: &lt;math&gt;F(s) =\int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s'' is a [[complex number]] frequency parameter
: &lt;math&gt;s = \sigma + i \omega&lt;/math&gt;, with real numbers {{math|''σ''}} and {{math|''ω''}}.

==Closed-loop transfer function==
{{details|closed-loop transfer function}}
The output of the system ''y(t)'' is fed back through a sensor measurement ''F'' to the reference value ''r(t)''. The controller ''C'' then takes the error ''e'' (difference) between the reference and the output to change the inputs ''u'' to the system under control ''P''. This is shown in the figure. This kind of controller is a closed-loop controller or feedback controller.

This is called a single-input-single-output (''SISO'') control system; ''MIMO'' (i.e., Multi-Input-Multi-Output) systems, with more than one input/output, are common. In such cases variables are represented through [[coordinate vector|vectors]] instead of simple [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values. For some [[distributed parameter systems]] the vectors may be infinite-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] (typically functions).

[[File:simple feedback control loop2.svg|center|A simple feedback control loop]]

If we assume the controller ''C'', the plant ''P'', and the sensor ''F'' are [[linear]] and [[time-invariant]] (i.e., elements of their [[transfer function]] ''C(s)'', ''P(s)'', and ''F(s)'' do not depend on time), the systems above can be analysed using the [[Laplace transform]] on the variables. This gives the following relations:

: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = P(s) U(s)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;U(s) = C(s) E(s)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;E(s) = R(s) - F(s)Y(s).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''Y''(''s'') in terms of ''R''(''s'') gives

: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = \left( \frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)} \right) R(s) = H(s)R(s).&lt;/math&gt;

The expression &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)}&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the ''closed-loop transfer function'' of the system. The numerator is the forward (open-loop) gain from ''r'' to ''y'', and the denominator is one plus the gain in going around the feedback loop, the so-called loop gain. If &lt;math&gt;|P(s)C(s)| \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., it has a large [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] with each value of ''s'', and if &lt;math&gt;|F(s)| \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;, then ''Y(s)'' is approximately equal to ''R(s)'' and the output closely tracks the reference input.

==PID controller==
{{details|PID controller}}
The [[PID controller]] is probably the most-used feedback control design. ''PID'' is an initialism for ''Proportional-Integral-Derivative'', referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal. If ''u(t)'' is the control signal sent to the system, ''y(t)'' is the measured output and ''r(t)'' is the desired output, and tracking error &lt;math&gt;e(t)=r(t)- y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, a PID controller has the general form

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) =  K_P e(t) + K_I \int e(t)\text{d}t + K_D \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}e(t).&lt;/math&gt;

The desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters &lt;math&gt; K_P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; K_I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; K_D&lt;/math&gt;, often iteratively by "tuning" and without specific knowledge of a plant model. Stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term. The integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance (often a striking specification in [[process control]]). The derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response. PID controllers are the most well established class of control systems: however, they cannot be used in several more complicated cases, especially if multiple-input multiple-output systems (MIMO) systems are considered.

Applying Laplace transformation results in the transformed PID controller equation

:&lt;math&gt;u(s) =  K_P e(s) + K_I \frac{1}{s} e(s) + K_D s e(s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u(s) =  \left(K_P + K_I \frac{1}{s} + K_D s\right) e(s)&lt;/math&gt;

with the PID controller transfer function
:&lt;math&gt;C(s) = \left(K_P + K_I \frac{1}{s} + K_D s\right).&lt;/math&gt;
There exists a nice example of the closed-loop system discussed above. If we take

PID controller transfer function in series form

:&lt;math&gt;C(s) =  K \left(1 + \frac{1}{sT_i}\right)(1 + sT_d)&lt;/math&gt;

1st order filter in feedback loop

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \frac{1}{1 + sT_f}&lt;/math&gt;

linear actuator with filtered input

:&lt;math&gt;P(s) = \frac{A}{1 + sT_p}&lt;/math&gt;,   A = const

and insert all this into expression for closed-loop transfer function H(s), then tuning is very easy: simply put

:&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{A},   T_i = T_f,   T_d = T_p&lt;/math&gt;

and get H(s) = 1 identically.

For practical PID controllers, a pure differentiator is neither physically realisable nor desirable&lt;ref&gt;Ang, K.H., Chong, G.C.Y., and Li, Y. (2005). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1453566 PID control system analysis, design, and technology, ''IEEE Trans Control Systems Tech'', 13(4), pp.559-576].&lt;/ref&gt; due to amplification of noise and resonant modes in the system. Therefore, a phase-lead compensator type approach is used instead, or a differentiator with low-pass roll-off.

==Tools==

Classical control theory uses an array of tools to analyze systems and design controllers for such systems. Tools include the [[root locus]], the [[Nyquist stability criterion]], the [[Bode plot]], the [[gain margin]] and [[phase margin]].

'''Cogeneration''' or '''combined heat and power''' ('''CHP''') is the use of a [[heat engine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.com/chp-cogeneration/ Cogeneration and Cogeneration Schematic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209230320/http://www.clarke-energy.com/chp-cogeneration/ |date=2013-12-09 }}, www.clarke-energy.com, retrieved 26.11.11&lt;/ref&gt; or [[power station]] to [[electricity generation|generate electricity]] and [[Heat|useful heat]] at the same time. '''Trigeneration''' or '''combined cooling, heat and power''' ('''CCHP''') refers to the simultaneous generation of electricity and useful heating and cooling from the combustion of a fuel or a solar heat collector. The terms ''cogeneration'' and ''trigeneration'' can be also applied to the power systems generating simultaneously electricity, heat, and industrial chemicals – e.g., [[syngas]] or pure [[hydrogen]] (article: [[combined cycle]]s, chapter: [[Combined cycle#Natural gas integrated power &amp; syngas (hydrogen) generation cycle|natural gas integrated power &amp; syngas (hydrogen) generation cycle]]).

Cogeneration is a more efficient use of fuel because otherwise wasted heat from electricity generation is put to some productive use. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants recover otherwise wasted [[thermal energy]] for [[HVAC#heating|heating]]. This is also called combined heat and power district heating. Small CHP plants are an example of [[Distributed generation|decentralized energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dekb.co.uk/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=82&amp;Itemid=93|title=What is Decentralised Energy?|publisher=The Decentralised Energy Knowledge Base|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210123230/http://www.dekb.co.uk/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=82&amp;Itemid=93|archivedate=2008-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By-product heat at moderate temperatures (100–180&amp;nbsp;°C, 212–356&amp;nbsp;°F) can also be used in [[absorption refrigerator]]s for cooling.

The supply of high-temperature heat first drives a [[gas turbine|gas]] or [[steam turbine]]-powered generator. The resulting low-temperature waste heat is then used for water or space heating. At smaller scales (typically below 1 MW) a [[gas engine]] or [[diesel engine]] may be used. Trigeneration differs from cogeneration in that the [[waste heat]] is used for both heating and cooling, typically in an absorption refrigerator. Combined cooling, heat and power systems can attain higher overall efficiencies than cogeneration or traditional power plants. In the United States, the application of trigeneration in buildings is called building cooling, heating and power. Heating and cooling output may operate concurrently or alternately depending on need and system construction.

Cogeneration was practiced in some of the earliest installations of electrical generation. Before central stations distributed power, industries generating their own power used exhaust steam for process heating. Large office and apartment buildings, hotels and stores commonly generated their own power and used waste steam for building heat. Due to the high cost of early purchased power, these CHP operations continued for many years after utility electricity became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Overview==
[[File:Masnedø power station.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Masnedø]] CHP power station in [[Denmark]]. This station burns straw as fuel. The adjacent greenhouses are heated by [[district heating]] from the plant.]]

Many process industries, such as chemical plants, oil refineries and pulp and paper mills, require large amounts of process heat for such operations as chemical reactors, distillation columns, steam driers and other uses. This heat, which is usually used in the form of steam, can be generated at the typically low pressures used in heating, or can be generated at much higher pressure and passed through a turbine first to generate electricity. In the turbine the steam pressure and temperature is lowered as the internal energy of the steam is converted to work. The lower pressure steam leaving the turbine can then be used for process heat.&lt;!--[[Thermal power plants]] (those that are based on a [[thermodynamic cycle]] to convert heat produced from [[Concentrated solar power|solar mirrors]], [[uranium|fissile elements]], burning [[coal]], [[petroleum]], or [[natural gas]]), and [[heat engine]]s in general, do not convert all of their thermal energy into electricity. In most heat engines, more than half is lost as excess [[heat]] (see: [[Second law of thermodynamics]] and [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]]). By capturing the excess heat, CHP uses heat that would be wasted in a conventional [[power plant]], potentially reaching an [[thermal efficiency|efficiency]] of up to 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/distributedenergy/pdfs/chp_report_12-08.pdf|title=Combined Heat and Power – Effective Energy Solutions for a Sustainable Future|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |accessdate=9 September 2011 |date=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that less fuel needs to be consumed to produce the same amount of useful energy.--&gt;

Steam turbines at [[thermal power station]]s are normally designed to be fed high pressure steam, which exits the turbine at a condenser operating a few degrees above ambient temperature and at a few millimeters of mercury absolute pressure. (This is called a ''condensing'' turbine.) For all practical purposes this steam has negligible useful energy before it is condensed. Steam turbines for cogeneration are designed either for ''extraction'' of some steam at lower pressures after it has passed through a number of turbine stages, with the un-extracted steam going on through the turbine to a condenser. In this case, the extracted steam causes a mechanical [[power loss factor|power loss]] in the downstream stages of the turbine. Or they are designed, with or without extraction, for final exhaust at ''back pressure'' (non-condensing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/36924.pdf|title=Consider Installing High-Pressure Boilers With Back Pressure Turbine-Generators|author=|date=|website=nrel.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221120102/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/36924.pdf|archivedate=21 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steam-its generation and use"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Steam-its generation and use |last= |first= |authorlink= |year= |publisher =Babcock &amp; Wilcox |location= |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extracted or exhaust steam is used for process heating. Steam at ordinary process heating conditions still has a considerable amount of [[enthalpy]] that could be used for power generation, so cogeneration has an opportunity cost.

A typical power generation turbine in a [[paper mill]] may have extraction pressures of 160 psig (1.103 MPa) and 60 psig (0.41 MPa). A typical back pressure may be 60 psig (0.41 MPa). In practice these pressures are custom designed for each facility. Conversely, simply generating process steam for industrial purposes instead of high enough pressure to generate power at the top end also has an opportunity cost (See: [[Steam turbine#Steam supply and exhaust conditions|Steam supply and exhaust conditions]]). The capital and operating cost of high pressure boilers, turbines and generators are substantial. This equipment is normally operated [[Continuous production|continuously]], which usually limits self-generated power to large-scale operations.

[[File:Metz biomass power station.jpg|thumb|left|A cogeneration plant in [[Metz]], [[France]]. The 45MW boiler uses waste wood [[biomass]] as energy source, and provides electricity and heat for 30,000 [[dwelling]]s.]]

A [[combined cycle]] (in which several thermodynamic cycles produce electricity), may also be used to extract heat using a heating system as [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] of the power plant's [[bottoming cycle]]. For example, the RU-25 [[MHD generator]] in [[Moscow]] heated a boiler for a conventional steam powerplant, whose condensate was then used for space heat. A more modern system might use a [[gas turbine]] powered by [[natural gas]], whose exhaust powers a steam plant, whose condensate provides heat. Cogeneration plants based on a combined cycle power unit can have thermal efficiencies above 80%.

The viability of CHP (sometimes termed utilisation factor), especially in smaller CHP installations, depends on a good baseload of operation, both in terms of an on-site (or near site) electrical demand and heat demand. In practice, an exact match between the heat and electricity needs rarely exists. A CHP plant can either meet the need for heat (''heat driven operation'') or be run as a [[power plant]] with some use of its waste heat, the latter being less advantageous in terms of its utilisation factor and thus its overall efficiency. The viability can be greatly increased where opportunities for trigeneration exist. In such cases, the heat from the CHP plant is also used as a primary energy source to deliver cooling by means of an [[absorption chiller]].

CHP is most efficient when heat can be used on-site or very close to it. Overall efficiency is reduced when the heat must be transported over longer distances. This requires heavily insulated pipes, which are expensive and inefficient; whereas electricity can be transmitted along a comparatively simple wire, and over much longer distances for the same energy loss.

A car engine becomes a CHP plant in winter when the reject heat is useful for warming the interior of the vehicle. The example illustrates the point that deployment of CHP depends on heat uses in the vicinity of the heat engine.

Thermally [[enhanced oil recovery]] (TEOR) plants often produce a substantial amount of excess electricity. After generating electricity, these plants pump leftover steam into heavy oil wells so that the oil will flow more easily, increasing production. TEOR cogeneration plants in [[Kern County, California]] produce so much electricity that it cannot all be used locally and is transmitted to [[Los Angeles]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

CHP is one of the most cost-efficient methods of reducing carbon emissions from heating systems in cold climates &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/carbon-footprints-of-various-sources-of-heat-chpdh-comes-out-lowest.html|title=Carbon footprints of various sources of heat – biomass combustion and CHPDH comes out lowest|publisher=Claverton Energy Research Group|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005102349/http://www.claverton-energy.com/carbon-footprints-of-various-sources-of-heat-chpdh-comes-out-lowest.html|archivedate=2011-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is recognized to be the most energy efficient method of transforming energy from fossil fuels or biomass into electric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viessmann.co.uk/en/industry/combined-heat-and-power-generation/chp-units.html|title=Cogeneration recognized to be the most energy efficient method of transforming energy|publisher=Viessmann|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808225555/http://www.viessmann.co.uk/en/industry/combined-heat-and-power-generation/chp-units.html|archivedate=2016-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Cogeneration plants are commonly found in [[district heating]] systems of cities, [[central heating]] systems of larger buildings (e.g. hospitals, hotels, prisons) and are commonly used in the industry in thermal production processes for process water, cooling, steam production or [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] fertilization.

==Types of plants==
Topping cycle plants primarily produce electricity from a steam turbine. Partly expanded steam is then condensed in a heating condensor at a temperature level that is suitable e.g. [[district heating]] or [[water desalination]].

[[Bottoming cycle]] plants produce high temperature heat for industrial processes, then a [[waste heat recovery unit|waste heat recovery]] boiler feeds an electrical plant. Bottoming cycle plants are only used in industrial processes that require very high temperatures such as furnaces for glass and metal manufacturing, so they are less common.

Large cogeneration systems provide heating water and power for an industrial site or an entire town. Common CHP plant types are:
* [[Gas turbine]] CHP plants using the waste heat in the flue gas of gas turbines. The fuel used is typically [[natural gas]].
* [[Gas engine]] CHP plants use a reciprocating gas engine which is generally more competitive than a gas turbine up to about 5 MW. The gaseous fuel used is normally [[natural gas]]. These plants are generally manufactured as fully packaged units that can be installed within a plantroom or external plant compound with simple connections to the site's gas supply, electrical distribution network and heating systems. Typical outputs and efficiences see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/finning-caterpillar-gas-engine-chp-ratings-and-thermal-outputs.html|title=Finning Caterpillar Gas Engine CHP Ratings|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518094951/http://www.claverton-energy.com/finning-caterpillar-gas-engine-chp-ratings-and-thermal-outputs.html|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical large example see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/first-energy-offer-excellent-condition-complete-gas-engined-chp-system-for-sale-and-installation.html|title=Complete 7 MWe Deutz ( 2 x 3.5MWe) gas engine CHP power plant for sale|publisher=Claverton Energy Research Group|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930042456/http://www.claverton-energy.com/first-energy-offer-excellent-condition-complete-gas-engined-chp-system-for-sale-and-installation.html|archivedate=2013-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biofuel|Biofuel engine]] CHP plants use an adapted reciprocating gas engine or [[diesel engine]], depending upon which biofuel is being used, and are otherwise very similar in design to a Gas engine CHP plant. The advantage of using a biofuel is one of reduced [[hydrocarbon fuel]] consumption and thus reduced carbon emissions. These plants are generally manufactured as fully packaged units that can be installed within a plantroom or external plant compound with simple connections to the site's electrical distribution and heating systems. Another variant is the [[wood gasifier]] CHP plant whereby a wood pellet or wood chip biofuel is [[gasified]] in a zero oxygen high temperature environment; the resulting gas is then used to power the gas engine.

Smaller cogeneration units may use a [[reciprocating engine]] or [[Stirling engine]]. The heat is removed from the exhaust and radiator. The systems are popular in small sizes because small gas and diesel engines are less expensive than small gas- or oil-fired steam-electric plants.

Some cogeneration plants are fired by [[biomass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opet-chp.net/download/wp3/iisalmifinland.pdf|title=High cogeneration performance by innovative steam turbine for biomass-fired CHP plant in Iislami, Finland|publisher=OPET|accessdate=13 March 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715113827/http://www.opet-chp.net/download/wp3/iisalmifinland.pdf|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or industrial and [[municipal solid waste]] (see [[incineration]]).

===MicroCHP===
[[Micro combined heat and power]] or 'Micro cogeneration" is a so-called [[Distributed Energy Resource|distributed energy resource]] (DER). The installation is usually less than 5 [[Watt#Electrical and thermal watts|kW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;]] in a house or small business. Instead of burning fuel to merely heat space or water, some of the energy is converted to electricity in addition to heat. This electricity can be used within the home or business or, if permitted by the grid management, sold back into the electric power grid.

Delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64% of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/media/1889744/fct_review_2013.pdf The fuel cell industry review 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414152813/http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/media/1889744/fct_review_2013.pdf |date=2016-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 20.000 units were sold in [[Japan]] in 2012 overall within the Ene Farm project.

MicroCHP installations use five different technologies: [[microturbines]], [[internal combustion]] engines, [[stirling engine]]s, closed cycle [[steam engine]]s and [[fuel cell]]s. One author indicated in 2008 that MicroCHP based on Stirling engines is the most cost effective of the so-called microgeneration technologies in abating carbon emissions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/what-is-microgeneration.html|title=What is Microgeneration?

In the [[United States]], [[Consolidated Edison]] distributes 66 billion kilograms of 350&amp;nbsp;°F (180&amp;nbsp;°C) steam each year through its seven cogeneration plants to 100,000 buildings in [[Manhattan]]—the biggest steam district in the United States.

===Industrial CHP===
Cogeneration is still common in [[pulp and paper mill]]s, refineries and chemical plants. In this "industrial cogeneration/CHP", the heat is typically recovered at higher temperatures (above 100 deg C) and used for process steam or drying duties. This is more valuable and flexible than low-grade waste heat, but there is a slight loss of power generation. The increased focus on [[sustainability]] has made industrial CHP more attractive, as it substantially reduces [[carbon footprint]] compared to generating steam or burning fuel on-site and importing electric power from the grid.

====Utility pressures versus self generated industrial====
Industrial cogeneration plants normally operate at much lower boiler pressures than utilities. Among the reasons are: 1) Cogeneration plants face possible contamination of returned condensate. Because boiler feed water from cogeneration plants has much lower return rates than 100% condensing power plants, industries usually have to treat proportionately more boiler make up water. Boiler feed water must be completely oxygen free and de-mineralized, and the higher the pressure the more critical the level of purity of the feed water.&lt;ref name="Steam-its generation and use"/&gt; 2) Utilities are typically larger scale power than industry, which helps offset the higher capital costs of high pressure. 3) Utilities are less likely to have sharp load swings than industrial operations, which deal with shutting down or starting up units that may represent a significant percent of either steam or power demand.

===Heat recovery steam generators===
A [[heat recovery steam generator]] (HRSG) is a steam boiler that uses hot [[exhaust gas]]es from the [[gas turbine]]s or [[reciprocating engine]]s in a CHP plant to heat up water and generate [[steam]]. The steam, in turn, drives a [[steam turbine]] or is used in industrial processes that require heat.

HRSGs used in the CHP industry are distinguished from conventional steam generators by the following main features:
* The HRSG is designed based upon the specific features of the gas turbine or reciprocating engine that it will be coupled to.
* Since the exhaust gas temperature is relatively low, heat transmission is accomplished mainly through [[convection]].
* The exhaust gas velocity is limited by the need to keep head losses down. Thus, the transmission coefficient is low, which calls for a large heating surface area.
* Since the temperature difference between the hot gases and the fluid to be heated (steam or water) is low, and with the heat transmission coefficient being low as well, the evaporator and economizer are designed with plate fin heat exchangers.

==Comparison with a heat pump==
A [[heat pump]] may be compared with a CHP unit as follows. If, to supply thermal energy, the exhaust steam from the turbo-generator must be taken at a higher temperature than the system would produce most electricity at, the lost electrical generation is ''as if'' a heat pump were used to provide the same heat by taking electrical power from the generator running at lower output temperature and higher efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orchardpartners.co.uk/Docs/IAEEVilniusPaperWhyHeatFromCHPisRenewableMarginalExergyAnalysis2011-09-14.pdf|title=Why Heat From CHP is Renewable - based on paper presented at IAEE Vilnius (2010)|date=2011-09-14|accessdate=2017-12-25|page=4 paragraph 4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921204903/http://www.orchardpartners.co.uk/Docs/IAEEVilniusPaperWhyHeatFromCHPisRenewableMarginalExergyAnalysis2011-09-14.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically for every unit of electrical power lost, then about 6 units of heat are made available at about 90&amp;nbsp;°C. Thus CHP has an effective [[Coefficient of performance|Coefficient of Performance (COP)]] compared to a heat pump of 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2011.05.007| title = Combined heat and power considered as a virtual steam cycle heat pump| year = 2011| last1 = Lowe | first1 = R. | journal = Energy Policy| volume = 39| issue = 9| pages = 5528–5534}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for a remotely operated heat pump, losses in the electrical distribution network would need to be considered, of the order of 6%. Because the losses are proportional to the square of the current, during peak periods losses are much higher than this and it is likely that widespread (i.e. citywide application of heat pumps) would cause overloading of the distribution and transmission grids unless they were substantially reinforced.

It is also possible to run a heat driven operation combined with a heat pump, where the excess electricity (as heat demand is the defining factor on utilization) is used to drive a heat pump. As heat demand increases, more electricity is generated to drive the heat pump, with the waste heat also heating the heating fluid.

==Distributed generation==
Most industrial countries generate the majority of their electrical power needs in large centralized facilities with capacity for large electrical power output. These plants benefit from economy of scale, but may need to transmit electricity across long distances causing transmission losses. Cogeneration or trigeneration production is subject to limitations in the local demand, and thus may sometimes need to reduce e.g. heat or cooling production to match the demand. An example of cogeneration with trigeneration applications in a major city is the [[New York City steam system]].

==Thermal efficiency==
Every heat engine is subject to the theoretical efficiency limits of the [[Carnot cycle]] or subset [[Rankine cycle]] in the case of steam turbine power plants or [[Brayton cycle]] in gas turbine with steam turbine plants. Most of the efficiency loss with steam power generation is associated with the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]] of steam that is not recovered when a turbine exhausts its low temperature and pressure steam to a condenser. (Typical steam to condenser would be at a few millimeters absolute pressure and on the order of 5&amp;nbsp;°C/11&amp;nbsp;°F hotter than the cooling water temperature, depending on the condenser capacity.) In cogeneration this steam exits the turbine at a higher temperature where it may be used for process heat, building heat or cooling with an [[absorption chiller]]. The majority of this heat is from the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]] when the steam condenses.

[[Thermal efficiency]] in a cogeneration system is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{th} \equiv \frac{W_{out}}{Q_{in}} \equiv \frac{\text{Electrical power output + Heat output}}{\text{Total heat input}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{th}&lt;/math&gt; = Thermal efficiency
:&lt;math&gt;W_{out}&lt;/math&gt; = Total work output by all systems
:&lt;math&gt;Q_{in}&lt;/math&gt; = Total heat input into the system

Heat output may be used also for cooling (for example in Summer), thanks to an absorption chiller.
If cooling is achieved in the same time, [[Thermal efficiency]] in a trigeneration system is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{th} \equiv \frac{W_{out}}{Q_{in}} \equiv \frac{\text{Electrical power output + Heat output + Cooling output}}{\text{Total heat input}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{th}&lt;/math&gt; = Thermal efficiency
:&lt;math&gt;W_{out}&lt;/math&gt; = Total work output by all systems
:&lt;math&gt;Q_{in}&lt;/math&gt; = Total heat input into the system

Typical cogeneration models have losses as in any system. The energy distribution below is represented as a percent of total input energy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trigeneration Systems with Fuel Cells|url=http://www.icrepq.com/icrepq-08/245-san-martin.pdf|work=Research Paper|accessdate=18 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006064857/http://www.icrepq.com/icrepq-08/245-san-martin.pdf|archivedate=6 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Electricity = 45%
:Heat + Cooling = 40%
:Heat losses = 13%
:Electrical line losses = 2%

Conventional central coal- or nuclear-powered power stations convert about 33-45% of their input heat to electricity.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |title=DOE – Fossil Energy: How Turbine Power Plants Work |publisher=Fossil.energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095840/http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |archivedate=May 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steam-its generation and use"/&gt;  [[Brayton cycle]] power plants operate at up to 60% efficiency. In the case of conventional power plants approximately 10-15% of this heat is lost up the stack of the boiler, most of the remaining heat emerges from the turbines as low-grade waste heat with no significant local uses so it is usually rejected to the environment, typically to cooling water passing through a condenser.&lt;ref name="Steam-its generation and use"/&gt; Because turbine exhaust is normally just above ambient temperature, some potential power generation is sacrificed in rejecting higher temperature steam from the turbine for cogeneration purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See Mechanical or Chemical Engineering texts on Thermodynamics.&lt;/ref&gt;

For cogeneration to be practical power generation and end use of heat must be in relatively close proximity (&lt;2 KM typically).
Even though the efficiency of a small distributed electrical generator may be lower than a large central power plant, the use of its waste heat for local heating and cooling can result in an overall use of the primary fuel supply as great as 80%.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"/&gt; This provides substantial financial and environmental benefits.

==Costs==
{{See also|Cost of electricity by source}}
Typically, for a gas-fired plant the fully installed cost per kW electrical is around £400/kW ($577 USD), which is comparable with large central power stations.&lt;ref name="claverton-energy.com"/&gt;

===Cogeneration in Europe===
[[File:Power plant at sunset.jpg|thumb|220px|A cogeneration thermal power plant in [[Ferrera Erbognone]] ([[Province of Pavia|PV]]), [[Italy]]]]

The [[European Union|EU]] has actively incorporated cogeneration into its energy policy via the [[CHP Directive]]. In September 2008 at a hearing of the European Parliament’s Urban Lodgment Intergroup, Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs is quoted as saying, “security of supply really starts with energy efficiency.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.cogeneurope.eu/Downloadables/Publications/230908_Energy_Efficiency_Industrial_Forum_Security_of_Supply.pdf |title =Energy Efficiency Industrial Forum Position Paper: energy efficiency – a vital component of energy security }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy efficiency and cogeneration are recognized in the opening paragraphs of the European Union’s Cogeneration Directive 2004/08/EC. This directive intends to support cogeneration and establish a method for calculating cogeneration abilities per country. The development of cogeneration has been very uneven over the years and has been dominated throughout the last decades by national circumstances.

The European Union generates 11% of its electricity using cogeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogeneurope.eu/medialibrary/2011/04/21/2bc24419/240311%20COGEN%20Europe%20press%20release.pdf|title=2011 - Cogen -Experts discuss the central role cogeneration has to play in shaping EU energy policy|author=|date=|website=cogeneurope.eu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620044706/http://www.cogeneurope.eu/medialibrary/2011/04/21/2bc24419/240311%20COGEN%20Europe%20press%20release.pdf|archivedate=20 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is large difference between Member States with variations of the energy savings between 2% and 60%. Europe has the three countries with the world’s most intensive cogeneration economies: Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cogeneurope.eu/Downloadables/Publications/Cogeneration_Europe_Draft_paper_on_Security_of_Supply_in_EU_energy_policy.pdf |title=COGEN Europe: Cogeneration in the European Union’s Energy Supply Security }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 28.46 TWh of electrical power generated by conventional thermal power plants in Finland in 2012, 81.80% was cogeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energia.fi/tilastot-ja-julkaisut/sahkotilastot/sahkontuotanto/sahkon-hankinta-energialahteittain |title=Electricity Generation by Energy Source |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220125742/http://energia.fi/tilastot-ja-julkaisut/sahkotilastot/sahkontuotanto/sahkon-hankinta-energialahteittain |archivedate=2014-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other European countries are also making great efforts to increase efficiency. Germany reported that at present, over 50% of the country’s total electricity demand could be provided through cogeneration. So far, Germany has set the target to double its electricity cogeneration from 12.5% of the country’s electricity to 25% of the country’s electricity by 2020 and has passed supporting legislation accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KWKG 2002|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kwkg_2002/__1.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095900/http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kwkg_2002/__1.html|archivedate=2014-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK is also actively supporting combined heat and power. In light of UK’s goal to achieve a 60% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, the government has set the target to source at least 15% of its government electricity use from CHP by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/energy/chp/index.htm |title=DEFRA Action in the UK - Combined Heat and Power |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612100647/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/energy/chp/index.htm |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other UK measures to encourage CHP growth are financial incentives, grant support, a greater regulatory framework, and government leadership and partnership.

According to the IEA 2008 modeling of cogeneration expansion for the G8 countries, the expansion of cogeneration in France, Germany, Italy and the UK alone would effectively double the existing primary fuel savings by 2030. This would increase Europe’s savings from today’s 155.69 Twh to 465 Twh in 2030. It would also result in a 16% to 29% increase in each country’s total cogenerated electricity by 2030.

Governments are being assisted in their CHP endeavors by organizations like [[COGEN Europe]] who serve as an information hub for the most recent updates within Europe’s energy policy. COGEN is Europe’s umbrella organization representing the interests of the cogeneration industry.

===Cogeneration in the United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the ''Combined Heat and Power Quality Assurance'' scheme regulates the combined production of heat and power. It was introduced in 1996. It defines, through calculation of inputs and outputs, "Good Quality CHP" in terms of the achievement of primary energy savings against conventional separate generation of heat and electricity. Compliance with Combined Heat and Power Quality Assurance is required for cogeneration installations to be eligible for government subsidies and tax incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chpqa.decc.gov.uk|title=Combined Heat and Power Quality Assurance Programme|author=|date=|website=decc.gov.uk|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030232902/http://chpqa.decc.gov.uk/|archivedate=30 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cogeneration in the United States===
[[File:Mirant Kendall Cogeneration Station.jpg|thumb|right|The 250 [[megawatt|MW]] [[Kendall Cogeneration Station]] plant in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]]]

Perhaps the first modern use of [[energy recycling]] was done by [[Thomas Edison]]. His 1882 [[Pearl Street Station]], the world’s first commercial power plant, was a combined heat and power plant, producing both electricity and thermal energy while using waste heat to warm neighboring buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogeneration.net/ThomasEdisonsCogenPlant.htm|title=World’s First Commercial Power Plant Was a Cogeneration Plant|work=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080425015724/http://www.cogeneration.net/ThomasEdisonsCogenPlant.htm|archivedate=2008-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling allowed Edison’s plant to achieve approximately 50 percent efficiency.

By the early 1900s, regulations emerged to promote rural electrification through the construction of centralized plants managed by regional utilities. These regulations not only promoted electrification throughout the countryside, but they also discouraged decentralized power generation, such as cogeneration.

By 1978, Congress recognized that efficiency at central power plants had stagnated and sought to encourage improved efficiency with the [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act]] (PURPA), which encouraged utilities to buy power from other energy producers.

Cogeneration plants proliferated, soon producing about 8% of all energy in the United States.&lt;ref name=localpower&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localpower.org/documents/report_worldsurvey06.pdf|title=World Survey of Decentralized Energy|date=May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bill left implementation and enforcement up to individual states, resulting in little or nothing being done in many parts of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

20% of generation capacity by the year 2030.

{{Complex systems}}
A '''complex system''' is a [[system]] composed of many components which may interact with each other. Examples of complex systems are Earth's global [[climate]], [[organisms]], the [[human brain]], infrastructure such as power grid, transportation or communication systems, social and economic organizations (like [[cities]]), an [[ecosystem]], a living [[Cell (biology)|cell]], and ultimately the entire [[universe]].

Complex systems are [[system]]s whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. Systems that are "[[Complexity|complex]]" have distinct properties that arise from these relationships, such as [[Nonlinear system|nonlinearity]], [[emergence]], [[spontaneous order]], [[Complex adaptive system|adaptation]], and [[Feedback|feedback loops]], among others. Because such systems appear in a wide variety of fields, the commonalities among them have become the topic of their own independent area of research. In many cases it is useful to represent such a system as a network where the nodes represent the components and the links their interactions.

== Overview ==
The term ''complex systems'' often refers to the study of complex systems, which is an approach to science that investigates how relationships between a system's parts give rise to its collective behaviors and how the system interacts and forms relationships with its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bar-Yam|first=Yaneer|date=2002|title=General Features of Complex Systems|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c15/E1-29-01-00.pdf|journal=Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems|EOLSS]] [[UNESCO]] Publishers, Oxford, UK|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of complex systems regards collective, or system-wide, behaviors as the fundamental object of study; for this reason, complex systems can be understood as an alternative paradigm to [[reductionism]], which attempts to explain systems in terms of their constituent parts and the individual interactions between them.

As an interdisciplinary domain, complex systems draws contributions from many different fields, such as the study of [[self-organization]] from physics, that of [[spontaneous order]] from the social sciences, [[Chaos theory|chaos]] from mathematics, [[Complex adaptive system|adaptation]] from biology, and many others. ''Complex systems'' is therefore often used as a broad term encompassing a research approach to problems in many diverse disciplines, including [[statistical physics]], [[information theory]], [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear dynamics]], [[anthropology]], [[computer science]], [[meteorology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]], and [[biology]].

== Key concepts ==

=== Systems ===
[[File:OpenSystemRepresentation.svg|thumb|252px|''Open systems'' have input and output flows, representing exchanges of matter, energy or information with their surroundings.]]
Complex systems is chiefly concerned with the behaviors and properties of ''[[system]]s''. A system, broadly defined, is a set of entities that, through their interactions, relationships, or dependencies, form a unified whole. It is always defined in terms of its ''boundary'', which determines the entities that are or are not part of the system. Entities lying outside the system then become part of the system's ''environment''.

A system can exhibit ''properties'' that produce ''behaviors'' which are distinct from the properties and behaviors of its parts; these system-wide or ''global'' properties and behaviors are characteristics of how the system interacts with or appears to its environment, or of how its parts behave (say, in response to external stimuli) by virtue of being within the system. The notion of ''behavior'' implies that the study of systems is also concerned with processes that take place over time (or, in [[mathematics]], some other [[phase space]] [[Parametrization|parameterization]]). Because of their broad, interdisciplinary applicability, systems concepts play a central role in complex systems.

As a field of study, complex systems is a subset of [[systems theory]]. General systems theory focuses similarly on the collective behaviors of interacting entities, but it studies a much broader class of systems, including non-complex systems where traditional reductionist approaches may remain viable. Indeed, systems theory seeks to explore and describe ''all'' classes of systems, and the invention of categories that are useful to researchers across widely varying fields is one of systems theory's main objectives.

As it relates to complex systems, systems theory contributes an emphasis on the way relationships and dependencies between a system's parts can determine system-wide properties. It also contributes the interdisciplinary perspective of the study of complex systems: the notion that shared properties link systems across disciplines, justifying the pursuit of modeling approaches applicable to complex systems wherever they appear. Specific concepts important to complex systems, such as emergence, feedback loops, and adaptation, also originate in systems theory.

=== Complexity ===
Systems exhibit complexity means that their behaviors cannot be easily implied from the very properties that make them difficult to model, and the complex behaviors are governed entirely, or almost entirely, by the behaviors those properties produce. Any modeling approach that ignores such difficulties or characterizes them as noise, then, will necessarily produce models that are neither accurate nor useful. As yet no fully general theory of complex systems has emerged for addressing these problems, so researchers must solve them in domain-specific contexts. Researchers in complex systems address these problems by viewing the chief task of modeling to be capturing, rather than reducing, the complexity of their respective systems of interest.

While no generally accepted exact definition of complexity exists yet, there are many archetypal examples of complexity. Systems can be complex if, for instance, they have [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior (behavior that exhibits extreme sensitivity to initial conditions), or if they have [[Emergence|emergent]] properties (properties that are not apparent from their components in isolation but which result from the relationships and dependencies they form when placed together in a system), or if they are computationally intractable to model (if they depend on a number of parameters that grows too rapidly with respect to the size of the system).

=== Networks ===
The interacting components of a complex system form a [[Network theory|network]], which is a collection of discrete objects and relationships between them, usually depicted as a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] of vertices connected by edges. Networks can describe the relationships between individuals within an organization, between [[logic gate]]s in a [[Circuit (computer science)|circuit]], between [[gene]]s in [[gene regulatory network]]s, or between any other set of related entities.

Networks often describe the sources of complexity in complex systems. Studying complex systems as networks therefore enables many useful applications of [[graph theory]] and [[network science]]. Some complex systems, for example, are also [[complex network]]s, which have properties such as phase transitions and power-law degree distributions that readily lend themselves to emergent or chaotic behavior. The fact that the number of edges in a [[complete graph]] grows [[Quadratic growth|quadratically]] in the number of vertices sheds additional light on the source of complexity in large networks: as a network grows, the number of relationships between entities quickly dwarfs the number of entities in the network.

=== Nonlinearity ===
[[File:A Trajectory Through Phase Space in a Lorenz Attractor.gif|frame|border|right|A sample solution in the Lorenz attractor when ρ = 28, σ = 10, and β = 8/3]]
Complex systems often have nonlinear behavior, meaning they may respond in different ways to the same input depending on their state or context. In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], nonlinearity describes systems in which a change in the size of the input does not produce a proportional change in the size of the output. For a given change in input, such systems may yield significantly greater than or less than proportional changes in output, or even no output at all, depending on the current state of the system or its parameter values.

Of particular interest to complex systems are [[nonlinear dynamical systems]], which are systems of [[differential equation]]s that have one or more nonlinear terms. Some nonlinear dynamical systems, such as the [[Lorenz system]], can produce a mathematical phenomenon known as [[Chaos theory|chaos]]. Chaos as it applies to complex systems refers to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, or "[[butterfly effect]]," that a complex system can exhibit. In such a system, small changes to initial conditions can lead to dramatically different outcomes. Chaotic behavior can therefore be extremely hard to model numerically, because small rounding errors at an intermediate stage of computation can cause the model to generate completely inaccurate output. Furthermore, if a complex system returns to a state similar to one it held previously, it may behave completely differently in response to exactly the same stimuli, so chaos also poses challenges for extrapolating from past experience.

=== Emergence ===
[[File:Gospers glider gun.gif|frame|right|[[Bill Gosper|Gosper's]] [[Gun (cellular automaton)|Glider Gun]] creating "[[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]]" in the cellular automaton [[Conway's Game of Life]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Dennett]] (1995), ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', Penguin Books, London, {{ISBN|978-0-14-016734-4}}, {{ISBN|0-14-016734-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another common feature of complex systems is the presence of emergent behaviors and properties: these are traits of a system which are not apparent from its components in isolation but which result from the interactions, dependencies, or relationships they form when placed together in a system. [[Emergence]] broadly describes the appearance of such behaviors and properties, and has applications to systems studied in both the social and physical sciences. While emergence is often used to refer only to the appearance of unplanned organized behavior in a complex system, emergence can also refer to the breakdown of organization; it describes any phenomena which are difficult or even impossible to predict from the smaller entities that make up the system.

One example of complex system whose emergent properties have been studied extensively is [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]]. In a cellular automaton, a grid of cells, each having one of finitely many states, evolves over time according to a simple set of rules. These rules guide the "interactions" of each cell with its neighbors. Although the rules are only defined locally, they have been shown capable of producing globally interesting behavior, for example in [[Conway's Game of Life]].

==== Spontaneous order and self-organization ====
When emergence describes the appearance of unplanned order, it is [[spontaneous order]] (in the social sciences) or [[self-organization]] (in physical sciences). Spontaneous order can be seen in [[herd behavior]], whereby a group of individuals coordinates their actions without centralized planning. Self-organization can be seen in the global symmetry of certain [[crystal]]s, for instance the apparent radial [[symmetry]] of [[snowflake]]s, which arises from purely local [[Intermolecular force|attractive and repulsive forces]] both between water molecules and between water molecules and their surrounding environment.

=== Adaptation ===
[[Complex adaptive system]]s are special cases of complex systems that are [[adaptive]] in that they have the capacity to change and learn from experience. Examples of complex adaptive systems include the [[stock market]], social insect and [[ant]] colonies, the [[biosphere]] and the [[ecosystem]], the [[Human brain|brain]] and the [[immune system]], the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and the developing [[embryo]], the cities, [[Manufacturing|manufacturing businesses]] and any human social group-based endeavor in a cultural and [[social system]] such as [[Political party|political parties]] or [[Community|communities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1473095218780515 On the ‘complexity turn’ in planning: An adaptive rationale to navigate spaces and times of uncertainty]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Complex systems may have a memory

Natural complex systems often exhibit such topologies. In the human [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] for example, we see dense local connectivity and a few very long [[axonal|axon]] projections between regions inside the cortex and to other brain regions.

;May produce emergent phenomena
:Complex systems may exhibit behaviors that are [[emergence|emergent]], which is to say that while the results may be sufficiently determined by the activity of the systems' basic constituents, they may have properties that can only be studied at a higher level.  For example, the [[termites]] in a mound have physiology, biochemistry and biological development that are at one level of analysis, but their [[social behavior]] and mound building is a property that emerges from the collection of termites and needs to be analysed at a different level.

;Relationships are non-linear
:In practical terms, this means a small perturbation may cause a large effect (see [[butterfly effect]]), a proportional effect, or even no effect at all. In linear systems, effect is ''always'' directly proportional to cause. See [[nonlinearity]].

;Relationships contain feedback loops

[[File:2018 Map of the Complexity Sciences.jpg|thumb|360px|A perspective on the development of complexity science: http://www.art-sciencefactory.com/complexity-map_feb09.html|alt= http://www.art-sciencefactory.com/complexity-map_feb09.html]]

Although it is arguable that humans have been studying complex systems for thousands of years, the modern scientific study of complex systems is relatively young in comparison to established fields of science such as [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. The history of the scientific study of these systems follows several different research trends.

In the area of [[mathematics]], arguably the largest contribution to the study of complex systems was the discovery of [[chaos theory|chaos]] in [[deterministic]] systems, a feature of certain [[dynamical systems]] that is strongly related to [[nonlinearity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irit.fr/COSI/training/complexity-tutorial/history-of-complex-systems.htm History of Complex Systems&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123171158/http://www.irit.fr/COSI/training/complexity-tutorial/history-of-complex-systems.htm |date=2007-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study of [[neural networks]] was also integral in advancing the mathematics needed to study complex systems.

The notion of [[self-organizing]] systems is tied with work in [[nonequilibrium thermodynamics]], including that pioneered by [[chemist]] and [[Nobel laureate]] [[Ilya Prigogine]] in his study of [[dissipative structures]]. Even older is the work by [[Hartree-Fock]] c.s. on the [[quantum-chemistry]] equations and later calculations of the structure of molecules which can be regarded as one of the earliest examples of emergence and emergent wholes in science.

One complex system containing humans is the classical political economy of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], later developed by the [[Austrian school of economics]], which argues that order in market systems is spontaneous (or [[Emergence|emergent]]) in that it is the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Adam |authorlink=Adam Ferguson |coauthors= |title=An Essay on the History of Civil Society |publisher=T. Cadell |year=1767 |location=London |pages=Part the Third, Section II, p. 205 |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1428&amp;Itemid=28 |doi= |id= |isbn= |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Hayek, "The Results of Human Action but Not of Human Design" in ''New Studies in Philosophy, Politics, Economics'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978, pp. 96–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon this the Austrian school developed from the 19th to the early 20th century the [[economic calculation problem]], along with the concept of [[dispersed knowledge]], which were to fuel debates against the then-dominant [[Keynesian economics]]. This debate would notably lead economists, politicians and other parties to explore the question of [[Economic calculation problem#Computational complexity|computational complexity]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

A pioneer in the field, and inspired by [[Karl Popper]]'s and [[Warren Weaver]]'s works, Nobel prize economist and philosopher [[Friedrich Hayek]] dedicated much of his work, from early to the late 20th century, to the study of complex phenomena,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Caldwell, Popper and Hayek: [http://www.unites.uqam.ca/philo/pdf/Caldwell_2003-01.pdf Who influenced whom?], Karl Popper 2002 Centenary Congress, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; not constraining his work to human economies but venturing into other fields such as [[psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich von Hayek, ''The Sensory Order: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Theoretical Psychology'', The University of Chicago Press, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; [[biology]] and [[cybernetics]].  [[Gregory Bateson]] played a key role in establishing the connection between anthropology and systems theory; he recognized that the interactive parts of cultures function much like ecosystems.

While the explicit study of complex systems dates at least to the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vemuri |first=V. |date=1978 |title=Modeling of Complex Systems: An Introduction |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press|isbn=0127165509}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first research institute focused on complex systems, the [[Santa Fe Institute]], was founded in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ledford | first1 = H | year = 2015 | title = How to solve the world's biggest problems | url = http://www.nature.com/news/how-to-solve-the-world-s-biggest-problems-1.18367 | journal = Nature | volume = 525 | issue = 7569| pages = 308–311 | doi=10.1038/525308a| bibcode = 2015Natur.525..308L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.santafe.edu/about/history|title=History {{!}} Santa Fe Institute|website=www.santafe.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Santa Fe Institute participants included physics Nobel laureates [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]], economics Nobel laureate [[Kenneth Arrow]], and Manhattan Project scientists [[George Cowan]] and [[Herbert L. Anderson|Herb Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldrop, M. M. (1993). [https://books.google.com/books/about/Complexity.html?id=JTRJxYK_tZsC Complexity: The emerging science at the edge of order and chaos.] Simon and Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are over 50 [[#Institutes_and_research_centers|institutes and research centers]] focusing on complex systems. A scientific society called [https://cssociety.org/home Complex Systems Society] organizes every year a general conference on these topics.

== Applications ==

===Complexity in practice===
The traditional approach to dealing with complexity is to reduce or constrain it. Typically, this involves compartmentalisation: dividing a large system into separate parts. Organizations, for instance, divide their work into departments that each deal with separate issues. Engineering systems are often designed using modular components. However, modular designs become susceptible to failure when issues arise that bridge the divisions.

===Complexity management===
As projects and [[acquisitions]] become increasingly complex, companies and governments are challenged to find effective ways to manage mega-acquisitions such as the Army [[Future Combat Systems]].  Acquisitions such as the [[Future Combat Systems|FCS]] rely on a web of interrelated parts which interact unpredictably.  As acquisitions become more network-centric and complex, businesses will be forced to find ways to manage complexity while governments will be challenged to provide effective governance to ensure flexibility and resiliency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csis.org/files/publication/090410_Organizing_for_a_Complex_World_The_Way_Ahead_0.pdf CSIS paper: "Organizing for a Complex World: The Way Ahead]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity economics===
Over the last decades, within the emerging field of [[complexity economics]] new predictive tools have been developed to explain economic growth. Such is the case with the models built by the [[Santa Fe Institute]] in 1989 and the more recent [[economic complexity index]] (ECI), introduced by the [[MIT]] physicist [[Cesar A. Hidalgo]] and the [[Harvard]] economist [[Ricardo Hausmann]]. Based on the ECI, Hausmann, Hidalgo and their team of [[The Observatory of Economic Complexity]] have [[List of countries by future GDP (based on ECI) estimates|produced GDP forecasts for the year 2020]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Complexity and education ===
Focusing on issues of student persistence with their studies, Forsman, Moll and Linder explore the "viability of using complexity science as a frame to extend methodological applications for physics education research", finding that "framing a social network analysis within a complexity science perspective offers a new and powerful applicability across a broad range of PER topics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forsman|first=Jonas|last2=Moll|first2=Rachel|last3=Linder|first3=Cedric|date=2014|title=Extending the theoretical framing for physics education research: An illustrative application of complexity science|url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.10.020122|journal=Physical Review Special Topics: Physics Education Research|volume=10|issue=2|doi=10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.10.020122|id=http://hdl.handle.net/10613/2583|bibcode=2014PRPER..10b0122F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity and modeling===
One of Friedrich Hayek's main contributions to early complexity theory is his distinction between the human capacity to predict the behaviour of simple systems and its capacity to predict the behaviour of complex systems through [[Scientific modelling|modeling]]. He believed that economics and the sciences of complex phenomena in general, which in his view included biology, psychology, and so on, could not be modeled after the sciences that deal with essentially simple phenomena like physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/33304.html Reason Magazine - The Road from Serfdom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek would notably explain that complex phenomena, through modeling, can only allow pattern predictions, compared with the precise predictions that can be made out of non-complex phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1974/hayek-lecture.html Friedrich August von Hayek - Prize Lecture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity and chaos theory===
Complexity theory is rooted in [[chaos theory]], which in turn has its origins more than a century ago in the work of the French mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]]. Chaos is sometimes viewed as extremely complicated information, rather than as an absence of order.&lt;ref&gt;Hayles, N. K. (1991). ''Chaos Bound: Orderly Disorder in Contemporary Literature and Science''. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaotic systems remain deterministic, though their long-term behavior can be difficult to predict with any accuracy. With perfect knowledge of the initial conditions and of the relevant equations describing the chaotic system's behavior, one can theoretically make perfectly accurate predictions about the future of the system, though in practice this is impossible to do with arbitrary accuracy. [[Ilya Prigogine]] argued&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I. (1997). ''The End of Certainty'', The Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; that complexity is non-deterministic, and gives no way whatsoever to precisely predict the future.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite journal |author=D. Carfì |year=2008 |title=Superpositions in Prigogine approach to irreversibility |journal=AAPP: Physical, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |url=http://cab.unime.it/journals/index.php/AAPP/article/view/384/0 |format= |accessdate=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of complexity theory shows a domain between deterministic order and randomness which is complex.&lt;ref name="PC98"&gt;[[Paul Cilliers|Cilliers, P.]] (1998). ''Complexity and Postmodernism: Understanding Complex Systems'', Routledge, London.&lt;/ref&gt; This is referred as the "[[edge of chaos]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Per Bak]] (1996). ''How Nature Works: The Science of Self-Organized Criticality'', Copernicus, New York, U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|left|200px|A plot of the [[Lorenz attractor]].]]

When one analyzes complex systems, sensitivity to initial conditions, for example, is not an issue as important as it is within chaos theory, in which it prevails. As stated by Colander,&lt;ref&gt;Colander, D. (2000). ''The Complexity Vision and the Teaching of Economics'', E. Elgar, Northampton, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; the study of complexity is the opposite of the study of chaos. Complexity is about how a huge number of extremely complicated and dynamic sets of relationships can generate some simple behavioral patterns, whereas chaotic behavior, in the sense of deterministic chaos, is the result of a relatively small number of non-linear interactions.&lt;ref name="PC98"/&gt;

Therefore, the main difference between chaotic systems and complex systems is their history.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, M. (2000). ''Ubiquity : Why catastrophes happen'', three river press, New-York.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaotic systems do not rely on their history as complex ones do. Chaotic behaviour pushes a system in equilibrium into chaotic order, which means, in other words, out of what we traditionally define as 'order'.{{clarify|date=September 2011}} On the other hand, complex systems evolve far from equilibrium at the edge of chaos. They evolve at a critical state built up by a history of irreversible and unexpected events, which physicist [[Murray Gell-Mann]] called "an accumulation of frozen accidents".&lt;ref&gt;Gell-Mann, M. (1995). What is Complexity?  Complexity 1/1, 16-19&lt;/ref&gt; In a sense chaotic systems can be regarded as a subset of complex systems distinguished precisely by this absence of historical dependence. Many real complex systems are, in practice and over long but finite time periods, robust. However, they do possess the potential for radical qualitative change of kind whilst retaining systemic integrity. Metamorphosis serves as perhaps more than a metaphor for such transformations.

===Complexity and network science===
A complex system is usually composed of many components and their interactions. Such a system can be represented by a network where nodes represent the components and links represent their interactions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DorogovtsevMendes2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dorogovtsev|first1=S.N.|last2=Mendes|first2=J.F.F.|year=2003|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198515906.001.0001|title=Evolution of Networks|arxiv=cond-mat/0106144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General form of complexity computation===

The computational law of reachable optimality&lt;ref&gt;Wenliang Wang (2015). Pooling Game Theory and Public Pension Plan. {{ISBN|978-1507658246}}. Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; is established as a general form of computation for ordered systems and it reveals complexity computation is a compound computation of optimal choice and optimality driven reaching pattern over time underlying a specific and any experience path of ordered system within the general limitation of system integrity.

The computational law of reachable optimality has four key components as described below.

1. '''Reachability of Optimality''': Any intended optimality shall be reachable. Unreachable optimality has no meaning for a member in the ordered system and even for the ordered system itself.

2. '''Prevailing and Consistency''': Maximizing reachability to explore best available optimality is the prevailing computation logic for all members in the ordered system and is accommodated by the ordered system.

3. '''Conditionality''': Realizable tradeoff between reachability and optimality depends primarily upon the initial bet capacity and how the bet capacity evolves along with the payoff table update path triggered by bet behavior and empowered by the underlying law of reward and punishment. Precisely, it is a sequence of conditional events where the next event happens upon reached status quo from experience path.

4. '''Robustness''': The more challenge a reachable optimality can accommodate, the more robust it is in term of path integrity.

There are also four computation features in the law of reachable optimality.

1. '''Optimal Choice''': Computation in realizing Optimal Choice can be very simple or very complex. A simple rule in Optimal Choice is to accept whatever is reached, Reward As You Go (RAYG). A Reachable Optimality computation reduces into optimizing reachability when RAYG is adopted. The Optimal Choice computation can be more complex when multiple NE strategies present in a reached game.

2. '''Initial Status''': Computation is assumed to start at an interested beginning even the absolute beginning of an ordered system in nature may not and need not present. An assumed neutral Initial Status facilitates an artificial or a simulating computation and is not expected to change the prevalence of any findings.

3. '''Territory''': An ordered system shall have a territory where the universal computation sponsored by the system will produce an optimal solution still within the territory.

4. '''Reaching Pattern''': The forms of Reaching Pattern in the computation space, or the Optimality Driven Reaching Pattern in the computation space, primarily depend upon the nature and dimensions of measure space underlying a computation space and the law of punishment and reward underlying the realized experience path of reaching. There are five basic forms of experience path we are interested in, persistently positive reinforcement experience path, persistently [[negative reinforcement]] experience path, mixed persistent pattern experience path, decaying scale experience path and selection experience path.

The compound computation in selection experience path includes current and lagging interaction, dynamic topological transformation and implies  both invariance and variance characteristics in an ordered system's experience path.

In addition, the computation law of reachable optimality gives out the boundary between complexity model, chaotic model and determination model. When RAYG is the Optimal Choice computation, and the reaching pattern is a persistently positive experience path, persistently negative experience path, or mixed persistent pattern experience path, the underlying computation shall be a simple system computation adopting determination rules. If the reaching pattern has no persistent pattern experienced in RAYG regime, the underlying computation hints there is a chaotic system. When the optimal choice computation involves non-RAYG computation, it's a complexity computation driving the compound effect.

[[File:Corruption Perception index 2017.svg|thumb|upright=2.35|Corruption Perceptions Index, 2017]]
The '''Corruption Perceptions Index''' ('''CPI''') is an index published annually by [[Transparency International]] since 1995 which ranks countries "by their perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys."&lt;ref name=cpi&gt;{{cite web|title=Corruption Perceptions Index|url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi|work=Transparency International|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=1 December 2011|author=Transparency International|authorlink=Transparency International|year=2011|df=}}{{dead link|date=November 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPI generally defines [[corruption]] as "the misuse of public power for private benefit".&lt;ref name=cpilong2&gt;CPI 2010: Long methodological brief, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPI currently ranks 176 countries "on a scale from 100 (very clean) to 0 (highly corrupt)". Denmark and New Zealand are perceived as the least corrupt countries in the world, ranking consistently high among international financial transparency, while the most perceived corrupt country in the world is Somalia, ranking at 9 out of 100 since 2017&lt;ref name=cpidetail&gt;{{cite web|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2017|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017 |work=Transparency International|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=14 August 2017|author=Transparency International|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
{{Political corruption sidebar}}
Transparency International commissioned the [[University of Passau]]'s [[:de:Johann Graf Lambsdorff|Johann Graf Lambsdorff]] to produce the CPI.&lt;ref name=2005FAQ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icgg.org/corruption.cpi_2005_faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions: TI Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI 2005) |accessdate=22 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 CPI takes into account 16 different surveys and assessments from 12 different institutions.&lt;ref name=cpilong1&gt;CPI 2010: Long methodological brief, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The 13 surveys/assessments are either business people opinion surveys or performance assessments from a group of analysts.&lt;ref name=cpilong2/&gt; Early CPIs used public opinion surveys.&lt;ref name=cpilong7/&gt; The institutions are:

* [[African Development Bank]] (based in Ivory Coast)
* [[Bertelsmann Foundation]] (based in Germany)
* [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] (based in UK)
* [[Freedom House]] (based in US)
* [[Global Insight]] (based in US)
* [[International Institute for Management Development]] (based in Switzerland)
* Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (based in Hong Kong)
* The PRS Group, Inc., (based in US) 
* [[World Economic Forum]]
* [[World Bank]] 
* [[World Justice Project]](based in US)&lt;ref name=cpisources&gt;{{Cite report |title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2010: Sources of information |url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/55815/891318/CPI2010_sources_EN.pdf |author=Transparency International |year=2010 |publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries need to be evaluated by at least three sources to appear in the CPI.&lt;ref name=cpilong7&gt;CPI 2010: Long methodological brief, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The CPI measures perception of corruption due to the difficulty of measuring absolute levels of corruption.&lt;ref name=cpifaq&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions (FAQs)|url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/faqs|work=Corruption Perceptions Index 2010|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=24 August 2011|author=Transparency International|authorlink=Transparency International|year=2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902224108/http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/faqs|archive-date=2011-09-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Validity===
A study published in 2002 found a "very strong significant correlation" between the Corruption Perceptions Index and two other proxies for corruption: black market activity and overabundance of regulation.

All three metrics also had a highly significant correlation with real gross domestic product per capita (RGDP/Cap); the Corruption Perceptions Index correlation with RGDP/Cap was the strongest, explaining over three fourths of the variance.&lt;ref name=ivcp&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilhelm  | first = Paul G. | title = International Validation of the Corruption Perceptions Index: Implications for Business Ethics and Entrepreneurship Education  | journal = Journal of Business Ethics  | volume = 35  | issue = 3  | pages = 177–189  | publisher =  Springer Netherlands  | location =  | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1023/A:1013882225402 }}&lt;!--| accessdate = 21 July 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that a lower index on this scale reflects greater corruption, so that countries with higher RGDPs generally had less corruption.)

==Economic implications==
Research papers published in 2007 and 2008 examined the economic consequences of corruption perception, as defined by the CPI.  The researchers found a correlation between a higher CPI and higher long-term economic growth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shao | first1 = J. | last2 = Ivanov | first2 = P. C. | last3 = Podobnik | first3 = B. | last4 = Stanley | first4 = H. E. | title = Quantitative relations between corruption and economic factors | doi = 10.1140/epjb/e2007-00098-2 | journal = The European Physical Journal B | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 157 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0705.0161 |bibcode = 2007EPJB...56..157S }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an increase in [[GDP]] growth of 1.7% for every unit increase in a country's CPI score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Podobnik | first1 = B. | last2 = Shao | first2 = J. | last3 = Njavro | first3 = D. | last4 = Ivanov | first4 = P. C. | last5 = Stanley | first5 = H. E. | title = Influence of corruption on economic growth rate and foreign investment | doi = 10.1140/epjb/e2008-00210-2 | journal = The European Physical Journal B | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 547 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0710.1995 |bibcode = 2008EPJB...63..547P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also shown was a [[power-law]] dependence linking higher CPI score to higher rates of foreign investment in a country.

==Criticism and limitations==
Because corruption is willfully hidden, it is impossible to measure directly; instead, [[Proxy (statistics)|proxies]] for corruption are used. Seligson states that corruption is a very "difficult phenomenon to measure", there have been many attempts to solve this problem but they've all come up with limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Seligson, Mitchell A. "The Impact of Corruption on Regime Legitimacy: A Comparative Study of Four Latin American Countries." ''Journal of Politics''(2002): 408-433.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Index has been criticized on the basis of its methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/TransparencyInternationalCorruptionIndex.pdf|title = Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index: Whose Perceptions Are They Anyway?|date = 2005|access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to political scientist Dan Hough, three flaws in the Index include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Here’s this year’s (flawed) Corruption Perception Index. Those flaws are useful.|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/01/27/how-do-you-measure-corruption-transparency-international-does-its-best-and-thats-useful/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2016-01-27|access-date = 2016-01-27|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Dan|last = Hough}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Corruption is too complex to be captured by a single score. The nature of corruption in rural Kansas will, for instance, be different from that in the city administration of New York, yet the Index measures them in the same way.
* By measuring perceptions of corruption, as opposed to corruption itself, the Index may simply be reinforcing stereotypes and cliches.
* The Index only measures public-sector corruption, leaving out private actors. This for instance means the [[Libor scandal]] or the [[Volkswagen emissions scandal|VW emissions scandal]] are not counted.
Media outlets frequently use the raw numbers as a yardstick for government performance, without clarifying what the numbers mean. The local Transparency International chapter in [[Bangladesh]] disowned the index results after a change in methodology caused the country's scores to increase; media reported it as an "improvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Werve, Jonathan|title=TI's Index: Local Chapter Not Having It|url=http://globalintegrity.org/node/266|website=[[Global Integrity]]|date=2008-09-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514053437/http://globalintegrity.org/node/266|archivedate=2013-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 article in ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'', Alex Cobham suggested that CPI should be dropped for the good of Transparency International. It argues that the CPI embeds a powerful and misleading elite bias in popular perceptions of corruption, potentially contributing to a vicious cycle and at the same time incentivizing inappropriate policy responses. Cobham writes, "the index corrupts perceptions to the extent that it's hard to see a justification for its continuing publication."&lt;ref name="Cobham, Alex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Corrupting Perceptions|author=Cobham, Alex|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/07/22/corrupting_perceptions|journal=[[Foreign Policy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent econometric analyses that have exploited the existence of natural experiments on the level of corruption and compared the CPI with other subjective indicators have found that, while not perfect, the CPI does appear to consistently and validly measure the magnitude of corruption across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/113281515516828746/pdf/WPS8299.pdf |title= Can We Measure the Power of the Grabbing Hand? A Comparative Analysis of Different Indicators of Corruption|last=Hamilton|first= Alexander|date=2017|website=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, many lawyers advise international businesses to consult the CPI when attempting to measure the risk of [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] violations in different nations. This practice has been criticized by the ''Minnesota Journal of International Law'', which wrote that since the CPI may be subject to perceptual biases it therefore should not be considered by lawyers to be a measure of actual national corruption risk.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Campbell, Stuart Vincent.  [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2210019 "Perception is Not Reality: The FCPA, Brazil, and the Mismeasurement of Corruption"] 22 ''Minnesota Journal of International Law'' 1, p. 247 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International also publishes the [[Global Corruption Barometer]], which ranks countries by corruption levels using direct surveys instead of perceived expert opinions, which has been under criticism for substantial bias from the powerful elite.&lt;ref name="Cobham, Alex"/&gt;

Transparency International has warned that a country with a clean CPI score may still be linked to corruption internationally. For example, while Sweden had the 3rd best CPI score in 2015, one of its state-owned companies, [[TeliaSonera]], was facing allegations of bribery in Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name=cpi2015&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015 CPI index 2015]. Accessed 2016-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematical modeling]], '''deterministic simulations''' contain no [[random variable]]s and no degree of [[randomness]], and consist mostly of equations, for example [[difference equation]]s.  These [[simulation]]s have known inputs and they result in a unique set of outputs. Contrast [[Stochastic simulation|stochastic (probability) simulation]], which includes random variables. 

Deterministic simulation models are usually designed to capture some underlying [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]] or natural process. They are different from [[statistical model]]s (for example linear regression) whose aim is to [[empirical]]ly estimate the relationships between [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. The deterministic model is viewed as a useful approximation of reality that is easier to build and interpret than a stochastic model. However, such models can be extremely complicated with large numbers of inputs and outputs, and therefore are often noninvertible; a fixed single set of outputs can be generated by multiple sets of inputs. Thus taking reliable account of parameter and model uncertainty is crucial, perhaps even more so than for standard statistical models, yet this is an area that has received little attention from statisticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poole|first=David|author2=Adrian E. Raftery|title=Inference for Deterministic Simulation Models: The Bayesian Melding Approach|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|date=December 2000|volume=95|issue=452|pages=1244–1255|doi=10.1080/01621459.2000.10474324|citeseerx=10.1.1.142.8834}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 January 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of simulations==

Mostly are deterministic simulations used in scientific researches, we can found in various studies about populations fields, climate development, pollution, but also in another areas as engineering, chemistry and policy making. Deterministic simulations have received attention in the statistical literature under the general topic of computer experiments. Computer experiments simulate complex system which requires a number of inputs. Use of stochastic system is much cheaper but also inaccurate and simplifying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumar |first=B.|authorlink=B. Kumar and E. S. Davidson |year=1978 |title=Performance evaluation of highly concurrent computers by deterministic simulation  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model translation===

It is necessary to translate model into computer recognizable format. Modeler must decide if whether to program the model in a simulation language such as [[GPSS/H]] or to use special purpose simulation software:

'''Arene''' – discrete event simulator has also academic version

'''CSIM''' – CSIM is a re-usable general purpose discrete-event simulation environment for modeling complex systems of interacting elements. It contains hierarchical block diagram tools and extensive model libraries covering several domains. CSIM can be used for modeling: agent-based systems, logistics, wireless networks, computer networks...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to ATL's CSIM Modeling Environment|url=http://www.atl.external.lmco.com/projects/csim/overview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

'''Dynare''' – when the framework is deterministic, can be used for models with the assumption of perfect foresight. The purpose of the simulation is to describe the reaction in anticipation of, then in reaction to the shock, until the system returns to the old or to a new state of equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dynare reference manual|url=http://www.dynare.org/manual/index_22.html|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Janus''' – Janus is an interactive simulation war game portraying realistic events during multi-sided combat. It uses digitized terrain effecting line of sight and movement, depicting contour lines, roads, rivers, vegetation and urban areas. It has the capability to be networked with other systems, in order to simulate a war game with multiple sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Use of the Janus Wargame Simulation to Investigate Naturalistic Decision-Making: A Preliminary Examination|author=Taryn Chapman |author2=Vanessa Mills |author3=Monique Kardos |author4=Christina Stothard |author5=Douglas Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Modsaf''' (Modular Semi-Automated Forces) is a set of software modules and applications used to construct Advanced Distributed Simulation (ADS) and Computer Generated Forces (CGF) applications. ModSAF modules and applications let a single operator create and control large numbers of entities that are used for realistic training, test, and evaluation on the virtual battlefield. ModSAF contains entities that are sufficiently realistic resulting in the user not being aware that the displayed vehicles are being maneuvered by computers, rather than human crews. These entities, which include ground and air vehicles, dismounted infantry (DI), missiles, and dynamic structures, can interact with each other and with manned individual entity simulators to support training, combat development experiments, and test of evaluation studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ModSAF (Modular Semi-Automated Forces)|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~arpi/SUO/MODULES/modsaf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Taylor Enterprise Dynamics''' is an objectoriented software system used to model, simulate, visualize, and monitor dynamic-flow process activities and systems. With Taylor ED’s [[open architecture]], software users can access standard libraries of atoms to build models. Atoms are Taylor ED’s smart objects  and model building resources. In addition to Taylor ED’s standard atom libraries, users can create new atoms themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hullinger |first=Roger|title=Taylor Enterprise Dynamics |url=http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc01papers/033.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example of deterministic simulations===

'''Performance evaluation of highly concurrent computers B. Kumar and E. S. Davidson Object of the simulation is CPU memory subsystem IBM 360/91.''' 

Simulation is presented as a practical technique for performance evaluation of alternative configurations of highly concurrent computers. A technique is described for constructing a detailed deterministic simulation model of a system. In the model a control stream replaces the instruction and data streams of the real system. Simulation of the system model yields the timing and resource usage statistics needed for performance evaluation, without the necessity of emulating the system. As a case study, the implementation of a simulator of a model of the CPUmemory subsystem of the IBM 360/91 is described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumar |first=B.|authorlink=B. Kumar and E. S. Davidson |year=1978 |title=Performance evaluation of highly concurrent computers by deterministic simulation  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''A comparison of deterministic vs stochastic simulation models for assessing adaptive information management techniques over disadvantaged tactical communication networks – Dr. Allan Gibb Mr. Jean-Claude St-Jacques'''

Use of a deterministic battlefield model based on a scripted scenario will provide the required
reproducibility and full control over event sequencing. A stochastic battlefield model, as provided in computer simulation applications like JANUS and ModSAF, produces results that can be made strictly reproducible if the same random number seed can be employed. However, such a model will not provide full human control over scenario composition and event sequencing. A deterministic battlefield model offers clear advantages for the test bed studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibb|first=Allan |author2=Jean-Claude St-Jacques |author3=Gerard Nourry |author4=Tim Johnson|title=A Comparison of Deterministic vs Stochastic Simulation Models for Assessing Adaptive Information Management Techniques over Disadvantaged Tactical Communication Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''disquotational principle''' is a philosophical [[theorem]]{{Citation needed|reason=What/where is the proof?|date=January 2018}} which holds that a rational speaker will accept "''p''" if and only if he or she believes ''p''. The quotes indicate that the statement ''p'' [[use–mention distinction|is being treated as a sentence, and not as a proposition]]. This principle is presupposed by claims that hold that [[First-order_logic#Equality_and_its_axioms|substitution]] fails in certain [[intension]]al contexts.

==Overview==
Consider the following argument:
:(1) Sally accepts the assertion that "[[Cicero]] was a famous [[orator]]" while dissenting from the assertion that "Tully was a famous [[orator]]".
:(2) Cicero is Tully
:Therefore, (3) Sally believes that Tully was a famous orator.

To derive (3), we have to assume that when Sally accepts that "Cicero was a famous orator", she believes that Cicero was a famous orator. Then we can exchange Cicero for Tully, and derive (3). [[Bertrand Russell]] thought that this demonstrated the failure of substitutivity of identicals in [[intension]]al contexts.

In "A Puzzle about Belief,"&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. "A Puzzle about Belief." First appeared in, ''Meaning and Use''. ed., A. Margalit. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1979. pp. 239–283&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Kripke]] argues that the application of the disquotational theorem can yield a paradox on its own, without appeal to the substitution principle, and that this may show that the problem lies with the former, and not the latter. There are various formulations of this argument.

Suppose that, Pierre, a Frenchman, comes to believe that (1) "''Londres est jolie''" (London is pretty), without ever having visited the city. Later in life, Pierre ends up living in London. He finds no French speakers there (he does not speak English yet), and everyone refers to the city as "London," not ''Londres''. He finds this city decidedly unattractive, for the neighborhood he decides to live in is decidedly unattractive. Over time, he learns English, and formulates the belief that (2) "''London is not pretty''". Pierre never realizes that London is the English word for ''Londres''. Now with the disquotational principle, we can deduce from (1) that Pierre believes the proposition that ''Londres est jolie''. With a weak principle of translation (e.g., "a proposition in language A is the same as a semantically identical proposition in language B" [note that a proposition is not the same as a sentence]), we can now deduce that Pierre believes that London is pretty. But we can also deduce from (2) and the disquotational principle that Pierre believes that London is not pretty. These deductions can be made ''even though Pierre has made no logical blunders in forming his beliefs''. Without the disquotational principle, this contradiction could not be derived, because we would not be able to assume that (1) and (2) meant anything in particular.

This paradox can also be derived without appeal to another language. Suppose that Pierre assents to the proposition that "[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] had musical talent", perhaps having heard that this man was a famous pianist. With the disquotational principle, we can deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had musical talent. Now suppose that Pierre overhears a friend discussing the political exploits of a certain statesman, [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]], without knowing that the two Paderewskis are the same man. Pierre's background tells him that statesmen are generally not very gifted in music, and this leads him to the belief that Paderewski had no musical talent. The disquotation principle allows us to deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had no musical talent. Using this principle, we have now deduced that Pierre believes that Paderewski had musical talent, and does not believe that Paderewski had musical talent, ''even though Pierre's beliefs were formed logically''.

'''Distinction''', the fundamental philosophical [[abstraction]], involves the recognition of difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sokolowski|first=Robert|date=1998-01-01|title=The Method of Philosophy: Making Distinctions|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SOKTMO|journal=Review of Metaphysics|volume=51|issue=3|pages=515–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical philosophy, there were various ways in which things could be distinguished. The merely logical or virtual distinction, such as the difference between concavity and convexity, involves the mental apprehension of two definitions, but which cannot be realized outside the mind, as any concave line would be a convex line considered from another perspective. A real distinction involves a level of [[Ontology|ontological]] separation, as when squirrels are distinguished from llamas (for no squirrel is a llama, and no llama is a squirrel).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmhCGt9hKC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=copleston+history+of+philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKq8HBtozTAhUIRCYKHecUDC8Q6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=formal%20distinction&amp;f=false|title=History of Philosophy Volume 2: Medieval Philosophy|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|date=2003-06-12|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780826468963|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A real distinction is thus different than a merely conceptual one, in that in a real distinction, one of the terms can be realized in reality without the other being realized.

Later developments include [[Duns Scotus|Duns Scotus's]] [[formal distinction]], which developed in part out of the recognition in previous authors that there need to be an intermediary between logical and real distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wengert|first=R. G.|last2=Institute|first2=The Hegeler|date=1965-11-01|title=The Development of the Doctrine of the Formal Distinction in the Lectura Prima of John Duns Scotus|url=https://www.pdcnet.org//pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=monist&amp;id=monist_1965_0049_0004_0571_0587&amp;onlyautologin=true|journal=Monist|volume=49|issue=4|pages=571–587|doi=10.5840/monist196549435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some relevant distinctions to the history of Western philosophy include:
* [[Contingency (philosophy)|Necessity and Contingency]]
* [[Inductive reasoning|Inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|Deductive]]

== Distinctions in Contemporary Thought ==

=== [[Analytic–synthetic distinction]] ===
While the there are anticipation of this distinction prior to Kant in the British [[Empiricism|Empiricists]] (and even further in [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thought), it was Kant who introduced the terminology. The distinction concerns the relation of a subject to its predicate: analytic claims are those in which the subject contains the predicate, as in "All bodies are extended." Synthetic claims bring two concepts together, as in "All events are caused." The distinction was recently called into question by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]], in his paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]."

=== [[A priori and a posteriori|''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'']] ===
The origins of the distinction are less clear, and it concerns the origins of [[knowledge]]. ''A posteriori'' knowledge arises from, or is caused by, experience. ''A priori'' knowledge may come temporally after experience, but its certainty is not derivable from the experience itself. [[Saul Kripke]] was the first major think to propose that there are analytic ''a posteriori'' knowledge claims.

== Notable Distinctions in Historical Authors ==

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] makes the distinction between [[Potentiality and actuality|actuality and potentiality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Cohen|first=S. Marc|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actuality is a realization of the way a thing could be, while potency refers simply to the way a thing could be. There are two levels to each: matter itself can be anything, and becomes something actually by [[Four causes|causes]], making it something which then has the ability to be in a certain way, and that ability can then be realized. The matter of an ax can be an ax, then is made into an ax. The ax thereby is able to cut, and reaches a new form of actuality in actually cutting.

=== Aquinas ===
The major distinction [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] makes is that of [[essence]] and [[existence]]. It is a distinction already in [[Avicenna]], but Aquinas maps the distinction onto the actuality/potentiality distinction of Aristotle, such that the essence of a thing is in potency to the existence of a thing, which is that thing's actuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aq-meta/#H2|title=Aquinas: Metaphysics {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kant ===
In [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the distinction between appearance and thing-in-itself is foundational to his entire philosophical project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colin|first=Marshall,|title=Kant’s One Self and the Appearance/Thing-in-itself Distinction|url=https://www.academia.edu/2573493/Kants_one_self_and_the_appearance_thing-in-itself_distinction|journal=Kant-Studien|language=en|volume=104|issn=0022-8877}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction separates the way a thing appears to us on the one hand, and the way a thing really is.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5432">'''Endogenosymbiosis''' is an [[evolution]]ary process, proposed by the evolutionary and environmental biologist Roberto Cazzolla Gatti, in which "gene carriers" ([[virus]]es, [[retrovirus]]es and [[bacteriophage]]s) and symbiotic [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cells ([[bacteria]] or [[archaea]]) could share parts or all of their [[genome]]s in an endogenous symbiotic relationship with their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-10-endogenosymbiosis-hypothesis.html|title=Two new studies confirm the 'endogenosymbiosis' hypothesis |date=October 2016 |work=[[phys.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite biorxiv|last=Gatti |first=Roberto Cazzolla |date=2015 |title=A new idea on the evolution of biodiversity |biorxiv=019828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cazzolla Gatti |first=Roberto|date=2016-03-01|title=A conceptual model of new hypothesis on the evolution of biodiversity |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/biolog.2016.71.issue-3/biolog-2016-0032/biolog-2016-0032.xml?format=INT |journal=Biologia |volume=71 |issue=3 |doi=10.1515/biolog-2016-0032 |issn=1336-9563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==

The related process of [[symbiogenesis]] or endosymbiosis was proposed by [[Lynn Margulis]] in 1967. She argued that the internal symbiosis of bacteria-like organisms had formed organelles like [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. She proposed that this had created the [[eukaryote]]s, and thus driven the expansion of life on Earth. She had argued that this process of symbiotic collaboration had run alongside the classical [[Darwinian]] cycle of [[mutation]], [[natural selection]] and [[adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sagan, Lynn |year=1967 |title=On the origin of mitosing cells |journal=[[J Theor Biol]] |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=255–274 |pmid=11541392 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(67)90079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic symbiosis from parasites ==
Roberto Cazzolla Gatti, Ph.D., associate professor at [[Tomsk State University]] (Russia), argued in his hypothesis that "the main likely cause of the evolution of sexual reproduction, the [[parasitism]], also represents the origin of biodiversity". 
In other terms, this theory suggests that sexual reproduction acts as a conservative system against the inclusion of new genetic variations into cells' DNA (supported by the DNA repair systems) and, instead, the evolution of species can take place only when this preservative system fails to contrast the inclusion, within the host genome, of hexogen parts of DNA (and RNA) coming from obliged "parasitic" elements (viruses and phages) that establish a symbiosis with their hosts. 
"As two parallel evolutionary lines – Cazzolla Gatti wrote in his original paper – sexual reproduction seems to preserve what the endogenosymbiosis moves to diversify. Following the former process, the species can adapt slowly and indefinitely to the external factors, adjusting themselves, but not 'creating' novelty. The latter process, instead, leads to the speciation due to sudden changes in genes sequences. Not only organelles can be symbiotic with other cells, as suggested Lynn Margulis, but entire pieces of genetic material coming from symbiotic parasites, can be included in the host DNA, changing the gene expression and addressing the speciation process".

This idea challenges the canonical natural selection models based on the gradualism of the mutation-adaptation pattern, providing more support to the [[punctuated equilibrium theory]] proposed by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]].

== Evidence ==
Two independent studies provide support for the hypothesis. Jamie E. Henzy and Welkin E. Johnson demonstrated that the complex evolutionary history of the IFIT (Interferon Induced proteins with Tetratricopeptide repeats) family of antiviral genes has been shaped by continuous interactions between [[mammal]]ian hosts and their many viruses.&lt;ref&gt;Henzy, J. E., &amp; Johnson, W. E. 2016. Phylogenetic sleuthing reveals pair of paralogous genes. eLife, 5, e17224&lt;/ref&gt;

David Enard and colleagues estimated that viruses have driven close to 30% of all adaptive [[amino acid]] changes in the part of the human proteome conserved within mammals. Their results suggest that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change across mammalian and human proteomes.&lt;ref&gt;Enard, D., Cai, L., Gwennap, C., &amp; Petrov, D. A. 2016. Viruses are a dominant driver of protein adaptation in mammals. eLife, 5, e12469&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, it was estimated that about 7–8% percent of the entire human genome carry about 100,000 pieces of DNA that came from endogenous [[retrovirus]]es. This may be an underestimate.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 2016 the biologists Sarah R. Bordestein and Seth R. Bordestein reported that genes are frequently transferred between hosts and parasites. Eukaryotic genes are often co-opted by viruses and bacterial genes are commonly found in [[bacteriophage]]s. The presence of bacteriophages in symbiotic bacteria that obligately reside in eukaryotes may promote eukayotic DNA transfers to bacteriophages.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah R. Bordenstein &amp; Seth R. Bordenstein, Eukaryotic association module in phage WO genomes from Wolbachia, Nature Communications 7, Article number: 13155 (2016) doi:10.1038/ncomms13155&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Excess Noise Ratio is primarily used in connection with noise diodes which are a common method of measuring the noise performance of an [[amplifier]]. The measurement technique is described in detail in application notes such as Keysight Application note 57-2 "Noise Figure Measurement Accuracy - The Y-Factor method." By using a noise diode, the output noise of the amplifier is measured using two input noise levels (the Excess Noise Ratio) and by measuring the output noise factor (referred to as Y) the noise figure of the amplifier can be determined without having to measure the amplifier gain.

== Background ==
Any amplifier generates noise. In a radio receiver the first stage dominates the overall noise of the receiver and in most cases thermal, or Johnson noise, determines the overall noise performance of a receiver. As radio signals decrease in size the noise at the input of the receiver will determine a lower threshold of what can be received. The level of noise is determined by calculating the noise in a 50 ohm resistor at the input of the receiver as follows:

P&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt; = kTB

where:

k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38 x 10-23 joule / k

T= Temperature (Kelvin)

B = Bandwidth (Hz)

Thus it can be see that receivers with a narrow bandwidth have a higher sensitivity than receivers with a large bandwidth and that input noise can be decreased by putting the receiver input stage at a cold temperature.

A noise diode is a device which has a defined Excess Noise Ratio.

When the diode is off (unpowered) the noise from it will be thermal noise defined by the above formula. The bandwidth to be used is the bandwidth of the receiver.

When the diode is on (powered) the noise from it will be increased from the thermal noise by a figure called the "Excess Noise Ratio". This figure could be 6&amp;nbsp;dB for testing an amplifier with 40&amp;nbsp;dB gain and could be 16&amp;nbsp;dB for an amplifier with less gain or higher noise.

To determine the noise figure of an amplifier we use a noise diode at the input to the amplifier and determine the output noise "Y" with the diode switched on and off.

With knowledge of Y and a knowledge of ENR we can then determine the amount of noise contributed by the amplifier and hence we can calculate the noise figure of the amplifier.

Other techniques exist for making this measurement but either require accurate measurements of impedance or are inaccurate.

The following formula relates Y-factor to ENR:

&lt;math&gt; NF=10\log_{10}\frac{10^{(ENR/10)}}{10^{(Y/10)} -1}     &lt;/math&gt;

== Measurements ==

Noise figure measurements can be made with a noise diode, a power supply for the noise diode, and a spectrum analyser. They can also be made with a specialist noise figure meter. The advantage of the noise figure meter is that it will automatically switch the noise diode on and off, giving a continuous reading of Y; it will also have the correct bandwidths in its receiver to average the received noise in an optimum fashion. However, accurate noise figure measurements are possible with the noise figure meter and a spectrum analyser.

'''Failure bias''' is the [[logical error]] of concentrating on the people or things that failed to make it past some selection process and overlooking those that did, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of [[selection bias]].

In several of these cases, one measure of success is precisely the lack of [[public awareness]] of people or things that are undergoing such selection process, which means that, in the possibility that there is at least one agent who is interested in the success of the people or things that are going through the selection process, the agent(s) will be interested into keeping the subject out of the public eye, and thus, to raise the likelihood of the failure bias happening

A [[proposition|statement]], [[hypothesis]], or [[theory]] has '''falsifiability''' (or is  '''falsifiable''') if it is contradicted by a basic statement, which, in an eventual successful or failed falsification, must respectively correspond to a true or [[hypothetical]] observation.&lt;ref name="twomeanings"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1983|p=XXII}}: "We must distinguish two meanings of the expressions ''falsifiable'' and ''falsifiability'':&lt;br /&gt;
"1) ''Falsifiable'' as a logical-technical term, in the sense of the demarcation criterion of falsifiability. This purely logical concept — falsifiable in principle, one might say — rests on a logical relation between the theory in question and the class of basic statements (or the potential falsifiers described by them).&lt;br /&gt;
"2) ''Falsifiable'' in the sense that the theory in question can definitively or conclusively or demonstrably be falsified ("demonstrably falsifiable").&lt;br /&gt;
"I have always stressed that even a theory which is obviously falsifiable in the first sense is never falsifiable in this second sense. (For this reason I have used the expression ''falsifiable'' as a rule only in the first, technical sense. In the second sense, I have as a rule spoken not of ''falsifiability'' but rather of ''falsification'' and of its  problems)"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reproducibility"&gt;For an actual falsification to occur, the basic statement must be  [[Reproducibility|reproducible]]. See {{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=66}}: "We say that a theory is falsified only if we have accepted basic statements which contradict it (cf. section 11, rule 2). This condition is necessary, but not sufficient; for we have seen that non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science. Thus a few stray basic statements contradicting a theory will hardly induce us to reject it as falsified. We shall take it as falsified only if we discover a reproducible effect which refutes the theory. In other words, we only accept the falsification if a low-level empirical hypothesis which describes such an effect is proposed and corroborated. This kind of hypothesis may be called a falsifying hypothesis."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the claim "all swans are white" is falsifiable since it is contradicted by this basic statement: "In 1697, during the [[Willem de Vlamingh|Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh]] expedition, there were black swans on the shore of the Swan River in Australia", which in this case is a true observation.&lt;ref&gt;Back in those days it was assumed that everyone (in Europe) believed that swans had to be white {{harv|Life On Perth|2007}}, but this changed, because this basic statement is reproducible: swans can be seen at different times and locations.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="observation"&gt;Popper put as an example of falsifiable statement with failed falsifications  Einstein's [[equivalence principle]]. See {{harvnb|Popper|1983|p=XX}}: "Einstein's principle of proportionality of inert and (passively) heavy mass. This equivalence principle '''conflicts with many potential falsifiers: events whose observation is logically possible'''. Yet despite all attempts (the experiments by Eötvös, more recently refined by Rickle) to realize such a falsification experimentally, the experiments have so far corroborated the principle of equivalence."&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is also known by the terms '''refutable''' and '''refutability'''.

The concept was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]].   He saw falsifiability as the logical part and the cornerstone of his scientific [[epistemology]], which sets the limits of scientific inquiry.  He proposed that statements and theories that are not falsifiable are [[unscientific]].  Declaring an unfalsifiable theory to be [[scientific method|scientific]] would then be [[pseudoscience]].{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}

==Overview==
The classical view of the [[philosophy of science]] is that it is the goal of science to prove [[hypotheses]] like "All swans are white" or to [[inductive reasoning|induce]] them from observational data. The [[Inductive reasoning|Inductivist]] methodology supposes that one can somehow move from a series of statements such as 'here is a white swan', 'over there is a white swan', and so on, to a universal statement such as 'all swans are white'. As observed by  [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and later by Popper and others, this method is clearly ''deductively'' invalid, since it is always possible that there may be a non-white swan that has eluded observation&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Popper|1959|p=4}} : "Now it is far from obvious, from a logical point of view, that we are justified in inferring universal statements from singular ones, no matter how numerous; for any conclusion drawn in this way may always turn out to be false: no matter how many instances of white swans we may have observed, this does not justify the conclusion that all swans are white."&lt;/ref&gt; (and, in fact, the discovery of the Australian [[black swan]] demonstrated the deductive invalidity of this particular statement). This is known as the [[problem of induction]].

One solution to the problem of induction, proposed by Immanuel Kant in [[Critique of Pure Reason]], is to consider as valid absolutely [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] the conclusions that we would otherwise have drawn from these dubious inferential inductions.&lt;ref&gt;In {{harvnb|Kant|1787|loc=sec II, B4}}: "If, therefore, a judgment is thought with strict universality, i.e., so that no exception at all is allowed to be possible, then it is not derived from experience, but is valid absolutely a priori."&lt;/ref&gt; Following Kant, Popper accepted that we have to work with unproven hypotheses, but he refused that we have to justify them in any way&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=9}}: "According to the view that will be put forward here, the method of critically testing theories, and selecting them according to the results of tests, always proceeds on the following lines. From a new idea, put up tentatively, and not yet justified in any way—an anticipation, a hypothesis, a theoretical system, or what you will—conclusions are drawn by means of logical deduction. These conclusions are then compared with one another and with other relevant statements, so as to find what logical relations (such as equivalence, derivability, compatiblity, or incompatibility) exist between them."&lt;/ref&gt; and he wrote {{harv|Popper|1959|p=6}}: "I do not think that his ingenious attempt to provide an a priori justification for synthetic statements was successful." However, if one finds one single swan that is not white, deductive logic admits the conclusion that the statement that all swans are white is false. Falsificationism thus strives for questioning, for falsification, of hypotheses instead of proving them or trying to view them as valid in any way.

For a statement to be questioned using observation, it needs to be at least theoretically possible that it can come into conflict with observation. A key observation of falsificationism is thus that a criterion of demarcation is needed to distinguish those statements that can come into conflict with observation and those that cannot, but the criterion itself concerns only the logical form of the theory: 

{{Quote|text=I shall require that [the] logical form [of the theory] shall be such that it can be singled out, by means of empirical tests, in a negative sense: it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience.|sign=Karl Popper|source=[[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p 19}}

Popper always insisted on a clear distinction between the logic (of falsifiability) and its applied less precise methodology.&lt;ref |group=notes&gt;{{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc=Sec. 3}}: "Popper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of falsifiability and its applied methodology."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref |group=notes&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|loc=section 23, 1er paragraphe}} : "The requirement of falsifiability which was a little vague to start with has now been split into two parts. The first, the methodological postulate (cf. section 20), can hardly be made quite precise. The second, the logical criterion, is quite definite as soon as it is clear which statements are to be called ‘basic’."&lt;/ref&gt; The required logical form, the criterion,  is that there must exist basic statements that contradict the theory (and also some that corroborate it because the theory must be consistent). This logical form informally implies the possibility of refutations by experience because, in its informal methodological context, a basic statement must be intersubjective and interpretable in terms of observations.

Objections can be raised against falsifiability as a criterion of demarcation similar to those which can be raised against [[Formal verification|verifiability]].  For example, as pointed out by many{{sfn|Miller|2014|p=4}} and reformulated by Colin McGinn, 
{{quote|text=[w]e have to be able to infer that if a falsifying result has been found in a given experiment it will be found in future experiments; ... this is clearly an inductive inference.|author=Colin McGinn|source={{harvnb|McGinn|2002|loc=sec. 3}}}}

Very early, in anticipation of this specific objection Popper wrote,  
{{Quote|text=This attack would not disturb me.  My proposal is based upon an ''asymmetry'' between verifiability and falsifiability; an asymmetry which results from the logical form of universal statements. For these are never derivable from singular statements, but can be contradicted by singular statements.|sign=Karl Popper|source=[[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p 19}}

In its simple form, the point here is that although a singular existential statement such as 'there is a white swan in Europe' cannot be used to affirm a universal statement, it can be used to show that one is false: the statement 'there is a non white swan in Australia' implies that the universal statement 'all swans are white' is false. Moreover, this singular existential statement is empirical: it is impractical to observe all the swans in the world to verify that they are all white, but one can observe one swan that is not white.  This shows the fundamental difference between verifiability and falsifiability. Also, in the logical form of the theory, there is no notion of future experiments, but only a (formal) class of basic statements that contradict it.&lt;ref name="reproducibility" /&gt;&lt;ref name="empiricalisalogicalrequirement"/&gt;

Such a simple contradiction with a basic statement is not what Popper calls a falsification.&lt;ref name="falsifiabilityVsfalsification"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=66|loc=sec. 22}}: "We must clearly distinguish between falsifiability and falsification. We have introduced falsifiability solely as a criterion for the empirical character of a system of statements. As to falsification, special rules must be introduced which will determine under what conditions a
system is to be regarded as falsified."&lt;/ref&gt; A falsification usually entails a derivation from a system of statements, which include the universal statement and initial conditions, to a singular statement, which is contradicted by a falsifying hypothesis,&lt;ref name="reproducibility"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Popper|1959|p=55}}: "We may distinguish, within a theoretical system, statements belonging to various levels of universality. The statements on the highest level of universality are the axioms; statements on the lower levels can be deduced from them. Higher level empirical statements have always the character of hypotheses relative to the lower level statements deducible from them: they can be falsified by the falsification of these less universal statements. ... The falsifying mode of inference here referred to—the way in which the falsification of a conclusion entails the falsification of the system from which it is derived—is the modus tollens of classical logic. It may be described as follows:  Let p be a conclusion of a system t of statements which may consist of theories and initial conditions ..."&lt;/ref&gt; but the argument can be generalized. Popper explains 
{{quote|text="... it is possible by means of purely deductive inferences (with the help of the modus tollens of classical logic) to argue from the truth of singular statements to the falsity of universal statements. Such an argument to the falsity of universal statements is the only strictly deductive kind of inference that proceeds, as it were, in the ‘inductive direction’; that is, from singular to universal statements."|author=Karl Popper|source={{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=19}}}}   Contemporary philosopher [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] mentions{{sfn|Miller|2014|p=4}} that other similar objections have been anticipated and answered by Popper.{{sfn|Popper|1972|loc=Chapter 1}}

The falsifiability criterion does not imply that unfalsifiable systems such as logic, mathematics and metaphysics are not parts of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: "For Popper, however, to assert that a theory is unscientific, is not necessarily to hold that it is unenlightening, still less that it is meaningless, for it sometimes happens that a theory which is unscientific (because it is unfalsifiable) at a given time may become falsifiable, and thus scientific, with the development of technology, or with the further articulation and refinement of the theory. Further, even purely mythogenic explanations have performed a valuable function in the past in expediting our understanding of the nature of reality."&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to intuition, unfalsifiable statements can be embedded in—and [[logical consequence|deductively entailed]] by—falsifiable theories. For example, while "all men are mortal" is unfalsifiable, it is a [[logical consequence]] of the falsifiable theory that "all men die 150 years after their birth at the latest".{{sfn|Keuth|2004|p=45}} Similarly, the ancient metaphysical and unfalsifiable idea of the existence of atoms has led to corresponding falsifiable modern theories. Popper invented the notion of [[metaphysical]] research programs to name such unfalsifiable ideas that guide the search for a new theory.{{sfn|Popper|1982|loc=Introductory comments}}

Thus falsificationism has two levels. At the logical level, scientists use deductive logic to attempt to falsify theories. At the non-logical level, they decide on some criteria, which use falsification and other factors, to pick which theories they will study, improve, replace, apply or (further) test. These other criteria may take into account a metaphysical research program. They are not considered in the formal falsifiability criterion, but they can give a meaning to this criterion. Needless to say, for Popper, these other criteria, the so called rules of the game, are necessary. Some philosophers consider them  as parts of Popper's demarcation criterion, but Popper viewed them only as a necessary context.

In contrast to [[Positivism]], which held that statements are meaningless if they cannot be verified or falsified, Popper claimed that falsifiability is merely a special case of the more general notion of [[critical rationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1963|p=26}}: "The proper answer to my question 'How can we hope to detect and eliminate error?' is, I believe, 'By criticizing the theories or guesses of others and--if we can train ourselves to do so--by criticizing our own theories or guesses.' (The latter point is highly desirable, but not indispensable; for if we fail to criticize our own theories, there may be others to do it for us.) This answer sums up a position which I propose to call 'critical rationalism'."&lt;/ref&gt; even though he admitted that empirical refutation is one of the most effective methods by which theories can be criticized. Criticizability, in contrast to falsifiability, and thus rationality, may be comprehensive (i.e., have no logical limits), though this claim is controversial, even among proponents of Popper's philosophy and critical rationalism.

==Definition==
For Popper (and others) in any scientific discussion we accept a background knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1963|p=238}}: While discussing a problem we always accept (if only temporarily) all kinds of things as unproblematic: they constitute for the time being, and for the discussion of this particular problem, what I call our background knowledge."&lt;/ref&gt; Such a background knowledge is thus implicit in the definition of falsifiability and corresponds to different types of statements, their relationship&lt;ref name="twomeanings"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1983|p=XXII}}: "We must distinguish two meanings of the expressions ''falsifiable'' and ''falsifiability'':&lt;br /&gt;
"1) ''Falsifiable'' as a logical-technical term, in the sense of the demarcation criterion of falsifiability. This purely logical concept — falsifiable in principle, one might say — rests on a logical relation between the theory in question and the class of basic statements (or the potential falsifiers described by them).&lt;br /&gt;
"2) ''Falsifiable'' in the sense that the theory in question can definitively or conclusively or demonstrably be falsified ("demonstrably falsifiable").&lt;br /&gt;
"I have always stressed that even a theory which is obviously falsifiable in the first sense is never falsifiable in this second sense. (For this reason I have used the expression ''falsifiable'' as a rule only in the first, technical sense. In the second sense, I have as a rule spoken not of ''falsifiability'' but rather of ''falsification'' and of its  problems)"&lt;/ref&gt; and their interpretation in terms of observations and measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=84}}: "... that is to say, basic statements must be testable, inter-subjectively, by ‘observation’. Since they are singular statements, this requirement can of course only refer to observers who are suitably placed in space and time (a point which I shall not elaborate)."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Different types of statements===
Recall that a theory is falsifiable if it is contradicted by a basic statement. It remains to define what kind of statements create theories and what are basic statements. [[Physical law|Scientific theories]]  are a particular kind of [[universal quantification|universal statements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=37}}: " The empirical sciences are systems of theories. The logic of scientific knowledge can therefore be described as a theory of theories.  Scientific theories are universal statements."&lt;/ref&gt; Basic statements are particular kind of [[existential quantification|existential statements]].&lt;ref name="basicstatements"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=83–84}}: "A statement of the form ‘There is a so-and-so in the region k’ or ‘Such-and-such an event is occurring in the region k’ (cf. section 23) may be called a ‘singular existential statement’ or a ‘singular there-is statement’. And the statement which results from negating it, i.e. ‘There is no so-and-so in the region k’ or ‘No event of such-and-such a kind is occurring in the region k’, may be called a ‘singular non-existence statement’, or a ‘singular there-is-not statement’.  We may now lay down the following rule concerning basic statements: basic statements have the form of singular existential statements."&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all universal statements are theories and not all existential statements are basic statements. Theories have the form of '''strictly''' universal statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=48}}: "The theories of natural science, and especially what we call natural laws, have the logical form of strictly universal statements; thus they can be expressed in the form of negations of strictly existential statements or, as we may say, in the form of non-existence statements (or ‘there-is-not’ statements). For example, the law of the conservation of energy can be expressed in the form: ‘There is no perpetual motion machine’, or the hypothesis of the electrical elementary charge in the form: ‘There is no electrical charge other than a multiple of the electrical elementary charge’."&lt;/ref&gt; Basic statements have the form of [[wiktionary:singular existential statement|'''singular''' existential statements]].&lt;ref name="basicstatements" /&gt; Thus we need to distinguish between  existential and universal statements and also between singular  and strict  statements.

Existential and universal statements are built-in concepts in [[First-order logic|logic]]. The first are statements  such as "there is a white swan".  Logicians call these statements [[existential quantification|existential statements]], since they assert the existence of something.  They are equivalent to a first-order logic statement of the form: ''There exists an x such that x is a swan, and x is white.'' The second are statements that categorize all instances of something, such as "all swans are white". Logicians call these statements [[universal quantification|universal]]. They are usually parsed in the form: ''For all x, if x is a swan, then x is white''.

Unlike existential and universal statements, singular and strict statements are not built-in concepts in logic, because they correspond to a specific perspective on our experience of the world.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=42}}  We can understand them in terms of the concepts of universal or individual names: {{quote |text="... ‘dictator’, ‘planet’, ‘H2O’ are universal concepts or universal names. ‘Napoleon’, ‘the earth’, ‘the Atlantic’ are singular or individual concepts or names. In these examples individual concepts or names appear to be characterized either by being proper names, or by having to be defined by means of proper names, whilst universal concepts or names can be defined without the use of proper names."|author=Karl Popper|source={{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=42–43}}}}

A statement is strict or pure, if it does not use any individual name. So, a law of nature cannot refer to particular things. The sentence "This apple is attracted by the planet earth" is not a scientific statement. Popper wrote an entire section on strictly universal and strictly existential statements,{{sfn|Popper|1959|pp=47-50}} because he considers the distinction between universal and individual concepts
or names to be of fundamental importance.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=43}}

A statement is singular if it contains an individual name or the equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;This is Popper's definition. There is no well established definition of ''singular statement'', ''singular sentence'' or ''singular proposition''. For example,  Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy says that it is a sentence without variables, free or bound. This is also the definition adopted by Alfred Tarski in ''Introduction to logic and to the methodology of deductive sciences''. However, in the debate between Fregeans and Russellians in the philosophy of language, the definition is more restrictive: a singular sentence means a sentence with a single subject that respects a property such as "Mont Blanc is more than 4000 meters high" - see "Singular Propositions and
Singular Thoughts" by Arthur Sullivan.&lt;/ref&gt;   So, a basic statement must make reference to a specific thing or specific location and time. The sentence "There exists a black swan" is not a basic statement, but the statement "There is a black swan on the shore of the Swan River" is a basic statement, it is a singular existential statement.

Popper arrived at these conditions through an analysis of what one expects from basic statements.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=83}}  In addition, a basic statement must be inter-subjective.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=84}} So, "John saw a  black swan on the shore of the Swan River" is not a basic statement.&lt;ref&gt;Unless, of course, the theory is about people seeing black swans, in which case, we view John as a thing, just as the shore is a thing.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodological rules and falsifying hypotheses===
Falsifiability is defined strictly in terms of the logical form of the theory,&lt;ref name="twomeanings" /&gt; but this criterion of demarcation can not work without being complemented by methodological rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=28–29}}: "If therefore we characterize empirical science merely by the formal or logical structure of its statements, we shall not be able to exclude from it that prevalent form of metaphysics which results from elevating an obsolete scientific theory into an incontrovertible truth. Such are my reasons for proposing that empirical science should be characterized by its methods: by our manner of dealing with scientific systems: by what we do with them and what we do to them. Thus I shall try to establish the rules, or if you will the norms, by which the scientist is guided when he is engaged in research or in discovery, in the sense here understood."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, contemporary philosophers consider that Popper's demarcation criterion has two parts: the logical part (stated in terms of rules of inference - ways to logically infer new statements from existing statements) and the methodological part (stated in terms of rules that do not claim to prove anything).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 3}}: "Popper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of falsifiability and its applied methodology. The logic of his theory is utterly simple: if a single ferrous metal is unaffected by a magnetic field it cannot be the case that all ferrous metals are affected by magnetic fields. Logically speaking, a scientific law is conclusively falsifiable although it is not conclusively verifiable. Methodologically, however, the situation is much more complex: no observation is free from the possibility of error—consequently we may question whether our experimental result was what it appeared to be."&lt;/ref&gt;  The methodological rules define falsification. They should not be confused with the (logical) rules of inferences used to define falsifiability, which is about the logical form of the theory.&lt;ref name="falsifiabilityVsfalsification"/&gt;

In this larger picture, the fact that a single basic statement can contradict a strictly universal statement, though true logically, is in itself useless, because it cannot lead to a falsification. To support falsification, Popper requires that a class of basic statements corroborate a falsifying hypothesis.&lt;ref name="reproducibility"/&gt; A  basic statement corroborates the falsifying hypothesis, if it does not logically contradict it, but contradicts the theory to be falsified. Though it corresponds to the empirical notion of reproducible experiments, this requirement exists entirely at the formal level&lt;ref name="empiricalisalogicalrequirement"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=66–67}}: "The requirement that the falsifying hypothesis must be empirical, and so falsifiable, only means that it must stand in a certain logical relationship to possible basic statements; thus this requirement only concerns the logical form of the hypothesis."&lt;/ref&gt; and must be complemented by methodological rules in a falsification process.

==Naïve falsification{{anchor|Naïve|Na.C3.AFve}}==&lt;!-- see [[Karl Popper]] --&gt;

Naïve falsificationism is an unsuccessful attempt to prescribe a rationally unavoidable method for science. Sophisticated methodological falsification, on the other hand, is a prescription of a way in which scientists ought to behave as a matter of choice. The object of this is to arrive at an incremental process whereby theories become ''less bad''.{{Citation needed|reason=We don't even know what naive falsification means here|date=June 2018}}

Naïve falsification considers scientific statements individually. Scientific theories are formed from groups of these sorts of statements, and it is these groups that must be accepted or rejected by scientists. Scientific theories can always be defended by the addition of [[ad hoc hypothesis|''ad hoc'' hypotheses]].{{Citation needed|reason=The two previous sentences are not connected - what is the point?|date=June 2018}}  As Popper put it, a ''decision'' is required on the part of the scientist to accept or reject the statements that go to make up a theory or that might falsify it. At some point, the weight of the ''ad hoc'' hypotheses and disregarded falsifying observations will become so great that it becomes unreasonable to support the base theory any longer, and a decision will be made to reject it.{{Citation needed|reason=Where Popper says that|date=June 2018}}

Although the logic of naïve falsification is valid, it is rather limited. Nearly any statement can be made to fit the data, so long as one makes the requisite 'compensatory adjustments'. Popper drew attention to these limitations in ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' in response to criticism from [[Pierre Duhem]]. [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] expounded this argument in detail, calling it [[confirmation holism]]. To logically falsify a [[universality (philosophy)|universal]], one must find a true falsifying singular statement. But Popper pointed out that it is always possible to ''change'' the universal statement or the existential statement so that falsification does not occur.&lt;ref&gt;[[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: "It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least."&lt;/ref&gt; On hearing that a black swan has been observed in Australia, one might introduce the ''[[ad hoc]]'' hypothesis, 'all swans are white except those found in Australia'; or one might adopt another, more cynical view about some observers, 'Australian [[ornithology|bird watchers]] are incompetent'.

Thus, naïve falsification ought to, but does not, supply a way of handling competing hypotheses for many subject controversies (for instance [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] and [[urban legends]]). People arguing that there is no support for such an observation may argue that there is nothing to see, that all is normal, or that the differences or appearances are too small to be statistically significant.  On the other side are those who concede that an observation has occurred and that a universal statement has been falsified as a consequence.  Therefore, naïve falsification does not enable scientists, who rely on [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] criteria, to present a definitive falsification of universal statements.{{Citation needed|reason=Who says that|date=June 2018}}

==Falsificationism==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}

In place of naïve falsification, Popper envisioned science as progressing by the successive rejection of falsified theories, rather than falsified statements.  Falsified theories are to be replaced by theories that can account for the [[phenomena]] that falsified the prior theory, that is, with greater [[explanatory power]]. For example, [[Aristotle|Aristotelian mechanics]] explained observations of everyday situations, but were falsified by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s experiments, and were replaced by Newtonian mechanics, which accounted for the phenomena noted by Galileo (and others). [[Newtonian mechanics]]' reach included the observed motion of the planets and the mechanics of gases. The Youngian wave theory of light (i.e., waves carried by the [[luminiferous aether]]) replaced Newton's (and many of the Classical Greeks') particles of light but in turn was falsified by the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] and was superseded by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s electrodynamics and Einstein's [[special relativity]], which did account for the newly observed phenomena. Furthermore, Newtonian mechanics applied to the atomic scale was replaced with [[quantum mechanics]], when the old theory could not provide an answer to the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], the [[Gibbs paradox]], or how [[Atomic orbital|electron orbits]] could exist without the particles radiating away their energy and spiraling towards the centre. Thus the new theory had to posit the existence of unintuitive concepts such as [[energy levels]], [[quantum|quanta]] and [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]].

At each stage, experimental observation made a theory untenable (i.e., falsified it) and a new theory was found that had greater ''explanatory power'' (i.e., could account for the previously unexplained phenomena), and as a result, ''provided greater opportunity for its own falsification''.

==Criterion of demarcation==
Popper uses falsification as a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]] to draw a sharp line between those theories that are scientific and those that are unscientific.  It is useful to know if a statement or theory is falsifiable, if for no other reason than that it provides us with an understanding of the ways in which one might assess the theory. One might at the least be saved from attempting to falsify a non-falsifiable theory, or come to see an unfalsifiable theory as unsupportable. Popper claimed that, if a theory is falsifiable, then it is scientific.

The Popperian criterion excludes from the domain of science not unfalsifiable ''statements'' but only ''whole theories'' that ''contain no'' falsifiable statements; thus it leaves us with the [[confirmation holism|Duhemian]] problem of what constitutes a 'whole theory' as well as the problem of what makes a statement 'meaningful'.  Popper's own falsificationism, thus, is not only an alternative to verificationism, it is also an acknowledgement of the conceptual distinction that previous theories had ignored.

===Verificationism===
{{Main|Verificationist}}
{{See also|Abductive reasoning}}

In the [[philosophy of science]], verificationism (also known as the verifiability theory of meaning) holds that a statement must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be both meaningful and scientific.
This was an essential feature of the [[logical positivism]] of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]] that included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], the Berlin philosopher [[Hans Reichenbach]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both. In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a criterion of demarcation.

Thus, Popper urged that verifiability be replaced with falsifiability as the criterion of demarcation. On the other hand, he strictly opposed the view that non-falsifiable statements are meaningless or otherwise inherently bad, and noted that falsificationism is only  concerned with meaningful statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=18|loc=footnote 3}}: "Falsifiability separates two kinds of perfectly meaningful statements: the falsifiable and the non-falsifiable. It draws a line inside meaningful language, not around it."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in courts of law===
Falsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases (see below). A survey of 303 federal judges&lt;ref&gt;Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N = 619). Only 303 usable surveys were
obtained for a response rate of 51% (see {{harvnb|Krafka|2002}}).&lt;/ref&gt; conducted in 1998 (and fully reported in {{harvnb|Krafka|2002}}) revealed that  "[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert’s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases."

==== The McLean v. Arkansas case ====
In the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that "[[creation science]]" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):
* It is guided by natural law; 
* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law;  
* It is testable against the empirical world; 
* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and 
* It is falsifiable. 
In his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}

==== The Daubert case ====
In the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.&lt;ref&gt;The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.&lt;/ref&gt;  These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested. ''Scientific methodology today is based on generating hypotheses and testing them to see if they can be falsified; indeed, this methodology is what distinguishes science from other fields of human inquiry.'' Green 645. See also C. Hempel, Philosophy of Natural Science 49 (1966) (''[T]he statements constituting a scientific explanation must be capable of empirical test''); K. Popper, Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge 37 (5th ed. 1989) (''[T]he criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability, or refutability, or testability'') (emphasis deleted).|author=Harry Blackmun|source={{harvnb|Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|1993|p=593}}}}

In a partially dissident opinion, Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]]  supported by Associate Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], responded that: {{Quote| text=I defer to no one in my confidence in federal judges; but I am at a loss to know what is meant when it is said that the scientific status of a theory depends on its ''falsifiability,'' and I suspect some of them will be, too.|author = William Rehnquist|source= {{harvnb|Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|1993|p=600}}}}

Professor of Law David H. Kaye&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with [[David Kaye (law professor)]], United Nations special rapporteur. David H. Kaye is distinguished professor of law at [[Penn State Law]].&lt;/ref&gt; argued that references to the Daubert majority opinion confused falsifiability and falsification and that "inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaye|2005|p=2}}: "... several courts have treated the abstract possibility of falsification as sufficient to satisfy this aspect of the screening of scientific evidence. This essay challenges these views. It first explains the distinct meanings of falsification and falsifiability. It then argues that while the Court did not embrace the views of any specific philosopher of science, inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations. Consequently, it concludes that recent opinions substituting mere falsifiability for actual empirical testing are misconstruing and misapplying Daubert."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unfalsifiable statistics/double evidence standards combo==
There are combinations of prediction types and methodologies that, while each component is compatible with falsifiability on its own, renders falsification impossible together. One example is the combination of statistical predictions in which individual exceptions do not falsify the theory with different evidence standards for different data points in which one type of data point only require ordinary evidence while another require extraordinary evidence. On one hand, the theory that there are no black swans is falsifiable even if there is a requirement of extraordinary evidence for a black swan, since it is not impossible for an individual observation of a black swan to eventually meet the requirement of extraordinary evidence. On the other hand, in a country where there are in reality the same number of black swans as white swans, the theory that there are more white swans than black swans at a population level with individual exceptions is falsifiable as long as the level of evidence required to record a white swan is the same as that for recording black swans. But if the theory is that white swans are more statistically common than black swans with exceptions and a higher level of evidence is required for recording a black swan than for recording a white swan, the difference in evidence standards will cause more white swans than black swans to be recorded even in a country where the ratio is in fact 50/50. This makes the combination of statistical prediction with exceptions and differences in evidence standards incompatible with falsifiability. This have been implicated in the [[replication crisis]], especially in [[psychology]] in which the two methodologies are more common than in other fields and therefore more often combine to prevent falsifiability even though the two factos are not unheard of on their own in other fields, as well as the problem being caused by active application of methodologies and therefore spreading the issues to other fields that psychology interacts with through interdisciplines such as [[evolutionary psychology]] spreading the problems to evolution research, and not allowing the other fields to help falsifiability in psychology as would have been possible had the problem been a passive lack of components for falsifiability.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defence | David Miller, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Vast Graveyard of Undead Theories: Publication Bias and Psychological Science’s Aversion to the Null | Christopher J.

==Criticisms==
===Contemporary philosophers===

Several contemporary [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] and [[Analytic Philosophy|analytic philosophers]] are strongly [[Karl Popper#Criticism|critical]] of Popper's philosophy of science.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gardner (2001), [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/gardner_popper.html "A Skeptical Look at Karl Popper,"] ''Skeptical Inquirer'', 25(4): 13–14, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=The cited article is only a personal rant of Martin Gardner against Popper. Given that, in addition, Gardner is known for his peculiar views on the philosophy of mathematics, it does not exemplify well the claim. |date=June 2018}} Popper's [[Inductive reasoning#Criticism|mistrust]] of [[inductive reasoning]] has led to claims that he misrepresents scientific practice.

{{quote|Sir Karl Popper is not really a participant in the contemporary professional philosophical dialogue; quite the contrary, he has ruined that dialogue.

Following his teacher, Karl Popper, the operating principle of Bartley's rationalism is the formula 'I may he wrong and you may be right, and by means of critical discussion we may get nearer to the truth of the matter'.  This simple principle of rationality requires philosophical defence in depth, backed up by a wide range of improved traditions and institutions to sustain the flow of ideas and critical discussion. These vehicles already exist of course, if only in rudimentary forms, among them talk-back radio, the range of serious 'little magazines' and programs on TV which allow opposing points of view to he explored and debated. These forums are vitally important despite all their imperfections and lapses into the trivial and the banal; the important thing is that they exist, not that they should be scrupulously fair and unbiased at all times nor that they confine themselves to matters of great moral and intellectual moment.  Bartley has provided philosophical air support for the footsoldiers of rationality.  He offers a solution to the basic logical problem of rationality, namely how can we justify the basic premise of rationality, that is, the principle of rationality itself, the principle that we should engage in critical discussion to seek for rationally defensible beliefs?}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Kuhn and Lakatos===
Whereas Popper was concerned in the main with the ''logic'' of science, [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]]'s influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' examined in detail the [[history of science]]. Kuhn argued that scientists work within a conceptual [[paradigm]] that strongly influences the way in which they see data. Scientists will go to great length to defend their paradigm against falsification, by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses to existing theories. Changing a 'paradigm' is difficult, as it requires an individual scientist to break with his or her peers and defend a heterodox theory.

Some falsificationists saw Kuhn's work as a vindication, since it provided historical evidence that science progressed by rejecting inadequate theories, and that it is the ''decision'', on the part of the scientist, to accept or reject a theory that is the crucial element of falsificationism. Foremost amongst these was [[Imre Lakatos]].

Lakatos attempted to explain Kuhn's work by arguing that science progresses by the falsification of ''research programs'' rather than the more specific universal statements of naïve falsification. In Lakatos' approach, a scientist works within a research program that corresponds roughly with Kuhn's 'paradigm'. Whereas Popper rejected the use of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses as unscientific, Lakatos accepted their place in the development of new theories.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978}}

===Feyerabend===
[[Paul Feyerabend]] examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method. Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Sokal and Bricmont===
In their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticized falsifiability on the grounds that it does not accurately describe the way science really works. They argue that theories are used because of their successes, not because of the failures of other theories. Their discussion of Popper, falsifiability and the philosophy of science comes in a chapter entitled "Intermezzo," which contains an attempt to make clear their own views of what constitutes truth, in contrast with the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.

Sokal and Bricmont write, "When a theory successfully withstands an attempt at falsification, a scientist will, quite naturally, consider the theory to be partially confirmed and will accord it a greater likelihood or a higher subjective probability. ... But Popper will have none of this: throughout his life he was a stubborn opponent of any idea of 'confirmation' of a theory, or even of its 'probability'. ... [but] the history of science teaches us that scientific theories come to be accepted above all because of their successes." (Sokal and Bricmont 1997, 62f)

They further argue that falsifiability cannot distinguish between astrology and astronomy, as both make technical predictions that are sometimes incorrect.

[[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]], a contemporary philosopher of critical rationalism, has attempted to defend Popper against these claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=David|title=Sokal and Bricmont: Back to the Frying Pan|journal=Pli|volume=9|year=2000|pages=156–73|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/staff/miller/miller_pli_9.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003401/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/staff/miller/miller_pli_9.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}, also chapter 6 of {{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=David|title=Out of Error|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller argues that astrology does not lay itself open to falsification, while astronomy does, and this is the litmus test for science.

===Economics===
[[Karl Popper]] argued that [[Marxism]] shifted from falsifiable to unfalsifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: "For Marxism, Popper believed, had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/methodological-individualism/ Methodological Individualism at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mises_Action"&gt;Ludwig von Mises.

===Young-earth creationism===
{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}

Much of the criticism against [[young-Earth creationism]] is based on evidence in nature that the Earth is much older than adherents believe.  Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.

===Historicism===
Theories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper "fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history"&lt;ref name="popperc"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,&lt;ref name="popperc" /&gt;  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.

===Mathematics===
Like all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]]. [[Albert Einstein]] wrote, "One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Albert Einstein |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=Sidelights on relativity |chapter=Geometry and Experience |page=27 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1923}} Reprinted by Dover (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-486-24511-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Food for the Hungry''' (also known as FH) is an international relief and development organization with operations in more than 20 countries. Food for the Hungry was founded in 1971 by Dr. Larry Ward.&lt;ref name="ECFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfa.org/MemberProfile.aspx?ID=5160 |title=Food for the Hungry (Accredited Organization Profile) |publisher=ECFA.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food for the Hungry's stated mission is "to walk with leaders, churches and families in overcoming all forms of human poverty by living in healthy relationship with [[God]] and His creation"&lt;ref name="Vision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/about/vision |title=About &amp;#124; Vision and Mission &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which was taken from [[Book of Psalms]] 146:7 He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. Food for the Hungry is a charter member of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]], since February 1, 1980.&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt;

== History ==
Larry Ward founded the organization in 1971, with offices in [[Southern California]]. He moved the offices to [[Arizona]] in 1974. Early projects included helping [[refugees]] in war-torn [[Bangladesh]], victims of the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake]], rescuing Vietnamese "[[boat people]]" from the [[South China Sea]], and helping hungry and needy people in [[Haiti]] and West Africa. The child sponsorship program was started in 1978. Hunger Corps, the people-sending division of Food for the Hungry, began in 1979.

Dr. Larry Ward retired as president of both the U.S. fundraising office and the international implementation arm of Food for the Hungry in 1984. He was succeeded by [[Ted Yamamori]], Ph.D. As a young child, Yamamori had his own near-starvation experience at the end of [[World War II]] in [[Japan]]. He survived, thanks to the kindness of strangers. Dr. Yamamori retired in 2001, at which point two people were hired to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/feeding-the-hungry|title=Feeding the Hungry Dr. Tetsunao Yamamori &amp; Food for the Hungry|publisher=Mission Frontiers|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Randall Hoag was appointed president of Food for the Hungry International, and Benjamin K. Homan was appointed president of Food for the Hungry/U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/food-for-the-hungry-phoenix-officials-assess-relief-programs-in-indonesia-15685/ |title=Food For The Hungry, Phoenix Officials Assess Relief Programs in Indonesia |publisher=Global.christianpost.com |date=2005-05-18 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, FH has consolidated its U.S. and international operations, led by President/CEO Gary Edmonds.

=== Evolution of FH's work ===
When Larry Ward founded FH, it was the result of his hurting heart for the 12,000 children who were then dying of hunger related causes.&lt;ref name="Policy Innovations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/innovations/data/food_hungry |title=The Food for the Hungry Story |publisher=Policyinnovations.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant relief theory of the day was that poverty was caused by a lack of resources, so providing resources was the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://askquestions.tv/category/speakers/keith-wright/ |title=Keith Wright - Redux |publisher=Askquestions.tv |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward left his position as executive vice president and overseas director at [[World Vision]] in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/world-vision-international-inc |title=World Vision International, Inc.: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and headed out to help impoverished people by taking to Haiti resources he had purchased with his personal credit card.&lt;ref name="Policy Innovations" /&gt;

FH's first official response was to help returnees of war in the newly forming nation of [[Bangladesh]] (formerly [[East Pakistan]]) in 1971. The focus on relief operations continued into the late 1970s, although many of those countries became areas where FH helped the people recover through long-term development projects.

'''Disaster Responses that became Development Areas in 1970s'''

{| class="wikitable sortable"

|-
| 1976 || Guatemala || Earthquake victims
|-
| 1978 || Philippines || Refugees of war
|-
| 1979 || Dominican Republic || Hurricane victims
|}

Beginning in 1978, FH began to more intentionally increase its development work. This is when FH first began working in countries without first responding to a humanitarian disaster, through its [[child sponsorship]] program. The child sponsorship&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt; program was launched in 1978 in [[Bolivia]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Philippines]]. Additional fields that were added in the 1980s included [[Peru]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Uganda]].

|-
| FH Ethiopia || [[Drought]] victims
|-
| FHDR || Haiti border
|-
| FH Mozambique || Civil war victims
|-
| FH Uganda || AIDS &amp; Civil war victims
|}

Throughout the early 1990s, a greater emphasis on the community began to emerge as the focus for development. At the same time, conflicts such as [[terrorism]], [[genocide]] and communist rebel activity were on the rise. FH developed a concise set of development principles focused on transforming communities by working closely with the churches, leaders and families. Over time, new and existing areas of operation would increasingly focus on addressing the whole of the community as an essential approach to serving the most vulnerable. Several fields of operation were added in the 1990s under this principle.

The first ten years of the 21st century would prove to be challenging yet provide new opportunities to adapt to developing global realities. Challenges came through several major emergencies that were added to the ongoing issues of hunger, poverty, HIV/AIDS and war.&lt;ref name="Fex profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fex.ennonline.net/5/agencyprofile |title=Food for the Hungry &amp;#124; ENN |publisher=Fex.ennonline.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Beginning in 1997 FH began implementing the innovative model of Cascade Groups into their developmental structure and programming. They have since been considered a leader and expert in the facilitation of these groups through their diligence and successful execution.

Cascade Groups uses of the idea of [[social networking]] to work in communities. Within this model, groups of 10-15 community-based [[volunteering|volunteers]] educate their neighbors about health issues. The volunteer educators regularly meet together with FH staff for training and supervision. Each of the volunteers meets regularly with 10-15 of her neighbors to share what she has learned and to facilitate behavior change at the household level. This not only creates a multiplying effect, but it also provides the structure for a community health information system that reports on new pregnancies, births and deaths.

Since the Cascade Group model was first pioneered, it has been used by 20 (and counting) other Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) in more than 20 countries, largely through the support of the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]]. In particular, the USAID Child Survival and Health Grants Program and the USAID [[Food for Peace]] (Title II Food Security) Program have helped to fund programs using the Cascade Group model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caregroupinfo.org/blog/criteria |title=Definition &amp; Criteria |publisher=Care Group Info |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Implementation of Child-focused Community Transformation (CFCT) in the 2010s'''

FH developed the concept of CFCT between 2005 and 2011 and officially launched CFCT as a unified model for community transformation with child-focused outcomes at the center of field implementation and the organization's strategic plan. Since September 2011, CFCT has formed the base of all Food for the Hungry program models. A core component of Food for the Hungry's mission is to "focus on the most vulnerable," with children believed to be the most prominent and vulnerable members of the communities Food for the Hungry serves. Child-focused does not mean that all development activity is centered solely on children, since children are supported and cared for by their families and community leaders. Therefore, the majority of CFCT activities are focused on strengthening families, the church, and community leaders. "Transformation" encompasses the process of radical change in behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and worldviews of individuals, communities, and cultures toward living in healthy relationship with God, others, themselves, and creation (Four Key Relationships).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myers|first1=Bryant L.|title=Walking with the poor : principles and practices of transformational development|date=2011|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, N.Y.|isbn=978-1570759390}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "transformational development" refers to the work that Food for the Hungry staff and community members do to achieve mutual transformation and advance and accelerate measurable well-being improvements for the most vulnerable.

=== Organizational Structure ===
Food for the Hungry, Inc. (FH/US) was incorporated by Larry Ward in the United States in 1971 and has existed continuously since then. Ward incorporated Food for the Hungry International (FHI) in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, in 1980. FHI was part of Ward's dream to implement unified relief and development programs worldwide through an international partnership of supporting national organizations (NOs) or affiliates.

FH/US became a supporting NO for FHI, along with like NOs in Japan (established in 1981), [[Canada]] (established in 1988), [[Sweden]] (established in 1988), [[Switzerland]] (established in 1988), [[Korea]] (established in 1989), [[United Kingdom]] (established in 1989) and a second organization in the United States, Korea-American Food for the Hungry International (established in 2002).&lt;ref name="Fex profile" /&gt;

In 2006, FH restructured to align operations with NOs in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States as members of FH Association (FHA), which was registered in Switzerland in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/food-hungry-association-fh |title=Food for the Hungry Association (FH) &amp;#124; GPPlatform |publisher=Gpplatform.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan and Korea aligned as Food for the Hungry International Federation (FHF) and, though loosely affiliated as members of a larger FHI "family," operate separately from FHA.&lt;ref&gt;https://vocf.net/uploaded_project/fhifdir07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

FH is the umbrella for all FHA NOs and relief and development fields. Field work occurs primarily in Asia, Africa, Central America, South America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/work/countries |title=Work &amp;#124; Countries &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; NOs support this work by raising funds, supplying human resources and helping to design and evaluate field programs.

FH is governed by a unified Board of Directors providing direct oversight of FHA and FH/US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/about/leadership/board |title=Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is led by President/CEO Gary Edmonds.

== Biblical Holism ==

A [[Christian worldview|biblical worldview]] is both a foundation and umbrella for FH's work. Food for the Hungry's Statement of Faith&lt;ref name="Vision" /&gt; corresponds to the Statement of Faith of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] (NAE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nae.net/about-us/statement-of-faith |title=Statement of Faith |publisher=Nae.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FH functions on the belief that poverty is the result of broken relationships: (1) between humans and humans, (2) between humans and creation and (3) between humans and God,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fh.org/2012/08/biblical-worldview/ |title=Biblical Worldview: Both a Foundation and an Umbrella - Food for the Hungry Blog |publisher=Blog.fh.org |date=2012-08-17 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that restoring these relationships in a holistic way is the key to overcoming poverty.

FH is not affiliated with any specific church or denomination, and its work is available to the world's most vulnerable people, regardless of race, gender or religion. While staff do not proselytize (use religious coercion or require a beneficiary to listen to a religious message before receiving help), biblical values infuse FH programs by promoting concepts that mend the broken relationships that result in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/organizations/food-for-the-hungry |title=Food for the Hungry |publisher=Berkleycenter.georgetown.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global FH partnership is committed to transformational development. This requires walking with churches, leaders and families to help them identify and overcome the issues that lock them in poverty. One of these issues is fatalistic worldviews that steal people's hope.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130215215831/http://dinkumfiles.com/2009/07/07/eastern-university-to-host-transformational-development-conference-august-7th-9th/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many organizations acknowledge that faith can be vital in development, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/partnership-opportunities/faith-based-community-organizations/history |title=Partnership Opportunities &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2014-07-18 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Heartbeat ===
In 2014, Food for the Hungry created a revised version of their "Vision, Mission, and Values" called "The Heartbeat of FH." The heartbeat is the values and principles that guide and shape the organization and is composed of values, vision, and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fh.org/about/values-vision-purpose/|title=FH Values, Mission, and Purpose|last=|first=|date=|website=Food for the Hungry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of International Impact ==

=== The Democratic Republic of the Congo ===
FH installed a community water pump in Kamalenge. The community uses the water pump for farming and personal use. Since installation, the water management committee in Kamalenge has managed the water pump. FH also helped families in [[Kateba]] learn about health and nutrition through songs and flipcharts. Villages that FH was able to work in are now free of malnutrition. FH also helped to build a seed multiplication station in Emilingombre so farmers would have more direct access to seeds and seedlings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.usaid.gov/2012/08/a-lasting-impact-on-food-security/ |title=A Lasting Impact on Food Security &amp;#124; USAID Impact |publisher=Blog.usaid.gov |date=2012-08-07 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haiti and the Dominican Republic ===
In 2012, when [[Hurricane Isaac (2012)]] hit [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], FH staff helped families who lost homes, animals and crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/when-the-spotlight-on-disasters-fade-the-work-goes-on-11820/ |title=When the Spotlight on Disasters Fade, the Work Goes on &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethiopia ===
Among several other countries, Food for the Hungry offers child sponsorships to children in [[Ethiopia]]. Sponsoring children in Ethiopia provides children with food, medical care, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/bringing-hope-to-the-hard-places-11847// |title=Bringing Hope to the Hard Places &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, FH reached approximately 84,652 households in Ethiopia. In addition to their work with families, FH helped 180,456 farmers improve access to markets due to road construction and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Foodaid"&gt;[http://foodaid.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Food-for-Peace-Mozambique-DRC-Ethiopia-Food-for-the-Hungry.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722232838/http://foodaid.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Food-for-Peace-Mozambique-DRC-Ethiopia-Food-for-the-Hungry.pdf |date=July 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republic of Mozambique ===
Food for the Hungry worked in Mozambique to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality – especially among children 0–23 months of age and pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caregroupinfo.org/docs/FH_Final_Eval_Report_27Dec2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, FH helped develop 182 Farmer Field and Life Groups in Mozambique with 3,276 people receiving services. Their efforts have helped impact approximately 111,000 people.&lt;ref name="Foodaid" /&gt;
FH's Mozambique Child Survival Project was called one of the world's best examples of what can be achieved at low cost to improve the health of children in high-mortality, low-resource settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry B. Perry|url=http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/5087/Perry/Henry|website=www.jhsph.edu|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110223401/http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/5087/Perry/Henry|archivedate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
FH is a charter member in good standing of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA).&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt; Their audited financial statement for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013 shows that 35 percent of funding came from the U.S. government, 62 percent from individuals, 3 percent from churches, businesses, and foundations. Of this funding, 83 percent was used on programs, 11 percent on fundraising and 6 percent on administrative costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/fh_us/docs/2011_annual_report_sm?mode=window&amp;backgroundColor=%23222222 |title=Food for the Hungry 2011 Annual Report by Food for the Hungry |publisher=ISSUU |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
In 2012, Food for the Hungry was one of hundreds of non-profits chosen by the [[IRS]] for a routine audit of their tax return for 2007. They cooperated fully with the IRS. A preliminary letter listed several issues that IRS wanted to clarify. That letter was illegally leaked to the media, launching a media controversy over unconfirmed facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/gik |title=Gifts-in-Kind &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Food for the Hungry received a letter from the IRS. The letter accepted the tax return as originally submitted, and acknowledged that Food for the Hungry had followed all laws and accepted accounting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wayback Machine|url=https://www.fh.org/images/general/docs/IRS_Audit_Closing_Release_final.pdf|website=www.fh.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505182100/https://www.fh.org/images/general/docs/IRS_Audit_Closing_Release_final.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As charter members of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]], Food for the Hungry are in compliance with their Seven Standards of Responsible Stewardship. In addition, the organization has received [https://www.guidestar.org/profile/95-2680390 GuideStar's Platinum Seal of Transparency], which is the highest level of recognition offered by Guidestar to non-profits and charities. 

There are no outstanding issues concerning Food for the Hungry's involvement in issues with the IRS.

== Accomplishments ==
Food for the Hungry's HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities previously were smaller projects compared to its food distribution and development programs. In 2005, FH was awarded an $8.3 million grant through the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) to expand its prevention programs in [[Ethiopia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mozambique]] and Haiti. This grant is part of a $100-million pool of PEPFAR abstinence funds awarded by USAID through its [[Abstinence]] and Healthy Choices for Youth program in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marina Walker Guevaraemail |url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/2006/11/30/6400/food-hungry |title=Food for the Hungry &amp;#124; Center for Public Integrity |publisher=Publicintegrity.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Davis, formerly Chief Program Officer for FH, developed the Barrier Analysis methodology earlier in his career and was a pioneer of the Care Group model, which empowers volunteer peer educators to promote life saving behaviors with mothers at the community level. In 2012, while working with FH, his work earned him the [[American Public Health Association]] Gordon-Wyon Award for Excellence in Community-Oriented Public Health, Epidemiology and Practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apha.org/membergroups/sections/aphasections/intlhealth/cbphcw/activities/Gordon+Wyon+Awards.htm |title=Gordon Wyon Awards |publisher=APHA |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[David Evans (administrator)|David Evans]], then U.S. President of Food for the Hungry spoke at the 2012 Faith Suc   vg ncv   n   mmit on AIDS in [[Washington, DC]]. They were recognized for their volunteer efforts like transporting water, washing clothes, bathing those in need, counseling, and praying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/faith-summit-on-aids-receives-accolades-11034/ |title=Faith Summit on AIDS Receives Accolades &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==

=== Sports Initiatives ===
In the 2010s, Food for the Hungry began partnering with several [[Major League Baseball]] players and cultural icons. This culminated in the creation of two sports campaigns, Striking Out Poverty in 2016, which partners with players in the [[MLB]], and FH Champions in 2017, which focuses on partnerships with players in the [[National Football League|NFL]]. Striking Out Poverty (also known as "K Poverty" or "SOP") began with a focus on ending poverty in nine communities in the [[Dominican Republic]], where baseball is the national sport and more than 500 baseball players in the MLB hail from the Dominican Republic. Food for the Hungry's Global Ambassador is [[Roberto Clemente Jr.|Roberto Clemente Jr]]., a former pro baseball player and son of [[Roberto Clemente]], the first Latin American player to compile 3,000 hits in Major League Baseball history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fh.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Roberto-Clemente-Jr-Ambassador.pdf|title=Food for the Hungry Names Roberto Clemente Jr. Global Ambassador|last=|first=|date=March 16, 2017|work=Food for the Hungry|access-date=2017-11-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other athletes who have participated in Striking Out Poverty campaigns and vision trips include [[Nick Ahmed]], [[Chase Anderson]], [[Dee Gordon]], [[Yasmani Grandal]], [[Liam Hendriks]], [[Starling Marte]], [[Gregory Polanco]], [[Rob Refsnyder]], [[Moisés Sierra]], [[Adam Wainwright]], and [[Luke Weaver (baseball)|Luke Weaver]]. NFL athletes who have worked with Food for the Hungry formerly as "Pro Player Partners" or as part of Champions by FH include [[Jarvis Jenkins]], [[Jonathan Meeks]], [[Derrick Morgan (American football)|Derrick Morgan]], [[Coty Sensabaugh]], and [[Michael Thomas (defensive back)|Michael Thomas]].

=== Artists and Influencers ===
Food for the Hungry also partners with Christian artists and influencers including [[TobyMac]], [[Lecrae]], [[Switchfoot]], [[Third Day]] and more as part of its Artists Program to promote Food for the Hungry at their concerts and events around the country. Each artists sponsors his or her own child with Food for the Hungry as part of their shared God-given mission with FH to end extreme poverty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21476">'''Functional fixedness''' is a [[cognitive bias]] that limits a person to use an object only in the way it is traditionally used. The concept of functional fixedness originated in [[Gestalt psychology]], a movement in psychology that emphasizes [[holism|holistic]] processing. [[Karl Duncker]] defined functional fixedness as being a "mental block against using an object in a new way that is required to solve a problem".&lt;ref name=Duncker1945&gt;Duncker, K. (1945). "On problem solving". ''[[Psychological Monographs]]'', 58:5 (Whole No. 270).&lt;/ref&gt; This "block" limits the ability of an individual to use components given to them to complete a task, as they cannot move past the original purpose of those components. For example, if someone needs a paperweight, but they only have a hammer, they may not see how the hammer can be used as a paperweight. Functional fixedness is this inability to see a hammer's use as anything other than for pounding nails; the person couldn't think to use the hammer in a way other than in its conventional function.

When tested, 5-year-old children show no signs of functional fixedness. It has been argued that this is because at age 5, any goal to be achieved with an object is equivalent to any other goal. However, by age 7, children have acquired the tendency to treat the originally intended purpose of an object as special.&lt;ref&gt;German, T.P., &amp; Defeyter, M.A. (2000). "Immunity to functional fixedness in young children". ''[[Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review]]'', 7(4), 707-712.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples in research==
Experimental paradigms typically involve solving problems in novel situations in which the subject has the use of a familiar object in an unfamiliar context.  The object may be familiar from the subject's past experience or from previous tasks within an experiment.

=== Candle box ===
{{main|Candle problem}}
[[Image:genimage.jpg|frame|Candle box problem diagram]]
In a classic experiment demonstrating functional fixedness, Duncker (1945)&lt;ref name=Duncker1945/&gt; gave participants a candle, a box of thumbtacks, and a book of matches, and asked them to attach the candle to the wall so that it did not drip onto the table below. Duncker found that participants tried to attach the candle directly to the wall with the tacks, or to glue it to the wall by melting it. Very few of them thought of using the inside of the box as a candle-holder and tacking this to the wall. In Duncker's terms, the participants were "fixated" on the box's normal function of holding thumbtacks and could not re-conceptualize it in a manner that allowed them to solve the problem. For instance, participants presented with an empty tack box were two times more likely to solve the problem than those presented with the tack box used as a container&lt;ref name=Adamson1952&gt;Adamson, R.E. (1952). "Functional Fixedness as related to problem solving: A repetition of three experiments". ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology]]'', 44, 288-291.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Frank and Ramscar (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Michael C., and Michael Ramscar. "How do Presentation and Context Influence Representation for Functional Fixedness Tasks?" ''Proceedings of the 25th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; gave a written version of the candle problem to undergraduates at Stanford. When the problem was given with identical instructions to those in the original experiment, only 23% of the students were able to solve the problem. For another group of students, the noun phrases such as "box of matches" were underlined, and for a third group, the nouns (e.g., "box") were underlined.  For these two groups, 55% and 47% were able to solve the problem effectively. In a follow-up experiment, all the nouns except "box" were underlined and similar results were produced. The authors concluded that students' performance was contingent on their representation of the lexical concept "box" rather than instructional manipulations. The ability to overcome functional fixedness was contingent on having a flexible representation of the word box which allows students to see that the box can be used when attaching a candle to a wall.

When Adamson (1952)&lt;ref name=Adamson1952/&gt; replicated Duncker's box experiment, Adamson split participants into 2 experimental groups: preutilization and no preutilization. In this experiment, when there is preutilization, meaning when objects are presented to participants in a traditional manner (materials are in the box, thus using the box as a container), participants are less likely to consider the box for any other use, whereas with no preutilization (when boxes are presented empty), participants are more likely to think of other uses for the box.

===Two-cord problem===
Birch and Rabinowitz (1951)&lt;ref&gt;Birch, H.G., &amp; Rabinowitz, H.S. (1951). "The negative effect of previous experience on productive thinking". ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'', 41, 121-125.&lt;/ref&gt; adapted the two-cord problem from [[Norman Maier]] (1930, 1931), where subjects would be given 2 cords hanging from the ceiling, and 2 heavy objects in the room. They are told they must connect the cords, but they are just far enough apart that one cannot reach the other easily. The solution was to tie one of the heavy objects to a cord and be a weight, and swing the cord as a pendulum, catch the rope as it swings while holding on to the other rope, and then tie them together. The participants are split into 3 groups: Group R, which completes a pretask of completing an electrical circuit by using a relay, Group S, which completes the circuit with a switch, and Group C which is the control group given no pretest experience. Group R participants were more likely to use the switch as the weight, and Group S were more likely to use the relay. Both groups did so because their previous experience led them to use the objects a certain way, and functional fixedness did not allow them to see the objects as being used for another purpose.

=== Barometer question ===
{{main|Barometer question}}
The barometer question is an example of an incorrectly designed examination question demonstrating functional fixedness that causes a moral dilemma for the examinator. In its classic form, popularized by American test designer professor Alexander Calandra (1911–2006), the question asked the student to "show how it is possible to determine the height of a tall building with the aid of a barometer?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1968dec21-00060?View=PDF|title="Angels on a Pin" by Alexander Calandra, The Saturday Review, Saturday, December 21st, 1968|website=UNZ.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The examinator was confident that there was one, and only one, correct answer. Contrary to the examinator's expectations, the student responded with a series of completely different answers. These answers were also correct, yet none of them proved the student's competence in the specific academic field being tested.

Calandra presented the incident as a real-life, [[First-person narrative|first-person]] experience that occurred during the [[Sputnik crisis]].&lt;ref name=C229&gt;Calandra, Alexander, "Angels on a Pin". Reproduced in Barnes et al., pp. 228-229. p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Calandra's essay, "Angels on a Pin", was published in 1959 in ''Pride'', a magazine of the [[Council for Advancement and Support of Education|American College Public Relations Association]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DNWgAAAAMAAJ Pride, volumes 3-4]'' (1959).

===Is functional fixedness universal?===
Researchers have investigated whether functional fixedness is affected by [[culture]].
 
In a recent study, preliminary evidence supporting the universality of functional fixedness was found.&lt;ref name=GermanBarrett2005&gt;German, T.P., &amp; Barrett, H.C. (2005). [http://www.anthro.ucla.edu/faculty/barrett/german-barrett-PS.pdf "Functional Fixedness in a Technologically Sparse Culture"]. ''[[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]]'', 16, 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The study's purpose was to test if individuals from non-industrialized societies, specifically with low exposure to "high-tech" artifacts, demonstrated functional fixedness. The study tested the [[Shuar]], hunter-horticulturalists of the Amazon region of Ecuador, and compared them to a control group from an industrial culture.

The Shuar community had only been exposed to a limited amount of industrialized artifacts, such as machete, axes, cooking pots, nails, shotguns, and fishhooks, all considered "low-tech". Two tasks were assessed to participants for the study: the box task, where participants had to build a tower to help a character from a fictional storyline to reach another character with a limited set of varied materials; the spoon task, where participants were also given a problem to solve based on a fictional story of a rabbit that had to cross a river (materials were used to represent settings) and they were given varied materials including a spoon. In the box-task, participants were slower to select the materials than participants in control conditions, but no difference in time to solve the problem was seen. In the spoon task, participants were slower in selection and completion of task. Results showed that Individuals from non-industrial ("technologically sparse cultures") were susceptible to functional fixedness. They were faster to use artifacts without priming than when design function was explained to them. This occurred even though participants were less exposed to industrialized manufactured artifacts, and that the few artifacts they currently use were used in multiple ways regardless of their design.&lt;ref name=GermanBarrett2005/&gt;

==="Following the Wrong Footsteps: Fixation Effects of Pictorial Examples in a Design Problem-Solving Task"===

Investigators examined in two experiments "whether the inclusion of examples with inappropriate elements, in addition to the instructions for a design problem, would produce fixation effects in students naive to design tasks".&lt;ref&gt;Chrysikou, Evangelia G.; Weisberg, Robert W. "Following the Wrong Footsteps: Fixation Effects of Pictorial Examples in a Design Problem-Solving Task". ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition]]'', Vol 31(5), Sep 2005, 1134-1148. {{doi|10.1037/0278-7393.31.5.1134}}&lt;/ref&gt; They examined the inclusion of examples of inappropriate elements, by explicitly depicting problematic aspects of the problem presented to the students through example designs. They tested non-expert participants on three problem conditions: with standard instruction, fixated (with inclusion of problematic design), and defixated (inclusion of problematic design accompanied with helpful methods). They were able to support their hypothesis by finding that a) problematic design examples produce significant fixation effects, and b) fixation effects can be diminished with the use of defixating instructions.

In "The Disposable Spill-Proof Coffee Cup Problem", adapted from Janson &amp; Smith, 1991, participants were asked to construct as many designs as possible for an inexpensive, disposable, spill-proof coffee cup. Standard condition participants were presented only with instructions. In the fixated condition, participants were presented with instructions, a design, and problems they should be aware of. Finally, in the defixated condition, participants were presented the same as other conditions in addition to suggestions of design elements they should avoid using. The other two problems included building a bike rack, and designing a container for cream cheese.

==Techniques to avoid functional fixedness==

===Overcoming functional fixedness in science classrooms with analogical transfer===

Based on the assumption that students are functionally fixed, a study on analogical transfer in the science classroom shed light on significant data that could provide an overcoming technique for functional fixedness. The findings support the fact that students show positive transfer (performance) on problem solving after being presented with analogies of certain structure and format.&lt;ref name=Solomon1994&gt;Solomon, I. (1994). "Analogical Transfer and 'Functional Fixedness' in the Science Classroom". ''[[Journal of Educational Research]]'', 87(6), 371-377.&lt;/ref&gt; The present study expanded Duncker's experiments from 1945 by trying to demonstrate that when students were "presented with a single analogy formatted as a problem, rather than as a story narrative, they would orient the task of problem-solving and facilitate positive transfer".&lt;ref name=Solomon1994/&gt;

A total of 266 freshmen students from a high school science class participated in the study. The experiment was a 2x2 design where conditions: "task contexts" (type and format) vs. "prior knowledge" (specific vs. general) were attested. Students were classified into 5 different groups, where 4 were according to their prior science knowledge (ranging from specific to general), and 1 served as a control group (no analog presentation). The 4 different groups were then classified into "analog type and analog format" conditions, structural or surface types and problem or surface formats.

Inconclusive evidence was found for positive analogical transfer based on prior knowledge; however, groups did demonstrate variability. The problem format and the structural type of analog presentation showed the highest positive transference to problem solving. The researcher suggested that a well-thought and planned analogy relevant in format and type to the problem-solving task to be completed can be helpful for students to overcome functional fixedness. This study not only brought new knowledge about the human mind at work but also provides important tools for educational purposes and possible changes that teachers can apply as aids to lesson plans.&lt;ref name=Solomon1994/&gt;

===Uncommitting===
One study suggests that functional fixedness can be combated by design decisions from functionally fixed designs so that the essence of the design is kept (Latour, 1994).&lt;ref name=Latour1994&gt;Latour, Larry (1994). [http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~larry/latour/ECAI/paper-sent/paper-sent.html "Controlling Functional Fixedness: the Essence of Successful Reuse"].&lt;/ref&gt; This helps the subjects who have created functionally fixed designs understand how to go about solving general problems of this type, rather than using the fixed solution for a specific problem. Latour performed an experiment researching this by having software engineers analyze a fairly standard bit of code—the [[quicksort]] algorithm—and use it to create a partitioning function. Part of the quicksort algorithm involves partitioning a list into subsets so that it can be sorted; the experimenters wanted to use the code from within the algorithm to just do the partitioning. To do this, they abstracted each block of code in the function, discerning the purpose of it, and deciding if it is needed for the partitioning algorithm. This abstracting allowed them to reuse the code from the quicksort algorithm to create a working partition algorithm without having to design it from scratch.&lt;ref name=Latour1994/&gt;

===Overcoming prototypes===
A comprehensive study exploring several classical functional fixedness experiments showed an overlying theme of overcoming prototypes. Those that were successful at completing the tasks had the ability to look beyond the prototype, or the original intention for the item in use. Conversely, those that could not create a successful finished product could not move beyond the original use of the item. This seemed to be the case for functional fixedness categorization studies as well. Reorganization into categories of seemingly unrelated items was easier for those that could look beyond intended function. Therefore, there is a need to overcome the prototype in order to avoid functional fixedness. Carnevale (1998)&lt;ref name=Carnevale1998&gt;Carnevale, Peter J. (1998). "Social Values and Social Conflict Creative Problem Solving and Categorization". ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'', 74(5), 1300.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests analyzing the object and mentally breaking it down into its components. After that is completed, it is essential to explore the possible functions of those parts. In doing so, an individual may familiarize themselves with new ways to use the items that are available to them at the givens. Individuals are therefore thinking creatively and overcoming the prototypes that limit their ability to successfully complete the functional fixedness problem.&lt;ref name=Carnevale1998/&gt;

===The generic parts technique===
For each object, you need to decouple its function from its form. McCaffrey (2012)&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, T. (2012). "Innovation relies on the obscure: A key to overcoming the classic functional fixedness problem". ''Psychological Science'', 23(3), 215-218.&lt;/ref&gt; shows a highly effective technique for doing so. As you break an object into its parts, ask yourself two questions. "Can I subdivide the current part further?" If yes, do so. "Does my current description imply a use?" If yes, create a more generic description involving its shape and material. For example, initially I divide a candle into its parts: wick and wax. The word "wick" implies a use: burning to emit light. So, describe it more generically as a string. Since "string" implies a use, I describe it more generically: interwoven fibrous strands. This brings to mind that I could use the wick to make a wig for my hamster. Since "interwoven fibrous strands" does not imply a use, I can stop working on wick and start working on wax. People trained in this technique solved 67% more problems that suffered from functional fixedness than a control group. This technique systematically strips away all the layers of associated uses from an object and its parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mie.umass.edu/news/mccaffrey-develops-toolkit-boosting-problem-solving-skills|title=McCaffrey Develops Toolkit for Boosting Problem-solving Skills - Mechanical and Industrial Engineering - UMass Amherst|website=mie.umass.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Krönung des Tugendhelden.jpg|thumb|''Krönung des Tugendhelden'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], circa 1612-1614]]


'''Glory''' is high renown, praise and honor obtained by notable achievements, and based in extensive common consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oxford Dictionaries|title=Glory|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/glory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merriam-Webster|title=Glory|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/glory}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek culture fame and glory were highly considered, as it is explained in  The Symposium, one of Plato's dialogs.

==In Greek culture (Kleos)==
{{Main|Kleos}}
[[File:Achilles mourning the death of Patroclus, Corinthian Chytra.jpg|thumb|350px|Achilles mourning the death of Patroclus. Corinthian Chytra]]
'''''Kleos''''' (Greek: κλέος) is the [[Greek language|Greek]] word often translated to "renown", or "glory". It is related to the word "to hear" and carries the implied meaning of "what others hear about you". A Greek [[hero]] earns ''kleos'' through accomplishing great deeds, often through his own death. ''Kleos'' is invariably transferred from father to son; the son is responsible for carrying on and building upon the "glory" of the father.

''Kleos'' is a common theme in [[Homer]]'s epics, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the main example in the latter being that of [[Odysseus]] and his son Telemachus, who is concerned that his father may have died a pathetic and pitiable death at sea rather than a reputable and gracious one in battle.

==Plato==
The Greek philosopher Plato, in his dialog [[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]] devoted to discuss love, makes a digression into the subject of fame and glory. It is in the section that deals with the dialog between [[Socrates]] and [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]]. She is explaining that men search ways to reach some kind of immortality, for instance by means of physical and intellectual procreation. Then asserts that the love for fame and glory is very strong, and in fact to obtain them, men are ready to engage in great efforts, and also run risks and sacrifices, even of their lives, and still more for this than for their children.  Then makes concrete references to [[Alcestis]] that died to save [[Admetus]], or [[Achilles]] to avenge [[Patroclus]], and to [[Codrus]], as examples of heroes in search of fame and immortal renown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Walter|title=Plato, The Symposium|date=1951|publisher=Penguin Classics|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jorge Manrique==
[[Jorge Manrique]] was a prominent Spanish poet of the fifteenth century. His most celebrated work was ''Coplas a la Muerte de su Padre'' (''Stanzas about the death of his father'') that was translated into the English language by poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. In it is an explanation of the three lives of men:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*The terrestrial life, that ends with the death
*The life of fame, that is retained by men's memory.
*The eternal life, of the Christian faith.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The life of fame is expressed in the following verses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cortina|first1=Augusto|title=Coplas por la Muerte de su Padre|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor-din/obra-completa--0/html/ff6c9480-82b1-11df-acc7-002185ce6064_4.html#I_53_|publisher=Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes|accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;No se os haga tan amarga         (Should not be so bitter)		
la batalla temerosa              (The fearsome battle)		
que esperáis,                    (you are facing)		
pues otra vida más larga         (since a longer life)		
de la fama gloriosa              (of glorious fame)		
acá dejáis,                      (here you are leaving)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{redirect|Bona fide|other uses|Bona fide (disambiguation)|and|Good faith (disambiguation)}}
'''Good faith''' ({{lang-la|bona fides}}), in human interactions, is a sincere intention to be fair, open, and honest, regardless of the outcome of the interaction. While some Latin phrases lose their literal meaning over centuries, this is not the case with ''bona fides''; it is still widely used and interchangeable with its generally accepted modern-day English translation of ''good faith''.&lt;ref&gt;Garger, John. "Translating Arguendo and Bona Fide from Latin to English." ''Bright Hub Education''. Bright Hub Inc., 5 Jan 2012. Retrieved 6 Feb 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important concept within [[law]] and [[business]]. The opposed concepts are [[bad faith]], ''mala fides'' (duplicity) and [[perfidy]] (pretense). In contemporary English, the usage of ''bona fides'' is synonymous with [[credential]]s and [[identity document|identity]]. The phrase is sometimes used in job advertisements, and should not be confused with the [[bona fide occupational qualifications|''bona fide'' occupational qualifications]] or the employer's good faith effort, as described below.

==''Bona fides''==
''Bona fides'' is a Latin phrase meaning "good faith". Its [[Ablative (Latin)|ablative case]] is ''bona fide'', meaning "in good faith", it is often used as an adjective to mean "genuine". While today ''fides'' is concomitant to faith, a more technical translation of the Latin concept would be something like "reliability", in the sense of a trust between two parties for the potentiality of a relationship. In [[ancient Rome]] ''bona fides'' was always assumed by both sides, had implied responsibilities, and both legal and religious consequences if broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams |first=John P.|title=THE ROMAN CONCEPT OF FIDES|website= sun.edu|date= May 2009|url=http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/fides.html|accessdate= &lt;!-- January 2015 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fides (deity)|Fides]] was one of the original virtues to be considered a religious "divinity" in [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman paganism]].

==Law==
{{main article|Good faith (law)}}
In [[law]], ''bona fides'' denotes the [[:wikt:mental state|mental]] and [[morality|moral]] states of honesty and [[belief|conviction]] regarding either the [[truth]] or the [[falsity]] of a [[proposition]], or of a body of [[opinion]]; likewise regarding either the rectitude or the depravity of a line of [[Action (philosophy)|conduct]]. As a legal concept ''bona fides'' is especially important in matters of [[Equity (law)|equity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03|url=http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=819&amp;bold=|title=good faith |publisher=Law.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Good Faith as an international principle of law [http://www.trans-lex.org/901000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''bona fide'' is also proclaimed by the original version of the [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Magna Carta]] (1215), Clause I&lt;/ref&gt; In contract law, the implied covenant of good faith is a general presumption that the parties to a contract will deal with each other honestly and fairly, so as not to destroy the right of the other party or parties to receive the benefits of the contract. In insurance law, the insurer's breach of the implied covenant may give rise to a legal liability known as [[insurance bad faith]].

Most US jurisdictions view breaches of implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing solely as a variant of breach of [[contract]]. Linguistically, in the US, American English usage of ''bona fides'' applies it as synonymous with [[credential]]s, professional background, and documents attesting a person's [[identity document|identity]], which is not synonymous with [[bona fide occupational qualifications|''bona fide'' occupational qualifications]]. More recently, other common law countries have begun to adopt good faith as a general principle. In the UK, the High Court in ''[[Yam Seng Pte Ltd v Int Trade Corp Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2013] EWHC 111&lt;/ref&gt; expressed this preference. In Canada, the Supreme Court declared in ''[[Bhasin v. Hrynew]]'' that good faith was a general organizing principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14438/index.do |title=SCC 71|year=2014|website=scc-csc.lexum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment efforts==
[[Bona fide occupational qualifications|''Bona fide'' occupational qualifications]] (employer's good faith effort) are qualities or attributes that employers are allowed to consider when making decisions on the hiring and retaining of employees. An employer's good faith effort is used as an evaluation tool by the jurisdiction during the annual program review process to determine an employer's level of commitment to the reduction goals of the [[Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction|CTR Law]]. [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal]] and [[State governments of the United States|state government]]s are required by [[Affirmative action#United States|affirmative action]] (and other such laws) to look for disabled, minority, female, and veteran business enterprises when bidding public jobs. Good faith effort law varies from state to state and even within states depending on the awarding department of the government. Most good faith effort requires advertising in state certified publications, usually a trade and a focus publication. Other countries such as Canada have similar programs.

==In wikis==
Public [[wiki]]s depend on implicitly or explicitly assuming that its users are acting in good faith. [[Wikipedia]]'s principle ''Assume Good Faith'' (often abbreviated AGF) has been a stated guideline since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"Wikipedia:Assume good faith." Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. 13 May 2005, 20:361 UTC. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith&amp;oldid=14428829 Wikipedia:Assume good faith]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "the first principle in the Wikipedia etiquette".&lt;ref&gt;Goldspink, Chris (2007), "[http://isce.edu/ISCE_Group_Site/web-content/ISCE_Events/Auckland_2007/Papers/Regular/032_Goldspink.pdf Normative self-regulation in the emergence of global network institutions: The Case of Wikipedia]", ''Proceedings of the 13th ANZSYS Conference'' - Auckland, New Zealand, 2-5 December 2007; Systemic Development: Local Solutions in a Global Environment&lt;/ref&gt; According to one study of users' motives for contributing to Wikipedia, "while participants have both individualistic and collaborative motives, collaborative ([[Altruism|altruistic]]) motives dominate."&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, C., Prasarnphanich, P. (2007) "Innovating collaborative content creation: the role of altruism and wiki technology",  ''Proceedings of 40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences'', 3-6 January 2007, Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12613">Since 2002, the '''Innsbruck School of Peace and Conflict Studies''' has been developed by [[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]] and his team at the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies at the [[University of Innsbruck]], Austria. On January 1, 2017 a Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies was established at the University of Innsbruck's Faculty for Social and Political Sciences, which has a mandate for conducting Peace and Conflict Studies Research and is home to the Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies, with its UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies and its MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation.

== Research and Publications ==
The Innsbruck School of Peace and Conflict Studies became famous for its unique approach to peace research with the key phrase “transrational peaces” and with its specific and tough training method in the sense of [[John Paul Lederach]]'s elicitive conflict transformation”. Both principles are applied in practice and developed further in the frame of the MA Program for Peace Studies.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies (2014): MA Program, available at URL: http://www.uibk.ac.at/peacestudies/ma-program/, last accessed November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The UNESCO Chair promotes further research in these fields and the publication of the respective results, in the following book series:
* Many Peaces Trilogy (Palgrave) by Wolfgang Dietrich: Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture (Vol. 1), Elicitive Conflict Transformation and the Transrational Shift in Peace Politics (Vol.2) and Elicitive Conflict Mapping (Vol 3, in translation).
* Elicitivas (Verlag Springer, featuring Juan José Albert Gutiérrez (translated by Matthias Gossner) and Winfried Wagner.
* Masters of Peace (LIT, Verlag Springer), featuring the works of Samrat Schmiem Kumar, Katya Buchleitner, Paula Ditzel Facci, Paul Bukuluki, Natalia Lozano Mancera, Alicia Dueck, Catalina Vallejo Piedrahíta, [https://www.prio.org/People/Person/?x=8154 Noor Jdid], Kathleen McGoey, Billene Seyoum Woldeyes, Sophie Friedel, [http://adhamhamed.com Adham Hamed], Morten Frederiksen, Heela Najibullah and Jennie Sandstad.

Furthermore, a series of edited Volumes has emerged in the framework of the Innsbruck School:
Key Texts of Peace Studies (Die Kommende Demokratie Series, LIT)
Palgrave Handbook of Peace Studies (Palgrave)
Transrational Resonances (Palgrave)

[[Norbert Koppensteiner]],&lt;ref&gt;Koppensteiner, Norbert (2014): Norbert Koppensteiner: Home. Available at URL: http://koppensteiner.wissweb.at, last accessed November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; a Dietrich-student and program coordinator at the MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation, is another important representative of the Innsbruck School of Peace and Conflict Studies. In his book The Art of the Transpersonal Self he draws on findings of humanistic and transpersonal psychology. His work can be seen as a critique of some of Modernity’s founding principles like truth. Koppensteiner argues that the autonomous and self grounded subject, morals or solvability of conflicts have become sites of contestation and debate. He suggests to re-think some of those categories being debated in (post)modernity by invoking transpersonal and transrational transpositions. Asking about the continued possibilities for subjectivation, Koppensteiner sketches the outlines of an art of living for a subjectivity perceived as constantly emergent and in transformation, a subjectivity that dares to embrace conflict as part of its transpersonal relational becoming and that emerges through an ongoing transformation of the self understood as an aesthetic (Apollonian) and energetic (Dionysian) practice. The strictly relational understanding of peaces and conflict that Koppensteiner proposes is one of the central ontological assumptions of the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies.

Other important representatives of the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies are Josefina Echavarría (Research and Publications Coordinator), Daniela Ingruber (Coordinator MA Program), Jennifer Murphy and Andreas Oberprantacher. Each academic year leading international scholars of Peace and Conflict Studies visit the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies and its MA Program at the University of Innsbruck.

The Innsbruck School of Peace Studies is based on [[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]'s transrational approach to Peace Studies and is outlined in his Many Peaces Trilogy. Spanning continents as well as disciplines, Dietrich presents a panorama of diverse interpretations of peace in world history and culture. In a journey through time and space, Dietrich outlines the so-called five families of peace - energetic, moral, modern, post-modern and trans-rational. He stresses the importance of combining rationality and reason with human properties such as emotion and spirituality in applied peace work. This ontological assumption indicates a paradigm shift and proposes a new epistemological understanding of peace, which is at the heart of the Innsbruck School's peace philosophy.

=== Elicitive Conflict Transformation ===
Elicitive Conflict Transformation was first introduced to the field by John Paul Lederach in 1995 and is the applied method of transrational peace philosophy. Drawing on the debate on [[multi-track diplomacy]], Lederach initially distinguished between three levels of conflict: 
# Top Leaders
# Middle-Range Leaders
# Grassroots

Wolfgang Dietrich draws on Lederach's systemic approach to conflict and developed a multi-layered model of conflict analysis. Furthermore, he systematizes elective conflict transformation techniques in three main groups: 
# Voice Oriented Approaches to Conflict Transformation; e.g. non-violent communication after Marshall Rosenberg and Theme-Centered Interaction after Ruth Cohn.
# Body-oriented approaches to conflict transformation; e.g. [[Theatre for Living]] after [[David Diamond (theatre)|David Diamond]], Butho- and Five Rhythms Dance, after Gabrielle Roth
# breath oriented approaches to conflict transformation; e.g. Holotropic Breathwork after [[Stanislav Grof]] and Sylvester Walch.

All three types of approaches to conflict share a strong reference to systems theory and hence a strictly relational understanding of conflicts.

=== Elicitive Conflict Mapping ===
Elicitive Conflict Mapping is a brand-new tool that has been developed at the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies. By bringing together the theoretical and academic building blocks of the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies in a didactical format, with special emphasis on the graphic components, ECM aims to support those in search of:
* Understanding and clarifying the conflict episode
* Visibilizing the conflict parties
* Viewing the conflict dynamics at different levels and through different layers&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies (2014): Elicitive Conflict Mapping Available at URL: http://www.uibk.ac.at/peacestudies/ecm/, last accessed November 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;


== Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies ==
In January 2017 the Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies was inaugurated at the University of Innsbruck's Faculty for Social and Political Sciences. The Unit for Peace and Conflict Studies consists of the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies, which is the rooftop for a large number of research and cooperation projects and the MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation.

=== UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies ===
The UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies of the University of Innsbruck was established in June 2008 as a consequence of the systematic research on the interpretations of peaces and the unique approach to peace studies as developed by Innsbruck’s MA program for Peace Studies since 2001. The agreement has been signed between the UNESCO, represented by its Director-General Koichiro Matsuura, and the University of Innsbruck, represented by its rector Karlheinz Töchterle.

In the light of the excellent results achieved and confirmed by the positive evaluation of the report on its activities, UNESCO renewed in February 2015 the 2008 agreement concerning the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies at the University of Innsbruck until June 2019.

According to the agreement the main purposes of the UNESCO Chair are:
# the promotion of an integrated system of research, training, information and documentation in the field of peace studies;
# the facilitation of collaboration between high-level, internationally recognized researchers and teaching staff of the University and other institutions in Austria, in Europe and North America, and other regions of the world;
# the reinforcement of the existing network of cooperating partners through further regional, as well as international, cooperation;
# the enhancement and complement of the already existing on-line teaching methods;
# the exchange of professors, researchers, and students with other universities within the framework of UNITWIN/UNESCO Chairs Programme.

=== The MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Studies ===
Founded in 2002, the MA Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation has become a leading Masters Program, training the next generation of Peace and Conflict Studies scholars and Conflict Workers. In its didactical approach the program follows a relational approach to conflict of elective conflict transformation, which is conveyed to the students in theory and practice. After the successful completion of an MA thesis students are awarded the academic title Master of Arts (120 ECTS Credit Points). The first UNESCO Chairholder Professor Wolfgang Dietrich is the third academic director of the MA Program, following Prof. [[Anton Pelinka]] and Prof. Alan Scott in this function.

=== Unit for Peace Studies Alumni Network ===
Established in 2008, a vast amount of alumni initiatives have emerged within the active network of graduates from the MA Program in Peace and Conflict Studies. Amongst others this includes the Innsbruck Academic Festival of Many Peaces, the Many Peaces Magazine, the Peace Fund and the Many Peaces e.V..

==== Many Peaces Festival ====
The Innsbruck Academic Festival of Many Peaces is an international peace and conflict studies conference, facilitating a dialogue amongst scholars engaged within the field of transrational peace philosophy, as well as practitioners, within the field of elective conflict transformation. The 1st Innsbruck Academic Festival took place between August 9 and 14 2015 at the Grillhof Seminar Center in Innsbruck, Austria.

==== Many Peaces Magazine====
The Many Peaces Magazine&lt;ref&gt;http://magazine.manypeaces.org&lt;/ref&gt; was conceptualized and launched in 2014 by Adham Hamed, Mayme Lefurgey, Paul Lauer and Isabelle Guibert. It was created as an outlet to showcase the work of alumni, students, cooperation partners and friends of the Master of Arts Program in Peace, Development, Security and International Conflict Transformation and the UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies located at Universität Innsbruck, Austria. The magazine is published twice a year, in January and July of each year. The Many Peaces Magazine team has changed and developed over the past volumes and is currently coordinated by a team spread out over three continents and features authors and stories from around the globe. Many of the articles, stories and contributions that can be found in the magazine relate to the field of Peace Studies in some way, but more specifically to the fields of Transrational Peace Philosophy and Elicitive Conflict Transformation.

The '''list of higher education institutions with open Title IX Sexual Violence investigations''', is a public list of institutions under investigation by the [[Office for Civil Rights]] in the [[United States Department of Education]], first made public on May 1, 2014.&lt;ref name=EDAnnounce&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Department of Education Releases List of Higher Education Institutions with Open Title IX Sexual Violence Investigations|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-list-higher-education-institutions-open-title-i|website=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When announcing the schools under investigation, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights [[Catherine E. Lhamon]] suggested that "increased transparency will spur community dialogue about this important issue... and foster better public awareness of civil rights."&lt;ref name=EDAnnounce/&gt;

Investigations previously went unannounced, and were known only to members of university and college communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steinhauer|first1=Jennifer|last2=Joachim|first2=David|title=55 Colleges Named in Federal Inquiry Into Handling of Sexual Assault Cases|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/us/politics/us-lists-colleges-under-inquiry-over-sex-assault-cases.html?_r=0|accessdate=6 August 2014|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list constitutes the first time the federal government has announced ongoing sexual violence investigations. The decision to release the names of universities and colleges under investigation was due to pressure from both the [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]] and the [[New Campus Anti-Rape Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newman|first1=Jonah|last2=Sander|first2=Libby|title=Promise Unfulfilled?|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Promise-Unfulfilled-/146299/|accessdate=2014-08-09|agency=Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, Lhamon continued, "a college or university's appearance on this list and being the subject of a Title IX investigation in no way indicates at this stage that the college or university is violating or has violated the law."&lt;ref name=EDAnnounce/&gt;

There are critics of the list on both sides of campus anti-rape politics. Andrea Pino, a complainant against [[University of North Carolina|UNC-Chapel Hill]] and co-founder of [[End Rape on Campus]], told the Huffington Post that ""Announcing an investigation can open survivors to retaliation, and it's important that the OCR also take emphasis on providing survivors an option to opt out of having their investigation announced if it could endanger them, especially in small institutions where anonymity is less of an option."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingkade|first1=Tyler|title=55 Colleges Face Sexual Assault Investigations|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/01/college-sexual-assault_n_5247267.html|accessdate=10 October 2014|date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations like FIRE have argued that the OCR list—along with its precursor the [[Dear colleague letter]]—violates the rights to due process for both institutions and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=On Sexual Harassment and Title IX|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2011/08/30/on_sexual_harassment_and_title_ix_111065.html|accessdate=10 October 2014|date=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of the Legal systems of the world (en).png|thumb|Legal systems of the world]]
The contemporary '''legal systems of the world''' are generally based on one of four basic [[systems]]: [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[common law]], [[statutory law]], [[religious law]] or combinations of these. However, the legal system of each country is shaped by its unique history and so incorporates individual variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://saint-claire.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Legal-Systems-of-the-World.pdf|title=Legal Systems of the World|last=|first=|date= |website= |access-date=|publisher = Saint: Security Sector Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The science that studies Law at the level of legal systems is called [[Comparative Law]].

Both ''civil'' (also known as ''Roman'') and ''common'' law systems can be considered the most widespread in the world: civil law because it is the most widespread by landmass, and common law because it is employed by the greatest number of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Phillip|title=''Principles of International Insolvency''|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f_yWaV_-_l4C&amp;lpg=PT454&amp;ots=D-khdgPbR4&amp;dq=maps%20of%20world%20financial%20law%20common%20law&amp;pg=PT454#v=onepage&amp;q=maps%20of%20world%20financial%20law%20common%20law&amp;f=false|date=2007|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Phillip|title=''Maps of World Financial Law:Law and practice of international finance series''|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Maps_of_World_Financial_Law.html?id=Z5vKGAAACAAJ|date=2008|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''English Common Law is the most widespread legal system in the world''|url=https://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/about-us/press-releases/061108.pdf|date=November 2008|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
{{Main|Civil law (legal system)}}
[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Shamash]] (the [[Babylonia]]n sun god) hands King [[Hammurabi]] a [[Code of Hammurabi|code of law]]]]

The central source of law that is recognized as authoritative is [[Codification (law)|codifications]] in a constitution or [[statute]] passed by [[legislature]], to amend a code.
While the concept of codification dates back to the [[Code of Hammurabi]] in [[Babylon]] ca. 1790 BC, civil law systems derive from the [[Roman Empire]] and, more particularly, the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' issued by the Emperor [[Justinian]] ca. AD 529. This was an extensive reform of the law in the [[Byzantine Empire]], bringing it together into codified documents. Civil law was also partly influenced by [[religious law]]s such as [[Canon law]] and [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name=Badr&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 [Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, February 24–25, 1977]|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=J-Makdisi /&gt; Civil law today, in theory, is interpreted rather than developed or made by judges. Only [[legislature|legislative]] enactments (rather than legal [[precedent]]s, as in common law) are considered legally binding.

Scholars of [[comparative law]] and economists promoting the [[legal origins theory]] usually subdivide civil law into four distinct groups:
* '''French civil law''': in France, the [[Benelux]] countries, Italy, Romania, Spain and former colonies of those countries;
* '''[[Law of Germany#Civil law|German civil law]]''': in Germany, Austria, Russia, Switzerland, Estonia, Latvia,  Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo*, Macedonia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Serbia, Greece, [[Portugal]] and [[Portuguese Empire|its former colonies]], Turkey, and East Asian countries including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (Republic of China);
* '''[[Scandinavian law|Scandinavian civil law]]''': in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. As historically integrated in the Scandinavian cultural sphere, Finland and Iceland also inherited the system.
* '''[[Chinese law]]''': a mixture of civil law and [[socialist law]] in use in the People's Republic of China.

However, some of these legal systems are often and more correctly said to be of hybrid nature:
*'''Napoleonic to Germanistic influence ([[Italian law|Italian civil law]]) '''
The [[Italy|Italian]] civil code of 1942 replaced the original one of 1865, introducing germanistic elements due to the geopolitical alliances of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.teoriaestoriadeldirittoprivato.com/index.php?com=statics&amp;option=index&amp;cID=132 |title = Towards a Civil Code: The Italian Experience|last = Triggiano|first = Annalisa|website = Teoria e Storia del Diritto Privato}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian approach has been imitated by other countries including the [[Netherlands]] (1992), [[Argentina]] (2014), [[Brazil]] (2002) and [[Portugal]] (1966). Most of them have innovations introduced  by the Italian legislation, including the unification of the [[civil code|civil]] and [[Commercial code (law)|commercial code]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol16/iss2/8/ |title = On the Legal Method of the Uniform Commercial Code|journal = Law and Contemporary Problems|volume = 16|number = 2|first= Mitchell|last= Franklin|date = Spring 1951|pages = 330-343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Germanistic to Napoleonic influence ([[Swiss law|Swiss civil law]])'''
The [[Swiss civil code]] is considered mainly influenced by the German civil code and partly influenced by the French civil code.  The civil code of the [[Republic of Turkey]] is a slightly modified version of the Swiss code, adopted in 1926 during [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s presidency as part of the government's progressive reforms and secularization.

A comprehensive list of countries that base their legal system on a [[Codification (law)|codified]] civil law follows:

|The Spanish legal tradition had a great influence on the [[Civil Code of Argentina]], basically a work of the Argentine [[jurist]] [[Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield]], who dedicated five years of his life on this task. The Civil Code came into effect on 1 January 1871. Beyond the influence of the Spanish legal tradition, the Argentinian Civil Code was also inspired by the Draft of the Brazilian Civil Code, the [[wikt:Draft|Draft]] of the Spanish Civil Code of 1851, the [[Napoleonic code]] and the [[Civil Code (Chile)|Chilean Civil Code]]. The sources of this Civil Code also include various theoretical legal works, mainly of the great French jurists of the 19th century. It was the first Civil Law that consciously adopted as its cornerstone the distinction between i. rights from obligations and ii. real property rights, thus distancing itself from the French model.

The Argentinian Civil Code was also in effect in Paraguay, as per a [[Paraguayan]] law of 1880, until the new Civil Code went in force in 1987.

In Argentina, this 1871 Civil Code remained in force until August 2015, when it was replaced by the new ''Código Civil y Comercial de la Nación''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/235975/norma.htm |title=Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas Públicas - Argentina |publisher=InfoLEG |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial |title=Comienza a regir el nuevo Código Civil y Comercial |publisher=Jornadaonline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{flagicon|Chile}} [[Law of Chile|Chile]]
|Based on the Chilean Civil Law inspired by the Napoleonic Civil Law. The Spanish legal tradition exercised an especially great influence on the civil code of Chile. On its turn, the Chilean civil code influenced to a large degree the drafting of the civil codes of other [[Latin-American]] states. For instance, the codes of Ecuador (1861) and Colombia (1873) constituted faithful reproductions of the Chilean code, but for very few exceptions. The compiler of the [[Civil Code of Chile]], Venezuelan [[Andrés Bello]], worked for its completion for almost 30 years, using elements, of the Spanish law on the one hand, and of other [[Western law]]s, especially of the French one, on the other. Indeed, it is noted that he consulted and used all of the codes that had been issued till then, starting from the era of [[Justinian]].

The Civil Code came into effect on 1 January 1857. The influence of the [[Napoleonic code]] and the Law of Castile of the Spanish colonial period (especially the ''[[Siete Partidas]]''), is great; it is observed however that ''e.g.'' in many provisions of [[property law|property]] or [[contract law]], the solutions of the French ''code civil'' were put aside in favor of pure [[Roman law]] or Castilian law.

|Based on the Napoleonic Civil Law. First Civil Code (a part of the General Code or [[Braulio Carrillo Colina|Carrillo]] Code) came into effect in 1841; its text was inspired by the South Peruvian Civil Code of Marshal [[Andres de Santa Cruz]]. The present Civil Code went into effect 1 January 1888, and was influenced by the [[Napoleonic Code]] and the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 (from its 1851 draft version).
|-
|{{flagicon|Croatia}} [[Law of Croatia|Croatia]]
|Based on the Germanic Civil Law. Croatian Law system is largely influenced by German and  Austrian law systems. It is significantly influenced by the [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Civil Code of the Austrian Empire]] from 1811, known in Croatia as ''"General Civil Law"'' ''("Opći građanski zakon")''. OGZ was in force from 1853&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=45220 |title=Opći građanski zakonik &amp;#124; Hrvatska enciklopedija |publisher=Enciklopedija.hr |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1946. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-controlled [[puppet state]] that was established in 1941 during [[World War II]], used the OGZ as a basis for the 1943 ''"Base of the Civil Code for the Independent State of Croatia"'' ''("Osnova građanskoga zakona za Nezavisnu Državu Hrvatsku")''. After the War, Croatia become a member of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Federation]] which enacted in 1946 the ''"Law on immediate voiding of regulations passed before April 6, 1941 and during the enemy occupation"'' ''("Zakon o nevaženju pravnih propisa donesenih prije 6. travnja 1941. i za vrijeme neprijateljske okupacije")''. By this law OGZ was declared invalid as a whole, but implementation of some of its legal rules was approved. During the post-War era, the Croatian legal system become influenced by elements of the [[socialist law]]. Croatian civil law was pushed aside, and it took norms of public law and legal regulation of the [[Socialization (economics)|social ownership]]. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on June 25, 1991, the previous legal system was used as a base for writing new laws.  ''"The Law on Obligations"'' ''("Zakon o obveznim odnosima")'' was enacted in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Croatian legal history in the European context, Dalibor Čepulo, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Croatia as a [[European union]] member state implements elements of the [[Acquis communautaire|EU acquis]] into its legal system.

|-
|{{flagicon|Guatemala}} [[Law of Guatemala|Guatemala]]
|Based on Napoleonic civil law. Guatemala has had three Civil Codes: the first one from 1877, a new one introduced in 1933, and the one currently in force, which was passed in 1963. This Civil Code has suffered some reforms throughout the years, as well as a few derogations relating to areas which have subsequently been regulated by newer laws, such as the Code of Commerce and the Law of the National Registry of Persons. In general, it follows the tradition of the Roman-French system of civil codification.

Regarding the theory of 'sources of law' in the Guatemalan legal system, the 'Ley del Organismo Judicial' recognizes 'the law' as the main legal source (in the sense of legislative texts), although it also establishes 'jurisprudence' as a complementary source. Although jurisprudence technically refers to judicial decisions in general, in practice it tends to be confused and identified with the concept of 'legal doctrine', which is a qualified series of identical resolutions in similar cases pronounced by higher courts (the Constitutional Court acting as a 'Tribunal de [[Amparo (law)|Amparo]]', and the Supreme Court acting as a 'Tribunal de Casación') whose theses become binding for lower courts.

==Common law==
{{Main|Common law}}
[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|right|150px|King John of England signs [[Magna Carta]]]]
Common law and [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]] (legal concept) are systems of law whose sources are the decisions in cases by judges. In addition, every system will have a legislature that passes new laws and statutes. The relationships between statutes and judicial decisions can be complex. In some jurisdictions, such statutes may overrule judicial decisions or codify the topic covered by several contradictory or ambiguous decisions. In some jurisdictions, judicial decisions may decide whether the jurisdiction's constitution allowed a particular statute or statutory provision to be made or what meaning is contained within the statutory provisions. Statutes were allowed to be made by the government. Common law developed in England, influenced by [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] law and to a much lesser extent by the [[Norman conquest of England]], which introduced legal concepts from [[Norman law]], which, in turn, had its origins in [[Salic law]]. Common law was later inherited by the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and almost every former colony of the [[British Empire]] has adopted it ([[Malta]] being an exception). The doctrine of ''stare decisis'', also known as ''case law'' or ''[[precedent]] by courts'', is the major difference to codified civil law systems.

Common law is currently in practice in [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], most of the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] ([[English law|England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]]), [[Law of Australia|Australia]], [[Law of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], [[Law of India|India]] (excluding [[Goa civil code|Goa]]),{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed because the Supreme Court of India's decisions override many lower courts|date=June 2014}} [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Law of Canada|Canada]] (excluding [[Quebec law|Quebec]]), [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], the [[Law of the United States|United States]] (on a state level excluding [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]]), and many other places. In addition to these countries, several others have adapted the common law system into a mixed system. For example, Nigeria operates largely on a common law system, but incorporates religious law.

In the [[European Union]], the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] takes an approach mixing civil law (based on the treaties) with an attachment to the importance of case law. One of the most fundamental documents to shape common law is the English [[Magna Carta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html|accessdate=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which placed limits on the power of the English Kings. It served as a kind of medieval bill of rights for the aristocracy and the judiciary who developed the law.

==Religious law==
{{main|Religious law}}

Religious law refers to the notion of a religious system or document being used as a legal source, though the methodology used varies. For example, the use of Jewish and [[Halakha]] for public law has a static and unalterable quality, precluding amendment through legislative acts of government or development through judicial precedent; Christian [[Canon law]] is more similar to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in its use of [[code (law)|codes]]; and Islamic [[Sharia]] law (and [[Fiqh]] jurisprudence) is based on legal [[precedent]] and reasoning by [[analogy]] (''[[Qiyas]]''), and is thus considered similar to [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Finance: Law, Economics, and Practice|first=Mahmoud A.|last=El-Gamal|year=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-86414-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main kinds of religious law are [[Sharia]] in Islam, [[Halakha]] in Judaism, and [[canon law]] in some Christian groups. In some cases these are intended purely as individual moral guidance, whereas in other cases they are intended and may be used as the basis for a country's legal system. The latter was particularly common during the [[Middle Ages]].

[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Aleppo Codex: 10th century Hebrew Bible with Masoretic pointing]]
The Halakha is followed by [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|conservative]] Jews in both ecclesiastical and civil relations. No country is fully governed by Halakha, but two Jewish people may decide, because of personal belief, to have a dispute heard by a Jewish court, and be bound by its rulings.

The Islamic legal system of [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) and [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) is the most widely used [[religious law]], and one of the three most common legal systems in the world alongside common law and civil law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, 24–25 February 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on both [[divine law]], derived from the [[Qur'an and Sunnah]], and the rulings of [[Ulema]] (jurists), who used the methods of ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus), ''[[Qiyas]]'' (analogical deduction), ''[[Ijtihad]]'' (research) and ''[[Urf]]'' (common practice) to derive ''[[Fatwā]]'' (legal opinions). An Ulema was required to qualify for an ''[[Ijazah]]'' ([[Law degree|legal]] [[doctorate]]) at a ''[[Madrasa]]'' ([[law school]]/[[college]]) before they could issue ''Fatwā''.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April–June 1989|pages=175–182 [175–77]|doi=10.2307/604423}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], classical Islamic law may have had an [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|influence]] on the development of common law&lt;ref name=J-Makdisi&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=John A.|title=The Islamic Origins of the Common Law|journal=[[North Carolina Law Review]]|date=June 1999|volume=77|issue=5|pages=1635–1739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several civil law institutions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, 24–25 February 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharia law governs a number of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, though most countries use Sharia law only as a supplement to national law. It can relate to all aspects of civil law, including property rights, contracts or public law.

===Civil law and canon law===
{{main|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
[[Canon law]] is not divine law, properly speaking, because it is not found in revelation. Instead, it is seen as human law inspired by the word of God and applying the demands of that revelation to the actual situation of the church. [[Canon law]] regulates the internal ordering of the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]]. Canon law is amended and adapted by the legislative authority of the church, such as [[episcopal conference|councils of bishops]], individual bishops for their respective sees, the [[Pope]] for the entire Catholic Church, and the British Parliament for the [[Church of England]].

'''Music without sound''' can refer to music that falls outside the range of human hearing (typically 20&amp;nbsp;Hz–20&amp;nbsp;kHz) or to compositions, such as [[visual music]], that are analogous to or suggestive of conventional music but in media other than sound, such as color, shape, position, motion and literature (see Discursive music below). It is commonly taken for granted that music is wont to be performed or recorded, but some sound works simply won't fit on a disc or on stage, being either extremely discreet (like Robin Minard's ''Silent Music'') or incomplete (Varèse's Unfinished music). Additionally, silence can be regarded as the [[via negativa]] of music and has induced long lasting fascination to music composers of all kinds. A composer deals with the absence of sound as much as they deal with sounds. Therefore, this article includes several examples of [[apophasis]] in music (like Algorithmic music or Gesture Music). 
{{cquote|''"It seems to me that the most radical redefinition of music would be one that defines 'music' without reference to sound."''&lt;br /&gt;[[Robert Ashley]], 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Nyman, ''Experimental Music'', 1974, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Gesture music==
'''Sofia Gubaidulina'''&lt;br /&gt;
Silence in music happens when the music stops during a performance. It is sometimes replaced by gesture music. In his Sofia Gubaidulina biography,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kurtz ''Sofia Gubaidulina: A Biography'', p 184, english translation Indiana University Press, 2007 (written 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Kurtz mentions the ''silent solo performance by the conductor'' included in ''...Stimmenn... verstummen...'', an orchestral work from 1986.
{{cquote|''The symphony is notable for its careful and innovative use of silence. Though the eighth movement has the largest proportions of the work, the climax actually takes place in the ninth movement when the conductor motions before a silent orchestra. The motions the conductor makes are meant to make his hands move increasingly farther apart from each other according to the Fibonacci sequence. This "conductor solo" is repeated at the end of the work, when after the last note is sounded the conductor continues to motion for several minutes.''&lt;br /&gt;From Wikipedia [[Stimmen Verstummen|...Stimmenn... verstummen...]] article}}

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Knizak-snowstorm.jpg|right|thumb|Milan Knizak's 1965 Snowstorm N°1]] --&gt;
'''Milan Knizak'''&lt;br /&gt;
From 1960, the International [[Fluxus]] Movement created a number of Events or Verbal Pieces, whose temporal structures were typically vague so as to be sometimes without beginning nor end, with or without sound, with or without music. A remarkable example is that of Czech artist Milan Knizak's 1965 Snowstorm N°1 whose score states: ''Paper gliders are distributed to an idle and waiting audience.''
{{cquote|''Another Event, by Czech Fluxus artist Milan Knizak, is called Snowstorm N°1 (1965) and simply instructs that ‘Paper gliders are distributed to an idle and waiting audience’. What results is a snowstorm of quietly gliding paper airplanes as the audience returns them back and forth and so on. The exchange of sheets is experimentaly beautiful, like the caring gesture toward the instrument as tended by Brecht.''&lt;br /&gt;[From ''Not the Other Avant-garde''].&lt;ref&gt;James Martin Harding and John Rouse (editors) ''Not the Other Avant-Garde: The Transnational Foundations of Avant-Garde Performance'', University of Michigan Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-472-06931-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-472-06931-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;br /&gt;'''Helmut Lachenmann'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Lachenmann]] composed ''Salut Für Caldwell'' for 2 guitars in 1977. The piece includes silent moments when ''« the players silent motions and gestures created a space of unheard music »''
[Michael Kurtz&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kurtz ''Sofia Gubaidulina: A Biography'', p 192, english translation Indiana University Press, 2007 (written 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;]

&lt;br /&gt;'''Takehisa Kosugi'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 1963 [[Takehisa Kosugi]] composed for ''Fluxus 1'' a musical piece called ''Theatre Music'' in the form of a rectangle of cardstock that bore the trace of a spiral of moving feet. This was paired with the instructions: "Keep walking intently".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Mereweather ed., ''Art Anti-Art Non-Art'', Getty Research Institute, 2007, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;'''Juan María Solare'''&lt;br /&gt;
* His work ''[[Gestenstücke]]'' (2008) is a collection of five pieces for 4 performers in which a musical structure is used to put order in non-sounding elements, concretely gestures. For instance, the first piece of the cycle is a canon of gestures. Premiere: University Bremen, Ensemble Neues Musiktheater, June 12, 2008.
* Another non-sounding piece is his conceptual work called ''Tense Atmosphere'' a graphic score which consists of a silence with a sforzato sign (2013).

== Algorithmic music ==
[[File:Stadler -579180303.jpg|right|thumb|Maximilian Stadler (1748-1833)]]
''A sequence of finite instructions'' according to Wikipedia, an [[algorithm]] relates to computation, which ultimately relates to music. Eighteenth century algorithmic music is a contemporary of [[automaton]] machines, like [[Jacques de Vaucanson]]'s duck or [[Wolfgang von Kempelen]]'s chess player, or [[Ada Lovelace]] and [[Charles Babbage]]'s 1822 difference engine. In 1787, [[W.A. Mozart]] (1756–1791) devised an aleatoric system called ''[[Musikalisches Würfelspiel]]'' (''Musical Dice'')&lt;ref&gt;Musikalisches Würfelspiel (Musical Dice Game), K.516f in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart’s music&lt;/ref&gt; published 1793 by J.J. Hummel in Berlin-Amsterdam, to compose waltzes with a pair of dice and a set of written bars on paper cards.&lt;ref&gt;See Hideo Noguchi's [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~rb5h-ngc/e/k516f.htm article]: ''Mozart Musical Game in C K. 516f'', 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of all the 16 cards and transitions, of which there are theoretically &lt;math&gt;10^{29}&lt;/math&gt; combinations, constitutes a minuet.&lt;ref&gt;Computation from John Chuang in a 1995 [http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/Mozart/dice/ article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian composer Maximilian Johann Karl Dominik Stadler, also known as [[Maximilian Stadler]] (1748–1833), created a table to compose [[minuet]]s and trios with a pair of dice. In the case of the minuet version, there are 16 cards with one bar each and preconceived transitions between certain musical measures. Mathematical games columnist Martin Gardner once remarked in an article about automated music composition. ''"If you fail to preserve it, it will be a waltz that will probably never be heard again."''&lt;ref&gt;See Ivars Peterson's [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/1956/title/Mozarts_Melody_Machine article] ''Mozart's Melody Machine'' on Science News&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of pure [[aleatoric music]] was used in the twentieth century by US composer [[Lejaren Hiller]].

== The optophonic piano&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Opto-disc.jpg|right|thumb| Optophonic disc, paint on glass, diameter: 40cms, ca. 1920-24]] --&gt; ==
[[Wladimir Baranoff-Rossiné]]&lt;ref&gt;See Baranoff-Rossiné's official web [http://www.baranoffrossine.com/museum/optophonicpiano/ page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627175122/http://www.baranoffrossine.com/museum/optophonicpiano/ |date=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; started building his [[optophonic piano]] in the 1915s. A set of painted glass discs are rotated via the small keyboard. Light is projected through the discs onto the wall. The player can control intensity of light and speed of rotation. 6 or 8 keys of the 3-octaves keyboard are devoted to colored discs. It is not clear what kind of sound the keyboard is able to produce. Oscillator frequencies (as stated in some articles) are rather unlikely between 1915-1920. More probably the light show was performed with piano accompaniment, maybe performed on the reduced keyboard of the Optosonic Piano, akin to a toy piano.

== Unfinished/aborted music ==
At one point, the music exists in the composer's mind. In 1928, [[Edgar Varèse]] started working on an opera called ''L'Astronome'' based on North American Indian legends, a project he never completed and destroyed the drafts. In 1932, he asked [[Antonin Artaud]] to write the libretto of a large scale oratorio, ''Il n'ya plus de firmament'' (There is no longer any firmament). In his book ''Phantasmatic Radio'' '''Allen S. Weiss''' translates the beginning of Artaud's text:
{{cquote|''Darkness. Explosions in this darkness. Harmonies suddenly broken off. Harsh sounds. Depressurized soundings. The music will give the impression of a distant cataclysm and will fill the room, falling as from vertiginous heights. Chords will originate in the sky and then deteriorate, going from one extreme to the other. Sounds will fall as if from very high, then suddenly stop and spread out in bursts, forming vaults and parasols. Tiers of sounds...'' [in ''Phantasmatic Radio''&lt;ref&gt;Allen S. Weiss, ''Phantasmatic Radio'', Duke University Press, 1995, page 42&lt;/ref&gt;]}}
The piece was never completed and Varèse turned to other projects, including a radiophonic work involving various synchronised choirs located in different places of the world. He never found the technology for it. In 1948, Artaud insisted on having noise sounds included in his ''Pour en finir avec le judgement de Dieu'' (To have done with the judgment of God). This was done in the Radiodiffusion Television Française studios where [[Pierre Schaeffer]] was working at the time.

== Silent music ==
''Silent Music'' (1994)&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Schulz (editor) ''Silent Music - zwischen Klangkunst und Akustikdesign/Between Sound Art and Acoustic Design'', book+CD, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; is an installation work by Canadian artist [[Robin Minard]] (b1953) with several hundred wall-mounted piezo loudspeakers and four-channel audio. The miniature loudspeakers are displayed in plant-like shapes on the walls of public spaces. They reproduce the minuscule ambient sounds of the public space where they are installed or play random synthetic sounds at barely audible volume. Minard deals with remote sounds best suited to intimate listening. In 2006 he created 'A voir en silence', a small artist book with loudspeakers and hand-written text.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Meinhardt ''Silent Music/Adelaide Festival'' DVD, Australia, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discursive music ==
'''Marcel Proust'''&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Vinteuil Sonata]] (French: [[:fr:Sonate de Vinteuil|''Sonate de Vinteuil'']]) is an imaginary violin and piano sonata by fictitious composer Vinteuil recurring several times in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu'' (''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''), particularly in ''[[Un amour de Swann|Un Amour De Swann]]'' (1913). In the latter volume, Charles Swann associates strong emotions and memories to the melody composed by Vinteuil. The French composer [[Reynaldo Hahn]] noticed how much Marcel Proust ''"vivait la musique de son temps"'' (experienced contemporary music).&lt;ref&gt;See Adrien De Vries' [http://www.classiquenews.com/applaudir/lire_article.aspx?article=1012&amp;identifiant=20074159EEHR4OOD1ZQH7CEC61RFTMS8 article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205112508/http://www.classiquenews.com/applaudir/lire_article.aspx?article=1012&amp;identifiant=20074159EEHR4OOD1ZQH7CEC61RFTMS8 |date=2008-12-05 }}: ''Sources de la Sonate de Vinteuil'', April 2007 (in french)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Proust immediately praised and enjoyed [[Debussy]]'s 1902 ''[[Pelléas_et_Mélisande_(opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande ]]'' opera. Critics disagree on which composer inspired the Sonata. Possibly [[Gabriel Fauré]]&lt;ref&gt;See Margaret Hunter and Abigail Al-Doory's [http://www.french.pomona.edu/MSAIGAL/CLASSES/FR185/FALL96/aaldoory-mhunter/ article]: ''L'homme et la Musique Dans Un Amour de Swann'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; or [[César Franck]]. In [[:fr:Les Plaisirs et les Jours|Les Plaisirs et les Jours]] (1896), Proust focusses on [[Hans Sachs]]'s monologue from [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'', Act II. In ''[[Jean Santeuil]]'' (1952), a [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] Sonata for Violin and Piano (op. 75, 1885) plays a key role and is presumably the model for the Sonate de Vinteuil. In ''Un Amour De Swann'', the Vinteuil Sonata is played during evenings at the Verdurins' by pianist Dechambre. The main character's emotions are mirrored by Proust's musical reminiscences. 

'''Walter Marchetti'''
&lt;br /&gt;A good example of imaginary music can be found in a Walter Marchetti poem where he mentions a Juan Hidalgo imaginary composition (both Hidalgo and Marchetti were members of the Spanish [[Zaj]] Group of Madrid in the late 1950s).
{{cquote|''Eat an iced popsicle and thus perform his free''&lt;br /&gt;''transcription, for only one performer, of''&lt;br /&gt;'''''Music For Five Dogs, an iced'''''&lt;br /&gt;'''''Popsicle and Six Male Performers'''''&lt;br /&gt;''by Juan Hidalgo.''&lt;br /&gt;Walter Marchetti in ''A Zaj Sampler''&lt;ref&gt;Something Else Press, New York, 1967, reissued by Great Bear Pamphlets&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Israel Fund''' ('''NIF''') is a [[United States|U.S.]]-based non-profit organization established in 1979. It describes its objective as social justice and equality for all Israelis. The New Israel Fund says it has provided $300 million to over 900 Israeli civil society organizations that it describes as "cutting-edge."&lt;ref name="nif-faq"/&gt; It describes itself as active on the issues of civil and human rights, women's rights, religious status, human rights in the occupied territories, the rights of Israel's Arab minority, and freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nif.org/our-issues&lt;/ref&gt; The New Israel Fund is the largest foreign donor to progressive causes in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;"New Israel Fund may drop anti-Zionist donors" Sept 2, 2010 [https://www.thejc.com/news/world/new-israel-fund-may-drop-anti-zionist-donors-1.17782] &lt;/ref&gt;

Its financial support for [[Breaking the Silence (non-governmental organization)|Breaking the Silence]], [[Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel|Adalah]], [[B’Tselem]], [[Yesh Din]],  and other groups allegedly hostile to Zionist values has drawn criticism from many associated with Israel's political right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sokol|first1=Sam|title=Birthright Israel cuts ties with New Israel Fund|date=November 28, 2014|access-date=October 7, 2016|newspaper=[[Jerusalem Post]]|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Birthright-Israel-cuts-ties-with-New-Israel-Fund-383088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology ==
NIF describes itself as "the leading organization committed to democratic change within Israel".&lt;ref name="nif-about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nif.org/about/wearenif |title=We Are NIF |publisher=New Israel Fund |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118084930/http://www.nif.org/about/wearenif |archivedate=18 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated objective is "to actualize the vision of Israel's Founders, that of a Jewish and democratic state that, in the words of the Declaration of Independence, 'ensures complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="nif-faq"/&gt; It views Israel as "the sovereign expression of the right of self-determination of the Jewish people and as a democracy dedicated to the full equality of all its citizens and communities".&lt;ref name="nif-principles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nif.org/about/new-israel-fund-principles |title=New Israel Fund Principles |publisher=New Israel Fund |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528072709/http://www.nif.org/about/new-israel-fund-principles |archivedate=28 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It advocates for [[Civil rights|civil]] and human rights, [[Religious toleration|religious tolerance]] and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]], and closing the [[Social inequality|social]] and [[Economic inequality|economic gaps]] in Israeli society, especially those among Jews and Arabs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

''The New York Times'' wrote that NIF "advocates for equality and democracy" in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/world/middleeast/israel-faces-crisis-over-role-of-ultra-orthodox-in-society.html|title=Israel Faces Crisis Over Role of Ultra-Orthodox in Society|last=Bronner|first=Ethan |authorlink=Ethan Bronner |date=2012-01-14|last2=Kershner|first2=Isabel |author2link=Isabel Kershner |newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' has also reported that the organization funds "Arab-run, non-Zionist groups" without necessarily agreeing with all the positions of those groups, but rather out of support for their right to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli Rights Groups View Themselves as Under Siege|first1=Isabel|last1=Kershner  |authorlink=Isabel Kershner |date=April 5, 2010|access-date=October 12, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/world/middleeast/06israel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Sokatch]], CEO, says that in line with their "core values of democracy and equality, we support two states for two peoples and we oppose the occupation and the settlement enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Daniel Sokatch]] |date=16 May 2012 |newspaper=The Australian Jewish News |url=http://www.jewishnews.net.au/nif-in-the-hot-seat/26146 |title=NIF In the Hot Seat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, NIF marched with a "progressive cluster" in the New York Celebrate Israel parade; the cluster included [[Ameinu]], [[Americans for Peace Now]], [[B'Tselem]] USA, [[Partners for Progressive Israel]], and [[Rabbis for Human Rights-North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=17 May 2012 |url=http://www.nif.org/news-media/press-releases/new-israel-fund-with-more-partners-will-march-again-in-new-yorks-annual-celebrate-israel-parade/ |title=New Israel Fund, With More Partners, will March Again in New York's Annual 'Celebrate Israel' Parade |publisher=New Israel Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The New Israel Fund is a registered [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] organization in the United States. The New Israel Fund's headquarters are located in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="nif-faq"/&gt; The New Israel Fund also has offices in [[Jerusalem]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Miami]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Toronto]], [[London]], and [[Basel]].&lt;ref name="nifContact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nif.org/about/contact/ |title=Contact |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
In October 2009, Daniel Sokatch became the new chief [[executive officer]] of the New Israel Fund, after working as the [[executive director]] of the [[Progressive Jewish Alliance]] and the [[San Francisco]] [[Jewish Federation]].

Rachel Liel, formerly director of Shatil, became Israel [[Executive Director]] on 1 November 2009.

[[Rabbi]] [[Brian Lurie]], former executive director of the San Francisco Federation and [[executive vice president]] of the UJA, was the [[chairman|chair]] of NIF's [[board of directors]], following the term of [[Naomi Chazan]], former deputy speaker of the [[Israeli Knesset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Chemi Shalev]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/new-nif-head-brian-lurie-the-occupation-is-a-cancer-that-is-eating-us.premium-1.455599 |title=New NIF head Brian Lurie: 'The occupation is a cancer that is eating us' |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorney Talia Sasson, best known for her authorship of the [[Sasson Report|report detailing Israeli government support of illegal settlements]], succeeded Rabbi Lurie as NIF [[President (corporate title)|president]] in June 2015.&lt;ref name=Guttman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forward.com/articles/205958/new-israel-fund-shifts-cash-in-push-for-progressiv |title=New Israel Fund Shifts Cash in Push for Progressive Politics |first=Nathan |last=Guttman |date=18 September 2014 |work=[[The Forward]] |accessdate=29 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The board consists of 21 community leaders, activists, academics and philanthropists from the United States, Israel, Canada and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Board of Directors"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nif.org/about/people/ |title=People |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other board members include law professor [[Peter Edelman]], economist [[Franklin Fisher]], and Bedouin scholar [[Amal ElSana Alhjooj]].&lt;ref name="Board of Directors"/&gt; International Council members include Israeli novelist [[Amos Oz]], Nobel Prize winner [[Aaron Ciechanover]], former Deputy Attorney General Judith Karp, former Knesset Speaker [[Avram Burg]], and [[Michael Walzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nif.org/about/people/international-council-members/ |title=International Council Members |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Grantmaking===
In 2014, NIF contributed about US$24 million to groups in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nif.org/about/financials/ |title=2014 Annual Report |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, NIF published guidelines defining who is eligible to receive its grants on its website for the first time.&lt;ref name="jp2010-09-20"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=188620 |title=NIF denies plans to change funding policies |last=Shefler |first=Gil |date=20 September 2010 |work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nif-guidelines"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nif.org/about/funding-guidelines/ |title=Funding Guidelines |date=September 2010 |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naomi Paiss, NIF's vice president of public affairs, says that it is the actions of grantee organizations that are looked at to determine whether they qualify for funding, and not the personal views of individuals involved. In her words, NIF "won't support organizations working to deny the Jewish people's right to sovereign self-determination". She explains that it is not relevant whether the "leaders of (Israeli-)Arab organizations prefer a multinational, multicultural state" so long as the work by the grantees is not "designed to change the State of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=14 February 2014 |author=Yonah Jeremy Bob |title=A big and sometimes tumultuous tent |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/A-big-and-sometimes-tumultuous-tent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== NGOs ====

In 2014 NIF had a budget of $31,057,80, and awarded $14.7 million in grants to grantees including [[Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel|Adalah]], [[B'Tselem]], [[Breaking the Silence (non-governmental organization)|Breaking the Silence]], [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]], the Council for Peace and Security, [[Molad: The Center for the Renewal of Israeli Democracy]], [[Mossawa Center]] and [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]; in addition, NIF directs "donor advised" grants in which supporters make gifts directly to NGOs on advice from NIF grant experts.&lt;ref name=Grants2014&gt;{{cite news|title=NIF Grants – 2014|url=http://ngo-monitor.org/article/changes_in_nif_grants_few_changes_in_demonization_funding |publisher=[[NGO Monitor]] |date=20 August 2015 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2014 Grantees |publisher=New Israel Fund |url=http://www.nif.org/what-we-do/grantmaking/grantees/2014-grantees/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel-US Civil Liberties Law Program===
The New Israel Fund has trained more than 46 Israeli lawyers over the course of 20 years in human rights law. The lawyers are provided with the opportunity to get a [[LLM]] degree at the [[American University]] [[Washington College of Law]] specializing in human rights law. Graduates of the program have successfully argued cases in Israel around social justice, for environmental protections, to curb police brutality, and against discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Quiet Revolution |author=Yuval Yoaz |date=25 May 2004 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/the-quiet-revolution-1.123451 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Initiatives For Democracy===
In September 2014, the New Israel Fund announced a new initiative, New Initiatives for Democracy (NIF-D), that will provide for the seed-funding, partnering and incubation of new programs to construct the missing architecture for the progressive movement in Israel, as well as building bridges to non-progressive constituencies who share values and interests. Initial funding stood at more than $2 million in 2014, granted or seed-funded to eight new initiatives, from think tanks to media monitoring to online engagement and leadership training.&lt;ref name=Guttman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nif.org/what-we-do/new-initiatives-for-democracy |title=New Initiatives for Democracy |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=29 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The New Israel Fund was established in 1979 in California,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-the-right-needs-an-enemy-its-a-tactic-of-intimidation-1001201886 The right needs an enemy. It's a tactic of intimidation.] 20 Aug, 2017, Renen Netzer, Globes&lt;/ref&gt;  and is credited with seed-funding "almost every significant cause-related progressive NGO in Israel".&lt;ref name="nif-faq"/&gt; Since its inception the fund has provided over US $250 million to more than 900 organizations.&lt;ref name="nif-faq"/&gt; NIF states that while its position is that "Israel is and must be a Jewish and democratic state" it says it was "among the first organizations to see that civil, human and economic rights for Israeli Arabs is an issue crucial to the long-term survival of the state".&lt;ref name="nif-pi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nif.org/issue-areas/israeli-arabs |title=The Paradox of Ethnicity and Citizenship |publisher=New Israel Fund |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101194826/http://nif.org/issue-areas/israeli-arabs |archivedate=1 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender segregation and women's rights===
In 1994, a pair of NIF grantees successfully petitioned the Israeli High Court of Justice to force the Israeli military to stop discriminating on the basis of gender when it came to allowing women to qualify for flight training. The decision, known as the [[Alice Miller (pilot)|Alice Miller]] case, opened the door for women to serve in many combat roles within the Israeli army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alice Miller Chosen to Light Independence Day Torch |date=23 April 2015 |publisher=New Israel Fund |url=http://www.nif.org/stories/our-issues/social-and-economic-justice/alice-miller-chosen-to-light-independence-day-torch/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bettylu K.

In January 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] ruled that publicly-funded buses cannot enforce a policy of gender segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/israeli-freedom-riders-ensure-womens-place-at-front-of-the-bus/2011/07/14/gIQAYSakGI_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Jenna | last=Johnson | date=15 July 2011 | title=Israeli 'Freedom Riders' ensure women's place at front of the bus}}&lt;/ref&gt; IRAC, a grantee of NIF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issuu.com/newisraelfund/docs/2010_annual_report/1 |title=2010 Annual Report |date=7 September 2011 |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiated the legal efforts to integrate the bus lines. NIF-backed efforts against gender segregation in public spaces included a Chanukah candle-lighting to protest gender segregation at the Western Wall plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nif.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=524 |title=Chanukah Candle-Lighting at Western Wall Protests Gender-Segregation |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407214618/http://www.nif.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=524 |archivedate=7 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, in response the disappearance of the images of women from advertisements in Jerusalem because of Haredi pressure, NIF launched the "Women Should be Seen and Heard" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/world/middleeast/israel-faces-crisis-over-role-of-ultra-orthodox-in-society.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Ethan | last1=Bronner |authorlink=Ethan Bronner | first2=Isabel | last2=Kershner |author2link=Isabel Kershner | title=Israel Faces Crisis Over Role of Ultra-Orthodox in Society | date=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In winter 2012, NIF convened "30 social justice organizations" who put pressure on organizers of a fertility and gynecology conference from which women were banned from speaking, and that "nine out of ten Israeli doctors scheduled to speak had withdrawn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.forward.com/sisterhood-blog/149359/women-only-fertility-conference-is-no-answer/ |title=Women-Only Fertility Conference Is No Answer |last1=Sztokman |first1=Elana |date=10 January 2012 |newspaper=[[The Forward]] |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NIF also supports [[Women of the Wall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jodi Rudoren |date=11 March 2013 |title=Standoff at Western Wall Over Praying by Women |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/middleeast/3-ultra-orthodox-men-arrested-in-western-wall-standoff.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which fights for egalitarian prayer at the [[Western Wall]], Judaism's holiest site.

===Social justice protests===
In the summer of 2011, as hundreds of thousands of Israelis protested  for social justice, NIF reportedly raised $35,000 on behalf of the demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/141891/ |title=New Israel Fund Alone in Funding Israel Protests |last=Guttman |first=Nathan |date=26 August 2011 |newspaper=[[The Forward]] |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NIF praised the [[2011 Israeli social justice protests|social justice protest]] as an autonomous, grassroots movement. It said its own participation was limited in scope, which included providing tens of thousands of dollars in small grants to activist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Israel Fund Alone in Funding Israel Protests |first=Nathan |last=Guttman |url=http://forward.com/articles/141891/new-israel-fund-alone-in-funding-israel-protests/ |newspaper=[[The Forward]] |date=2 September 2011 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also acknowledged other activities, including "mapping the initiatives, which were initiated by Shatil and the New Israel Fund" and in terms of providing advice to the protesters and providing funding for the tent cities in the periphery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Israel Fund Comes Clean on Role in Tent Protests |url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/new-israel-fund-comes-clean-on-role-in-tent-protests/2012/01/17/ |newspaper=[[The Jewish Press]] |date=17 January 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nif.org/component/content/article/13-stories/1176-a-letter-from-shatil-director-ronit-heyd |title=A Letter from SHATIL Director Ronit Heyd |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127120040/http://nif.org/component/content/article/13-stories/1176-a-letter-from-shatil-director-ronit-heyd |archivedate=27 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NIF also organized a petition signed by nearly 4,000 people in support of the protesters. The petition was published in the Israeli edition of the ''International Herald Tribune''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nif.org/issue-areas/component/content/article/12-general/1184-full-page-nif-ad-in-iht-israel-edition |title=Full-Page NIF Ad in IHT Israel Edition |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503133338/http://www.nif.org/issue-areas/component/content/article/12-general/1184-full-page-nif-ad-in-iht-israel-edition |archivedate=3 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wikileaks===
A leaked U.S. government cable revealed that a former NIF staff person hypothesized that in 100 years Israel would be majority Arab and said that this change would not be the tragedy that Israelis fear since it would become more democratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Noah Pollak]] |date=6 September 2011 |title=Wikileaks Bombshell: New Israel Fund Official Endorses End of Jewish State |work=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]] |url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/2011/09/06/wikileaks-new-israel-fund-endorses-end-of-jewish-state/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Israel Fund said that this individual left the organization because her personal views diverged from the organization's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=NIF Statement: Wikileaks and Anti-Democratic Legislation |date=6 September 2011 |publisher=New Israel Fund |url=http://www.nif.org/news-media/press-releases/nif-statement-wikileaks-and-anti-democratic-legislation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BDS===
NIF is opposed to the global [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) campaign.&lt;ref name="paiss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Naomi Paiss |date=16 March 2012 |publisher=[[The Daily Beast]] |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/16/a-leftist-s-critique-of-bds.html |title=A Leftist Critique of BDS}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has stated that it does not support global BDS and will not support organizations with BDS programs but that its policy allows NIF the discretion to "engage in dialogue with an important organization that signs one letter supporting divestment rather than summarily dismissing them".&lt;ref name="goldberg"&gt;{{cite news |title=The New Israel Fund, Dipping Its Toe Into the BDS Swamp |first=Jeffrey |last=Goldberg |authorlink=Jeffrey Goldberg |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/11/the-new-israel-fund-dipping-its-toe-into-the-bds-swamp/66699/ |work=The Atlantic |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naomi Paiss, Director of Communications, described the campaign as "a tactic that embodies the message that Israel cannot and will not change itself, and for that reason, we think it is inflammatory and counter-productive".&lt;ref name="paiss"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zeek.forward.com/articles/117036/ |title=Don't Divest; Invest |last=Paiss |first=Naomi |date=28 October 2010 |work=ZEEK |accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the NIF states that it will "not exclude support for organizations that lawfully discourage the purchase of goods or use of services from settlements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is NIF’s position on boycott, divestment and sanctions?|url=https://www.nif.org/about/selected-policies/|website=New Israel Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture ban===
In 1999, the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] ruled that the Israel Security Agency, also known as [[Shin Bet]], could no longer use various means of physical torture in its interrogations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 September 1999 |author=Rebecca Trounson |title=Israeli Court Bans Torture in Interrogations |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/07/news/mn-7626}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was brought to the court by three NIF grantees: [[Public Committee Against Torture in Israel]], [[HaMoked]], and [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HCJ 5100/94 - Public Committee Against Torture in Israel et al. v. The State of Israel et al.

However, some of the groups who brought the case to the court say that some forms of torture continue to be practiced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=6 January 2014 |author=Yonah Jeremy Bob |title=Israeli rights group accuses Shin Bet of using torture despite High Court ban |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Israeli-NGO-accuses-Shin-Bet-of-using-torture-despite-High-Court-ban-337196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Josh Nathan-Kazis |author2=Nathan Guttman |date=20 January 2015 |title=Two Countries, Two Paths on Torture |newspaper=[[The Forward]] |url=http://forward.com/news/israel/212351/two-countries-two-paths-on-torture/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ford Foundation funding===
In 2003 and 2008, the [[Ford Foundation]] provided five-year grants worth $20 million each to NGOs in Israel through the New Israel Fund. The foundation was the focus of criticism because most of its donees are liberal. The foundation adopted new, stricter funding guidelines after the [[World Conference against Racism 2001|World Conference against Racism]] in Durban in 2001. At the beginning of the second five-year grant, the Ford Foundation said it would not renew its grants to Israeli NGOs, which had provided roughly one-third of the New Israel Fund's donor-advised giving, citing its policy of creating sustainable funding, which is also being applied to much of its NGO funding worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://forward.com/articles/136816/ |title=Ford Foundation, Big Funder of Israeli NGOs, Pulling Out |last=Guttman |first=Nathan |date=6 April 2011 |work=[[The Forward]] |accessdate=9 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birthright===
In November 2014 [[Birthright Israel]] cancelled a planned trip the two groups had been collaborating on. According to Stephanie Ives, the NIF's New York director, Birthright had provided three reasons: Birthright said the NIF had violated its marketing guidelines, Birthright said it does not work with organizations that seek to influence Israeli policy, and Birthright was cancelling several trips from the New York area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sam Sokol |date=28 November 2014 |title=Birthright Israel cuts ties with New Israel Fund |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Birthright-Israel-cuts-ties-with-New-Israel-Fund-383088}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Birthright Israel Terminates Partnership With Controversial New Israel Fund |date=26 November 2014 |newspaper=[[Algemeiner Journal]] |url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/11/26/birthright-israel-terminates-partnership-with-controversial-new-israel-fund/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism ==

=== Pamela Geller ===

[[Pamela Geller]] has put pressure on some of the New Israel Fund's donors to stop funding the group because she says the organization is anti-Israel. Geller says the New Israel Fund "are leftists aligned with the jihad force" and that they are "21st century kapos, but worse". She announced a national advertising effort to place the names of donors in ads on transit systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moving on From Attacking Islam, Pamela Geller Sponsors N.Y.C. Bus Ads Against New Israel Fund Donors |author=Debra Nussbaum Cohen |date=11 March 2015 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.646449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anatomy of a Smear |author=[[Jane Eisner]] |date=10 March 2015 |newspaper=[[The Forward]] |url=http://forward.com/opinion/editorial/216301/anatomy-of-a-smear/}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts were criticized by [[Deborah Lipstadt]] and Rabbi [[David Ellenson]], who wrote in ''[[The Forward]]'' that the campaign amounts to [[McCarthyism]]. They also wrote, "it is simply wrong to question the commitment and loyalty of this organization and its supporters to the Jewish state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=13 March 2015 |author=[[Deborah Lipstadt]] |author2=[[David Ellenson]] |title=Echoes of McCarthyism in Smear Campaign Against New Israel Fund Backers |newspaper=[[The Forward]] |url=http://forward.com/opinion/216599/echoes-of-mccarthyism-in-smear-campaign-against-ne/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Im Tirtzu===

In January 2010, [[Im Tirtzu]] placed newspaper advertisements depicting then-NIF President Naomi Chazan with a horn sprouting from her forehead (as a pun, since both the words "horn" and "fund" use the same Hebrew word "Keren") as part of a campaign accusing NIF of responsibility for the [[Goldstone Report]]. Im Tirtzu alleged that 92% of all Israel-based negative reporting in the Goldstone report came from NIF-supported groups.&lt;ref name="jta1"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.jta.org/2010/02/10/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/breaking-down-the-im-tirtzu-report-on-new-israel-fund |title = Breaking down the Im Tirtzu report on New Israel Fund |last=Kampeas |first= Ron |authorlink=Ron Kampeas |date= 9 February 2010 |publisher = JTA |accessdate =5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Im Tirtzu's campaign drew criticism. [[Abe Foxman]], head of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] said that it was "absurd to blame Goldstone on the NIF."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Knesset Slimers Retreat After Foxman Slams Defamation of New Israel Fund |author=[[J.J. Goldberg]] |date=February 5, 2010 |newspaper=The Forward |url=http://forward.com/opinion/125089/knesset-slimers-retreat-after-foxman-slams-defamat/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gershon Baskin]], writing in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', accused Im Tirtzu of using an "anti-Semitic motif" as part of a "witch-hunt" that "is reminiscent of the darkest days of McCarthyism".&lt;ref name=jp-dark&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Article.aspx?ID=168195|title=A dark day for democracy |last=Baskin |first=Gershon |authorlink=Gershon Baskin |date=9 February 2010 |work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jp-cufi&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=167666 |title=Christians fume over ad showing Chazan wearing horn|date=3 February 2010|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] (JTA) Im Tirtzu's report said 16 NIF affiliated groups comprised 14 percent of all sources for the Goldstone report, while stating in a separate section that these constitute 92 percent of Israel-based negative reporting in the Goldstone report; some reporting had incorrectly confused the two separate figures and accused Im Tirzu as being inaccurate.&lt;ref name="jta1"/&gt;

NIF estimated that 1.3% of the citations in the UN report originated from reports by organizations supported by the New Israel Fund.&lt;ref name="nifAnalysis"&gt;{{cite web |date=11 February 2010 |url=http://www.nif.org/media-center/under-attack/lies-damn-lies-and-the-im.html|title=Lies, Damn Lies, and the Im Tirtzu Report - Analysis of the Im Tirtzu Report on the New Israel Fund |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chemi Shalev]], writing for ''[[Haaretz]]'', defended the NIF, writing "one cannot really overstate what an utter travesty this fanatic jihad against the NIF was".&lt;ref name=Shalev&gt;{{cite news |title=An evening in New York with the enemies of the state |first=Chemi |last=Shalev |authorlink=Chemi Shalev |url=http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/west-of-eden/an-evening-in-new-york-with-the-enemies-of-the-state-1.394034 |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=6 November 2011 |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benjamin Netanyahu===
In April 2018 Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] blamed the New Israel Fund for undermining an agreement he said he had reached with the government of Rwanda to have that country accept migrants deported from Israel. The Rwandan government denied that such an agreement ever existed. NIF also denied Netanyahu's allegation, although it was later reported that five NIF grantees sent a letter to Rwandan President Paul Kagame asking him not to accept the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEW ISRAEL FUND GRANTEES ASKED RWANDAN GOVERNMENT NOT TO ACCEPT MIGRANTS|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/New-Israel-Fund-grantees-asked-Rwandan-government-not-to-accept-migrants-549124|website=Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The organization's CEO said that NIF "did support massive numbers of Israelis standing up for what is right and demanding action from their own government." Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel [[Martin Indyk]] termed Netanyahu's statements as  "Bibiesque/Trump-style deflection" and said that "Israelis are smarter than to believe such hogwash." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.jta.org/2018/04/04/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/why-netanyahu-is-blaming-this-organization-for-israels-migrant-crisis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/pm-pins-deportation-failure-on-new-israel-fund-demands-knesset-probe/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Netanyahu-New-Israel-Fund-hostile-to-Israel-killed-Rwanda-migrant-plan-547802&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Non bis in idem''''', which translates literally from [[Latin]] as "not twice in the same [thing]", is a legal doctrine to the effect that no legal action can be instituted twice for the same cause of action. It is a legal concept originating in [[Roman law|Roman civil law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckland|first=W.W.|title=A Text-book of Roman Law from Augustus to Justinian|edition=3|date=1963|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge UP| pages=695–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is essentially the equivalent of the [[double jeopardy]] (''autrefois acquit'') doctrine found in [[common law]] jurisdictions.

The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] guarantees the right to be free from double jeopardy; however, it does not apply to prosecutions by two different sovereigns&lt;ref&gt;For example, see A.P. v Italy, UN HRC CCPR/C/31/D/204/1986&lt;/ref&gt; (unless the relevant [[extradition treaty]] expresses a prohibition). The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] creates a different form of ''non bis in idem''.

==  Rome Statute and ''ad hoc'' UN tribunals ==

The [[Rome Statute]] establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC) states that the ''non bis in idem'' principle has a peculiar meaning, especially in comparison to European supranational law. The ICC jurisdiction is complementary to national law, and Article 20 of the Rome Statute specifies that even if the principle remains in general terms, it cannot be taken in consideration if there is unwillingness or incapability of the existence of the supranational court's jurisdiction.
Article 10 of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] Statute and Article 9 of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda|ICTR]] Statute both state that the principle can be enforced mainly to clarify that the ''ad hoc'' tribunal's sentences are "stronger" than the ones in domestic courts.

In other words, national courts cannot proceed against the responsible parties of crimes within the tribunal's jurisdiction if the international tribunal has already pronounced sentence for the same crimes.  However, the ICTY and the ICTR can judge alleged criminals already sentenced by national courts if both of the following occur:
*the sentence defined the crimes as "ordinary".
*the judiciary of the state is not considered impartial or the domestic trial is considered to be a pretense to protect the accused from the legal action of international justice or is considered to be unfair on some fundamental legal basis.

In [[computer science]],  in an object-oriented program, groups of objects form a network through their relationships with each other—either through a direct reference to another object or through a chain of intermediate references. These groups of objects are referred to as object graphs.

An '''object graph''' is a view of an [[object system]] at a particular point in time. Whereas a normal [[data model]] such as a [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[class diagram]] details the relationships between classes, the object graph relates their instances. [[Object diagram]]s are subsets of the overall object graph.

Object-oriented applications contain complex webs of interrelated objects. Objects are linked to each other by one object either owning or containing another object or holding a reference to another object. This web of objects is called an object graph and it is the more abstract structure that can be used in discussing an application's state.

==Physical representation==
An object graph is a [[directed graph]], which might be [[Cycle graph|cyclic]]. When stored in [[Random access memory|RAM]], objects occupy different segments of the memory with their attributes and function table, while relationships are represented by [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s or a different type of global handler in higher-level languages.

==Examples==
For instance, a Car class can compose a Wheel one. In the object graph a Car instance will have up to four links to its wheels, which can be named frontLeft, frontRight, backLeft and backRight.
Example of an [[adjacency list]] representation: c:Car → {frontLeft:Wheel, frontRight:Wheel, backLeft:Wheel, backRight:Wheel}.

In [[quantum mechanics]], "observation" is synonymous with [[quantum measurement]] and "observer" with a measurement apparatus and "[[observable]]" with what can be measured. Thus the quantum mechanical observer does not have to
''necessarily'' present or solve any problems over and above the issue of [[measurement in quantum mechanics]]. The quantum mechanical observer is also intimately tied to the issue of [[Observer effect (physics)#Quantum mechanics|observer effect]].

A number of new-age religious or philosophical [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]], notably "[[consciousness causes collapse]]",  give the observer a special role, or place constraints on who or what can be an observer. There is no credible peer-reviewed research that backs such claims.

      <comment>Linked to motivational crowding theory</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25132">The '''overjustification effect''' occurs when an expected external [[wikt:incentive|incentive]] such as money or prizes decreases a person's [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic motivation]] to perform a task. Overjustification is an explanation for the phenomenon known as [[Motivation crowding theory|motivational "crowding out."]] The overall effect of offering a reward for a previously unrewarded activity is a shift to extrinsic motivation and the undermining of pre-existing intrinsic motivation. Once rewards are no longer offered, interest in the activity is lost; prior intrinsic motivation does not return, and extrinsic rewards must be continuously offered as motivation to sustain the activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carlson, R.Neil  |author2=Heth, C. Donald |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title=Psychology the Science of Behaviour|publisher=Pearson Education:New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental evidence==
The overjustification effect has been widely demonstrated in many settings. In one of the earliest demonstrations of this effect, [[Edward Deci]] and his colleagues conducted a laboratory experiment in 1971 where subjects showing [[wikt:baseline|baseline]] interest in solving a puzzle were exposed to two different conditions. The [[control group]] were not paid on all three days while the [[experimental group]] were not paid on the first day, were paid on the second day and were not paid again on the third day. The subjects were given a break in the middle of each session and were being observed while doing whatever they wanted. The results showed that the experimental group spent significantly more time than the control group playing the puzzle during their break time on day 2 when they were paid but significantly less on day 3 when they were not paid. This was interpreted as evidence that the extrinsic monetary [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] significantly reduced their [[intrinsic motivation]] to engage in the task.&lt;ref name="Lepper 1973 129–137"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lepper|first=M.P|author2=Greene, D. |author3=Nisbett, R. E |title=Undermining children's Intrinsic interest with extrinsic reward: A test of the "overjustification" hypothesis|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1973|volume=28|issue=1|pages=129–137|url=http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Motivation/Lepper_et_al_Undermining_Childrens_Intrinsic_Interest.pdf|doi=10.1037/h0035519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at [[Southern Methodist University]] conducted an experiment on 188 female university students in which they measured the subjects' continued interest in a cognitive task (a word game) after their initial performance under different incentives. The subjects were divided into two groups. Members of the first group were told that they would be rewarded for competence. Above-average players would be paid more and below-average players would be paid less. Members of the second group were told that they would be rewarded only for completion. Their pay was scaled by the number of repetitions or the number of hours playing. Afterwards, half of the subjects in each group were told that they over-performed, and the other half were told that they under-performed, regardless of how well each subject actually did. Members of the first group generally showed greater interest in the game and continued playing for a longer time than the members of the second group. "Over-performers" continued playing longer than "under-performers" in the first group, but "under-performers" continued playing longer than "over-performers" in the second group. This study showed that, when rewards do not reflect competence, higher rewards lead to less intrinsic motivation. But when rewards do reflect competence, higher rewards lead to greater intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenfield |first=D. |last2=Folger |first2=R. |last3=Adelman |first3=H. F. |year=1980 |title=When rewards reflect competence: A qualification of the overjustification effect |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=368–376 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.3.368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Titmuss]] suggested that paying for [[blood donations]] might reduce the supply of blood donors. To test this, a [[field experiment]] with three treatments was conducted. In the first treatment, the donors did not receive compensation. In the second treatment, the donors received a small payment. In the third treatment, donors were given a choice between the payment and an equivalent-valued contribution to [[Charitable organization|charity]]. None of the three treatments affected the number of male donors, but the second treatment almost halved the number of female donors. However, allowing the contribution to charity fully eliminated this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mellstrom|first=Carl|author2=Magnus Johannesson|title=Crowding out in blood donation: Was Titmuss right?|journal=Journal of the European Economic Association|year=2008|volume=6|issue=4|pages=845–863|doi=10.1162/JEEA.2008.6.4.845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
According to [[self-perception theory]], a person infers causes about his or her own behavior based on external constraints. The presence of a strong constraint (such as a reward) would lead a person to conclude that he or she is performing the behavior solely for the reward, which shifts the person's motivation from intrinsic to extrinsic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |first=E. |last2=Akert |first2=R. D. |last3=Wilson |first3=T. D. |year=2006 |title=Social psychology |edition=6th |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory studies in the 1970s indicated that individuals under conditions with extrinsic rewards showed diminished intrinsic motivation. Deci and his colleagues (e.g., Deci and Ryan 1985) developed the [[cognitive evaluation theory]] to explain the results. As a sub-theory of [[self-determination theory]], cognitive evaluation theory explains that both control and competence underlie intrinsic motivation and how extrinsic rewards affect intrinsic motivation is dependent on the individual's interpretation. Intrinsic motivation increases if individuals interpret rewards as pertaining positive information about their own competence and self-control over results, whereas if they interpret the results as indicative of external control, this decreases their feelings of self-control and competence, which in turn decreases intrinsic motivation. Cognitive evaluation theory also suggests social context as another implication on intrinsic motivation. Social cues can exert either positive or negative effects on intrinsic motivation depending on the messages that the context conveys regarding a person's autonomy and competence. Verbal rewards such as positive feedback and praise are predicted to be experienced as controlling hence decreasing intrinsic motivation. However, verbal rewards that are informational and not experienced as controlling are predicted to exert positive effects.&lt;ref name="Deci 1999 627–668"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deci|first=E.L.|author2=Koestner, R. Ryan, R.M.|title=A Meta-Analytic Review of Experiments Examining the Effects of Extrinsic Rewards on Intrinsic Motivation|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1999|volume=125|pages=627–668|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.6.627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-determination theory is a broad theory of motivation in work organizations that maintains the predictions of cognitive evaluation theory but also recognizes the limitations of the theory, such as organizational conditions under which predictions do not apply or are less relevant in real-world settings, which cognitive evaluation theory fails to recognize. The theory differentiates between various types of motivational states, distinguishes the organizational conditions where extrinsic rewards are more effective than intrinsic rewards, examines individual differences in orientation toward intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation and discusses managerial behavior that can enhance intrinsic motivation. Findings from the Deci et al. (1989) study have supported self-determination theory as an approach to work motivation by showing how managers can impact the work attitudes of their employees. The study reported that managerial autonomy support which included provision of options, giving relevant information in a non-autonomous way, acknowledging subordinates' perspectives and cultivating self-initiation resulted in employees having more positive work-related attitudes such as higher level of job satisfaction and increased level of trust in corporate management.&lt;ref name="Gagne 2005 331–362"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gagne|first=M.|author2=Deci E.L.|title=Self-Determination Theory and Work Motivation|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|year=2005|volume=26|pages=331–362|doi=10.1002/job.322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Overjustification Effect Rewards and Motivation.jpg|thumb|upright|Directional effects of rewards on motivation, depending on type of task, type of reward, and contingency of reward.]] The overjustification effect is controversial because it challenges previous findings in psychology on the general effectiveness of [[reinforcement]] on increasing behavior, and also the widespread practice of using incentives in the classroom. These findings fail to account for situations whereby the nature of activities differ, such as in cases where the initial level of intrinsic interest in the activity is very low, introducing extrinsic contingencies may be essential for producing involvement.&lt;ref name="Lepper 1973 129–137"/&gt; These conclusions were challenged in a separate meta-analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Judy|author2=W. David Pierce|title=Reinforcement, reward, and intrinsic motivation: A meta-analysis|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=Fall 1994|volume=64|issue=3|pages=363–423|doi=10.3102/00346543064003363}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found that [[tangible]] rewards offered for outperforming others and for performing uninteresting tasks (in which intrinsic motivation is low) lead to increased intrinsic motivation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cameron |first=J. |year=2001 |title=Negative effects of reward on intrinsic motivation- A limited phenomenon: Comment on Deci, Koestner, and Ryan |journal=Review of Educational Research |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=29–42 |doi=10.3102/00346543071001029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that the detrimental effects of rewards on motivation only occur in a specific, restricted set of conditions that could be easily avoided.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Eisenberger|first = Robert|author2 = Cameron|title = Detrimental effects of reward: Reality or myth?|journal = American Psychologist|date = November 1996|volume = 51|issue = 11|pages = 1153–1166|doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.51.11.1153|first2 = Judy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of analyses included both high-interest and low-interest tasks, whereas the original meta-analyses conducted by Deci and colleagues (1999) restricted analyses to tasks in which participants initially had high interest. In fact, a 2001 [[meta-analysis]] showed that rewards can increase intrinsic motivation for tasks that initially hold little intrinsic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Judy|author2=Katherine M. Banko |author3=W. David Pierce |title=Pervasive negative effects of rewards on intrinsic motivation: The myth continues|journal=The Behavior Analyst|date=Spring 2001|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–44|url=http://www.behavior.org/resources/331.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2012|pmc=2731358|pmid=22478353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, according to Eisenberger and Cameron, claimed negative effects of extrinsic rewards on task interest derived from the Deci study (1971) do not take into consideration that conditions manufactured in laboratory settings that produce these effects are not true reflections of situations in the real world. For example, in the Deci study the incentive was provided for one session and was then arbitrarily withdrawn in the next and such incentive plans do not exist in the real world. Also, the reduced intrinsic interest seen in subjects may be explained by a negative reaction when the reward was withheld.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Eisenberger and his colleges also claimed that the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the dependent measure is highly questionable in the Deci study. Laboratory results that used the amount of free time spend on the task as the dependent measure are shown to be far weaker than when self reports are used for these measures. The Deci study gives far less weight to self reports, however self-reports about subjects' level of internal motivation seem to be a more direct measure of the psychological state of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberger|first=R|author2=Pierce, W.D. Cameron, J.|title=Effects of Reward on Intrinsic Motivation- Negative, Neutral and Positive: Comment on Deci, Koestner, and Ryan|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1999|volume=125|pages=677–691|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.6.677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable research has also shown that rewards tend to enhance feelings of competence and autonomy and high standards, pressure and competitiveness are able to increase these effects. For example, employees view earning [[incentives]] as enjoyable rather than a dreaded tool of management control. These findings are in contrast with the psychological mechanism for effects that Deci and his colleges had claimed in the past. Also in the past 30 years, notable academic reviews of rewards have confirmed that monetary incentives have shown to significantly increase performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerhart|first=B.|author2=Rynes, S.L. Fulmer, I.S.|title=Pay and Performance: Individuals, Groups, and Executives|journal=The Academy of Management Annals|year=2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=207–271|doi=10.1080/19416520903047269}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, some activities require a significant level of mastery or engagement before its attractiveness becomes apparent to an individual, in such cases external incentives may be useful to build individuals up to that level. [[Token economy]] programs represent one example in which there is evidence showing that such programs have successfully implemented extrinsic rewards to increase interest in certain broad classes of activities.&lt;ref name="Lepper 1973 129–137"/&gt;

There are also differences in effect among the different age groups. According to Deci et al. (1999), the negative effects extrinsic contingencies have on intrinsic motivation seem to be more severe for children than college students. One possible explanation is that college students have greater cognitive capacity, enabling them to better separate informational and controlling aspects of rewards. Hence they are able to interpret rewards as indicators of effective performance rather than controlling their behavior, which causes them to operate with performance-goal orientations. It is therefore speculated that such differences are far greater between children and employed workers.&lt;ref name="Deci 1999 627–668"/&gt;

A rebuttal defended the original findings, concluding that this analysis by Cameron (2001) was flawed and that Cameron's inclusion of boring tasks in analyzing potential overjustification effects made little theoretical or practical sense. This rebuttal argued that cognitive evaluation theory is the most consistent structure for explaining the effects of rewards on intrinsic motivation, pointing to several other papers that have supported the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deci |first=E. |last2=Koestner |first2=R. |last3=Ryan |first3=R. |year=2001 |title=The pervasive negative effects of rewards on intrinsic motivation: Response to Cameron (2001) |journal=Review of Educational Research |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=43–51 |doi=10.3102/00346543071001043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Education===
Findings from the Lepper et al.'s (1973) study suggest that presenting these extrinsic rewards poses central problems in the schooling system in that it fails to preserve the intrinsic interest in learning and exploration that a child may seem to possess during his initial phase in school. This also has severe ramifications on the education system, as it seems to almost undermine children's spontaneous interest in the process of learning itself, instead their motivation is driven by these extrinsic rewards. Research in this area suggests that parents and educators should rely on intrinsic motivation and preserve feelings of autonomy and competence as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deci |first=E. L. |year=1995 |title=Why we do what we do: The dynamics of personal autonomy |location=New York |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |isbn=0-399-14047-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the task is unattractive and intrinsic motivation is insufficient (e.g., household chores), then extrinsic rewards are useful to provide incentives for behavior.

School programs that provide money or prizes for reading books have been criticized for their potential to reduce intrinsic motivation by overjustification. However, a study of the [[Pizza Hut]] program, [[Book It!]], found that participation in the program neither increased nor decreased reading motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flora |first=S. R. |last2=Flora |first2=D. B. |year=1999 |title=Effects of extrinsic reinforcement for reading during childhood on reported reading habits of college students |journal=Psychological Record |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=3–14 |doi= |url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1446&amp;context=tpr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although motivating students to read by rewarding them may undermine their interest in reading, it may also encourage the reading skills necessary for developing an interest in reading.

===Workplace===
Cognitive evaluation theory further predicts the different types of rewards that will exert different effects. According to the theory, task non-contingent rewards like benefits that are based on things other than performance, such as employment that do not consist any information regarding autonomy and competence, will have no effect on intrinsic motivation. Task contingent rewards on the other hand like [[salary]] which are awarded for performing or completing a task, will be experienced as controlling and hence will have a negative effect on intrinsic motivation. The study conducted by Deckop and Cirka (2000) reported that introducing merit pay programs in a [[non-profit organization]] led to decreased feelings of autonomy and intrinsic motivation, indicating that rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation in work settings.&lt;ref name="Gagne 2005 331–362"/&gt;

Performance contingent rewards like monetary incentives that are given for good performance or meeting a certain standard will be experienced as highly controlling hence decreasing intrinsic motivation. The Shirom, Westman, and Melamed (1999) study found that [[pay for performance (human resources)|pay-for-performance]] plans resulted in lower well being in [[blue-collar workers]], and this was especially evident for those who felt that their jobs were monotonous.&lt;ref name="Gagne 2005 331–362"/&gt; However, in certain cases where the reward also conveys information about competence that will in turn reduce the negative effect.&lt;ref name="Deci 1999 627–668"/&gt;

===Gamification===
The term [[gamification]] refers to the application of game design elements to non-game contexts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deterding|first=Sebastian|author2=Kenton O'Hara |author3=Miguel Sicart |author4=Dan Dixon |author5=Lennart Nacke |title=Gamification: Using game design elements in non-gaming contexts|journal=CHI|year=2011|url=http://gamification-research.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/01-Deterding-Sicart-Nacke-OHara-Dixon.pdf|doi=10.1145/1979742.1979575|}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to drive participation, often with the goal of encouraging greater engagement with the non-game context by providing symbolic rewards such as points, badges, or [[virtual economy|virtual currency]]. However, a number of academics and other critics have expressed concern that these rewards may backfire via the overjustification effect. Drawing directly on self-determination theory, these critics of gamification express concerns that gamified contexts such as [[foursquare]] might provide expected rewards for activities that do not adequately meet self-determination theory's three innate needs for intrinsic motivation—relatedness, autonomy, and competence—and therefore reduce intrinsic interest in those activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Groh|first=Fabian|title=Gamification: State of the art definition and utilization|journal=Proceedings of the 4th Seminar on Research Trends in Media Informatics|date=February 14, 2012|url=http://hubscher.org/roland/courses/hf765/readings/Groh_2012.pdf|pp=39–46|DOI=10.18725/OPARU-1773|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616221900/http://hubscher.org/roland/courses/hf765/readings/Groh_2012.pdf|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowdsourcing===
Websites that rely on [[user-generated content]] sometimes offer monetary rewards for contributions, but these may cause the contributors to succumb to the overjustification effect and stop contributing.&lt;ref name="wisdump"&gt;wisdump:{{cite web |url=http://www.wisdump.com/web/the-overjustification-effect-and-user-generated-content/|title=The Overjustification Effect and User Generated Content|accessdate=Mar 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] allows the creator of a task to offer a monetary reward, but a survey of 431 Mechanical Turk participants showed that they are driven more by intrinsic motivations than a desire for the usually meager monetary compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Nicolas|last2=Schulze|first2=Thimo|last3=Veit|first3=Daniel|title=More than fun and money: Worker Motivation in Crowdsourcing – A Study on Mechanical Turk|journal=Proceedings of the Seventeenth Americas Conference on Information Systems, Detroit, Michigan|date=August 4, 2011|url=http://schader.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/files/publikationen/Kaufmann_Schulze_Veit_2011_-_More_than_fun_and_money_Worker_motivation_in_Crowdsourcing_-_A_Study_on_Mechanical_Turk_AMCIS_2011.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227173340/http://schader.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/files/publikationen/Kaufmann_Schulze_Veit_2011_-_More_than_fun_and_money_Worker_motivation_in_Crowdsourcing_-_A_Study_on_Mechanical_Turk_AMCIS_2011.pdf|archivedate=February 27, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overjustification effect was also considered in a study on how to maximize contributions when [[crowdsourcing]] creative endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Akar|first = Oguz Ali|last2 = van den Ende|first2 = Jan|title = Motivation, Reward Size and Contribution in Idea Crowdsourcing|journal = Dime-Druid Academy Winter Conference 2011|date = January 20, 2011|url = http://www.mendeley.com/research/motivation-reward-size-contribution-idea-crowdsourcing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volunteering===
Empirical evidence shows that expected financial rewards "crowd out" intrinsic motivation, while the size of the monetary reward simultaneously provides extrinsic motivation. If the size of the monetary reward is not large enough to compensate for the loss of intrinsic motivation, overall engagement can decline. A survey data-set revealed that small financial payments reduced [[Volunteering|volunteer]] hours among Swiss citizens, and that the median financial reward provided to these volunteers caused them to work less than volunteers who were not given any payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frey|first=Bruno S.|author2=Lorenz Goette|title=Does pay motivate volunteers?|journal=Zurich, Switzerland: Institute for Empirical Research in Economics Working Paper Series|year=1999|url=http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:25512/eth-25512-01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
The overjustification effect has also been linked to professional sports. The performance of numerous athletes has diminished following the signing of a lucrative, multimillion-dollar contract. Some notable professional athletes whose performances have diminished following a large contract include Alex Rodriguez (MLB), Albert Pujols (MLB), Wayne Rooney (Premier League) and Albert Haynesworth (NFL).

Since the beginning of the 21st century, several [[phylogenetic]] studies were conducted to aid clarifying the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic status]] of lion samples kept in museums and collected in the wild. Scientists analysed between 32 and 480 lion samples from up to 22 countries.

*[[Northern lion|''P. l. leo'']] in the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern]] and eastern regions of the species' historical and contemporary distribution
*''P. l. melanochaita'' in Southern and East African range countries.
The two groups were in contact in [[Ethiopia]]. A [[phylogeographic]] analysis of 194 lion [[DNA sequencing|sequence]]s from 22 countries indicated that East African and Southern African lions form a [[clade]] that diverged about 186,000–128,000 years ago from the clade formed by lions in North, West and Central Africa. In nine of 19 lion samples from Ethiopia, [[haplotype]]s of the Central African lion group were found, indicating that the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]] was not a complete barrier to gene flow; southeastern Ethiopia is considered a [[genetic admixture]] zone between Central and East African lions.&lt;ref name=Bertola_al2016/&gt;
 
Since 2005, several [[Phylogeography|phylogeographic]] studies were conducted to aid clarifying the taxonomic status of lion samples kept in museums and collected in the wild. Results of a [[DNA analysis]] using 26 lion samples from Southern and East Africa indicate that genetic variation between them is low and that two major [[clade]]s exist: one in southwestern Africa and one in the region from Uganda and Kenya to [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. Five lion samples from Kenya's [[Tsavo East National Park]] showed identical [[haplotype]]s as three lion samples from the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal region]] in South Africa.&lt;ref name=Dubach2005&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Dubach, J. |author2=Patterson, B.

A [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] and [[DNA]] analysis was conducted using samples from 15 captive lions in the [[Addis Ababa Zoo]] and from six wild lion populations.

=== Manes ===
In the 19th and 20th centuries, lion type specimen were described on the basis of mane size and colour.  Mane colour varies between tawny, isabelline and light reddish yellow.&lt;ref name="Guggisberg1963"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guggisberg, C. A. W. |title=Simba: The Life of the Lion |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4eTaAAAAMAAJ |year=1963 |publisher=Chilton Books |location=Philadelphia, PA |page= |asin=B000OKBJQ0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Cape lion type specimen had a black mane extending beyond the shoulders and under the belly.&lt;ref name=Smith1842/&gt; Yet, black-maned lions also occur in the [[Kalahari]] and eastern [[Okavango Delta]] alongside those with a normal tawny colour.&lt;ref name=Smithers1971&gt;{{cite book |last=Smithers |first=R. H. N. |year=1971 |title=The Mammals of Botswana |publisher=University of Pretoria |location=Pretoria |chapter=Panthera leo |pages=116−119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two male lions observed in the border region between Kenya and Tanzania had moderate tufts of hair on the knee joint, and their manes appeared brushed backwards. They were less cobby with longer legs and less curved backs than lions from other African range countries.&lt;ref name=Neumann/&gt; Male lions from the Ethiopian Highlands had dark and heavy manes with black tips that extended over the whole throat and chest to the forelegs and behind the shoulders.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt; A few lions observed in the environs of Mount Kilimanjaro had tawny to sandy coloured manes as well.&lt;ref name="Lönnberg1914"/&gt;
Until the late 20th century, mane colour and size was thought to be a distinct subspecific characteristic.&lt;ref name=Hemmer1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mazak1975/&gt;

In 2002, research in [[Serengeti National Park]] revealed that mane darkens with age; its colour and size are influenced by environmental factors like temperature and climate, but also by individual [[testosterone]] production, sexual maturity and genetic precondition. Mane length apparently signals fighting success in male–male relationships.&lt;ref name="WestPacker2002"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=West |first=P. M. |author2=Packer, C. |date=2002 |title=Sexual Selection, Temperature, and the Lion's Mane |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=297 |issue=5585 |pages=1339–1943 |doi=10.1126/science.1073257 |pmid=12193785|bibcode=2002Sci...297.1339W}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mane development is related to age: older males have more extensive manes than younger ones; manes continue to grow up to the age of four to five years, long after lions have become [[Sexual maturity|sexually mature]]. Males living in the highlands above an altitude of {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}} develop heavier manes than lions in the more humid and warmer lowlands of eastern and northern Kenya. The latter have thinner manes, or are even completely maneless.&lt;ref name="Gnoskeetal2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gnoske T. P. |author2=Celesia, G. G. |author3=Kerbis, Peterhans J.

[[White lion]]s have occasionally been encountered in and around [[Kruger National Park]] and the adjacent [[Timbavati Private Game Reserve]] in South Africa. Their whitish fur is a rare [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]] caused by a double [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]] [[allele]]. It has normal pigmentation in eyes and skin. White individuals have been occasionally encountered only in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent [[Timbavati Private Game Reserve]] in eastern South Africa. They were removed from the wild in the 1970s, thus decreasing the white lion [[gene pool]].

Results of a 10-year long survey on 50 [[Radio telemetry|radio-collared]] lions in the Kavango–Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area show that adult lions preferred grassland and [[shrubland]] habitat, but avoided woodlands and areas with high human density; by contrast, subadult [[biological dispersal|dispersing]] male lions avoided grasslands and shrublands, but moved in human-dominated areas to a larger extent.

=== Attacks on humans ===
* In the 19th century, north of [[Bechuanaland]], a lion non-fatally attacked [[David Livingstone]], who was defending a [[sheep]] in a [[village]].&lt;ref name="Jeal2013"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jeal |first=Tim |title=Livingstone: Revised and Expanded Edition |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2013 |isbn= |location= |pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two [[Tsavo Man-Eaters]] became known after an incident during the building of the [[Uganda Railway]] in the 1890s. Their [[skull]]s and [[skin]]s are part of the [[Zoology|zoological]] collection of the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]], the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref name="Kerbis2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kerbis Peterhans, J.

* The "Njombe lions" were a pride of lions in [[Njombe]], in what was then [[Tanganyika]], which for over three generations are thought to have preyed on 1,500 to 2,000 people.

* Towards the end of the same month, conservationist [[Kevin Richardson (zookeeper)|Kevin Richardson]] took three lions for a walk at Dinokeng Game Reserve, near [[Pretoria]] in South Africa. A lioness then pursued an impala for at least {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}}, before unexpectedly killing a 22-year-old woman near her car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Torchia, C. |title=Lion kills woman at refuge of South African ‘lion whisperer’ |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/lion-kills-woman-at-refuge-of-south-african-lion-whisperer/2018/02/28/f1630a0c-1c6b-11e8-98f5-ceecfa8741b6_story.html |date=2018 |access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Feingold, S. |title=Lion mauls woman to death at popular South African wildlife sanctuary |publisher=[[CNN]] |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/28/africa/woman-killed-lion-sanctuary-intl/index.html |date=2018 |access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2018, a "loud commotion" coming from lions was heard by an anti-poaching dog in Sibuya Game Reserve near [[Kenton-on-Sea]], South Africa.

== Threats ==
In Africa, lions are threatened by pre-emptive killing or in retaliation for preying on livestock. Prey base depletion, loss and conversion of habitat have led to a number of subpopulations becoming small and isolated. [[Trophy hunting]] has contributed to population declines in Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; Although lions and their prey are officially protected in Tsavo National Parks, they are regularly killed by local people, with over 100 known lion killings between 2001 and 2006.&lt;ref name="Frank_al2006"/&gt;
 
Between 2008 and 2013, bones and body parts from at least 2621 individual lions were exported from South Africa to [[Southeast Asia]], and another 3437 lion skeletons between 2014 and 2016. Lion bones are used to replace [[tiger]] bones in [[traditional Asian medicine]]s.&lt;ref name="Williams_al2017"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Williams, V. L. |author2=Loveridge, A.

In Zambia's [[Kafue National Park]], uncontrolled bushfires and hunting of lions and prey species makes it difficult for the lion population to recover. Cub mortality in particular is high.&lt;ref name="Midlane2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Midlane, N. |year=2013 |title=The conservation status and dynamics of a protected African lion ''Panthera leo'' population in Kafue National Park, Zambia |publisher=University of Cape Town |location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Conservation ==
African lions are included in [[CITES Appendix II]]. Today, lion populations are stable only in large protected area complexes.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; [[IUCN]] regional offices and many wildlife conservation organisations cooperated to develop a Lion Conservation Strategy for Eastern and Southern Africa in 2006. The strategy envisages to maintain sufficient habitat, ensure a sufficient wild prey base, make lion-human coexistence sustainable and reduce factors that lead to further fragmentation of populations.&lt;ref name=csg2006/&gt;
Local communities in several Southern African lion range countries generate significant income through [[wildlife tourism]], which is a strong incentive for their support of conservation measures.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;
 
=== In captivity ===
[[File:MP-panthera leo krugeri 5.jpg|thumb|Captive lion in [[Philadelphia Zoo]]]]
At the beginning of the 21st century, the [[Addis Ababa Zoo]] kept 16 adult lions. It is assumed that their ancestors, five males and two females, were caught in southwestern Ethiopia as part of a zoological collection for Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie I]].&lt;ref name=Brucheetal2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tefera |first=M. |title=Phenotypic and reproductive characteristics of lions (''Panthera leo'') at Addis Ababa Zoo |journal=Biodiversity &amp; Conservation |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=1629–1639 |year=2003 |doi=10.1023/A:1023641629538}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2006, eight captive lions were registered under the name ''P. l. massaicus'', and 23 as ''P. l. nubicus'' from Tanzania by the [[International Species Information System]]. In addition, about 100 captive lions were registered in ISIS as ''P. l. krugeri'', which derived from lions captured in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Barnett2006"/&gt; Interest in the Cape lion had led to attempts to conserve possible descendants in [[Tygerberg Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Associated Press]] Archive |title=South Africa: Lion Cubs Thought to Be Cape Lions |url=http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/SOUTH-AFRICA-LION-CUBS-THOUGHT-TO-BE-CAPE-LIONS/6f868f73b9fd62e43f31a152f6d011cc |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2011Capelion"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=The [[BBC News]] |title='Extinct' lions (Cape lion) surface in Siberia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1007452.stm |date=2000 |access-date=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35281">{{Other uses|Pattern recognition (disambiguation)}}

In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], '''pattern recognition''' describes a [[cognitive]] process that matches information from a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] with information [[Recall (memory)|retrieved]] from [[memory]].&lt;ref name=Eysenck&gt;Eysenck, Michael W.; Keane, Mark T. (2003). Cognitive Psychology: A Student's Handbook (4th ed.). Hove; Philadelphia; New York: Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|9780863775512}}. OCLC 894210185. Retrieved 27 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pattern recognition occurs when information from the environment is received and entered into [[short-term memory]], causing automatic activation of a specific content of [[long-term memory]]. An early example of this is learning the alphabet in order. When a carer repeats ‘A, B, C’ multiple times to a child, utilizing the pattern recognition, the child says ‘C’ after he/she hears ‘A, B’ in order. Recognizing patterns allow us to predict and expect what is coming. The process of pattern recognition involves matching the information received with the information already stored in the brain. Making the connection between memories and information perceived is a step of pattern recognition called identification. Pattern recognition requires repetition of experience. [[Semantic memory]], which is used implicitly and subconsciously is the main type of memory involved with recognition.&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;Snyder, B. (2000). Music and memory: An introduction. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pattern recognition is not only crucial to humans, but to other animals as well. Even koalas, who possess less-developed thinking abilities, use pattern recognition to find and consume eucalyptus leaves. The human brain has developed more, but holds similarities to the brains of birds and lower mammals. The development of [[neural networks]] in the outer layer of the brain in humans has allowed for better processing of visual and auditory patterns. Spatial positioning in the environment, remembering findings, and detecting hazards and resources to increase chances of survival are examples of the application of pattern recognition for humans and animals.&lt;ref name=mattson&gt;Mattson, M. P. (2014). Superior pattern processing is the essence of the evolved human brain. Frontiers in neuroscience, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six main theories of pattern recognition: template matching, [[prototype-matching]], feature analysis, [[recognition-by-components theory]], bottom-up and top-down processing, and [[Fourier analysis]]. The application of these theories in everyday life is not mutually exclusive. Pattern recognition allows us to read words, understand [[language]], recognize friends, and even appreciate [[music]]. Each of the theories applies to various activities and domains where pattern recognition is observed. Facial, music and language recognition, and seriation are a few of such domains. Facial recognition and seriation occur through encoding visual patterns, while music and language recognition use the encoding of auditory patterns.

==Theories==

===Template matching===
Template matching theory describes the most basic approach to human pattern recognition. It is a theory that assumes every perceived object is stored as a "template" into long-term memory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Shugen, W. (2002). Framework of pattern recognition model based on the cognitive psychology. Geo-spatial Information Science, 5(2), 74-78. https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02833890&lt;/ref&gt; Incoming information is compared to these templates to find an exact match.&lt;ref&gt;H. Gregg. (2013, May 1). Perception and perceptual illusions. Psychology Today. Retrieved from https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/theory-knowledge/201305/perception-and-perceptual-illusions&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, all sensory input is compared to multiple representations of an object to form one single conceptual understanding. The theory defines perception as a fundamentally recognition-based process. It assumes that everything we see, we understand only through past exposure, which then informs our future perception of the external world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Top-down and bottom-up theories of perception. (2009, June 27). Retrieved from http://cognitivepsychology.wikidot.com/cognition:topdown&lt;/ref&gt; For example, A, '''A''', and ''A'' are all recognized as the letter A, but not B. This viewpoint is limited, however, in explaining how new experiences can be understood without being compared to an internal memory template.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Y. Pi, W. Liao, M. Liu, &amp; J. Lu. (2008). Theory of cognitive pattern recognition. INTECH. Retrieved from http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/5795.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prototype matching===
Unlike the exact, one-to-one, template matching theory, prototype matching instead compares incoming sensory input to one average prototype.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This theory proposes that exposure to a series of related stimuli leads to the creation of a "typical" prototype based on their shared features.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It reduces the number of stored templates by standardizing them into a single representation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The prototype supports perceptual flexibility, because unlike in template matching, it allows for variability in the recognition of novel stimuli.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For instance, if a child had never seen a lawn chair before, they would still be able to recognize it as a chair because of their understanding of its essential characteristics as having four legs and a seat. This idea, however, limits the conceptualization of objects that cannot necessarily be "averaged" into one, like types of canines, for instance. Even though dogs, wolves, and foxes are all typically furry, four-legged, moderately sized animals with ears and a tail, they are not all the same, and thus cannot be strictly perceived with respect to the prototype matching theory.

===Feature analysis===
Multiple theories try to explain how humans are able to recognize patterns in their environment. Feature detection theory proposes that the nervous system sorts and filters incoming stimuli to allow the human (or animal) to make sense of the information. In the organism, this system is made up of [[Feature detection (nervous system)|feature detectors]], which are individual neurons, or groups of neurons, that encode specific perceptual features. The theory proposes an increasing complexity in the relationship between detectors and the perceptual feature. The most basic feature detectors respond to simple properties of the stimuli. Further along the perceptual pathway, higher organized feature detectors are able to respond to more complex and specific stimuli properties. When features repeat or occur in a meaningful sequence, we are able to identify these patterns because of our feature detection system.

=== Multiple discrimination scaling ===
{{unclear|section|reason=it is unclear what is meant by the distance of 50%|date=August 2018}}
Template and feature analysis approaches to recognition of objects (and situations) have been merged / reconciled / overtaken by multiple discrimination theory. This states that the amounts in a test stimulus of each salient feature of a template are recognized in any perceptual judgment as being at a distance in the universal unit of 50% discrimination (the objective performance 'JND'{{clarification needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Torgerson, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;) from the amount of that feature in the template.&lt;ref&gt;Booth &amp; Freeman, 1993, Acta Psychologica&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition by components theory===
[[File:Breakdown of objects into Geons.png|thumb|Image showing the breakdown of common geometric shapes (geons)]]
Similar to feature detection theory, [[Recognition-by-components theory|recognition by components]] (RBC) focuses on the bottom-up features of the stimuli being processed. First proposed by Irving Biederman (1987), this theory states that humans recognize objects by breaking them down into their basic 3D geometric shapes called geons (i.e. cylinders, cubes, cones, etc.). An example is how we break down a common item like a coffee cup: we recognize the hollow cylinder that holds the liquid and a curved handle off the side that allows us to hold it. Even though not every coffee cup is exactly the same, these basic components helps us to recognize the consistency across examples (or pattern). RBC suggests that are fewer than 36 unique geons that when combined can form a virtually unlimited number of objects. To parse and dissect an object, RBC proposes we attend to two specific features: edges and concavities. Edges enable the observer to maintain a consistent representation of the object regardless of the viewing angle and lighting conditions. Concavities are where two edges meet and enable the observer to perceive where one geon ends and another begins. 

The RBC principles of visual object recognition can be applied to auditory language recognition as well. In place of geons, language researchers propose that spoken language can be broken down into basic components called [[phoneme]]s. For example, there are 44 phonemes in the [[English language]].

===Top-down and bottom-up processing===
====Top-down processing====
Top-down processing refers to the use of background information in pattern recognition.&lt;ref name=simplepsyc &gt;McLeod, S. (2008) Visual Perception Theory. Simply Psychology. Retrieved from https://www.simplypsychology.org/perception-theories.html&lt;/ref&gt; It always begins with a person’s previous knowledge, and makes predictions due to this already acquired knowledge.&lt;ref name=PSU &gt;Wede, J. (2014, April 28). Bottom-up and Top-down Processing: A Collaborative Duality. Retrieved from: http://sites.psu.edu/psych256sp14/2014/04/28/bottom-up-and-top-down-processing-a-collaborative-duality/&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Richard Gregory estimated that about 90% of the information is lost between the time it takes to go from the eye to the brain, which is why the brain must guess what the person sees based on past experiences. In other words, we construct our perception of reality, and these perceptions are hypotheses or propositions based on past experiences and stored information. The formation of incorrect propositions will lead to errors of perception such as visual illusions.&lt;ref name="simplepsyc" /&gt; Given a paragraph written with difficult handwriting, it is easier to understand what the writer wants to convey if one reads the whole paragraph rather than reading the words in separate terms. The brain may be able to perceive and understand the gist of the paragraph due to the context supplied by the surrounding words.&lt;ref name= Sincero2013&gt;Sincero, S. M. (2013) Top-Down VS Bottom-Up Processing. Retrieved Oct 20, 2017 from Explorable.com: https://explorable.com/top-down-vs-bottom-up-processing&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bottom-up processing====
Bottom-up processing is also known as data-driven processing, because it originates with the stimulation of the sensory receptors.&lt;ref name="PSU"/&gt; Psychologist James Gibson opposed the top-down model and argued that perception is direct, and not subject to hypothesis testing as Gregory proposed. He stated that sensation is perception and there is no need for extra interpretation, as there is enough information in our environment to make sense of the world in a direct way. His theory is sometimes known as the "ecological theory" because of the claim that perception can be explained solely in terms of the environment. An example of bottom up-processing involves presenting a flower at the center of a person's field. The sight of the flower and all the information about the stimulus are carried from the retina to the visual cortex in the brain. The signal travels in one direction.&lt;ref name="Sincero2013"/&gt;

==Seriation==
[[File:Seriation task w shapes.jpg|thumb|A simple seriation task involving arranging shapes by size]]
In psychologist [[Jean Piaget]]'s theory of [[cognitive development]], the third stage is called the Concrete Operational State. It is during this stage that the abstract principle of thinking called "seriation" is naturally developed in a child.&lt;ref name=Kidd&gt;Kidd, J. K., Curby, T. W., Boyer, C., Gadzichowski, K., Gallington, D. A., Machado, J. A., &amp; Pasnak, R. (2012). Benefits of an intervention focused on oddity and seriation. Early Education and Development, 23(6), 900-918 https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10409289.2011.621877
&lt;/ref&gt; Seriation is the ability to arrange items in a logical order along a quantitative dimension such as length, weight, age, etc.&lt;ref name=Berk2013&gt;Berk, L. E. (2013). Development through the lifespan (6th ed.). Pearson. {{ISBN|9780205957606}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a general cognitive skill which is not fully mastered until after the nursery years .&lt;ref name=Curtis2002&gt;Curtis, A. (2002). Curriculum for the pre-school child. Routledge. {{ISBN|9781134770458}}&lt;/ref&gt; To seriate means to understand that objects can be ordered along a dimension,&lt;ref name= "Kidd"/&gt; and to effectively do so, the child needs to be able to answer the question "What comes next?"&lt;ref name= "Curtis2002"/&gt; Seriation skills also help to develop problem-solving skills, which are useful in recognizing and completing patterning tasks.

===Piaget's work on seriation===
Piaget studied the development of seriation along with Szeminska in an experiment where they used rods of varying lengths to test the skill of children's skills.&lt;ref name=Inhelder1964 &gt;Inhelder, B., &amp; Piaget, J. (1964). Early growth of logic in the child; classification and seriation, aby Bärbel Inhelder and Jean Piaget. New York: Routledge and Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; They found that there were three distinct stages of development of the skill. In the first stage, children around the age of 4 could not arrange the first ten rods in order. They could make smaller groups of 2-4, but could not put all the elements together. In
the second stage where the children were 5–6 years of age, they could succeed in the seriation task with the first ten rods through the process of trial and error. They could insert the other set of rods into order through trial and error. In the third stage, the 7-8-year-old children could arrange all the rods in order without much trial and error. The children used the systematic method of first looking for the smallest rod first and the smallest among the rest.&lt;ref name="Inhelder1964" /&gt;

===Development of problem-solving skills===
To develop the skill of seriation, which then helps advance [[problem-solving]] skills, children should be provided with opportunities to arrange things in order using the appropriate language, such as "big" and "bigger" when working with size relationships. They should also be given the chance to arrange objects in order based on the texture, sound, flavor and color.&lt;ref name="Curtis2002" /&gt; Along with specific tasks of seriation, children should be given the chance to compare the different materials and toys they use during play. Through activities like these, the true understanding of characteristics of objects will develop. To aid them at a young age, the differences between the objects should be obvious.&lt;ref name="Curtis2002" /&gt; Lastly, a more complicated task of arranging two different sets of objects and seeing the relationship between the two different sets should also be provided. A common example of this is having children attempt to fit saucepan lids to saucepans of different sizes, or fitting together different sizes of nuts and bolts.&lt;ref name="Curtis2002" /&gt;

===Application of seriation in schools===
To help build up math skills in children, teachers and parents can help them learn seriation and patterning. Young children who understand seriation can put numbers in order from lowest to highest. Eventually, they will come to understand that 6 is higher than 5, and 20 is higher than 10.&lt;ref name= mathseriation&gt;Basic Math Skills in Child Care: Creating Patterns and Arranging Objects in Order. Retrieved from Extension Articles on 2017-10-20 http://articles.extension.org/pages/25597/basic-math-skills-in-child-care:-creating-patterns-and-arranging-objects-in-order&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, having children copy patterns or create patterns of their own, like ABAB patterns, is a great way to help them recognize order and prepare for later math skills, such as multiplication. Child care providers can begin exposing children to patterns at a very young age by having them make groups and count the total number of objects.&lt;ref name="mathseriation"/&gt;

==Facial pattern recognition==
Recognizing faces is one of the most common forms of pattern recognition. Humans are incredibly effective at remembering faces, but this ease and automaticity belies a very challenging problem.&lt;ref name=SciAmerican&gt;Sheikh, K. (2017) How We Save Face--Researchers Crack the Brain's Facial-Recognition Code. Scientific American. Retrieved from: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-we-save-face-researchers-crack-the-brains-facial-recognition-code/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt; All faces are physically similar. Faces have two eyes, one mouth, and one nose all in predictable locations, yet humans can recognize a face from several different angles and in various lighting conditions.&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt; 

Neuroscientists posit that recognizing faces takes place in three phases. The first phase starts with visually focusing on of the physical features. The facial recognition system then needs to reconstruct the identity of the person from previous experiences. This provides us with the signal that this might be a person we know. The final phase of recognition completes when the face elicits the name of the person.&lt;ref name= BrainBlogger&gt;Wlassoff, V. (2015). How the Brain Recognizes Faces. Brain Blogger. Retrieved from: http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/17/how-the-brain-recognizes-faces/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although humans are great at recognizing faces under normal viewing angles, upside-down faces are tremendously difficult to recognize. This demonstrates not only the challenges of facial recognition but also how humans have specialized procedures and capacities for recognizing faces under normal upright viewing conditions.&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt;

===Neural mechanisms===
[[File:Fusiform Face Area - animation1.gif|thumb|Brain animation highlighting the fusiform face area, thought to be where facial processing and recognition takes place]]
Scientists agree that there is a certain area in the brain specifically devoted to processing faces. This structure is called the [[fusiform gyrus]], and brain imaging studies have shown that it becomes highly active when a subject is viewing a face.&lt;ref name=SciMag&gt;Norton, E. (2012). Identifying the Brain's own Facial Recognition System. Science Magazine. Retrieved from: http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/10/identifying-brains-own-facial-recognition-system&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several case studies have reported that patients with lesions or tissue damage localized to this area have tremendous difficulty recognizing faces, even their own. Although most of this research is circumstantial, a study at Stanford University provided conclusive evidence for the fusiform gyrus' role in facial recognition. In a unique case study, researchers were able to send direct signals to a patient's fusiform gyrus. The patient reported that the faces of the doctors and nurses changed and morphed in front of him during this electrical stimulation. Researchers agree this demonstrates a convincing causal link between this neural structure and the human ability to recognize faces.&lt;ref name="SciMag" /&gt;

===Facial recognition development===
Although in adults, facial recognition is fast and automatic, children do not reach adult levels of performance (in laboratory tasks) until adolescence.&lt;ref name=Article&gt;McKone, E., et al. (2012). A critical review of the development of face recognition: Experience is less important than previously believed. Cognitive Neuropsychology. doi 10.1080/02643294.2012.660138&lt;/ref&gt; Two general theories have been put forth to explain how facial recognition normally develops. The first, general cognitive development theory, proposes that the perceptual ability to encode faces is fully developed early in childhood, and that the continued improvement of facial recognition into adulthood is attributed to other general factors. These general factors include improved attentional focus, deliberate task strategies, and metacognition. Research supports the argument that these other general factors improve dramatically into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Article" /&gt; Face-specific perceptual development theory argues that the improved facial recognition between children and adults is due to a precise development of facial perception. The cause for this continuing development is proposed to be an ongoing experience with faces.

===Developmental issues===
Several developmental issues manifest as a decreased capacity for facial recognition. Using what is known about the role of the fusiform gyrus, research has shown that impaired social development along the [[autism spectrum]] is accompanied by a behavioral marker where these individuals tend to look away from faces, and a neurological marker characterized by decreased neural activity in the [[fusiform gyrus]].  Similarly, those with developmental [[prosopagnosia]] (DP) struggle with facial recognition to the extent they are often unable to identify even their own faces. Many studies report that around 2% of the world’s population have developmental prosopagnosia, and that individuals with DP have a family history of the trait.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;Duchaine, B. (2015). Individual differences in face recognition ability: Impacts on law enforcement, criminal justice and national security. APA: Psychological Science Agenda. Retrieved from:
 http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2015/06/face-recognition.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with DP are behaviorally indistinguishable from those with physical damage or lesions on the fusiform gyrus, again implicating its importance to facial recognition. Despite those with DP or neurological damage, there remains a large variability in facial recognition ability in the total population.&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt; It is unknown what accounts for the differences in facial recognition ability, whether it is a biological or environmental disposition. Recent research analyzing identical and fraternal [[twins]] showed that facial recognition was significantly higher correlated in identical twins, suggesting a strong genetic component to individual differences in facial recognition ability.&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt;

==Language development==

===Pattern recognition in language acquisition===
Recent{{when|date=May 2018}} research reveals that infant [[language acquisition]] is linked to cognitive pattern recognition.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Language ability linked to pattern recognition. (2013, May 29). VOA. Retrieved October 25, 2017 from https://www.voanews.com/a/language-ability-linked-to-pattern-recognition/1670776.html&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike classical [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] theories of [[language development]],&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Kuhl, P. K. (2000). A new view of language acquisition. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 97(22), 11850–11857. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.97.22.11850&lt;/ref&gt; scientists now believe that language is a learned skill.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Studies at the Hebrew University and the University of Sydney both show a strong correlation between the ability to identify visual patterns and to learn a new language.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;University of Sydney. (2016, May 5). Pattern learning key to children's language development. ScienceDaily. Retrieved October 25, 2017 from http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160505222938.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Children with high shape recognition showed better grammar knowledge, even when controlling for the effects of [[intelligence]] and [[memory]] capacity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This is supported by the theory that language learning is based on [[Statistical learning in language acquisition|statistical learning]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the process by which infants perceive common combinations of sounds and words in language and use them to inform future speech production.

===Phonological development===
The first step in infant language acquisition is to decipher between the most basic sound units of their native language. This includes every consonant, every short and long vowel sound, and any additional letter combinations like "th" and "ph" in English. These units, called [[phonemes]], are detected through exposure and pattern recognition. Infants use their "innate [[Feature detection (nervous system)|feature detector]]" capabilities to distinguish between the sounds of words.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They split them into phonemes through a mechanism of [[categorical perception]]. Then they extract statistical information by recognizing which combinations of sounds are most likely to occur together,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; like "qu" or "h" plus a vowel. In this way, their ability to learn words is based directly on the accuracy of their earlier phonetic patterning.

===Grammar development===
The transition from phonemic differentiation into higher-order word production&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; is only the first step in the hierarchical acquisition of language. Pattern recognition is furthermore utilized in the detection of [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] cues, the stress and intonation patterns among words.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Then it is applied to sentence structure and the understanding of typical [[clause]] boundaries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  This entire process is reflected in reading as well. First, a child recognizes patterns of individual letters, then words, then groups of words together, then paragraphs, and finally entire chapters in books.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Basulto, D. (2013, July 24). Humans are the world’s best pattern-recognition machines, but for how long? Retrieved October 25, 2017 from http://bigthink.com/endless-innovation/humans-are-the-worlds-best-pattern-recognition-machines-but-for-how-long&lt;/ref&gt; Learning to read and learning to speak a language are based on the "stepwise refinement of patterns"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; in perceptual pattern recognition.

==Music pattern recognition==
[[Music]] provides deep and emotional experiences for the listener.&lt;ref name=lehrer&gt;Lehrer, Jonah. “The Neuroscience Of Music.” Wired, Conde Nast, 3 June 2017, www.wired.com/2011/01/the-neuroscience-of-music/.&lt;/ref&gt; These experiences become contents in [[long-term memory]], and every time we hear the same tunes, those contents are activated. Recognizing the content by the pattern of the music affects our emotion. The mechanism that forms the pattern recognition of music and the experience has been studied by multiple researchers. The sensation felt when listening to our favorite music is evident by the dilation of the pupils, the increase in pulse and blood pressure, the streaming of blood to the leg muscles, and the activation of the [[cerebellum]], the brain region associated with physical movement.&lt;ref name="lehrer" /&gt; 
While retrieving the [[memory]] of a tune demonstrates general recognition of musical pattern, pattern recognition also occurs while listening to a tune for the first time. The recurring nature of the [[metre]] allows the listener to follow a tune, recognize the metre, expect its upcoming occurrence, and figure the [[rhythm]]. The excitement of following a familiar music pattern happens when the pattern breaks and becomes unpredictable. This following and breaking of a pattern creates a problem-solving opportunity for the mind that form the experience.&lt;ref name="lehrer" /&gt; Psychologist Daniel Levitin argues that the repetitions, melodic nature and organization of this music create meaning for the brain.&lt;ref name=levitin&gt;Levitin, D. J. (2006). This is your brain on music: The science of a human obsession. Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; The brain stores information in an arrangement of [[neuron]]s which retrieve the same information when activated by the environment. By constantly referencing information and additional stimulation from the environment, the brain constructs musical features into a perceptual whole.&lt;ref name="levitin" /&gt; 

The medial [[prefrontal cortex]] – one of the last areas affected by [[Alzheimer’s disease]] – is the region activated by music.

===Cognitive mechanisms===
To understand music pattern recognition, we need to understand the underlying cognitive systems that each handle a part of this process. Various activities are at work in this recognition of a piece of music and its patterns. Researchers have begun to unveil the reasons behind the stimulated reactions to music. Montreal-based researchers asked ten volunteers who got "chills" listening to music to listen to their favorite songs while their brain activity was being monitored.&lt;ref name="lehrer" /&gt; The results show the significant role of the [[nucleus accumbens]] (NAcc) region – involved with cognitive processes such as motivation, reward, addiction, etc. – creating the neural arrangements that make up the experience.&lt;ref name="lehrer" /&gt; A sense of reward prediction is created by anticipation before the climax of the tune, which comes to a sense of resolution when the climax is reached. The longer the listener is denied the expected pattern, the greater the emotional arousal when the pattern returns. Musicologist Leonard Meyer used fifty measures of [[Beethoven]]’s 5th movement of the String Quartet in C-sharp minor, Op. 131 to examine this notion.&lt;ref name="lehrer" /&gt; The stronger this experience is, the more vivid memory it will create and store. This strength affects the speed and accuracy of retrieval and recognition of the musical pattern. The brain not only recognizes specific tunes, it distinguishes standard acoustic features, speech and music. 

MIT researchers conducted a study to examine this notion.&lt;ref name=bushak&gt;Bushak, L. (2017). This Is Your Brain On Music: How Our Brains Process Melodies That Pull On Our Heartstrings. [online] Medical Daily. Available at: http://www.medicaldaily.com/your-brain-music-how-our-brains-process-melodies-pull-our-heartstrings-271007 [Accessed 26 Oct. 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed six neural clusters in the [[auditory cortex]] responding to the sounds. Four were triggered when hearing standard acoustic features, one specifically responded to speech, and the last exclusively responded to music. Researchers who studied the correlation between temporal evolution of timbral, tonal and rhythmic features of music, came to the conclusion that music engages the brain regions connected to motor actions, emotions and creativity. The research indicates that the whole brain "lights up" when listening to music.&lt;ref name=bergland&gt;Bergland, C. (2013, December 11). Why Do the Songs from Your Past Evoke Such Vivid Memories? Retrieved from https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201312/why-do-the-songs-your-past-evoke-such-vivid-memories&lt;/ref&gt; This amount of activity boosts memory preservation, hence pattern recognition. 

Recognizing patterns of music is different for a musician and a listener. Although a musician may play the same notes every time, the details of the frequency will always be different. The listener will recognize the musical pattern and their types despite the variations. These musical types are conceptual and learned, meaning they might vary culturally.&lt;ref name=agus&gt;Agus, T. R., Thorpe, S. J., &amp; Pressnitzer, D. (2010). Rapid formation of robust auditory memories: insights from noise. Neuron, 66(4), 610-618.&lt;/ref&gt; While listeners are involved with recognizing (implicit) musical material, musicians are involved with recalling them (explicit).&lt;ref name="snyder" /&gt; 

A UCLA study found that when watching or hearing music being played, neurons associated with the muscles needed for playing the instrument fire. [[Mirror neurons]] light up when musicians and non-musicians listen to a piece.&lt;ref name=byrne&gt;Byrne, D. (2012, October). How Do Our Brains Process Music? Retrieved from https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/how-do-our-brains-process-music-32150302/?no-ist=&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental issues===
Pattern recognition of music can build and strengthen other skills, such as musical synchrony and attentional performance and musical notation and brain engagement. Even a few years of musical training enhances memory and attention levels. Scientists at University of Newcastle conducted a study on patients with severe [[acquired brain injuries]] (ABIs) and healthy participants, using popular music to examine music-evoked [[autobiographical memories]] (MEAMs).&lt;ref name="bergland" /&gt; The participants were asked to record their familiarity with the songs, whether they liked them and what memories they evoked. The results showed that the ABI patients had the highest MEAMs, and all the participants had MEAMs of a person, people or life period that were generally positive.&lt;ref name="bergland" /&gt; The participants completed the task by utilizing pattern recognition skills. Memory evocation caused the songs to sound more familiar and well-liked. This research can be beneficial to rehabilitating patients of autobiographical amnesia who do not have fundamental deficiency in autobiographical recall memory and intact pitch perception.&lt;ref name="bergland" /&gt; 

In a study at University of California, Davis mapped the brain of participants while they listened to music.&lt;ref name=greensfelder&gt;Greensfelder, L. (2009, February). Study Finds Brain Hub that Links Music, Memory and Emotion. Retrieved from https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/study-finds-brain-hub-links-music-memory-and-emotion&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed links between brain regions to [[autobiographical memories]] and emotions activated by familiar music. This study can explain the strong response of patients with Alzheimer’s disease to music. This research can help such patients with pattern recognition-enhancing tasks.

==False pattern recognition==
{{Main|Apophenia}}
[[File:SharkOrSubmarine4024617900.jpg|thumb|[[Whale]], [[submarine]] or [[sheep]]?]]
The human tendency to see patterns that do not actually exist is called [[apophenia]]. Examples include the Man in the Moon, faces or figures in shadows, in clouds, and in patterns with no deliberate design, such as the swirls on a baked confection, and the perception of causal [[synchronicity|relationships between events]] which are, in fact, unrelated.  Apophenia figures prominently in [[conspiracy theories]], [[gambling]], misinterpretation of [[statistics]] and [[scientific]] data, and some kinds of [[religion|religious]] and [[paranormal]] experiences.  Misperception of patterns in random data is called [[pareidolia]].

'''Project Lyra''' is a feasibility study of a mission to the [[interstellar object]] [[ʻOumuamua]], initiated on the {{date|30 October 2017|in astronomy}} by the [[Initiative for Interstellar Studies]] (i4is).&lt;ref name=EA&gt;[https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/space-flight/how-we-could-explore-that-interstellar-asteroid IEEE Spectrum: How We Could Explore That Interstellar Asteroid by Evan Ackerman (29th Nov. 2017) ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SA-1&gt;Scientific American: "SpaceX’s Planned Giant Rocket Could Chase Down Interstellar Asteroid" (29th Nov. 2017) | https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/spacex-rsquo-s-planned-giant-rocket-could-chase-down-interstellar-asteroid/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UT-1&gt;Universe Today: "Project Lyra, A Mission to Chase Down That Interstellar Asteroid" | [https://www.universetoday.com/137960/project-lyra-mission-chase-interstellar-asteroid-1/ PROJECT LYRA, A MISSION TO CHASE DOWN THAT INTERSTELLAR ASTEROID] Matt Williams, 24 Nov, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ProjectLyra/&gt;

==Overview==
The suggested options for sending a spacecraft to ʻOumuamua within a time-frame of 5 to 10 years are based on using first a Jupiter [[Planetary flyby |flyby]] followed by a close solar [[Planetary flyby |flyby]] at 3 solar radii in order to take advantage of the [[Oberth effect]] or more advanced options such as a [[solar sails|solar sail]] and a [[Laser propulsion |laser sail]].&lt;ref name="Hein2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|W9Pr8mQoiRM|Oumuamua interstellar}} Xuất bản 26 thg 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detail==
The [[Initiative for Interstellar Studies]] (i4is) launched Project Lyra to assess the feasibility of a mission to ʻOumuamua.&lt;ref name=ProjectLyra&gt;{{cite web |title=Project Lyra – A Mission to ʻOumuamua |url=https://i4is.org/what-we-do/technical/project-lyra/ |website=I4IS |publisher=Initiative for Interstellar Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several options for sending a spacecraft to ʻOumuamua within a time-frame of 5 to 10 years were suggested.

[[Image:Disk to Sphere using Quotient Space.gif|thumb|Illustration of quotient space, [[N-sphere|{{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}]], obtained by ''gluing'' the boundary (in blue) of the [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] {{math|''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} together to a single point.]]
In [[topology]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''quotient space''' (also called an '''identification space''') is, intuitively speaking, the result of identifying or "gluing together" certain points of a given [[topological space]]. The points to be identified are specified by an [[equivalence relation]]. This is commonly done in order to construct new spaces from given ones. The '''quotient topology''' consists of all sets with an [[open set|open]] [[preimage]] under the [[canonical projection map]] that maps each element to its equivalence class.

== Definition ==
Let {{math|(''X'', ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be a [[topological space]], and let {{math|~}} be an [[equivalence relation]] on {{math|''X''}}. The '''quotient space''', {{math|1=''Y'' = ''X'' / ~}} is defined to be the set of [[equivalence class]]es of elements of {{math|''X''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;Y = \Big\{ [x] : x \in X \Big\} = \Big\{\{v \in X : v \sim x\} : x \in X\Big\},&lt;/math&gt;
equipped with the topology where the open sets are defined to be those sets of equivalence classes whose unions are open sets in ''X'':
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_Y = \Bigl\{ {\textstyle U \subseteq Y : \bigcup U = \bigl( \bigcup_{ [a] \in U} [a] \bigr) \in \tau_X }\Bigr\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, we can define them to be those sets with an open preimage under the surjective map {{math|''q'' : ''X'' → ''X'' / ~}}, which sends a point in {{math|''X''}} to the equivalence class containing it:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_Y=\left\{ U \subseteq Y : q^{-1}(U) \in \tau_X \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The quotient topology is the [[final topology]] on the quotient space with respect to the  map {{math|''q''}}.

== Quotient map ==
A map &lt;math&gt;f: X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a '''quotient map''' (sometimes called an '''identification map''') if it is [[surjective function|surjective]], and a subset ''U'' of ''Y'' is open if and only if &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is open. Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a quotient map if it is onto and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is equipped with the [[final topology]]  with respect to  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

Given an equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the canonical map &lt;math&gt;q: X \to X/{\sim}&lt;/math&gt; is a quotient map.

== Examples ==
*'''Gluing'''.  Topologists talk of gluing points together.  If ''X'' is a topological space and points &lt;math&gt;x,y \in X&lt;/math&gt; are to be "glued", then what is meant is that we are to consider the quotient space obtained from the equivalence relation {{nowrap|''a'' ~ ''b''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}} or {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''x'', ''b'' = ''y''}} (or {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''y'', ''b'' = ''x''}}).
*Consider the unit square {{nowrap|1=''I''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = [0,1] × [0,1]}} and the equivalence relation ~ generated by the requirement that all boundary points be equivalent, thus identifying all boundary points to a single equivalence class. Then ''I''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/~ is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[sphere|unit sphere]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
*'''[[Adjunction space]]'''. More generally, suppose ''X'' is a space and ''A'' is a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of ''X''. One can identify all points in ''A'' to a single equivalence class and leave points outside of ''A'' equivalent only to themselves. The resulting quotient space is denoted ''X''/''A''. The 2-sphere is then homeomorphic to the unit disc with its boundary identified to a single point: &lt;math&gt;D^{2}/\partial{D^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.
*Consider the set &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of all [[real number]]s with the ordinary topology, and write {{nowrap|1=''x'' ~ ''y''}} [[if and only if]] {{nowrap|''x'' − ''y''}} is an [[integer]]. Then the quotient space ''X''/~ is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[unit circle]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; via the homeomorphism which sends the equivalence class of ''x'' to exp(2π''ix'').
*A generalization of the previous example is the following: Suppose a [[topological group]] ''G'' [[group action|acts]] continuously on a space ''X''. One can form an equivalence relation on ''X'' by saying points are equivalent if and only if they lie in the same [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]]. The quotient space under this relation is called the '''orbit space''', denoted ''X''/''G''. In the previous example {{nowrap|1=''G'' = '''Z'''}} acts on '''R''' by translation. The orbit space '''R'''/'''Z''' is homeomorphic to ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

''Note'': The notation '''R'''/'''Z''' is somewhat ambiguous. If '''Z''' is understood to be a group acting on '''R''' via addition, then the [[Quotient group|quotient]] is the circle. However, if '''Z''' is thought of as a subspace of '''R''', then the quotient is a countably infinite [[bouquet of circles]] joined at a single point.

== Properties ==
Quotient maps {{nowrap|''q'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} are characterized among surjective maps by the following property: if ''Z'' is any topological space and {{nowrap|''f'' : ''Y'' → ''Z''}} is any function, then ''f'' is continuous if and only if {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''q''}} is continuous.

[[Image:QuotientSpace-01.svg|center|Characteristic property of the quotient topology]]

The quotient space ''X''/~ together with the quotient map {{nowrap|''q'' : ''X'' → ''X''/~}} is characterized by the following [[universal property]]: if {{nowrap|''g'' : ''X'' → ''Z''}} is a continuous map such that {{nowrap|''a'' ~ ''b''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''g''(''a'') = ''g''(''b'')}} for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X'', then there exists a unique continuous map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X''/~ → ''Z''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''f'' ∘ ''q''}}. We say that ''g'' ''descends to the quotient''.

The continuous maps defined on ''X''/~ are therefore precisely those maps which arise from continuous maps defined on ''X'' that respect the equivalence relation (in the sense that they send equivalent elements to the same image). This criterion is copiously used when studying quotient spaces.

Given a continuous surjection {{nowrap|''q'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} it is useful to have criteria by which one can determine if ''q'' is a quotient map. Two sufficient criteria are that ''q'' be [[open map|open]] or [[closed map|closed]]. Note that these conditions are only [[sufficient condition|sufficient]], not [[necessary condition|necessary]]. It is easy to construct examples of quotient maps that are neither open nor closed. For topological groups, the  quotient map is open.

== Compatibility with other topological notions ==
* [[Separation axioms|Separation]]
** In general, quotient spaces are ill-behaved with respect to separation axioms. The separation properties of ''X'' need not be inherited by ''X''/~, and ''X''/~ may have separation properties not shared by ''X''.
** ''X''/~ is a [[T1 space]] if and only if every equivalence class of ~ is closed in ''X''.
** If the quotient map is [[open map|open]], then ''X''/~ is a [[Hausdorff space]] if and only if ~ is a closed subset of the [[product space]] ''X''&amp;times;''X''.
* [[Connectedness]]
** If a space is connected or [[path connected]], then so are all its quotient spaces.
** A quotient space of a [[simply connected]] or [[contractible]] space need not share those properties.
* [[Compact space|Compactness]]
** If a space is compact, then so are all its quotient spaces.
** A quotient space of a [[locally compact]] space need not be locally compact.
* [[Dimension]]
** The [[topological dimension]] of a quotient space can be more (as well as less) than the dimension of the original space; [[space-filling curve]]s provide such examples.

This index captures theuman Development of the average person in society, which is less than when there is inequality in the distribution of health, education and income.]]

'''Social inequality''' occurs when resources in a given society are distributed unevenly, typically through [[Norm (social)|norms]] of allocation, that engender specific patterns along lines of socially defined categories of persons. It is the differentiation preference of access of social goods in the society brought about by power, religion, kinship, prestige, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and class. The social rights include labor market, the source of income, health care, and freedom of speech, education, political representation, and participation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=Robert H.|title=The Piketty phenomenon and the future of inequality|journal=Real World Economics Review|date=2014|issue=69–7|pages=2–17|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue69/Wade69.pdf|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social inequality linked to [[economic inequality]], usually described on the basis of the [[income inequality|unequal distribution of income]] or [[wealth]], is a frequently studied type of social inequality. Though the disciplines of [[economics]] and [[sociology]] generally use different theoretical approaches to examine and explain economic inequality, both fields are actively involved in [[researching]] this inequality. However, social and natural resources other than purely economic resources are also unevenly distributed in most societies and may contribute to [[social status]]. Norms of allocation can also affect the distribution of [[rights]] and [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileges]], [[Power (social and political)|social power]], access to [[public goods]] such as [[education]] or the [[judiciary|judicial system]], adequate [[Housing inequality|housing]], [[transportation]], [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and [[financial services]] such as [[banking]] and other social [[Good (economics)|good]]s and services.

Many societies worldwide claim to be [[Meritocracy|meritocracies]]—that is, that their societies exclusively distribute resources on the basis of merit. The term "meritocracy" was coined by [[Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington|Michael Young]] in his 1958 dystopian essay "[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]" to demonstrate the social dysfunctions that he anticipated arising in societies where the elites believe that they are successful entirely on the basis of merit, so the adoption of this term into English without negative connotations is ironic;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment|title=Down with meritocracy|last=Young|first=Michael|date=28 June 2001|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young was concerned that the [[Tripartite System]] of education being practiced in the United Kingdom at the time he wrote the essay considered merit to be "intelligence-plus-effort, its possessors ... identified at an early age and selected for appropriate intensive education" and that the "obsession with quantification, test-scoring, and qualifications" it supported would create an educated middle-class elite at the expense of the education of the working class, inevitably resulting in injustice and – eventually – revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todd|first=D.

Although merit matters to some degree in many societies, research shows that the distribution of resources in societies often follows hierarchical social categorizations of persons to a degree too significant to warrant calling these societies "meritocratic", since even exceptional intelligence, talent, or other forms of merit may not be compensatory for the social disadvantages people face. In many cases, social inequality is linked to [[#Racial and ethnic inequality|racial inequality]], [[ethnicity|ethnic inequality]], and [[gender inequality]], as well as other social statuses and these forms can be related to corruption.&lt;ref name="AP-20140127"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rugaber |first1=Christopher S. |last2=Boak |first2=Josh |title=Wealth gap: A guide to what it is, why it matters |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20140127/DABJ40P00.html |date=27 January 2014 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=27 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common metric for comparing social inequality in different nations is the [[Gini coefficient]], which measures the concentration of wealth and income in a nation from 0 (evenly distributed wealth and income) to 1 (one person has all wealth and income). Two nations may have identical Gini coefficients but dramatically different economic ([[Gross domestic product|output]]) and/or [[quality of life]], so the Gini coefficient must be contextualized for meaningful comparisons to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2010/chapters|title=Reports {{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|language=en|access-date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Social inequality is found in almost every society. Social inequality is shaped by a range of structural factors, such as geographical location or citizenship status, and are often underpinned by cultural discourses and identities defining, for example, whether the poor are 'deserving' or 'undeserving'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New Dimensions of Social Inequality|url = http://www.ceelbas.ac.uk/research/socialinequality|website = www.ceelbas.ac.uk|accessdate = 22 September 2015|last = Walker|publisher = |first = Dr. Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; In simple societies, those that have few social roles and statuses occupied by its members, social inequality may be very low. In [[tribal]] societies, for example, a tribal head or chieftain may hold some privileges, use some tools, or wear marks of office to which others do not have access, but the daily life of the chieftain is very much like the daily life of any other tribal member. [[Anthropologist]]s identify such highly egalitarian cultures as "[[kinship]]-oriented", which appear to value social harmony more than wealth or status. These cultures are contrasted with materially oriented cultures in which status and wealth are prized and competition and conflict are common. Kinship-oriented cultures may actively work to prevent [[Dominance hierarchy|social hierarchies]] from developing because they believe that could lead to conflict and instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gender and Rural Development | publisher=LIT Verlag Münster | author=Deji, Olanike F. | year=2011 | location=London | page=93 | isbn=978-3643901033}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's world, most of our population lives in more complex than simple societies. As [[social complexity]] increases, inequality tends to increase along with a widening gap between the poorest and the most wealthy members of society.&lt;ref name="AP-20140127"/&gt;

Social inequality can be classified into egalitarian societies, ranked society, and stratified society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic inequality in the United States|last=Osberg|first=L.|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egalitarian societies are those communities advocating for social equality through equal opportunities and rights hence no discrimination. People with special skills were not viewed as superior compared to the rest. The leaders do not have the power they only have influence. The norms and the beliefs the egalitarian society holds are for sharing equally and equal participation. Simply there are no classes. Ranked society mostly is agricultural communities who hierarchically grouped from the chief who is viewed to have a status in the society. In this society, people are clustered regarding status and prestige and not by access to power and resources. The chief is the most influential person followed by his family and relative, and those further related to him are less ranked. Stratified society is societies which horizontally ranked into the upper class, middle class, and lower class. The classification is regarding wealth, power, and prestige. The upper class are mostly the leaders and are the most influential in the society. It's possible for a person in the society to move from one stratum to the other. The social status is also hereditable from one generation to the next.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are five systems/types of social inequality which include wealth inequality, treatment and responsibility inequality, political inequality, life inequality, and membership inequality. Political inequality is the difference brought about by the ability to access federal resources which therefore have no civic equality. In treatment and responsibility difference some people are more benefited and can quickly receive more privileged than others. In working stations, some are given more responsibilities and hence better compensations and more benefits than the rest even when equally qualified. Membership inequality this is the number of members in a family, nation or of faith. Life inequality is brought about by the disparity of opportunities if presented they improves a person life quality. Finally, the income and wealth inequality is the disparity due to what an individual can earn on a daily basis contributing to their total revenue either monthly or yearly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The major examples of social inequality include income gap, gender inequality, health care, and social class. In health care, some individuals receive better and more professional care compared to others. They are also expected to pay more for these services. Social class differential comes evident during the public gathering where upper-class people given the best places to seat, the hospitality they receive and the first priorities they receive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Status in society is of two types which are [[Ascribed status|ascribed characteristics]] and [[achieved status|achieved characteristics]]. Ascribed characteristics are those present at birth or assigned by others and over which an individual has little or no control. Examples include sex, skin colour, eye shape, place of birth, sexuality, gender identity, parentage and social status of parents. Achieved characteristics are those which we earn or choose; examples include level of education, marital status, leadership status and other measures of [[Meritocracy|merit]]. In most societies, an individual's social status is a combination of ascribed and achieved factors. In some societies, however, only ascribed statuses are considered in determining one's social status and there exists little to no [[social mobility]] and, therefore, few paths to more social equality.&lt;ref name="Sernau13"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Inequality in a Global Age (4th edition)|publisher=Sage|year=2013|isbn=978-1452205403|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|author=Sernau, Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of social inequality is generally referred to as [[caste|caste inequality]].

One's social location in a society's overall structure of [[social stratification]] affects and is affected by almost every aspect of social life and one's [[life chances]].&lt;ref name="Neckerman"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Inequality: Causes and Consequences |author1=Neckerman, Kathryn M.  |author2=Florencia Torche  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Annual Review of Sociology | year=2007 | volume=33 | pages=335–357 | doi= 10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131755| jstor=29737766}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single best [[Dependent and independent variables|predictor]] of an individual's future social status is the social status into which they were born. Theoretical approaches to explaining social inequality concentrate on questions about how such [[social differentiation]]s arise, what types of resources are being allocated (for example, reserves versus resources),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullati|first=Stéphane|last2=Kliegel|first2=Matthias|last3=Widmer|first3=Eric|date=2018-07-30|title=Development of reserves over the life course and onset of vulnerability in later life|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=2|issue=8|pages=551–558|doi=10.1038/s41562-018-0395-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; what are the roles of human [[cooperation]] and [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] in allocating resources, and how do these differing types and forms of inequality affect the overall functioning of a society?

The variables considered most important in explaining inequality and the manner in which those variables combine to produce the inequities and their social consequences in a given society can change across time and place. In addition to interest in comparing and contrasting social inequality at local and national levels, in the wake of today's [[globalization|globalizing]] processes, the most interesting question becomes: what does inequality look like on a worldwide scale and what does such global inequality bode for the future? In effect, globalization reduces the distances of time and space, producing a global interaction of cultures and societies and social roles that can increase global inequities.&lt;ref name="Sernau13" /&gt;

==Inequality and ideology==
Philosophical questions about social [[ethics]] and the desirability or inevitability of inequality in human societies have given rise to a spate of [[ideologies]] to address such questions.&lt;ref name="George90"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ideology and Social Welfare (2nd edition) | publisher=Routledge |author1=George, Victor  |author2=Paul Wilding  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1990 | isbn=978-0415051019}}&lt;/ref&gt; We can broadly classify these ideologies on the basis of whether they justify or [[Legitimation|legitimize]] inequality, casting it as desirable or inevitable, or whether they cast equality as desirable and inequality as a feature of society to be reduced or eliminated. One end of this ideological [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]] can be called "[[Individualist]]", the other "[[Collectivism|Collectivist]]".&lt;ref name="George90" /&gt; In Western societies, there is a long history associated with the idea of individual ownership of [[private property|property]] and [[economic liberalism]], the ideological belief in organizing the economy on individualist lines such that the greatest possible number of economic decisions are made by individuals and not by collective institutions or organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Political Ideology Today | publisher=Manchester University Press | author=Adams, Ian | year=2001 | location=Manchester | isbn=978-0719060205}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laissez-faire]], [[free market]] ideologies—including [[classical liberalism]], [[neoliberalism]], and [[libertarianism]]—are formed around the idea that social inequality is a "natural" feature of societies, is therefore inevitable and, in some philosophies, even desirable. Inequality provides for differing goods and services to be offered on the open [[Market (economics)|market]], spurs ambition, and provides incentive for industriousness and [[innovation]]. At the other end of the continuum, collectivists place little to no trust in "free market" economic systems, noting widespread lack of access among specific groups or classes of individuals to the costs of entry to the market. Widespread inequalities often lead to [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] and dissatisfaction with the current social order. Such ideologies include [[Fabian society|Fabianism]] and [[socialism]]. Inequality, in these ideologies, must be reduced, eliminated, or kept under tight control through collective regulation.&lt;ref name="George90" /&gt; Furthermore, in some views inequality is natural but shouldn't affect certain [[fundamental human needs]], [[human rights]] and the initial chances given to individuals (e.g. by [[education]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kolnai|first1=Aurel|title=Privilege and Liberty and Other Essays in Political Philosophy|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739100776|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OcFDFLcXLdkC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is out of proportions due to various problematic systemic structures.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Though the above discussion is limited to specific Western ideologies, it should be noted that similar thinking can be found, historically, in differing societies throughout the world. While, in general, eastern societies tend toward collectivism, elements of individualism and free market organization can be found in certain regions and historical eras. Classic Chinese society in the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang dynasties]], for example, while highly organized into tight hierarchies of [[horizontal inequality]] with a distinct power elite also had many elements of free trade among its various regions and subcultures.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, Patricia Buckley Anne Walthall, James Palais. (2006). ''East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social mobility]] is the movement along social strata or hierarchies by individuals, [[ethnic group]], or nations. There is a change in literacy, [[income distribution]], education and health status. The movement can be vertical or horizontal. Vertical is the upward or downward movement along social strata which occurs due to change of jobs or marriage. Horizontal movement along levels that are equally ranked. Intra-generational mobility is a social status change in a generation (single lifetime). For example, a person moves from a junior staff in an organization to the [[senior management]]. The absolute management movement is where a person gains better social status than their parents, and this can be due to improved security, economic development, and better education system.  Relative mobility is where some individual are expected to have higher social ranks than their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climbing Mount Laurel: The struggle for affordable housing and social mobility in an American suburb|last=Massey, D.

Today, there is belief held by some that social inequality often creates political conflict and growing consensus that political structures determine the solution for such conflicts. Under this line of thinking, adequately designed social and political institutions are seen as ensuring the smooth functioning of [[Market (economics)|economic markets]] such that there is political stability, which improves the long-term outlook, enhances labour and capital productivity and so stimulates [[economic growth]]. With higher economic growth, net gains are positive across all levels and political reforms are easier to sustain. This may explain why, over time, in more egalitarian societies fiscal performance is better, stimulating greater accumulation of capital and higher growth.&lt;ref name="Davtyan"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/ira/wpaper/201405.html | title=Interrelation among Economic Growth, Income Inequality, and Fiscal Performance: Evidence from Anglo-Saxon Countries | publisher=Regional Quantitative Analysis Research Group | website=Research Institute of Applied Economics Working Paper 2014/05 | date=2014 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Davtyan, Karen | pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inequality and social class==
{{Main article|Social class}}

[[Socioeconomic status]] (SES) is a combined total measure of a person's work experience and of an individual's or family's economic and social position in relation to others, based on income, education, and occupation. It is often used as synonymous with social class, a set of hierarchical social categories that indicate an individual's or household's relative position in a stratified matrix of social relationships. Social class is delineated by a number of variables, some of which change across time and place. For [[Karl Marx]], there exist two major social classes with significant inequality between the two. The two are delineated by their relationship to the [[means of production]] in a given society. Those two classes are defined as the owners of the means of production and those who sell their labour to the owners of the means of production. In capitalistic societies, the two classifications represent the opposing social interests of its members, capital gain for the capitalists and good wages for the labourers, creating [[social conflict]].

[[Max Weber]] uses social classes to examine wealth and status. For him, social class is strongly associated with prestige and privileges. It may explain social reproduction, the tendency of social classes to remain stable across generations maintaining most of their inequalities as well. Such inequalities include differences in income, wealth, access to education, pension levels, social status, socioeconomic safety-net.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph. 2012. The Price of Inequality. New York, NY: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, social class can be defined as a large category of similarly ranked people located in a hierarchy and distinguished from other large categories in the hierarchy by such traits as occupation, education, income, and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Dennis. 2011: The American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality, 8th ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Western culture|Western societies]], inequalities are often broadly classified into three major divisions of social class: [[upper class]], [[middle class]], and [[Working class|lower class]]. Each of these classes can be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. "upper middle").&lt;ref name="Saunders1990"&gt;{{cite book | author-link=Peter Robert Saunders | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FK-004p0J_EC | title=Social Class and Stratification | publisher=Routledge | last=Saunders | first=Peter | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-415-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of different classes have varied access to financial resources, which affects their placement in the [[social stratification]] system.&lt;ref name="Doob13"&gt;Doob, B. Christopher (2013). Social Inequality and [[Social Stratification]] in US Society (1st ed.). Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education. {{ISBN|0-205-79241-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Class,  race, and gender are forms of stratification that bring inequality and determines the difference in allocation of societal rewards. Occupation is the primary determinant of a person class since it affects their lifestyle, opportunities, culture, and kind of people one associates with. Class based families include the lower class who are the poor in the society. They have limited opportunities. Working class are those people in blue-collar jobs and usually, affects the economic level of a nation. The Middle classes are those who rely mostly on wives' employment and depends on credits from the bank and medical coverage. The upper middle class are professionals who are strong because of economic resources and supportive institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houkamau|first=C.A.|year=2015|title=Looking Māori predicts decreased rates of home ownership: Institutional racism in housing based on perceived appearance|url=|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0118540|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0118540|pmid=25738961|pmc=4349451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the upper class usually are the wealthy families who have economic power due to accumulative wealth from families but not and not hard earned income.

[[Social stratification]] is the hierarchical arrangement of society about social class, wealth, political influence. A society can be politically stratified based on authority and power,  economically stratified based on income level and wealth, occupational stratification about one's occupation. Some roles for examples doctors, engineers, lawyers are highly ranked, and thus they give orders while the rest receive the orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Structure of social stratification in the United States|last=Beeghley|first=L.|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three systems of social stratification which are the caste system, estates system,  and class system. Castes system usually ascribed to children during birth whereby one receives the same stratification as of that of their parents. The caste system has been linked to religion and thus permanent. The stratification may be superior or inferior and thus influences the occupation and the social roles assigned to a person. Estate system is a state or society where people in this state were required to work on their land to receive some services like military protection. Communities ranked according to the nobility of their lords. The class system is about income inequality and socio-political status. People can move the classes when they increase their level of income or if they have authority. People are expected to maximize their innate abilities and possessions. Social stratification characteristics include its universal, social, ancient, it’s in diverse forms and also consequential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ideological support for the Indian caste system: Social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism and karma|last=Cotterill, S., Sidanius, J., Bhardwaj, A., &amp; Kumar, V.|publisher=Journal of Social and Political Psychology|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=98–116|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] variables most often used as an indicator of social inequality are [[income]] and [[wealth]]. In a given society, the distribution of individual or household accumulation of wealth tells us more about variation in [[well-being]] than does income, alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Who Rules America?

William | year=2013 | page=288 | isbn=978-0078026713}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), especially ''per capita'' GDP, is sometimes used to describe economic inequality at the [[International inequality|international]] or global level. A better measure at that level, however, is the [[Gini coefficient]], a [[Statistical dispersion#Measures of statistical dispersion|measure of statistical dispersion]] used to represent the distribution of a specific quantity, such as income or wealth, at a global level, among a nation's residents, or even within a metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;Gini, C. (1936). "On the Measure of Concentration with Special Reference to Income and Statistics", Colorado College Publication, General Series No. 208, 73–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Other widely used measures of economic inequality are the percentage of people living with under US$1.25 or $2 a day and the share of national income held by the wealthiest 10% of the population, sometimes called "the Palma" measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Is It All About the Tails?

==Patterns of inequality==
There are a number of socially defined characteristics of individuals that contribute to social status and, therefore, equality or inequality within a society. When researchers use quantitative variables such as income or wealth to measure inequality, on an examination of the data, patterns are found that indicate these other social variables contribute to income or wealth as [[intervening variable]]s. Significant inequalities in income and wealth are found when specific socially defined categories of people are compared. Among the most pervasive of these variables are [[sex]]/[[gender]], [[Race (human classification)|race]], and ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Hill1998"&gt;{{cite book | title="Toward a new vision: race, class and gender as categories of analysis and connection" in Social Class and Stratification: Classic Statements and Theoretical Debates | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | author=Collins, Patricia Hill | year=1998 | location=Boston | pages=231–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say, in societies wherein merit is considered to be the primary factor determining one's place or rank in the social order, that merit has no effect on variations in income or wealth. It is to say that these other socially defined characteristics can, and often do, intervene in the [[Value theory|valuation]] of merit.

===Gender inequality===
Gender as a social inequality is whereby women and men are treated differently due to masculinity and femininity by dividing labor, assigning roles, and responsibilities and allocating social rewards. Sex- and gender-based [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]], called [[sexism]], are major contributing factors to social inequality. Most societies, even [[agrarian society|agricultural ones]], have some [[sexual division of labour]] and [[Occupational segregation#Gendered division of labour|gender-based division of labour]] tends to increase during industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=New Family Values: Liberty, Equality, Diversity | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | author=Struening, Karen | year=2002 | location=New York | isbn=978-0-7425-1231-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on gender inequality is born out of the deepening division in the [[Gender role|roles]] assigned to men and women, particularly in the economic, political and educational spheres. Women are underrepresented in political activities and decision making processes in most states in both the [[Global North]] and Global South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/daw/index.html |title=About us |publisher=Un.org |date=31 December 2003 |accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender discrimination, especially concerning the lower social status of women, has been a topic of serious discussion not only within academic and activist communities but also by governmental agencies and international bodies such as the [[United Nations]]. These discussions seek to identify and remedy widespread, institutionalized barriers to access for women in their societies. By making use of [[gender analysis]], researchers try to understand the social expectations, responsibilities, resources and priorities of women and men within a specific context, examining the social, economic and environmental factors which influence their roles and decision-making capacity. By enforcing artificial separations between the social and economic roles of men and women, the lives of women and girls are negatively impacted and this can have the effect of limiting social and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Issac Kwaka Acheampong  |author2=Sidharta Sarkar |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Gender, Poverty &amp; Sustainable Livelihood|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural ideals about [[women's work]] can also affect men whose outward [[gender expression]] is considered "feminine" within a given society. [[Transgender]] and [[gender-variant]] persons may express their gender through their appearance, the statements they make, or official documents they present. In this context, gender normativity, which is understood as the social expectations placed on us when we present particular bodies, produces widespread cultural/institutional devaluations of trans identities, homosexuality and femininity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=" Fugitive flesh: Gender self-determination, queer abolition, and trans resistance" in E.

Women and persons whose gender identity does not conform to [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] beliefs about sex (only male and female) continue to face violence on global domestic, interpersonal, institutional and administrative scales. While first-wave [[Liberal feminism|Liberal Feminist]] initiatives raised awareness about the lack of fundamental rights and freedoms that women have access to, second-wave feminism (see also [[Radical Feminism]]) highlighted the structural forces that underlie gender-based violence. [[Masculinities]] are generally constructed so as to subordinate femininities and other expressions of gender that are not heterosexual, assertive and dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Connel|first=R.W.|title=Masculinities|year=1995 |origyear=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520246980}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Gender sociologist and author, [[Raewyn Connell]], discusses in her 2009 book, Gender, how masculinity is dangerous, heterosexual, violent and authoritative. These structures of masculinity ultimately contribute to the vast amounts of gendered violence, marginalization and suppression that women, queer, transgender, gender variant and gender non-conforming persons face. 
Some scholars suggest that women's underrepresentation in political systems speaks the idea that "formal citizenship does not always imply full social membership".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor 1993 p.504&lt;/ref&gt; Men, male bodies and expressions of masculinity are linked to ideas about work and citizenship. Others point out that patriarchal states tend top scale and claw back their social policies relative to the disadvantage of women.&lt;ref&gt;Mandel 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This process ensures that women encounter resistance into meaningful positions of power in institutions, administrations, and political systems and communities.

===Racial and ethnic inequality===
Racial or ethnic inequality is the result of hierarchical social distinctions between racial and ethnic categories within a society and often established based on characteristics such as skin color and other physical characteristics or an individual's place of origin or culture. Racism is whereby some races are more privileged and are allowed to venture into the labor market and are better compensated than others. Ethnicity is the privilege one enjoys for belonging to a particular ethnic group. Even though race has no biological connection, it has become a socially constructed category capable of restricting or enabling social status.

Racial inequality can also result in diminished opportunities for members of [[marginalized]] groups, which in turn can lead to [[Cycle of poverty|cycles of poverty]] and political marginalization. Racial and [[Ethnic group|ethnic categories]] become a [[Minority group|minority category]] in a society. Minority members in such a society are often subjected to discriminatory actions resulting from majority policies, including [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], exclusion, [[oppression]], [[exile|expulsion]], and [[genocide|extermination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Devising an Adequate System of Minority Protection: Individual Human Rights, Minority Rights and the Right to Self-Determination | publisher=Springer | author=Henrard, Kristen | year=2000 | location=New York | isbn=978-9041113597}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during the run-up to the 2012 federal elections in the United States, legislation in certain "[[battleground states]]" that claimed to target voter fraud had the effect of disenfranchising tens of thousands of primarily African American voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=R.

In the United States, [[Angela Davis]] argues that [[Incarceration in the United States|mass incarceration]] has been a modern tool of the state to [[Race in the United States criminal justice system|impose inequality, repression, and discrimination]] upon African American and Hispanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela Y.|title=Abolition Democracy: Beyond Prisons, Torture, and Empire|publisher=Seven Stories|isbn=978-1583226957|page=160|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[War on Drugs]] has been a campaign with disparate effects, ensuring the constant incarceration of poor, vulnerable, and marginalized populations in North America. Over a million African Americans are incarcerated in the US, many of whom have been convicted of a non-violent drug possession charge.{{cn|date=November 2017}} With the States of Colorado and Washington having legalized the possession of marijuana, drug reformists and anti-war on drugs lobbyists are hopeful that drug issues will be interpreted and dealt with from a healthcare perspective instead of a matter of criminal law. In Canada, Aboriginal, First Nations, and Indigenous persons represent over a quarter of the federal prison population, even though they only represent 3% of the country's population.

===Age inequality===
[[Age discrimination]] is defined as the unfair treatment of people with regard to promotions, recruitment, resources, or privileges because of their age. It is also known as [[ageism]]: the stereotyping of and discrimination against individuals or groups based upon their age. It is a set of beliefs, attitudes, norms, and values used to justify age-based prejudice, discrimination, and subordination.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, George R.; Katsiaficas, George N.; Kirkpatrick, Robert George; Mary Lou Emery (1987). Introduction to critical sociology. Ardent Media. p. 261. {{ISBN|978-0-8290-1595-9}}. Retrieved 28 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One form of ageism is [[adultism]], which is the discrimination against children and people under the legal adult age.&lt;ref&gt;Lauter And Howe (1971) Conspiracy of the Young. Meridian Press.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an act of adultism might be the policy of a certain establishment, restaurant, or place of business to not allow those under the legal adult age to enter their premises after a certain time or at all. While some people may benefit or enjoy these practices, some find them offensive and discriminatory. Discrimination against those under the age of 40 however is not illegal under the current U.S. Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/age.cfm | title=Age Discrimination}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As implied in the definitions above, treating people differently based upon their age is not necessarily discrimination. Virtually every society has [[Age stratification|age-stratification]], meaning that the age structure in a society changes as people begin to live longer and the [[Population ageing|population becomes older]]. In most cultures, there are different social role expectations for people of different ages to perform. Every society manages people's ageing by allocating certain roles for different age groups. Age discrimination primarily occurs when age is used as an unfair criterion for allocating more or less resources. Scholars of age inequality have suggested that certain social organizations favor particular age inequalities. For instance, because of their emphasis on training and maintaining productive citizens, modern capitalist societies may dedicate disproportionate resources to training the young and maintaining the middle-aged worker to the detriment of the elderly and the retired (especially those already disadvantaged by income/wealth inequality).&lt;ref name="Sargeant11"&gt;{{cite book | title=Age Discrimination and Diversity Multiple Discrimination from an Age Perspective | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Sargeant, Malcolm (ed.) | year=2011 | isbn=978-1107003774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern, technologically advanced societies, there is a tendency for both the young and the old to be relatively disadvantaged. However, more recently, in the United States the tendency is for the young to be most disadvantaged. For example, [[Poverty in the United States|poverty levels in the U.S.]] have been decreasing among people aged 65 and older since the early 1970s whereas the number children under 18 in poverty has steadily risen.&lt;ref name="Sargeant11"/&gt; Sometimes, the elderly have had the opportunity to build their wealth throughout their lives, younger people have the disadvantage of recently entering into or having not yet entered into the economic sphere. The larger contributor to this, however is the increase in the number of people over 65 receiving [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] benefits in the U.S.

When we compare income distribution among youth across the globe, we find that about half (48.5 percent) of the world's young people are confined to the bottom two income brackets as of 2007. This means that, out of the three billion persons under the age of 24 in the world as of 2007, approximately 1.5 billion were living in situations in which they and their families had access to just nine percent of global income. Moving up the income distribution ladder, children and youth do not fare much better: more than two-thirds of the world's youth have access to less than 20 percent of global wealth, with 86 percent of all young people living on about one-third of world income. For the just over 400 million youth who are fortunate enough to rank among families or situations at the top of the income distribution, however, opportunities improve greatly with more than 60 percent of global income within their reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/index_58230.html | title=Global inequality:  Beyond the bottom billion | publisher=UNICEF | website=UNICEF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLICY WORKING PAPER | date=April 2011 | accessdate=9 July 2014 |author1=Ortiz, Isabel  |author2=Matthew Cummins |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this does not exhaust the scope of age discrimination, in modern societies it is often discussed primarily with regards to the work environment. Indeed, non-participation in the labour force and the unequal access to rewarding jobs means that the elderly and the young are often subject to unfair disadvantages because of their age. On the one hand, the elderly are less likely to be involved in the workforce: At the same time, old age may or may not put one at a disadvantage in accessing positions of prestige. Old age may benefit one in such positions, but it may also disadvantage one because of negative ageist stereotyping of old people. On the other hand, young people are often disadvantaged from accessing prestigious or relatively rewarding jobs, because of their recent entry to the work force or because they are still completing their education. Typically, once they enter the labour force or take a part-time job while in school, they start at entry level positions with low level wages. Furthermore, because of their lack of prior work experience, they can also often be forced to take marginal jobs, where they can be taken advantage of by their employers. As a result, many older people have to face obstacles in their lives.

===Inequalities in health===
{{further information|Health equity|Inequality in disease|Social determinants of health in poverty|Diseases of poverty}}
Health inequalities can be defined as differences in health status or in the distribution of health determinants between different population groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Health Impact Assessment: Glossary of Terms Used|url=http://www.who.int/hia/about/glos/en/index1.html|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Health care====
Health inequalities are in many cases related to access to health care. In [[industrialized nations]], health inequalities are most prevalent in countries that have not implemented a [[universal health care]] system, such as the United States. Because the US health care system is heavily privatized, access to health care is dependent upon one's [[economic capital]]; Health care is not a right, it is a commodity that can be purchased through private insurance companies (or that is sometimes provided through an employer). The way health care is organized in the U.S. contributes to health inequalities based on gender, [[socioeconomic status]] and race/ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Eric R.|author2=Perry, Brea L. |title=Medical Sociology and Health Services Research: Past Accomplishments and Future Policy Challenges|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behaviour|year=2010|pages=107–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Wright and Perry assert, "social status differences in health care are a primary mechanism of health inequalities". In the United States, over 48 million people are without medical care coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Census|url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/data/incpovhlth/2011/highlights.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that almost one sixth of the population is without health insurance, mostly people belonging to the lower classes of society.

While universal access to health care may not completely eliminate health inequalities,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guessous|first=I.|last2=Gaspoz|first2=J.M.|last3=Theler|first3=J.M.|last4=Wolff|first4=H.|date=2012-11|title=High prevalence of forgoing healthcare for economic reasons in Switzerland: A population-based study in a region with universal health insurance coverage|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=55|issue=5|pages=521–527|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2012.08.005|pmid=22940614|issn=0091-7435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guessous|first=Idris|last2=Luthi|first2=Jean-Christophe|last3=Bowling|first3=Christopher Barrett|last4=Theler|first4=Jean-Marc|last5=Paccaud|first5=Fred|last6=Gaspoz|first6=Jean-Michel|last7=McClellan|first7=William|date=2014|title=Prevalence of Frailty Indicators and Association with Socioeconomic Status in Middle-Aged and Older Adults in a Swiss Region with Universal Health Insurance Coverage: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study|journal=Journal of Aging Research|language=en|volume=2014|pages=1–8|doi=10.1155/2014/198603|issn=2090-2204|pmc=4227447|pmid=25405033}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been shown that it greatly reduces them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veugeulers|first=P|author2=Yip, A. |title=Socioeconomic Disparities in Health Care Use: Does Universal Coverage Reduce Inequalities in Health?|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|year=2003|volume=57|issue=6|pages=107–119|doi=10.1136/jech.57.6.424|pmid=12775787|pmc=1732477}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, privatization gives individuals the 'power' to purchase their own health care (through private health insurance companies), but this leads to social inequality by only allowing people who have economic resources to access health care. Citizens are seen as consumers who have a 'choice' to buy the best health care they can afford; in alignment with neoliberal ideology, this puts the burden on the individual rather than the government or the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hacker|first=Jacob S.|title=The Great Risk Shift: The Assault on American Jobs, Families, Health Care, and Retirement - and How You Can Fight Back|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries that have a universal health care system, health inequalities have been reduced. In Canada, for example, equity in the availability of health services has been improved dramatically through [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]]. People don't have to worry about how they will pay health care, or rely on emergency rooms for care, since health care is provided for the entire population. However, inequality issues still remain. For example, not everyone has the same level of access to services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Karen R.|title=Health and Health Care in Essentials of Contemporary Sociology|year=1994|publisher=Copp Clark Longman|location=Toronto|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Inequalities in health are not, however, only related to access to health care. Even if everyone had the same level of access, inequalities may still remain. This is because health status is a product of more than just how much medical care people have available to them. While Medicare has equalized access to health care by removing the need for direct payments at the time of services, which improved the health of low status people, inequities in health are still prevalent in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=K.R.|title=The Inverse Care Law in Canada: Differential Access Under Universal Free Health Insurance|year=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=Toronto|pages=118–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to the state of the current social system, which bear other types of inequalities such as economic, racial and gender inequality.

A lack of health equity is also evident in the developing world, where the importance of equitable access to healthcare has been cited as crucial to achieving many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Health inequalities can vary greatly depending on the country one is looking at. Health equity is needed in order to live a healthier and more sufficient life within society. Inequalities in health lead to substantial effects, that is burdensome or the entire society. Inequalities in health are often associated with socioeconomic status and access to health care. Health inequities can occur when the distribution of public health services is unequal. For example, in Indonesia in 1990, only 12% of government spending for health was for services consumed by the poorest 20% of households, while the wealthiest 20% consumed 29% of the government subsidy in the health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Bank|title=World Development Report|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to health care is heavily influenced by socioeconomic status as well, as wealthier population groups have a higher probability of obtaining care when they need it. A study by Makinen et al. (2000) found that in the majority of developing countries they looked at, there was an upward trend by [[Quantile|quintile]] in health care use for those reporting illness. Wealthier groups are also more likely to be seen by doctors and to receive medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862000000100006&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=pt | title=Inequalities in Health Care Use and Expenditures: Empirical Data from Eight Developing Countries and Countries in Transition | journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume=78 | issue=1 | pages=55–65 | date=January 2000 | last=Mankinen, M.| doi=10.1590/S0042-96862000000100006| pmid=10686733 | pmc=2560608 |display-authors=etal| doi-broken-date=2018-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Food====
There has been considerable research in recent years regarding a phenomenon known as [[food desert]]s, in which low access to fresh, healthy food in a neighborhood leads to poor consumer choices and options regarding diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA Defines Food Deserts|url=http://americannutritionassociation.org/newsletter/usda-defines-food-deserts|website=American Nutrition Association|publisher=American Nutrition Association|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely thought that food deserts are significant contributors to the childhood obesity epidemic in the United States and many other countries.

The economies of the world have [[Development theory|developed]] unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. This was represented by a type of [[North–South divide]] that existed after [[World War II]] between [[First world]], more [[developed country|developed]], [[industrialized]], wealthy countries and [[Third world]] countries, primarily as measured by GDP. From around 1980, however, through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly [[developing countries]], [[life expectancies]] began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | title=How much do you know about the world? | publisher=BBC | date=2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Rosling, Hans| work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are numerous limitations of GDP as an economic indicator of social "well-being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neweconomyworkinggroup.org/visions/living-wealth-indicators/gdp-flawed-measure-progress | title=GDP: A Flawed Measure of Progress | publisher=New Economy Working Group | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, over time, after [[World War II]] the global Gini coefficient sat at just under .45. Between around 1959 to 1966, the global Gini increased sharply, to a peak of around .48 in 1966. After falling and leveling off a couple of times during a period from around 1967 to 1984, the Gini began to climb again in the mid-eighties until reaching a high or around .54 in 2000 then jumped again to around .70 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Two Faces of Globalization | author=Bronko, Milanovic | journal=World Development | year=2003 | volume=31 | issue=4 | pages=667–683 | doi=10.1016/s0305-750x(03)00002-0| citeseerx=10.1.1.454.7785 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed— between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally. Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark.

[[File:Berg Ostry 2011 Chart 4.gif|thumb|left|Of the factors influencing the duration of [[economic growth]] in both developed and developing countries, [[Economic inequality|income equality]] has a more beneficial impact than trade openness, sound political institutions, and foreign investment.&lt;ref name=BergOstryEE&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Berg |first= Andrew G. |last2= Ostry |first2= Jonathan D. |year= 2011 |title= Equality and Efficiency |journal= Finance and Development |volume= 48 |issue= 3 |url= http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2011/09/berg.htm |accessdate= 10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The concept of [[economic growth]] is fundamental in [[capitalist]] economies. [[Productivity]] must grow as population grows and capital must grow to feed into increased productivity. Investment of capital leads to [[returns on investment]] (ROI) and increased [[capital accumulation]]. The hypothesis that economic inequality is a necessary precondition for economic growth has been a mainstay of liberal economic theory. Recent research, particularly over the first two decades of the 21st century, has called this basic assumption into question.&lt;ref name="UNICEF2011" /&gt; While growing inequality does have a positive correlation with economic growth under specific sets of conditions, inequality in general is not positively correlated with economic growth and, under some conditions, shows a negative correlation with economic growth.&lt;ref name="Davtyan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milanovic2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ub.edu/histeco/pdf/milanovic.pdf | title=Global income inequality: the past two centuries and implications for 21st century | publisher=World Bank | date=Autumn 2011 | accessdate=10 July 2014 | author=Milanovic, Branko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ostry2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=41291 | title=Redistribution, Inequality, and Growth | publisher=International Monetary Fund | date=April 2014 | accessdate=10 July 2014 | author=Ostry, Jonathan D. and Andrew Berg, Charalambos G. Tsangarides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milanovic (2011) points out that overall, global inequality between countries is more important to growth of the world economy than inequality within countries.&lt;ref name="Milanovic2011" /&gt; While global economic growth may be a policy priority, recent evidence about regional and national inequalities cannot be dismissed when more local economic growth is a policy objective. The recent [[financial crisis]] and [[global recession]] hit countries and shook [[Global financial system|financial systems all over the world]]. This led to the implementation of large-scale fiscal expansionary interventions and, as a result, to massive public debt issuance in some countries. Governmental bailouts of the banking system further burdened fiscal balances and raises considerable concern about the fiscal solvency of some countries. Most governments want to keep deficits under control but rolling back the expansionary measures or cutting spending and raising taxes implies an enormous wealth transfer from tax payers to the private financial sector. Expansionary fiscal policies shift resources and causes worries about growing inequality within countries. Moreover, recent data confirm an ongoing trend of increasing income inequality since the early nineties. Increasing inequality within countries has been accompanied by a redistribution of economic resources between developed economies and emerging markets.&lt;ref name="Davtyan" /&gt; Davtyn, et al. (2014) studied the interaction of these fiscal conditions and changes in fiscal and economic policies with income inequality in the UK, Canada, and the US. They find income inequality has negative effect on economic growth in the case of the UK but a positive effect in the cases of the US and Canada. Income inequality generally reduces government net lending/borrowing for all the countries. Economic growth, they find, leads to an increase of income inequality in the case of the UK and to the decline of inequality in the cases of the US and Canada. At the same time, economic growth improves government net lending/borrowing in all the countries. Government spending leads to the decline in inequality in the UK but to its increase in the US and Canada.&lt;ref name="Davtyan" /&gt;

Following the results of Alesina and Rodrick (1994), Bourguignon (2004), and Birdsall (2005) show that developing countries with high inequality tend to grow more slowly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Distributive Politics and Economic Growth |author1=Alesina, A.  |author2=D.

For 131 countries for which they could estimate the change in Gini index values between 1990 and 2008, they find that those countries that increased levels of inequality experienced slower annual per capita GDP growth over the same time period. Noting a lack of data for national wealth, they build an index using ''[[Forbes]]'' list of billionaires by country normalized by GDP and validated through correlation with a Gini coefficient for wealth and the share of wealth going to the top decile. They find that many countries generating low rates of economic growth are also characterized by a high level of wealth inequality with wealth concentration among a class of entrenched elites. They conclude that extreme inequality in the distribution of wealth globally, regionally and nationally, coupled with the negative effects of higher levels of income disparities, should make us question current economic development approaches and examine the need to place equity at the center of the development agenda.&lt;ref name="UNICEF2011" /&gt;

Ostry, et al. (2014) reject the hypothesis that there is a major trade-off between a reduction of income inequality (through [[Redistribution (economics)|income redistribution]]) and economic growth. If that were the case, they hold, then redistribution that reduces income inequality would on average be bad for growth, taking into account both the direct effect of higher redistribution and the effect of the resulting lower inequality. Their research shows rather the opposite: increasing income inequality always has a significant and, in most cases, negative effect on economic growth while redistribution has an overall pro-growth effect (in one sample) or no growth effect. Their conclusion is that increasing inequality, particularly when inequality is already high, results in low growth, if any, and such growth may be unsustainable over long periods.

Piketty and Saez (2014) note that there are important differences between income and wealth inequality dynamics. First, wealth concentration is always much higher than income concentration. The top 10 percent of wealth share typically falls in the 60 to 90 percent range of all wealth, whereas the top 10 percent income share is in the 30 to 50 percent range. The bottom 50 percent wealth share is always less than 5 percent, whereas the bottom 50 percent income share generally falls in the 20 to 30 percent range. The bottom half of the population hardly owns any wealth, but it does earn appreciable income:The inequality of labor income can be high, but it is usually much less extreme. On average, members of the bottom half of the population, in terms of wealth, own less than one-tenth of the average wealth. The inequality of labor income can be high, but it is usually much less extreme. Members of the bottom half of the population in income earn about half the average income. In sum, the concentration of capital ownership is always extreme, so that the very notion of capital is fairly abstract for large segments—if not the majority—of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Inequality in the long run | journal=Science | year=2014 | volume=344 | issue=6186 | pages=838–43 | doi=10.1126/science.1251936 | pmid=24855258 | last1 = Piketty | first1 = T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piketty (2014) finds that wealth-income ratios, today, seem to be returning to very high levels in low economic growth countries, similar to what he calls the "classic patrimonial" wealth-based societies of the 19th century wherein a minority lives off its wealth while the rest of the population works for subsistence living. He surmises that wealth accumulation is high because growth is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Capital in the 21st century | publisher=Belknap Press | author=Piketty, Thomas | year=2014 | isbn=978-0674430006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The '''Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition''' ({{lang-es|Tribunal del Santo Oficio de la Inquisición|links=no}}), commonly known as the '''Spanish Inquisition''' (''Inquisición española''), was established in 1478 by [[Catholic Monarchs]] [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]]. It was intended to maintain [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] orthodoxy in their kingdoms and to replace the [[Medieval Inquisition]], which was under [[Pope|Papal control]]. It became the most substantive of the three different manifestations of the wider [[Inquisition|Catholic Inquisition]] along with the [[Roman Inquisition]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]. The "Spanish Inquisition" may be defined broadly, operating in Spain and in all Spanish colonies and territories, which included the Canary Islands, the [[Spanish Netherlands]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and all Spanish possessions in [[Spanish America|North, Central, and South America]]. According to modern estimates, around 150,000 were prosecuted for various offenses during the three centuries of duration of the Spanish Inquisition, out of which between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed.

The Inquisition was originally intended primarily to identify [[heretics]] among those who converted from Judaism and Islam to Catholicism.

==Previous Inquisitions==
The [[Inquisition]] was created through [[papal bull]], ''[[Ad Abolendam]]'', issued at the end of the 12th century by [[Pope Lucius III]] to combat the [[Albigensian|Albigensian heresy]] in southern France. There were a large number of tribunals of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Papal Inquisition]] in various European kingdoms during the Middle Ages through different diplomatic and political means. In the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], a tribunal of the Papal Inquisition was established by the statute of ''Excommunicamus'' of Pope [[Gregory IX]], in 1232, during the era of the [[Albigensian]] heresy, as a condition for peace with Aragon. The Inquisition was ill-received by the Aragonese, which led to prohibitions against insults or attacks on it. Rome was particularly concerned about the 'heretical' influence of the Iberian peninsula's large Muslim and Jewish population on the Catholic. It pressed the kingdoms to accept the Papal Inquisition after Aragon. Navarra conceded in the 13th century and Portugal by the end of the 14th, however its 'Roman Inquisition' was famously inactive. Castile refused steadily, trusting on its prominent position in Europe and its military power to keep the Pope's interventionism in check. By the end of the Middle Ages, [[England]], due to distance and voluntary compliance, and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (future part of Spain) due to resistance and power, were the only Western European kingdoms to successfully resist establishment of the Inquisition in their realms.

===Medieval Inquisition in Aragon===
Although [[Raymond of Penyafort]] was not an inquisitor, as a canon lawyer and the king's advisor, [[James I of Aragon]], had often consulted him on questions of law regarding the practices of the Inquisition in the king's domains.
"...[T]he lawyer's deep sense of justice and equity, combined with the worthy Dominican's sense of compassion, allowed him to steer clear of the excesses that were found elsewhere in the formative years of the inquisitions into heresy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BEfrDPxlraYC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=Raymond+of+Penyafort+%2B+inquisition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VZ5vbpyeWK&amp;sig=DNuuDEXkW1ypFlYVBrL5Ugb0P8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwxaWi7KPLAhXHw4MKHbH7Dx8Q6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Raymond%20of%20Penyafort%20%20%20inquisition&amp;f=false Smith, Damian J., ''Crusade, Heresy and Inquisition in the Lands of the Crown of Aragon'', Brill, 2010] {{ISBN|9789004182899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its early implantation, the Papal inquisition was greatly resisted within the crown of Aragon by both population and monarchs.
With time, its importance was diluted, and, by the middle of the fifteenth century, it was almost forgotten although still there according to the law.

Regarding the living conditions of minorities, the kings of Aragon and other monarchies imposed some discriminatory taxation of religious minorities, so false conversions were a way of tax evasion.

In addition to said discriminatory legislation, Aragon had laws specifically targeted at protecting minorities. For example, crusades attacking Jewish or Muslim subjects of the King of Aragon while on their way to fight in the reconquest were punished with death by hanging. Up to the 14th century, the census and weddings records show an absolute lack of concern with avoiding intermarriage or blood mixture so present in other areas. Both the Roman Inquisition and neighbouring Christian powers showed discomfort with these two aspects of Aragonese law and lack of concern with ethnicity, but to little effect.
High-ranking officials of Jewish religion were not as common as in Castile, but were not unheard of either.&lt;ref&gt;Parrilla, Gonzalo Fernández, Miguel Hernando De Larramendi, and José Sangrador Gil.

===Medieval Inquisition in Castile===

There was never a tribunal of the Papal Inquisition in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], nor any inquisition during the Middle Ages. Members of the [[episcopate]] were charged with surveillance of the faithful and punishment of transgressors, always under the direction of the king.

During the Middle Ages, in Castile, little to no attention was paid to heresy by the Catholic ruling class, or by the population. Castile didn´t see proliferation of anti-Jew pamphlets like England and France did during the 13th and 14th century, and those who have been found had modified, somehow watered down versions form the original stories&lt;ref&gt;Hassán, Iacob; Izquierdo Benito, Ricardo (2001). Universidad de Castilla La Mancha, ed. Judíos en la literatura española(Jews in Spanish Literature). España&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2018}}. Jews and Muslims were tolerated and generally allowed to follow their traditional customs in domestic matters.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The legislation regarding Muslims and Jews in Castilian territory varied greatly, becoming more intolerant during the period of great instability and dynastic wars that occurred by the end of the 14th century. The Castilian law is particularly difficult to summarize since due to the model of the free [[Royal Villas]] mayors and the population of border areas had the right to create their own [[fueros]] (law) that varied from one villa to the next. In general, the Castilian model was parallel to the initial model of Islamic Spain. Non-Catholics were subject to discriminatory legislation regarding taxation and some other specific discriminatory legislation-such as prohibition of wearing silk or "flashy clothes" &lt;ref name="Suárez Fernández 2012"&gt;Suárez Fernández, Luis (2012). La expulsión de los judíos. Un problema europeo. Barcelona: Ariel.&lt;/ref&gt;- that varied from county to county, but were left alone besides that. Forced conversion of minorities was against the law, and so was the belief in the existence of witchcraft, oracles or similar superstitions. In general, all "people from the book" were permitted to practice their own customs and religions as far as they did not attempt proselytizing on the Christian population. Jews particularly had surprising freedoms and protections compared to other areas of Europe and were allowed to hold high public offices such as the counselor, treasurer or secretary for the crown.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

During most of the medieval period intermarriage with converts was allowed and encouraged. The intellectual cooperation between religions was the norm in Castile. Some examples are the [[Toledo School of Translators]] from the 11th century. Jews and moriscos were allowed to hold high offices in the administration.&lt;ref name="Suárez Fernández 2012"/&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2018}}

A tightening of the laws to protect the right of Jews to collect loans during the Medieval Crisis, was one of the causes of the revolt against [[Peter the Cruel]] and catalyst of the anti-semitic episodes of 1490 in Castile, a kingdom that had shown no significant antisemitic backlash to the black death and drought crisis of the early 14th century. Even after the sudden increase in hostility towards other religions that the kingdom experienced after the 14th century crisis, which clearly worsened the living conditions of non-Catholics in Castile, it remained one of the most tolerant kingdoms in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, César Mantilla.

The kingdom had serious tensions with Rome regarding the Church's attempts to extend its authority into it. A focuss of conflict was Castilian resistance to truly abandon the [[mozarabic rite]], and the refusal to grant Papal control over Reconquest land (a request Aragon and Portugal conceded). These conflicts added up with a strong resistance to allow the creation of an Inquisition, and the kingdom´s general willingness to accept the heretics that came in seeking refuge from prosecution in France.

==Creation of the Spanish Inquisition==
There are several hypotheses of what prompted the creation of the tribunal after [[La Convivencia|centuries of outstanding tolerance]] (within the context of medieval Europe). The truth is probably a combination of varieties of them.

===The "Too Multi-Religious" hypothesis===
The Spanish Inquisition (Inquisición Española) can be interpreted as a response to the multi-religious nature of Spanish society following the [[Reconquista|reconquest]] of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the Muslim [[Moors]]. After invading in 711, large areas of the Iberian Peninsula were ruled by Muslims until 1250, when they were restricted to Granada, which fell in 1492. However, the Reconquista did not result in the total expulsion of Muslims from Spain, since they, along with Jews, were tolerated by the ruling Christian elite. Large cities, especially [[Seville]], [[Valladolid]] and [[Barcelona]], had significant Jewish populations centered in [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Juderia]], but in the coming years the Muslims were increasingly subjugated by alienation and torture.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Post-reconquest medieval Spain has been characterized by [[Americo Castro]] as a society of relatively peaceful co-existence (''convivencia'') punctuated by occasional conflict among the ruling Catholics and the Jews and Muslims. However, as historian Henry Kamen notes, the "so-called convivencia was always a relationship between unequals."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their legal inequality, there was a long tradition of Jewish service to the crown of Aragon and Jews occupied many important posts, both religious and political. Castile itself had an unofficial [[rabbi]]. Ferdinand's father [[John II of Castile|John II]] named the Jewish [[Abiathar Crescas]] to be Court [[Astronomer]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Antisemitic]] attitudes increased all over Europe during the late 13th century and throughout the 14th century. England and France expelled their [[Jewish]] populations in 1290 and 1306 respectively.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=79}}  At the same time, during the [[Reconquista]], Spain's anti-Jewish sentiment steadily increased. This prejudice climaxed in the summer of 1391 when violent anti-Jewish riots broke out in Spanish cities like [[Barcelona]]{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=82}}  To linguistically distinguish them from non-converted or long-established Catholic families, new converts were called [[conversos]], or New Catholics.

According to Don [[Hasdai Crescas]], persecution against Jews began in earnest in [[Seville]] in 1391, on the 1st day of the lunar month Tammuz (June).&lt;ref name="Crescas"&gt;Letter of Hasdai Crescas, ''Shevaṭ Yehudah'' by [[Solomon ibn Verga]] (ed. Dr. M. Wiener), Hannover 1855, pp. 128 – 130, or pp. 138 - 140 in [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/37804 PDF]; Fritz Kobler, ''Letters of the Jews through the Ages'', London 1952, pp. 272–75; {{cite book|last=Mitre Fernández|first=Emilio|title=Los judíos de Castilla en tiempo de Enrique III : el pogrom de 1391|language=es |trans-title=The Castilian Jews at the time of Henry III: the 1391 pogrom |publisher=Valladolid University| editor=Secretariado de Publicaciones e Intercambio Editorial|year=1994|isbn=978-84-7762-449-3}}; [[Solomon ibn Verga]], [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/39487 ''Shevaṭ Yehudah'' (The Sceptre of Judah)], Lvov 1846, p. 76 in PDF.&lt;/ref&gt; From there the violence spread to [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], and by the 17th day of the same lunar month, it had reached [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] (called then by Jews after its Arabic name "Ṭulayṭulah") in the region of [[Old Castile|Castile]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[Hasdai Crescas]] to the congregations of [[Avignon]], published as an appendix to Wiener's edition of [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/37804 ''Shevaṭ Yehudah''] of Solomon ibn Verga, in which he names the Jewish communities affected by the persecution of 1391. See pages 138 – 140 in PDF (Hebrew); Fritz Kobler, ''Letters of the Jews through the Ages'', London 1952, pp. 272–75.&lt;/ref&gt; From there, the violence had spread to [[Majorca]] and by the 1st day of the lunar month Elul it had also reached the Jews of [[Barcelona]] in [[Catalonia]], where the slain were estimated at two-hundred and fifty. So, too, many Jews who resided in the neighboring provinces of [[Province of Lleida|Lérida]] and Gironda and in the kingdom of  [[Valencia, Spain|València]] had been affected,&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon ibn Verga]], [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/39487 ''Shevaṭ Yehudah'' (The Sceptre of Judah)], Lvov 1846, pp. 41 (end) – 42 in PDF); {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=17}}. Kamen cites approximate numbers for Valencia (250) and Barcelona (400), but no solid data about Córdoba.&lt;/ref&gt; as were also the Jews of [[Al-Andalus]] (Andalucía),&lt;ref&gt;According to Gedaliah Ibn Yechia, these disturbances were caused by a malicious report spread about the Jews. See: [[Gedaliah ibn Yahya ben Joseph|Gedaliah Ibn Yechia]], [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/6618 ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah''] Jerusalem 1962, p. רסח, in PDF p. 277 (top) (Hebrew); Solomon ibn Verga, ''Shevat Yehudah'', Lvov 1846 (p. 76 in PDF) (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; whereas many died a martyr’s death, while others converted in order to save themselves.

Encouraged by the preaching of [[Ferrand Martinez]], [[Archdeacon]] of [[Ecija]], the general unrest affected nearly all of the Jews in Spain, during which time an estimated 200,000 Jews changed their religion or else concealed their religion, becoming known in Hebrew as "Anūsim",&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Zacuto]], ''Sefer Yuchasin'', [[Cracow]] 1580 (q.v. [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/11550 ''Sefer Yuchasin''], p. 266 in PDF) (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, "those who are compelled [to hide their religion]." Only a handful of the more principal persons of the Jewish community managed to escape, who had found refuge among the viceroys in the outlying towns and districts.&lt;ref name="Crescas" /&gt;

Forced baptism was contrary to the law of the Catholic Church, and theoretically anybody who had been forcibly baptized could legally return to Judaism. Legal definitions of the time theoretically acknowledged that a forced baptism was not a valid sacrament, but confined this to cases where it was literally administered by physical force: a person who had consented to baptism under threat of death or serious injury was still regarded as a voluntary convert, and accordingly forbidden to revert to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond of Peñafort]], ''Summa'', lib. 1 p.33, citing D.45 c.5.&lt;/ref&gt; After the public violence, many of the converted "felt it safer to remain in their new religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, after 1391, a new social group appeared and were referred to as ''[[conversos]]'' or ''New Christians''. Many ''conversos'', now freed from the anti-Semitic restrictions imposed on Jewish employment, attained important positions in fifteenth century Spain, including positions in the government and in the Church. Among many others, physicians [[Andrés Laguna]] and Francisco Lopez Villalobos (Ferdinand's court physician), writers [[Juan del Enzina]], [[Juan de Mena]], [[Diego de Valera]] and [[Alonso de Palencia]], and bankers [[Luis de Santangel]] and Gabriel Sanchez (who financed the voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]]) were all ''conversos''. ''Conversos'' – not without opposition – managed to attain high positions in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, at times becoming severe detractors of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Notably Bishop [[Pablo de Santa Maria]], author of ''Scrutinium Scripturarum'', [[Jeronimo de Santa Fe]] (''Hebraomastix'') and [[Pedro de la Caballeria]] (''Zelus Christi contra Judaeos''). All three were ''conversos''. ({{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=39}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Some even received titles of nobility, and as a result, during the following century some works attempted to demonstrate that virtually all of the nobles of Spain were descended from Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;Notably the ''Libro verde de Aragon'' and ''Tizón de la nobleza de España'' (cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=38}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Enforcement Across Borders" hypothesis===
According to this hypothesis, the Inquisition was created to standardize the variety of laws and many jurisdictions Spain was divided into. It would be an administrative program analogous to the [[Santa Hermandad]] (the "Holy Brotherhood", a law enforcement body, answering to the crown, that prosecuted thieves and criminals across counties in a way local county authorities could not, ancestor to the [[Guardia Civil]]), an institution that would guarantee uniform prosecution of crimes against royal laws across all local jurisdictions.

The Kingdom of Castile had been prosperous and successful in Europe thanks in part to the unusual authority and control the king exerted over the nobility, which ensured political stability and kept the kingdom from being weakened by in-fighting (as was the case in England, for example). However, under the [[Trastamara]] dynasty, both the kings of Castile and Aragon had lost power to the great nobles, who now formed dissenting and conspiratorial factions. Taxation and varying privileges differed from county to county, and powerful noble families constantly extorted the kings to attain further concessions, particularly in Aragon.

The main goals of the reign of the Catholic Monarchs were to strengthen royal power to guarantee stability, and to unite their two kingdoms. In this, they sought to further unify the laws of their realms and reduce the power of the nobility in certain local areas. They attained this partially by raw military strength, by creating a combined army between the two of them that could outmatch the army of most noble coalitions in the Peninsula. However, it was impossible to change the entire laws of both realms by force alone, and due to reasonable suspicion of one another, the monarchs kept their kingdoms separate during their lifetimes. The only way to unify both kingdoms and ensure that Isabella, Ferdinand, and their descendants maintained the power of both kingdoms without uniting them in life was to find, or create, an executive, legislative and judicial arm directly under the Crown empowered to act in both kingdoms. This goal, the hypothesis goes, might have given birth to the Spanish Inquisition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Spanish Inquisition: a History. Joseph Pérez - Yale University Press - 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious organization to oversee this role was obvious: Catholicism was the only institution common to both kingdoms, and the only one with enough popular support that the nobility could not easily attack it. Through the Spanish Inquisition, Isabella and Ferdinand created a personal police force and personal code of law that rested above the structure of their respective realms without altering it or mixing them, and that could operate freely in both. As the Inquisition had the backing of both kingdoms, it would exist independent of both the nobility and local interests of either kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, Joseph (2012) [2009]. Breve Historia de la Inquisición en España. Barcelona: Crítica. {{ISBN|978-84-08-00695-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, the prosecution of heretics would be secondary, or simply not considered different at the time from the prosecution of conspirators, traitors, or groups of any kind who planned to resist royal authority. At the time, royal authority rested on divine right and on oaths of loyalty held before God, so the connection between religious deviation and political disloyalty would appear obvious. This hypothesis is supported by the disproportionately high representation of the nobility and high clergy among those investigated by the Inquisition, as well as by the many administrative and civil crimes the inquisition prosecuted. The Inquisition prosecuted the counterfeiting of royal seals and currency, ensured the effective transmission of the orders of the kings, and verified the authenticity of official documents traveling through the kingdoms, especially from one kingdom to the other. See "Non-Religious Crimes".&lt;ref&gt;Canessa De Sanguinetti, Marta. El Bien Nacer: Limpieza De Oficios Y Limpieza De Sangre : Raíces Ibéricas De Un Mal Latinoamericano. Taurus, Ediciones Santillana, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===The "Placate Europe" hypothesis===

At a time in which most of Europe had already [[History of the Jews in the Middle Ages|expelled the Jews from the Christian kingdoms]] the "dirty blood" of Spaniards was met with open suspicion and contempt by the rest of Europe. As the world became smaller and foreign relations became more relevant to stay in power this foreign image of "being the seed of jews and moors" may have become a problem. In addition, the coup that allowed Isabella to take the throne from [[Joana of Portugal|Joana of Avis]] and the Catholic Monarchs to marry had estranged Castile from Portugal, its historical ally, and created the need for new relationships. Similarly, Aragon's ambitions lay in control of the Mediterranean and the defence against France. As their [[Catholic Monarchs|policy of royal marriages]] proved, the Catholic Monarchs were deeply concerned about France's growing power and expected to create strong dynastic alliances across Europe. In this scenario, the Iberian reputation of being too tolerant was a problem. 
Despite the prestige earned through the reconquest ([[reconquista]]) that foreign image on Spaniards coexisted with an almost universal image of heretics and "bad Christians" due to the long coexistence between the three religions, they had accepted in their lands. Anti-Jews stereotypes created to justify or prompt the expulsion and expropriation of the European Jews were also applied to Spaniards in most European courts, and the idea of them being "greedy, gold-thirsty, cruel and violent", "like Jews", due to the "Jewish and Moorish blood" was prevalent in Europe before America was discovered by Europeans. Chronicles by foreign travelers circulated through Europe, describing the tolerant ambiance reigning in the court of Isabela and Ferdinand and how Moors and Jews were free to go about without anyone trying to convert them. Past and common clashes between the Pope and the kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, regarding the Inquisition in Castile's case and regarding South Italy in Aragon's case, also reinforced their image of heretics in the international courts. These accusations and image could have direct political and military consequences at the time, especially considering that the union two powerful kingdoms were a particularly delicate moment that could prompt the fear and violent reactions from neighbors, even more, if combined with the expansion of the Ottoman Turks on the Mediterranean.
The creation of the Inquisition and the expulsion of both Jews and Moriscos may have been part of a strategy to whitewash the image of Spain and ease international fears regarding Spain's allegiance. In this scenario, the creation of the Inquisition could have been part of the catholic's Monarch strategy to " turn" away from African allies and "towards" Europe, a tool to turn both actual Spain and Spanish image more European and improve relations with the Pope.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Elvira, Roca Barea María, and Arcadi Espada. Imperiofobia Y Leyenda Negra: Roma, Rusia, Estados Unidos Y El Imperio Español. Madrid: Siruela, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Ottoman Scare" hypothesis===

No matter if any of the previous hypotheses were already operating in the minds of the monarchs, the alleged discovery of Morisco plots to support a possible Ottoman invasion were crucial factors in their decision to create the Inquisition.

At this time, the Ottoman Empire was in expansion and making its power noticeable in the Mediterranean and North Africa. At the same time, the Aragonese Mediterranean Empire was crumbling under debt and war exhaustion. Ferdinand reasonably feared that he would not be capable of repelling an Ottoman attack to Spain's shores, especially if the Ottomans had internal help. The regions with the highest concentration of Moriscos were those close to the common naval crossings between Spain and Africa. If the weakness of the Aragonese Naval Empire was combined with the resentment of the higher nobility against the monarchs, the dynastic [[War of the Castilian Succession|claims of Portugal on Castile]] and the two monarch's exterior politic that turned away from Morocco and other African nations in favor of Europe, the fear of a second Muslim invasion - and thus a second Muslim occupation was hardly unfounded. This fear may have been the base reason for the expulsion of those citizens who had either a religious reason to support the invasion of the Ottomans (Moriscos) or no particular religious reason to not do it (Jews). The Inquisition might have been part of the preparations to enforce these measures and ensure their effectiveness by rooting out false converts that would still pose a threat of foreign espionage.&lt;ref&gt;Abou Al Fadl, K. (1994). Islamic law and Muslim minorities: the juristic discourse on Muslim minorities from the second/eight to the eleventh/seventeenth centuries. Islamic Law and Society, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goosenes, A. (1997). Les inquisitions modernes dans les Pays-Bas meridionaux. 1520-1633. 2 vols. Bruselas&lt;/ref&gt;

In favor of this view there is the obvious military sense it makes, and the many early attempts of peaceful conversion and persuasion that the Monarchs used at the beginning of their reign, and the sudden turn towards the creation of the Inquisition and the edicts of expulsion when those initial attempts failed. The [[History of Naples|conquest of Naples]] by the [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba|Gran Capitan]] is also proof of an interest in Mediterranean expansion and re-establishment of Spanish power in that sea that was bound to generate frictions with the Ottoman Empire and other African nations. So, the Inquisition would have been created as a permanent body to prevent the existence of citizens with religious sympathies with African nations now that rivalry with them had been deemed unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;Boronat, P. (1901). Los moriscos españoles y su expulsión. 2 vols. Valencia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical and Religious Reasons===

The creation of the Spanish Inquisition would be consistent with the most important political philosophers of the [[Florentine School]], with whom the kings were known to have contact ([[Guicciardini]], [[Pico della Mirandola]], [[Machiavelli]], Segni, Pitti, Nardi, Varchi…). Both Guicciardini and Machiavelli defended the importance of centralization and unification in order to create a strong state capable of repelling foreign invasions, and also warned of the dangers of excessive social uniformity to the creativity and innovation of a nation. Machiavelli considered piety and morals desirable for the subjects but not so much for the ruler, whom should use them as a way to unify its population. He also warned of the nefarious influence of a corrupt church in the creation of a selfish population and middle nobility,  which had fragmented the peninsula and made it unable to resist either France or Aragon. German philosophers at the time were spreading the importance of a vassal to share the religion of their lord.

The Inquisition may have just been the result of putting these ideas into practice. The use of religion as a unifying factor across a land that was allowed to stay diverse and maintain different laws in other respects, and the creation of the Inquisition to enforce laws across it, maintain said religious unity and control the local elites were consistent with most of those teachings.

Alternatively, the enforcement of Catholicism across the realm might indeed be the result of simple religious devotion or a belief in a mystic religious ditty by the monarchs. The recent scholarship on the expulsion of the Jews leans towards the belief of religious motivations being at the bottom of it.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Nancy Rubin. Isabella of Castile: The First Renaissance Queen. New York: ASJA Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; but considering the reports on Ferdinand's political persona that is unlikely to be the only reason. Ferdinand was described, among others, by Machiavelli, as "a man who didn't know the meaning of piety, but who made political use of it and would had achieved little if he had really known it." He was Machiavelli's main inspiration while writing [[The Prince]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, Robert. Machiavelli. Abigdon, Oxon: Routledge, Tylor &amp;, 2013. pp83-120 (the quote is paraphrased)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Keeping the Pope in Check" hypothesis===

The hierarchy of the Catholic Church had made many attempts during the Middle Ages to take over Christian Spain politically, such as claiming the Church's ownership over all land reconquered from non Christians (a claim that was rejected by Castille but accepted by Aragon and Portugal). In the past, the papacy had tried and partially succeeded, in forcing out of Iberia the [[mozarabic rite]]. Its meddling attempts had been pivotal for [[Albigensian crusade|Aragon's lose of Rosellon]]. The [[Crusade of Aragon|meddling regarding Aragon's control over South Italy]] was even stronger historically. In their lifetime, the Catholic Monarchs had [[Carrillo de Acuña|problems with]] [[Pope Paul II]], a very strong proponent of absolute authority of the church over the Kings. Carrillo actively opposed them both and often used Spain's "mixed blood" as an excuse to intervene. The papacy and the monarch of Europe had been involved in a  [[Investiture controversy|war for power all through the high Middle Ages]] that Rome had already won in other powerful kingdoms like [[France]].
Since the legitimacy granted by the church was necessary both, especially Isabella, to stay in power, the creation of the Spanish Inquisition may have been a way to apparently concede to the Pope's demands and criticism regarding Spain's mixed religious heritage, while at the same time ensuring that the Pope could hardly force the second inquisition of his own, and at the same time create a tool to control the power of the Roman Church in Spain.
The Spanish Inquisition was unique at the time because it did not depend on the Pope in the slightest. Once the bull of creation was granted the head of the inquisition was the Monarch of Spain. It was in charge of enforcing the laws of the king regarding religion and other private-life matters, not of following orders from Rome, from which was independent. This independence allowed the Inquisition to investigate, prosecute and convict clergy for both corruptions ([[pedophilia]], forgery of documents..) and possible charges of treason of conspiracy against the crown (on the Pope's behalf presumably) without the Pope's intervention. The inquisition was, despite of its title of "Holy", not formed necessarily by clergy but secular lawyers were equally welcome to it. If it was an attempt at keeping Rome out of Spain, it was an extremely successful and refined one. It was a bureaucratic body which had the nominal authority of the church and permission to prosecute members of the church, which the kings couldn't do while responding only to the Spanish Crown. This did not prevent the Pope from having influence on the decisions of Spanish monarchs of course, but it forced the influence to be through the kings and made direct influence very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;El Rey Y El Papa: Política Y Diplomacia En Los Albores Del Renacimiento (Castilla En El Siglo Xv) Óscar González - Sílex - 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other hypotheses===
Other hypotheses that circulate regarding the Spanish Inquisition's creation include:
*'''Economic reasons''': Since one of the penalties that the inquisition could enforce on the convicts was the confiscation of their property, which became Crown property, it has been stated that the creation of the Inquisition was a way to finance the crown. There is no solid reason for this hypothesis to stand alone, nor for the Kings of Spain to need an institution to do this gradually instead of confiscating property through edicts, but it may be one of the reasons why the Inquisition stayed for so long. This hypothesis notices the tendency of the Inquisition to operate in large and wealthy cities and is favoured for those who consider that most of those prosecuted for practising Judaism and Islam in secret were actually innocent of it.&lt;ref name="Spain 1966"&gt;The Marranos of Spain. From the late XIVth to the early XVIth Century, 1966. Ithaca, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gustav Bergenroth]] editor and translator of the Spanish state papers 1485-1509 believed that revenue was the incentive for Ferdinand and Isabella's decision to invite the Inquisition into Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/spain/vol1/i-lxxiii Calendar of State Papers, Spain, Vol. 1, 1485-1509; intro.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors point out that both monarchs were very aware of the economic backlash they would suffer from such decrease in population.
*'''Intolerance and racism''': This argument is usually made regarding the expulsion of the Jews or the Moriscos,&lt;ref name="Spain 1966"/&gt; and since the Inquisition was so closely interconnected with those actions can be expanded to it. It varies between those who deny that Spain was really that different to the rest of Europe regarding tolerance and openmindedness, and those who argue that it used to be but gradually the antisemitic and racism atmosphere of medieval Europe rubbed onto it. It explains the creation of the Inquisition as the result of exactly the same forces than the creation of similar entities across Europe. This view may account for the similarities between the Spanish Inquisition and similar institutions but completely fails to account for its many unique characteristics, including its time of appearance and its duration through time, so even if accepted requires the addition of some of the other hypothesis to be complete.&lt;ref&gt;The Spanish Inquisition: a History
Joseph Pérez - Yale University Press - 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Purely religious reasons''': essentially this view suggests that the Catholic Monarchs created the Inquisition to prosecute heretics and sodomites "because the Bible says so". A common criticism that this view receives is that the Bible also condemns greed, hypocrisy, and adultery, but the Inquisition was not in charge of prosecuting any of those things. It also did not prosecute those who did not go to mass on Sunday or otherwise broke the Catholic rituals as far as it was out of simple laziness. Considering this double standard, its role was probably more complex and specific.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Activity of the Inquisition==

===Start of the Inquisition===
Fray Alonso de Ojeda, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar from Seville, convinced [[Queen Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of the existence of [[Crypto-Judaism]] among [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] ''[[conversos]]'' during her stay in [[Seville]] between 1477 and 1478.&lt;ref&gt;The terms ''converso'' and crypto-Jew are somewhat vexed, and occasionally historians are not clear on how, precisely, they are intended to be understood. For the purpose of clarity, in this article ''converso'' will be taken to mean one who has sincerely renounced Judaism or Islam and embraced Catholicism. Crypto-Jew will be taken to mean one who accepts Christian baptism, yet continues to practice Judaism.&lt;/ref&gt; A report, produced by [[Pedro González de Mendoza]], Archbishop of Seville, and by the Segovian Dominican [[Tomás de Torquemada]], corroborated this assertion.

Spanish monarchs [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] requested a [[papal bull]] establishing an inquisition in Spain in 1478 in response to the ''conversos'' returning to the practice of Judaism. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] granted a bull permitting the monarchs to select and appoint two or three priests over forty years of age to act as inquisitors.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=85}} In 1483, [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] established a state council to administer the inquisition with the Dominican Friar [[Tomás de Torquemada]] acting as its president, even though Sixtus IV protested the activities of the inquisition in [[Aragon]] and its treatment of the ''conversos''. Torquemada eventually assumed the title of Inquisitor-General.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=89}}

[[Thomas F. Madden]] describes the world that formed medieval politics: "The Inquisition was not born out of desire to crush diversity or oppress people; it was rather an attempt to stop unjust executions. Yes, you read that correctly. Heresy was a crime against the state. Roman law in the [[Code of Justinian]] made it a capital offense. Rulers, whose authority was believed to come from God, had no patience for heretics".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Madden: The Real Inquisition. National Review 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchs decided to introduce the Inquisition to [[Castile (Spain)|Castile]] to discover and punish crypto-Jews, and requested the pope's assent. [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] pressured Pope Sixtus IV to agree to an Inquisition controlled by the monarchy by threatening to withdraw military support at a time when the Turks were a threat to Rome. The pope issued a [[papal bull|bull]] to stop the Inquisition but was pressured into withdrawing it.  On 1 November 1478, Sixtus published the [[Papal bull]], ''Exigit Sinceras Devotionis Affectus'', through which he gave the monarchs exclusive authority to name the inquisitors in their kingdoms. The first two inquisitors, [[Miguel de Morillo]] and [[Juan de San Martín]], were not named, however, until two years later, on 27 September 1480 in [[Medina del Campo]].

The first ''[[auto-da-fé]]'' was held in Seville on 6 February 1481: six people were burned alive. From there, the Inquisition grew rapidly in the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. By 1492, tribunals existed in eight Castilian cities: [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]], [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], [[Medina del Campo]], [[Segovia]], [[Sigüenza]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], and [[Valladolid]]. Sixtus IV promulgated a new [[papal bull|bull]] categorically prohibiting the Inquisition's extension to [[Aragón]], affirming that:&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the book ''A History of the Jewish People'',&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, H.H., editor. 1976. p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | In 1482 the pope was still trying to maintain control over the Inquisition and to gain acceptance for his own attitude towards the [[New Christian]]s, which was generally more moderate than that of the Inquisition and the local rulers. | A History of the Jewish People}}

In 1483, Jews were expelled from all of [[Andalusia]]. Though the pope wanted to crack down on abuses, Ferdinand pressured him to promulgate a new bull, threatening that he would otherwise separate the Inquisition from Church authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Mathew|Archbishop Arnold H. Mathew]], ''The Life and Times of Rodrigo Borgia'', p. 52-53. Quote: "Isabella's Confessor, [[Tomás de Torquemada|Torquemada]], had imbued her with the idea that the suppression of all heresy within her realms was a sacred duty. She had, therefore, in November 1478, obtained a bull from the Pope, Sixtus IV., for the establishment of the Inquisition in Castile. Many modern writers have sought to reduce her share in the introduction of this terrible institution, but it must be remembered that Isabella herself probably considered it a meritorious action to punish with inhuman barbarity those whom she looked upon as the enemies of the Almighty. In 1480, two Dominicans were appointed by her, as Inquisitors, to set up their tribunal at Seville. Before the end of the year 1481, 2,000 victims were burned alive in Andalusia alone. The Pope himself became alarmed and threatened to withdraw the bull, but Ferdinand intimated that he would make the Inquisition altogether an independent tribunal. This it became later for all practical purposes, and its iniquitous proceedings continued unchecked."&lt;/ref&gt; Sixtus did so on 17 October 1483, naming [[Tomás de Torquemada]] Inquisidor General of Aragón, Valencia, and [[Catalonia]].

Torquemada quickly established procedures for the Inquisition. A new court would be announced with a thirty-day grace period for confessions and the gathering of accusations by neighbors. Evidence that was used to identify a crypto-Jew included the absence of chimney smoke on Saturdays (a sign the family might secretly be honoring the Sabbath) or the buying of many vegetables before Passover or the purchase of meat from a converted butcher. The court employed [[Forced confession|physical torture to extract confessions]]. Crypto-Jews were allowed to confess and do penance, although those who relapsed were burned at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, H.H., editor. A History of the Jewish People. Harvard University Press, 1976, pp. 588-590.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1484, Pope [[Innocent VIII]] attempted to allow appeals to Rome against the Inquisition, but Ferdinand in December 1484 and again in 1509 decreed death and confiscation for anyone trying to make use of such procedures without royal permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this, the Inquisition became the only institution that held authority across all the realms of the Spanish monarchy and, in all of them, a useful mechanism at the service of the crown. However, the cities of Aragón continued resisting, and even saw revolt, as in [[Teruel]] from 1484 to 1485. However, the murder of ''Inquisidor'' [[Pedro Arbués]] in [[Zaragoza]] on September 15, 1485, caused public opinion to turn against the ''conversos'' and in favour of the Inquisition. In Aragón, the Inquisitorial courts were focused specifically on members of the powerful ''converso'' minority, ending their influence in the Aragonese administration.

The Inquisition was extremely active between 1480 and 1530. Different sources give different estimates of the number of trials and executions in this period; some estimate about 2,000 executions, based on the documentation of the ''autos-da-fé'', the great majority being ''conversos'' of Jewish origin. He offers striking statistics: 91.6% of those judged in Valencia between 1484 and 1530 and 99.3% of those judged in Barcelona between 1484 and 1505 were of Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False conversions===

The Inquisition had jurisdiction only over Christians. It had no power to investigate, prosecute, or convict Jews, Muslims, or any open member of other religion. Anyone who was known to identify as either Jew or Muslim was outside of Inquisitorial jurisdiction and could only be tried by the King. All the inquisition could do in some of those cases was to deport the individual according to the King's law, but usually, even that had to go through a Civil Tribunal. The Inquisition only had power to try those who self-identified as Christians (initially for taxation purposes, later to avoid deportation well) while practicing another religion de facto. Even those were treated as Christians. If they confessed or identified not as "judeizantes" but as fully practicing Jews, they fell back into the previously explained category and could not be targeted (they would have pleaded guilty to lying about being Christians previously though).

====Expulsion of Jews. Jewish ''conversos''====
[[File:An auto-da-fé of the Spanish Inquisition and the execution o Wellcome V0041892.jpg|thumb|Though not subject to the Inquisition, Jews who refused to convert or leave Spain were called heretics and could be burned to death on a stake]]
The Spanish Inquisition had been established in part to prevent ''conversos'' from engaging in Jewish practices, which, as Christians, they were supposed to have given up. However this remedy for securing the orthodoxy of ''conversos'' was eventually deemed inadequate since the main justification the monarchy gave for [[Antisemitism in Spain|formally expelling all Jews from Spain]] was the "great harm suffered by Christians (i.e., ''conversos'') from the contact, intercourse and communication which they have with the Jews, who always attempt in various ways to seduce faithful Christians from our Holy Catholic Faith", according to the 1492 edict.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alhambra Decree]], issued in January 1492, gave the choice between expulsion and conversion. It was among the few expulsion orders that allowed conversion as an alternative and is used as a proof of the religious, not racial, element of the measure. The enforcement of this decree was very unequal however, with the focus mainly on coastal and southern regions-those at risk of Ottoman invasion- and a more gradual and ineffective enforcement towards the interior.&lt;ref name="Suárez Fernández 2012"/&gt;

Historic accounts of the numbers of Jews who left Spain were based on speculation, and some aspects were exaggerated by early accounts and historians: [[Juan de Mariana]] speaks of 800,000 people, and [[Don Isaac Abravanel]] of 300,000. While few reliable statistics exist for the expulsion, modern estimates based on tax returns and population estimates of communities are much lower, with Kamen stating that, of a population of approximately 80,000 Jews and 200,000 ''conversos'', about 40,000 emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews of the kingdom of Castile emigrated mainly to Portugal (where the entire community was forcibly converted in 1497) and to North Africa. The Jews of the kingdom of Aragon fled to other Christian areas including Italy, rather than to Muslim lands as is often assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the vast majority of ''conversos'' simply assimilated into the Catholic dominant culture, a minority continued to practice Judaism in secret, gradually migrated throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Ottoman Empire, mainly to areas where Sephardic communities were already present as a result of the Alhambra Decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Murphy | first = Cullen | title = God's jury : the Inquisition and the making of the modern world | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | location = Boston | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-0-618-09156-0 | page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most intense period of persecution of ''conversos'' lasted until 1530. From 1531 to 1560, however, the percentage of ''conversos'' among the Inquisition trials dropped to 3% of the total. There was a rebound of persecutions when a group of crypto-Jews was discovered in [[Quintanar de la Orden]] in 1588; and there was a rise in denunciations of ''conversos'' in the last decade of the sixteenth century. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, some ''conversos'' who had fled to Portugal began to return to Spain, fleeing the persecution of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], founded in 1536. This led to a rapid increase in the trials of crypto-Jews, among them a number of important financiers. In 1691, during a number of ''[[autos-da-fé]]'' in [[Majorca]], 37 ''chuetas'', or ''conversos'' of Majorca, were burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the eighteenth century the number of ''conversos'' accused by the Inquisition decreased significantly. [[Manuel Santiago Vivar]], tried in Córdoba in 1818, was the last person tried for being a crypto-Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expulsion of the Moriscos and Morisco ''conversos''====
The Inquisition searched for false or relapsed converts among the [[Moriscos]], who had converted from [[Islam]]. Beginning with a decree on February 14, 1502, Muslims in Granada had to choose between conversion to Christianity or expulsion.&lt;ref name="Prien2012" /&gt; In the Crown of Aragon, most Muslims had faced this choice after the [[Revolt of the Brotherhoods]] (1519–1523). It is important to note that the enforcement of the expulsion of the moriscos was enforced really unevenly, especially in the lands of the interior and the north, where the coexistence had lasted for over five centuries and moriscos were protected by the population, and orders were partially or completely ignored.

The [[Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1568–71)|War of the Alpujarras]] (1568–71), a general Muslim/Morisco uprising in Granada that expected to aid an Ottoman disembarcation in the peninsula, ended in a forced dispersal of about half of the region's Moriscos throughout Castile and Andalusia as well as increased suspicions by Spanish authorities against this community.

Many Moriscos were suspected of practising Islam in secret, and the jealousy with which they guarded the privacy of their domestic life prevented the verification of this suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;S.P. Scott: History, Vol II, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially they were not severely persecuted by the Inquisition, experiencing instead a policy of evangelization&lt;ref&gt;Absent records, the Inquisition decreed that all Moors were to be regarded as baptized and thus were Moriscos subject to the Inquisition.  Secular authorities then decreed (in 1526) that 40 years of religious instruction would precede any prosecution.  Fifty Moriscos were burnt at the stake before the Crown clarified its position.  Neither the Church nor the Moriscos utilized the years well. The Moriscos can be stereotyped as poor, rural, uneducated agricultural workers who spoke Arabic.  The Church had limited willingness or ability to educate this now-hostile group.{{harvp|Green|2007|pp=124-127}}&lt;/ref&gt; a policy not followed with those ''conversos'' who were suspected of being crypto-Jews. There were various reasons for this. In the kingdoms of Valencia and Aragon a large number of the Moriscos were under the jurisdiction of the nobility, and persecution would have been viewed as a frontal assault on the economic interests of this powerful social class. Most importantly, the moriscos had integrated in the Spanish society way better than the Jews, intermarrying with the population often, and were not seen as a foreign element, especially in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor J. Dadson, The Assimilation of Spain’s Moriscos:
Fiction or Reality? Journal of Levantine Studies, Vol. 1, No. 2, Winter 2011, pp. 11-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, fears ran high among the population that the Moriscos were traitorous, especially in Granada. The coast was regularly raided by [[Barbary pirate]]s backed by Spain's enemy, the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the Moriscos were suspected of aiding them.

In the second half of the century, late in the reign of Philip II, conditions worsened between [[Old Christians]] and Moriscos. The [[Morisco Revolt]] in Granada in 1568–1570 was harshly suppressed, and the Inquisition intensified its attention on the Moriscos. From 1570 Morisco cases became predominant in the tribunals of [[Zaragoza]], Valencia and Granada; in the tribunal of Granada, between 1560 and 1571, 82% of those accused were Moriscos, who were a vast majority of the Kingdom's population at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still the Moriscos did not experience the same harshness as judaizing ''conversos'' and Protestants, and the number of capital punishments was proportionally less.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1609, King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], upon the advice of his financial adviser the [[Duke of Lerma]] and Archbishop of Valencia [[Juan de Ribera]], decreed the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]]. Hundreds of thousands of Moriscos were expelled, some of them probably sincere Christians. This was further fueled by the religious intolerance of Archbishop Ribera who quoted the Old Testament texts ordering the enemies of God to be slain without mercy and setting forth the duties of kings to extirpate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lea|1901|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edict required: 'The [[Moriscos]] to depart, under the pain of death and confiscation, without trial or sentence... to take with them no money, bullion, jewels or bills of exchange.... just what they could carry.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lea|1901|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initial estimates of the number expelled such as those of Henri Lapeyre reach 300,000 Moriscos (or 4% of the total Spanish population), the extent and severity of the expulsion in much of Spain has been increasingly challenged by modern historians such as Trevor J. Dadson.&lt;ref name="bibliotecaspublicas.es"&gt;Trevor J. Dadson:  [http://www.bibliotecaspublicas.es/villarrubiadelosojos/imagenes/Dadson_Assimilation_Reality_or_Fiction.pdf ''The Assimilation of Spain's Moriscos: Fiction or Reality?'']. Journal of Levantine Studies, vol. 1, no. 2, Winter 2011, pp. 11-30&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the eastern region of Valencia, where ethnic tensions were high, was particularly affected by the expulsion, suffering economic collapse and depopulation of much of its territory.

Of those permanently expelled, the majority finally settled in the Maghreb or the Barbary coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boase|first=Roger|date=4 April 2002|title=The Muslim Expulsion from Spain|journal=[[History Today]]|volume=52|issue=4|quote=The majority of those permanently expelled settling in the [[Maghreb]] or [[Barbary Coast]], especially in Oran, Tunis, Tlemcen, Tetuán, Rabat and Salé.

The Inquisition pursued some trials against Moriscos who remained or returned after expulsion: at the height of the Inquisition, cases against Moriscos are estimated to have constituted less than 10 percent of those judged by the Inquisition. Upon the coronation of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] in 1621, the new king gave the order to desist from attempting to impose measures on remaining Moriscos and returnees. In September 1628 the Council of the Supreme Inquisition ordered inquisitors in Seville not to prosecute expelled Moriscos "unless they cause significant commotion." &lt;ref&gt;[http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/CHMO/article/view/37358/36158 Michel Boeglin: ''La expulsión de los moriscos de Andalucía y sus límites. El caso de Sevilla (1610-1613)''] (In Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; The last mass prosecution against Moriscos for crypto-Islamic practices occurred in Granada in 1727, with most of those convicted receiving relatively light sentences. By the end of the 18th century, the indigenous practice of Islam is considered to have been effectively extinguished in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4040221 ''Vínculos Historia'': ''The Moriscos who remained. The permanence of Islamic origin population in Early Modern Spain: Kingdom of Granada, XVII-XVIII centuries''] (In Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian Heretics===

The Spanish Inquisition had jurisdiction only over Christians. As such, those who self-identified as Christians could be investigated and trialed by it. Those in the group of "heretics" were all subject to investigation. All forms of heretic Christianity (Protestants, Orthodox, blaspheming Catholics, etc.) were considered under its jurisdiction.

==== Protestants and Anglicans====
[[File:Witch-scene4.JPG|thumb|The burning of a 16th-century Dutch [[Anabaptist]], Anneken Hendriks, who was charged with heresy]]
Despite popular myths about the Spanish Inquisition relating to Protestants, it dealt with very few cases involving actual Protestants, as there were so few in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that the [[Inquisition of the Netherlands]], is here not considered part of the Spanish Inquisition. Lutheran was a portmanteau accusation used by the Inquisition to act against all those who acted in a way that was offensive to the church. The first of the trials against those labeled by the Inquisition as "Lutheran" were those against the sect of [[mysticism|mystics]] known as the "[[Alumbrados]]" of [[Guadalajara (province)|Guadalajara]] and [[Valladolid]]. The trials were long and ended with prison sentences of differing lengths, though none of the sect were executed. Nevertheless, the subject of the "Alumbrados" put the Inquisition on the trail of many intellectuals and clerics who, interested in [[Erasmian]] ideas, had strayed from orthodoxy. This is striking because both Charles I and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] were confessed admirers of [[Erasmus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such{{clarify|being an intellectual or professing Erasmian ideas/and/or both?|date=June 2014}} was the case with the humanist [[Juan de Valdés]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was forced to flee to Italy to escape the process that had been begun against him, and the preacher, [[Juan de Ávila]], who spent close to a year in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first trials against [[Lutheran]] groups, as such, took place between 1558 and 1562, at the beginning of the reign of Philip II, against two communities of Protestants from the cities of Valladolid and Seville, numbering about 120.&lt;ref&gt;These trials, specifically those of Valladolid, form the basis of the plot of ''The Heretic: A novel of the Inquisition'' by Miguel Delibes (Overlook: 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The trials signaled a notable intensification of the Inquisition's activities. A number of ''[[auto-da-fé|autos-da-fé]]'' were held, some of them presided over by members of the royal family, and around 100 executions took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=99}} gives the figure of about 100 executions for heresy of any kind between 1559 and 1566. He compares these figures with those condemned to death in other European countries during the same period, concluding that in similar periods England, under [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], executed about twice as many for heresy: in France, three times the number, and ten times as many in the [[Low Countries]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''autos-da-fé'' of the mid-century virtually put an end to Spanish Protestantism, which was, throughout, a small phenomenon to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|pp=102-108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1562, though the trials continued, the repression was much reduced. About 200 Spaniards were accused of being Protestants in the last decades of the 16th century. &lt;blockquote&gt;Most of them were in no sense Protestants ... Irreligious sentiments, drunken mockery, anticlerical expressions, were all captiously classified by the inquisitors (or by those who denounced the cases) as "Lutheran." Disrespect to church images, and eating meat on forbidden days, were taken as signs of heresy...&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; It is estimated that a dozen Spaniards were burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to notice that Protestantism and Anglicanism were treated as a marker to identify agents of foreign powers and symptoms of political disloyalty as much, if not more, than as a cause of prosecution in itself. Religion, patriotism, obedience to the king and personal beliefs were not seen as separate aspects of life until the end of the Modern Age. Spain especially had a long tradition of using self-identified religion as a political and cultural marker, and expression of loyalty to a specific overlord, more than as an accurate description of personal beliefs -here the common accusation of heretics they received from Rome. In that note, accusations or prosecutions due to beliefs held by enemy countries must be seen as political accusations regarding political treason more than as religious ones. Other times the accusation of Protestantism was considered as an equivalent of blasphemy, just a general way of addressing insubordination.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez-Sala, Maria Luisa. Los PROTESTANTES Y LA INQUISICIÓN. UNAM. https://archivos.juridicas.unam.mx/www/bjv/libros/6/2905/6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthodox Christianity====
Even though the Inquisition had theoretical permission to investigate Orthodox "heretics", it almost never did. There was no major war between Spain and any Orthodox nation, so there was no reason to do so. There was one casualty tortured by those "Jesuits" (though most likely, [[Franciscans]]) who administered the Spanish Inquisition in North America, according to authorities within the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]],:  St. [[Peter the Aleut]]. Even that single report has various numbers of inaccuracies that make it problematic, and has no confirmation in the Inquisitorial archives.

===Witchcraft and Superstition===
The category "superstitions" includes trials related to [[witchcraft]]. The [[witch-hunt]] in Spain had much less intensity than in other European countries (particularly France, Scotland, and Germany). One remarkable case was [[Logroño witch trials|that of Logroño]], in which the witches of [[Zugarramurdi]] in [[Navarre]] were persecuted. During the ''[[auto-da-fé]]'' that took place in [[Logroño]] on November 7 and November 8, 1610, six people were burned and another five burned in [[effigy]].&lt;ref&gt;These trials are the theme of the film ''Akelarre'', by the Spanish director Pedro Olea.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the inquisition in cases of witchcraft was much more restricted than is commonly believed. Well after the foundation of the inquisition, jurisdiction over sorcery and witchcraft remained in secular hands.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kamen: The Spanish Inquisition A Historical Revision. 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In general the Inquisition maintained a skeptical attitude towards cases of witchcraft, considering it as a mere superstition without any basis. [[Alonso Salazar Frias|Alonso de Salazar Frías]], who took the Edict of Faith to various parts of Navarre after the trials of Logroño, noted in his report to the Suprema that, "There were neither [[witches]] nor [[bewitched]] in a village until they were talked and written about".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Henningsen, Gustav, ed. The Salazar Documents: Inquisitor Alonso de Salazar Frías and Others on the Basque Witch Persecution. Vol 21, Cultures, Beliefs, and Traditions: Medieval and Early Modern Peoples. Boston: Koninklijke Brill, 2004. Second Report of Salazar to the Inquisitor General (Logroño, 24 March 1612): An account of the whole visitation and publication of the Edict with special reference to the witches' sect, 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blasphemy====
Included under the rubric of ''heretical propositions'' were verbal offences, from outright [[blasphemy]] to questionable statements regarding religious beliefs, from issues of sexual morality to misbehaviour of the clergy. Many were brought to trial for affirming that ''simple fornication'' (sex between unmarried persons) was not a sin or for putting in doubt different aspects of [[Christian]] faith such as [[Transubstantiation]] or the virginity of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|pp=223-224}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, members of the clergy itself were occasionally accused of heretical propositions. These offences rarely led to severe penalties.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

====Sodomy====
The first sodomite was burned by the Inquisition in Valencia in 1572, and those accused included 19% clergy, 6% nobles, 37% workers, 19% servants, and 18% soldiers and sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all of almost 500 cases of sodomy between persons concerned the relationship [[pederasty|between an older man and an adolescent]], often by coercion, with only a few cases where the couple were consenting [[homosexual]] adults. About 100 of the total involved allegations of child abuse. Adolescents were generally punished more leniently than adults, but only when they were very young (under ca. 12 years) or when the case clearly concerned rape did they have a chance to avoid punishment altogether. As a rule, the Inquisition condemned to death only those sodomites over the age of 25 years. As about half of those tried were under this age, it explains the relatively small percentage of death sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Monter, ''Frontiers of Heresy'', pp. 276-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to notice that cases of sodomy did not receive the same treatment in all areas of Spain. In the Kingdom of Castile crimes of sodomy were not investigated by the Inquisition unless they were associated with religious heresy (In other words, the sodomy itself was investigated only as, and when, considered a symptom of a heretic belief or practice). In any other area cases were considered an issue of civil authorities, and even then was not very actively investigated. The Crown of Aragon was the only area in which they were considered under the Inquisitorial jurisdiction, probably due to the previous presence of the Pontifical Inquisition in that kingdom. Within the Crown of Aragon, the tribunal of the city of Zaragoza was famously harsh even at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Henry (2011). La Inquisición Española. Una revisión histórica. p. 192 pp259&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason to group "sodomy" with heresies and not with "marriage and family" is that sodomy was strongly associated with Islam, Judaism, Catharism, and heresy in general. It was seen as a symptom of them more than as a condition or peculiarity in itself.

====Freemasonry====
{{Further|Papal ban of Freemasonry|In eminenti apostolatus}}
The Catholic Church has regarded [[Freemasonry]] as heretical since about 1738; the ''suspicion'' of Freemasonry was potentially a capital offense. Spanish Inquisition records reveal two prosecutions in Spain and only a few more throughout the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, [[Francisco Javier de Mier y Campillo]], the [[Inquisitor General]] of the Spanish Inquisition and the [[Bishop of Almería]], suppressed Freemasonry and denounced the lodges as "societies which lead to atheism, to sedition and to all errors and crimes."&lt;ref name="Denslow"&gt;William R. Denslow, [[Harry S. Truman]]: ''10,000 Famous Freemasons'', {{ISBN|1-4179-7579-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He then instituted a purge during which [[Spaniards]] could be arrested on the charge of being "suspected of Freemasonry".&lt;ref name="Denslow" /&gt;

=== Censorship ===
[[File:Inquisition01.jpg|thumb|A 1508 woodcut of the Inquisition]]

As one manifestation of the [[Counter-Reformation]], the Spanish Inquisition worked actively to impede the diffusion of heretical ideas in Spain by producing "Indexes" of prohibited books. Such lists of prohibited books were common in Europe a decade before the Inquisition published its first. The first Index published in Spain in 1551 was, in reality, a reprinting of the Index published by the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] in 1550, with an appendix dedicated to Spanish texts. Subsequent Indexes were published in 1559, 1583, 1612, 1632, and 1640. The Indexes included an enormous number of books of all types, though special attention was dedicated to religious works, and, particularly, vernacular translations of the Bible.

Included in the Indices, at one point, were many of the great works of [[Spanish literature]]. Also, a number of religious writers who are today considered saints by the Catholic Church saw their works appear in the Indexes. At first, this might seem counter-intuitive or even nonsensical—how were these Spanish authors published in the first place if their texts were then prohibited by the Inquisition and placed in the Index? The answer lies in the process of publication and censorship in Early Modern Spain. Books in Early Modern Spain faced prepublication licensing and approval (which could include modification) by both secular and religious authorities. However, once approved and published, the circulating text also faced the possibility of post-hoc censorship by being denounced to the Inquisition—sometimes decades later. Likewise, as Catholic theology evolved, once-prohibited texts might be removed from the Index.

At first, inclusion in the Index meant total prohibition of a text; however, this proved not only impractical and unworkable, but also contrary to the goals of having a literate and well-educated clergy. Works with one line of suspect dogma would be prohibited in their entirety, despite the orthodoxy of the remainder of the text. In time, a compromise solution was adopted in which trusted Inquisition officials blotted out words, lines or whole passages of otherwise acceptable texts, thus allowing these expurgated editions to circulate. Although in theory the Indexes imposed enormous restrictions on the diffusion of culture in Spain, some historians argue that such strict control was impossible in practice and that there was much more liberty in this respect than is often believed. And Irving Leonard has conclusively demonstrated that, despite repeated royal prohibitions, romances of chivalry, such as ''[[Amadis de Gaula|Amadis of Gaul]]'', found their way to the New World with the blessing of the Inquisition. Moreover, with the coming of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century, increasing numbers of licenses to possess and read prohibited texts were granted.

[[File:Scene from an Inquisition by Goya.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Inquisition Scene'' by [[Francisco Goya]]. The Spanish Inquisition was still in force in the late eighteenth century, but much reduced in power.]]
Despite the repeated publication of the Indexes and a large bureaucracy of censors, the activities of the Inquisition did not impede the development of Spanish literature's "Siglo de Oro", although almost all of its major authors crossed paths with the Holy Office at one point or another. Among the Spanish authors included in the Index are [[Bartolomé Torres Naharro]], [[Juan del Enzina]], [[Jorge de Montemayor]], [[Juan de Valdés]] and [[Lope de Vega]], as well as the anonymous ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' and the ''[[Cancionero General]]'' by [[Hernando del Castillo]]. ''[[La Celestina]]'', which was not included in the Indexes of the [[16th century]], was expurgated in 1632 and prohibited in its entirety in 1790. Among the non-Spanish authors prohibited were [[Ovid]], [[Dante]], [[Rabelais]], [[Ariosto]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Erasmus]], [[Jean Bodin]], [[Valentin Naboth#cite note-13|Valentine Naibod]] and [[Thomas More]] (known in Spain as Tomás Moro). One of the most outstanding and best-known cases in which the Inquisition directly confronted literary activity is that of [[Fray Luis de León]], noted humanist and religious writer of converso origin, who was imprisoned for four years (from 1572 to 1576) for having translated the [[Song of Songs]] directly from Hebrew.

Some scholars state that one of the main effects of the inquisition was to end free thought and scientific thought in Spain. As one contemporary Spaniard in exile put it: "Our country is a land of ... [[barbarian|barbarism]]; down there one cannot produce any culture without being suspected of [[heresy]], error and [[Judaism]]. Thus silence was imposed on the learned."{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} For the next few centuries, while the rest of Europe was slowly awakened by the influence of the Enlightenment, Spain stagnated.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul, ''A History of Christianity'', [[Penguin Books|Penguin]], [[London]] 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this conclusion is contested.

The [[censorship]] of books was actually very ineffective, and prohibited books circulated in Spain without significant problems. The Spanish Inquisition never persecuted [[scientist]]s, and relatively few scientific books were placed on the Index. On the other hand, Spain was a state with more political freedom than in other absolute monarchies in the 16th to 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2005|pp=126–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent paradox gets explained by both the [[hermeticist]] religious ideas of the Spanish church and monarchy, and the budding seed of what would become [[Enlightened absolutism]] taking shape in Spain. The list of banned books was not, as interpreted sometimes, a list of evil books but a list of books that lay people were very likely to misinterpret. The presence of highly symbolical and high-quality literature in the list was so explained. These metaphorical or parable sounding books were listed as not meant for free circulation, but there might be no objections to the book itself and the circulation among scholars was mostly free. Most of this books were carefully collected by the elite. The practical totality of the prohibited books can be found now as then in the library of the [[monasterio del Escorial]], carefully collected by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]]. The collection was "public" after Philip II's death and members of universities, intellectuals, courtesans, clergy, and certain branches of the nobility didn't have too many problems to access them and commission authorised copies. The Inquisition has not been known to make any serious attempt to stop this for all the books, but there are some records of them "suggesting" the King of Spain to stop collecting grimoires or magic related ones.
This attitude was also not new. Translations of the Bible to Castillian and Provenzal (Catalan) had been made and allowed in Spain since the Middle Ages. The first preserved copy dates from the 13th century. However, like [[Polyglot Bible|the bible of Cisneros]] they were mostly for scholarly use, and it was customary for laymen to ask religious or academic authorities to review the translation and supervise the use.

===Family and Marriage===

====Bigamy====
The Inquisition also pursued offenses against morals and general social order, at times in open conflict with the jurisdictions of civil tribunals.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In particular, there were trials for [[bigamy]], a relatively frequent offence&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a society that only permitted divorce under the most extreme circumstances.  In the case of men, the penalty was two hundred lashes and five to ten years of "service to the Crown". Said service could be whatever the court deemed most beneficial for the nation but it usually was either five years as an oarsman in a royal [[galley]] for those without any qualification&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; (possibly a death sentence),&lt;ref&gt;Statistics are not available for Spanish oarsmen, but the general state of Mediterranean oared galleys circa 1570 was grim.  "... galley slaves led lives bitter and short."  "One way or another the oared galley consumed men like fuel.  Each dying wretch dumped overboard had to be replaced - and there were never enough."{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Roger |title=Empires of the sea : the siege of Malta, the battle of Lepanto, and the contest for the center of the world |publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks |location=New York |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8129-77646 |pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ten years working maintained but without salary in a public Hospital or charitable institution of the sort for those with some special skill, such as doctors, surgeons, or lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;Arrazola, Lorenzo. Enciclopedia Espanola De Derecho Y Administracion: Ciu-col .. Madrid: Saraswati Press, 2012 pp 572(Enciclopedia of Spanish Penal and Administrative Law)&lt;/ref&gt; The penalty was five to seven years as an oarsman in the case of Portugal.

====Unnatural Marriage====

Under the category of "unnatural marriage" fell any marriage or attempted marriage between two individuals who could not procreate. The Catholic Church in general, and in particular a nation constantly at war like Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Estudios Sobre Cultura, Guerra Y Polt̕ica En La Corona De Castilla (siglos Xiv-xvii) (Studies Over War Culture and Politics in the Kingdom of Castile) Fernando Cc̀eres - Editorial Csic Consejo Superior De Investigaciones Cientf̕icas - 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaler, Amy. Fertility, Gender and War: The "culture of Contraception". University of Minnesota, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasised the reproductive goal of marriage. The Spanish Inquisition's policy in this regard was restrictive but applied in a very egalitarian way. It considered unnatural any non-reproductive marriage, and natural any reproductive one, regardless of gender or sex involved. The two forms of obvious male sterility were either due to damage to the genitals through castration or accidental wounding at war (capón) or to some genetic condition that might keep the man from completing puberty (lampiño). Female sterility was also a reason to declare a marriage unnatural but was harder to prove. One of the most interesting cases to study the attitude of the Spanish Inquisition regarding marriage, sex, and gender is the trial of [[Eleno de Céspedes]].

===Non-religious Crimes===

Despite popular belief, the role of the Inquisition as a mainly religious institution, or religious in nature at all, is contested at best. Its main function was that of a private police for the Crown with jurisdiction to enforce the law in those crimes that took place in the private sphere of life. The notion of religion and civil law being separate is a modern construction and made no sense in the 15th century, so there was no difference between breaking a law regarding religion and breaking a law regarding tax collection. The difference between them is a modern projection the institution itself did not have.
As such, the Inquisition was the prosecutor (in some cases the only prosecutor) of any crimes that could be perpetrated without the public taking notice (mainly domestic crimes, crimes against the weakest members of society, administrative crimes and forgeries, organized crime, and crimes against the Crown).

Examples include crimes associated with sexual or family relations such as [[rape]] and [[sexual violence]] (the Inquisition was the first and only body who punished it across the nation), [[bestiality]], [[pedophilia]] (often overlapping with sodomy), [[incest]], [[child abuse]] or [[child neglect|neglect]] and (as discussed) [[bigamy]]. Non-religious crimes also included [[procurement]] (not [[prostitution]]), [[human trafficking]], [[smuggling]], forgery or falsification of [[counterfeit currency|currency]], [[document forgery|documents]] or [[signature forgery|signatures]], tax [[fraud]] (many religious crimes were considered subdivisions of this one), [[illegal weapons]], [[wikt:swindle|swindle]]s, disrespect to the Crown or its institutions (the Inquisition included, but also the church, the guard, and the kings themselves), [[espionage]] for a foreign power, [[conspiracy]], [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/3241610 Online access to the Historical Archives of the Inquisition in Valencia], where the records of the trials and correspondence to officials can be found; you can find the corresponding ones to various other areas in Spain in the same webpage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The non-religious crimes processed by the Inquisition accounted for a considerable percentage of its total investigations and are often hard to separate in the statistics, even when documentation is available. The line between religious and non-religious crimes did not exist in 15th century Spain as legal concept. Many of the crimes listed here and some of the religious crimes listed in previous sections were contemplated under the same article. For example, "sodomy" included paedophilia as a subtype. Often part of the data given for prosecution of male homosexuality corresponds to convictions for paedophilia, not adult homosexuality. In other cases, religious and non-religious crimes were seen as distinct but equivalent. The treatment of public blasphemy and street swindlers was similar (since in both cases you are "misleading the public in a harmful way). Making counterfeit currency and heretic proselytism was also treated similarly; both of them were punished by death and subdivided in similar ways since both were "spreading falsifications". In general heresy and falsifications of material documents were treated similarly by the Spanish Inquisition, indicating that they may have been thought of as equivalent actions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Another difficulty to discriminate the inquisition's secular and religious activity is the common association of certain types of investigations. An accusation or suspicion on certain crime often launched an automatic investigation on many others. Anyone accused of espionage due to non-religious reasons would likely be investigated for heresy too, and anyone suspected of a heresy associated to a foreign power would be investigated for espionage too automatically. Likewise, some religious crimes were considered likely to be associated with non-religious crimes, like human trafficking, procurement, and child abuse was expected to be associated to sodomy, or sodomy was expected to be associated to heresy and false conversions. Which accusation started the investigation isn't always clear.
Finally, trials were often further complicated by the attempts of witnesses or victims to add further charges, especially [[witchcraft]]. Like in the case of [[Eleno de Céspedes]], charges for witchcraft done in this way, or in general, were quickly dismissed but they often show in the statistics as investigations made.

== Organization ==
Beyond its role in religious affairs, the Inquisition was also an institution at the service of the monarchy. The Inquisitor General, in charge of the Holy Office, was designated by the crown. The Inquisitor General was the only public office whose authority stretched to all the kingdoms of Spain (including the American viceroyalties), except for a brief period (1507–1518) during which there were two Inquisitors General, one in the kingdom of Castile, and the other in [[Aragon]].

[[File:Auto de fe Lima.jpg|thumb|Auto-da-fé, [[Plaza Mayor, Lima|Plaza Mayor]] in [[Lima]], Viceroyalty of Peru, 17th century]]

The Inquisitor General presided over the Council of the Supreme and General Inquisition (generally abbreviated as "Council of the Suprema"), created in 1483, which was made up of six members named directly by the crown (the number of members of the Suprema varied over the course of the Inquisition's history, but it was never more than 10). Over time, the authority of the Suprema grew at the expense of the power of the Inquisitor General.

The Suprema met every morning, except for holidays, and for two hours in the afternoon on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The morning sessions were devoted to questions of faith, while the afternoons were reserved for "minor heresies"&lt;ref&gt;Henningsen, Gustav: The Spanish Inquisition and the Inquisitorial Mind, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; cases of perceived unacceptable sexual behavior, [[bigamy]], [[witchcraft]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the Suprema were the various tribunals of the Inquisition, which were originally itinerant, installing themselves where they were necessary to combat heresy, but later being established in fixed locations. During the first phase numerous tribunals were established, but the period after 1495 saw a marked tendency towards centralization.

In the kingdom of Castile, the following permanent tribunals of the Inquisition were established:
* 1482 In [[Seville]] and in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]].
* 1485 In [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and in [[Llerena, Badajoz|Llerena]].
* 1488 In [[Valladolid]] and in [[Murcia]].
* 1489 In [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]].
* 1505 In [[Las Palmas]] ([[Canary Islands]]).
* 1512 In [[Logroño]].
* 1526 In [[Granada]].
* 1574 In [[Santiago de Compostela]].

There were only four tribunals in the kingdom of [[Aragon]]: [[Zaragoza]] and [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] (1482), [[Barcelona]] (1484), and [[Majorca]] (1488).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand the Catholic]] also established the Spanish Inquisition in [[Sicily]] (1513), housed in [[Palermo]], and [[Sardinia]], in the town of [[Sassari]].&lt;ref&gt;In [[Sicily]], the Inquisition functioned until 30 March 1782, when it was abolished by King [[Ferdinand IV of Naples]]. It is estimated that 200 people were executed during this period.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Americas, tribunals were established in [[Lima]] and in [[Mexico City]] (1569) and, in 1610, in [[Cartagena de Indias]] (present day [[Colombia]]).

==Composition of the tribunals==
[[File:Estructura de la Inquisición.svg|thumb|Structure of the Spanish Inquisition]]

Initially, each of the tribunals included two inquisitors, a ''calificador'' (qualifiers), an ''alguacil'' (bailiff), and a ''fiscal'' (prosecutor); new positions were added as the institution matured. The inquisitors were preferably jurists more than theologians; in 1608 [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] even stipulated that all the inquisitors must have a background in law. The inquisitors did not typically remain in the position for a long time: for the Court of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], for example, the average tenure in the position was about two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the inquisitors belonged to the secular clergy (priests who were not members of [[religious orders]]) and had a university education.

The ''fiscal'' was in charge of presenting the accusation, investigating the denunciations and interrogating the witnesses by the use of physical and mental torture. The ''calificadores'' were generally theologians; it fell to them to determine if the defendant's conduct added up to a crime against the faith. Consultants were expert jurists who advised the court in questions of procedure. The court had, in addition, three secretaries: the ''notario de secuestros'' (Notary of Property), who registered the goods of the accused at the moment of his detention; the ''notario del secreto'' (Notary of the Secret), who recorded the testimony of the defendant and the witnesses; and the ''escribano general'' (General Notary), secretary of the court. The ''alguacil'' was the executive arm of the court, responsible for detaining, jailing, and physically torturing the defendant. Other civil employees were the ''nuncio'', ordered to spread official notices of the court, and the ''alcaide'', jailer in charge of feeding the prisoners.

In addition to the members of the court, two auxiliary figures existed that collaborated with the Holy Office: the ''familiares'' and the ''comissarios'' (commissioners). ''Familiares'' were lay collaborators of the Inquisition, who had to be permanently at the service of the Holy Office. To become a ''familiar'' was considered an honour, since it was a public recognition of ''[[limpieza de sangre]]'' — Old Christian status — and brought with it certain additional privileges. Although many nobles held the position, most of the ''familiares'' came from the ranks of commoners. The commissioners, on the other hand, were members of the religious orders who collaborated occasionally with the Holy Office.

One of the most striking aspects of the organization of the Inquisition was its form of financing: devoid of its own budget, the Inquisition depended exclusively on the confiscation of the goods of the denounced. It is not surprising, therefore, that many of those prosecuted were rich men. That the situation was open to abuse is evident, as stands out in the memorandum that a ''converso'' from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] directed to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Your Majesty must provide, before all else, that the expenses of the Holy Office do not come from the properties of the condemned, because if that is the case, if they do not burn they do not eat.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Accusation ===
When the Inquisition arrived in a city, the first step was the ''Edict of Grace''. Following the Sunday mass, the Inquisitor would proceed to read the edict; it explained possible heresies and encouraged all the congregation to come to the tribunals of the Inquisition to "relieve their consciences". They were called ''Edicts of Grace'' because all of the self-incriminated who presented themselves within a ''period of grace'' (usually ranging from thirty to forty days) were offered the possibility of reconciliation with the Church without severe punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of benevolence was effective, and many voluntarily presented themselves to the Inquisition and were often encouraged to denounce others who had also committed offenses, informants being the Inquisition's primary source of information. After about 1500, the Edicts of Grace were replaced by the ''Edicts of Faith'', which left out the grace period and instead encouraged the denunciation of those guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The denunciations were anonymous, and the defendants had no way of knowing the identities of their accusers.&lt;ref&gt;Though over the course of the trial, their identities likely became apparent.&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the points most criticized by those who opposed the Inquisition (for example, the [[Cortes of Castile]], in 1518). In practice, false denunciations were frequent. Denunciations were made for a variety of reasons, from genuine concern, to rivalries and personal jealousies.

=== Detention ===
[[File:Mateo Zapata.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Diego Mateo Zapata|Diego Mateo López Zapata]] in his cell before his trial by the Inquisition Court of Cuenca]]

After a denunciation, the case was examined by the ''calificadores'', who had to determine if there was heresy involved, followed by detention of the accused. In practice, however, many were detained in preventive custody, and many cases of lengthy incarcerations occurred, lasting up to two years, before the ''calificadores'' examined the case.&lt;ref&gt;"In the tribunal of [[Valladolid]], in 1699, various suspects (including a girl of 9 and a boy of 14) were jailed for up to two years with having had the least evaluation of the accusations presented against them" ({{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=180}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Detention of the accused entailed the preventive sequestration of their property by the Inquisition. The property of the prisoner was used to pay for procedural expenses and the accused's own maintenance and costs. Often the relatives of the defendant found themselves in outright misery. This situation was remedied only following instructions written in 1561.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Some authors, such as [[Thomas William Walsh]], stated that the entire process was undertaken with the utmost secrecy, as much for the public as for the accused, who were not informed about the accusations that were levied against them. Months or even years could pass without the accused being informed about why they were imprisoned. The prisoners remained isolated, and, during this time, the prisoners were not allowed to attend [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] nor receive the [[sacraments]]. The jails of the Inquisition were no worse than those of secular authorities, and there are even certain testimonies that occasionally they were much better.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Thomas William, ''Characters of the Inquisition'', P.J. Kennedy &amp; Sons, 1940, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; There are few records of the time of the accused in prison, but the transcription of the trials repeatedly shows the accused being informed of every charge during the trial. They also show the accused answers, in which they address each accusation specifically. Given that they would be informed anyway, it makes little sense for the accused to be kept in the dark prior to the trial, unless the investigation was still open.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mecd.gob.es/dam/jcr:7d0f0b12-1c0e-49f6-b437-23206a95086d/original-primera-parte.pdf preserved transcripts of a trial as sample&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mecd.gob.es/dam/jcr:a1b40405-5bbd-4a44-a031-41bb121702a3/transcripcion.pdf Printed version of previous source&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trial ===
The inquisitorial process consisted of a series of hearings, in which both the denouncers and the defendant gave testimony. A [[defense counsel]] was assigned to the defendant, a member of the tribunal itself, whose role was simply to advise the defendant and to encourage them to speak the truth. The prosecution was directed by the ''fiscal''. Interrogation of the defendant was done in the presence of the ''Notary of the Secreto'', who meticulously wrote down the words of the accused. The archives of the Inquisition, in comparison to those of other judicial systems of the era, are striking in the completeness of their documentation. 
In order to defend themselves, the accused had two possibilities: ''abonos'' (to find favourable witnesses, akin to "substantive" evidence/testimony in Anglo-American law) or ''tachas'' (to demonstrate that the witnesses of accusers were not trustworthy, akin to Anglo-American "impeachment" evidence/testimony).

The documentation from the notary usually show the following content, which gives us an idea of what the actual trial was likely to look like:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mecd.gob.es/dam/jcr:a1b40405-5bbd-4a44-a031-41bb121702a3/transcripcion.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

*A first page in which the notary wrote the date, the names and charges of the members of the tribunal, the name of the accused and the accuser, the accusation, and the names of everyone present in the room during the trial.
*A second page with the accused's first statement about their innocence or culpability, and their general response and recollection of the facts. This part usually takes from a thick fluid paragraph to a couple of pages and are relatively formal, within the accused's education level, from which one can suspect that the accused had time to prepare it prior to either the trial or the declaration, and probably help from the defendant. This paragraph also shows the accused addressing every charge from the first page, by points, which shows that the accused must have been informed of the charges against them.
*A third section with the ''fiscal'''s name and the transcription of a speech in which they address the accused's statement, also by points, and presents their case regarding each one separately.
*A fourth section, usually dated on the next day or a couple of days after the fiscal's intervention, with the name of the "procurador"( defendant) and the transcription of a speech in which they address the fiscal's arguments, again by points and separately, and defend the accused regarding each one. 
*A fifth section with the tribunal's response to this. In the vast majority of cases, the response is to order the search and calling of certain individuals, as witnesses, or of some experts such as doctors to testify and ratify some parts of what has been said, and giving a date for the tribunal to come together again and examine the evidence. Usually, the fiscal and procurator can ask for the presence of some witnesses here too, as it is inferred by them showing up later, but that is not always specifically stated in the transcripts and may be done outside of trial.
*The next section is often dated sometime later. Each witness or expert is introduced by complete name, job, relationship to the victim if any, and relationship to the case.  The witness's testimony is not transcribed word by word like in previous cases but summarized by the notary, probably because it was not prepared and does not follow a coherent, consistent order and writing implements were rather expensive to waste. 
* A page in which the procurador(defendant) declared the questions he is going to make to (usually another) group of witnesses of his choice since he often states that "he has asked them to come"or "he has called them". The answers given by each witness follow, with each witness presented as in the previous section. These testimonies are also paraphrased and summarized but addressed by points, with the answer to each question paraphrased separately.
*The fiscal and the procurador require equal copies of the testimony of the witnesses and keep them, demanding that no copy is shown to anyone until the end of a period of usually six days in which the witnesses have the chance to call the tribunal again to change their mind or add something.
*A third meeting of the tribunal with a new date. The transcription of a new speech by the procurator stating his view of the declarations and wrapping the witnesses' testimony up from his perspective. 
*A similar intervention, usually far shorter, from the fiscal.
*The response from the tribunal, paraphrased, which could be to dictate the sentence, but often was to require either further clarification from the witness (restarting the procedure from the second step) or call for another type of proof (restarting the procedure from the sixth step). These steps would repeat cyclically in the documentation of the trial, through different meetings of the tribunal and different weeks, until the tribunal has reached a conclusion.
*A literal transcription of the verdict and sentence. If the accused has been accused of more than one thing the sentence usually comes by points too. It is not uncommon for some of the accusations to be dismissed along with the process and said the process to continue taking into account the remaining ones. While sentences of innocence could be given at any point in a trial for multiple crimes, sentences of culpability only appear once the trial is over and all investigations opened against the accused are closed.

Regarding the fairness of the trials, the structure of them was similar to modern trials and extremely advanced for the time. However, the  Inquisition was dependent on the political power of the King. The lack of separation of powers allows assuming questionable fairness for certain scenarios. The fairness of the Inquisitorial tribunals seemed to be among the best in early modern Europe when it came to the trial of laymen.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Madden. "The Truth about the Spanish Inquisition." Crisis (october de 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"LA INQUISICIÓN ESPAÑOLA".José Martínez MillánAlianza Editorial Bolsillo(2010)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also testimonies by former prisoners that, if believed, suggest that said fairness was less than ideal when national or political interests were involved.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Henry (2011). La Inquisición Española. Una revisión histórica. pp. 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to obtain a confession or information relevant to an investigation, the Inquisition made use of [[torture]], but not in a systematic way. It could only be applied when all other options, witnesses and experts had been used, the accused was found guilty or most likely guilty, and relevant information regarding accomplices or specific details were missing. It was applied mainly against those suspected of [[Judeization]] and [[Protestantism]] beginning in the 16th century, in other words "enemies of the state", since said crimes were usually thought to be associated with a larger organized network of either espionage or conspiracy with foreign powers. For example, Lea estimates that between 1575 and 1610 the court of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] tortured approximately a third of those processed for Protestant heresy.&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Lea, III, p. 33, Cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=185}}. {{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=43}} finds the same statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; The recently opened Vatican Archives suggest even lower numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Madden. "The Truth about the Spanish Inquisition." Crisis (October de 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Messori, Vittorio (2000). Leyendas Negras de la Iglesia. Editorial Planeta (this source is a Catholic apologist)&lt;/ref&gt;  In other periods, the proportions varied remarkably. Torture was always a means to obtain the confession of the accused, not a punishment itself.

=== Torture ===
[[File:Picard.jpg|thumb|Inquisition [[torture chamber]]. ''Mémoires Historiques'' (1716)]]

Torture was employed in all civil and religious trials in Europe. The Spanish Inquisition was no exception. Its main differentiation characteristic was that, as opposed to both civil trials and other inquisitions, it had very strict regulations regarding when, what, to whom, how many times, for how long and under what supervision it could be applied.&lt;ref name="Bethencourt, Francisco 1997"&gt;Bethencourt, Francisco. La Inquisición En La Época Moderna: España, Portugal E Italia, Siglos Xv-xix. Madrid: Akal, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haliczer_79"&gt;Haliczer, Stephen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=crCQmS_85EEC&amp;dq Inquisition and society in the kingdom of Valencia, 1478-1834], p. 79, University of California Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamenop"&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish inquisition engaged in it far less often and with greater care than other courts.&lt;ref name="Haliczer_79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters, Edward pp. 92-93"&gt;by Peters, Edward, ''Inquisition'', Dissent, Heterodoxy and the Medieval Inquisitional Office, pp. 92-93, University of California Press (1989), {{ISBN|0-520-06630-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the civil court, both Spanish and otherwise, there was no restriction regarding duration or any other point.

*'''When''': Torture was allowed only: ''"when sufficient proofs to confirm the culpability of the accused have been gathered by other means, and every other method of negotiation have been tried and exhausted''". It was stated by the inquisitorial rule that information obtained through torment was not reliable, and confession should only be extracted this way when all needed information was already known and proven. Confessions obtained through torture could not be used to convict or sentence anyone.
*'''What''': The Spanish Inquisition was prohibited to "''maim, mutilate, draw blood or cause any sort of permanent damage''" to the prisoner. Breaking bones was of course not allowed.&lt;ref name="Kamenop" /&gt; There was a closed list of the allowed torture methods. These were all tried and used in the civil courts all through Europe, and therefore known to be "safe" in this regard. Any other method, regardless of whether it was legal in the country or practiced in civil courts, was not allowed.
*'''Who''': Neither the elderly, the young, the sick or injured, or pregnant women could be subjected to torture. Torture of females was prohibited in all but the most extreme crimes and could not be performed by males.
*'''How many times''': Each accusation allowed for a different number of torment sessions on the same person (once the "when" condition of the culpability being supported by the strong external evidence was fulfilled). The number was dependent on how "harmful to society" the crime was. Counterfeit currency allowed for a maximum of two. The most serious offenses allowed for a maximum of eight.
*'''For how long''': "Torment" could be applied for a maximum of 15 minutes. The Roman Inquisition allowed for 30 minutes.
*'''Supervision''': The presence of a doctor was required at all times to ensure that no serious harm could result and to intervene in case of unexpected complications. It was also required for a doctor to certify that the prisoner was healthy enough to go through the torment without suffering harm.&lt;ref&gt;Crespo Vargas, Pablo L. La Inquisición Española Y Las Supersticiones En El Caribe Hispano. Madrid: Palibrio, 2011. pp120-130&lt;/ref&gt;

Per contrast, European civil trials from England to Italy and from Spain to Russia could use, and did use, torture without justification and for as long as they considered. So much so that there were serious tensions between the Inquisition and Philip III, since the Inquisitors complained that "those people sent to the prisons of the King blasphemed and accused themselves of heresy just to be sent under the Inquisitorial jurisdiction instead of the King's" and that was collapsing the Inquisition's tribunals. During the reign of Philip IV there were registered complaints of the Inquisitors about people who "Blasphemated, mostly in winter, just to be detained and fed inside the prison".  
Despite some popular accounts, modern historians state that torture was only ever used to confirm information or a confession, not for punitive reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The inside of a jail of the Spanish Inquisition, with a prie Wellcome V0041650.jpg|thumb|left|The inside of a jail of the Spanish Inquisition, with a priest supervising his scribe while men and women are suspended from pulleys, tortured on the rack or burnt with torches. Etching.]]

Rafael Sabatinni states that among the methods of [[torture]] allowed, and common in other secular and ecclesiastical tribunals, were ''garrucha'', ''toca'' and the ''potro''.,&lt;ref name="Kamenop" /&gt; even though those claims contradict both the Inquisitorial law and the claims made by Kamen. The application of the ''garrucha'', also known as the [[strappado]], consisted of suspending the victim from the ceiling by the wrists, which are tied behind the back. Sometimes weights were tied to the ankles, with a series of lifts and drops, during which the arms and legs suffered violent pulls and were sometimes dislocated.&lt;ref&gt;Sabatini, Rafael, ''Torquemada and the Spanish Inquisition: A History'', p. 190, Kessinger Publishing (2003), {{ISBN|0-7661-3161-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The use of te ''toca''(cloth), also called ''interrogatorio mejorado del agua'' (improved [[waterboarding]]/improved water interrogation), is better documented. It consisted of introducing a cloth into the mouth of the victim, and forcing them to [[waterboarding|ingest water]] spilled from a jar so that they had the impression of drowning.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, George Ryley, ''The History of Torture Throughout the Ages'', p. 172, Columbia University Press (2003) {{ISBN|0-7103-0837-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''potro'', the [[rack (torture)|rack]], in which the limbs were slowly pulled apart, was thought to be the instrument of torture used most frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Carrol. James, ''Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews: A History'', p. 356, Houghton Mifflin Books (2002), {{ISBN|0-618-21908-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them all, the "submarino/ [[waterboarding]]" was by far the most commonly used, since it was cheap, and seen as "harmless and very safe" (safer for the victim than clothless waterboarding, hence the "improved" (''mejorado'') epithet).

The assertion that ''confessionem esse veram, non factam vi tormentorum'' (literally: '[a person's] confession is truth, not made by way of torture') sometimes follows a description of how, after torture had ended, the subject freely confessed to the offenses.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Edward, ''Inquisition'', Dissent, Heterodoxy and the Medieval Inquisitional Office, p. 65, University of California Press (1989), {{ISBN|0-520-06630-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus confessions following torture were deemed to be made of the confessor's free will, and hence valid.

Once the process concluded, the inquisidores met with a representative of the bishop and with the ''consultores'' (consultants), experts in [[theology]] or [[Canon Law]] (but not necessarily clergy themselves), which was called the ''consulta de fe'' (faith consultation/religion check). The case was voted and sentence pronounced, which had to be unanimous. In case of discrepancies, the ''Suprema'' had to be informed.

=== Sentencing ===
The results of the trial could be the following:
# Although quite rare in actual practice, the defendant could be '''acquitted'''. Inquisitors did not wish to terminate the proceedings. If they did, and new evidence turned up later, they would be forced into reopening and re-presenting the old evidence.
# The trial could be '''suspended''', in which case the defendant, although under suspicion, went free (with the threat that the process could be continued at any time) or was held in long-term imprisonment until a trial commenced. When set free after a suspended trial it was considered a form of acquittal without specifying that the accusation had been erroneous.
# The defendant could be '''penanced'''. Since they were considered guilty, they had to publicly abjure their crimes (''de levi'' if it was a misdemeanor, and ''de vehementi'' if the crime were serious), and accept a public punishment. Among these were ''[[sanbenito]]'', exile, fines or even sentencing to service as oarsmen in royal [[galley]]s.
# The defendant could be '''reconciled'''. In addition to the public ceremony in which the condemned was reconciled with the Catholic Church, more severe punishments were used, among them long sentences to jail or the galleys, plus the confiscation of all property. Physical punishments, such as whipping, were also used.
# The most serious punishment was '''relaxation''' to the [[secular arm]]. The Inquisition had no power to actually kill the convict or determine the way in which they should die; that was a right of the King. [[Burning at the stake]] was a possibility, probably kept from the Papal Inquisition of Aragon, but a very uncommon one. This penalty was frequently applied to impenitent heretics and those who had relapsed. Execution was public. If the condemned repented, they were shown mercy by being [[garrote]]d before their corpse was burned; if not, they were burned alive.

Frequently, cases were judged ''in absentia'', and when the accused died before the trial finished, the condemned were burned in effigy.

The distribution of the punishments varied considerably over time. It is believed that sentences of death were enforced in the first stages within the long history of the Inquisition. According to García Cárcel, the court of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], one of the most active, employed the death penalty in 40% of the convicts{{clarify|date=April 2018}}&lt;!---It isn't very clear if it means 40% / 3% of all the convicts, of all the trialed, or if 40% of crimes were punished this way.---&gt; before 1530, but later that percentage dropped to 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Auto-da-fé'' ===
{{main|Auto-da-fé}}
[[File:Francisco rizi-auto de fe.jpg|thumb|Auto-da-fé, [[Plaza Mayor, Madrid|Plaza Mayor]] in Madrid, 1683]]

If the sentence was [[wikt:condemnatory|condemnatory]], this implied that the condemned had to participate in the ceremony of an ''auto de fe'' (more commonly known in English as an ''auto-da-fé'') that solemnized their return to the Church (in most cases), or punishment as an impenitent heretic. The ''autos-da-fé'' could be private (''auto particular'') or public (''auto publico'' or ''auto general'').

Although initially the public ''autos'' did not have any special solemnity nor sought a large attendance of spectators, with time they became solemn ceremonies, celebrated with large public crowds, amidst a festive atmosphere. The ''auto-da-fé'' eventually became a [[baroque]] spectacle, with staging meticulously calculated to cause the greatest effect among the spectators. The ''autos'' were conducted in a large public space (frequently in the largest plaza of the city), generally on holidays. The rituals related to the ''auto'' began the previous night (the "procession of the Green Cross") and sometimes lasted the whole day. The ''auto-da-fé'' frequently was taken to the canvas by painters: one of the better-known examples is the painting by [[Francesco Rizzi]] held by the [[Prado]] Museum in [[Madrid]] that represents the ''auto'' celebrated in the Plaza Mayor of Madrid on 30 June 1680. The last public ''auto-da-fé'' took place in 1691.

The ''auto-da-fé'' involved a Catholic Mass, prayer, a public procession of those found guilty, and a reading of their sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Peters 1988: 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; They took place in public squares or esplanades and lasted several hours; ecclesiastical and civil authorities attended. Artistic representations of the ''auto-da-fé'' usually depict torture and the burning at the stake. However, this type of activity never took place during an ''auto-da-fé'', which was in essence a religious act. Torture was not administered after a trial concluded, and executions were always held after and separate from the ''auto-da-fé'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=192–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in the minds and experiences of observers and those undergoing the confession and execution, the separation of the two might be experienced as merely a technicality.

[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumb|upright|Execution of [[Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal|Mariana de Carabajal]] (converted Jew), Mexico City, 1601]]

The first recorded ''auto-da-fé'' was held in Paris in 1242, during the reign of Louis IX.&lt;ref&gt;Stavans 2005:xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Spanish ''auto-da-fé'' did not take place until 1481 in Seville; six of the men and women subjected to this first religious ritual were later executed. The Inquisition had limited power in Portugal, having been established in 1536 and officially lasting until 1821, although its influence was much weakened with the government of the Marquis of Pombal in the second half of the 18th century. ''Autos-da-fé'' also took place in Mexico, Brazil and Peru: contemporary historians of the Conquistadors such as Bernal Díaz del Castillo record them. They also took place in the Portuguese colony of Goa, India, following the establishment of Inquisition there in 1562–1563.

The arrival of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Spain slowed inquisitorial activity. In the first half of the 18th century, 111 were condemned to be burned in person, and 117 in effigy, most of them for [[Judaizers|judaizing]]. In the reign of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], there were 125 ''autos-da-fé'', while in the reigns of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] and [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] only 44.

During the 18th century, the Inquisition changed: Enlightenment ideas were the closest threat that had to be fought. The main figures of the Spanish Enlightenment were in favour of the abolition of the Inquisition, and many were processed by the Holy Office, among them [[Pablo de Olavide|Olavide]], in 1776; [[Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa|Iriarte]], in 1779; and [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos|Jovellanos]], in 1796; Jovellanos sent a report to Charles IV in which he indicated the inefficiency of the Inquisition's courts and the ignorance of those who operated them: "friars who take [the position] only to obtain gossip and exemption from choir; who are ignorant of foreign languages, who only know a little [[scholastic theology]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Elorza, ''La Inquisición y el pensamiento ilustrado.'' Historia 16. Especial 10º Aniversario ''La Inquisición''; p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its new role, the Inquisition tried to accentuate its function of censoring publications but found that Charles III had secularized [[censorship]] procedures, and, on many occasions, the authorization of the [[Council of Castile]] hit the more intransigent position of the Inquisition. Since the Inquisition itself was an arm of the state, being within the Council of Castile, civil rather than ecclesiastical censorship usually prevailed. This loss of influence can also be explained because the foreign Enlightenment texts entered the peninsula through prominent members of the nobility or government,&lt;ref&gt;Members of the government and the Council of Castile, as well as other members close to the court, obtained special authorization for books purchased in France, the Low Countries or Germany to cross the border without inspection by members of the Holy Office. This practice grew beginning with the reign of Charles III.&lt;/ref&gt; influential people with whom it was very difficult to interfere. Thus, for example, [[Diderot's Encyclopedia]] entered Spain thanks to special licenses granted by the king.

After the [[French Revolution]], however, the Council of Castile, fearing that revolutionary ideas would penetrate Spain's borders, decided to reactivate the Holy Office that was directly charged with the persecution of French works. An Inquisition edict of December 1789, that received the full approval of Charles IV and [[José Moñino y Redondo, conde de Floridablanca|Floridablanca]], stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;having news that several books have been scattered and promoted in these kingdoms... that, without being contented with the simple narration events of a seditious nature... seem to form a theoretical and practical code of independence from the legitimate powers.... destroying in this way the political and social order... the reading of thirty and nine French works is prohibited, under fine...&lt;ref&gt;Elorza, ''La Inquisición y el pensamiento ilustrado.'' p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, inquisitorial activity was impossible in the face of the information avalanche that crossed the border; in 1792, "the multitude of seditious papers... does not allow formalizing the files against those who introduce them".

The fight from within against the Inquisition was almost always clandestine. The first texts that questioned the Inquisition and praised the ideas of [[Voltaire]] or [[Montesquieu]] appeared in 1759. After the suspension of pre-publication censorship on the part of the Council of Castile in 1785, the newspaper ''[[El Censor]]'' began the publication of protests against the activities of the Holy Office by means of a rationalist critique. [[Valentin de Foronda]] published ''[[Espíritu de los Mejores Diarios]]'', a plea in favour of freedom of expression that was avidly read in the salons. Also, in the same vein, [[Manuel de Aguirre]] wrote On Toleration in ''El Censor'', ''[[El Correo de los Ciegos]]'' and ''[[El Diario de Madrid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The argument presented in the periodicals and other works circulating in Spain were virtually exact copies of the reflections of Montesquieu or Rousseau, translated into Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the Inquisition==
[[File:Penitenciado por la Inquisición.jpg|thumb|The [[Peruvian Inquisition]], based in Lima, ended in 1820.]]

During the reign of [[Charles IV of Spain]] (1788–1808), in spite of the fears that the [[French Revolution]] provoked, several events accelerated the decline of the Inquisition. The state stopped being a mere social organizer and began to worry about the well-being of the public. As a result, the land-holding power of the Church was reconsidered, in the ''[[señorío]]s'' and more generally in the accumulated wealth that had prevented social progress.&lt;ref&gt;Church properties, in general, and those of the Holy Office in particular, occupied large tracts of today's [[Castile and León]], [[Extremadura]] and [[Andalucia]]. The properties were given under feudal terms to farmers or to localities who used them as community property with many restrictions, owing a part of the rent, generally in cash, to the church.&lt;/ref&gt; The power of the throne increased, under which [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers found better protection for their ideas. [[Manuel Godoy]] and [[Antonio Alcalá Galiano]] were openly hostile to an institution whose only role had been reduced to [[censorship]] and was the very embodiment of the Spanish [[Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition|Black Legend]], internationally, and was not suitable to the political interests of the moment:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Inquisition? Its old power no longer exists: the horrible authority that this bloodthirsty court had exerted in other times was reduced... the Holy Office had come to be a species of commission for book censorship, nothing more...&lt;ref&gt;Elorza, ''La Inquisición y el Pensamiento Ilustrado''. Historia 16. Especial 10º Aniversario ''La Inquisición''; pg. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Inquisition was first abolished during the domination of [[Napoleon]] and the reign of [[Joseph Bonaparte]] (1808–1812). In 1813, the liberal deputies of the [[Cortes of Cádiz]] also obtained its abolition,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Antonio Puigblanch]], ''La Inquisición sin máscara'', Cádiz, 1811–1813.&lt;/ref&gt; largely as a result of the Holy Office's condemnation of the popular revolt against French invasion. But the Inquisition was reconstituted when [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] recovered the throne on 1 July 1814. [[Juan Antonio Llorente]], who had been the Inquisition's general secretary in 1789, became a [[Afrancesado|Bonapartist]] and published a critical history in 1817 from his French exile, based on his privileged access to its archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly as a result of Llorente's criticisms, the Inquisition was once again temporarily abolished during the three-year Liberal interlude known as the [[Trienio liberal]], but still the old system had not yet had its last gasp. Later, during the period known as the [[Ominous Decade]], the Inquisition was not formally re-established,&lt;ref&gt;Historians have different interpretations. One argument is that during the Ominous Decade, the Inquisition was re-established- because of a statement made by [[King Alphonso]] upon a visit to the Vatican that he would reintroduce it if the occasion arose, but the Royal Decree that would have abolished the order of the Trienio Liberal was never approved, or at least, never published. The formal abolition under the regency of Maria Cristina was thus nothing more than a ratification of the abolition of 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; although, ''de facto'', it returned under the so-called Congregation of the Meetings of Faith, tolerated in the dioceses by King Ferdinand.  On 26 July 1826 the "Meetings of Faith" Congregation condemned and executed the school teacher [[Cayetano Ripoll]], who thus became the last person known to be executed by the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|pp=372-373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On that day, Ripoll was hanged in [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], for having taught [[deist]] principles.  This execution occurred against the backdrop of a European-wide scandal concerning the despotic attitudes still prevailing in Spain.  Finally, on 15 July 1834, the Spanish Inquisition was definitively abolished by a Royal Decree signed by regent [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies]], Ferdinand VII's liberal widow, during the minority of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and with the approval of the President of the Cabinet [[Francisco Martínez de la Rosa]]. (It is possible that something similar to the Inquisition acted during the 1833–1839 [[First Carlist War]], in the zones dominated by the Carlists, since one of the government measures praised by [[Conde de Molina Carlos Maria Isidro de Borbon]] was the re-implementation of the Inquisition to protect the Church). During the Carlist Wars it was the conservatives who fought the liberals who wanted to reduce the Church's power, amongst other reforms to liberalize the economy. It can be added that [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] is alleged to have stated that he would attempt to reintroduce it, possibly as a sop to Vatican approval of his coup.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The [[Alhambra Decree]] that had expelled the Jews was formally rescinded on 16 December 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1968/12/17/archives/1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-by-spain-1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-in.html 1492 Ban on Jews Is Voided by Spain]– ''The New York Times'', 17 December 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==

===Confiscations===
It is unknown exactly how much wealth was confiscated from converted Jews and others tried by the Inquisition. Wealth confiscated in one year of persecution in the small town of Guadaloupe paid the costs of building a royal residence.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the Spanish Inquisition. Greenwood Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-313-31667-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous records of the opinion of ordinary Spaniards of the time that "the Inquisition was devised simply to rob people". "They were burnt only for the money they had", a resident of Cuenca averred. "They burn only the well-off", said another. In 1504 an accused stated, "only the rich were burnt". In 1484 Catalina de Zamora was accused of asserting that "this Inquisition that the fathers are carrying out is as much for taking property from the conversos as for defending the faith. It is the goods that are the heretics." This saying passed into common usage in Spain. In 1524 a treasurer informed Charles V that his predecessor had received ten million ducats from the conversos, but the figure is unverified. In 1592 an inquisitor admitted that most of the fifty women he arrested were rich. In 1676, the Suprema claimed it had confiscated over 700,000 ducats for the royal treasury (which was paid money only after the Inquisition's own budget, amounting in one known case to only 5%). The property on Mallorca alone in 1678 was worth "well over 2,500,000 ducats".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death tolls and sentenced===
[[File:Contemporary illustration of the Auto-da-fe held at Validolid Spain 21-05-1559..jpg|thumb|Contemporary illustration of the auto-da-fé of [[Valladolid]], in which fourteen Protestants were burned at the stake for their faith, on May 21, 1559]]
García Cárcel estimates that the total number prosecuted by the Inquisition throughout its history was approximately 150,000; applying the percentages of executions that appeared in the trials of 1560–1700—about 2%—the approximate total would be about 3,000 put to death. Nevertheless, some authors consider that the toll may have been higher, keeping in mind the data provided by Dedieu and García Cárcel for the tribunals of Toledo and Valencia, respectively, and estimate between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed.&lt;ref name="Levack, Brian P. 1995"&gt;Data for executions for witchcraft: Levack, Brian P. (1995). The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe (Second Edition). London and New York: Longman, and see [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]] for more detail.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors disagree and estimate a max death toll between 1% and 5%, (depending on the time span used) combining all the processes the inquisition carried, both religious and non-religious ones.&lt;ref name="Bethencourt, Francisco 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eire, Carlos M.

New Haven: Yale University Press, 2016 pp 640&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, this is significantly lower than the [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe#Numbers of executions|number]] of people executed exclusively [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|for witchcraft in other parts of Europe]] during about the same time span as the Spanish Inquisition (estimated at c. 40,000–60,000).&lt;ref name="Levack, Brian P. 1995"/&gt; Other authors disagree with that statement though

Modern historians have begun to study the documentary records of the Inquisition. The archives of the Suprema, today held by the [[National Historical Archive (Spain)|National Historical Archive of Spain]] (Archivo Histórico Nacional), conserves the annual relations of all processes between 1540 and 1700. This material provides information for approximately 44,674 judgments. These 44,674 cases include 826 executions ''in persona'' and 778 ''in effigie'' (i.e. an effigy was burned). This material, however, is far from being complete—for example, the tribunal of Cuenca is entirely omitted, because no ''relaciones de causas'' from this tribunal have been found, and significant gaps concern some other tribunals (e.g., Valladolid). Many more cases not reported to the Suprema are known from the other sources (i.e., no ''relaciones de causas'' from Cuenca have been found, but its original records have been preserved), but were not included in Contreras-Henningsen's statistics for the methodological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;For full account see: Gustav Henningsen, ''The Database of the Spanish Inquisition. The relaciones de causas project revisited'', in: Heinz Mohnhaupt, Dieter Simon, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A_Sdchs7yAkC&amp;hl=pl Vorträge zur Justizforschung]'', Vittorio Klostermann, 1992, pp. 43-85.&lt;/ref&gt; William Monter estimates 1000 executions between 1530 and 1630 and 250 between 1630 and 1730.&lt;ref&gt;W. Monter, ''Frontiers of Heresy: The Spanish Inquisition from the Basque Lands to Sicily'', Cambridge 2003, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The secret archives of the Vatican regarding the Investigation have recently been disclosed, and are currently being revised. So far they support the lowest estimates given by historians for deaths and prosecution.

The archives of the Suprema only provide information about the processes which took place prior to 1560. To study the processes themselves, it is necessary to examine the archives of the local tribunals; however, the majority have been lost to the devastation of war, the ravages of time or other events. Some archives have survived including those of Toledo, where 12,000 were judged for offences related to heresy, mainly minor "blasphemy",  and those of Valencia.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Dedieu, ''Los Cuatro Tiempos'', in Bartolomé Benassar, ''Inquisición Española: poder político y control social'', pp. 15-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; These indicate that the Inquisition was most active in the period between 1480 and 1530, and that during this period the percentage condemned to death was much more significant than in the years that followed. Modern estimates show approximately 2,000 executions ''in persona'' in the whole of Spain up to 1530.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2005|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The actual numbers====
The actual numbers, as far as they can be reconstructed from the available sources, are following:

{| class="wikitable"
! Tribunal
! Estimated number of all trials in the period 1540–1700&lt;ref&gt;Henningsen, ''The Database of the Spanish Inquisition'', p. 84. Numbers in the table are given in approximation.&lt;/ref&gt;
! The number of executions ''in persona'' in the period 1540–1700&lt;ref&gt;Data for the Aragonese Secretariat are probably complete, some small lacunae may concern only Valencia and possibly Sardinia and Cartagena, but the numbers for Castilian Secretariat - except Canaries and Galicia - should be considered as minimal due to gaps in the documentation. In some cases it is remarked that the number does not concern the whole period 1540–1700.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse of power===
Author [[Toby Green]] notes that the great unchecked power given to inquisitors meant that they were "widely seen as above the law"&lt;ref name="Green-2007-4"/&gt; and sometimes had motives for imprisoning and sometimes executing alleged offenders other than for the purpose of punishing religious nonconformity, mainly in Hispanoamerica and Iberoamerica.&lt;ref name="Green-2007-4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Toby|title=Inquisition : the Reign of Fear|date=2007|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53724-1|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archivo General de las Indias, Seville, Santa Fe 228, Expediente 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Green-2007-4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archivo General de las Indias, Seville, Santa Fe 228, Expediente 81A, n.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Green quotes a complaint by historian Manuel Barrios&lt;ref name="Green-2007-65"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Toby|title=Inquisition : the Reign of Fear|date=2007|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53724-1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; about one Inquisitor, [[Diego Rodriguez Lucero]], who in Cordoba in 1506 burned to death the husbands of two different women he then kept as mistresses. According to Barrios, &lt;blockquote&gt;the daughter of Diego Celemin was exceptionally beautiful, her parents and her husband did not want to give her to [Lucero], and so Lucero had the three of them burnt and now has a child by her, and he has kept for a long time in the [[Alcázar of Seville|alcazar]] as a mistress.&lt;ref name="Barrios-1991-58"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrios|first1=Manuel|title=El Tribunal de la Inquisicion en Andalucia: Seleccion de Textos y Documentos|date=1991|publisher=J.

Defenders of the Inquisition discrediting with Green are many and seem to be the growing trend in current scholarship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; These authors don't necessarily deny the abuses of power but classify them as politically instigated and comparable to those of any other law enforcement body of the period. Criticisms, usually indirect, have gone from the suspiciously sexual overtones or similarities of these accounts with unrelated older antisemitic accounts of kidnap and torture,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; to the clear proofs of control that the king had over the institution, to the sources used by Green,&lt;ref&gt;Contreras, Jaime y Gustav Henningsen (1986). “Forty-four thousand cases of the Spanish Inquisition (1540-1700): analysis of a historical data bank”, en Henningsen G., J. A. Tedeschi et al. (comps.), The Inquisition in early modern Europe: studies on sources and methods. Dekalb: Northern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or just by reaching completely different conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, Joseph (2006). The Spanish Inquisition: a history. New Haven, CT : Yale University Press; p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juan Antonio Llorente: Historia crítica de la Inquisición en España (tomo IV, p. 183). Madrid: Hiperión, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the context of Hispano America, that Green refers to often, was different from the Iberian context studied for many of those authors, due to the distance from the immediate executive power of the King, and deserves to be examined separately. Among those who do, there are also discrediting voices regarding the nature and extent of the Inquisition's abuses.&lt;ref&gt;''Las luchas por la memoria en América Latina.

==Historiography==
&lt;!--NOTE: This intro paragraph is a high-level summary of the content below. Please add specific new information to the main sub-sections below.--&gt;
How historians and commentators have viewed the Spanish Inquisition has changed over time and continues to be a source of controversy. Before and during the 19th century historical interest focused on who was being persecuted. In the early and mid 20th century, historians examined the specifics of what happened and how it influenced Spanish history. In the later 20th and 21st century, historians have re-examined how severe the Inquisition really was, calling into question some of the assumptions made earlier periods.

===19th to early 20th century scholarship===
Before the rise of professional historians in the 19th century, the Spanish Inquisition had largely been portrayed by Protestant scholars who saw it as the archetypal symbol of Catholic intolerance and ecclesiastical power.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; The Spanish Inquisition for them was largely associated with the persecution of Protestants, or inexplicably, of witches.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; [[William H. Prescott]] described the Inquisition as an "eye that never slumbered".  Despite of the existence of extensive documentation regarding the trials and procedures, and to the Inquisition's deep bureaucratization, none of these sources were studied outside of Spain, and Spanish scholars arguing against the predominant view were automatically dismissed. The 19th-century professional historians, including the Spanish scholar [[José Amador de los Ríos|Amador de los Ríos]], were the first to successfully challenge this perception in the international sphere and get foreign scholars to make eco of their discoveries. Said scholars would obtain international recognition and start a period of revision on the [[Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition]].&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt;

At the start of the 20th century [[Henry Charles Lea]] published the groundbreaking ''History of the Inquisition in Spain''. This influential work describes the Spanish Inquisition as "an engine of immense power, constantly applied for the furtherance of obscurantism, the repression of thought, the exclusion of foreign ideas and the obstruction of progress."&lt;ref name=kagan&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/19/reviews/980419.19kagent.html "A Kinder, Gentler Inquisition"], by [[Richard Kagan]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'', 19 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Lea documented the Inquisition's methods and modes of operation in no uncertain terms, calling it "theocratic absolutism" at its worst.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; In the context of the polarization between Protestants and Catholics during the second half of the 19th century,&lt;ref name=leabio/&gt; some of Lea's contemporaries, as well as most modern scholars thought Lea's work had an [[anti-Catholic]] bias.&lt;ref name=leabio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/mss/lea/leabio.html/ |title=Henry Charles Lea Papers - Biographical Sketch |website=Univ. of Penn.-Penn Special Collections |accessdate=2007-04-18 |date=January 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/1112-96/article3.html |title=A New Industry: The Inquisition |website=Catholic.net |accessdate=2007-04-18 |date=12 November 1996|last=Van Hove |first=Brian |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070405150258/http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/1112-96/article3.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1920s, Jewish scholars picked up where Lea's work left off.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; They published [[Yitzhak Baer]]'s ''History of the Jews in Christian Spain'', [[Cecil Roth]]'s ''History of the Marranos'' and, after World War II, the work of [[Haim Beinart]], who for the first time published trial transcripts of cases involving conversos.

Contemporary historians who subscribe to the idea that the image of the Inquisition in historiography has been systematically deformed by the Black Legend include [[Edward Peters (scholar)|Edward Peters]], [[Philip Wayne Powell]], [[William S.Maltby]],  [[Richard Kagan]], [[Margaret R.

=== Revision after 1960 ===
{{Main|Historical revision of the Inquisition}}
The works of [[Julian Juderias|Juderias]] in (1913) and other Spanish scholars prior to him was mostly ignored by international scholarship until 1960.

One of the first books to build on them and internationally challenge the classical view was ''The Spanish Inquisition'' (1965) by [[Henry Kamen]]. Kamen argued that the Inquisition was not nearly as cruel or as powerful as commonly believed. The book was very influential and largely responsible for subsequent studies in the 1970s to try to quantify (from archival records) the Inquisition's activities from 1480 to 1834.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Jean-Pierre Dedieu, Los Cuatro Tiempos, in Bartolomé Benassar, Inquisición Española: poder político y control social, pp. 15-39 and {{harvp|García Cárcel|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those studies showed there was an initial burst of activity against conversos suspected of relapsing into Judaism, and a mid-16th century pursuit of Protestants, but the Inquisition served principally as a forum Spaniards occasionally used to humiliate and punish people they did not like: blasphemers, bigamists, foreigners and, in Aragon, homosexuals and horse smugglers.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; Kamen went on to publish two more books in 1985 and 2006 that incorporated new findings, further supporting the view that the Inquisition was not as bad as once described by Lea and others. Along similar lines is [[Edward Peters (scholar)|Edward Peters]]'s ''Inquisition'' (1988).

One of the most important works about the inquisition´s relation to the Jewish conversos or New Christians is ''The Origins of the Inquisition in Fifteenth Century Spain'' (1995/2002) by [[Benzion Netanyahu]]. It challenges the view that most conversos were actually practicing Judaism in secret and were persecuted for their crypto-Judaism. Rather, according to Netanyahu, the persecution was fundamentally racial, and was a matter of envy of their success in Spanish society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/news-and-politics/38335/personal-history/ Benzion Netanyahu’s History]&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been challenged multiple times, and with some reasonable divergences the majority of historians either align with religious causes or with merely cultural ones, with no significant racial element.&lt;ref&gt;Vicente Ángel Álvarez Palenzuela. ''Judíos y conversos en la España medieval. Estado de la cuestión'' (Jews and converts in medieval Spain. Estate of the matter). Universidad Autónoma de Madrid) eHumanista/Converso 4 (2015):156-191 [http://www.ehumanista.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.span.d7_eh/files/sitefiles/conversos/volume3/11%20ehumcon4.palenzuela.pdf It can be checked for free here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenging some of the claims of revisionist historians is [[Toby Green]] in ''Inquisition, the Reign of Fear'', who calls the claim by revisionists that torture was only rarely applied by inquisitors, a "worrying error of fact".&lt;ref name="Green-2007-10"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Toby|title=Inquisition : the Reign of Fear|date=2007|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53724-1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Thomas F. Madden]] has written about popular myths of the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/article/211193/real-inquisition-thomas-f-madden ''The Real Inquisition: investigating the popular myth''] by [[Thomas F. Madden]] ([[National Review]], 18 June 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

===Literature===
[[File:Francisco de Goya - Escena de Inquisición - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[The Inquisition Tribunal]] as illustrated by [[Francisco de Goya]]]]

The literature of the 18th century approaches the theme of the Inquisition from a critical point of view. In ''[[Candide]]'' by [[Voltaire]], the Inquisition appears as the epitome of intolerance and arbitrary justice in Europe.

During the [[Romanticism|Romantic Period]], the [[Gothic novel]], which was primarily a genre developed in Protestant countries, frequently associated Catholicism with terror and repression. This vision of the Spanish Inquisition appears in, among other works, ''[[The Monk]]'' (1796) by [[Matthew Gregory Lewis]] (set in Madrid during the Inquisition, but can be seen as commenting on the [[French Revolution]] and [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]]); ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'' (1820) by [[Charles Robert Maturin]] and ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'' by [[Poland|Polish]] author [[Jan Potocki]].

Literature of the 19th century tends to focus on the element of torture employed by the Inquisition. In France, in the early 19th century, the [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Cornelia Bororquia, or the Victim of the Inquisition]]'', which has been attributed to Spaniard [[Luiz Gutiérrez]], and is based on the case of [[María de Bohórquez]], ferociously criticizes the Inquisition and its representatives. The Inquisition also appears in one of the chapters of the novel ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (1880) by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], which imagines an encounter between [[Jesus]] and the Inquisitor General. One of the best known stories of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]", explores along the same lines the use of torture by the Inquisition. [[File:Ф.Гойя. Из цикла Los Caprichos 1797-98.jpg|thumb|upright|''There was no remedy'', from ''[[Caprichos|Los Caprichos]]'', 1797–98, by Francisco de Goya.]] The novel [[Cornelia Bororquia]] was published in France, probably by a French writer under the false name of Luis Gutiérrez. The Inquisition, as portrayed by the Black legend, has a prominent role in ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]].

The Inquisition also appears in 20th-century literature. ''La Gesta del Marrano'', by the Argentine author [[Marcos Aguinis]], portrays the length of the Inquisition's arm to reach people in Argentina during the 16th and 17th centuries. The first book in [[Les Daniels]]' "Don Sebastian Vampire Chronicles", ''The Black Castle'' (1978), is set in 15th-century Spain and includes both descriptions of Inquisitorial questioning and an [[auto-da-fé]], as well as [[Tomás de Torquemada]] appearing in one chapter. The [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' shows the Inquisition targeting [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Mutants]] for "blasphemy". The character [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] also appears as the [[Grand Inquisitor]]. The [[Captain Alatriste]] novels by the Spanish writer [[Arturo Pérez-Reverte]] are set in the early 17th century. The second novel, ''Purity of Blood'', has the narrator being tortured by the Inquisition and describes an [[auto-da-fé]]. [[Carme Riera]]'s novella, published in 1994, ''[[Dins el Darrer Blau]]'' (''In the Last Blue'') is set during the repression of the ''chuetas'' (''conversos'' from [[Majorca]]) at the end of the 17th century. In 1998, the Spanish writer [[Miguel Delibes]] published the historical novel ''The Heretic'', about the Protestants of [[Valladolid]] and their repression by the Inquisition. [[Samuel Shellabarger]]'s ''[[Captain from Castile]]'' deals directly with the Spanish Inquisition during the first part of the novel.

In the novel [[Cathedral of the Sea|La Catedral del Mar]]  by [[Ildefonso Falcones]], published in 2006 and set in the 14th century, there are scenes of inquisition investigations in small towns and a great scene in Barcelona.

===Film===
* The 1947 epic ''[[Captain from Castile]]'' by [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], starring [[Tyrone Power]], uses the Inquisition as the major plot point of the film. It tells how powerful families used its evils to ruin their rivals. The first part of the film shows this and the reach of the Inquisition reoccurs throughout this movie following [[Pedro De Vargas]] (played by Power) even to the 'New World'.
* The [[The History of the World Part 1#The Spanish Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition segment]] of the 1981 [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[The History of the World Part 1]]'' is a comedic musical performance based on the activities of the first [[Inquisitor General]] of Spain, [[Tomás de Torquemada]].
* The film ''[[The Fountain]]'' (2006), by [[Darren Aronofsky]], features the Spanish Inquisition as part of a plot in 1500 when the Grand Inquisitor threatens Queen Isabella's life.
* ''[[Goya's Ghosts]]'' (2006) by [[Miloš Forman]] is set in Spain between 1792 and 1809 and focuses realistically on the role of the Inquisition and its end under Napoleon's rule.
* The film ''[[Assassin's Creed (film)|Assassin's Creed]]'' (2016) by [[Justin Kurzel]], starring [[Michael Fassbender]], is set in both modern times and Spain during the Inquisition. The film follows Callum Lynch (played by Fassbender) as he is forced to relive the memories of his ancestor, Aguilar de Nehra (also played by Fassbender), an Assassin during the Spanish Inquisition.
* ''[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]'' ([[Roger Corman]], 1961).
*''[[Akelarre]]'' (Pedro Olea, 1984), a film, about the [[Logroño]] trial of the [[Zugarramurdi witches]].
*[[Tomás de Torquemada]] is portrayed in ''[[1492: The Conquest of Paradise]]'' (1992)

===Theatre, music, television, and video games===

* The Grand Inquisitor of Spain plays a part in ''[[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]'' (1867), a play by [[Friedrich Schiller]] (which was the basis for the opera ''[[Don Carlos]]'' in five acts by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], in which the Inquisitor is also featured, and the third act is dedicated to an ''auto-da-fé'').
* In the ''[[Monty Python]]'' comedy team's [[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|Spanish Inquisition sketches]], an inept Inquisitor group repeatedly bursts into scenes after someone utters the words "I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition", screaming "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!" The Inquisition then uses ineffectual forms of [[torture]], including a dish-drying [[Rack (torture)|rack]], soft cushions and a comfy chair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf_Y4MbUCLY 'Spanish Inquisition' Compilation - Monty Python's Flying Circus]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Spanish Inquisition features as a main plot line element of the 2009 video game ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''.
*The video game ''[[Nicolas Eymerich]]'' features a cruel, bloodthirsty and torture hungry Inquisitor as the main character.
* The Universe of ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' borrows several elements and concepts of the Catholic church Imaginarium, including the notion of the Black Legend's ideal of a fanatic Inquisitors, for some of its troops in ''[[Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor – Martyr]]''.
*The 1965 musical [[Man of La Mancha]] depicts a fictionalized account of author [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' run-in with Spanish authorities. The character of Cervantes produces a play-within-a-play of his unfinished manuscript, [[Don Quixote]], while he awaits sentencing by the Inquisition.

===Contemporary politics===

The Spanish Inquisition is a recurring trope that makes an occasional appearance in the British parliament, similar to calling something "nazi" to reject ideas seen as religiously authoritarian.&lt;ref&gt;Cobbett's Parliamentary History of England: From the Norman, Volumen 35&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sunwoo Hwi''' was a modern [[South Korea]]n author and novelist.&lt;ref&gt;”Sunwoo Hwi" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Sunwoo Hwi was born on January 3, 1922 in [[Chongju]], [[North Pyongan Province|Pyeonganbuk-do]], Korea (in what is now [[North Korea]]).&lt;ref name="Lee1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Who's Who in Korean Literature|chapter=Song Hui|pages=475–477|author=Lee, Kyung-ho|publisher=Hollym|location=Seoul|year=1996|isbn=1-56591-066-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer poet, journalist, soldier and philosopher he also fought in the [[Korean War]] from 1950 to 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121219184455/http://people.aks.ac.kr/front/tabCon/ppl/pplView.aks?pplId=PPL_7KOR_A1921_1_0005588&amp;category=dirSer Sunwoo Hwe:Korean historical person information] {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; poet, journalist, soldier and philosopher. He was a famous realist and anticommunist writer and journalist.  Hwi graduated from Gyeongseong Teachers School in 1944. He worked as a reporter for Chosun Ilbo before enlisting in the army in 1949 as an information and education officer. He made his literary debut in 1955 with the publication of his story "Ghost" (Gwisin).&lt;ref&gt;"Sunwoo Hwi" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The Korea Literature Translation Institute summarized Hwi's work:

:Behavioral humanism, or the expression of an active will in dire situations, characterizes Sunwoo Hwi’s literary world. “Flowers of Fire” (Bulkkot), for which he first gained recognition, features a man who overcomes his escapist mentality to embrace the spirit of resistance. As revealed in “Flowers of Fire” as well as in the novels Flagman Without a Flag (Gitbal eomneun gisu) and The Finale of the Chase (Chujeogui pinalle), the will to act is rooted in respect for mankind and desire to oppose dehumanization. For Sunwoo Hwi, the responsibility of intellectuals includes active participation in the affairs of the society and resistance to dehumanization caused by ideological conflicts and social ills. The humanistic approach, however, is overemphasized in works such as Myth of Bush-clover Village (Ssaritgorui sinhwa), giving the work the feel of an imaginary world removed from contemporary reality. After 1965, Sunwoo Hwi began to evince a more conservative attitude towards the establishment. “Golgotha Without Cross” (Sipjaga eomneun golgoda), “A Thirteen-Year-Old Boy” (Yeol sesarui sonyeon) and “A Funny Story About Funny People” focus on nostalgia for lost childhood homes, and The Jackpot (Nodaji), serialized in Chosun Weekly from 1979 to 1981, is a family chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;Source-attribution|"Sunwoo Hwi" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainable architecture''' is [[architecture]] that seeks to minimize the negative environmental impact of buildings by efficiency and moderation in the use of materials, energy, and development space and the ecosystem at large. Sustainable architecture uses a conscious approach to energy and ecological conservation in the design of the built environment.&lt;ref&gt;"Sustainable Architecture and Simulation Modelling", Dublin Institute of Technology, [http://www.cebe.heacademy.ac.uk/learning/habitat/HABITAT4/beattie.html#_Toc397853444] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506035740/http://www.cebe.heacademy.ac.uk/learning/habitat/HABITAT4/beattie.html |date=2013-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of sustainability, or [[ecological design]], is to ensure that our actions and decisions today do not inhibit the opportunities of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Doerr Architecture, Definition of Sustainability and the Impacts of Buildings [http://www.doerr.org/services/sustainability.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable energy use==
{{Main|Low-energy house|Zero-energy building}}
[[File:K2 apartments windsor.jpg|thumb|K2 sustainable apartments in [[Windsor, Victoria]], Australia by DesignInc (2006) features [[passive solar building design|passive solar design]], recycled and sustainable materials, [[photovoltaic cells]], [[wastewater]] treatment, [[Rainwater harvesting|rainwater collection]] and [[solar hot water]].]]

Shown is the town's new art center, which integrates its own solar panels and wind generators for energy self-sufficiency.]]

[[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]] over the entire life cycle of a building is the most important goal of sustainable architecture. [[Architect]]s use many different passive and active techniques to reduce the energy needs of buildings and increase their ability to capture or generate their own energy.&lt;ref name ="DeKayBrown"&gt;M. DeKay &amp; G.Z. Brown, Sun Wind &amp; Light, architectural design strategies, 3rd ed. ''Wiley'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; One of the keys to exploit local environmental resources and influence energy-related factors such as daylight, solar heat gains and ventilation is the use of [[site analysis]].

===Heating, ventilation and cooling system efficiency===
Numerous passive architectural strategies have been developed over time. Examples of such strategies include the arrangement of rooms or the sizing and orientation of windows in a building,&lt;ref name ="DeKayBrown" /&gt; and the orientation of facades and streets or the ratio between building heights and street widths for urban planning.&lt;ref name ="Montavon"&gt;M. Montavon, Optimization of Urban Form by the Evaluation of the Solar Potential, ''EPFL'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An important and [[Cost-effectiveness|cost-effective]] element of an efficient [[HVAC|heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC)]] system is a [[Building insulation|well-insulated building]]. A more efficient building requires less heat generating or dissipating power, but may require more ventilation capacity to expel [[indoor air quality|polluted indoor air]].

Significant amounts of energy are flushed out of buildings in the water, air and [[compost]] streams. [[Commercial off-the-shelf|Off the shelf]], on-site energy recycling technologies can effectively recapture [[Waste-to-energy|energy from waste]] hot water and stale air and transfer that energy into incoming fresh cold water or fresh air. Recapture of energy for uses other than gardening from compost leaving buildings requires centralized [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digesters]].

HVAC systems are powered by motors. [[Copper]], versus other metal conductors, helps to improve the electrical energy efficiencies of motors, thereby enhancing the sustainability of electrical building components. 

Site and building orientation have some major effects on a building's HVAC efficiency.

[[Passive solar building design]] allows buildings to harness the energy of the sun efficiently without the use of any [[active solar]] mechanisms such as [[photovoltaic cell]]s or [[solar hot water|solar hot water panels]]. Typically [[passive solar]] building designs incorporate materials with high [[thermal mass]] that retain heat effectively and strong [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] that works to prevent heat escape. Low energy designs also requires the use of solar shading, by means of awnings, blinds or shutters, to relieve the solar heat gain in summer and to reduce the need for artificial cooling.  In addition, [[low energy building]]s typically have a very low surface area to volume ratio to minimize heat loss. This means that sprawling multi-winged building designs (often thought to look more "organic") are often avoided in favor of more centralized structures. Traditional cold climate buildings such as [[United States|American]] [[American colonial architecture|colonial]] [[saltbox]] designs provide a good historical model for centralized heat efficiency in a small-scale building.

Windows are placed to maximize the input of heat-creating light while minimizing the loss of heat through glass, a poor insulator. In the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]] this usually involves installing a large number of south-facing windows to collect direct sun and severely restricting the number of north-facing windows. Certain window types, such as double or triple glazed [[insulated glazing|insulated windows]] with gas filled spaces and [[Low-emissivity|low emissivity (low-E)]] coatings, provide much better insulation than single-pane glass windows. Preventing excess solar gain by means of solar shading devices in the summer months is important to reduce cooling needs.  [[Deciduous trees]] are often planted in front of windows to block excessive sun in summer with their leaves but allow light through in winter when their leaves fall off.  Louvers or light shelves are installed to allow the sunlight in during the winter (when the sun is lower in the sky) and keep it out in the summer (when the sun is high in the sky).  [[Coniferous]] or [[Evergreen|evergreen plants]] are often planted to the north of buildings to shield against cold north winds.

In colder climates, heating systems are a primary focus for sustainable architecture because they are typically one of the largest single energy drains in buildings.

In warmer climates where cooling is a primary concern, passive solar designs can also be very effective. Masonry [[building material]]s with [[high thermal mass]] are very valuable for retaining the cool temperatures of night throughout the day. In addition builders often opt for sprawling single story structures in order to maximize surface area and heat loss.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Buildings are often designed to capture and channel existing winds, particularly the especially cool winds coming from nearby [[Body of water|bodies of water]]. Many of these valuable strategies are employed in some way by the [[Vernacular architecture|traditional architecture]] of warm regions, such as south-western mission buildings.

In climates with four seasons, an integrated energy system will increase in efficiency: when the building is well insulated, when it is sited to work with the forces of nature, when heat is recaptured (to be used immediately or stored), when the heat plant relying on [[fossil fuel]]s or electricity is greater than 100% efficient, and when [[renewable energy]] is used.

===Renewable energy generation===

====Solar panels====
{{Main|Solar PV}}
[[Active solar]] devices such as [[photovoltaic]] [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s help to provide sustainable electricity for any use. Electrical output of a solar panel is dependent on orientation, efficiency, latitude, and climate—solar gain varies even at the same latitude. Typical efficiencies for commercially available PV panels range from 4% to 28%. The low efficiency of certain photovoltaic panels can significantly affect the payback period of their installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=shamilton |url=http://www.solarbuzz.com/Moduleprices.htm |title=Module Pricing |publisher=Solarbuzz |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This low efficiency does not mean that solar panels are not a viable energy alternative. In Germany for example, Solar Panels are commonly installed in residential home construction.

Roofs are often angled toward the sun to allow photovoltaic panels to collect at maximum efficiency. In the northern hemisphere, a true-south facing orientation maximizes yield for solar panels. If true-south is not possible, solar panels can produce adequate energy if aligned within 30° of south. However, at higher latitudes, winter energy yield will be significantly reduced for non-south orientation.

To maximize efficiency in winter, the collector can be angled above horizontal Latitude +15°. To maximize efficiency in summer, the angle should be Latitude -15°. However, for an annual maximum production, the angle of the panel above horizontal should be equal to its latitude.&lt;ref&gt;G.Z. Brown, Mark DeKay. Sun, Wind &amp; Light. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wind turbines====
{{Main|Wind power}}
The use of undersized wind turbines in energy production in sustainable structures requires the consideration of many factors. In considering costs, small wind systems are generally more expensive than larger wind turbines relative to the amount of energy they produce. For small wind turbines, maintenance costs can be a deciding factor at sites with marginal wind-harnessing capabilities. At low-wind sites, maintenance can consume much of a small wind turbine's revenue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Brower, Michael; ''Cool Energy, The Renewable Solution to Global Warming''; Union of Concerned Scientists, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Wind turbines begin operating when winds reach 8&amp;nbsp;mph, achieve energy production capacity at speeds of 32-37&amp;nbsp;mph, and shut off to avoid damage at speeds exceeding 55&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The energy potential of a wind turbine is proportional to the square of the length of its blades and to the cube of the speed at which its blades spin. Though wind turbines are available that can supplement power for a single building, because of these factors, the efficiency of the wind turbine depends much upon the wind conditions at the building site. For these reasons, for wind turbines to be at all efficient, they must be installed at locations that are known to receive a constant amount of wind (with average wind speeds of more than 15&amp;nbsp;mph), rather than locations that receive wind sporadically.&lt;ref&gt;Gipe, Paul; ''Wind Power: Renewable Energy for Farm and Business''; Chelsea Green Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; A small wind turbine can be installed on a roof. Installation issues then include the strength of the roof, vibration, and the turbulence caused by the roof ledge. Small-scale rooftop wind turbines have been known to be able to generate power from 10% to up to 25% of the electricity required of a regular domestic household dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article706123.ece The Sunday Times, "Home wind turbines dealt killer blow"], April 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Turbines for residential scale use are usually between 7 feet (2 m) to 25 feet (8 m) in diameter and produce electricity at a rate of 900 watts to 10,000 watts at their tested wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidcityjournal.com "Wind turbine, a powerful investment", Rapid City Journal], February 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Building integrated wind turbine performance can be enhanced with the addition of an aerofoil wing on top of a roof mounted turbine.&lt;ref&gt;Factors enhancing aerofoil wings for wind energy harnessing in buildings,7 November 2013 http://bse.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/11/07/0143624413509097.abstract?papetoc&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solar water heating====
{{Main|Solar thermal power}}
[[Solar water heater]]s, also called solar domestic hot water systems, can be a cost-effective way to generate hot water for a home. They can be used in any climate, and the fuel they use—sunshine—is free.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Solar Water Heaters, March 24, 2009 [http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of solar water systems- active and passive. An active solar collector system can produce about 80 to 100 gallons of hot water per day. A passive system will have a lower capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toolbase.org/Technology-Inventory/Plumbing/solar-water-heaters |title=Solar Water Heaters |publisher=Toolbase.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415230351/http://www.toolbase.org/Technology-Inventory/Plumbing/solar-water-heaters |archivedate=2013-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also two types of circulation, direct circulation systems and indirect circulation systems. Direct circulation systems loop the domestic water through the panels. They should not be used in climates with temperatures below freezing. Indirect circulation loops glycol or some other fluid through the solar panels and uses a heat exchanger to heat up the domestic water.

The two most common types of collector panels are Flat-Plate and Evacuated-tube. The two work similarly except that evacuated tubes do not convectively lose heat, which greatly improves their efficiency (5%-25% more efficient). With these higher efficiencies, Evacuated-tube solar collectors can also produce higher-temperature space heating, and even higher temperatures for absorption cooling systems.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"&gt;John Randolph and Gilbert M. Masters, 2008. "Energy for Sustainability: Technology, Planning, Policy," Island Press, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric-resistance water heaters that are common in homes today have an electrical demand around 4500&amp;nbsp;kW·h/year. With the use of solar collectors, the energy use is cut in half. The up-front cost of installing solar collectors is high, but with the annual energy savings, payback periods are relatively short.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

====Heat pumps====
Air-source heat pumps (ASHP) can be thought of as reversible air conditioners. Like an air conditioner, an ASHP can take heat from a relatively cool space (e.g. a house at 70&amp;nbsp;°F) and dump it into a hot place (e.g. outside at 85&amp;nbsp;°F). However, unlike an air conditioner, the condenser and evaporator of an ASHP can switch roles and absorb heat from the cool outside air and dump it into a warm house.

Air-source heat pumps are inexpensive relative to other heat pump systems. However, the efficiency of air-source heat pumps decline when the outdoor temperature is very cold or very hot; therefore, they are only really applicable in temperate climates.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

For areas not located in temperate climates, ground-source (or geothermal) heat pumps provide an efficient alternative. The difference between the two heat pumps is that the ground-source has one of its heat exchangers placed underground—usually in a horizontal or vertical arrangement. Ground-source takes advantage of the relatively constant, mild temperatures underground, which means their efficiencies can be much greater than that of an air-source heat pump. The in-ground heat exchanger generally needs a considerable amount of area. Designers have placed them in an open area next to the building or underneath a parking lot.

Energy Star ground-source heat pumps can be 40% to 60% more efficient than their air-source counterparts. They are also quieter and can also be applied to other functions like domestic hot water heating.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

In terms of initial cost, the ground-source heat pump system costs about twice as much as a standard air-source heat pump to be installed. However, the up-front costs can be more than offset by the decrease in energy costs. The reduction in energy costs is especially apparent in areas with typically hot summers and cold winters.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

Other types of heat pumps are water-source and air-earth. If the building is located near a body of water, the pond or lake could be used as a heat source or sink. Air-earth heat pumps circulate the building's air through underground ducts. With higher fan power requirements and inefficient heat transfer, Air-earth heat pumps are generally not practical for major construction.

==Sustainable building materials==
{{See also|Green building}}
Some examples of sustainable building materials include recycled [[denim]] or blown-in fiber glass insulation, sustainably harvested wood, [[Trass]], [[Linoleum]],&lt;ref&gt;Duurzaam en Gezond Bouwen en Wonen by Hugo Vanderstadt,&lt;/ref&gt; sheep wool, [[concrete]] (high and ultra high performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1864315,00.html|title=Building Materials: Cementing the Future|first=PETER|last=GUMBEL|date=4 December 2008|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; roman self-healing concrete&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6250-6_9|title=Self Healing Materials|first=Henk M.|last=Jonkers|date=23 March 2018|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|pages=195–204|via=link.springer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), panels made from paper flakes, baked earth, rammed earth, clay, vermiculite, flax linnen, sisal, seegrass, expanded clay grains, coconut, wood fiber plates, calcium sand stone, locally obtained stone and rock, and [[bamboo]], which is one of the strongest and fastest growing [[woody plant]]s, and non-toxic low-[[Volatile Organic Compound|VOC]] glues and paints. Vegetative cover or shield over building envelopes also helps in the same. Paper which is fabricated or manufactured out of forest wood is supposedly hundred percent recyclable .thus it regenerates and saves almost all the forest wood that it takes during its manufacturing process.

===Recycled materials===

[[File:Discarded dreams 2 of 3.jpg|thumb|Recycling items for building]]
Sustainable architecture often incorporates the use of recycled or second hand materials, such as [[reclaimed lumber]] and [[Copper in architecture|recycled copper]]. The reduction in use of new materials creates a corresponding reduction in [[embodied energy]] (energy used in the production of materials). Often sustainable architects attempt to retrofit old structures to serve new needs in order to avoid unnecessary development.  Architectural salvage and reclaimed materials are used when appropriate. When older buildings are demolished, frequently any good wood is reclaimed, renewed, and sold as flooring. Any good [[dimension stone]] is similarly reclaimed.  Many other parts are reused as well, such as doors, windows, mantels, and hardware, thus reducing the consumption of new goods.  When new materials are employed, green designers look for materials that are rapidly replenished, such as [[bamboo]], which can be harvested for commercial use after only 6 years of growth, [[sorghum]] or wheat straw, both of which are waste material that can be pressed into panels, or [[cork oak]], in which only the outer bark is removed for use, thus preserving the tree.  When possible, building materials may be gleaned from the site itself; for example, if a new structure is being constructed in a wooded area, wood from the trees which were cut to make room for the building would be re-used as part of the building itself.

===Lower volatile organic compounds===

Low-impact building materials are used wherever feasible: for example, insulation may be made from low VOC ([[volatile organic compound]])-emitting materials such as [[Building insulation materials#Cotton batts (Blue Jean)|recycled denim]] or [[cellulose insulation]], rather than the [[building insulation materials]] that may contain carcinogenic or toxic materials such as formaldehyde. To discourage insect damage, these alternate insulation materials may be treated with [[boric acid]]. Organic or milk-based paints may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Information on low-emitting materials may be found at www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php [http://www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php IAQ links] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611163251/http://www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php |date=2008-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a common fallacy is that "green" materials are always better for the health of occupants or the environment. Many harmful substances (including formaldehyde, arsenic, and asbestos) are naturally occurring and are not without their histories of use with the best of intentions. A study of emissions from materials by the State of California has shown that there are some green materials that have substantial emissions whereas some more "traditional" materials actually were lower emitters. Thus, the subject of emissions must be carefully investigated before concluding that natural materials are always the healthiest alternatives for occupants and for the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Building Emissions Study accessed at [http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/GreenBuilding/Specs/Section01350/METStudy.htm California Integrated Waste Management web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volatile organic compounds (VOC) can be found in any indoor environment coming from a variety of different sources. VOCs have a high vapor pressure and low water solubility, and are suspected of causing [[sick building syndrome]] type symptoms. This is because many VOCs have been known to cause sensory irritation and central nervous system symptoms characteristic to sick building syndrome, indoor concentrations of VOCs are higher than in the outdoor atmosphere, and when there are many VOCs present, they can cause additive and multiplicative effects.

Green products are usually considered to contain fewer VOCs and be better for human and environmental health.   A case study conducted by the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering at the University of Miami that compared three green products and their non-green counterparts found that even though both the green products and the non-green counterparts both emitted levels of VOCs, the amount and intensity of the VOCs emitted from the green products were much safer and comfortable for human exposure.&lt;ref&gt;James, J.P., Yang, X. Indoor and Built Environment, Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds from Several Green and Non-Green Building Materials: A Comparison, January 2004.[http://ibe.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/14/1/69] Retrieved: 2008-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials sustainability standards===
Despite the importance of materials to overall building sustainability, quantifying and evaluating the sustainability of building materials has proven difficult. There is little coherence in the measurement and assessment of materials sustainability attributes, resulting in a landscape today that is littered with hundreds of competing, inconsistent and often imprecise eco-labels, [[Technical standard|standards]] and [[certifications]].  This discord has led both to confusion among consumers and commercial purchasers and to the incorporation of inconsistent sustainability criteria in larger building certification programs such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]].  Various proposals have been made regarding rationalization of the standardization landscape for sustainable building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1944523|title=Toward a Rational Framework for Sustainable Building Materials Standards|first1=Jorge L.|last1=Contreras|first2=Hannah|last2=Roth|first3=Meghan|last3=Lewis|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waste management==
Waste takes the form of spent or useless materials generated from households and businesses, construction and demolition processes, and manufacturing and agricultural industries. These materials are loosely categorized as municipal solid waste, construction and demolition (C&amp;D) debris, and industrial or agricultural by-products.&lt;ref&gt;John Ringel., University of Michigan, Sustainable Architecture, Waste Prevention [http://www.umich.edu/~nppcpub/resources/compendia/ARCHpdfs/ARCHr&amp;rA.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustainable architecture focuses on the on-site use of [[waste management]], incorporating things such as [[grey water]] systems for use on garden beds, and [[composting toilet]]s to reduce sewage. These methods, when combined with on-site food waste composting and off-site recycling, can reduce a house's waste to a small amount of packaging waste. 

==Building placement==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
One central and often ignored aspect of sustainable architecture is building placement. Although the ideal environmental home or office structure is often envisioned as an isolated place, this kind of placement is usually detrimental to the environment. First, such structures often serve as the unknowing frontlines of [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Second, they usually increase the [[energy consumption]] required for transportation and lead to unnecessary auto emissions. Ideally, most building should avoid suburban sprawl in favor of the kind of light [[Urban planning|urban development]] articulated by the [[New Urbanist]] movement. Careful mixed use zoning can make commercial, residential, and light industrial areas more accessible for those traveling by foot, bicycle, or public transit, as proposed in the [[Principles of Intelligent Urbanism]]. The study of [[Permaculture]], in its holistic application, can also greatly help in proper building placement that minimizes energy consumption and works with the surroundings rather than against them, especially in rural and forested zones.

==Sustainable building consulting==
A sustainable building consultant may be engaged early in the design process, to forecast the sustainability implications of [[building materials]], orientation, glazing and other physical factors, so as to identify a sustainable approach that meets the specific requirements of a project.

Norms and standards have been formalized by performance-based rating systems e.g. [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/?CategoryID=19|title=U.S. Green Building Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Energy Star]] for homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/|title=ENERGY STAR - The Simple Choice for Energy Efficiency|website=www.energystar.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; They define [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]] to be met and provide [[Performance metric|metrics]] and testing to meet those benchmarks. It is up to the parties involved in the project to determine the best approach to meet those standards.

==Changing pedagogues==

Critics of the reductionism of modernism often noted the abandonment of the teaching of architectural history as a causal factor. The fact that a number of the major players in the shift away from modernism were trained at Princeton University's School of Architecture, where recourse to history continued to be a part of design training in the 1940s and 1950s, was significant. The increasing rise of interest in history had a profound impact on architectural education. History courses became more typical and regularized. With the demand for professors knowledgeable in the history of architecture, several PhD programs in schools of architecture arose in order to differentiate themselves from art history PhD programs, where architectural historians had previously trained. In the US, [[MIT]] and [[Cornell]] were the first, created in the mid-1970s, followed by [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Among the founders of new architectural history programs were [[Bruno Zevi]] at the Institute for the History of Architecture in Venice, Stanford Anderson and Henry Millon at MIT, Alexander Tzonis at the [[Architectural Association]], Anthony Vidler at Princeton, [[Manfredo Tafuri]] at the University of Venice, [[Kenneth Frampton]] at [[Columbia University]], and Werner Oechslin and Kurt Forster at [[ETH Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]], “The Disciplinary Dislocations of Architectural History,” ''Journal of the [[Society of Architectural Historians]]'' 58/3 (September 1999), p. 489. See also other articles in that issue by Eve Blau, Stanford Anderson, Alina Payne, Daniel Bluestone, Jeon-Louis Cohen and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “sustainability” in relation to architecture has so far been mostly considered through the lens of building technology and its transformations. Going beyond the technical sphere of “green” design, invention and expertise, some scholars are starting to position architecture within a much broader cultural framework of the [[Nature#Human interrelationship|human interrelationship with nature]]. Adopting this framework allows tracing a rich history of cultural debates about our relationship to nature and the environment, from the point of view of different historical and geographical contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Brian|title=Urban Design Ecologies: AD Reader|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-0-470-97405-6|pages=220–237|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470974052.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable urbanism and architecture==
Concurrently, the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical Architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/charter|title=The Charter of the New Urbanism|first=|last=taotiadmin|date=20 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as leaning against solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="Driehaus Prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize|url=http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/|work=''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''|publisher=Notre Dame School of Architecture|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There are conflicting ethical, engineering, and political orientations depending on the viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Sustainability - Architecture: between Fuzzy Systems and Wicked Problems |author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Blueprints  | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/blueprints21_1.pdf | volume=21 | issue=1 | pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no doubt Green Technology has made its headway into the architectural community, the implementation of given technologies have changed the ways we see and perceive modern day architecture. While green architecture has been proven to show great improvements of ways of living both environmentally and technologically the question remains, is all this sustainable? Many building codes have been demeaned to international standards. "LEED" (Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design) has been criticized for exercising flexible codes for building to follow. Contractors do this to save as much money as they possibly can. For example, a building may have solar paneling but if the infrastructure of the building's core doesn't support that over a long period of time improvements would have to be made on a constant basis and the building itself would be vulnerable to disasters or enhancements. With companies cutting paths to make shortcuts with sustainable architecture when building their structures it fuels to the irony that the "sustainable" architecture isn't sustainable at all. Sustainability comes in reference to longevity and effectiveness. 

Ethics and Politics also play into sustainable architecture and its ability to grow in urban environment. Conflicting viewpoints between engineering techniques and environmental impacts still are popular issues that resonate in the architectural community. With every revolutionary technology or innovation there comes criticisms of legitimacy and effectiveness when and how it is being utilized. Many of the criticisms of sustainable architecture do not reflect every aspect of it but rather a broader spectrum across the international community.

'''System requirements''' in [[spacecraft systems]] are the specific [[system requirements]] needed to design and operate a [[spacecraft]] or a [[Spacecraft#Subsystems|spacecraft subsystem]].

== Overview ==
[[Image:Systems Engineering Process II.svg|thumb|300px|The [[V-Model]] of the general Systems Development Life Cycle.&lt;ref name="FHWA 05"&gt;[http://www.itsdocs.fhwa.dot.gov/jpodocs/repts_te/14158.htm ''Clarus Concept of Operations.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705102900/http://www.itsdocs.fhwa.dot.gov/jpodocs/repts_te/14158.htm |date=2009-07-05 }} Publication No. FHWA-JPO-05-072, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), 2005&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Spacecraft system]]s are normally developed under the responsibility of space agencies as [[NASA]], [[ESA]] etc. In the space area standardized terms and processes have been introduced to allow for unambiguous communication between all partners and efficient usage of all documents. For instance the [[Systems Development Life Cycle|life cycle]] of space systems is divided in phases:{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}
* Phase A:   Feasibility Study
* Phase B:   Requirements Definition
* Phase C/D: Design / Manufacturing / Verification
* Phase E:   Operational usage.
At the end of phase B the system requirements together with a [[statement of work]] are sent out requesting proposals from industry.

=== Technical systems requirement ===
The technical system requirements documented in the System Specification stay on mission level:{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}
* System functions and performances
* Orbit
* Launch vehicle
* etc.
whereas the non-technical system (task) requirements 
* Cost and progress reporting
* Documentation maintenance
* etc.
are contained in the statement of work.

The customer (requirements) specification is answered by the contractor by a design-to specification.

For example, the requirement "Columbus shall be launched by the Space Shuttle." is detailed in the contractor system specification "Columbus shall be a cylindrical pressurized module with max. length of 6.9 meters and 4.5 meters diameter as agreed in the Shuttle/Columbus ICD."

[[Image:Requirements Allocation Sheet.jpg|thumb|600px|center|Systems requirements can be specified in a "Requirements Allocation Sheet".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211165311/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |date=2006-02-11 }} Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Operations environment ===
The spacecraft's systems specification, according to David Michael Harland (2005), usually also defines the operation environment of the spacecraft. It mostly is defined "as a model - often provide by the scientific community from available data - in the form of a set of curves, numerical tables, or software, usually with a nominal expectation and the minimal and maximum profiles which the environment is not expected to exceed".&lt;ref&gt;David Michael Harland, Ralph Lorenz (2005), ''Space Systems Failures: Disasters and Rescues of Satellites, Rockets'', Springer, p.178.&lt;/ref&gt;

== System specification structure ==
A typical industry generated [[Specification (technical standard)|system specification]] for a spacecraft has the following structure (e.g. Columbus Design Spec (COL-RIBRE-SPE-0028, iss.10/F, 06.25.2004):
* Document change record
* 1. Scope
** 1.1 Purpose
** 1.2 Summary description
** 1.3 Classification
** 1.4 Applicability
* 2. Related documents
** 2.1 Applicable documents (incl. order of precedence)
** 2.2 Reference documents
* 3. Functional /Performance Requirements
* 4. Support requirements
** 4.1 Product assurance
** 4.2 Electro-magnetic compatibility
** 4.3 Contamination
** 4.4 etc.
* 5. Interface requirements
** 5.1 System interfaces
*** 5.1.1 Launcher
*** 5.1.2 Ground stations
*** 5.1.3 etc.
** 5.2 Subsystem interfaces
*** 5.2.1 Electrical power
*** 5.2.2 Data
*** 5.2.3 etc.
* 6. Implementation requirements
** 6.1 Configuration
** 6.2 Budget Allocations
*** 6.2.1 Mass
*** 6.2.2 Electrical power
*** 6.2.3 etc.
* 7. Preparation for delivery
* Attachments (Abbreviation list etc.)

Each requirement paragraph consists of the requirement to be fulfilled by the product to be delivered and the verification requirement (Review of design, analysis, test, inspection).

== Specification tree ==
The spacecraft system specification defines also the subsystems of the spacecraft e.g.:{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}
* Structure
* Data management subsystem incl. software
* Electrical Power
* Mechanical
* etc.
For each subsystem a subsystem specification is prepared by the Prime Contractor with the same specification structure shown above including references to the parent paragraph in the system specification. In the same way the subsystem contractor prepares an assembly or unit specification. All these specifications are listed in a so-called [[specification tree]] showing all specifications and their linkage as well as the issue / date of each specification.

==Early life==
Vang, an ethnic Hmong, was born on 8 December 1929,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=FB&amp;p_theme=fb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAE887C2383BF87&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Revered Hmong leader Vang Pao stands tall in two worlds...|date=1 January 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/08/world/asia/08vangpao.html|work=The New York Times|first=Douglas|last=Martin|title=Vang Pao, Laotian General Who Aided U.S., Dies at 81|date=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a Hmong village named [[Nong Het|Nonghet]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpt.org/hmong/bios.html Profile on] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218042220/http://www.wpt.org/hmong/bios.html |date=2011-02-18 }}, [[Wisconsin Public Television]]. Retrieved 19 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; located in Central [[Xiangkhuang Province]], in the northeastern region of [[Laos]], where his father, Neng Chu Vang, was a county leader.

Vang began his early life as a farmer until [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces invaded and occupied [[French Indochina]] in [[World War II]]. His father sent him away to school from the age of 10 to 15&lt;ref name="Stephen Magagnini"/&gt; before he launched his military career, joining the [[French Military]] to protect fellow Hmong during the Japanese invasion. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

While taking an entrance examination, the captain who was the proctor realized that Vang knew almost no written French. The captain dictated the answers to Vang so he could join the army. Vang insisted the captain gave him the answers but did not actually guide his hand on the paper. [[Anne Fadiman]], author of ''[[The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down]]'', said Vang did not express any embarrassment over this cheating. Fadiman added "it is worth noting that in this incident, far from tarnishing Vang Pao's reputation — as, for example [[Ted Kennedy]]'s fudged [[Spanish language|Spanish]] exam at [[Harvard University]] tarnished his — merely added to his mythology: this was the sort of man who could never be held back by such petty impediments as rules."&lt;ref name="Fadiman129"&gt;[[Anne Fadiman|Fadiman, Anne]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DUHAXXvSUeYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Spirit+Catches+You+and+You+Fall+Down ''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down''], Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 1997; p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
{{details|topic=covert war in Laos|Laotian Civil War}}
The term "Mèo [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]" was originally used by [[Free French]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[intelligence]] officers to describe the Hmong resistance forces working against the Japanese forces occupying [[Indochina]] and [[China]] during World War II. After World War II, French [[Groupement de Commandos Mixtes Aéroportés]] (GCMA) authorities recruited Vang as a lieutenant during the [[First Indochina War]] to combat the [[Viet Minh]] ({{YouTube|9n0Tc_9NN3A|archive video}} by Col. [[Jean Sassi]]).

He was the only ethnic Hmong to attain the rank of General officer in the [[Royal Lao Army]], and he was loyal to the [[King of Laos]] while remaining a champion of the [[Hmong people]]. During the 1960s/70s, he commanded the [[Laotian Civil War|Secret Army]], also known as the Hmong Army, a highly-effective [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-trained and supported force that fought against the [[Pathet Lao]] and [[People's Army of Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]'', "The Montagnard Moses", 15 January 2011, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Vang's ethnic Hmong and Laotian veterans and their refugee families who served in the U.S. "Secret Army" were eventually granted the status of political refugees by the [[United Nations]] because of persecution and genocide by the Lao [[Marxist]] government and [[communist]] Vietnam who took control in 1975. The Lao and Hmong refugees were allowed to resettle in the United States, France, [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and elsewhere. Many of Vang's former veterans formed the [[Lao Veterans of America]], Inc. and the Lao Veterans of America Institute, with offices in [[Fresno, California]], [[Washington, D.C.]] and other locales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laoveteransofamerica.org Lao Veterans of America, Inc.], retrieved 3 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration to the United States==
Vang emigrated to the United States after the communists seized power in Laos in 1975. He and his wife, [[May Song Vang]], whom he married in 1973, initially moved first to [[Montana]] before settling in California.&lt;ref name=fbee&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=May Song Vang, widow of Gen. Vang Pao, dies at 62|url=http://www.fresnobee.com/2013/08/06/3427620/widow-of-gen-vang-pao-dies.html|work=[[Fresno Bee]]|publisher=|date=2013-08-06|accessdate=2013-09-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901213533/http://www.fresnobee.com/2013/08/06/3427620/widow-of-gen-vang-pao-dies.html|archivedate=2013-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained widely respected by his fellow Hmong and was an esteemed elder of the American Hmong people, many of whom experienced the war or the [[Conflict in Laos involving the Hmong|reprisals]] that followed. Though he was somewhat less influential among younger Hmong-Americans who have grown up primarily in the United States, he generally was considered an influential leader of U.S.-based Hmong, enjoying great loyalty for his position of leadership and respect for his military accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Toni|last=Randolph|author2=Greta Cunningham |title=Hmong community reacts with alarm to charges against Vang Pao|date=5 June 2007|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/06/05/vangpao|publisher=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|accessdate=10 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in exile, Vang assembled other Lao and Hmong leaders from around the world to create the [[United Lao National Liberation Front]] (ULNF), also known as the Lao National Liberation Movement or simply the [[Neo Hom]], to bring attention to atrocities happening in Laos and to support the political and military resistance to the government of the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Hamilton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWIj5Q8l08wC&amp;pg=PA586&amp;dq=Tragic+mountains:+the+Hmong,+the+Americans,+and+the+secret+wars+for+Laos ''Tragic mountains: the Hmong, the Americans, and the secret wars for Laos'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2017}} He was one of the eight founders of the organization in 1981, along with Prince [[Sisouk na Champassak]], General [[Phoumi Nosavan]] and General [[Kouprasith Abhay]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Thousands of Vang's former ethnic Laotian and Hmong veterans, and their refugee families, in the United States also formed the non-profit veterans and advocacy organizations the Lao Veterans of America and the Lao Veterans of America Institute. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Vang, aided by his adviser, Philip Smith, and influential American diplomatic allies, Members of Congress, and vast numbers of Hmong-Americans, helped halt the forced [[United Nations]]-sponsored repatriation back to Laos of thousands of Laotian and Hmong refugees in [[Thailand]]. It was a major human rights victory for the Hmong and Lao community and non-profit advocacy organizations who urged an end to forced repatriation, including the [[Center for Public Policy Analysis]] (CPPA) and the [[Lao Veterans of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Marc, Knight-Ridder / Tribune News Service (8 April 1996) "Hmong refugees will now be allowed to enter the U.S." http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18164641.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Washington, Wayne, Star Tribune (Minneapolis, Minnesota) (17 April 1996) "Agencies say influx of Hmong will go smoothly" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62628182.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Capital Times (Madison, Wisconsin) "NEW WAVE OF LAOTIAN REFUGEES ON THE WAY HUNDREDS EXPECTED TO COME TO STATE" (18 April 1996) http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69595349.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Ben, Washington Times (Washington, D.C.) (22 April 1996) "3,500 Laotians Head for U.S. after 20 Years in Thailand" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56867976.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Vang's residence in the U.S., the Hmong leader diplomatically opposed human rights violations by the communist government of Laos against the Hmong and Laotian people. He was invited to speak at the U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos, with Members of Congress, about the persecution of the Laotian and Hmong people on several occasions in the U.S. Congress from 1999 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforpublicpolicyanalysis.org Center for Public Policy Analysis]; accessed 6 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993-2003, Vang relied on Philip Smith for much of his efforts with policymakers in Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Congress.

Many of Vang's former veterans and their families, whose relatives were still being persecuted and killed in Laos, opposed Vang's change of stance on the issue of Normalized Trade Relations (NTR), or Most Favored Nation Trade Status (MFN), with Laos. This included the Lao Veterans of America, the Center for Public Policy Analysis and others.

==Coup d'etat conspiracy==
{{Main|2007 Laotian coup d'état conspiracy allegation}}
On 4 June 2007, following a lengthy federal investigation labeled "Operation Tarnished Eagle", warrants were issued by U.S. federal courts ordering the arrest of Vang Pao and nine others for allegedly plotting to overthrow the Pathet Lao communist government of Laos, in violation of the federal [[Neutrality Act of 1794|Neutrality Acts]]. Following the issuance of the warrants, an estimated 250 federal agents representing numerous U.S. federal law enforcement and other agencies conducted simultaneous raids on homes, offices and other locations throughout central and southern [[California]], arresting Vang and nine other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/06/04/laos.arrests/index.html "Ten Charged with Alleged Laos Plot"], CNN, 4 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The federal charges alleged that members of the group inspected weapons, including [[AK-47]]s, smoke grenades, and Stinger missiles, with the intent of purchasing them and smuggling them into Thailand, where they allegedly would be shipped to anti-Laotian governmental [[resistance movement]] forces inside Laos. The one non-Hmong person among the nine arrested, Harrison Jack, a 1968 [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate and retired Army infantry officer, allegedly attempted to recruit [[Special Operations]] veterans to act as mercenaries in an invasion of Laos. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The Pathet Lao Marxist government Laos was engaged in serious human rights violations, including military attacks on civilians by the [[Lao People's Army]] in Laos in 2007 and prior, according to [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], the Center for Public Policy Analysis, the Lao Veterans of America, the Lao Human Rights Council, headed by Dr. [[Vang Pobzeb]], Members of the [[United States Congress]] and others. [[Vietnam People's Army]] forces were also involved with military attacks on the Hmong people in Laos and illegal logging activities driving many Hmong from their mountain homelands.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Philip, Center for Public Policy Analysis, Washington, D.C.

On 15 June 2007, defendants were indicted by a grand jury and an 11th man was arrested in connection with the alleged plot. The defendants face possible life prison terms for violation of the U.S. Neutrality Act and various weapons charges. Vang and the other Hmong were initially denied bail by the California federal court, which cited each of them as a flight risk. Since the 4 June 2007 federal raid, the arrests became the subject of mounting criticism. His fellow friends, including Hmong, Mienh, Lao, Vietnamese, and Americans individuals who knew Vang protested the arrests, rallying in California, Minnesota, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin. Several of Vang's high-level U.S. supporters criticized the California court that issued the arrest warrants. In 2009 all of the federal charges against Vang Pao were dropped.&lt;ref name="20090919-nytimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/us/19general.html U.S. Drops Case Against Exiled Hmong Leader", ''The New York Times'', 18 September 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his arrest, Vang was scheduled to have an elementary school in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] named after him, a proposal that met with opposition over controversial academic [[Alfred W.

===Release from jail===
On 12 July 2007, under significant pressure from Vang's Hmong and influential American supporters, the California federal court ordered the release of the Hmong leader on a US$1.5 million bond secured by property owned by members of his family. Many Hmong had participated in numerous protests over several weeks in California and elsewhere, calling for Pao's release from the date of his incarceration until his release under bail nearly a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/07/13/vangpaoreleased|title=Pao released on bail|publisher=Minnesota.publicradio.org|date=13 July 2007|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to court===
On 9 March 2009, Vang's lawyers filed a motion seeking to dismiss the charges against him. His lawyers claimed that the charges were fabricated and had no bearing in court. Following this appearance, on 6 April 2009, federal prosecutors denied all allegations of fabrications in the motion. That following month, on 11 May 2009, Vang Pao returned to federal court in [[Sacramento, California]] with his lawyers to argue the motion. Judge Frank Damrell stated, after hearing the arguments for the motion, that there was insufficient evidence from the defense to justify a dismissal. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Dropping of charges ===
On 18 September 2009, the federal government dropped all charges against Vang Pao, announcing in a release that the federal government was permitted to consider "the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted."&lt;ref name="20090919-nytimes"/&gt; Vang Pao's long-time adviser and friend Philip Smith hailed the federal government's decision to drop the charges against Vang and the other accused Hmong-American defendants. Following Vang's arrest, Smith advocated in Washington, D.C. for the case to be dropped against Vang and other Hmong leaders. Smith raised repeated public concerns that the U.S. Justice Department and U.S. Department of States, would be putting themselves and the U.S. government on trial, for its betrayal and abandonment of the Hmong people during the conclusion of the Vietnam War and its aftermath when many Hmong were killed or imprisoned by the Lao communist government that prevailed in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'' (19 September 2009) [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/19/local/me-vang-pao19/2 "Federal charges dropped against Hmong leader Vang Pao: The exiled general was accused of plotting to overthrow the communist regime in Laos"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press/''USA TODAY'' (17 July 2007) [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2007-07-17-1201509033_x.htm "Hmong supporters criticize indictments"]&lt;/ref&gt;

At special sessions of the U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos, Smith and the Center for Public Policy Analysis joined by Members of Congress, including U.S. Representative [[Dana Rohrabacher]], and others, called on the U.S. Department of Justice to immediately drop the case, and the charges, against General Vang and the other Hmong defendants, especially in light of the Lao government's and Lao Peoples Army's (LPA) ongoing military attacks and egregious human rights violations directed against many of the Laotian and Hmong people, which included attacks on unarmed civilians and political and religious dissidents, atrocities, rape, torture and the use of mass starvation.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Congressional Record, US GPO    (27 October 2000) [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-28/html/CREC-2000-10-28-pt1-PgE2004-3.htm "IMPORTANCE OF THE ONGOING U.S. CONGRESSIONAL FORUM ON LAOS..."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (1 January 2001) [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/713517/Laos-Year-In-Review-2000 "Laos: Year in Review-2000"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Congressional Record, U.S. Government Printing Office (24 October 2002) [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-10-24/html/CREC-2002-10-24-pt1-PgE1958-2.htm "Statement of the Honorable Patrick Kennedy: US Congressional Forum on Laos"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, (6 May 2006) [https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/527 "Laos: Massacre of unarmed Hmong women and children"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407230759/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/527/ |date=2016-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Front Page Magazine'' (28 February 2008) [http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=30050 "The Two Faces of Communist Laos"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, following Vang's death, the CPPA issued an editorial, published in the ''Minneapolis Star Tribune'', critical of the decision by the U.S. Secretary of the Army not permitting Vang's burial in Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref name="startribune.com"/&gt; Despite the U.S. Secretary of the Army's unpopular and widely criticized decision, the CPPA, along with the Lao Veterans of America Institute, [[Lao Veterans of America]], Inc. (LVA), and others helped to organize national veterans ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery in May 2011 to honor Vang's contribution to U.S. national security efforts during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;Agence France Press (AFP) &amp; Asia One News, (13 May 2011) [http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/World/Story/A1Story20110513-278644.html "Vietnam vet to get US honors after burial snub"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lao Veterans of America, Philip Smith, the CPPA and other prominent figures also highlighted and lauded Vang Pao's contribution to U.S. national security interests during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;Agence France Press (AFP) (9 January 2011) "California funeral planned for Hmong general" http://www.thefreelibrary.com/California+funeral+planned+for+Hmong+general-a01612410970&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, Vang's efforts during the Vietnam War were officially commemorated at memorial ceremonies in Arlington National Cemetery organized by the Lao Veterans of America Institute, LVA, the CPPA, the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Special Forces Association, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Agence France Press/''Asia One News'' (13 May 2011) "Vietnam vet to get US honors after burial snub" http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/World/Story/A1Story20110513-278644.html&lt;/ref&gt; Participants at the special ceremony held at the [[Laos Memorial]] within Arlington National Cemetery included the CPPA, LVA, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of the Army, Members of the Congress, U.S. Special Forces Association, Counterparts Veterans Association and others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13281">In [[mathematics]], a '''volume form''' on a [[differentiable manifold]] is a top-dimensional form (i.e., a [[differential form]] of top degree).   Thus on a manifold ''M'' of dimension ''n'', a volume form is an ''n''-form, a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[line bundle]] {{nowrap|1=Ω&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') = &amp;#x22C0;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''T''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''M'')}}.  A manifold admits a nowhere vanishing volume form if and only if it is orientable. An [[orientable manifold]] has infinitely many volume forms, since multiplying a volume form by a function yields another volume form. On non-orientable manifolds, one may instead define the weaker notion of a [[Density on a manifold|density]].

A volume form provides a means to define the [[integral]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] on a differentiable manifold.  In other words, a volume form gives rise to a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] with respect to which functions can be integrated by the appropriate [[Lebesgue integral]].  The absolute value of a volume form is a [[volume element]], which is also known variously as a ''twisted volume form'' or ''pseudo-volume form''.  It also defines a measure, but exists on any differentiable manifold, orientable or not.

[[Kähler manifold]]s, being [[complex manifold]]s, are naturally oriented, and so possess a volume form.  More generally, the ''n''th [[exterior power]] of the symplectic form on a [[symplectic manifold]] is a volume form. Many classes of manifolds have canonical volume forms: they have extra structure which allows the choice of a preferred volume form.  Oriented [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s have an associated canonical volume form.

== Orientation ==
A manifold is [[orientable]] if it has a [[coordinate atlas]] all of whose transition functions have positive [[Jacobian determinant]]s.  A selection of a maximal such atlas is an orientation on ''M''.  A volume form ''ω'' on ''M'' gives rise to an orientation in a natural way as the atlas of coordinate charts on ''M'' that send ''ω'' to a positive multiple of the Euclidean volume form &lt;math&gt;dx^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^n&lt;/math&gt;.

A volume form also allows for the specification of a preferred class of [[moving frame|frames]] on ''M''. Call a basis of tangent vectors (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) right-handed if

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n) &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The collection of all right-handed frames is [[group action|acted upon]] by the [[group (mathematics)|group]] GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') of [[general linear group|general linear]] mappings in ''n'' dimensions with positive determinant.  They form a [[principal bundle|principal GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') sub-bundle]] of the [[linear frame bundle]] of ''M'', and so the orientation associated to a volume form gives a canonical reduction of the frame bundle of ''M'' to a sub-bundle with structure group GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'').  That is to say that a volume form gives rise to [[G-structure|GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'')-structure]] on ''M''.  More reduction is clearly possible by considering frames that have

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\omega(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Thus a volume form gives rise to an SL(''n'')-structure as well.  Conversely, given an SL(''n'')-structure, one can recover a volume form by imposing ({{EquationNote|1}}) for the special linear frames and then solving for the required ''n''-form ''ω'' by requiring homogeneity in its arguments.

A manifold is orientable if and only if it has a volume form.  Indeed, {{nowrap|SL(''n'') → GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'')}} is a [[deformation retract]] since {{nowrap|1=GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = SL × '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where the [[positive reals]] are embedded as scalar matrices.  Thus every GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'')-structure is reducible to an SL(''n'')-structure, and GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'')-structures coincide with orientations on ''M''.  More concretely, triviality of the determinant bundle &lt;math&gt;\Omega^n(M)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to orientability, and a line bundle is trivial if and only if it has a nowhere-vanishing section. Thus the existence of a volume form is equivalent to orientability.

== Relation to measures ==
{{See also|Density on a manifold}}
Given a volume form ''ω'' on an oriented manifold, the [[density on a manifold|density]] {{abs|''ω''}} is a volume [[pseudotensor|pseudo-form]] on the nonoriented manifold obtained by forgetting the orientation. Densities may also be defined more generally on non-orientable manifolds.

Any volume pseudo-form ''ω'' (and therefore also any volume form) defines a measure on the [[Borel set]]s by
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_\omega(U)=\int_U\omega .&lt;/math&gt;

The difference is that while a measure can be integrated over a (Borel) ''subset'', a volume form can only be integrated over an ''oriented'' cell. In single variable [[calculus]], writing &lt;math&gt;\int_b^a f\,dx = -\int_a^b f\,dx&lt;/math&gt; considers &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; as a volume form, not simply a measure, and &lt;math&gt;\int_b^a&lt;/math&gt; indicates "integrate over the cell &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; with the opposite orientation, sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;\overline{[a,b]}&lt;/math&gt;".

Further, general measures need not be continuous or smooth: they need not be defined by a volume form, or more formally, their [[Radon–Nikodym derivative]] with respect to a given volume form need not be [[absolutely continuous]].

==Divergence==
Given a volume form ''ω'' on ''M'', one can define the [[divergence]] of a [[vector field]] ''X'' as the unique scalar-valued function, denoted by div&amp;nbsp;''X'', satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{div} X)\omega = L_X\omega = d(X\;\lrcorner\;\omega) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[Lie derivative]] along ''X'' and &lt;math&gt;X\;\lrcorner\;\omega&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[interior product]] or the left [[tensor contraction|contraction]] of ''ω'' along ''X''. If ''X'' is a [[compact support|compactly supported]] vector field and ''M'' is a [[manifold with boundary]], then [[Stokes' theorem]] implies

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M (\operatorname{div} X)\omega = \int_{\partial M} X\;\lrcorner\;\omega,&lt;/math&gt;

which is a generalization of the [[divergence theorem]].

The [[solenoidal]] vector fields are those with {{nowrap|1=div ''X'' = 0}}.  It follows from the definition of the Lie derivative that the volume form is preserved under the [[vector flow|flow]] of a solenoidal vector field.  Thus solenoidal vector fields are precisely those that have volume-preserving flows.  This fact is well-known, for instance, in [[fluid mechanics]] where the divergence of a velocity field measures the compressibility of a fluid, which in turn represents the extent to which volume is preserved along flows of the fluid.

==Special cases==

=== Lie groups ===

For any [[Lie group]], a natural volume form may be defined by translation.  That is, if ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;{\textstyle\bigwedge}^n T_e^*G&lt;/math&gt;, then a left-invariant form may be defined by &lt;math&gt;\omega_g=L_{g^{-1}}^*\omega_e&lt;/math&gt;, where ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; is left-translation.  As a corollary, every Lie group is orientable.  This volume form is unique up to a scalar, and the corresponding measure is known as the [[Haar measure]].

=== Symplectic manifolds ===

Any [[symplectic manifold]] (or indeed any [[almost symplectic manifold]]) has a natural volume form.  If ''M'' is a 2''n''-dimensional manifold with [[symplectic form]] ''ω'', then ''ω''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is nowhere zero as a consequence of the [[nondegeneracy]] of the symplectic form.  As a corollary, any symplectic manifold is orientable (indeed, oriented).  If the manifold is both symplectic and Riemannian, then the two volume forms agree if the manifold is [[Kähler manifold|Kähler]].

=== Riemannian volume form ===

Any [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] (including [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]]) [[manifold]] has a natural volume form.  In [[local coordinates]], it can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{|g|} dx^1\wedge \dots \wedge dx^n&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;dx^i&lt;/math&gt; are [[1-form]]s that form a positively oriented basis for the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold.  Here, &lt;math&gt;|g|&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold.

The volume form is denoted variously by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \mathrm{vol}_n = \varepsilon = {\star}(1) .&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the {{math|⋆}} is the [[Hodge star]], thus the last form, {{math|⋆(1)}}, emphasizes that the volume form is the Hodge dual of the constant map on the manifold, which equals the [[Levi-Civita tensor|Levi-Civita ''tensor'']] ''ε''.

Although the Greek letter ''ω'' is frequently used to denote the volume form, this notation is not universal; the symbol ''ω'' often carries many other meanings in [[differential geometry]] (such as a symplectic form).

==Invariants of a volume form==
Volume forms are not unique; they form a [[torsor]] over non-vanishing functions on the manifold, as follows. Given a non-vanishing function ''f'' on ''M'', and a volume form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;f\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a volume form on ''M''. Conversely, given two volume forms &lt;math&gt;\omega, \omega'&lt;/math&gt;, their ratio is a non-vanishing function (positive if they define the same orientation, negative if they define opposite orientations).

In coordinates, they are both simply a non-zero function times [[Lebesgue measure]], and their ratio is the ratio of the functions, which is independent of choice of coordinates. Intrinsically, it is the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem#Radon.E2.80.93Nikodym derivative|Radon–Nikodym derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;\omega'&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.  On an oriented manifold, the proportionality of any two volume forms can be thought of as a geometric form of the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem]].

===No local structure===
A volume form on a manifold has no local structure in the sense that it is not possible on small open sets to distinguish between the given volume form and the volume form on Euclidean space {{harv|Kobayashi|1972}}.  That is, for every point ''p'' in ''M'', there is an open neighborhood ''U'' of ''p'' and a [[diffeomorphism]] ''&amp;phi;'' of ''U'' onto an open set in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that the volume form on ''U'' is the [[pullback]] of &lt;math&gt;dx^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^n&lt;/math&gt; along ''&amp;phi;''.

As a corollary, if ''M'' and ''N'' are two manifolds, each with volume forms &lt;math&gt;\omega_M, \omega_N&lt;/math&gt;, then for any points &lt;math&gt;m\in M, n\in N&lt;/math&gt;, there are open neighborhoods ''U'' of ''m'' and ''V'' of ''n'' and a map &lt;math&gt;f\colon U \to V&lt;/math&gt; such that the volume form on ''N'' restricted to the neighborhood ''V'' pulls back to volume form on ''M'' restricted to the neighborhood ''U'': &lt;math&gt;f^*\omega_N\vert_V = \omega_M\vert_U&lt;/math&gt;.

In one dimension, one can prove it thus:
given a volume form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;, define
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) := \int_0^x \omega.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the standard [[Lebesgue measure]] &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pulls back]] to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; under ''f'': &lt;math&gt;\omega = f^*dx&lt;/math&gt;. Concretely, &lt;math&gt;\omega = f'\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.  In higher dimensions, given any point &lt;math&gt;m \in M&lt;/math&gt;, it has a neighborhood locally homeomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{R}^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and one can apply the same procedure.

===Global structure: volume===
A volume form on a connected manifold ''M'' has a single global invariant, namely the (overall) volume (denoted &lt;math&gt;\mu(M)&lt;/math&gt;), which is invariant under volume-form preserving maps; this may be infinite, such as for Lebesgue measure on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. On a disconnected manifold, the volume of each connected component is the invariant.

In symbols, if &lt;math&gt;f\colon M \to N&lt;/math&gt; is a homeomorphism of manifolds that pulls back &lt;math&gt;\omega_N&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\omega_M&lt;/math&gt;, then

: &lt;math&gt;\mu(N)=\int_N \omega_N = \int_{f(M)} \omega_N = \int_M f^*\omega_N = \int_M \omega_M=\mu(M)\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the manifolds have the same volume.

Volume forms can also be pulled back under [[covering map]]s, in which case they multiply volume by the cardinality of the fiber (formally, by integration along the fiber). In the case of an infinite sheeted cover (such as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} \to S^1&lt;/math&gt;), a volume form on a finite volume manifold pulls back to a volume form on an infinite volume manifold.

'''Zionism''' ({{lang-he-n|צִיּוֹנוּת}} ''Tsiyyonut'' {{IPA-he|t͡sijo̞ˈnut|}} after ''[[Zion]]'') is the [[Ethnic nationalism|national]] movement of the [[Jewish people]] that supports the re-establishment of a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish homeland]] in the territory defined as the historic [[Land of Israel]] (roughly corresponding to [[Canaan]], the [[Holy Land]], or the region of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]).{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=604.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herzl |first1=Theodor |authorlink1=Theodor Herzl |translator= Sylvie d'Avigdor |title=Der Judenstaat |trans-title=The Jewish state |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3f4RFWkMeWoC |accessdate=September 28, 2010 |edition=republication |year=1988 |origyear=1896 |publisher=[[Dover Publications|Courier Dover]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-486-25849-2 |page=40 |chapter=Biography, by Alex Bein |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=3f4RFWkMeWoC&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/zionism|title=Zionism |work=Oxford Dictionary |access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zionism|title=Zionism {{!}} nationalistic movement|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Zionism emerged in the late 19th century in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] as a national revival movement, both in reaction to newer waves of [[antisemitism]] and as an imitative response to other nationalist movements.&lt;ref name="Shillony2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Ami Shillony|authorlink=Ben-Ami Shillony|title=Jews &amp; the Japanese: The Successful Outsiders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OvzPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88|date=January 24, 2012|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-1-4629-0396-2|page=88|quote='(Zionism) arose in response to and in imitation of the current national movements of Central, Southern, and Eastern Europe.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeVineMossberg2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=LeVine |first1=Mark |last2=Mossberg|first2=Mathias|title=One Land, Two States: Israel and Palestine as Parallel States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnVAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211|year=2014|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-95840-1|page=211|quote=The parents of Zionism were not Judaism and tradition, but antiSemitism and nationalism.

This was helped along by the wave of [[pogrom]]s in Eastern Europe that set two million Jews to flight; most wound up in [[United States|America]], but some chose Palestine.

As we have seen, Zionism itself arose in reaction to anti-Semitic and exclusionary nationalist movements in Europe. It would be perverse to judge Zionism as somehow less valid than European anti-Semitism or those nationalisms. Furthermore, Zionism itself was also defined by its opposition to the indigenous Palestinian inhabitants of the region.

Until 1948, the primary goals of Zionism were the re-establishment of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel, [[gathering of Israel|ingathering of the exiles]], and liberation of Jews from the antisemitic discrimination and [[Persecution of Jews|persecution]] that they experienced during their [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]]. Since the establishment of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948, Zionism continues primarily to advocate on behalf of Israel and to address threats to its continued existence and security.

A religious variety of Zionism supports Jews upholding their Jewish identity defined as adherence to religious Judaism, opposes the assimilation of Jews into other societies, and has advocated the [[Aliyah|return]] of Jews to [[Israel]] as a means for Jews to be a majority nation in their own state.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=604.}} A variety of Zionism, called [[cultural Zionism]], founded and represented most prominently by [[Ahad Ha'am]], fostered a [[secular]] vision of a Jewish "spiritual center" in Israel. Unlike Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, Ahad Ha'am strived for Israel to be "a Jewish state and not merely a state of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;Ahad Ha'am, ''The Jewish State and Jewish Problem'', trans. from the Hebrew by Leon Simon c 1912, Jewish Publication Society of America, Essential Texts of Zionism [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/haam2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "Zionism" is derived from the word Zion ({{lang-he|ציון}} ,''Tzi-yon''), referring to [[Jerusalem]]. Throughout eastern Europe in the late 19th century, numerous grassroots groups were promoting the national resettlement of the Jews in their homeland, as well as the revitalization and cultivation of the Hebrew language. These groups were collectively called the "[[Lovers of Zion]]" and were seen to encounter a growing Jewish movement toward assimilation. The first use of the term is attributed to the Austrian [[Nathan Birnbaum]], founder of the ''Kadimah'' nationalist Jewish students' movement; he used the term in 1890 in his journal ''Selbstemanzipation!'' (''Self-Emancipation''),&lt;ref&gt;De Lange, Nicholas, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D7qPcsAFPvkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=An%20Introduction%20to%20Judaism%2C%20Cambridge%20University%20Press%20(2000)&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q=Birnbaum&amp;f=false ''An Introduction to Judaism''], Cambridge University Press (2000), p. 30. {{ISBN|0-521-46624-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; itself named almost identically to [[Leon Pinsker]]'s 1882 book ''[[Auto-Emancipation]]''.

==Overview==
{{Main|Types of Zionism}}
[[File:Israel_-_Location_Map_(2012)_-_ISR_-_UNOCHA.svg|thumb|The modern state of Israel, the end goal of the Zionist movement.]]
The common denominator among all Zionists is the claim to [[Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]] as the national homeland of the Jews and as the legitimate focus for Jewish national self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Shimoni, ''The Zionist Ideology'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on historical ties and [[Judaism|religious traditions]] linking the Jewish people to the [[Land of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aviel Roshwald]], "Jewish Identity and the Paradox of Nationalism", in [[Michael Berkowitz]], (ed.). ''Nationalism, Zionism and Ethnic Mobilization of the Jews in 1900 and Beyond'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Zionism does not have a uniform ideology, but has evolved in a dialogue among a plethora of ideologies: General Zionism, [[Religious Zionism]], [[Labor Zionism]], [[Revisionist Zionism]], [[Green Zionism]], etc.

After almost two millennia of the [[Jewish diaspora]] residing in various countries without a national state, the Zionist movement was founded in the late 19th century by [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jews]], largely as a response by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] to rising antisemitism in [[Europe]], exemplified by the [[Dreyfus affair]] in [[France]] and the [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Wylen, Stephen M. ''Settings of Silver: An Introduction to Judaism'', Second Edition, Paulist Press, 2000, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; The political movement was formally established by the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] journalist [[Theodor Herzl]] in 1897 following the publication of his book ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' (''The Jewish State'').&lt;ref&gt;Walter Laqueur, ''The History of Zionism'' (2003) p 40&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the movement sought to encourage Jewish migration to [[Ottoman Palestine]].

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote= "I believe that a wondrous generation of Jews will spring into existence. The Maccabeans will rise again. Let me repeat once more my opening words: The Jews who wish for a State will have it. We shall live at last as free men on our own soil, and die peacefully in our own homes. The world will be freed by our liberty, enriched by our wealth, magnified by our greatness. And whatever we attempt there to accomplish for our own welfare, will react powerfully and beneficially for the good of humanity."|source=Theodore Herzl, concluding words of ''The Jewish State'', 1896&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish State'', by Theodore Herzl, (Courier Corporation, 27 Apr 2012), page 157&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Although initially one of several Jewish political movements offering alternative responses to [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] and antisemitism, Zionism expanded rapidly. In its early stages, supporters considered setting up a Jewish state in the historic territory of Palestine. After [[World War II]] and the destruction of Jewish life in Central and Eastern Europe where these alternative movements were rooted, it became dominant in the thinking about a Jewish national state.

Creating an alliance with [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and securing support for some years for Jewish emigration to Palestine, Zionists also recruited European Jews to immigrate there, especially Jews who lived in areas of the Russian Empire where anti-semitism was raging. The alliance with Britain was strained as the latter realized the implications of the Jewish movement for Arabs in Palestine, but the Zionists persisted. The movement was eventually successful in establishing Israel on May 14, 1948 (5 Iyyar 5708 in the [[Hebrew calendar]]), as the [[homeland for the Jewish people]]. The proportion of the world's Jews living in Israel has steadily grown since the movement emerged. By the early 21st century, more than 40% of the [[Jewish population|world's Jews]] lived in Israel, more than in any other country. These two outcomes represent the historical success of Zionism, and are unmatched by any other Jewish political movement in the past 2,000 years. In some academic studies, Zionism has been analyzed both within the larger context of [[diaspora politics]] and as an example of modern [[Wars of national liberation|national liberation movements]].&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Taylor, "Vision and intent in Zionist Thought", in ''The Transformation of Palestine'', ed. by I. Abu-Lughod, 1971, {{ISBN|0-8101-0345-1}}, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Zionism also sought assimilation of Jews into the modern world. As a result of the diaspora, many of the Jewish people remained outsiders within their adopted countries and became detached from modern ideas. So-called "assimilationist" Jews desired complete integration into European society. They were willing to downplay their Jewish identity and in some cases to abandon traditional views and opinions in an attempt at modernization and assimilation into the modern world. A less extreme form of assimilation was called cultural synthesis. Those in favor of cultural synthesis desired continuity and only moderate evolution, and were concerned that Jews should not lose their identity as a people. "Cultural synthesists" emphasized both a need to maintain traditional Jewish values and faith, and a need to conform to a modernist society, for instance, in complying with work days and rules.&lt;ref&gt;Tesler, Mark. ''Jewish History and the Emergence of Modern Political Zionism.'' Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Printing Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed [[Resolution 3379]], which designated Zionism as "a form of racism and racial discrimination". The resolution was repealed in 1991 by replacing Resolution 3379 with [[United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379#Revocation|Resolution 46/86]]. Opposition to Zionism in principle has also sometimes been called racist and has been characterized as fostering the segregation of peoples that should seek peaceful coexistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/columnists/90023/why-anti-zionists-are-racists | title = Why anti-Zionists are racists | work= Jewish Chronicle | date=November 8, 2012|  accessdate= June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/opinion/article/formula_could_combat_campus_racism_20050610 | title = Formula Could Combat Campus Racism | work= Jewish Weekly | date=June 5, 2005|  accessdate= June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zionism was established with the political goal of creating a Jewish state in order to create a nation where Jews could be the majority, rather than the minority which they were in a variety of nations in the diaspora. [[Theodor Herzl]], the ideological father of Zionism, considered [[Antisemitism]] to be an eternal feature of all societies in which Jews lived as minorities, and that only a separation could allow Jews to escape [[Persecution of Jews|eternal persecution]]. "Let them give us sovereignty over a piece of the Earth's surface, just sufficient for the needs of our people, then we will do the rest!" he proclaimed exposing his plan.&lt;ref name="Herzl_Judenstaat"/&gt; {{rp|p.27 (29)}}

Herzl proposed two possible destinations to colonize, Argentina and Palestine. He preferred Argentina for its vast and sparsely populated territory and temperate climate, but conceded that Palestine would have greater attraction because of the historic ties of Jews with that area.&lt;ref name="Herzl_Judenstaat"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/freimann/content/pageview/938004 |title=Der Judenstaat |chapter=Palästina oder Argentinien?|page=29 (31)|first=Theodor |last=Herzl |language=German|publisher=sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de |year=1896 |accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also accepted to evaluate [[Joseph Chamberlain#Zionism and the "Uganda Proposal"|Joseph Chamberlain]]'s proposal for possible Jewish settlement in Great Britain's East African colonies.&lt;ref name="Tessler_1994"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kbU4BIAcrQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false
|first=Mark A. |last=Tessler |title=A History of the Israeli–Palestinian Conflict |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1994 |quote=The suggestion that Uganda might be suitable for Jewish colonization was first put forward by Joseph Chamberlain, the British colonial secretary, who said that he had thought about Herzl during a recent visit to the interior of British East Africa. Herzl, who at that time had been discussing with the British a scheme for Jewish settlement in Sinai, responded positively to Chamberlain's proposal, in part because of a desire to deepen Zionist-British cooperaion and, more generally to show that his diplomatic efforts were capable of bearing fruit. |access-date=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.55–56}}

Aliyah (migration, literally "ascent") to the Land of Israel is a recurring theme in Jewish prayers. [[Negation of the Diaspora|Rejection of life in the Diaspora]] is a central assumption in Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;E. Schweid, "Rejection of the Diaspora in Zionist Thought", in ''Essential Papers on Zionism'', ed. By Reinharz &amp; Shapira, 1996, {{ISBN|0-8147-7449-0}}, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of Zionism believed that Jews in the Diaspora were prevented from their full growth in Jewish individual and national life.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Zionists generally preferred to speak Hebrew, a [[Semitic language]] that developed under conditions of freedom in ancient [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], and worked to modernize and adapt it for everyday use. Zionists sometimes refused to speak [[Yiddish]], a language they thought had developed in the context of [[Antisemitism in Europe|European persecution]]. Once they moved to Israel, many Zionists refused to speak their (diasporic) mother tongues and adopted new, Hebrew names. Hebrew was preferred not only for ideological reasons, but also because it allowed all citizens of the new state to have a common language, thus furthering the political and cultural bonds among Zionists.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Major aspects of the Zionist idea are represented in the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]]:

{{Quote|The Land of Israel was the birthplace of the Jewish people. Here their spiritual, religious and political identity was shaped. Here they first attained to statehood, created cultural values of national and universal significance and gave to the world the eternal Book of Books.

After being forcibly exiled from their land, the people kept faith with it throughout their Dispersion and never ceased to pray and hope for their return to it and for the restoration in it of their political freedom.

Impelled by this historic and traditional attachment, Jews strove in every successive generation to re-establish themselves in their ancient homeland. In recent decades they returned in their masses.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, J.

Since the first centuries of the [[Common Era|CE]], most Jews have lived outside the Land of Israel (Eretz Israel, better known as Palestine), although there has been a constant minority presence of Jews.

The Bar Kokhba revolt caused a spike in [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and Jewish persecution. The ensuing exile from Judea greatly increased the percent of Jews who were dispersed throughout the Diaspora instead of living in their original home.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the 17th century [[Sabbatai Zevi]] (1626–1676) announced himself as the Messiah and gained many Jews to his side, forming a base in Salonika. He first tried to establish a settlement in Gaza, but moved later to [[Smyrna]]. After deposing the old rabbi [[Aaron Lapapa]] in the spring of 1666, the Jewish community of [[Avignon]], France prepared to emigrate to the new kingdom. The readiness of the Jews of the time to believe the messianic claims of Sabbatai Zevi may be largely explained by the desperate state of Central European Jewry in the mid-17th century. The bloody pogroms of [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] had wiped out one-third of the Jewish population and destroyed many centers of Jewish learning and communal life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'', Shabbethai Zebi, http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=531&amp;letter=S&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, a current in Judaism supporting a [[return to Zion]] grew in popularity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/churchhistory/0,15478,3900-1,00.html#FlashPluginDetected "Church History"], LDS Official website&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in Europe, where antisemitism and hostility toward Jews were growing. The idea of returning to Palestine was rejected by the conferences of rabbis held in that epoch. Individual efforts supported the emigration of groups of Jews to Palestine, [[Aliyah#Pre-Zionist Aliyah|pre-Zionist Aliyah]], even before [[First Zionist Congress|1897]], the year considered as the start of practical Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;C.D. Smith, 2001, ''Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict'', 4th ed., {{ISBN|0-312-20828-6}}, p. 1–12, 33–38&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reformed Jews rejected this idea of a return to Zion. The conference of rabbis, at [[Frankfurt am Main]], July 15–28, 1845, deleted from the ritual all prayers for a return to Zion and a restoration of a Jewish state. The Philadelphia Conference, 1869, followed the lead of the German rabbis and decreed that the Messianic hope of Israel is "the union of all the children of God in the confession of the unity of God". The Pittsburgh Conference, 1885, reiterated this Messianic idea of reformed Judaism, expressing in a resolution that "we consider ourselves no longer a nation, but a religious community; and we therefore expect neither a return to Palestine, nor a sacrificial worship under the sons of Aaron, nor the restoration of any of the laws concerning a Jewish state".&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia,'' "Zionism," http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=132&amp;letter=Z&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish settlements were established in the upper Mississippi region by W.D. Robinson in 1819. Others were developed near [[Jerusalem]] in 1850, by the American Consul [[Warder Cresson]], a convert to Judaism. Cresson was tried and condemned for lunacy in a suit filed by his wife and son. They asserted that only a lunatic would convert to Judaism from Christianity. After a second trial, based on the centrality of American 'freedom of faith' issues and antisemitism, Cresson won the bitterly contested suit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.com/93mag/usa-warder/usa-warder.htm], ''Jewish Mag''&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to Ottoman Palestine and established an agricultural colony in the [[Valley of Rephaim]] of Jerusalem. He hoped to "prevent any attempts being made to take advantage of the necessities of our poor brethren&amp;nbsp;... (that would)&amp;nbsp;... FORCE them into a pretended conversion."&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Virtual Library, "Warder Cresson," https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Cresson.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral but not practical efforts were made in [[Prague]] to organize a Jewish emigration, by [[Abraham Benisch]] and [[Moritz Steinschneider]] in 1835.

Sir [[Moses Montefiore]], famous for his intervention in favor of Jews around the world, including the attempt to rescue [[Edgardo Mortara]], established a colony for Jews in Palestine. In 1854, his friend [[Judah Touro]] bequeathed money to fund Jewish residential settlement in Palestine. Montefiore was appointed executor of his will, and used the funds for a variety of projects, including building in 1860 the first Jewish residential settlement and almshouse outside of the old walled city of Jerusalem—today known as ''[[Mishkenot Sha'ananim]].'' [[Laurence Oliphant (author)|Laurence Oliphant]] failed in a like attempt to bring to Palestine the Jewish proletariat of Poland, Lithuania, Romania, and the Turkish Empire (1879 and 1882).

The official beginning of the construction of the [[New Yishuv]] in Palestine is usually dated to the arrival of the [[Bilu]] group in 1882, who commenced the [[First Aliyah]]. In the following years, Jewish immigration to Palestine started in earnest. Most [[Jewish refugees|immigrants]] came from the Russian Empire, escaping the frequent [[pogrom]]s and state-led persecution in what are now Ukraine and Poland. They founded a number of agricultural settlements with financial support from Jewish philanthropists in Western Europe. Additional Aliyahs followed the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] and its eruption of violent pogroms, as well as the Nazi persecution of the 1930s. At the end of the 19th century, Jews were a small minority in Palestine.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the 1890s, [[Theodor Herzl]] infused Zionism with a new ideology and practical urgency, leading to the [[First Zionist Congress]] at [[Basel]] in 1897, which created the World Zionist Organization (WZO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fusion.dalmatech.com/%7Eadmin24/files/zionism_in-britishpalestine.pdf Zionism &amp; The British In Palestine]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127070858/http://fusion.dalmatech.com/~admin24/files/zionism_in-britishpalestine.pdf |date=November 27, 2007 }}, by [[Arjun Charan Sethi|Sethi, Arjun]] (University of Maryland) January 2007, accessed May 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Herzl's [[First Zionist Congress#Basel program|aim]] was to initiate necessary preparatory steps for the development of a Jewish state. Herzl's attempts to reach a political agreement with the Ottoman rulers of Palestine were unsuccessful and he sought the support of other governments. The WZO supported small-scale settlement in Palestine; it focused on strengthening Jewish feeling and consciousness and on building a worldwide federation.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[Russian Empire]], with its long record of state-organized genocide and ethnic cleansing ("pogroms"), was widely regarded as the historic enemy of the Jewish people. The Zionist movement's headquarters were located in Berlin, as many of its leaders were German Jews who spoke German. Given Russia's anti-semitism, at the start of World War I, most Jews (and Zionists) supported Germany in its war with Russia.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Territories considered===
{{Main|Jewish territorialism|Proposals for a Jewish state}}
Throughout the first decade of the Zionist movement, there were several instances where Zionist figures supported a Jewish state in places outside Palestine, such as [[Uganda Scheme|Uganda]] and [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="Rovner2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Rovner|title=In the Shadow of Zion: Promised Lands Before Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej_UBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|date=December 12, 2014|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-1-4798-1748-1|page=45|quote=European Jews swayed and prayed for Zion for nearly two millennia, and by the end of the nineteenth century their descendants had transformed liturgical longing into a political movement to create a Jewish national entity somewhere in the world.

It took nearly a decade for Zionism to exdusively concentrate its spiritual yearning on the spatial coordinates of Ottoman Palestine.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Theodor Herzl]], the founder of political Zionism was initially content with any Jewish self-governed state.&lt;ref name="AvivShneer2005a"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Caryn S.

In 1903, British Colonial Secretary [[Joseph Chamberlain]] offered Herzl 5,000 square miles in the [[Uganda Protectorate]] for Jewish settlement.&lt;ref name="PasachoffLittman2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Naomi E.

Some groups felt that accepting the scheme would make it more difficult to establish a Jewish state in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], the African land was described as an "[[Antechamber|ante-chamber]] to the Holy Land". It was decided to send a commission to investigate the proposed land by 295 to 177 votes, with 132 abstaining. The following year, congress sent a delegation to inspect the plateau. A temperate climate due to its high elevation, was thought to be suitable for European settlement. However, the area was populated by a large number of [[Maasai people|Maasai]], who did not seem to favour an influx of Europeans. Furthermore, the delegation found it to be filled with [[lion]]s and other animals.

After Herzl died in 1904, the Congress decided on the fourth day of its seventh session in July 1905 to decline the British offer and, according to Adam Rovner, "direct all future settlement efforts solely to Palestine".&lt;ref name="PasachoffLittman2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rovner2014n2"/&gt; [[Israel Zangwill]]'s [[Jewish Territorialist Organization]] aimed for a Jewish state anywhere, having been established in 1903 in response to the Uganda Scheme, was supported by a number of the Congress's delegates. Following the vote, which had been proposed by [[Max Nordau]], Zangwill charged Nordau that he “will be charged before the bar of history,” and his supporters blamed the Russian voting bloc of [[Menachem Ussishkin]] for the outcome of the vote.&lt;ref name="Rovner2014n2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Rovner|title=In the Shadow of Zion: Promised Lands Before Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej_UBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|date=December 12, 2014|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-1-4798-1748-1|page=81|quote=On the afternoon of the fourth day of the Congress a weary Nordau brought three resolutions before the delegates: (1) that the Zionist Organization direct all future settlement efforts solely to Palestine; (2) that the Zionist Organization thank the British government for its other of an autonomous territory in East Africa; and (3) that only those Jews who declare their allegiance to the Basel Program may become members of the Zionist Organization." Zangwill objected… When Nordau insisted on the Congress’s right to pass the resolutions regardless, Zangwill was outraged. “You will be charged before the bar of history,” he challenged Nordau… From approximately 1:30 p.m. on Sunday, July 30, 1905, a Zionist would henceforth he defined as someone who adhered to the Basel Program and the only “authentic interpretation” of that program restricted settlement activity exclusively to Palestine. Zangwill and his supporters could not accept Nordau’s “authentic interpretation" which they believed would lead to an abandonment of the Jewish masses and of Herzl’s vision. One territorialist claimed that Ussishkin’s voting bloc had in fact “buried political Zionism”.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balfour Declaration and the Palestine Mandate===
{{main|Balfour Declaration|British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)}}
[[File:Palestine claimed by WZO 1919.png|thumb|right|Palestine as claimed by the World Zionist Organization in 1919 at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]]]
Lobbying by Russian Jewish immigrant [[Chaim Weizmann]] together with fear that [[American Jews]] would encourage the USA to support Germany in the war against communist Russia, culminated in the British government's [[Balfour Declaration]] of 1917. &lt;!--Explain - how was this a result?--&gt;

It endorsed the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, as follows:
{{quote|His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author-link=Malcolm Yapp| last=Yapp| first=M.E.| title=The Making of the Modern Near East 1792-1923| date=September 1, 1987| publisher=Longman| location=Harlow, England| isbn=978-0-582-49380-3| page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1922, the [[League of Nations]] adopted the declaration, and granted to Britain the Palestine Mandate:

{{quote|The Mandate will secure the establishment of the Jewish national home ... and the development of self-governing institutions, and also safeguard the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine, irrespective of race and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateofisrael.com/mandate|title=League of Nations Palestine Mandate: July 24, 1922|website=www.stateofisrael.com|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Weizmann's role in obtaining the Balfour Declaration led to his election as the Zionist movement's leader. He remained in that role until 1948, and then was elected as the first [[President of Israel]] after the nation gained independence.

A number of high-level representatives of the international Jewish women's community participated in the [[First World Congress of Jewish Women]], which was held in [[Vienna]], Austria, in May 1923. One of the main resolutions was: "It appears ... to be the duty of all Jews to co-operate in the social-economic reconstruction of Palestine and to assist in the settlement of Jews in that country."&lt;ref name=jwa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/international-council-of-jewish-women|title=International Council of Jewish Women|author=Las, Nelly|publisher=International Council of Jewish Women|accessdate=20 November 2018 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish migration to Palestine and widespread Jewish land purchases from feudal{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} landlords contributed to landlessness among Palestinian Arabs, fueling unrest. Riots erupted in Palestine in [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920]], [[Jaffa riots|1921]] and [[1929 Palestine riots|1929]], in which both Jews and Arabs were killed.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/middle_east/03/v3_ip_timeline/html/1929_36.stm |title=Arab discontent |publisher=BBC |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain was responsible for the Palestinian mandate and, after the Balfour Declaration, it supported Jewish immigration in principle. But, in response to the violent events noted above, the [[Peel Commission]] published a report proposing new provisions and restrictions in Palestine.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1927, [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Judaism|Jew]] [[Yitzhak Lamdan]], wrote an [[epic poem]] titled ''Masada'' to reflect the plight of the Jews, calling for a "last stand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamdan|first1=Yitzhak|title=Masada|date=1927|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the German adoption of the [[swastika]], [[Theodore N. Kaufman|Theodore Newman Kaufman]], bent on provoking a race war and eliminating his perception of "[[inbreeding|inbred]] Germanism", published ''[[Germany Must Perish!]]'' [[Anti-German sentiment|Anti-German]] articles, such as the ''[[Daily Express]]'' calling for an "[[Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933|Anti-Nazi boycott]]", in response to German [[antisemitism]] were published prior to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise, as well. This has given birth to the [[conspiracy theory]] that [[Holocaust denial|Jews started the holocaust]], although the Nazi Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] was largely responsible for ignoring the patriotic Jew, and for instead promoting anti-German materials as "evidence" that the Jews needed to be eradicated.

===Rise of Hitler===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
In 1933, [[Hitler]] came to power in Germany, and in 1935 the [[Nuremberg Laws]] made [[German Jews]] (and later [[Anschluss|Austrian]] and [[Czech Jews]]) stateless refugees. Similar rules were applied by the many [[Axis powers|Nazi allies]] in Europe. The subsequent growth in Jewish migration and the impact of [[Nazi propaganda]] aimed at the Arab world led to the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]]. Britain established the Peel Commission to investigate the situation. The commission did not consider the situation of Jews in Europe, but called for a two-state solution and compulsory [[Population transfer|transfer of populations]]. Britain rejected this solution and instead implemented the [[White Paper of 1939]]. This planned to end Jewish immigration by 1944 and to allow no more than 75,000 additional Jewish migrants. This was disastrous to European Jews already being gravely discriminated against and in need of a place to seek refuge. The British maintained this policy until the end of the Mandate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The growth of the Jewish community in Palestine and the devastation of European Jewish life sidelined the World Zionist Organization. The Jewish Agency for Palestine under the leadership of [[David Ben-Gurion]] increasingly dictated policy with support from American Zionists who provided funding and influence in Washington, D.C., including via the highly effective [[American Palestine Committee]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[File:Declaration of State of Israel 1948 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Ben-Gurion]] proclaiming Israel's independence beneath a large portrait of Theodor Herzl]]
During [[World War II]], as the horrors of [[the Holocaust]] became known, the Zionist leadership formulated the [[One Million Plan]], a reduction from Ben-Gurion's previous target of two million immigrants. Following the end of the war, a massive wave of [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|stateless Jews]], mainly [[Holocaust survivors]], began [[Aliyah Bet|migrating to Palestine]] in small boats in defiance of British rules. The Holocaust united much of the rest of world Jewry behind the Zionist project.&lt;ref name=miracle&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Paul|title=The Miracle|journal=Commentary|date=May 1998|volume=105|pages=21–28|accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British either [[Cyprus internment camps|imprisoned these Jews in Cyprus]] or [[sS Exodus|sent them]] to the British-controlled [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany]]. The British, having faced the 1936–1939 Arab revolt against mass Jewish immigration into Palestine, were now facing opposition by [[British–Zionist conflict|Zionist groups in Palestine]] for subsequent restrictions. In January 1946 the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry was a joint [[United Kingdom–United States relations|British and American]] committee set up to examine the political, economic and social conditions in Palestine as they bore upon the problem of Jewish immigration and settlement and the well-being of the peoples living there; to consult representatives of Arabs and Jews, and to make other recommendations 'as necessary' for ad interim handling of these problems as well as for their eventual solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/angpre.asp Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry - Preface].

With the German invasion of Russia in 1941, Stalin reversed his long-standing opposition to Zionism, and tried to mobilize worldwide Jewish support for the Soviet war effort.  A  Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee was set up in Moscow. Many thousands of Jewish refugees fled the Nazis and entered the Soviet Union during the war, where they reinvigorated Jewish religious activities and opened new synagogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hiroaki Kuromiya|title=Stalin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRV4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1947 Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister [[Andrei Gromyko]] told the United Nations that the USSR supported the partition of Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.

''Journal of Israeli History'' 22.1 (2003): 4-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine]] recommended that western Palestine should be partitioned into a Jewish state, an Arab state and a [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|UN-controlled territory, ''Corpus separatum'', around Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Special Committee on Palestine; report to the General Assembly, A/364, September 3, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; This [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partition plan]] was adopted on November 29, 1947 with UN GA Resolution 181, 33 votes in favor, 13 against, and 10 abstentions.

Since the creation of the State of Israel, the World Zionist Organization has functioned mainly as an organization dedicated to assisting and encouraging Jews to migrate to Israel. It has provided political support for Israel in other countries but plays little role in internal Israeli politics. The movement's major success since 1948 was in providing logistical support for migrating Jews and, most importantly, in assisting [[Soviet Jews]] in their struggle with the authorities over the right to leave the [[USSR]] and to practice their religion in freedom, and the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands|exodus of 850,000 Jews]] from the Arab world, mostly to Israel. In 1944–45, Ben-Gurion described the [[One Million Plan]] to foreign officials as being the "primary goal and top priority of the Zionist movement."{{sfn|Hacohen|1991|p=262 #2|ps=:"In meetings with foreign officials at the end of 1944 and during 1945, Ben-Gurion cited the plan to enable one million refugees to enter Palestine immediately as the primary goal and top priority of the Zionist movement.}} The immigration restrictions of the British White Paper of 1939 meant that such a plan could not be put into large scale effect until the Israeli Declaration of Independence in May 1948. The new country's immigration policy had some opposition within the new Israeli government, such as those who argued that there was "no justification for organizing large-scale emigration among Jews whose lives were not in danger, particularly when the desire and motivation were not their own"{{sfn|Hakohen|2003|p=46|ps=: "After independence, the government presented the Knesset with a plan to double the Jewish population within four years. This meant bringing in 600,000 immigrants in a four-year period. or 150,000 per year. Absorbing 150,000 newcomers annually under the trying conditions facing the new state was a heavy burden indeed. Opponents in the Jewish Agency and the government of mass immigration argued that there was no justification for organizing large-scale emigration among Jews whose lives were not in danger, particularly when the desire and motivation were not their own."}} as well as those who argued that the absorption process caused "undue hardship".{{sfn|Hakohen|2003|p=246–247|ps=: "Both the immigrants' dependence and the circumstances of their arrival shaped the attitude of the host society. The great wave of immigration in 1948 did not occur spontaneously: it was the result of a clear-cut foreign policy decision that taxed the country financially and necessitated a major organizational effort. Many absorption activists, Jewish Agency executives, and government officials opposed unlimited, nonselective immigration; they favored a gradual process geared to the country's absorptive capacity. Throughout this period, two charges resurfaced at every public debate: one, that the absorption process caused undue hardship; two, that Israel's immigration policy was misguided."}} However, the force of Ben-Gurion's influence and insistence ensured that his immigration policy was carried out.{{sfn|Hakohen|2003|p=47|ps=: "But as head of the government, entrusted with choosing the cabinet and steering its activities, Ben-Gurion had tremendous power over the country's social development. His prestige soared to new heights after the founding of the state and the impressive victory of the IDF in the War of Independence. As prime minister and minister of defense in Israel's first administration, as well as the uncontested leader of the country's largest political party, his opinions carried enormous weight. Thus, despite resistance from some of his cabinet members, he remained unflagging in his enthusiasm for unrestricted mass immigration and resolved to put this policy into effect."}}{{sfn|Hakohen|2003|p=247|ps=: "On several occasions, resolutions were passed to limit immigration from European and Arab countries alike. However, these limits were never put into practice, mainly due to the opposition of Ben-Gurion. As a driving force in the emergency of the state, Ben-Gurion—both prime minister and minister of defense—carried enormous weight with his veto. His insistence on the right of every Jew to immigrate proved victorious. He would not allow himself to be swayed by financial or other considerations. It was he who orchestrated the large-scale action that enabled the Jews to leave Eastern Europe and Islamic countries, and it was he who effectively forged Israel's foreign policy. Through a series of clandestine activities carried out overseas by the Foreign Office, the Jewish Agency, the Mossad le-Aliyah, and the Joint Distribution Committee, the road was paved for mass immigration."}}

The multi-national, worldwide Zionist [[Philosophical movement|movement]] is structured on [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] principles. Congresses are held every four years (they were held every two years before the Second World War) and delegates to the congress are elected by the membership. Members are required to pay dues known as a ''shekel''. At the congress, delegates elect a 30-man executive council, which in turn elects the movement's leader. The movement was democratic from its inception and women had the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Living Without a Constitution: Civil Rights in Israel|last=Sharfman |first=Dafnah |date=1993 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOrHFmiQy6kC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;d&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LzJxz5RbFA&amp;sig=uKe6YPolMzwelcBNNK52ii_Os8o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AAdTVf3UIeL-7AbPnYGgDQ&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCTgo#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20voting&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1917, the [[World Zionist Organization]] pursued a strategy of building a [[Jewish National Home]] through persistent small-scale immigration and the founding of such bodies as the [[Jewish National Fund]] (1901&amp;nbsp;– a charity that bought land for Jewish settlement) and the [[Anglo-Palestine Bank]] (1903&amp;nbsp;– provided loans for Jewish businesses and farmers). In 1942, at the [[Biltmore Conference]], the movement included for the first time an express objective of the establishment of a Jewish state in the Land of Israel.&lt;ref name="ajcarchives.org"&gt;''American Jewish Year Book'' Vol. 45 (1943–1944) [http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1943_1944_5_USCivicPolitical.pdf Pro-Palestine and Zionist Activities, pp 206-214]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ingathering of the Jewish People in its historic homeland, Eretz Israel, through Aliyah from all countries
* Strengthening of the State of Israel, based on the prophetic vision of justice and peace
* Preservation of the identity of the Jewish People through fostering of Jewish and Hebrew education, and of Jewish spiritual and cultural values
* Protection of Jewish rights everywhere

Since the creation of modern Israel, the role of the movement has declined. It is now a peripheral factor in [[Israeli politics]], though different perceptions of Zionism continue to play roles in Israeli and Jewish political discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/History/Zionism/Pages/Zionist%20Philosophies.aspx|title=Zionist Philosophies| website=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labor Zionism originated in Eastern Europe. Socialist Zionists believed that centuries of oppression in antisemitic societies had reduced Jews to a meek, vulnerable, despairing existence that invited further antisemitism, a view originally stipulated by Theodor Herzl. They argued that a revolution of the Jewish soul and society was necessary and achievable in part by Jews moving to Israel and becoming farmers, workers, and soldiers in a country of their own. Most socialist Zionists rejected the observance of traditional religious Judaism as perpetuating a "Diaspora mentality" among the Jewish people, and established rural communes in Israel called "[[kibbutz]]im". The kibbutz began as a variation on a "national farm" scheme, a form of cooperative agriculture where the Jewish National Fund hired Jewish workers under trained supervision. The kibbutzim were a symbol of the Second Aliyah in that they put great emphasis on communalism and egalitarianism, representing to a certain extent Utopian socialism. Furthermore, they stressed self-sufficiency, which became an important aspect of Labor Zionism. Though socialist Zionism draws its inspiration and is philosophically founded on the fundamental values and spirituality of Judaism, its progressive expression of that Judaism has often fostered an antagonistic relationship with [[Orthodox Judaism]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Labor Zionism became the dominant force in the political and economic life of the [[Yishuv]] during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] and was the dominant ideology of the political establishment in Israel until the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 election]] when the [[Israeli Labor Party]] was defeated. The Israeli Labor Party continues the tradition, although the most popular party in the kibbutzim is [[Meretz]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, ''Israel: A History'' (London 1997), pp.594–607&lt;/ref&gt; Labour Zionism's main institution is the [[Histadrut]] (general organisation of labor unions), which began by providing strikebreakers against a Palestinian worker's strike in 1920 and until 1970s was the largest employer in Israel after the Israeli government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Guy Mundlak|title=Fading Corporatism: Israel's Labor Law and Industrial Relations in Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhxJ4DX4rEsC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dr&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cXNGFdGssM&amp;sig=uMkeHoiWSimlIWgf2j3LHK8-KpY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NzhTVcGxDInXUeeOgdAF&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%20second%20largest%20employer&amp;f=false|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=44|isbn=978-0-8014-4600-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mishmar HaEmek.JPG|thumb|Kibbutznikiyot (female Kibbutz members) in [[Mishmar HaEmek]], during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The [[Kibbutz]] is the historical heartland of Labor Zionism.]]
General Zionism (or Liberal Zionism) was initially the dominant trend within the Zionist movement from the First Zionist Congress in 1897 until after the First World War. General Zionists identified with the liberal European middle class to which many Zionist leaders such as Herzl and [[Chaim Weizmann]] aspired. Liberal Zionism, although not associated with any single party in modern Israel, remains a strong trend in Israeli politics advocating free market principles, democracy and adherence to human rights. [[Kadima]], the main centrist party during the 2000s that is now defunct, however, did identify with many of the fundamental policies of Liberal Zionist ideology, advocating among other things the need for Palestinian statehood in order to form a more democratic society in Israel, affirming the free market, and calling for equal rights for Arab citizens of Israel. In 2013, [[Ari Shavit]] suggested that the success of the then-new [[Yesh Atid]] party (representing secular, middle-class interests) embodied the success of "the new General Zionists."&lt;ref&gt;Ari Shavit, [http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/the-dramatic-headline-of-this-election-israel-is-not-right-wing.premium-1.496021 The dramatic headline of this election: Israel is not right wing] ''Haaretz'' (January 24, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dror Zeigerman]] writes that the traditional positions of the General Zionists—"liberal positions based on social justice, on law and order, on pluralism in matters of State and Religion, and on moderation and flexibility in the domain of foreign policy and security"—are still favored by important circles and currents within certain active political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fnst-jerusalem.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/dror_book.pdf |title=A Liberal Upheaval: From the General Zionists to the Liberal Party (pre-book dissertation) |author=Dror Zeigerman |publisher=Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Liberty |date=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402102632/http://www.fnst-jerusalem.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/dror_book.pdf |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Carlo Strenger]] describes a modern-day version of Liberal Zionism (supporting his vision of "Knowledge-Nation Israel"), rooted in the original ideology of Herzl and [[Ahad Ha'am]], that stands in contrast to both the [[romantic nationalism]] of the right and the ''Netzah Yisrael'' of the ultra-Orthodox. It is marked by a concern for democratic values and human rights, freedom to criticize government policies without accusations of disloyalty, and rejection of excessive religious influence in public life. "Liberal Zionism celebrates the most authentic traits of the Jewish tradition: the willingness for incisive debate; the contrarian spirit of ''davka''; the refusal to bow to authoritarianism."&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Strenger, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/liberal-zionism-1.292270 Liberal Zionism] ''Haaretz'' (May 26, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Strenger, [http://azure.org.il/download/magazine/Az39%20Strenger.pdf Knowledge-Nation Israel: A New Unifying Vision], ''[[Azure (magazine)|Azure]]'' Winter 2010, No. 39, pp. 35-57&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal Zionists see that "Jewish history shows that Jews need and are entitled to a nation-state of their own. But they also think that this state must be a [[liberal democracy]], which means that there must be strict equality before the law independent of religion, ethnicity or gender."&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Strenger, [http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/strenger-than-fiction/.premium-1.578511 Israel today: a society without a center] ''Haaretz'' (March 7, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revisionist Zionism===
{{Main|Revisionist Zionism}}
[[File:Zeev Jabotinsky.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], founder of Revisionist Zionism]]
Revisionist Zionists, led by [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], developed what became known as Nationalist Zionism, whose guiding principles were outlined in the 1923 essay ''[[Iron Wall (essay)|Iron Wall]]''. In 1935 the Revisionists left the World Zionist Organization because it refused to state that the creation of a Jewish state was an objective of Zionism.

Jabotinsky believed that, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Zionism is a colonising adventure and it therefore stands or falls by the question of armed force. It is important to build, it is important to speak Hebrew, but, unfortunately, it is even more important to be able to shoot—or else I am through with playing at colonization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lenni Brenner]], ''The Iron Wall: Zionist Revisionism from Jabotinsky to Shamir'', Zed Books 1984, pp.74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]], ''Original Sins: Reflections on the History of Zionism and Israel'', Olive Branch Press, 1993 p.103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and that
&lt;blockquote&gt;Although the Jews originated in the East, they belonged to the West culturally, morally, and spiritually. Zionism was conceived by Jabotinsky not as the return of the Jews to their spiritual homeland but as an offshoot or implant of Western civilization in the East. This worldview translated into a geostrategic conception in which Zionism was to be permanently allied with European colonialism against all the Arabs in the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="shlaim"&gt;{{cite web|author=Avi Shlaim |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/shlaim-wall.html |title=The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World since 1948 |publisher=New York Times |date=1999 |accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The revisionists advocated the formation of a Jewish Army in Palestine to force the Arab population to accept mass Jewish migration.

Supporters of Revisionist Zionism developed the [[Likud]] Party in Israel, which has dominated most governments since 1977. It advocates Israel's maintaining control of the [[West Bank]], including [[East Jerusalem]], and takes a hard-line approach in the Arab–Israeli conflict. In 2005, the Likud split over the issue of creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories. Party members advocating peace talks helped form the Kadima Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Vause |author2=Guy Raz |author3=Shira Medding |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/11/21/israel.politics/ |title=Sharon shakes up Israeli politics |date=November 22, 2005 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Religious Zionism}}
Religious Zionism is an ideology that combines Zionism and observant [[Judaism]]. Before the establishment of [[Israel|the State of Israel]], Religious Zionists were mainly observant Jews who supported Zionist efforts to build a [[Jewish state]] in the [[Land of Israel]].

After the [[Six-Day War]] and the capture of the [[West Bank]], a territory referred to in Jewish terms as [[Judea and Samaria]], right-wing components of the Religious Zionist movement integrated nationalist revindication and evolved into [[Neo-Zionism]]. Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel and the Torah of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Kemp, ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314–315.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Green Zionism}}
Green Zionism is a branch of Zionism primarily concerned with the environment of Israel. The only environmental Zionist party is the [[Green Zionist Alliance]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Post-Zionism===
During the last quarter of the 20th century, classic nationalism in Israel declined. This led to the rise of [[post-Zionism]]. Post-Zionism asserts that Israel should abandon the concept of a "state of the Jewish people" and strive to be a state of all its citizens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/article/469 Can Israel Survive Post-Zionism?] by Meyrav Wurmser. ''Middle East Quarterly'', March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[One-state solution|binational state]] where Arabs and Jews live together while enjoying some type of autonomy.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Non-Jewish support==
Political support for the Jewish return to the Land of Israel predates the formal organization of Jewish Zionism as a political movement. In the 19th century, advocates of the [[restoration of the Jews to the Holy Land]] were called Restorationists. The return of the Jews to the Holy Land was widely supported by such eminent figures as [[Queen Victoria]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/herzl-hinted-at-napoleon-s-zionist-past-1.120723|title=Herzl Hinted at Napoleon's Zionist Past'|first=Amiram|last=Barkat|date=April 26, 2004|publisher=|accessdate=March 12, 2018|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[King Edward VII]], President [[John Adams]] of the United States, [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]] of South Africa, [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|President Masaryk]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], philosopher and historian [[Benedetto Croce]] from Italy, [[Henry Dunant]] (founder of the [[Red Cross]] and author of the [[Geneva Conventions]]), and scientist and humanitarian [[Fridtjof Nansen]] from [[Norway]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The French government, through Minister M. Cambon, formally committed itself to "...&amp;nbsp;the renaissance of the Jewish nationality in that Land from which the people of Israel were exiled so many centuries ago."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In China, top figures of the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist government]], including [[Sun Yat-sen]], expressed their sympathy with the aspirations of the Jewish people for a National Home.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Goldstein |first=Jonathan |year=1999 |contribution=The Republic of China and Israel |editor-last=Goldstein |editor-first=Jonathan |title=China and Israel, 1948–1998: A Fifty Year Retrospective |pages=1–39 |place=Westport, Conn. and London |publisher=Praeger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians have actively supported the return of Jews to Palestine even prior to the rise of Zionism, as well as subsequently.  [[Anita Shapira]], a history professor emerita at Tel Aviv University, suggests that evangelical Christian restorationists of the 1840s 'passed this notion on to Jewish circles'.&lt;ref name="shapira"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Shapira | first = Anita | title = Israel a history | publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicolson| location = London | page = 15 | date = 2014 | isbn =9780297871583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelical Christian anticipation of and political lobbying within the UK for [[Christian Zionism in the United Kingdom|Restorationism]] was widespread in the 1820s and common beforehand.&lt;ref name= Lewis&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Donald | title = The Origins of Christian Zionism: Lord Shaftesbury And Evangelical Support For A Jewish Homeland | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = January 2, 2014 | location = Cambridge | page = 380 | isbn =9781107631960}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was common among the [[Puritan]]s to anticipate and frequently to pray for a Jewish return to their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Murray | first = Iain | title = the Puritan Hope | publisher = Banner of Truth | date = October 2014 | location = Edinburgh | page = 326 | isbn =9781848714786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cwi.org.uk/library/articles/HAPH.htm | title = The Puritan Hope and Jewish Evangelism | work= Herald Magazine, Christian Witness to Israel | date= 2015|  accessdate=June 29, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160629204443/http://www.cwi.org.uk/library/articles/HAPH.htm | archive-date= June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://americanvision.org/1715/john-macarthur-israel-calvinism-postmillennialism-part-2/ | title = John MacArthur, Israel, Calvinism, and Postmillennialism | work= American Vision | date=July 3, 2007|  accessdate=June 29, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160629204142/http://americanvision.org/1715/john-macarthur-israel-calvinism-postmillennialism-part-2/ | archive-date= June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the principal [[Protestantism|Protestant]] teachers who promoted the biblical doctrine that the Jews would return to their national homeland was [[John Nelson Darby]]. His doctrine of [[dispensationalism]] is credited with promoting Zionism, following his 11 lectures on the hopes of the church, the Jew and the [[gentile]] given in Geneva in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sizer | first = Stephen

Pro-Zionist views were embraced by many [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]] and also affected international foreign policy.

The [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] ideologue [[Hippolytus Lutostansky]], also known as the author of multiple [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] tracts, insisted in 1911 that Russian Jews should be "helped" to move to Palestine "as their rightful place is in their former kingdom of Palestine".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Herman Bernstein|url = https://newspaperarchive.com/us/new-york/new-york/new-york-times/1911/08-27/page-42|title = Ritual murder libel encouraged by Russian court|last = |first = |date = August 27, 1911|work = New York Times|access-date = |via = |publication-date = August 27, 1911|quote = "Russia would make any sacrifice to help the Jews settle in Palestine and form an autonomous state of their own"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable early supporters of Zionism include British Prime Ministers [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Arthur Balfour]], American President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and British [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Orde Wingate]], whose activities in support of Zionism led the British Army to ban him from ever serving in Palestine. According to Charles Merkley of Carleton University, Christian Zionism strengthened significantly after the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, and many dispensationalist and non-dispensationalist evangelical Christians, especially Christians in the United States, now strongly support Zionism.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the last years of his life, the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], [[Joseph Smith]], declared, "the time for Jews to return to the land of Israel is now." In 1842, Smith sent [[Orson Hyde]], an Apostle of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], to Jerusalem to dedicate the land for the return of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/Jews/jewsch6.htm |title=Orson Hyde and Israel's Restoration |publisher=Signaturebookslibrary.org |accessdate=June 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707015147/http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/Jews/jewsch6.htm |archivedate=July 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Palestine Mandate era, [[As'ad Shukeiri]], a Muslim scholar ('alim) of the Acre area, and the father of [[PLO]] founder [[Ahmad Shukeiri]], rejected the values of the Palestinian Arab national movement and was opposed to the anti-Zionist movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East'', Volume 4, Reeva S.

Macmillan Reference USA, 1996. p. 1661&lt;/ref&gt; He met routinely with Zionist officials and had a part in every pro-Zionist Arab organization from the beginning of the British Mandate, publicly rejecting [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]]'s use of [[Islam]] to attack Zionism.&lt;ref name="shadows1"&gt;''Army of Shadows: Palestinian Collaboration with Zionism, 1917–1948''.

Some [[Indian Muslims]] have also expressed opposition to [[Islam and anti-Zionism|Islamic anti-Zionism]]. In August 2007, a delegation of the All India Organization of [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|Imams]] and mosques led by its president Maulana Jamil Ilyas visited Israel. The meeting led to a joint statement expressing "peace and goodwill from Indian Muslims", developing dialogue between Indian Muslims and Israeli Jews, and rejecting the perception that the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] is of a religious nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianmuslims.info/news/2007/aug/15/american_jewish_group_takes_indian_muslims_israel.html American Jewish group takes Indian Muslims to Israel | Indian Muslims] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430145743/http://www.indianmuslims.info/news/2007/aug/15/american_jewish_group_takes_indian_muslims_israel.html |date=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The visit was organized by the [[American Jewish Committee]]. The purpose of the visit was to promote meaningful debate about the status of Israel in the eyes of Muslims worldwide, and to strengthen the relationship between India and Israel. It is suggested that the visit could "open Muslim minds across the world to understand the democratic nature of the state of Israel, especially in the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/dialogue-democracy-indian-muslims-visit-israel|title=Dialogue of Democracy: Indian Muslims Visit Israel - YaleGlobal Online|website=yaleglobal.yale.edu|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu support for Zionism===
{{Main|India–Israel relations|Hindu Nationalism}}
After Israel's creation in 1948, the [[Indian National Congress]] government opposed Zionism. Some writers have claimed that this was done in order to get more Muslim votes in India (where Muslims numbered over 30 million at the time).&lt;ref name="kap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/papers2/paper131.html|title=India&amp;nbsp;— Israel Relations: The Imperatives for Enhanced Strategic Cooperation&amp;nbsp;— Subhash Kapila |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211233957/http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/papers2/paper131.html |archive-date=February 11, 2010 |publisher=[[South Asia Analysis Group]]|website=southasiaanalysis.org|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, conservative Hindu nationalists, led by the [[Sangh Parivar]], openly supported Zionism, as did Hindu Nationalist intellectuals like [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]] and [[Sita Ram Goel]].&lt;ref name="Hindu pro-Zionism"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/9680428/Hindu-ProZionism-and-PhiloSemitism |title=Hindu Pro-Zionism and Philo-Semitism |publisher=Scribd |date=December 30, 2008 |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zionism, seen as a national liberation movement for the repatriation of the Jewish people to their homeland then under British colonial rule, appealed to many [[Hindu Nationalist]]s, who viewed their struggle for [[Indian Independence Movement|independence from British rule]] and the [[Partition of India]] as national liberation for [[Persecution of Hindus|long-oppressed]] Hindus.

Zionism is opposed by a wide variety of organizations and individuals. Among those opposing Zionism are some secular Jews,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; some branches of Judaism ([[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar Hasidim]] and  [[Neturei Karta]]), the former [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://encycl.yandex.ru/art.xml?art=bse/00071/37300.htm&amp;encpage=bse&amp;mrkp=http://hghltd.yandex.com/yandbtm?url=http://encycl.yandex.ru/texts/bse/00071/37300.htm&amp;text=�������&amp;reqtext=�������::781659&amp;&amp;isu=2 Сионизм]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Большая советская энциклопедия (Zionism. [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd Edition. 1969–1978)&lt;/ref&gt; many in the [[Muslim world]], and Palestinians. Reasons for opposing Zionism are varied, and they include: the perception that land confiscations are unfair; expulsions of Palestinians; violence against Palestinians; and alleged [[racism]]. Arab states in particular strongly oppose Zionism, which they believe is responsible for the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]]. The preamble of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], which has been ratified by 53 African countries {{As of|2014|lc=y}}, includes an undertaking to eliminate Zionism together with other practices including [[colonialism]], [[neo-colonialism]], [[apartheid]], "aggressive foreign military bases" and all forms of [[discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/instruments/achpr/|title=African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights / Legal Instruments / ACHPR|website=www.achpr.org|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achpr.org/instruments/achpr/ratification/ Ratification Table: African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights], African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Zionism was also opposed for other reasons by some Jews even before the establishment of the state of Israel because "Zionism constitutes a danger, both spiritual and physical, to the existence of our people".&lt;ref&gt;"Holocaust Victims Accuse" by Reb. Moshe Shonfeld; Bnei Yeshivos NY, NY; (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1945 US President [[Franklin D Roosevelt]] met with king [[Ibn Saud]] of Saudi Arabia. Ibn Saud pointed out that it was Germany who had committed crimes against the Jews and so Germany should be punished. Palestinian Arabs had done no harm to European Jews and did not deserve to be punished by losing their land. Roosevelt on return to the US concluded that Israel 'could only be established and maintained by force', and that it would have to be a 'land for Jews only'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexei Mikhailovich Vasiliev|Alexei Vasiliev]], ''A History of Saudi Arabia'', Saqi, chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic Church and Zionism===
{{Main|Holy See–Israel relations|Supersessionism#Roman Catholicism|Christianity and antisemitism}}
The initial response of the [[Catholic Church]] seemed to be one of strong opposition to Zionism. Shortly after the 1897 Basel Conference, the semi-official Vatican periodical (edited by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]) [[Civiltà Cattolica]] gave its biblical-theological judgement on political Zionism: "1827 years have passed since the prediction of Jesus of Nazareth was fulfilled&amp;nbsp;... that [after the destruction of Jerusalem] the Jews would be led away to be slaves among all the nations and that they would remain in the dispersion [diaspora, galut] until the end of the world." The Jews should not be permitted to return to Palestine with sovereignty: "According to the Sacred Scriptures, the Jewish people must always live dispersed and vagabondo [vagrant, wandering] among the other nations, so that they may render witness to Christ not only by the Scriptures&amp;nbsp;... but by their very existence".

Nonetheless, Theodore Herzl travelled to Rome in late January 1904, after the sixth Zionist Congress (August 1903) and six months before his death, looking for some kind of support. On January 22, Herzl first met the Papal Secretary of State, Cardinal [[Rafael Merry del Val]]. According to Herzl's private diary notes, the Cardinal's interpretation of the history of Israel was the same as that of the Catholic Church, but he also asked for the conversion of the Jews to Catholicism. Three days later, Herzl met Pope [[Pius X]], who replied to his request of support for a Jewish return to Israel in the same terms, saying that "we are unable to favor this movement. We cannot prevent the Jews from going to Jerusalem, but we could never sanction it&amp;nbsp;... The Jews have not recognized our Lord, therefore we cannot recognize the Jewish people."  In 1922, the same periodical published a piece by its Viennese correspondent, "anti-Semitism is nothing but the absolutely necessary and natural reaction to the Jews' arrogance... Catholic anti-Semitism - while never going beyond the moral law - adopts all necessary means to emancipate the Christian people from the abuse they suffer from their sworn enemy".&lt;ref name= Kertzer&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kertzer | first = David | title = Civiltà cattolica, 1922, IV, pp.369-71, cited in Unholy War | publisher = Pan Books | location = London | page = 273 | date = 2001 | isbn= 9780330390491}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initial attitude changed over the next 50 years, until 1997, when at the [[Holy See|Vatican]] symposium of that year, Pope [[John Paul II]] rejected the Christian roots of antisemitism, stating that "...&amp;nbsp;the wrong and unjust interpretations of the New Testament relating to the Jewish people and their supposed guilt [in Christ's death] circulated for too long, engendering sentiments of hostility toward this people."&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Thomas F. Stransky, Paulist.

===Characterization as colonialism or ethnic cleansing===
Zionism has been characterized as colonialism, and Zionism has been criticized for promoting unfair confiscation of land, involving the expulsion of, and causing violence towards, the Palestinians. The characterization of Zionism as colonialism has been described by, among others, [[Nur Masalha]], Gershon Shafir, [[Michael Prior (theologian)|Michael Prior]], [[Ilan Pappe]], and  [[Baruch Kimmerling]].&lt;ref name=CHARCOL&gt;

Others, such as [[Shlomo Avineri]] and [[Mitchell Bard]], view Zionism not as colonialist movement, but as a national movement that is contending with the Palestinian one.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Isaac Deutscher]] has called Israelis the 'Prussians of the Middle East', who have achieved a 'totsieg', a 'victorious rush into the grave' as a result of dispossessing 1.5 million Palestinians. Israel had become the 'last remaining colonial power' of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tariq Ali]], ''The Clash of Fundamentalisms: Crusades, Jihad and Modernity'', Verso, 2003, p 124&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Said]] and [[Michael Prior (theologian)|Michael Prior]] claim that the notion of expelling the Palestinians was an early component of Zionism, citing Herzl's diary from 1895 which states "we shall endeavour to expel the poor population across the border unnoticed—the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly."&lt;ref&gt;

:".. the Zionist movement, which claims to be secular, found it necessary to embrace the idea of 'the promised land' of Old Testament prophecy, to justify the confiscation of land and the expulsion of the Palestinians. For example, the speeches and letter of Chaim Weizman, the secular Zionist leader, are filled with references to the biblical origins of the Jewish claim to Palestine, which he often mixes liberally with more pragmatic and nationalistic claims. By the use of this premise, embraced in 1937, Zionists alleged that the Palestinians were usurpers in the Promised Land, and therefore their expulsion and death was justified. The Jewish-American writer Dan Kurzman, in his book ''Genesis 1948'' … describes the view of one of the Deir Yassin's killers: 'The Sternists followed the instructions of the Bible more rigidly than others. They honored the passage (Exodus 22:2): 'If a thief be found …' This meant, of course, that killing a thief was not really murder. And were not the enemies of Zionism thieves, who wanted to steal from the Jews what God had granted them?'"

In 1938, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] rejected Zionism, saying that the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine is a religious act and therefore must not be performed by force, comparing it to the [[Partition of India]] into Hindu and Muslim countries. He wrote, "Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs&amp;nbsp;... Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home&amp;nbsp;... They can settle in Palestine only by the goodwill of the Arabs. They should seek to convert the Arab heart."&lt;ref&gt;William R. Slomanson.

Ha'am wrote that the Zionists "behave towards the Arabs with hostility and cruelty, trespass unjustly upon their boundaries, beat them shamefully without reason and even brag about it, and nobody stands to check this contemptible and dangerous tendency" and that they believed that "the only language that the Arabs understand is that of force."&lt;ref name=LRB&gt;{{cite journal|last=shlaim|first=Avi|title=It can be done|journal=[[London Review of Books]]|date=June 9, 1994|volume=16|issue=11|pages=26–27|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v16/n11/avi-shlaim/it-can-be-done|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some criticisms of Zionism claim that Judaism's notion of the "[[Jews as a chosen people|chosen people]]" is the source of racism in Zionism,&lt;ref&gt;

Thus, Yakov Malik, the Soviet ambassador to the UN, declared in 1973: “The Zionists have come forward with the theory of the Chosen People, an absurd ideology.” (As it is well known, the biblical concept of “Chosen People” is part of Judaism; Zionism has nothing to do with it).

In 1975 the [[UN General Assembly]] passed Resolution 3379, which said "Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination". According to the resolution, "any doctrine of racial differentiation of superiority is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust, and dangerous." The resolution named the occupied territory of Palestine, Zimbabwe, and South Africa as examples of racist regimes. Resolution 3379 was pioneered by the Soviet Union and passed with numerical support from Arab and African states amidst accusations that Israel was supportive of the apartheid regime in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/un/un-general-assembly-resolution-3379-racial-discrimination/p11284 UN General Assembly Resolution 3379, Racial Discrimination (Council on Foreign Relations, November 10, 1975)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130141738/http://www.cfr.org/un/un-general-assembly-resolution-3379-racial-discrimination/p11284 |date=January 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was robustly criticised by the US representative, [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] as an 'obscenity' and a 'harm ... done to the United Nations'.&lt;ref name="moyn"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Troy | first = Gil | title = Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | page = 368 | date = 2012 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_8VqP7QKPA | isbn =9780196360331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'In 1991 the resolution was repealed with [[UN General Assembly Resolution 46/86]],&lt;ref name="mfa.gov.il"&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1988-1992/260%20General%20Assembly%20Resolution%2046-86-%20Revocation 260 General Assembly Resolution 46-86- Revocation of Resolution 3379- December 16, 1991&amp;nbsp;— and statement by President Herzog Dec 16, 1991, VOLUME 11–12: 1988–1992] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603181644/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1988-1992/260%20General%20Assembly%20Resolution%2046-86-%20Revocation |date=June 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after Israel declared that it would only participate in the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]] if the resolution were revoked.&lt;ref&gt;Frum, David (2000).

Arab countries sought to associate Zionism with racism in connection with a [[World Conference against Racism 2001|2001 UN conference on racism]], which took place in [[Durban]], South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1484002.stm|title=Anger over Zionism debate|date=September 4, 2001|publisher=|accessdate=March 12, 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which caused the United States and Israel to walk away from the conference as a response. The final text of the conference did not connect Zionism with racism. A human rights forum arranged in connection with the conference, on the other hand, did equate Zionism with racism and censured Israel for what it called "racist crimes, including acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1523600.stm|title=US abandons racism summit|date=September 3, 2001|publisher=|accessdate=March 12, 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of Zionism, such as [[Chaim Herzog]], argue that the movement is non-discriminatory and contains no racist aspects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/herzogsp.html Israeli Ambassador Chaim Herzog's Response To Zionism Is Racism Resolution. November 10, 1975.] "You dare talk of racism when I can point with pride to the Arab ministers who have served in my government; to the Arab deputy speaker of my Parliament; to Arab officers and men serving of their own volition in our border and police defense forces, frequently commanding Jewish troops; to the hundreds of thousands of Arabs from all over the Middle East crowding the cities of Israel every year; to the thousands of Arabs from all over the Middle East coming for medical treatment to Israel; to the peaceful coexistence which has developed; to the fact that Arabic is an official language in Israel on a par with Hebrew; to the fact that it is as natural for an Arab to serve in public office in Israel as it is incongruous to think of a Jew serving in any public office in an Arab country, indeed being admitted to many of them. Is that racism? It is not! That, Mr. President, is Zionism."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haredi Judaism and Zionism===
{{See also|Haredim and Zionism}}
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
Many Haredi Orthodox organizations oppose Zionism; they view Zionism as a secular movement. They reject nationalism as a doctrine and consider Judaism to be first and foremost a religion that is not dependent on a state. However, some Haredi movements (such as [[Shas]] since 2010) do openly affiliate with the Zionist movement.

Haredi rabbis do not consider Israel to be a [[halacha|halachic]] Jewish state because it has secular government. But they take responsibility for ensuring that Jews maintain religious ideals and, since most Israeli citizens are Jews, they pursue this agenda within Israel. Others reject any possibility of a Jewish state, since according to them a Jewish state is completely forbidden by Jewish religious law. In their view a Jewish state is considered an oxymoron.

Two Haredi parties run candidates in Israeli elections. They are sometimes associated with views that could be regarded as nationalist or Zionist. They prefer coalitions with more nationalist Zionist parties, probably because these are more interested in enhancing the Jewish nature of the Israeli state. The Sephardi-Orthodox party [[Shas]] rejected association with the Zionist movement; however, in 2010 it joined the [[World Zionist Organization]]. Its voters generally identify as Zionist, and Knesset members frequently pursue what others might consider a Zionist agenda. Shas has supported territorial compromise with the Arabs and Palestinians, but it generally opposes compromise over Jewish holy sites.

The non-Hasidic or 'Lithuanian' Haredi Ashkenazi world is represented by the Ashkenazi [[Agudat Israel]]/[[United Torah Judaism|UTJ]] party. It has always avoided association with the Zionist movement and usually avoids voting on or discussing issues related to peace, because its members do not serve in the army. The party works to ensure that Israel and Israeli law are in tune with the halacha, on issues such as [[Shabbat]] rest. The rabbinical leaders of the so-called [[Litvishe]] world in current and past generations, such as Rabbi [[Elazar Menachem Shach]] and Rabbi [[Avigdor Miller]], are strongly opposed to all forms of Zionism, religious and secular. But they allow members to participate in Israeli political life, including both passive and active participation in elections.

Many other [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] groups in Jerusalem, most famously the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Hasidim, as well as the larger movement they are part of, the [[Edah HaChareidis]], are strongly anti-Zionist. One of the best known Hasidic opponents of all forms of modern political Zionism was [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[rebbe]] and [[Talmud]]ic scholar [[Joel Teitelbaum]]. In his view, the current State of Israel is contrariwise to Judaism, because it was [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|founded]] by people who included some anti-religious personalities, and were in apparent violation of the traditional notion that Jews should wait for the Jewish Messiah.

Teitelbaum referred to core citations from classical Judaic sources in his arguments against modern Zionism; specifically a passage in the Talmud, in which Rabbi Yosi b'Rebbi Hanina explains (Kesubos 111a) that the Lord imposed "[[Three Oaths]]" on the nation of Israel: a) Israel should not return to the Land together, by force; b) Israel should not rebel against the other nations; and c) The nations should not subjugate Israel too harshly. According to Teitelbaum, the second oath is relevant concerning the subsequent wars fought between Israel and Arab nations.

Other opponent groups among the Edah HaChareidis were [[Dushinsky (Hasidic dynasty)|Dushinsky]], [[Toldos Aharon]], [[Toldos Avrohom Yitzchok]], [[Spinka]], and others. They number in the tens of thousands in Jerusalem, and hundreds of thousands worldwide.

To avoid accusations of antisemitism, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] has historically avoided using the word "Jewish" in favor of using "Zionist," though PLO officials have sometimes slipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3PNt46aB_sYC&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Native vs. Settler |author-last=Mitchell |author-first=Thomas G. |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2000 |page=48 |quote=To most Arabs the terms Jew or Jewish and Zionist are interchangeable.

For public relations purposes the PLO has never wanted to be accused of being anti-Semitic but rather only of being anti-Zionist. Occasionally its leaders slip, as Arafat did when he referred to the "Jewish invasion" in his speech.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some antisemites have alleged that Zionism was, or is, part of a Jewish plot to take control of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Cohn]], [[Warrant for Genocide]], Serif 2001 chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; One particular version of these allegations, "[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]" (subtitle "Protocols extracted from the secret archives of the central chancery of Zion") achieved global notability. The protocols are fictional minutes of an imaginary meeting by Jewish leaders of this plot. Analysis and proof of their fraudulent origin goes as far back as 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/hoax.html|title=A Hoax of Hate|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1920 German version renamed them "[[The Zionist Protocols]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Cohn]], [[Warrant for Genocide]], Serif 2001 page 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; The protocols were [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion#toc|extensively used as propaganda]] by the Nazis and remain widely [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion#Modern era|distributed in the Arab world]]. They are referred to in the 1988 [[Hamas#Hamas Charter (1988)|Hamas charter]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamas charter, article 32: "The Zionist plan is limitless. After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates. When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on. Their plan is embodied in the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion"&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt;

There are examples of anti-Zionists using accusations, slanders, imagery and tactics previously associated with antisemites. On October 21, 1973, the then-Soviet ambassador to the United Nations [[Yakov Malik]] declared: "The Zionists have come forth with the theory of the [[Chosen People]], an absurd ideology."  Similarly, an exhibit about Zionism and Israel in the former Museum of Religion and Atheism in [[Saint Petersburg]] designated the following as Soviet Zionist material: Jewish [[tallit|prayer shawls]], ''[[tefillin]]'' and [[Passover]]'' [[Hagaddah]]s'',&lt;ref&gt;[[William Korey|Korey, W.]], "Updating the Protocols," ''Midstream'', May 1970, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; even though these are all ''religious'' items used by Jews for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="Why?"&gt;[[Dennis Prager|Prager, D]]; [[Joseph Telushkin|Telushkin, J]]. ''Why the Jews?: The Reason for Antisemitism''. New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1983. page 169-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, anti-Zionist writers such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Norman Finkelstein]], [[Michael Marder]], and [[Tariq Ali]] have argued that the characterization of anti-Zionism as antisemitic is inaccurate, that it sometimes obscures legitimate [[criticism of Israel]]'s policies and actions, and that it is sometimes used as a political ploy in order to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel.

* Professor [[Noam Chomsky]] argues: "There have long been efforts to identify anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism in an effort to exploit anti-racist sentiment for political ends; "one of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the Gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not a distinction at all," Israeli diplomat Abba Eban argued, in a typical expression of this intellectually and morally disreputable position (Eban, Congress Bi-Weekly, March 30, 1973). But that no longer suffices. It is now necessary to identify criticism of Israeli policies as anti-Semitism&amp;nbsp;— or in the case of Jews, as "self-hatred," so that all possible cases are covered."&amp;nbsp;— Chomsky, 1989 "Necessary Illusions".
* Philosopher Michael Marder argues: "To deconstruct Zionism is ... to demand justice for its victims - not only for the Palestinians, who are suffering from it, but also for the anti-Zionist Jews, "erased" from the officially consecrated account of Zionist history. By deconstructing its ideology, we shed light on the context it strives to repress and on the violence it legitimises with a mix of theological or metaphysical reasoning and affective appeals to historical guilt for the undeniably horrific persecution of Jewish people in Europe and elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/12/here-why-deconstructing-zionism-important-201312863538927197.html|title=Here is why deconstructing Zionism is important|first=Michael|last=Marder|website=www.aljazeera.com|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Zionism-Metaphysics-Contemporary-Philosophy/dp/1441105948/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383853271|title=Deconstructing Zionism: A Critique of Political Metaphysics|editor-first1=Gianni|editor-last1=Vattimo|editor-first2=Michael|editor-last2=Marder|date=November 21, 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|accessdate=March 12, 2018|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* American political scientist Norman Finkelstein argues that anti-Zionism and often just criticism of Israeli policies have been conflated with antisemitism, sometimes called [[new antisemitism]] for political gain: "Whenever Israel faces a public relations débâcle such as the Intifada or international pressure to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict, American Jewish organizations orchestrate this extravaganza called the 'new anti-Semitism.' The purpose is several-fold. First, it is to discredit any charges by claiming the person is an anti-Semite. It's to turn Jews into the victims, so that the victims are not the Palestinians any longer. As people like Abraham Foxman of the ADL put it, the Jews are being threatened by a new holocaust. It's a role reversal&amp;nbsp;— the Jews are now the victims, not the Palestinians. So it serves the function of discrediting the people leveling the charge. It's no longer Israel that needs to leave the Occupied Territories; it's the Arabs who need to free themselves of the anti-Semitism.&amp;nbsp;— &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Tariq Ali, a British-Pakistani historian and political activist, argues that the concept of new antisemitism amounts to an attempt to subvert the language in the interests of the State of Israel. He writes that the campaign against "the supposed new 'anti-semitism'" in modern Europe is a "cynical ploy on the part of the Israeli Government to seal off the Zionist state from any criticism of its regular and consistent brutality against the Palestinians&amp;nbsp;... Criticism of Israel can not and should not be equated with anti-semitism." He argues that most pro-Palestinian, anti-Zionist groups that emerged after the Six-Day War were careful to observe the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism. —&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Tariq.

==Marcus Garvey and Black Zionism==
{{See also|Alliance of Black Jews|Back-to-Africa movement}}
Zionist success in winning British support for the formation of a Jewish National Home in Palestine helped inspire the Jamaican [[Black nationalism|Black nationalist]] [[Marcus Garvey]] to form a movement dedicated to returning Americans of African origin to [[Africa]]. During a speech in [[Harlem]] in 1920, Garvey stated: "other races were engaged in seeing their cause through—the Jews through their Zionist movement and the Irish through their Irish movement—and I decided that, cost what it might, I would make this a favorable time to see the Negro's interest through."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Negro World]]'' March 6, 1920, cited in [http://www.international.ucla.edu/africa/mgpp/lifeintr.asp University of California, Los Angeles] (accessed November 29, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Garvey established a shipping company, the [[Black Star Line]], to allow Black Americans to emigrate to Africa, but for various reasons he failed in his endeavour.

Garvey helped inspire the [[Rastafari movement]] in Jamaica, the [[Beth Shalom B'nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation|Black Jews]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackjews.org/RabbiBios/RabbiFord.html BlackJews.org&amp;nbsp;— A Project of the International Board of Rabbis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030055447/http://www.blackjews.org/RabbiBios/RabbiFord.html |date=October 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem]] who initially moved to [[Liberia]] before settling in Israel.
