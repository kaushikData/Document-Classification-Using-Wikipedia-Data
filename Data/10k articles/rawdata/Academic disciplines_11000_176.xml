'''A-not-B error''' (also known as "stage 4 error" or "perseverative error") is a phenomenon uncovered by the work of [[Jean Piaget]] in his [[theory of cognitive development]] of children. The A-not-B error is a particular error made by infants during substage 4 of their [[sensorimotor stage]]. 

A typical A-not-B task goes like this: An experimenter hides an attractive toy under box "A" within the baby's reach. The baby searches for the toy, looks under box "A", and finds the toy. This activity is usually repeated several times (always with the researcher hiding the toy under box "A"). Then, in the critical trial, the experimenter moves the toy under box "B", also within easy reach of the baby. Babies of 10 months or younger typically make the [[perseveration]] error, meaning they look under box "A" even though they saw the researcher move the toy under box "B", and box "B" is just as easy to reach. This demonstrates a lack of, or incomplete, [[schema (psychology)|schema]] of [[object permanence]]. Children of 12 months or older typically do not make this error.

==Competing explanations==
Traditionally, this phenomenon has been explained as the child seeing an image and remembering where it was, rather than where it is. Other accounts deal with the development of planning, reaching, and deciding things. There are also [[behaviorist]] accounts that explain the behavior in terms of reinforcement. This account argues that the repeated trials with hiding the toy in box "A" is reinforcing that specific behavior, so that the child still reaches for box "A" because the action has been reinforced before. However, this account does not explain the shift in behavior that occurs around 12 months.

Smith and Thelen&lt;ref name=ST&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00156-6|pmid=12907229|title=Development as a dynamic system|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=8|pages=343–348|year=2003|last1=Smith|first1=Linda B.|last2=Thelen|first2=Esther}}&lt;/ref&gt; used a [[Cognitive model#Cognitive development| dynamic systems]] approach to the A-not-B task. They found that various components of the activity (strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time, stance) combine in the "B"-trial (where the object is hidden in the "B" location rather than "A") so the child either correctly or incorrectly searches for the toy. They experimentally manipulated the task to see if they could make 10-month-old babies (who typically make the perseverative error of searching at "A") perform like 12-month-old babies (who typically search correctly). Changing the stance of the baby (sitting or standing) was one manipulation they found could make the 10-month-old search correctly. Just standing instead of sitting for the "B"-trial made the prior experience of searching in location "A" less salient to the child, who then searched correctly. The researchers concluded that the length of wait time was one of the crucial elements of the task that is influenced by age.

The '''[[articular capsule]] of the [[knee joint]]''' (commonly referred to as '''capsular [[ligament]]''') is wide and lax; thin in front and at the side; and contains the [[patella]] ("knee cap"), [[ligament]]s, [[meniscus (anatomy)|menisci]], and [[synovial bursa|bursa]]e.&lt;ref name="Platzer-206"&gt;Platzer (2004), p 206&lt;/ref&gt;  The capsule consists of a [[synovial membrane|synovial]] and a [[collagen|fibrous membrane]] separated by fatty deposits anteriorly and posteriorly.&lt;ref name="Platzer-210"&gt;Platzer (2004), p 210&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synovial membrane ==
[[File:Knee-unfolding-recess-diagram.svg|thumb|left|Unfolding suprapatellar recess.]]
Anteriorly, the reflection of the synovial membrane lies on the [[femur]]; located at some distance from the cartilage because of the presence of the [[suprapatellar bursa]].  Above, the reflection appears lifted from the bone by underlying [[Periosteum|periosteal]] [[connective tissue]].&lt;ref name="Platzer-210" /&gt;  In a standing posture, the suprapatellar bursa is seemingly redundant.  It is however also referred to as the ''suprapatellar synovial recess'' as it gradually unfolds as the knee is flexed; to open up completely when the knee is flexed 130 degrees.&lt;ref name="Thieme-Atlas-400"&gt;''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'', pp 400-401&lt;/ref&gt;  The suprapatellar bursa is prevented from being pinched during extension by the [[articularis genus muscle]].&lt;ref name="Reider-etal"&gt;{{cite web |title=The anterior aspect of the knee joint |author1=B Reider |author2=JL Marshall |author3=B Koslin |author4=B Ring |author5=FG Girgis |publisher=J Bone Joint Surg Am. 1981;63:351-356. |url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/63/3/351.pdf | date=1981 |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the [[tibia]], the anterior reflection and attachment of the synovial membrane is located near the cartilage.&lt;ref name="Platzer-210" /&gt;

Anteriorly, the infrapatellar fat pad is inserted below the patella and between the two membranes.  It extends from the lower margin of the patella above, to the infrapatellar synovial fold below.  With its free upper margin, this fold extends dorsally through the joint space to surround the two cruciate ligaments from the front, thus dividing the surrounding joint space into two chambers.  Laterally of this are a pair of alar folds.&lt;ref name="Platzer-210" /&gt;

Posteriorly, the femoral attachment of the synovial membrane is located at the cartilaginous margin of the [[Lateral condyle of femur|lateral]] and [[Medial condyle of femur|medial femoral condyle]]s, why the joint space has two dorsal extensions.  Between these, the synovial membrane passes in front of the [[anterior cruciate ligament|anterior]] and [[posterior cruciate ligament]]s, why these ligaments are both intracapsular and extra-articular with their tibial attachment located exactly on the cartilage margin.  Both the [[lateral meniscus|lateral]] and [[medial meniscus]] are, however, located within the synovial capsule.&lt;ref name="Platzer-210" /&gt;

==Fibrous membrane==

It is a thin, but strong, fibrous membrane which is strengthened in almost its entire extent by bands inseparably connected with it.

Above and in front, beneath the tendon of the [[Quadriceps femoris]], it is represented only by the synovial membrane.

Its chief strengthening bands are derived from the [[fascia lata]] and from the [[tendon]]s surrounding the joint.

== Bursae ==
{{main|Bursae of the knee joint}}
The numerous bursae surrounding the knee joint can be divided into the ''communicating'' and the ''non-communicating'' bursae:&lt;ref name="Platzer-210" /&gt;
* Communicating bursae:
** The [[suprapatellar bursa]], the largest bursa, extends the joint space anteriorly and proximally.
** The [[subpopliteal recess]] and [[semimembranosus bursa]] are located posteriorly and are much smaller
** The [[Lateral subtendinous bursa of gastrocnemius|lateral]] and [[medial subtendinous bursa of gastrocnemius|medial subtendinous bursae of gastrocnemius]] are located at the origin of the two heads of the [[gastrocnemius muscle]].
* Non-communicating bursae:
** The [[subcutaneous prepatellar bursa]] is located in front of the patella.
** The [deep] [[infrapatellar bursa]] is located under the patella, between the patellar ligament and the fibrous membrane of the joint capsule.  It is communicating with the joint space in particular cases.
** Other less regularly present bursae include the [[subfascial prepatellar bursa|subfascial prepatellar]], the [[subtendinous prepatellar bursa|subtendinous prepatellar]], and the [[subcutaneous prepatellar bursa]]e.

Adding to the complex structure of the knee space, there are remnants of three embryonic [[Septum|septal]] divisions of the knee space called synovial plicae:&lt;ref name="Burgener-390"&gt;Burgener (2002), p 390&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''suprapatellar plica'' dividing the suprapatellar recess
* The ''infrapatellar plica'', in front of the [[anterior cruciate ligament]], reaches from the [[intercondylar notch]] to the infrapateller fat pad
* The ''medial patellar plica'', located adjacent to the patella's medial facet, runs vertically along the medial joint capsule

'''The Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology''' (ASHA) was founded as the Australian Society for Historical Archaeology in 1970 by [[Judy Birmingham]], then a lecturer at the [[University of Sydney]]. Its aims were, and still are, to promote the study of [[historical archaeology in Australia]].

==Origins==

The Australian Society for Historical Archaeology, came out of the developing interest in archaeology in Australia in the 1970s, and in particular the increasing interest generated by uncovering of Colonial period archaeology in [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]], [[Sydney Cove]], [[The Rocks, Sydney|The Rocks]] and other parts of [[New South Wales]], as well as the first historical archaeology course at the University of Sydney, in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Jack, Ian 2006  “Historical Archaeology, Heritage and the [[University of Sydney]]”, ''Australasian Historical Archaeology'' 24:19-24&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the society was extended to include [[New Zealand]] and the Asia-Pacific region generally, and its name was changed to the Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology. In the mid-1990s the Society's committee moved from being Sydney based to being a more Australasian wide committee (Neville Ritchie, the then president lived in New Zealand) reflecting the growth of historical archaeology in the region.

The society's activities include public lectures and an annual conference with papers presented by national and international speakers. It promotes the exchange of information and reference material relating to historical archaeology in Australia and overseas.

ASHA publishes the ''ASHA Newsletter'' and the journal ''Australasian Historical Archaeology'', (distributed free to members of the Society), as well as the ''Occasional Papers'' series and monographs. Initially ASHA published only a ''Newsletter'' which was important in conveying relevant news and information (often research findings). In 1983 the society began publishing the ''Australian Journal of Historical Archaeology'' under the editorship of [[Graham Connah]]. This provided the only venue for publishing the results of historical archaeological research in Australia. In 1981 the journal was renamed to reflect the contribution of New Zealand Historical Archaeology and became the ''Australasian Historical Archaeology'', and has remained the main journal in Australia for publication of research and excavation results from Historical Archaeological Projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informit.com.au/products/productdetails.aspx?id=1322-9214&amp;container=IELHSS RMIT, INFORMIT, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Collection Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first volume included 'A first bibliography of historical archaeology in Australia', which was subsequently updated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asha.org.au/australasian-historical-archaeology/ ''Australian Historical Archaeology''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830134127/http://www.asha.org.au/australasian-historical-archaeology/ |date=August 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been important in developing theory and practice in Historical Archaeology, with early analytical articles such as Graham Connah's  'Stamp-collecting or increasing understanding',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashadocs.org/aha/01/01_04_Connah.pdf Graham Connah, 'Stamp-collecting or increasing understanding: the dilema of Historical Archaeology', ''Australian Historical Archaeology'', 1, 1983, pp.15-21]&lt;/ref&gt; which he followed up with the answer in 1998 in 'Pattern and purpose in Historical Archaeology'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashadocs.org/aha/16/16_04_Connah.pdf Graham Connah, 'Pattern and purpose in Historical Archaeology' ''Australian Historical Archaeology'', No 6. 1998, pp.3-7]&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by Mackay and Karskers review of Connah's approasial, focusing on the ''...contribution of other forms of public archaeology in Australia in the
late twentieth century.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashadocs.org/aha/17/17_04_Mackay.pdf RICHARD MACKAY and GRACE KARSKENS, 'Historical Archaeology in Australia: Historical or Hysterical? Crisis or Creative Awakening?', ''Australasian Historical Archaeology'', 17, 1999, pp. 110-115]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian National Wildlife Collection''' ('''ANWC''') is a collection of almost 200,000 [[zoology|zoological]] [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s, including skeletons, skins, spirit specimens, birds’ eggs, frozen tissue samples and a wildlife sound library, mainly of [[vertebrate]] animals from [[Australia]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], which are stored in a secure, climate-controlled facility.  It is based at [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] Sustainable Ecosystems Division in the [[Australian Capital Territory]].

==History==
The ANWC was established in 1966, though its origins date from the late 1950s when scientists in the CSIRO’s Wildlife Survey section were collecting specimens in the course of their work and were concerned that their individual collections should not be dispersed and should be accessible at a central location for long-term security and so that comparative studies could be made.  The decision to establish a central facility was made by [[Harold James Frith|Harold Frith]], Chief of the Division of Wildlife.  The founding Curator, later Director, was [[Richard Schodde]], who held the post for nearly thirty years.  It was formally recognised and named the Australian National Wildlife Collection in 1976 through [[gazettal]] by the [[Government of Australia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8993">The '''Berry paradox''' is a [[self-referential]] [[paradox]] arising from an expression like "The smallest positive integer not definable in under sixty letters" (a phrase with fifty-seven letters). [[Bertrand Russell]], the first to discuss the paradox in print, attributed it to G. G. Berry (1867–1928),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Nicholas Griffin| title = The Cambridge Companion to Bertrand Russell| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=obY48lTt-2AC&amp;pg=PA63| date = 2003-06-23| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-63634-6| page = 63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a junior [[librarian]] at [[Oxford]]'s [[Bodleian library]].

== Overview ==
Consider the expression:

:"The smallest [[Positive number|positive]] [[integer]] not definable in under sixty letters."

Since there are only twenty-six letters in the English alphabet, there are finitely many phrases of under sixty letters, and hence finitely many positive integers that are defined by phrases of under sixty letters. Since there are infinitely many positive integers, this means that there are positive integers that cannot be defined by phrases of under sixty letters. If there are positive integers that satisfy a given property, then there is a ''smallest'' positive integer that satisfies that property; therefore, there is a smallest positive integer satisfying the property "not definable in under sixty letters". This is the integer to which the above expression refers. The above expression is only fifty-seven letters long, therefore it ''is'' definable in under sixty letters, and is ''not'' the smallest positive integer not definable in under sixty letters, and is ''not'' defined by this expression. This is a paradox: there must be an integer defined by this expression, but since the expression is self-contradictory (any integer it defines is definable in under sixty letters), there cannot be any integer defined by it.

Perhaps another helpful analogy to Berry's Paradox would be the phrase, "indescribable feeling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Menken|first1=Alan|last2=Ashman|first2=Howard|last3=Rice|first3=Tim|title=Aladdin (Piano/Vocal/Guitar Songbook)|date=1 Dec 1992|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0793517824}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the feeling is indeed indescribable, then no description of the feeling would be true.  But if the word "indescribable" communicates something about the feeling, then it may be considered a description: this is self-contradictory.

Mathematician and computer scientist Gregory J. Chaitin in ''The Unknowable'' (1999) adds this comment: "Well, the Mexican mathematical historian Alejandro Garcidiego has taken the trouble to find that letter [of Berry's from which Russell penned his remarks], and it is rather a different paradox. Berry’s letter actually talks about the first ordinal that can’t be named in a finite number of words. According, to Cantor’s theory such an ordinal must exist, but we’ve just named it in a finite number of words, which is a contradiction."

== Resolution ==
{{Confusing|section|date=December 2015}}

The Berry paradox as formulated above arises because of systematic [[ambiguity]] in the word "definable". In other formulations of the Berry paradox, such as one that instead reads: "...not [[name]]able in less..." the term "nameable" is also one that has this systematic ambiguity. Terms of this kind give rise to [[vicious circle principle|vicious circle]] fallacies. Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal.&lt;ref&gt;Russell and Whitehead (1927).&lt;/ref&gt; To resolve one of these paradoxes means to pinpoint exactly where our use of language went wrong and to provide restrictions on the use of language which may avoid them.

This family of paradoxes can be resolved by incorporating stratifications of meaning in language. Terms with systematic ambiguity may be written with subscripts denoting that one level of meaning is considered a higher priority than another in their interpretation. "The number not nameable&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in less than eleven words" may be nameable&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in less than eleven words under this scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard Quine|Quine, Willard]] (1976). ''Ways of Paradox''. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal analogues ==

Using programs or proofs of bounded lengths, it is possible to construct an analogue of the Berry expression in a formal mathematical language, as has been done by [[Gregory Chaitin]].  Though the formal analogue does not lead to a logical contradiction, it does prove  certain impossibility results.

[[George Boolos]] (1989) built on a formalized version of Berry's paradox to prove [[Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem]] in a new and much simpler way. The basic idea of his proof is that a [[proposition]] that holds of ''x'' if and only if ''x'' = ''n'' for some natural number ''n'' can be called a ''definition'' for ''n'', and that the set {(''n'', ''k''): ''n'' has a definition that is ''k'' symbols long} can be shown to be representable (using [[Gödel number]]s). Then the proposition "''m'' is the first number not definable in less than ''k'' symbols" can be formalized and shown to be a definition in the sense just stated.

==Relationship with Kolmogorov complexity==
{{main | Kolmogorov complexity}}

It is not possible in general to unambiguously define what is the minimal number of symbols required to describe a given string (given a specific description mechanism). In this context, the terms ''string'' and ''number'' may be used interchangeably, since a number is actually a string of symbols, e.g. an English word (like the word "eleven" used in the paradox) while, on the other hand, it is possible to refer to any word with a number, e.g. by the number of its position in a given dictionary or by suitable encoding. Some long strings can be described exactly using fewer symbols than those required by their full representation, as is often achieved using [[data compression]]. The complexity of a given string is then defined as the minimal length that a description requires in order to (unambiguously) refer to the full representation of that string.

The Kolmogorov complexity is defined using [[formal language]]s, or [[Turing machines]] which avoids ambiguities about which string results from a given description. It can be proven that the Kolmogorov complexity is not computable. The proof by contradiction shows that if it were possible to compute the Kolmogorov complexity, then it would also be possible to systematically generate paradoxes similar to this one, i.e. descriptions shorter than what the complexity of the described string implies. That is to say, the definition of the Berry number is paradoxical because it is not actually possible to compute how many words are required to define a number, and we know that such computation is not possible because of the paradox.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6325">[[File:Miniaturkunst aus dem Alten Orient.jpg|thumb|Miniature art from the Old Orient]]
The '''Bible and Orient Museum''' (officially: ''BIBLE+ORIENT Museum'') in [[Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]] is the exhibition of a collection of [[ancient Egypt]]ian and [[ancient Near East]]ern [[miniature art]], as well as a project to create a modern museum to compare biblical and extra-biblical texts with [[Archaeology|archaeological]], [[Epigraphy|epigraphical]] and [[Iconography|iconographical]] data. This comparison is aimed at offering stimulating insights for the advancement of the interreligious dialog.

==Responsible body==
The Swiss [[Canton of Fribourg]], the [[University of Fribourg]] and the promoters association «project BIBLE+ORIENT» created the foundation BIBEL+ORIENT&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bible-orient-museum.ch/index.php/de/information/leitideen-traegerschaft/140-stiftung-bibelorient|title=Stiftung BIBEL+ORIENT|last=BOM-Admin|website=www.bible-orient-museum.ch|language=de-de|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005 for the purpose of valorizing and expanding the collection with the aim of its efficient publication and the future construction and operation of a Bible and Orient Museum.

==Formation and purpose==
Already as a student, the biblical, religious science and [[Egyptology]] professor Othmar Keel collected miniature image carriers such as [[Cylinder seal]]s, [[Scarab (artifact)|scarabs]] and [[amulet]]s on his trips to the region of Southwestern Asia and the ancient Near East. Five to three thousand years ago, this “miniature art”, which could easily be carried over long distances, distributed – as a sort of mass communication – important motives and [[symbol]]s. At that time it represented important symbols of protection and power and today it reveals the close bonds of the Bible with its ancient Near Eastern surroundings. Keel observed that without knowledge of these symbols, many biblical comparisons, symbols and visions cannot be properly understood and thereby demonstrated the general importance of ancient Near Eastern cultural history for [[Biblical studies|biblical science]].

By interpreting biblical texts in their historical context, a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]]-[[Biblical literalism|literal]] understanding of the Bible can be avoided. Furthermore, this approach shows the relations between [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]], between [[Christianity]] and Judaism, between Judaism and ancient Near Eastern [[Paganism]], and thereby relativizes the claim to absolute truth by the [[Monotheism|monotheist]] religions.

Subsequently, Keel and his colleagues successfully collected more of these precious objects. The midterm goal is to erect an adequate museum with the aim of transmitting knowledge in new ways.

===Today’s collection===
[[File:Ausstellungskabinett BIBEL+ORIENT Museum.jpg|thumb|Today’s collection of the Museum]]
Since 1975, considerable donations have allowed the acquisition of over 15.000 unique items from the ancient Near East. Many of them are exposed in a permanent exhibition with 57 extendable, illuminated drawers and 6 showcases, offering a significant insight into the world of the ancient Near East, out of which the Bible emerged.

Among them are Early [[Paleolithic]] fist wedges from Syria; Near Eastern, particularly [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], Old-[[Babylonian religion|Babylonian]], Old Syrian, [[Mitanni]] and New [[Assyria]]n [[cylinder seal]]s; Near Eastern, prehistoric and Iron Age [[stamp seal]]s; Near Eastern [[terra cotta]], [[Cult image|idols]], amulets, etc.; [[Cuneiform script| Cuneiform script boards]], from Old [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] to [[Persia]]n, partly with cylinder seal impressions; Palestinian vessels, partly from the excavations on the Tel Kinneret (Israel);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kinneret-excavations.org/|title=Kinneret Regional Project – An international expedition to the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee|website=www.kinneret-excavations.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; scarabs and similar Egyptian and Egypt-like seal amulets (worldwide the third largest collection of its kind); blank scarabs and scarab amulets; Egyptian amulets and bronzes; Egyptian amulet forms; Ancient Egyptian [[stele]]s, [[Bronze sculpture|bronzes]] and [[relief]]s; [[clay tablet]]s; tools; weapons; ceramics; manuscripts of biblical texts; Torah and Esther roles; a Samaritan Pentateuch; editions of the Koran; coins; lamps; Palestinian [[ethnological|ethnologica]].

===Special exhibitions===
[[File:Heinrichsturm j.jpg|thumb|Henry Tower]]
In the past years, the following special exhibitions were conceived and realized with considerable success in Switzerland and Germany, using parts of the collection and interpretations thereof: ''Animals in the Bible'', ''Publicity for the Gods'', '' [[Solomon's Temple]] '', ''God as a woman'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gott-weiblich-bamberg.de/index.html Special exhibition ''God womanlike'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vertical [[Ecumenism]]''.

==Project for the Museum==
Between the train station and the University of Fribourg stands a 33 meter high defense tower constructed in 1415, which has been unused for decades. In 1998 the canton of Fribourg bought the area containing this so-called ''Henry Tower''. A feasibility study&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible-orient-museum.ch/index.php/de/zukunft/machbarkeitsstudie Feasibility study (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt; was carried out in order to assess the possibility of installing the museum in this tower and on the adjacent area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20693">'''Biodiversity Informatics''' is the application of [[informatics (academic field)|informatics]] techniques to [[biodiversity|biodiversity information]] for improved management, presentation, discovery, exploration and analysis. It typically builds on a foundation of [[Biological classification|taxonomic]], [[biogeography|biogeographic]], or [[ecology|ecological]] information stored in digital form, which, with the application of modern computer techniques, can yield new ways to view and analyse existing information, as well as predictive models for information that does not yet exist (see [[environmental niche modelling|niche modelling]]). Biodiversity informatics is a relatively young discipline (the term was coined in or around 1992) but has hundreds of practitioners worldwide, including the numerous individuals involved with the design and construction of [[taxonomic database]]s. The term "Biodiversity Informatics" is generally used in the broad sense to apply to computerized handling of any biodiversity information; the somewhat broader term "[[bioinformatics]]" is often used synonymously with the computerized handling of data in the specialized area of [[molecular biology]].

== Overview ==

Biodiversity informatics (different but linked to bioinformatics) is the application of information technology methods to the problems of organizing, accessing, visualizing and analyzing primary biodiversity data. Primary biodiversity data is composed of names, observations and records of specimens, and genetic and morphological data associated to a specimen. Biodiversity informatics may also have to cope with managing information from unnamed taxa such as that produced by environmental sampling and sequencing of mixed-field samples. The term biodiversity informatics is also used to cover the [[computational problem]]s specific to the names of biological entities, such as the development of algorithms to cope with variant representations of identifiers such as species names and authorities, and the multiple classification schemes within which these entities may reside according to the preferences of different workers in the field, as well as the syntax and semantics by which the content in taxonomic databases can be made machine queryable and interoperable for biodiversity informatics purposes...

== History of the discipline ==

Biodiversity Informatics can be considered to have commenced with the construction of the first computerized [[taxonomic database]]s in the early 1970s, and progressed through subsequent developing of distributed search tools towards the late 1990s including the Species Analyst from Kansas University, the North American Biodiversity Information Network NABIN, CONABIO in Mexico, and others,&lt;ref name="Krishtalka2000"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Krishtalka L, Humphrey PS|lastauthoramp=yes |year= 2000|title=Can Natural History Museums Capture the Future?|journal=BioScience|volume=50|pages=611–617|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.1641/0006-3568%282000%29050%5B0611%3ACNHMCT%5D2.0.CO%3B2|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2000)050[0611:CNHMCT]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the establishment of the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]] in 2001, and the parallel development of a variety of [[niche modelling]] and other tools to operate on digitized biodiversity data from the mid-1980s onwards (e.g. see &lt;ref name="Peterson2001"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Peterson AT, Vieglais D|lastauthoramp=yes |year= 2001|title=Predicting Species Invasions Using Ecological Niche Modeling: New Approaches from Bioinformatics Attack a Pressing Problem|journal=BioScience|volume=51|pages=363–371|url=http://www.cria.org.br/eventos/mfmpe/19_20jun2002_docs/BioScience%202001.pdf|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0363:PSIUEN]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In September 2000, the U.S. journal [[Science (journal)|Science]] devoted a special issue to "Bioinformatics for Biodiversity",&lt;ref name="Science_Sep_2000"&gt;{{cite journal|year= 2000|title=Bioinformatics for Biodiversity?|journal=Science|volume=289|pages=2229–2440|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol289/issue5488/index.dtl}}&lt;/ref&gt; the journal "Biodiversity Informatics" commenced publication in 2004, and several international conferences through the 2000s have brought together Biodiversity Informatics practitioners, including the London [http://www.e-biosphere09.org/ e-Biosphere] conference in June 2009. A supplement to the journal [[BMC Bioinformatics]] (Volume 10 Suppl 14&lt;ref name="BMC_Bioinformatics2009"&gt;{{cite journal|year= 2009|title=Biodiversity Informatics|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|volume=10 Suppl 14|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10?issue=S14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) published in November 2009 also deals with Biodiversity Informatics.

== History of the term ==

According to correspondence reproduced by Walter Berendsohn,&lt;ref name="BITheTerm"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bgbm.org/BioDivInf/TheTerm.htm| accessdate = 2009-08-06 | title = "Biodiversity Informatics", The Term}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term "Biodiversity Informatics" was coined by John Whiting in 1992 to cover the activities of an entity known as the Canadian Biodiversity Informatics Consortium, a group involved with fusing basic [[biodiversity]] information with [[environmental economics]] and geospatial information in the form of [[GPS]] and [[GIS]]. Subsequently, it appears to have lost any obligate connection with the GPS/GIS world and be associated with the computerized management of any aspects of biodiversity information (e.g. see &lt;ref name="Bisby2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bisby FA|year= 2000|title=The Quiet Revolution: Biodiversity Informatics and the Internet|journal=Science|volume=289|pages=2309–2312|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/289/5488/2309|doi=10.1126/science.289.5488.2309|pmid=11009408|issue=5488|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Current Biodiversity Informatics issues ==

=== Global list of all species ===

One major issue for biodiversity informatics at a global scale is the current absence of a complete master list of [[Global biodiversity|currently recognised species of the world]], although this is an aim of the [[Catalogue of Life]] project which has ca. 1.65 million species of an estimated 1.9 million described species in its [http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2016/info/ac 2016 Annual Checklist]. A similar effort for fossil taxa, the Paleobiology Database&lt;ref name="PaleoDB"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://paleodb.org/| accessdate = 2009-08-06 | title = the Paleobiology Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; documents some 100,000+ names for fossil species, out of an unknown total number.

=== Genus and species scientific names as unique identifiers ===

Application of the [[Linnaeus|Linnaean]] system of binomial nomenclature for [[species]], and uninomials for [[genus|genera]] and higher ranks, has led to many advantages but also problems with [[Homonym (biology)|homonyms]] (the same name being used for multiple taxa, either inadvertently or legitimately across multiple kingdoms), [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] (multiple names for the same taxon), as well as variant representations of the same name due to orthographic differences, minor spelling errors, variation in the manner of citation of author names and dates, and more. In addition, names can change through time on account of changing taxonomic opinions (for example, the correct generic placement of a species, or the elevation of a subspecies to species rank or vice versa), and also the circumscription of a taxon can change according to different authors' taxonomic concepts. One proposed solution to this problem is the usage of Life Science Identifiers ([[LSID]]s) for machine-machine communication purposes, although there are both proponents and opponents of this approach.

=== A consensus classification of organisms ===

Organisms can be classified in a multitude of ways (see main page [[Biological classification]]), which can create design problems for Biodiversity Informatics systems aimed at incorporating either a single or multiple classification to suit the needs of users, or to guide them towards a single "preferred" system. Whether a single consensus classification system can ever be achieved is probably an open question, however the Catalogue of Life has commissioned activity in this area&lt;ref name="CoL2009Gordon"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.catalogueoflife.org/info_hierarchy.php|accessdate = 2009-08-06|title = Towards a management hierarchy (classification) for the Catalogue of Life.

== Mobilizing primary biodiversity information ==

"Primary" biodiversity information can be considered the basic data on the occurrence and diversity of species (or indeed, any recognizable taxa), commonly in association with information regarding their distribution in either space, time, or both. Such information may be in the form of retained specimens and associated information, for example as assembled in the natural history collections of [[museum]]s and [[herbarium|herbaria]], or as observational records, for example either from formal faunal or floristic surveys undertaken by professional biologists and students, or as amateur and other planned or unplanned observations including those increasingly coming under the scope of [[citizen science]]. Providing online, coherent digital access to this vast collection of disparate primary data is a core Biodiversity Informatics function that is at the heart of regional and global biodiversity data networks, examples of the latter including [[OBIS]] and [[GBIF]].

As a secondary source of biodiversity data, relevant [[scientific literature]] can be parsed either by humans or (potentially) by specialized information retrieval algorithms to extract the relevant primary biodiversity information that is reported therein, sometimes in aggregated / summary form but frequently as primary observations in narrative or tabular form. Elements of such activity (such as extracting key taxonomic identifiers, keywording / [[index term]]s, etc.) have been practiced for many years at a higher level by selected [[academic databases and search engines]]. However, for the maximum Biodiversity Informatics value, the actual primary occurrence data should ideally be retrieved and then made available in a standardized form or forms; for example both the [[Plazi]] and [http://www.inotaxa.org/ INOTAXA] projects are transforming taxonomic literature into [[XML]] formats that can then be read by client applications, the former using [http://sourceforge.net/projects/taxonx/ TaxonX-XML] and the latter using the taXMLit format. The [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]] is also making significant progress in its aim to digitize substantial portions of the out-of-copyright taxonomic literature, which is then subjected to [[optical character recognition|OCR]] (optical character recognition) so as to be amenable to further processing using Biodiversity Informatics tools.

== Standards and protocols ==

In common with other data-related disciplines, Biodiversity Informatics benefits from the adoption of appropriate [[technical standard|standard]]s and [[protocol (computing)|protocols]] in order to support machine-machine transmission and interoperability of information within its particular domain. Examples of relevant standards include the [[Darwin Core]] [[XML]] [[XML schema|schema]] for specimen- and observation-based biodiversity data developed from 1998 onwards, plus extensions of the same, [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/117/ Taxonomic Concept Transfer Schema], plus standards for [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/116/ Structured Descriptive Data] and [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/115/ Access to Biological Collection Data] (ABCD); while data retrieval and transfer protocols include [http://digir.sourceforge.net/ DiGIR] (now mostly superseded) and [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/449/ TAPIR] (TDWG Access Protocol for Information Retrieval). Many of these standards and protocols are currently maintained, and their development overseen, by the [[TDWG|Taxonomic Databases Working Group]] (TDWG).

== Current activities ==

At the 2009 e-Biosphere conference in the U.K.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-biosphere09.org/&lt;/ref&gt; the following themes were adopted, which is indicative of a broad range of current Biodiversity Informatics activities and how they might be categorized:

* Application: Conservation / Agriculture / Fisheries / Industry / Forestry
* Application: Invasive Alien Species
* Application: Systematic and Evolutionary Biology
* Application: Taxonomy and Identification Systems
* New Tools, Services and Standards for Data Management and Access
** New Modeling Tools
** New Tools for Data Integration
** New Approaches to Biodiversity Infrastructure
** New Approaches to Species Identification
** New Approaches to Mapping Biodiversity
* National and Regional Biodiversity Databases and Networks

A post-conference workshop of key persons with current significant Biodiversity Informatics roles also resulted in a [https://web.archive.org/web/20120226041400/http://www.e-biosphere09.org/assets/files/workshop/Resolution.pdf Workshop Resolution] that stressed, among other aspects, the need to create durable, global registries for the resources that are basic to biodiversity informatics (e.g., repositories, collections); complete the construction of a solid taxonomic infrastructure; and create ontologies for biodiversity data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17035">'''Branding national myths and symbols'''&lt;ref name="A4"/&gt; ('''BNMS''') is a field of research focusing on [[brand]]ing and [[marketing]] of a nation's [[Mythology|myths]] and [[National symbol|symbols]].  The research blends the theories of marketing, cultural communications, [[sociology]], public relations, and [[semiotics]].  The awareness of a nation’s (or a collective group’s) internal myths and symbols may result in raising cultural relations between nations, according to this theory.  The use dates from before the 1990, and field of study dates from about 2000, but was not given this moniker by a scholar until 2009.

The principles of BNMS are related to, but are different from [[Nation branding]]. The main difference between two principles is that nation branding is primarily concerned with raising the global image of a nation for better economic return, while BNMS is concerned with the revealing and demonstrating the meanings behind a nation’s internal myths and symbols. In other words, nation branding is the selling or promotion of the external identity of a nation, while BNMS is the revealing of their internal identity, either for its own citizens to believe in, or to achieve better global relations between nations. According to the theory, each national myth and symbol has its own hidden meanings that may reinforce these misunderstandings between nations.

Examples of BNMS include changing the symbols on currency, a national anthem (see, ''e.g.'', [[National Anthem Project]] by the [[United States]]), and advertising in political campaigns.

==Core concepts==
A [[national myth]] is an inspiring narrative or [[anecdote]] about a nation's past. Such myths often serve as an important [[national symbol]] and affirm a set of national values.  A national myth may sometimes take the form of a [[national epic]], part of the nation's [[civil religion]], a legend or fictionalized narrative, which has been elevated to serious [[mythology|mythological]], symbolical and esteemed level so as to be true to the nation.&lt;ref name=Renan&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Ernest Renan |last=Renan |first=Ernest |year=1882 |title=Qu'est-ce qu'une nation? |title-link=:s:fr:Qu'est-ce qu'une nation ? }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It might simply over-dramatize true incidents, omit important historical details, or add details for which there is no evidence; or it might simply be a fictional story that no one takes to be true literally,&lt;ref name=Abizadeh&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Abizadeh |first=Arash |year=2004 |title=Historical Truth, National Myths, and Liberal Democracy |journal=Journal of Political Philosophy |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=291–313 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9760.2004.00201.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; but contains a symbolic meaning for the nation.

The national folklore of many nations includes a [[founding myth]], which may involve a struggle against [[colonialism]] or a [[war of independence (disambiguation)|war of independence]].  National myths serve many social and political purposes, such as state-sponsored [[propaganda]], or of inspiring civic virtue and self-sacrifice.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{Cite book |last=Miller |first=David |year=1995 |title=On Nationality |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-828047-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the meaning of the national myth may become disputed among different parts of the population, such as majority and minority groups, which makes ''branding'' and ''advertising'' of the national myth necessary.&lt;ref name="A8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A2" /&gt;

The [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) has conducted a number of symposia on the protection of [[folklore]], ''i.e.'', "traditional cultural expressions",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/topic.jsp?group_id=82 WIPO website|title=Folklore (Traditional Cultural Expressions)|publisher=[[WIPO]]|date=|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of preventing their "misappropriation" by branding, patenting, trademarking, or copyright by other persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/ WIPO website|title=Folklore (Traditional Cultural Expressions)|publisher=[[WIPO]]|date=|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent examples==
A recent, clear example as of 2011 is the use of "Greco-Roman symbols merged into Christianity" on the [[Euro]] note.&lt;ref name=Euro&gt;Hatice Sitki, "EU-Turkey: Atatürk and Charlemagne on your euro notes," ''CafeBabel.com'', 8 February 2011.  Found at [http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/36313/europe-turkey-symbols-charlemagne-ataturk-empires.html#none cafebabel.co.uk website].  Accessed February 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many nations have put their national ideas on their money "via branding national myths and symbols."&lt;ref name=Euro /&gt;  The image of the crowning [[Charlemagne]] is on a Euro note, because he is "accepted as the Father of Europe and thereby of the EU, with buildings and rooms named after him."&lt;ref name=Euro /&gt;  The accepted "symbol for EU culture ... symbolises a Doric column ..." but does not necessarily represent Europe’s other cultures (Norse, etc.).&lt;ref name=Euro /&gt;  Ultimately, Europe is based on the myth of the demi-god ''[[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]'' and many of its symbols are based on ancient Greek art forms.&lt;ref name=Euro /&gt;  If Turkey joined the EU, the current images could be a source of conflict:&lt;ref name=Euro /&gt;
{{quote|According to Homer, Europa was born in Asia Minor in the east, so Anatolia or modern-day Turkey. After Europa was abducted by Zeus in his form as a white bull, she spent her adult life with him and their three boys in Crete, Greece. Posthumously, Europa is considered as the geographical mother of a land mass. To complete this circle, Europa needs to acknowledge her filial and ancestor duties towards her Asia Minor children. Symbols like these will exasperate and perpetuate the existing mutual misunderstandings between Turkey and the EU. No matter how much each of them would like to understand the other, ultimately, without an adjustment of these symbols, their attempts will be lukewarm and ineffective.|Hatice Sitki &lt;ref name=Euro /&gt;}}

Another example from 2011 is that of [[Japan]]'s self-branding of [[Science and technology in Japan|its scientific expertise]], which fell apart after [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|the earthquake and tsunami]] that March, followed by the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|nuclear accidents]].&lt;ref name=Numano&gt;Mitsuyoshi Numano, (trans. Joel R. Cohn), "Beyond expectations," in "A Country's Lasting Aftershocks," ''[[New York Times]]'', March 20, 2011, Week in Review, p. 12.  Found online at [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/opinion/20superhed.html?pagewanted=2 New York Times website]. Accessed March 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[New York Times]]'', Mitsuyoshi Numano wrote, "It even begins to appear that Japan’s vaunted scientific and technical prowess has taken on the character of a kind of myth, and that myth has deluded the nation’s politicians and business leaders."&lt;ref name=Numano /&gt;

==Research in the field==
Jonathan Rose first wrote about this concept in 2000, in which he claimed that Canada has had "an unholy alliance between advertising agencies and political parties" since the formation of the Confederation in 1867.&lt;ref name="A8"&gt;Ian R. Sadinsky and Thomas K. Gussman, "Federal Government Advertising and Sponsorships: New Directions in Management and Oversight", CISPAA, Volume 2, number 7, pp. 305, 306, found at [http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/groupaction/v2fullreport/CISPAA_Vol2_7.pdf CBC website], citing Jonathan W. Rose, ''Making 'Pictures in Our Heads' — Government Advertising in Canada'' (Praeger Series in Political Communication, 2000), found at [https://books.google.com/books?id=3s8xtWW-HjYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Government+Advertising+in+Canada%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yH4vTc3MGIP68Abq4aCOCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books].  Both accessed January 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2003 article, Rose wrote that national myths and symbols reinforce and create a "community and binding [its citizens]. These myths are not judged on their veracity but rather [on] their metaphorical and symbolic meaning."&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt;  Rose maintained that the messages within these "created" myths are disseminated and ultimately maintained through its "civil society from its institutions, public policies and government".&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt;  His [[prototype|prototypical]] study was on the [[Canada|Canadian]] government's creation of national myths in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt;  Rose pointed out what was unique (in the 1980s) several major points:
# "government advertising is used to create and develop national symbols and myths."
# that government used "advertising [that] centres around the existence of sub-national minorities," particularly to respond to threats from time to time of successionism in the province of [[Quebec]], which could be generalized to other nations with vocal minorities.
# "advertising has become so pervasive in Canadian politics that issues requiring popular support are more than likely to be brought to the public directly through advertising campaigns."&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt;

''Branding National Myths and Symbols'' was first coined in 2009 by Turkish-Australian scholar Hatice Sitki, who proposed in ''Myths, Symbols and Branding: Turkish National Identity and the EU'', that these long-existing myths keep us from truly understanding and working with the "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]".&lt;ref name="A4"/&gt;  Sitki proposes that cultural misunderstanding will continue between nations until they understand one another’s cultural myths and symbols.&lt;ref name="A4"/&gt; Sitki explains in the ''Cyclical Formula "Us/Other+Other"'', how [[Turkey]] and the [[European Union]] can benefit by accepting that they have, and continue, to play a "triple role" to one another.&lt;ref name="A4"/&gt;

''BNMS'' argues that collective groups such as the EU do not need to be "branded" in order to improve their economic value. Rather, they need to be branded to achieve their cultural goal of moving from a "[[Polyculturalism|poly-cultural]]" society to becoming a "[[multiculturalism|multicultural]]"&lt;ref name="A3"/&gt; society. One way for this to be achieved is for nations to realise and work with the hidden meanings of their myths and symbols. Vijay Prashad proposes that the concept of polyculturalism is a way to combat anti-[[racism]]. Prashad defines poly cultures as a "provisional concept grounded in antiracism, rather than in diversity..."&lt;ref name="A5"/&gt; Roger Hewitt takes a different approach to how peoples with different languages can understand each other.  Hewitt argues that the concept of polyculturalism is "not intrinsically equal."&lt;ref name="A6"/&gt;

The "national myths" used in ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'' lead to "strengthen[ing] imperial attitudes", according to a 2009 book about the spate of Victorian British novels made in films from the 1980s through the 21st Century, and sources it cited.&lt;ref name="A7"&gt;Dianne F. Sadoff, ''Victorian Vogue: British Novels on Screen'', (U of Minnesota Press, 2009), p. 29, {{ISBN|978-0-8166-6092-6}}, citing works by Timothy Brennan and Jonathan Rose.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16537">A '''character''' (sometimes known as a '''fictional character''') is a [[person]] or other being in a [[narrative]] (such as a [[novel]], [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[television series]], [[film]], or [[video game]]).&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Freeman|title=Historicising Transmedia Storytelling: Early Twentieth-Century Transmedia Story Worlds|isbn =1315439506|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2016|pages=31–34|accessdate=January 19, 2017 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDBuDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria DiBattista|title=Novel Characters: A Genealogy|isbn =1444351559|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2011|pages=14–20|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uATBJUxMqEC&amp;pg=PT14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldick (2001, 37) and Childs and Fowler (2006, 23). See also "character, 10b" in Trumble and Stevenson (2003, 381): "A person portrayed in a novel, a drama, etc; a part played by an actor".&lt;/ref&gt; The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a "fictional" versus "real" character may be made.&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Derived from the [[ancient Greek]] word χαρακτήρ, the English word dates from the [[English Restoration|Restoration]],&lt;ref&gt;''OED'' "character" sense 17.a citing, ''inter alia'', [[John Dryden|Dryden's]] 1679 preface to ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'': "The chief character or Hero in a Tragedy ... ought in prudence to be such a man, who has so much more in him of Virtue than of Vice... If Creon had been the chief character in ''Œdipus''..."&lt;/ref&gt; although it became widely used after its appearance in ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]''  in 1749.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34), quotation: {{quotation|[...] is first used in English to denote 'a personality in a novel or a play' in 1749 (''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v.).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt; From this, the sense of "a part played by an [[actor]]" developed.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51&gt;Harrison (1998, 51-2) quotation: {{quotation|Its use as 'the sum of the qualities which constitute an individual' is a mC17 development. The modern literary and theatrical sense of 'an individual created in a fictitious work' is not attested in OED until mC18: 'Whatever characters any... have for the jestsake personated... are now thrown off' (1749, Fielding, ''Tom Jones'').}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the [[theatre]] or [[film|cinema]], involves "the illusion of being a human person".&lt;ref&gt;Pavis (1998, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Characters as Guides to Meaning | journal = The Reading Teacher | first = Nancy | last = Roser |author2=Miriam Martinez|author3=Charles Fuhrken|author4=Kathleen McDonnold | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 548–559| id = | accessdate = 2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase "in character" has been used to describe an effective [[impersonation]]  by an actor.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt; Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called [[characterisation]].&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt;

A character who stands as a representative of a particular [[Social class|class]] or group of people is known as a type.&lt;ref name=b265&gt;Baldick (2001, 265).&lt;/ref&gt; Types include both [[stock character]]s and those that are more fully [[individual]]ised.&lt;ref name=b265/&gt; The characters in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1891) and [[August Strindberg]]'s ''[[Miss Julie]]'' (1888), for example, are representative of specific positions in the [[social relation]]s of class and [[gender]], such that the [[Conflict (narrative)|conflicts]] between the characters reveal [[Ideology|ideological]] conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 35).&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 41).&lt;/ref&gt; The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions (proairetic, [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]], [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Proxemics|proxemic]]) that it forms with the other characters.&lt;ref&gt;Elam (2002, 133).&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often [[Mimesis|miming]] shifts in society and its ideas about human [[individual]]ity, [[self-determination]], and the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs and Fowler (2006, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
In [[fiction writing]], authors create dynamic characters by many methods.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Sometimes characters are conjured up from imagination; in other instances, they are created by amplifying the character trait of a real person into a new fictional creation, or are created from scratch as a matter of expediency.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt;

==Types==

===Round vs. flat=== &lt;!-- Characterization links here. --&gt;
In his book ''Aspects of the Novel'', [[E. M. Forster]] defined two basic types of characters, their qualities, functions, and importance for the development of the novel: '''flat''' characters and '''round''' characters.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Michael J|author2=Patrick D. Murphy|title=Essentials of the theory of fiction|publisher=Duke University Press, 1996|edition=2|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8223-1823-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat characters are two-dimensional, in that they are relatively uncomplicated. By contrast, round characters are complex figures with many different characteristics, that undergo development, sometimes sufficiently to surprise the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster|first=E.M.|title=Aspects of the Novel|year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Sue]]s are characters mainly appearing in [[fan fiction]]. They are virtually devoid of flaws,&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lucy Bennett, Paul Booth|title=Seeing Fans: Representations of Fandom in Media and Popular Culture|isbn =1501318470|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] USA|year=2016|page=160|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydwuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore considered flat characters.

===Dynamic vs. static===
'''Dynamic''' characters are those that change over the course of the story, while '''static''' characters remain the same throughout. An example of a popular static character in literature is [[Sherlock Holmes]]; an example of a dynamic character in literature is [[Ebenezer Scrooge]].

===Regular, recurring and guest characters===
In television, a regular, main or ongoing character is a character who appears in all or a majority of episodes, or in a significant chain of episodes of the series.&lt;ref&gt;The TV Writer's Workbook: A Creative Approach To Television Scripts [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YeCet_B_-IC&amp;pg=PA40 p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt; Regular characters may be both core and secondary ones. 

A [[recurring character]] often and frequently appears from time to time during the series' run.&lt;ref name="Crafty"&gt;{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=Alex |title=Crafty TV Writing: Thinking Inside the Box |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year= 2006 |isbn=0-8050-8028-7 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring characters often play major roles in more than one episode, sometimes being the main focus.

A guest character is one which acts only in a few episodes or scenes. Unlike regular characters, the guest ones do not need to be carefully incorporated into the storyline with all its ramifications: they create a piece of drama and then disappear without consequences to the narrative structure, unlike core characters, for which any significant conflict must be traced during a considerable time, which is often seen as an unjustified waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Greg M. Smith, ''Beautiful TV: The Art and Argument of Ally McBeal'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA147 p. 147]&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be a continuing or recurring guest character.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a guest character may gain popularity and turn into a regular one.&lt;ref&gt;David Kukoff, ''Vault Guide to Television Writing Careers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=T9zj0AqB6bUC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical analysis==
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

In the earliest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE), the [[Greek philosophy|Classical Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] deduces that character (''[[ethos]]'') is one of six qualitative parts of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] and one of the three objects that it [[Mimesis|represents]] (1450a12).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8). Aristotle defines the six qualitative elements of tragedy as "plot, character, diction, reasoning, spectacle and song" (1450a10); the three objects are plot (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]''), character (''[[ethos]]''), and reasoning (''[[dianoia]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; He understands character not to denote a fictional person, but the quality of the person acting in the story and reacting to its situations (1450a5).&lt;ref name=j984&gt;Janko (1987, 9, 84).&lt;/ref&gt; He defines character as "that which reveals [[Decision making|decision]], of whatever sort" (1450b8).&lt;ref name=j984/&gt; It is possible, therefore, to have stories that do not contain "characters" in Aristotle's sense of the word, since character necessarily involves making the [[Ethics|ethical]] dispositions of those performing the action clear.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle writes: "Again, without action a tragedy cannot exist, but without characters it may. For the tragedies of most recent [poets] lack character, and in general there are many such poets" (1450a24-25); see Janko (1987, 9, 86).&lt;/ref&gt; If, in speeches, the speaker "decides or avoids nothing at all", then those speeches "do not have character" (1450b9—11).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 9).&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle argues for the primacy of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'') over character (''[[ethos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34) and Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the most important of these is the structure of the incidents. For (i) tragedy is a representation not of human beings but of action and life. Happiness and unhappiness lie in action, and the end [of life] is a sort of action, not a quality; people are of a certain sort according to their characters, but happy or the opposite according to their actions. So [the actors] do not act in order to represent the characters, but they include the characters for the sake of their actions" (1450a15-23).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Aristotle suggests that works were distinguished in the first instance according to the nature of the person who created them: "the grander people represented fine actions, i.e. those of fine persons" by producing "hymns and praise-poems", while "ordinary people represented those of inferior ones" by "composing invectives" (1448b20—1449a5).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 5). This distinction, Aristotle argues, arises from two causes that are natural and common to all humans—the delight taken in experiencing representations and the way in which we learn through imitation (1448b4—19); see Janko (1987, 4—5).&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, a distinction between the individuals represented in tragedy and in comedy arose: tragedy, along with [[epic poetry]], is "a representation of serious people" (1449b9—10), while [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] is "a representation of people who are rather inferior" (1449a32—33).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 6—7). Aristotle specifies that comedy does not represent all kinds of ugliness and vice, but only that which is laughable (1449a32—1449a37).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Tractatus coislinianus]]'' (which may or may not be by Aristotle), [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is defined as involving three types of characters: the [[buffoon]] (''[[bômolochus]]''), the [[Irony|ironist]] (''[[eirôn]]''), and the [[imposter]] or boaster (''[[alazôn]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; All three are central to [[Aristophanes]]' "[[old comedy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 170).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] comic playwright [[Plautus]] wrote his plays two centuries later, the use of characters to define dramatic [[genre]]s was well established.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 22).&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]'' begins with a [[prologue]] in which [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] claims that since the play contains kings and gods, it cannot be a comedy and must be a [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amphritruo'', line 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chemotrophs''' are organisms that obtain [[energy]] by the [[oxidation]] of [[electron donor]]s in their environments.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160912"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Visions of Life on Mars in Earth’s Depths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |date=12 September 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These molecules can be [[organic molecule|organic]] ([[chemoorganotroph]]s) or [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] ([[chemolithotroph]]s).  The chemotroph designation is in contrast to [[phototroph]]s, which utilize solar energy. Chemotrophs can be either [[autotroph]]ic or [[heterotroph]]ic. Chemotrophs are commonly found in ocean floors where sunlight cannot reach them because they are not dependent on solar energy. Ocean floors often contain underwater volcanos that can provide heat as a substitute for sunlight's warmth.

==Chemoautotroph== 
'''Chemoautotrophs''' (or chemotrophic autotroph) (''[[Ancient Greek language|Greek]]'': Chemo (χημία) = chemical, auto (αὐτός) = self, troph (τροφιά) = nourishment), in addition to deriving energy from [[chemical reaction]]s, synthesize all necessary organic compounds from [[carbon dioxide]]. Chemoautotrophs use inorganic energy sources such as [[hydrogen sulfide]], elemental [[sulfur]], [[iron(II) oxide|ferrous iron]], molecular [[hydrogen]], and [[ammonia]].  Most chemoautotrophs are [[extremophile]]s, [[bacteria]] or [[archaea]] that live in hostile environments (such as [[deep sea vent]]s) and are the [[primary producer]]s in such [[ecosystem]]s. Chemoautotrophs generally fall into several groups: [[methanogen]]s, [[halophile]]s, [[Microbial metabolism#Sulfur oxidation|sulfur oxidizers]] and [[Sulfur-reducing bacteria|reducer]]s, [[nitrification|nitrifiers]], [[anammox]] bacteria, and [[thermoacidophile]]s. An example of one of these prokaryotes would be [[Sulfolobus]]. Chemolithotrophic growth can be dramatically fast, such as ''[[Hydrogenovibrio crunogenus]]'' with a [[doubling time]] around one hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1128/JB.187.16.5761-5766.2005 | pmid=16077123 | volume=187 | issue=16 | title=The Carbon-Concentrating Mechanism of the Hydrothermal Vent Chemolithoautotroph Thiomicrospira crunogena | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Bacteriology | pages=5761–5766 | last1 = Dobrinski | first1 = K.

The term "[[chemosynthesis]]", coined in 1897 by [[Wilhelm Pfeffer]], originally was defined as the energy production by oxidation of inorganic substances in association with [[autotrophy]] - what would be named today as chemolithoautotrophy. Later, the term would include also the chemoorganoautotrophy, that is, it can be seen as a synonym of [[chemoautotrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, D. P., &amp; Wood, A. P. (2006).

==Chemoheterotroph==
'''Chemoheterotrophs''' (or chemotrophic heterotrophs) (''[[Ancient greek language|Gr]]'': Chemo (χημία) = chemical, hetero (ἕτερος) = (an)other, troph (τροφιά) = nourishment) are unable to [[carbon fixation|fix carbon]] to form their own organic compounds.  Chemoheterotrophs can be chemolithoheterotrophs, utilizing inorganic energy sources such as sulfur or chemoorganoheterotrophs, utilizing organic energy sources such as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Davis| first= Mackenzie Leo| title= Principles of environmental engineering and science| year= 2004| publisher=清华大学出版社| page= 133| url= https://books.google.com/?id=e0OsNiQthNQC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=chemoheterotroph&amp;cd=41#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-7-302-09724-2|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Lengeler| first1= Joseph W.| last2= Drews| first2= Gerhart| last3= Schlegel| first3= Hans Günter| title= Biology of the Prokaryotes| year= 1999| publisher= Georg Thieme Verlag| page= 238| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MiwpFtTdmjQC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=chemolithoheterotroph+sulfur+bacteria&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=chemolithoheterotroph%20sulfur%20bacteria&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-3-13-108411-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Dworkin| first= Martin| title= The Prokaryotes: Ecophysiology and biochemistry| year= 2006| edition=3rd| publisher= Springer| page= 989| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uleTr2jKzJMC&amp;pg=PA989&amp;dq=chemolithoheterotroph+sulfur+bacteria&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=chemolithoheterotroph%20sulfur%20bacteria&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-0-387-25492-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Bergey| first= David Hendricks| last2= Holt| first2= John G.| title= Bergey's manual of determinative bacteriology| year= 1994| edition=9th| publisher= Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins| page= 427| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jtMLzaa5ONcC&amp;pg=PA427&amp;dq=chemolithotrophic+sulfur+bacteria&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=chemolithotrophic%20sulfur%20bacteria&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-0-683-00603-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most animals and fungi are examples of chemoheterotrophs.

==Iron- and manganese-oxidizing bacteria==
In the deep oceans, iron-oxidizing bacteria derive their energy needs by oxidizing ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) to ferric iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;). The electron conserved from this reaction reduces the [[respiratory chain]] and can be thus used in the synthesis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] by forward [[electron transport]] or [[NADH]] by reverse [[electron transport]], replacing or augmenting traditional [[phototrophism]].
*In general, iron-oxidizing bacteria can exist only in areas with high ferrous iron concentrations, such as new lava beds or areas of hydrothermal activity. Most of the ocean is devoid of ferrous iron, due to both the oxidative effect of dissolved oxygen in the water and the tendency of bacteria to take up the iron.
*Lava beds supply bacteria with ferrous iron straight from the Earth's mantle, but only newly formed [[igneous]] rocks have high enough levels of ferrous iron. In addition, because oxygen is necessary for the reaction, these bacteria are much more common in the upper ocean, where oxygen is more abundant.
*What is still unknown is how exactly iron bacteria extract iron from rock. It is accepted that some mechanism exists that eats away at the rock, perhaps through specialized [[enzyme]]s or compounds that bring more FeO to the surface. It has been long debated about how much of the weathering of the rock is due to [[biotic component]]s and how much can be attributed to [[abiotic component]]s.
*Hydrothermal vents also release large quantities of dissolved iron into the deep ocean, allowing bacteria to survive. In addition, the high thermal gradient around vent systems means a wide variety of bacteria can coexist, each with its own specialized temperature niche.
*Regardless of the [[catalytic]] method used, chemoautotrophic bacteria provide a significant but frequently overlooked food source for deep sea ecosystems - which otherwise receive limited sunlight and organic nutrients.

[[Manganese]]-oxidizing bacteria also make use of igneous lava rocks in much the same way; by oxidizing manganous manganese (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) into manganic (Mn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;) manganese. Manganese is more scarce than iron oceanic crust, but is much easier for bacteria to extract from igneous glass. In addition, each manganese oxidation donates two electrons to the cell versus one for each iron oxidation, though the amount of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] or [[NADH]] that can be synthesised in couple to these reactions varies with pH and specific reaction thermodynamics in terms of how much of a [[Gibbs free energy]] change there is during the oxidation reactions versus the energy change required for the formation of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] or [[NADH]], all of which vary with concentration, pH etc. Much still remains unknown about manganese-oxidizing bacteria because they have not been cultured and documented to any great extent.

{{Nationalism sidebar|Types}}
'''Civic nationalism''', also known as '''liberal nationalism''', is a form of [[nationalism]] identified by [[political philosophy|political philosophers]] who believe in an inclusive form of [[nationalism]] that adheres with traditional liberal values of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auer|first1=Stefan|title=Liberal Nationalism in Central Europe|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134378602|page=5|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=BhNsM_ttOb4C&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamir, Yael. 1993.

''[[Nations and Nationalism (journal)|Nations and Nationalism]]'' 10(3): 231-250.&lt;/ref&gt; Civic nationalism is frequently contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]].

[[Ernest Renan]] is often thought to be an early civic nationalist.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Renan. "[[What is a Nation?]]", 1882; cf. Chaim Gans, ''The Limits of Nationalism'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Civic nationhood is a political identity built around shared citizenship within the state. Thus, a "civic nation" isn't defined by its language or culture, but by its political institutions and liberal principles, which its citizens pledge to uphold. Membership in the civic nation is open to anyone who shares these values.&lt;ref name= definition&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|author=ANNA STILZ|title=Civic Nationalism and Language Policy|page=257|volume=37|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, a civic nation or state does not aim to promote one culture over another.&lt;ref name = definition/&gt; German philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] argued that immigrants to a [[Liberal democracy|liberal-democratic]] state need not assimilate into the host culture, but only need to accept the principles of the country's constitution (cf. [[Constitutional patriotism]]).&lt;ref name = definition/&gt;

==History==
{{or-section|date=January 2017}}
Civic nationalism lies within the traditions of [[rationalism]] and [[liberalism]], but as a form of nationalism it is contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]]. Membership of the civic [[nation]] is considered voluntary, as in [[Ernest Renan]]'s classical definition in "[[Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?]]" of the nation as a "daily referendum" characterized by the "will to live together".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Civic-national ideals influenced the development of [[representative democracy]] in countries such as the [[United States]] and [[France]] (see the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776, and the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' of 1789).

The Corsican nationalist movement organized around the [[FLNC]] is giving a civic definition of the Corsican nation ("destiny communauty") in the continuity of [[Pasquale Paoli]] and the ideas of the [[Lumières]].

The '''College of William &amp; Mary''' (also known as '''William &amp; Mary''', '''W&amp;M''', and officially '''The College of William and Mary in Virginia''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], [[Virginia]]. Founded in 1693 by [[Letter patent|letters patent]] issued by [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Queen Mary II]], it is the [[Colonial Colleges|second-oldest]] institution of [[higher education]] in the [[United States]], after [[Harvard University]].

William &amp; Mary educated American Presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]] (third), [[James Monroe]] (fifth), and [[John Tyler]] (tenth) as well as other key figures important to the development of the nation, including the fourth U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] of Virginia, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] [[Henry Clay]] of Kentucky, sixteen members of the [[Continental Congress]], and four signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], earning it the nickname "the Alma Mater of the Nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = William &amp; Mary – History of the College |url = https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/studenthandbook/history_of_the_college/index.php |website = www.wm.edu |accessdate = October 31, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151209211035/http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/studenthandbook/history_of_the_college/index.php |archive-date = December 9, 2015 |dead-url = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A young [[George Washington]] (1732–1799) also received his surveyor's license through the college. W&amp;M students founded the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] academic [[honor society]] in 1776 and W&amp;M was the first school of higher education in the United States to install an [[honor code]] of conduct for students. The establishment of graduate programs in law and medicine in 1779 makes it one of the [[first university in the United States|earliest higher level universities in the United States]].

In addition to its undergraduate program, W&amp;M is home to several graduate programs (including computer science, public policy, physics, and colonial history) and four professional schools (law, business, education, and marine science). In his 1985 book ''Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities'', Richard Moll categorized William &amp; Mary as one of eight "[[Public Ivies]]".

{{Main|History of the College of William &amp; Mary}}

===Colonial era: 1693–1776===
[[File:James Blair.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[James Blair (Virginia)|James Blair]], founder of William &amp; Mary]]
A school of higher education for both [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] young men and the sons of the colonists was one of the earliest goals of the leaders of the [[Colony of Virginia]]. The college was founded on February 8, 1693, under a royal charter (legally, letters patent) to "''make, found and establish a certain Place of Universal Study, a perpetual College of Divinity, Philosophy, Languages, and other good arts and sciences...to be supported and maintained, in all time coming.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swem.wm.edu/departments/special-collections/exhibits/exhibits/charter/charter/ |title=Earl Gregg Swem Library Special Collections |publisher=Swem.wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named in honor of the reigning monarchs [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]], the college is the second oldest college in the United States. The original plans for the college date back to 1618 but were thwarted by the [[Indian Massacre of 1622]], a change in government (in 1624, the Virginia Company's charter was revoked by King James I and the Virginia Colony was transferred to royal authority as a [[crown colony]]), events related to the [[English Civil War]], and [[Bacon's Rebellion]]. In 1695 before the town of Williamsburg existed, construction began on the College Building, now known as the Sir Christopher [[Wren Building]], in what was then called [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)]].  It is the oldest college building in America. The college is one of the country's nine [[Colonial Colleges]] founded before the [[American Revolution]]. The Charter named James Blair as the college's first president (a lifetime appointment which he held until his death in 1743). William &amp; Mary was founded as an [[Anglican]] institution; students were required to be members of the [[Church of England]], and professors were required to declare adherence to the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]].&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Homer J. (1902) "Schools and Colleges in Colonial Times", ''The New England Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly'', v. XXVII, p. 374, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC01644447&amp;pg=PA373 Google Books entry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506182259/https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC01644447&amp;pg=PA373 |date=May 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1693, the college was [[university constituency|given a seat]] in the [[House of Burgesses]] and it was determined the college would be supported by [[tobacco]] taxes and export duties on [[fur]]s and animal skins. The college acquired a {{convert|330|acre|km2}} parcel for the new school,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GmbH |first=Sedo |url=http://williamsburgpostcards.com/other/other14a.htm |title=williamsburgpostcards.com |work=williamsburgpostcards.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120043818/http://williamsburgpostcards.com/other/other14a.htm |archivedate=January 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|8|mi|km}} from Jamestown. In 1694, the new school opened in temporary buildings.

[[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] was granted a royal charter as a city in 1722 by [[The Crown]] and served as the capital of Colonial Virginia from 1699 to 1780. During this time, the college served as a law center and lawmakers frequently used its buildings. It educated future U.S. Presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Monroe]], and [[John Tyler]]. The college has been called "the Alma Mater of a Nation" because of its close ties to America's founding fathers. A 17-year-old [[George Washington]] received his surveyor's license through the college and would return as its first American chancellor. William &amp; Mary is famous for its firsts: the first U.S. institution with a royal charter, the first Greek-letter society ([[Phi Beta Kappa]], founded in 1776), the first collegiate society in the country ([[Flat Hat Club|F.H.C. Society]], founded in 1750), the first student honor code and the first [[William &amp; Mary Law School|law school]] in America. The college became a state-supported school in 1906 and became coeducational in 1918. In 1928, [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] chose the College Building as the first building to be returned to its 18th-century appearance as part of the iconic [[Colonial Williamsburg]] restoration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wm.edu/about/history/index.php William &amp; Mary – History &amp; Traditions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415030041/http://www.wm.edu/about/history/index.php |date=April 15, 2016 }}.

During the period of the American Revolution, [[freedom of religion]] was established in Virginia notably with the 1786 passage of the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]]. Future U.S. President [[James Madison]] was a key figure in the transition to religious freedom in Virginia, and [[James Madison (bishop)|Right Reverend James Madison]], his cousin and [[Thomas Jefferson]], who was on the [[Board of Visitors]], helped the College of William &amp; Mary to make the transition as well. In 1779 the college became the first American university with the establishment of the graduate schools in law and medicine.{{clarify|date=March 2016}} As its president, Reverend Madison worked with the new leaders of Virginia, most notably Jefferson, on a reorganization and changes for the college which included the abolition of the Divinity School and the Indian School and the establishment of the first elective system of study and honor system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virginiavignettes.org/?p=21 |title=Virginia Vignettes » What Was the Brafferton School? |publisher=Virginiavignettes.org |date=August 2007 |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111135556/http://www.virginiavignettes.org/?p=21 |archivedate=November 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College of William and Mary is home to the nation's first [[collegiate secret societies in North America|collegiate secret society]], the [[Flat Hat Club|F.H.C. Society]], popularly known as the [[Flat Hat Club]], founded November 11, 1750. On December 5, 1776, students [[John Heath (politician)|John Heath]] and [[William Short (American ambassador)|William Short]] (Class of 1779) founded [[Phi Beta Kappa]] as a secret literary and philosophical society. Other [[Secret societies at the College of William &amp; Mary|secret societies]] known to currently exist at the college include: The [[Seven Society (College of William &amp; Mary)|7 Society]], 13 Club, Alpha Club, [[Bishop James Madison Society]], The Society, The Spades, W Society, and [[Wren Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogstreetjournal.com/story/2049 Shhh!

[[Thomas R. Dew]], professor of history, metaphysics, and political economy, and then President of William &amp; Mary from 1836 until his death in 1846, was an influential academic defender of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1842, alumni of the college formed the Society of the Alumni&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=F. James |last=Barnes, II |url=http://alumni.wm.edu/history/index.shtml |title=William &amp; Mary Alumni &gt; History |publisher=Alumni.wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now the sixth oldest alumni organization in the United States. In 1859, a great fire caused destruction to the College Building. The [[Alumni House (College of William &amp; Mary)|Alumni House]] is one of the few original antebellum structures remaining on campus; notable others include the Wren Building, the President's House, the Brafferton, and Prince George House.

===Civil War, Reconstruction, and the early 20th century===
[[File:Wren 1859 william and mary.jpg|thumb|left|College Building, 1859–1862]]
At the outset of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), enlistments in the [[Confederate States Army]] depleted the student body; and on May 10, 1861, the faculty voted to close the college for the duration of the conflict. The [[Wren Building|College Building]] was used as a Confederate barracks and later as a hospital, first by Confederate, and later Union forces. The [[Battle of Williamsburg]] was fought nearby during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] on May 5, 1862, and the city was captured by the Union army the next day. The [[Brafferton (building)|Brafferton building of the college]] was used for a time as quarters for the commanding officer of the Union garrison occupying the town. On September 9, 1862, drunken soldiers of the [[5th Pennsylvania Cavalry]] set fire to the College Building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/vitalfacts/nineteenth2.php |title=1850–1899 &amp;#124; Historical Facts |work=Historical Chronology of William and Mary |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704205939/http://www.wm.edu/vitalfacts/nineteenth2.php |archivedate=July 4, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; purportedly in an attempt to prevent Confederate snipers from using it for cover. Much damage was done to the community during the Union occupation, which lasted until September 1865.

Following restoration of the Union, Virginia was destitute from the War. The college's 16th president, [[Benjamin Stoddert Ewell]], finally reopened the school in 1869 using his personal funds but the college closed in 1882 due to lack of funds. In 1888, William &amp; Mary resumed operations under a substitute charter when the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] passed an act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swem.wm.edu/departments/special-collections/exhibits/exhibits/charter/normal/ |title=Earl Gregg Swem Library Special Collections |publisher=Swem.wm.edu |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; appropriating $10,000 to support the college as a state teacher-training institution. [[Lyon Gardiner Tyler]] (son of US President and alumnus [[John Tyler]]) became the 17th president of the college following President Ewell's retirement. Tyler, along with 18th president [[J. A. C. Chandler]], expanded the college into a modern institution. In March 1906, the General Assembly passed an act taking over the grounds of the colonial institution, and it has remained publicly supported ever since. In 1918, William &amp; Mary became one of the first universities in Virginia to admit women and become [[coeducational]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/women/grad_prof1.html Women at UVa: Graduate and Professional Schools] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216222951/http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/women/grad_prof1.html |date=February 16, 2015 }}. .lib.virginia.edu. Retrieved on August 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, enrollment increased from 104 students in 1889 to 1269 students by 1932.
[[File:William and Mary College, Williamsburg, Virginia, circa 1902.jpg|thumb|right|The college, c. 1902]]
Largely thanks to the vision of a William and Mary instructor, [[W. A. R. Goodwin|Reverend Dr. W. A. R. Goodwin]], the College Building, the President's House and [[the Brafferton]] (originally the Indian School) were restored to their 18th century appearance between 1928 and 1932 with substantial financial support from [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] and his wife, [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]]. Together, they led the establishment and beginnings of [[Colonial Williamsburg]].

===1930–present===

In 1930, William &amp; Mary expanded its territorial range by establishing a branch in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] – The Norfolk Division of the College of William &amp; Mary. This extension would eventually become the independent state-supported institution known as [[Old Dominion University]].

Significant campus construction continued under the college's nineteenth president, [[John Stewart Bryan]]. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] received an honorary degree from the college on October 20, 1934.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1934/10/21/archives/roosevelts-address-at-william-and-mary.html Roosevelt's Address at William and Mary – Article – NYTimes.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608171651/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10917FF3B5D167A93C3AB178BD95F408385F9 |date=June 8, 2013 }}.

The sunken design is taken from a similar landscape feature at [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] in London, designed by Sir Christopher Wren.

The college has a history of supporting freedom of the press dating back at least to the 1940s. In 1945, for example, the college administration sanctioned the student Marilyn Kaemmerle for an article she had written in ''[[The Flat Hat]]'' supporting the end of [[racist]] policies of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], [[anti-miscegenation laws]] and [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,792051,00.html Education: Jefferson's Heirs]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826034248/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C792051%2C00.html |date=August 26, 2013 }}, ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', February 26, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, in response, over one-thousand William &amp; Mary students held "a spirited mass meeting protesting infringement of the sacred principles of freedom of the press bequeathed by Alumnus Thomas Jefferson." She was pardoned by the college Board of Visitors decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scrc.swem.wm.edu/wiki/index.php/Marilyn_Kaemmerle|title=Marilyn Kaemmerle|work=wm.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309172041/http://scrc.swem.wm.edu/wiki/index.php/Marilyn_Kaemmerle|archivedate=March 9, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college admitted Hulon Willis into a graduate program in 1951 because the program was unavailable at Virginia State. However, the college did not open all programs to African-American students until around 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Desegregation_in_Higher_Education#start_entry|title=Desegregation in Higher Education in Virginia|first=Peter|last=Wallenstein|accessdate=June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, [[The Colleges of William &amp; Mary]], a short-lived five campus university system, was founded. It included the College of William &amp; Mary, the [[Richmond Professional Institute]], the [[Norfolk Division of the College of William &amp; Mary]], [[Christopher Newport College]], and [[Richard Bland College]].&lt;ref name="CoWMAH"&gt;{{cite book|last=Godson|title=The College of William and Mary: A History|year=1993|publisher=King and Queen Press|isbn=0-9615670-4-X|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dissolved in 1962.

In 1974, Jay Winston Johns willed [[Highland (James Monroe house)|Highland]], the {{convert|535|acre|km2|adj=on}} historic [[Albemarle County, Virginia]] estate of alumnus and U.S. President [[James Monroe]], to the college.

A pilot relationship, supported by a $200,000 grant in the Virginia budget, was subsequently agreed upon by both universities to examine this possible union in reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2013/wm-report-recommends-pilot-partnership-with-evms123.php | title=W&amp;M report recommends pilot partnership with EVMS | last=Whitson | first=Brian | publisher=The College of William &amp; Mary | date=January 16, 2013 | accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The college is located on a {{convert|1200|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]. In 2011, [[Travel+Leisure]] named William &amp; Mary one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/24|title="America's most beautiful college campuses", ''Travel+Leisure'' (September 2011)|work=Travel + Leisure|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wren Building|Sir Christopher Wren Building]] is the oldest college building in the United States and a National Historic Landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=707&amp;ResourceType=Building |title=Wren Building, College of William and Mary |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213002246/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=707&amp;ResourceType=Building |archivedate=February 13, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building, colloquially referred to as the "Wren Building", was named upon its renovation in 1931 to honor the English architect [[Sir Christopher Wren]]. The basis for the 1930s name is a 1724 history in which Hugh Jones stated the 1699 design was "first modelled by Sir Christopher Wren" and then was adapted "by the Gentlemen there" in Virginia; little is known about how it looked, since it burned within a few years of its completion. Today's Wren Building is based on the design of its 1716 replacement. The college's alumni association has suggested that Wren's connection to the 1931 building is a viable subject of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Did Wren Design the Building and William and Mary Bearing His Name? |first=Chiles T.A. |last=Larson |journal=William &amp; Mary |page=59 |date=Fall 2005 |volume=71 |issue=1|publisher=W&amp;M Alumni Association|url=http://wmalumnimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vol_71_no_1_WMAlumMag_fall20052.pdf|accessdate=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other buildings around the Wren Building complete a triangle known unofficially as "Ancient Campus": the [[Brafferton (building)|Brafferton]] (built in 1723 and originally housing the Indian School, now the President and Provost's offices) and the President's House (built in 1732). In addition to the "Ancient Campus", which dates to the 18th century, the college also consists of "Old Campus" and "New Campus."

"Old Campus" consists of academic buildings and dormitories built in close proximity to the Wren Building and match the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and Anglo-Dutch architecture of the colonial buildings of "Ancient Campus" and [[Colonial Williamsburg]]. Located directly to the west of the Wren Building, the majority of "Old Campus" was constructed during the 1920s and 1930s and is dominated by the [[Sunken Garden (Virginia)|Sunken Gardens]] and the college's football stadium, [[Zable Stadium]]. Also located within "Old Campus" are Sorority Court, the majority of upperclassmen dormitories, and the offices and classrooms of the History, Economics, Government, Philosophy, Religion, Music, Modern Language, and English Departments.

Adjoining "Old Campus" to the north and west is "New Campus." It was constructed primarily between 1950 and 1980, and it consists of academic buildings and dormitories that, while of the same brick construction as "Old Campus", fit into the vernacular of modern architecture. Beginning with the college's [[tercentenary]] in 1993, the college has embarked on a building and renovation program that favors the traditional architectural style of "Old Campus", while incorporating energy-efficient technologies. Several buildings constructed since the 1990s have been [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED certified]]. Additionally, as the buildings of "New Campus" are renovated after decades of use, several have been remodeled to incorporate more traditional architectural elements in an effort to unify the appearance of the entire college campus. "New Campus" is dominated by [[William and Mary Hall]], [[Earl Gregg Swem Library]], and [[Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall]]. It also includes the offices and classrooms of the Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, Biology, and Chemistry Departments, the majority of freshman dormitories, the fraternity complex, and the majority of the college's athletic fields. The newest addition to "New Campus" is [[Alan B. Miller Hall]], the headquarters of the college's [[Mason School of Business]].

[[File:William and mary lake matoaka ampitheater september 2011.jpeg|thumb|The renovated Matoaka Amphitheater scenically located on the shore of Lake Matoaka.]]

The recent wave of construction at William and Mary has resulted in a new building for the School of Education, located not far from William and Mary Hall. Additionally, new facilities have freed up space in existing structures. The offices and classrooms of the Government, Economics, and Classical Language Departments, which share a building on "New Campus" (Morton Hall), could potentially be separated and some relocated to vacant buildings recently renovated within the "Old Campus".

The vast majority of William and Mary's {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} consists of woodlands and [[Lake Matoaka]], an artificial lake created by colonists in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/as/kecklab/lakematoaka/facts/index.php |title=Facts about Lake Matoaka |publisher=The College of William and Mary |accessdate=May 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513054133/https://www.wm.edu/as/kecklab/lakematoaka/facts/index.php |archive-date=May 13, 2011 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The college has shown a dedication to the stewardship and preservation of these natural elements, which are accessible via the trails running throughout the campus.

The college also has property and buildings not contiguous to campus, including the [[The College of William &amp; Mary Law School|William and Mary School of Law]] and the [[McCormack-Nagelsen Tennis Center]], both located on a piece of property approximately four blocks southeast of the Wren Building. Additionally, approximately a mile northwest of "New Campus" is the Dillard Complex (located across from the modern campus of Virginia's [[Eastern State Hospital (Virginia)|Eastern State Hospital]]), which is home to several offices, two former dormitories, and [[Plumeri Park]], the college's baseball stadium.

The Board of Visitors is a corporation established by the [[General Assembly of Virginia]] to govern and supervise the operation of the College of William &amp; Mary and of [[Richard Bland College]].&lt;ref name="FH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/provost/documents/facultyhandbookAugust2008.pdf |format=PDF |title=Faculty Handbook |year=2008 |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207190242/http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/provost/documents/facultyhandbookAugust2008.pdf |archivedate=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corporation is composed of 17 members appointed by the [[Governor of Virginia]], based upon the recommendations made by the Society of the Alumni, to a maximum of two-successive four-year terms. The Board elects a Rector, Vice Rector, and Secretary and the Board meets four times annually.&lt;ref name="FH"/&gt; The Board is responsible for appointing a president, related administrative officers, and an honorary chancellor, approving degrees, admission policies, departments, and schools, and executing the fiduciary duties of supervising the college's property and finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/bov/members/index.php |title=Members of the Board |publisher=Board of Visitors, The College of William &amp; Mary |accessdate=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chancellor of the College of William and Mary]] is largely a ceremonial role. Until 1776, the position was held by an English subject, usually the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] or the [[Bishop of London]], who served as the college's advocate to the crown, while a colonial President oversaw the day-to-day activities of the Williamsburg campus. Following the Revolutionary War, General [[George Washington]] was appointed as the first American chancellor; later United States President [[John Tyler]] held the post. The college has recently had a number of distinguished chancellors: former [[Chief Justice of the United States]] [[Warren E. Burger]] (1986–1993), former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] (1993–2000), former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] (2000–2005), and former U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] (2005–2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/chancellor/duties/index.php |title=Duties and History, Chancellor |publisher=The College of William and Mary |accessdate=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert M. Gates]], himself an alumnus of the college, succeeded O'Connor in February 2012.&lt;ref name=Ukman2011&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Washington Post]] |title=Gates takes chancellor's post at William and Mary |date=September 6, 2011 |first=Jason |last=Ukman |accessdate=September 6, 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/checkpoint-washington/post/gates-takes-chancellors-post-at-william-and-mary/2011/09/06/gIQA3jKl6J_blog.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Visitors delegates to a president the operating responsibility and accountability for the administrative, fiscal, and academic performance of the college as well as representing the college on public occasions such as conferral of degrees.&lt;ref name="FH"/&gt; [[W. Taylor Reveley III]], 27th President of the college, served from 2008 to 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/president/biography/index.php |title=W. Taylor Reveley, President |publisher=The College of William and Mary |accessdate=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president is assisted by a provost, the senior academic officer of the university, and several vice presidents.

Faculty members are organized into separate faculties of the Faculty of Arts and Science as well as those for the respective schools of [[Mason School of Business|Business]], [[The College of William &amp; Mary School of Education|Education]], [[Marshall-Wythe School of Law|Law]], and [[Virginia Institute of Marine Science]].&lt;ref name="FH"/&gt; Each faculty is presided over by a dean, who reports to the provost, and governs itself through separate by-laws approved by the Board of Visitors. The faculty are also represented by a faculty assembly that serves to advise the president and provost.&lt;ref name="FH"/&gt;

The [[Royal Hospital School]], an independent boarding school in the United Kingdom, is a sister institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Greenwich Hospital School: A Brief History of The Royal Hospital School|publisher=Mariners|date=March 5, 2003 |url=http://www.mariners-l.co.uk/GreenwichRoyal.html|accessdate=February 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These organizations hold events to promote the spread and awareness of different cultures from around the world.

===Honor system===
[[File:Thomas-Jefferson.jpg|upright|thumb|Thomas Jefferson]]
William &amp; Mary's [[Honor code|honor system]] was first established by alumnus [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1779 and is widely believed to be the nation's first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Olsen |first=Patricia R. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/education/edlife/notebook.html |title=And Out of the Corner of My Eye... – New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=January 6, 2008 |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the orientation week, every entering student recites the Honor Pledge in the Great Hall of the [[Wren Building]] pledging:
{{quote|As a Member of the William &amp; Mary community I pledge, on my Honor, not to lie, cheat, or steal in either my academic or personal life. I understand that such acts violate the Honor Code and undermine the community of trust of which we are all stewards.}}

The basis of W&amp;M's Honor Pledge was written over 150 years ago by alumnus and law professor [[Henry St. George Tucker Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=T000398 |title=Tucker, Henry St. George, (1780–1848) |publisher=Biographical Dictionary of the United States Congress |accessdate=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While teaching law at the [[University of Virginia]], Tucker proposed students attach a pledge to all exams confirming on their honor they did not receive any assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barefoot |first=Coy |authorlink= |title=The Evolution of Honor: Enduring Principle, Changing Times |journal=The University of Virginia Magazine |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=22–27 |publisher=University of Virginia Alumni Assn. |location=Charlottesville, Virginia |date=Spring 2008 |url=http://www.uvamagazine.org/site/c.esJNK1PIJrH/b.3888025/ |doi= |id= |accessdate=March 4, 2008 |format=– &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=author%3ABarefoot+intitle%3AThe+Evolution+of+Honor%3A+Enduring+Principle%2C+Changing+Times&amp;as_publication=The+University+of+Virginia+Magazine&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329101500/http://www.uvamagazine.org/site/c.esJNK1PIJrH/b.3888025/ |archivedate=March 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last= Smith | first= C.

The college's Honor System is codified such that students found guilty of cheating, stealing or lying are subject to sanctions ranging anywhere from a verbal warning up to expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/deanofstudents/judicial/Honor_System.php |title=Judicial Affairs &amp;#124; |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609221216/http://www.wm.edu/deanofstudents/judicial/Honor_System.php |archivedate=June 9, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student Code of Conduct===

William and Mary considers the observance of public laws of equal importance to the observance of its own regulations. William and Mary's Board of Visitors delegates authority for discipline to its president. The President oversees a hierarchy of disciplinary authorities to enforce local laws as it pertains to William and Mary's interest as well as its internal regulatory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/studenthandbook/student_code_of_conduct/index.php |title=Student Code of Conduct |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditions===
[[File:Crimdell.jpg|thumb|left|Crim Dell bridge in the heart of W&amp;M's wooded campus]]
William &amp; Mary has a number of traditions, including the Yule Log Ceremony, at which the president dresses as [[Santa Claus]] and reads a rendition of "[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]", the Vice-President of Student Affairs reads "Twas the Night Before Finals", and [[The Gentlemen of the College]] sing the song "[[The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)|The Twelve Days of Christmas]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_59339.asp |title=12/1/2004 – Holiday Traditions Fill The Season In Williamsburg – Travel – Chattanoogan.com |publisher=Chattanoogan.com |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214114143/http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_59339.asp |archivedate=February 14, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas is a grand celebration at the college; decorated Christmas trees abound on campus. This popular tradition in fact started when German immigrant Charles Minnegerode, a humanities professor at the college in 1842 who taught Latin and Greek, brought one of the first Christmas trees to America. Entering into the social life of post-colonial Virginia, Minnigerode introduced the German custom of decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas at the home of law professor [[St. George Tucker]], thereby becoming another of many influences that prompted Americans to adopt the practice at about that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Minnigerode_Charles_1814-1894 Minnigerode, Charles (1814–1894)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801022323/http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Minnigerode_Charles_1814-1894 |date=August 1, 2016 }}. Encyclopedia Virginia. Retrieved on August 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Incoming freshmen participate in Opening Convocation, at which they pass through the entrance of the Wren Building and are officially welcomed as the newest members of the college. Freshmen also have the opportunity, during orientation week, to serenade the president of the college at his home with the [[Our Alma Mater|Alma Mater song]]. The Senior Walk is similar, in that graduating seniors walk through the Wren Building in their "departure" from the college. On the last day of classes, Seniors are invited to ring the bell in the cupola of the Wren Building.

One unofficial tradition is the Triathlon, a set of three tasks completed by many students prior to graduation. These include jumping the wall of the [[Governor's Palace (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Governor's Palace]] in [[Colonial Williamsburg]] after hours (and if so inclined, running through the Boxwood Maze to the Palace itself), streaking through the [[Sunken Garden (Virginia)|Sunken Garden]], and swimming in the [[Crim Dell bridge|Crim Dell]] pond.{{Citation needed|reason=primary source information, uncited claim |date=September 2016}}

William and Mary also takes pride in their connections to their colonial past during Charter Day festivities. Charter Day is technically February 8, based on the date (from the [[Julian Calendar]]) that the Reverend James Blair, first president of the college received the charter from the Court of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] at Kensington Palace in 1693. Past Charter Day speakers have included former US President [[John Tyler]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], and [[Robert Gates]].

A unique tradition at William and Mary is the annual Raft Debate. Described by the college as "...a 'delicate balance of comedy and lecture,' the annual Raft Debate features four W&amp;M faculty members from diverse disciplines, stranded on a desolate island with only a one-person life raft for escape to civilization. Based on the volume of applause, the audience chooses the sole survivor as the professors cajole, plead, pontificate, and resort shamelessly to props and costumes. The quirky event originated in the mid-1900s and was revived during the 2000s by the Graduate Center, the A&amp;S Office of Graduate Studies and Research, and the A&amp;S Graduate Student Association. Faculty participants represent the Humanities, the Social Sciences, or the Natural and Computational Sciences. The Devil's Advocate, who argues sarcastically that none of the academic disciplines are worth saving, has on rare occasion emerged victoriously."

Commencement exercises each year begin with the senior class walking through the Wren Building and across the campus, crossing the Crim Dell bridge, and arriving at William &amp; Mary Hall for the commencement ceremony. The graduating class processes into the arena as the Choir of the College of William &amp; Mary sings the [[William &amp; Mary Hymn]].

===Fraternities and sororities===
{{Main|College of William &amp; Mary fraternity and sorority system}}
William &amp; Mary has a long history of [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities and sororities]] dating back to [[Phi Beta Kappa]], the first "Greek-letter" organization, which was founded there in 1776. Today, Greek organizations play an important role in the college community, along with other social organizations (e.g. theatre and club sports organizations). Overall, about one-third of its undergraduates are active members of 16 national fraternities and 13 sororities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/offices/greeks/who-we-are/chapters/index.php |title=Chapters |publisher=Wm.edu |date=February 4, 2013 |accessdate=June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; William &amp; Mary is also home to several unique non-Greek social fraternities, notably the [[Nu Kappa Epsilon]] music sorority,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/so/nukappaepsilon/aboutnke.html|title=What Exactly is Nu Kappa Epsilon?|accessdate=February 12, 2008}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010 |bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] co-ed service fraternity, the gender-inclusive [[Phi Sigma Pi]] honor fraternity, and the [[Queens' Guard (College of William and Mary)|Queens' Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/so/queensguard/|title=The Queens' Guard Homepage and Pershing Rifles Co.

==Athletics==

{{Main|William &amp; Mary Tribe}}
Formerly known as the "Indians", William &amp; Mary's athletic teams are now known as the "Tribe". The college fields [[NCAA Division I]] teams for men and women in basketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, swimming, tennis, and indoor and outdoor track and field. In addition, there are women's field hockey, lacrosse and volleyball squads as well as men's baseball and football. In the 2004–05 season, the Tribe garnered five [[Colonial Athletic Association]] titles, and it leads the conference with over 80 titles. In that same year, several teams competed in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Championships, with the football team appearing in the [[Division I-AA]] national semifinals. The men's cross country team finished 8th and 5th at the Division I [[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship]] in 2006 and 2009, respectively. The William &amp; Mary men's basketball team is one of four original Division I schools that has never been to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament.

There have been many recent notable athletes who competed for the Tribe. On the men's soccer team, goalkeeper [[Adin Brown]] was a back-to-back [[Division I First-Team All-American (soccer)|NCAA First Team All-American]] in 1998 and 1999. The track program has produced several [[All-America]]ns, including Brian Hyde, an [[Olympic Games|Olympian]] and collegiate record holder in the [[1500 metres|1500-meter run]], and Ed Moran, a gold medalist in the [[5000 metres|5000-meter run]] at the [[2007 Pan American Games]]. The baseball program boasts a handful of current [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] players, including relief pitcher [[Bill Bray]] with the [[Cleveland Indians]] organization, 11 year MLB career Curtis Pride [[Montreal Expos]], [[New York Yankees]], [[Atlanta Braves]], [[Detroit Tigers]], and [[Colorado Rockies]] utility infielder [[Brendan Harris]]. The [[William &amp; Mary Tribe football|football program]] has also produced numerous [[National Football League|NFL]] players and coaches: All-Pro safety [[Darren Sharper]], current [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] head coach [[Mike Tomlin]], cornerback [[Derek Cox]], kicker [[Steve Christie]], long snapper [[Mike Leach (long snapper)|Mike Leach]], [[Walter Payton Award]]-winning quarterback [[Lang Campbell]], wide receiver [[Dominique Thompson]], [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] coaches [[Marv Levy]] and [[Lou Holtz]], and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] linebackers coach [[Mark Duffner]].

In May 2006, the NCAA ruled that the athletic logo, which includes two green and gold feathers, could create an environment that is offensive to the American Indian community, even though the Florida State Seminoles logo and Utah Utes logo were considered unoffensive. The college's appeal regarding the use of the institution's athletic logo to the NCAA Executive Committee was rejected. The "Tribe" nickname, by itself, was found to be neither hostile nor abusive, but rather communicates ennobling sentiments of commitment, shared idealism, community and common cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/news/?id=5338 |title='Tribe' refers to community Nichol states in a report sent to the NCAA &amp;#124; University Relations |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college stated it would phase out the use of the two feathers by the fall of 2007, although they can still be seen prominently painted on streets throughout the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/news/index.php?id=6870 |title=William and Mary to change athletic logo before Fall 2007 &amp;#124; University Relations |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''crop wild relative''' ('''CWR''') is a wild plant closely related to a [[domesticated plant]], whose geographic origins can be traced to regions known as [[Vavilov Center]]s (named for the pioneering [[botanist]] [[Nikolai Vavilov]]).  It may be a wild ancestor of the domesticated plant, or another closely related [[taxon]].

== Overview ==
The wild relatives of crop plants constitute an increasingly important resource for improving agricultural production and for maintaining sustainable agro-ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Bioversity International, (2006). ''Crop wild relatives''. Bioversity International, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FAO, (1998). ''The State of the World’s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture''. FAO, Rome&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FAO, (2008). ''Establishment of a global network for the in situ conservation of crop wild relatives: status and needs''. FAO, Rome&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of anthropogenic climate change and greater ecosystem instability CWRs are likely to prove a critical resource in ensuring food security for the new millennium.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Maxted, N., Ford-Lloyd, B.V. and Kell, S.P., (2008). Crop wild relatives: establishing the context. In: Maxted, N., Ford-Lloyd, B.V., Kell, S.P. Iriondo, J., Dulloo, E. and Turok, J. (eds.) ''Crop Wild Relative Conservation and Use''. Pp. 3-30. CABI Publishing, Wallingford.&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Nikolai Vavilov]], the Russian botanist who first realized the importance of crop wild relatives in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vavilov, N.I., (1926). ''Studies in the origin of cultivated plants''. Institute of Applied Botany and Plant Breeding, Leningrad.&lt;/ref&gt;  Genetic material from CWRs has been utilized by humans for thousands of years to improve the quality and yield of crops. Farmers have used traditional breeding methods for millennia, wild [[maize]] (''Zea mexicana'') is routinely grown alongside maize to promote natural crossing and improve yields. More recently, plant breeders have utilised CWR genes to improve a wide range of crops like [[rice]] (''Oryza sativa''), [[tomato]] (''Solanum lycopersicum'') and grain [[legumes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hajjar R., Hodgkin T. | year = 2007 | title = The use of wild relatives in crop improvement: a survey of developments over the last 20 years | url = | journal = Euphytica | volume = 156 | issue = | pages = 1–13 | doi=10.1007/s10681-007-9363-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CWRs have contributed many useful genes to crop plants, and modern varieties of most major crops now contain genes from their wild relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dempewolf|first=Hannes|last2=Baute|first2=Gregory|last3=Anderson|first3=Justin|last4=Kilian|first4=Benjamin|last5=Smith|first5=Chelsea|last6=Guarino|first6=Luigi|date=2017-05-06|title=Past and Future Use of Wild Relatives in Crop Breeding|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/abstracts/57/3/1070|journal=Crop Science|language=en|volume=57|issue=3|pages=1070–1082|doi=10.2135/cropsci2016.10.0885|issn=0011-183X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, CWRs are wild plants related to socio-economically important species including food, fodder and forage crops, [[medicinal plants]], condiments, ornamental, and forestry species, as well as plants used for industrial purposes, such as oils and fibres, and to which they can contribute beneficial traits. A CWR can be defined as "... a wild plant [[taxon]] that has an indirect use derived from its relatively close genetic relationship to a crop...”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maxted N., Ford-Lloyd B.V., Jury S.L., Kell S.P., Scholten M.A. | year = 2006 | title = Towards a definition of a crop wild relative | url = | journal = Biodiversity and Conservation | volume = 15 | issue = 8| pages = 2673–2685 | doi=10.1007/s10531-005-5409-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation of crop wild relatives ==
[[File:Genetic-Reserve-Syria.jpg|right|thumb|200px| Example of one of the first genetic reserves established to conserve CWRs near Kalakh al Hosn, [[Syria]]]]
CWRs are essential components of natural and agricultural [[ecosystems]] and hence are indispensable for maintaining ecosystem health.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Their conservation and sustainable use is very important for improving agricultural production, increasing [[food security]], and maintaining a healthy environment.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes, J.G., Maxted, N. and Ford-Lloyd, B.V., (2000). ''The ex situ conservation of plant genetic resources''. pp. 1-250. Kluwer, Dordrecht.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Heywood V.H., Dulloo M.E. | year = 2006 | title = In Situ Conservation of Wild Plant Species – a Critical Global Review of Good Practices. IPGRI Technical Bulletin No. 11. IPGRI, Rome; Hoyt, E., (1988). ''Conserving the Wild Relatives of Crops''. IBPGR, IUCN, WWF, Rome; Meilleur, B.A. and Hodgkin, T., (2004).

[[File:Geographic hotspots of distributions of crop wild relatives not represented in genebanks.tif|thumb|left|Geographic hotspots of distributions of crop wild relatives not represented in genebanks]]

The natural populations of many CWRs are increasingly at risk. They are threatened by [[habitat loss]] through the destruction and degradation of natural environment or their conversion to other uses. Deforestation is leading to the loss of many populations of important wild relatives of fruit, nut, and industrial crops. Populations of wild relatives of cereal crops that occur in arid or semi-arid lands are being severely reduced by over grazing and resulting desertification. The growing industrialization of agriculture is drastically reducing the occurrence of CWRs within the traditional agro-ecosystems. The wise conservation and use of CWRs are essential elements for increasing food security, eliminating poverty, and maintaining the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tanksley S.D., [[Susan McCouch|McCouch S.R.]] | year = 1997 | title = Seed banks and molecular maps: Unlocking genetic potential from the wild | url = | journal = Science | volume = 277 | issue = | pages = 1063–1066 | doi=10.1126/science.277.5329.1063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation strategies for CWRs often consider both ''in situ'' and ''ex situ'' conservation.&lt;ref name=CzechCWR&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Taylor, N.G.; Kell, S.P.; Holubec, V.; Parra-Quijano M.; Chobot K.; Maxted N. |title=A systematic conservation strategy for crop wild relatives in the Czech Republic |journal=Diversity and Distributions |date=2017 |volume=23  |issue=4 |pages=448–462 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.12539/full |doi=10.1111/ddi.12539}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are complementary approaches to CWR conservation, since each has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, whilst ''ex situ'' conservation protects CWR (or more correctly, their genes) from threats in the wild, it can limit [[evolution]] and [[adaptation]] to new environmental challenges.

In 2016, 29% of wild relative plant species were completely missing from the world’s genebanks, with a further 24% represented by fewer than 10 samples. Over 70% of all crop wild relative species worldwide were in urgent need of further collecting to improve their representation in genebanks, and over 95% were insufficiently represented with regard to the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. While the most critical priorities for further collecting were found in the Mediterranean and Near East, Western and Southern Europe, Southeast and East Asia, and South America, crop wild relatives insufficiently represented in genebanks are distributed across almost all countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=Castaneda&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Castañeda-Álvarez N.P.; Khoury C.K.; Achicanoy, H.A.; Bernau, V; Dempewolf, H.; Eastwood, R.J.; Guarino, L.; Harker, R.H.; Jarvis, A.; Maxted, N.; Mueller, J.V.; Ramírez-Villegas J, Sosa C.C.; Struik, P.C.; Vincent, H.; Toll, J. |title=Global conservation priorities for crop wild relatives |journal=Nature Plants |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=16022 |doi=10.1038/nplants.2016.22 |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nplants201622}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CWRpolbrief&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Khoury, C.K.; Castañeda-Álvarez, N.P.; Dempewolf, H.; Eastwood, R.J.; Guarino, L.; Jarvis, A.; Struik, P.C. |title=Measuring the state of conservation of crop diversity: a baseline for marking progress toward biodiversity conservation and sustainable development goals |journal=Crop Wild Relatives Policy Brief |date=2016 |volume=  |issue= |pages=6 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10568/74483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CzechCWR" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23063">'''Dinosaur behavior''' is difficult for paleontologists to study since much of paleontology is dependent solely on the physical remains of ancient life. However, trace fossils and paleopathology can give insight into dinosaur behavior. Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their [[habitat]], [[computer simulation]]s of their [[biomechanics]], and comparisons with modern animals in similar [[ecological niche]]s. As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs. Gregarious behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for [[Bird migration|migratory]] purposes, or to provide protection for their young. There is evidence that many types of dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles. The crests and [[Neck frill|frills]] of some dinosaurs, like the [[marginocephalia]]ns, [[theropoda|theropods]] and [[hadrosaurid|lambeosaurines]], may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and [[territory (animal)|territorialism]]. Most dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of [[biomechanics]], in particular, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alexander RM|title=Dinosaur biomechanics|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|volume=273|issue=1596|year=2006|pmid=16822743|pages=1849–1855|pmc=1634776|doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3532}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether [[diplodocid]]s could create [[sonic boom]]s via [[whip]]-like tail snapping,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Goriely A, McMillen T|title=Shape of a cracking whip|year=2002|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=88|issue=24|page=244301|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.244301|pmid=12059302|bibcode=2002PhRvL..88x4301G}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether sauropods could float.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Henderson, D.M.|year=2003|title=Effects of stomach stones on the buoyancy and equilibrium of a floating crocodilian: A computational analysis|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume=81|issue=8|pages=1346–1357|doi=10.1139/z03-122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceratopsian behavior==
[[File:CeratopsianII BW.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Centrosaurine ceratopsids did not fully develop their cranial ornamentation until fully grown. Scott Sampson argues that comparing ceratopsids to modern mammals with a similar lifecycle can yield insight into the socioecology of the ancient horned dinosaurs.]]
Parental care is implied by the fossilized remains of a grouping of ''[[Psittacosaurus]]'' consisting of one adult and 34 juveniles. In this case, the large number of juveniles may be due to communal nesting.&lt;ref name=mengetal2004&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Meng Qingjin |author2=Liu Jinyuan |author3=Varricchio, David J. |author4=Huang, Timothy |author5=Gao Chunling |year=2004 |title=Parental care in an ornithischian dinosaur |journal=Nature |volume=431 |pages=145–146 |doi=10.1038/431145a |pmid=15356619 |issue=7005|bibcode = 2004Natur.431..145M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossil deposits dominated large numbers of ceratopsids from individual species suggest that these animals were at least somewhat social.&lt;ref name="socioecology-abs-263" /&gt; However, the exact nature of ceratopsid social behavior has historically been controversial.&lt;ref name="socioecology-intro-264" /&gt; In 1997, Lehman argued that the aggregations of many individuals preserved in bonebeds originated as local "infestations" and compared them to similar modern occurrences in crocodiles and tortoises.&lt;ref name="socioecology-intro-264" /&gt; Other authors, such as Scott D. Sampson, interpret these deposits as the remains of large "socially complex" herds.&lt;ref name="socioecology-intro-264" /&gt;

Modern animals with mating signals as prominent as the horns and frills of ceratopsians tend to form these kinds of large, intricate associations.&lt;ref name="socioecology-socioecology-267-268" /&gt; Sampson found in previous work that the [[centrosaurine]] ceratopsids did not achieve fully developed mating signals until nearly fully grown.&lt;ref name="socioecology-retarded-270" /&gt; He finds commonality between the slow growth of mating signals in centrosaurines and the extended [[adolescence]] of animals whose social structures are ranked hierarchies founded on age-related differences.&lt;ref name="socioecology-retarded-270" /&gt; In these sorts of groups young males are typically sexually mature for several years before actually beginning to breed, when their mating signals are most fully developed.&lt;ref name="socioecology-correlates-265" /&gt; Females, by contrast do not have such an extended adolescence.&lt;ref name="socioecology-correlates-265" /&gt;

Other researchers who support the idea of ceratopsid herding have speculated that these associations were seasonal.&lt;ref name="socioecology-resource-269" /&gt;  This hypothesis portrays ceratopsids as living in small groups near the coasts during the rainy season and inland with the onset of the dry season.&lt;ref name="socioecology-resource-269" /&gt; Support for the idea that ceratopsids formed herds inland comes from the greater abundance of bonebeds in inland deposits than coastal ones. The migration of ceratopsids away from the coasts may have represented a move to their nesting grounds.&lt;ref name="socioecology-resource-269" /&gt; Many African herding animals engage in this kind of seasonal herding today.&lt;ref name="socioecology-resource-269" /&gt; Herds would also have afforded some level of protection from the chief predators of ceratopsids, [[tyrannosaurids]].&lt;ref name="socioecology-pred-272" /&gt;

==Ornithopod and Parksosaur behavior==
Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the [[Skye|Isle of Skye]] in northwestern [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3255494.stm Dinosaur family tracks] Footprints show maternal instinct after leaving the nest.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Oryctodromeus''===
Based on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as ''[[Oryctodromeus]]'', some herbivorous species seem to have led a partially [[fossorial]] (burrowing) lifestyle.&lt;ref name=VMK07&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Varricchio DJ |author2=Martin AJ |author3= Katsura, Y |last-author-amp=yes |year=2007 |title=First trace and body fossil evidence of a burrowing, denning dinosaur |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |pmid=17374596 |volume=274|issue=1616 |pmc=2176205|pages=1361–1368 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.0443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Iguanodon''===
The first potential evidence of [[herd]]ing behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31&amp;nbsp;''[[Iguanodon]]'' dinosaurs which were then thought to have perished together in [[Bernissart]], [[Belgium]], after they fell into a deep, flooded [[sinkhole]] and drowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yans J |author2=Dejax J |author3=Pons D |author4=Dupuis C |author5=Taquet P |year=2005|title=Implications paléontologiques et géodynamiques de la datation palynologique des sédiments à faciès wealdien de Bernissart (bassin de Mons, Belgique)|journal=Comptes Rendus Palevol|volume=4|issue=1–2|pages=135–150|language=French|doi=10.1016/j.crpv.2004.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hadrosauridae===
Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that [[Hadrosaurid|duck-bills]] (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the [[American bison|American Bison]] or the African [[Springbok]]. [[John R. Horner|Jack Horner's]] 1978 discovery of a ''[[Maiasaura]]'' ("good mother dinosaur") [[nest]]ing ground in [[Montana]] demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among the [[ornithopod]]s.&lt;ref name=HM79&gt;{{cite journal |last=Horner |first=J.R. |year=1979 |title=Nest of juveniles provides evidence of family structure among dinosaurs |journal=Nature |volume=282 |issue=5736 |pages=296–298 |doi=10.1038/282296a0 |last2=Makela |first2=Robert|bibcode = 1979Natur.282..296H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sauropodomorph behavior==
Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in [[Oxfordshire]], England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Day |first=J.J. |year=2002 |title=Sauropod trackways, evolution, and behavior |journal=Science |volume=296 |page=1659|doi=10.1126/science.1070167 |pmid=12040187 |last2=Upchurch |first2=P |last3=Norman |first3=DB |last4=Gale |first4=AS |last5=Powell |first5=HP |issue=5573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is not evidence for specific herd structures.&lt;ref name=JLW05&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Joanna L. |year=2005 |chapter=Steps in understanding sauropod biology |title=The Sauropods: Evolution and Paleobiology |editor=Curry Rogers, Kristina A. |editor2=Wilson, Jeffrey A. |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |pages=252–284 |isbn=0-520-24623-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that [[Patagonia]]n [[titanosaur]]ian sauropods (1997 discovery) nested in large groups.&lt;ref name=LMCetal05&gt;{{cite book |last=Chiappe |first=Luis M. |author2=Jackson, Frankie |author3=Coria, Rodolfo A. |author4= Dingus, Lowell  |year=2005 |chapter=Nesting titanosaurs from Auca Mahuevo and adjacent sites |title=The Sauropods: Evolution and Paleobiology |editor=Curry Rogers, Kristina A. |editor2=Wilson, Jeffrey A. |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |pages=285–302 |isbn=0-520-24623-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the [[sauropodomorpha|prosauropod]] ''[[Massospondylus]]'') was found without teeth, indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur.&lt;ref name="Reiszetal05"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reisz RR, Scott, D Sues, H-D, Evans, DC &amp; Raath, MA|title=Embryos of an Early Jurassic prosauropod dinosaur and their evolutionary significance|journal=Science|volume=309|issue= 5735|pages=761–764|publisher= |location= |year=2005|url= |doi=10.1126/science.1114942|id= |accessdate= | pmid =16051793|bibcode = 2005Sci...309..761R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theropod behavior==
The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as [[pack hunter]]s working together to bring down large prey.&lt;ref name=LG93&gt;{{cite book |last=Lessem |first=Don |author2=Glut, Donald F. |year=1993 |title=The Dinosaur Society's Dinosaur Encyclopedia |chapter=''Allosaurus'' |pages=19–20|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-679-41770-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maxwell&amp;ostrom1995"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/02724634.1995.10011256|last=Maxwell|first=W. D. |year=1995|last2=Ostrom|first2=John |title=Taphonomy and paleobiological implications of ''Tenontosaurus''-''Deinonychus'' associations|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=707–712}}([http://www.vertpaleo.org/publications/jvp/15-707-712.cfm abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204328/http://www.vertpaleo.org/publications/jvp/15-707-712.cfm |date=2007-09-27 }})&lt;/ref&gt; However, this lifestyle is uncommon among the modern relatives of dinosaurs ([[crocodile]]s and other reptiles, and [[bird]]s&amp;nbsp;– [[Harris's Hawk]] is a well-documented exception), and the [[taphonomy|taphonomic]] evidence suggesting pack hunting in such theropods as ''[[Deinonychus]]'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]'' can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern [[diapsid]] predators.&lt;ref name=RB07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roach|first=Brian T. |year=2007 |title=A reevaluation of cooperative pack hunting and gregariousness in ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'' and other nonavian theropod dinosaurs|journal=Bulletin of the Peabody Museum of Natural History |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=103–138 |doi=10.3374/0079-032X(2007)48[103:AROCPH]2.0.CO;2|last2=Brinkman|first2=Daniel L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.&lt;ref name=PC98&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tanke |first=Darren H. |authorlink=Darren Tanke |year=1998 |title=Head-biting behavior in theropod dinosaurs: paleopathological evidence |journal=Gaia |issue=15 |pages=167–184 |url=http://www.mnhn.ul.pt/geologia/gaia/12.pdf |issn=0871-5424 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227134632/http://www.mnhn.ul.pt/geologia/gaia/12.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Bruce Rothschild]] and others published a study examining evidence for [[stress fractures]] in [[theropod]] dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior.&lt;ref name="stress-frac-abs-331" /&gt; Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma they are more likely to be a result of the animal's behavior than fractures obtained during a single injurious event.&lt;ref name="stress-frac-intro-331-332" /&gt; The distribution of stress fractures also has behavioral significance.&lt;ref name="stress-frac-intro-332" /&gt; Stress fractures to the hand are more likely to result from predatory behavior since injuries to the feet could be obtained while running or migrating.&lt;ref name="stress-frac-intro-332" /&gt; In order to identify stress fractures occurring in the feet specifically due to predatory behavior, the researchers checked to see if the toes which bore the greatest portion of the animals weight while in motion also had the greatest percentage of stress fractures.&lt;ref name="stress-frac-discuss-334" /&gt; Since the lower end of the third [[metatarsal]] would contact the ground first while a theropod was running it would have borne the most stress and should be most predisposed to suffer stress factors more frequently.&lt;ref name="stress-frac-discuss-334" /&gt; The lack of such a bias in the examined fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running, like interaction with prey.&lt;ref name="stress-frac-discuss-334" /&gt; They suggested that such injuries could occur as a result of the theropod trying to hold struggling prey with its feet.&lt;ref name="stress-frac-discuss-334" /&gt; Contact with struggling prey is also the likely cause of tendon avulsions found in the forelimbs of ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''.&lt;ref name="stress-frac-discuss-334" /&gt; The authors concluded that the presence of stress fractures provide evidence for "very active" predation-based diets rather than obligate scavenging.&lt;ref name="stress-frac-abs-331" /&gt;

Research based on energetic modelling has also backed up the role of active predatory behaviors in theropods and has effectively ruled out obligate scavenging as a likely strategy.&lt;ref name=kaneetal2016theropod&gt;{{cite_journal |last=Kane |first=A. |year=2016 |title=Body Size as a Driver of Scavenging in Theropod Dinosaurs |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=187 |doi= 10.1086/686094 |last2=Healy |first2= K |last3= Ruxton |first3=GD | last4= Jackson |first4=AL |pages=706–716 |pmid=27172591}}&lt;/ref&gt; However scavenging was still likely to have been an important resource for many theropod with body size playing a key role in its importance. In general, the researchers found that small species, such as coelurosaurs, and species larger than 1000&amp;nbsp;kg, such as an adult ''Tyrannosaurs rex'', would have been poor scavengers. In contrast intermediate sized species, such as ''Dilophosaurus'', were found to have been capable of gaining significant energy though scavenging.&lt;ref name="kaneetal2016theropod"/&gt;

===''Majungasaurus''===
[[Cannibalism (zoology)|Cannibalism]] amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in  Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod ''[[Majungasaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=rogersetal2003&gt;{{cite_journal |last=Rogers |first=Raymond R. |year=2007 |title=Cannibalism in the Madagascan dinosaur ''Majungatholus atopus'' |journal=Nature |volume=422 |issue=6931 |pages=515–518 |doi=10.1038/nature01532 |pmid=12673249 |last2=Krause |first2=DW |last3=Curry Rogers |first3=K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ornithomimid behavior===

====''Sinornithomimus''====
One example of immature dinosaurs forming social groups comes from a site in [[Inner Mongolia]] that has yielded the remains of over twenty ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'', from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud.&lt;ref name=DVetal08sino&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.4202/app.2008.0402|last=Varricchio|first=D.J.|last2=Sereno |year=2008|first2=Paul C.|last3=Xijin|first3=Zhao|last4=Lin|first4=Tan|last5=Wilson|first5=Jeffery A.|last6=Lyon|first6=Gabrielle H. |title=Mud-trapped herd captures evidence of distinctive dinosaur sociality |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=567–578 |url=http://www.app.pan.pl/article/item/app53-567.html |accessdate=2008-12-09 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tyrannosauridae===
Tooth wear patterns hint that complex head shaking behaviors may have been involved in tyrannosaur feeding.&lt;ref name="alberto-tooth-intro-84" /&gt; The partially healed tail of an ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived.&lt;ref name=carpenter1998/&gt;

===Oviraptoridae===
The [[Mongolia]]n [[oviraptoridae|oviraptorid]] ''[[Citipati (dinosaur)|Citipati]]'' was discovered in a [[chicken]]-like [[Avian incubation|brooding]] position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the [[egg (biology)|eggs]] warm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.eb.com/dinosaurs/dinosaurs/BRa.html Oviraptor nesting] ''[[Oviraptor]]'' nests or ''[[Protoceratops]]''?&lt;/ref&gt;

===Troodontidae===
A recently discovered [[Troodontidae|troodont]] fossil demonstrates that some dinosaurs slept with their heads tucked under their arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Xu, X.  |author2=Norell, M.A.|year=2004|title=A new troodontid dinosaur from China with avian-like sleeping posture|journal=Nature|volume=431|pages=838–841|doi=10.1038/nature02898|pmid=15483610|issue=7010|bibcode = 2004Natur.431..838X }}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds.

===Dromaeosauridae===
Primitive [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]] such as ''[[Microraptor]]'' may have been [[arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] (tree-climbing).&lt;ref name="chatterjee2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chatterjee |first=S. |year=2007 |title=Biplane wing planform and flight performance of the feathered dinosaur ''Microraptor gui'' |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104 |pmid=17242354 |issue=5 |pages=1576–1580 |pmc=1780066 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/0609975104v1.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1073/pnas.0609975104 |last2=Templin |first2=R.

The '''Carlo F. Dondena Centre for Research on Social Dynamics''' was established at [[Bocconi University]] in 2006. It aims to promote, coordinate and conduct interdisciplinary [[research]] on [[social dynamics]], with emphasis on medium- and long-term processes and on comparative analysis.

The main areas of interest of the Centre are [[demography]] and the life course, e.g., fertility and family dynamics, intergenerational relationships and ageing, transitions to adulthood, migration, lifelong learning, social networks, medium- and long-range forecasting, labour market and [[social mobility]]; development and social cohesion, e.g., inequality, social norms and economic development, polarization, integration of migrants and second generations; welfare state and public policies, e.g. social policies in comparative perspective, [[Europeanisation]] and regional issues; and [[data]] collection and harmonisation, including creation of a data archive.

Researchers involved in the Centre include [[Demography|demographers]], [[economists]], experts in [[law]], [[Political science|political scientists]], social [[psychologists]], and [[statisticians]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1728">In [[recursive function theory]], '''double recursion''' is an extension of [[primitive recursion]] which allows the definition of non-primitive recursive functions like the [[Ackermann function]].

[[Raphael M. Robinson]] called functions of two [[natural number]] variables ''G''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''x'') double recursive with respect to ''given functions'', if
* ''G''(0,&amp;nbsp;''x'') is a given function of&amp;nbsp;''x''.
* ''G''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0) is obtained by substitution from the function ''G''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;·) and given functions.
* ''G''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) is obtained by substitution from ''G''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''x''), the function ''G''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;·) and given functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Raphael M. Robinson | title=Recursion and Double Recursion | journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | year=1948 | volume=54 | pages=987–93 | url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?verb=Display&amp;version=1.0&amp;service=UI&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183512393&amp;page=record | doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1948-09121-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson goes on to provide a specific double recursive function (originally defined by [[Rózsa Péter]])
* ''G''(0,&amp;nbsp;''x'') = ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1
* ''G''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0) = ''G''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;1)
* ''G''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) = ''G''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''G''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''x''))
where the ''given functions'' are primitive recursive, but ''G'' is not primitive recursive. In fact, this is precisely the function now known as the [[Ackermann function]].

[[File:Eleonora Eduard1.jpg| thumb|[[Eleanor of Castile]], Queen Consort of England 1272–90.]]
The '''Eleanor crosses''' were a series of twelve lavishly decorated stone monuments  topped with tall crosses, of which three survive nearly intact, in a line down part of the east of England. [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] had the crosses erected between 1291 and 1294 in memory of his wife [[Eleanor of Castile]], marking the nightly resting-places along the route taken when her body was transported to London. Several artists worked on the crosses, as the "Expense Rolls" of the Crown show, with some of the work being divided between the main figures, sent from London, and the framework, made locally. "Alexander of Abingdon" and "William of Ireland", both of whom had worked at Westminster Abbey, were apparently the leading sculptors of figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cockerill|first1=Sara|title=Eleanor of Castile: The Shadow Queen|date=2014|publisher=Amberley|page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===The procession===
[[File:Lincoln 171.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Eleanor's viscera in the Angel Choir at [[Lincoln Cathedral]].]]
{{Main|Eleanor of Castile}}
Upon her death in 1290 at [[Harby, Nottinghamshire|Harby]], near the city of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], the body of Queen Eleanor was carried to Lincoln where she was embalmed, probably either at the [[Gilbertine]] [[St. Catherines, Lincoln#St. Catherine's|priory of St Catherine, Lincoln]] in the south of Lincoln, or at the priory of the Dominicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powrie|first1=Jean|title=Eleanor of Castile|date=1990|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[Organ (anatomy)|viscera]], less her heart, were sent to the Angel Choir of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] for burial, where they still rest.  Her body was then sent to London, taking 12 days to reach [[Westminster Abbey]].  The crosses were erected at the places where her funeral procession stopped overnight.

At Westminster she was buried at the feet of her father-in-law King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]. Her heart travelled with the body and was buried in the abbey church at the London Dominicans' priory at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], along with that of her young son [[Alphonso, Earl of Chester]].

===Reasons for construction===
A similar event had taken place in France for the body of King [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in 1271, although his [[memorial cross]]es, unlike Eleanor's, were erected in part as a manifesto for [[canonisation]]; Edward had probably seen similar memorial crosses in France and elsewhere in Europe during his travels.  They were at least in part intended as [[cenotaph]]s to provoke [[chantry chapel|prayers for her soul]] from passers-by and pilgrims&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of St Albans''&lt;/ref&gt;

==The twelve places==
The only three crosses still standing are those at Geddington, Hardingstone, just outside Northampton, and Waltham Cross, although remnants of the lost ones can also be seen at other sites.

[[File:Geddington Eleanor cross.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Geddington cross]]
[[File:QueenEleanorCross.JPG|thumb|right|150px|The Northampton Cross]]
[[File:NorthamptonPlaque.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Plaque recording the history of the Northampton Cross]]

===Lincoln===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|53|12|51|N|00|32|47|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The only remaining piece of the [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] Eleanor cross is in the grounds of [[Lincoln Castle]]. The cross originally stood at [[St. Catherines, Lincoln|St Catherine's]], an area at the end of Lincoln's High Street.

===Grantham===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|52|54|37|N|00|38|25|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
No part survives of the [[Grantham]] Cross in [[Lincolnshire]], though the records of the 18th-century antiquary, [[William Stukeley]], suggest that it featured Eleanor's coats of arms.

===Stamford===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|52|39|22|N|00|29|37|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Only a small marble fragment survives of the [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] Cross in [[Lincolnshire]], a carved rose excavated by [[William Stukeley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamfordmercury.co.uk/letters/Overwhelming-evidence-on-site-of.3242452.jp ''Stamford Mercury'' "Overwhelming evidence on site of Eleanor cross"]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the closure of [[Stamford Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lincolnshire.gov.uk/stamfordmuseum Stamford Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; the carved fragment is displayed in the Discover Stamford area at the town's library. Stukeley's sketch of the top portion of the Stamford Cross, which suggests that it stylistically resembled the Geddington Cross, is preserved in his diaries in the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford. &lt;br/&gt;See below for the modern monument erected by the [[Smith of Derby Group]].

===Geddington===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|52|26|15|N|00|41|07|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Still standing, the [[Geddington]] Cross in [[Northamptonshire]] is the best-preserved of the three survivors. It is unique among the surviving crosses in having a triangular plan, and a taller and more slender profile with a lower tier entirely covered with rosette [[diapering]], instead of the arch-and-gable motif with tracery which appears on both the others; and canopied statues surmounted by a slender hexagonal pinnacle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/ConProperty.57 English Heritage: Geddington's Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardingstone, Northampton===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|52|13|02|N|00|53|50|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The Northampton cross in [[Hardingstone]] in [[Northamptonshire]] is still standing at the edge of [[Delapré Abbey]], on the side of the A508 leading out of Northampton, just north of the junction with the A45; the King stayed nearby at [[Northampton Castle]]. This cross was begun in 1291 by John of Battle. He worked with [[William of Ireland]] to carve the statues: William was paid £3 6s. 8d. per figure.

The cross is octagonal in shape and set upon some steps: the present ones are replacements. It is built in three tiers and originally had a crowning terminal, possibly a cross. It is not known when this became lost.&lt;ref&gt;''The Buildings of England – Northamptonshire''. N [[Pevsner]] (Second edition). {{ISBN|0-300-09632-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local anecdote says that it was knocked off by a low-flying aircraft from a nearby airfield in the Second World War. However the records show that the cross had been lost by 1460 - there is mention of a "headless cross" at the site from where [[Thomas Bourchier (bishop)|Thomas Bourchier]], the Archbishop of Canterbury watched [[Margaret of Anjou]]'s flight following the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/victoriahistoryo03adki#page/2/mode/2up Adkins, W.R.D., ed. ''The Victoria History of the County of Northampton''. -vol iii, p3 (1906)]&lt;/ref&gt; A replacement cross was installed in the first restoration of 1713, but was replaced by the picturesque broken shaft which is seen today by a further restoration in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Salzman|first1=L.F.|title=A History of the County of Northamptonshire Vol 4|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66362|website=British History Online|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cross is referred to in [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain|Tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain]]'', in his report on the Great Fire of Northampton in 1675, "...a townsman being at Queen's Cross upon a hill on the south side of the town, about two miles ({{convert|2|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) off, saw the fire at one end of the town then newly begun, and that before he could get to the town it was burning at the remotest end, opposite where he first saw it."

Its bottom tier features open books.  These probably included painted inscriptions of Eleanor's biography and of prayers for her soul to be said by viewers, now lost.

===Stony Stratford===
&lt;small&gt;(plaque at {{Coord|52|03|32|N|00|51|24|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;

The [[Stony Stratford]] Cross in [[Buckinghamshire]] stood at the lower end of the town, towards the [[River Great Ouse|River Ouse]], on [[Watling Street]] (now the High Street), although its exact location is hotly debated. It is said to have been of a tall elegant design (perhaps similar to that at Geddington); it was destroyed during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] by the Parliamentarians. The base survived for some time, but any trace has vanished. This commemorative plaque on the wall of 157 High Street is all that is now visible, and reads:

"Near this spot stood the Cross erected by King Edward the I to mark the place in Stony Stratford where the body of Queen Eleanor rested on its way from Harby in Nottinghamshire to Westminster Abbey in 1290"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/mkm/stonystratford/docs/eleanor.html Stony Stratford's Eleanor Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woburn===
&lt;small&gt;(approximately at {{Coord|51|59|20|N|00|37|10|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;

Work on the [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]] Cross in [[Bedfordshire]] started in 1292, later than most of the others. A great part of the work was done by one Ralph de Chichester. No part survives. The precise location is unknown.

===Dunstable===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|53|10|N|00|31|16|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;

Eleanor's coffin was guarded by Canons in [[Dunstable Priory]] whilst local people mourned at the crossroads in [[Dunstable]] in [[Bedfordshire]], the location where the original cross was then constructed. A shopping precinct in High Street North now contains a modern cross statue in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;

===St Albans===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|45|04|N|00|20|26|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The [[St Albans]] Cross in [[Hertfordshire]] was erected in the Market Place at a cost of £100. It stood for many years in front of the fifteenth-century [[Clock Tower, St Albans|Clock Tower]] in the High Street (opposite the Waxhouse Gateway entrance to the [[St Albans Cathedral|Abbey]]), and was demolished in the early eighteenth century due to neglect, and replaced by the town pump. A fountain was erected in its stead in 1874, which was subsequently relocated to Victoria Place.

===Waltham (now Waltham Cross)===
[[File:Waltham Cross.JPG|thumb|The Eleanor Cross at Waltham Cross:  Erected  in 1294 and still intact.]]
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|41|09|N|00|01|59|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The [[Waltham Cross]] monument in [[Hertfordshire]] was constructed in co-operation between an architect and a sculptor: Roger of Crundale, who was the senior royal mason, and Master [[Alexander of Abingdon]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/stories/sadrei_eleanorcross.html Image of the cross at Waltham.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is still standing, although it has been restored on several occasions, and the original statues of Eleanor were replaced by replicas during the last major restoration in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowewood.com/tag/eleanor-cross#post-271 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002090538/http://www.lowewood.com/tag/eleanor-cross#post-271 |date=2 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original statues were kept for some years at Cheshunt Public Library; but they were removed, possibly in the 1980s, to the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]].

===Westcheap (now Cheapside)===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|30|51|N|00|05|41|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Fragments of the [[Cheapside]] Cross in the [[City of London]] are held by the [[Museum of London]], but although a number of drawings of the cross – and of its destruction – survive, they post-date an extensive restoration, or even rebuilding, under [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], and thus provide no safe indication of how the original looked.  It is likely, however, that it was similar to the Waltham and Hardingstone Crosses, but even more ornate and boasting some marble facings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cockerill|first1=Sara|title=Eleanor of Castile: The Shadow Queen|date=2014|publisher=Amberley|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cheapside Cross was demolished in May 1643 under an ordinance from the Parliamentary Committee for the Demolition of Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry, led by [[Robert Harley (1579-1656)|Sir Robert Harley]]. The cross was the third incarnation of the monument, which had been reconstructed and refurbished several times in the preceding three centuries, in which time it had enjoyed the protection of various monarchs and the Mayor and Corporation of London.

Matters came to a head during the years running up to the [[English Civil War]], when the cross was seen to encompass the doctrinal debates of the period. To puritanical reformers, it was identified with '[[Dagon]]', the ancient god of the Philistines, and was seen as the embodiment of Royal Catholic tradition. At least one riot was fought in its shadow as opponents of the cross descended upon it to pull it down, and supporters rallied to stop them.

After [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had fled London to raise an army at the start of the Civil War, the destruction of the cross was almost the first order of business for Harley's commission. Though less well known than the Charing Cross, the downfall of the Cheapside Cross is one of the most interesting and arguably important examples of [[iconoclasm]] in English history.

Fragments of this cross are displayed in the [[Museum of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander, Binski|title=Age of Chivalry|year=1987|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charing (now Charing Cross)===

[[File:2005-07-10 - United Kingdom - England - London - Charing Cross - Eleanor cross.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up of the Victorian cross]]

&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|30|26|N|00|07|39|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;

The cross at [[Charing Cross]] in [[Westminster]], in what was then the [[Royal Mews]], was the most expensive, built of marble in co-operation between an architect, Richard of Crundale, who was the senior royal mason, and a sculptor, Master [[Alexander of Abingdon]].

According to [[folk etymology]], the name Charing derives from French ''{{lang|fr|chère reine}}'' (dear queen),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Eleanor Crosses|url=http://archive.museumoflondon.org.uk/medieval/People/147014/|work=Eleanor of Castille|publisher=[[Museum of London]]|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the name probably came from the Anglo-Saxon word ''{{lang|ang|ċerring}}'', meaning a bend, as it stands on the outside of a 90-degree bend in the River Thames (see [[Charing]] in Kent). The original cross stood at the top of [[Whitehall]] on the south side of [[Trafalgar Square]], but was destroyed on the orders of Parliament in 1647 during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], and was replaced by an equestrian statue of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1675 following the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]]. This point in Trafalgar Square is regarded as the official centre of London in legislation and when measuring distances from London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/08/15/charingcross_feature.shtml Where Is The Centre Of London?] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replicas and imitations==
During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries several replica Eleanor Crosses were erected, including at [[Ilam, Staffordshire|Ilam]] in Staffordshire, [[Walkden]] in Lancashire, and the [[Eleanor Cross, Sledmere]] in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]].

The most substantial of these is in London, outside Charing Cross railway station. Erected in 1865, a few hundred yards to the east of the original site of the Eleanor Cross, on the [[Strand, London|Strand]], it is not a faithful copy, being more ornate than the original. It stands {{convert|70|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and was commissioned by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] Company for their newly opened Charing Cross Hotel. The new cross was designed by the architect of the hotel, [[Edward Middleton Barry|E. M. Barry]], who is best known for his work on [[Covent Garden]]. It was constructed by [[Thomas Earp (sculptor)|Thomas Earp]] of Lambeth from [[Portland stone]], [[Mansfield]] stone (a fine sandstone) and [[Aberdeen granite]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/7219.aspx "Charing Cross"]. Network Rail. Retrieved 22 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was restored to a substantial extent between October 2009 and July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-10911029|title=Renovated Eleanor's Cross in Charing Cross unveiled|date=9 August 2010|work=News London|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Queen Victoria Monument, Birkenhead]] [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]], Merseyside, unveiled in 1905, is in the form of an Eleanor cross. The Ilam cross was built in 1840 by Jesse Watts Russell of [[Ilam Hall]] to commemorate his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thornber.net/staffs/html/ilam.html Ilam photograph]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Glastonbury Market Cross]] resembles an Eleanor cross.

The start of the 21st century was marked in Stamford by erecting a modern monument inspired by the lost Cross. It stands in Sheepmarket, rather than at the original location. The carved detail is based on the fragment in Stamford Museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3259">'''Embedment''' is a phenomenon in [[mechanical engineering]] in which the surfaces between mechanical members of a loaded joint embed.  It can lead to failure by fatigue as described below, and is of particular concern when considering the design of critical [[Bolted joint|fastener joints]].

==Mechanism==
The mechanism behind embedment is different from [[Creep (deformation)|creep]].  When the loading of the joint varies (e.g. due to [[vibration]] or [[thermal expansion]]) the protruding points of the imperfect surfaces will see local stress concentrations and yield until the stress concentration is relieved.  Over time, surfaces can flatten an appreciable amount in the order of thousandths of an inch.

==Consequences==
In critical fastener joints, embedment can mean loss of [[Preload (engineering)|preload]].  Flattening of a surface allows the strain of a screw to relax, which in turn correlates with a loss in tension and thus preload.  In bolted joints with particularly short [[grip length]]s, the loss of preload due to embedment can be especially significant, causing complete loss of preload.  Therefore, embedment can lead directly to loosening of a fastener joint and subsequent [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] failure.

In bolted joints, most of the embedment occurs during torquing.  Only embedment that occurs after installation can cause a loss of preload, and values of up to 0.0005&amp;nbsp;inches can be seen at each surface mate, as reported by SAE.{{Citation needed|reason=the numbers, also use ft to m, so the numbers are given in international recoginzed format|date=July 2008}}

==Prevention/Solutions==
Embedment can be prevented by designing mating surfaces of a joint to have high surface [[hardness]] and very smooth [[surface roughness|surface finish]].  Exceptionally hard and smooth surfaces will have less susceptibility to the mechanism that causes embedment.

In most cases, some degree of embedment is inevitable.  That said, short grip lengths should be avoided.  For two bolted joints of identical design and installation, except the second having a longer grip length, the first joint will be more likely to loosen and fail.  Since both joints have the same loading, the surfaces will experience the same amount of embedment.  However, the relaxation in strain is less significant to the longer grip length and the loss in preload will be minimized.  For this reason, bolted joints should always be designed with careful consideration for the grip length.

If a short grip length can not be avoided, the use of conical spring washers ([[Belleville washer]]s or disc springs) can also reduce the loss of bolt pre-load due to embedment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7397">'''Aletheic relativism''' argues that truth itself is relative. This form of relativism has its own particular problem, regardless of whether one is talking about truth being relative to the individual, the position or purpose of the individual, or the conceptual scheme within which the truth was revealed. This problem centers on what Mandelbaum (1962) termed the "self-excepting fallacy." Largely because of the self-excepting fallacy, few authors in the philosophy of science currently accept aletheic cognitive relativism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muncy|first=James A.|last2=Fisk|first2=Raymond P.|date=1987|title=Cognitive Relativism and the Practice of Marketing Science|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1251141|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=51|issue=1|pages=20–33|doi=10.2307/1251141}}&lt;/ref&gt;. '''Factual relativism''' (also called '''epistemic relativism''', '''epistemological relativism''', '''alethic relativism''' or '''cognitive relativism''') is a way to [[reasoning|reason]] where [[fact]]s used to [[theory of justification|justify]] any [[proposition|claim]]s are understood to be [[relativism|relative]] and [[subjectivism|subjective]] to the perspective of those [[evidence|proving]] or [[falsify]]ing the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Iris Einheuser, [http://www.ub.edu/grc_logos/archive/conferences/relativismabouttruth/Abstract5(Einheuser).pdf "Varieties of Relativism: Indexical, Propositional and Factual"], from the Logos conference on RELATIVIZING UTTERANCE TRUTH, Barcelona, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewpoints==
One school of thought compares scientific knowledge to the mythology of other cultures, arguing that it is merely our society's set of myths based on societal assumptions. For support, [[Paul Feyerabend]]'s comments in ''[[Against Method]]'' that "The similarities between science and myth are indeed astonishing" and "First-world science is one science among many" (from the introduction to the Chinese edition)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feyerabend|first=Paul|title=Against method|date=1992|publisher=Verso|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780860916468|page=3|edition=Repr}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes cited, although it is not clear if Feyerabend meant them to be taken entirely seriously.

The [[strong program]] in the [[sociology of science]] is (in the words of founder [[David Bloor]]) "impartial with respect to truth and falsity".&lt;ref name="Philosophy Science"&gt;{{cite web|title=PhilosophyScience2|url=http://www3.dbu.edu/mitchell/philosophyscience2.htm|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Bloor and [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]] have said "For the relativist [such as us] there is no sense attached to the idea that some standards or beliefs are really rational as distinct from merely locally accepted as such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rationality and relativism|date=1982|publisher=MIT press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262580618|pages=27–28|editor1=Hollis, Martin |editor2=Lukes, Stephen }}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, [[Bruno Latour]] has claimed that "Since the settlement of a controversy is the ''cause'' of Nature's representation, not the consequence, we can never use the outcome&amp;nbsp;– Nature&amp;nbsp;– to explain how and why a controversy has been settled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Latour|first=Bruno|title=Science in action : how to follow scientists and engineers through society|date=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674792913|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yves Winkin, a Belgian professor of communications, responded to a popular trial in which two witnesses gave contradicting testimony by telling the newspaper ''Le Soir'' that "There is no transcendent truth. [...] It is not surprising that these two people, representing two very different professional universes, should each set forth a different truth. Having said that, I think that, in this context of public responsibility, the commission can only proceed as it does."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sokal|first=Alan|title=Fashionable nonsense&amp;nbsp;: postmodern intellectuals' abuse of science|date=1998|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=9781466862401|page=100|author2=Bricmont, Jean }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher of science Gérard Fourez wrote in that "What one generally calls a fact is an interpretation of a situation that no one, at least for the moment, wants to call into question."&lt;ref&gt;Fourez, Gérard (1992). ''La Construction des sciences, 2eme edition revue''. Brussels:De Boeck Université.&lt;/ref&gt;

British archaeologist Roger Anyon told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "science is just one of many ways of knowing the world...  The [[Zuni people|Zuni]]'s world view is just as valid as the archeological viewpoint of what prehistory is about."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Johnson (writer)|Johnson, George]].

== Criticism ==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Cognitive relativism is unfalsifiable and has been criticized by both [[Analytic Philosophy|analytic philosophers]] and [[Science|scientists]].

Cosmologist [[Stephen Hawking]] in ''[[The Grand Design (book)|The Grand Design]]'' has advocated [[model-dependent realism]], which bears close resemblance to a relativist position, as a means of reconciling apparent inconsistencies between different iterations of [[M-Theory]].

[[Larry Laudan]]'s book ''Science and Relativism''&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Relativism: Dialogues on the Philosophy of Science'', {{ISBN|978-0-226-46949-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines the various philosophical points of view on the subject in the form of a dialogue.

'''Gamelan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|æ|m|ə|l|æ|n}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=John|authorlink=John C.

The most common instruments used are [[metallophone]]s played by mallets and a set of hand-played drums called ''[[kendhang]]'' which register the [[beat (music)|beat]]. Other instruments include [[xylophone]]s, [[bamboo flute]]s, a [[string instrument|bowed instrument]] called a ''[[rebab]]'', and even vocalists called ''[[sindhen]]''.&lt;!--Instruments are built and tuned to stay together&amp;nbsp;– as a result, instruments from different gamelans are generally not interchangeable.--&gt;&lt;ref name=sumarsam&gt;Sumarsam (1998). [http://sumarsam.web.wesleyan.edu/Intro.gamelan.pdf ''Introduction to Javanese Gamelan'']. Middletown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the popularity of gamelan has declined since the introduction of pop music, gamelan is still commonly played on formal occasions and in many traditional Indonesian ceremonies. For most Indonesians, gamelan is an integral part of [[Indonesian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Bramantyo Prijosusilo, '[http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/commentary/indonesia-needs-the-harmony-of-the-gamelan/423530 Indonesia needs the Harmony of the Gamelan'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115102945/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/commentary/indonesia-needs-the-harmony-of-the-gamelan/423530 |date=2013-01-15 }}, ''The Jakarta Globe'', 22 February 2011. {{verification needed|date=June 2014|reason=Article states that gamelan "once was so much a part of community life" that each village had a set, but at most refers to its relative loss of importance today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The word '''''gamelan''''' comes from the [[Javanese language#Registers|low Javanese]] word ''gamel'', which may refer to a type of mallet used to strike instruments or the act of striking with a mallet.&lt;ref name=sumarsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindsay"&gt;Lindsay, Jennifer (1992). ''Javanese Gamelan'', p.10. {{ISBN|0-19-588582-1}}.&lt;!--ibid later--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''''karawitan''''' refers to classical gamelan music and performance practice, and comes from the word ''rawit'', meaning 'intricate' or 'finely worked'.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt; The word derives from the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] word of [[Sanskrit]] origin, ''rawit'', which refers to the sense of smoothness and elegance idealized in Javanese music. Another word from this root, ''pangrawit'', means a person with such sense, and is used as an honorific when discussing esteemed gamelan musicians. The high Javanese word for ''gamelan'' is '''''gangsa''''', formed either from the words ''tembaga'' and ''rejasa'' referring to the materials used in bronze gamelan construction (copper and tin), or ''tiga'' and ''sedasa'' referring to their proportions (three and ten).&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay (1992), p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Musician Borobudur.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Musicians performing musical ensemble, bas-relief of [[Borobudur]]]]
[[File:Gong and Chime Culture Map.jpg|thumb|right|The three major indigenous genres of gong-chime music prevalent in Southeast Asia: this includes the ''gamelan'' of western Indonesia; the ''[[kulintang]]'' of the southern Philippines, eastern Indonesia, and eastern Malaysia; and the ''[[piphat]]'' of Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Burma]]
&lt;!--[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gamelanorkest TMnr 60015940.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Gamelan orchestra (1870-1891)]]--&gt;
The gamelan predates the [[Indianized kingdoms|Hindu-Buddhist culture]] that dominated Indonesia in its earliest records and thus represents an indigenous art form. In contrast to the heavy [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] influence in other art forms, the only obvious [[Music of India|Indian influence]] in gamelan music is in the Javanese style of singing, and in the themes of the [[Wayang kulit]] (shadow puppet plays).&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Javanese mythology, the gamelan was created by Sang Hyang Guru in [[Saka era]] 167 (c. AD 230), the god who ruled as king of all Java from a palace on the Maendra mountain in [[Medang Kamulan]] (now [[Mount Lawu]]). He needed a signal to summon the gods and thus invented the gong. For more complex messages, he invented two other gongs, thus forming the original gamelan set.&lt;ref&gt;R.T. Warsodiningrat, ''Serat Weda Pradangga''. Cited in Roth, A. R. ''New Compositions for Javanese Gamelan''. University of Durham, Doctoral Thesis, 1986. Page 4.&lt;!--ibid later--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest image of a musical ensemble is found on the bas-relief of 8th century Buddhist monument of [[Borobudur]], Central Java.&lt;ref name="ThoughtCo-Gamelan"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-gamelan-195131|title=Learn the History Behind Gamelan, Indonesian Music and Dance|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Borobudur's musicians play [[lute]]-like stringed instruments, ''[[kendang]]'' drums, ''[[suling]]'' flutes, small [[cymbal]]s and bells. Some of these musical instruments are indeed included in a complete gamelan orchestra. Musical instruments such as the bamboo flute, bells, drums in various sizes, lute, and bowed and plucked string instruments were identified in this image. However it lacks metallophones and xylophones. Nevertheless, the image of this musical ensemble is suggested to be the ancient form of the gamelan.

The instruments developed into their current form during the [[Majapahit Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia, ''Bulletin for National Museum of Canada'' (Ottawa: April 1961), p.2, cited in Donald A. Lentz. ''The Gamelan Music of Java and Bali: An Artistic Anomaly Complementary to Primary Tonal Theoretical Systems''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1965. Page 5.&lt;!--ibid later--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the inscriptions and manuscripts dated from the Majapahit period, the kingdom even had a government office in charge of supervising the performing arts, including the gamelan. The arts office oversaw the construction of musical instruments, as well as scheduling performances at the court.&lt;ref name="ThoughtCo-Gamelan"/&gt;

In the palaces of [[Java]] the oldest known ensembles, Gamelan ''[[Munggang]]'' and ''Gamelan Kodok Ngorek'', are apparently from the 12th century. These formed the basis of a "loud style" of music. In contrast, a "soft style" developed out of the ''[[kemanak]]'' tradition and is related to the traditions of singing [[Javanese poetry]], in a manner  often believed to be similar to the chorus that accompanies the modern ''[[bedhaya]]'' dance. In the 17th century, these loud and soft styles mixed, and to a large extent the variety of modern gamelan styles of Bali, Java, and Sunda resulted from different ways of mixing these elements. Thus, despite the seeming diversity of styles, many of the same theoretical concepts, instruments, and techniques are shared between the styles.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 4–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
A gamelan is a multi-timbre ensemble consisting of metallophones, xylophones, flutes, gongs, voices, as well as bowed and plucked strings. The hand-played drum called ''kendhang''  controls the tempo and rhythm of pieces as well as transitions from one section to another, while one instrument gives melodic cues to indicate treatment or sections of a piece. Some of the instruments that make up a gamelan in present-day Central Java are shown below:&lt;ref name=drummond&gt;Drummond, Barry.

==Varieties==
{{See also|List of gamelan varieties}}
Varieties of gamelan are distinguished by their collection of instruments and use of voice, tunings, repertoire, style, and cultural context. In general, no two gamelan ensembles are the same, and those that arose in prestigious courts are often considered to have their own style and tuning. Certain styles may also be shared by nearby ensembles, leading to a regional style.

The varieties are generally grouped geographically, with the principal division between the styles favored by the [[Balinese people|Balinese]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], and [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] peoples. The Madurese also had their own style of gamelan, although it is no longer in use, and the last orchestra is kept at the Sumenep palace.&lt;ref&gt;''Across Madura Strait: the dynamics of an insular society'', edited by Kees van Dijk, Huub de Jonge and Elly Touwen-Bouwsma.{{full citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=missing year and page}}&lt;/ref&gt; One important style of Sundanese gamelan is  ''[[Gamelan Degung]]'', which uses a subset of gamelan instruments with a particular mode of ''[[pelog]]'' scale. Balinese gamelan is often associated with the virtuosity and rapid changes of tempo and dynamics of ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar]]'', its best-known style. Other popular Balinese styles include ''[[Kecak]]'', a theatrical dance and music form also known as the "monkey chant." Javanese gamelan, largely dominated by the courts of the 19th century central Javanese rulers, each with its own style,  is known for a slower, more meditative quality than the gamelan music of Bali.  Javanese gamelan can be made from iron or brass; instruments  made of cast bronze are considered the best quality.

Outside the main core on [[Java]] and [[Bali]], gamelan has spread through migration and cultural interest, new styles sometimes resulting as well. [[Malay Gamelan]] comes from the Javanese tradition through Riau-Lingga which later formed its own distinct identity,  using fewer instruments tuned in a near-equidistant ''slendro'', and often using a western B{{music|b}} or C as a tuning basis. Javanese emigrants to Suriname play gamelan in a style close to that found in Central Javanese villages.  Gamelan is also related to the [[Filipino people|Filipino]] ''[[kulintang]]'' ensemble. The variety of gamelan can befound in over 25 countries outside Indonesia, presenting both traditional and experimental repertoire.

In oral Javanese culture distinctions are made between complete or incomplete, archaic and modern, and large standard and small village gamelan. The various archaic ensembles are distinguished by their unique combinations of instruments and possession of obsolete instruments such as the bell-tree (''byong'') in the 3-toned ''gamelan kodhok ngorek''. Regionally variable village gamelan are often distinguished from standard gamelan (which have the ''rebab'' as the main melodic instrument) by their inclusion of a double-reed wind (''selompret'', ''slompret'', or ''sompret'') in addition to variable drum and gong components, with some also including the shaken bamboo ''angklung''.&lt;ref&gt;Kartomi, Margaret (1990).

==Cultural context==
[[File:Javanese Gamelan.jpg|thumb|left|360px|Javanese gamelan ensemble with two female ''[[sindhen]]'' (choral singer) during traditional Javanese wedding at Sasono Utomo, [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]], [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]

In Indonesia, gamelan often accompanies dance, ''[[wayang]]'' puppet performances, or rituals and ceremonies. Typically players in the gamelan will be familiar with dance moves and poetry, while dancers are able to play in the ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of dance in Central Java in [[Surakarta]], see Ganug Nugroho Adi, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/30/dancing-mangkunegara.html Dancing at the Mangkunegara'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 30 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[wayang]]'', the ''[[dhalang|dalang]]'' (puppeteer) must have a thorough knowledge of gamelan, as he gives the cues for the music. Gamelan can be performed by itself&amp;nbsp;– in "''klenengan''" style, or for radio broadcasts&amp;nbsp;– and concerts presentation are common in national arts conservatories founded in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Simon, et al., eds. ''World Music: The Rough Guide''. London: The Rough Guides, 1994. {{ISBN|1-85828-017-6}}. Page 419–420.&lt;!--ibid later--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Gamelan's role in rituals is so important that there is a Javanese saying, "It is not official until the gong is hung".&lt;ref name="B420"&gt;Broughton, 420&lt;/ref&gt; Some performances are associated with royalty, such as visits by the [[sultan of Yogyakarta]]. Certain gamelans are associated with specific rituals, such as the ''[[Gamelan Sekaten]]'', which is used in celebration of ''[[Mawlid an-Nabi]]'' ([[Muhammad]]'s birthday). In [[Bali]], almost all religious rituals include gamelan performance. Gamelan is also used in the ceremonies of the [[Catholicism in Indonesia|Catholic church in Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, 45&lt;/ref&gt; Certain pieces are designated for starting and ending performances or ceremonies. When an "ending" piece (such as "[[Udan Mas]]") is begun, the audience will know that the event is nearly finished and will begin to leave. Certain pieces are also believed to possess magic powers, and can be used to ward off evil spirits.&lt;ref name="B420"/&gt;

Gamelan is frequently played on the radio. For example, the ''[[Pura Pakualaman]]'' gamelan performs live on the radio every ''Minggu Pon'' (a day in the 35-day cycle of the [[Javanese calendar]]).&lt;ref name="B420"/&gt; In major towns, the [[Radio Republik Indonesia]] employs professional musicians and actors, and broadcast programs of a wide variety of gamelan music and drama.&lt;ref name="B421"&gt;Broughton, 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the court tradition of central [[Java]], gamelan is often played in the ''[[pendopo]]'', an open pavilion with a cavernous, double-pitched roof, no side walls, and a hard marble or tile floor. The instruments are placed on a platform to one side, which allows the sound to reverberate in the roof space and enhances the acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 17&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bali Lion Dance.jpg|thumb|240x240px|Gamelan ensemble (or [[Beleganjur|gambelan]] in Balinese term) accompanying [[Barong (mythology)|barong]] performance (Bali [[lion dance]]) at [[Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park|Garuda Wisnu Kencana cultural complex]].]]
In [[Bali]], the Gamelan instruments are all kept together in a ''balé'', a large open space with a roof over the top of it and several open sides. Gambelan (the [[Balinese language|Balinese]] term) are owned by a ''[[banjar (Bali)|banjar]]'', nobility or temples and kept in their respective compounds.

In case of ''banjar'' ownership the instruments are all kept there together because people believe that all the instruments belong to the community as a whole and that no one person has ownership over an instrument.  Not only is this where the instruments are stored, but this is also the practice space for the ''sekaha'' (Gamelan orchestra group). The open walls allow for the music to flow out into the community where the rest of the people may enjoy it. Balinese gamelan cannot be heard inside closed rooms, because it easily crosses the [[Threshold of pain#In hearing|threshold of pain]]. This does not apply to small ensembles like a gamelan ''[[gendér]]''.

The ''sekaha'' is led by a single instructor whose job it is in the community to lead this group and to come up with new pieces. When they are working on a new piece, the instructor will lead the group in practice and help the group form the new music as they are practicing. When the instructor creates a new song, he leaves enough open for interpretation that the group can improvise, so the group will write the music as they practice it.

There are many styles in Balinese gamelan. ''[[Kebyar]]'' is one of the most recent ones. Some Balinese gamelan groups constantly change their music by taking older pieces they know and mixing them together, as well as trying new variations of the music. Their music constantly changes because they believe that music should grow and change; the only exception to this is with their most sacred songs which they do not change. A single new piece of music can take several months before it is completed.

Men and women usually perform in separate groups, with the exception in Java of the ''[[pesindhen]]'', the female singer who performs with male groups.&lt;ref name="B421"/&gt;

In the twenty-five countries outside Indonesia that have gamelan, music performed in a concert context or as part of ceremonies for expat communities&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.balipuspa.de/Kuningan%20im%20rjm.htm Kuningan: Ein Balinesisches Kulturfest]", ''BaliPusa.de''. (German)&lt;/ref&gt; may also accompany [[Indonesian dance|dance]] or ''[[wayang]]''.

==Tuning==
[[File:165 Museu de la Música, gamelan.jpg|thumb|Gamelan in [[Museu de la Música de Barcelona]]]]
[[File:Traditional indonesian stringed instrument.jpg|thumb|''[[Celempung]]''&amp;nbsp;– Indonesian Embassy in [[Canberra]]]]

The tuning and construction of a gamelan orchestra is a complex process.&lt;ref&gt;Ganug Nugroho Adi, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/07/ki-saroyo-gamelan-making-maestro.html Ki Sarojo: Gamelan-making maestro'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 7 June 2012; Ganug Nugroho Adi, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/07/11/forging-gamelan-central-java.html Forging gamelan in Central Java'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 11 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Javanese gamelan use two [[musical tuning|tuning systems]]: ''[[sléndro]]'' and ''[[pélog]]''. There are other tuning systems such as ''[[degung]]'' (exclusive to Sunda, or West Java), and ''[[madenda]]'' (also known as ''diatonis'', similar to a European [[natural minor scale]]). In central Javanese gamelan, ''sléndro'' is a system with five [[Musical note|note]]s to the [[octave]], with large intervals, while ''pélog'' has seven notes to the octave, with uneven [[interval (music)|intervals]], usually played in five note subsets of the seven-tone collection.  A full gamelan will include a set of instruments in each tuning, and classically only one tuning is used at a time. The precise tuning used differs from ensemble to ensemble, and gives each ensemble its own particular flavour. A set of gamelan instruments will be tuned to the same set of notes, but the tuning will vary from one gamelan to the next, including variations in the size of intervals.

[[Colin McPhee]] , a Canadian composer who spent much time in Bali, remarked, "Deviations in what is considered the same scale are so large that one might with reason state that there are as many scales as there are gamelans."&lt;ref&gt;Colin McPhee, ''Music in Bali''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is contested, however, by some teachers of gamelan, and there have been efforts to combine multiple ensembles and tuning structures into one gamelan to ease transportation at festival time. One such ensemble is gamelan ''Manikasanti'', which can play the repertoire of many different ensembles.

Balinese gamelan instruments are built in pairs that are tuned slightly apart to produce interference [[beat (acoustics)|beats]], ideally at a consistent speed for all pairs of notes in all registers. This concept is referred to as "ombak," translating to "wave," communicating the idea of cyclical undulation. One instrument, tuned slightly higher, is thought of as the "inhale," and the other, slightly lower, is called the "exhale." [Also called the "blower" and the "sucker," or ''pengimbang'' and ''pengisep'' in Bali.] When the inhale and the exhale are combined, beating is produced, meant to represent the beating of the heart, or the symbol of being alive. It is thought that this contributes to the "shimmering" sound of Balinese gamelan ensembles. In the religious ceremonies that contain gamelan, these interference beats are meant to give the listener a feeling of a god's presence or a stepping stone to a meditative state. The scale roughly approximates that of the [[phrygian mode]] of the Western major scale (E-E on the white keys of the piano), with the notes EFGBC corresponding to the note positions 12356 in the ''slendro'' scale used by most gamelan.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cnx.org/content/m15795/latest/ Listening to Balinese Gamelan: A Beginners' Guide]" from ''Connexions.com'' retrieved 20/01/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the non-western octave and the use of beats, [[Java]]nese gamelan uses a combination of tempo and density known as ''[[Irama]]'', relating how many beats on the ''[[saron panerus]]'' instrument there are to notes in the core melody or ''[[balungan]]''; density is considered primary.&lt;ref&gt;Sumarsan. ''Gamelan: cultural interaction and musical development in central Java''. University of Chicago Press, 2nd Edition, 1996. page 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
{{further|Musical notation#Indonesia}}

Gamelan music is traditionally not notated and began as an [[oral tradition]]. In the 19th century, however, the kraton (palaces) of [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] developed distinct notations for transcribing the repertoire. These were not used to read the music, which was memorized, but to preserve pieces in the court records. The Yogyanese notation is a checkerboard notation, which uses six or seven vertical lines to represent notes of higher pitch in the [[balungan]] (melodic framework), and horizontal lines which represent the series of beats, read downward with time. The fourth vertical line and every fourth horizontal line (completing a ''[[gatra (music)|gatra]]'') are darkened for legibility. Symbols on the left indicate the [[colotomy|colotomic or metric structure]] of gongs and so forth, while specific drum features are notated in symbols to the right. The Solonese notation reads horizontally, like Western notation, but does not use barlines. Instead, note values and rests are squiggled between the notes.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Jennifer. ''Javanese Gamelan''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979. Pp. 27–28. {{ISBN|0-19-580413-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today this notation is relatively rare, and has been replaced by [[kepatihan notation]], which is a cipher system. Kepatihan notation developed around 1900 at the [[kepatihan]] Palace in Surakarta, which had become a high-school conservatory. The pitches are numbered (see the articles on the scales ''[[slendro]]'' and ''[[pélog]]'' for an explanation of how), and are read across with dots below or above the numbers indicating the register, and lines above notes showing time values; In vocal notation, there are also brackets under groups of notes to indicate melisma. Like the palace notation, however, Kepatihan records mostly the ''balungan'' part and its metric phrases as marked by a variety of gongs. The other parts are created in real time, and depend on the knowledge each musician has of his instrument, and his awareness of what others are playing; this "realization" is sometimes called "garap." Some teachers have also devised certain notations, generally using kepatihan principles, for the ''[[cengkok]]'' (melodic patterns) of the [[elaborating instruments]]. Some ethnomusicologists, trained in European music, may make transcriptions onto a Western staff. This entails particular challenges of tuning and time, sometimes resulting in unusual [[clef]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in Sorrell, Neil. ''A Guide to the Gamelan''. United Kingdom: Faber and Faber, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Western music==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gamelanorkest TMnr 60043216.jpg|thumb|Gamelan orchestra in [[East Java]], late 19th century]]
The gamelan has been appreciated by several western composers of [[European classical music|classical music]], most famously [[Claude Debussy]] who heard a Javanese gamelan in the premiere of [[Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray]]'s ''Rhapsodie Cambodgienne'' at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Exposition of 1889]] ([[World's Fair]]). The work had been written seven years earlier in 1882, but received its premiere only in 1889. The gamelan Debussy heard in it was in the ''slendro'' scale and was played by Central Javanese musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Sorrell. ''A Guide to the Gamelan''. London: Faber and Faber, 2000. Pages 2–7 discuss the incident, about which much remains uncertain. In particular, it is unknown whether they played the [[Cirebon]]ese instruments that the [[Paris Conservatoire]] received in 1887, which would be substantially different from their ordinary set, or if they brought their own set.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his enthusiasm, direct citations of gamelan scales, melodies, rhythms, or ensemble textures have not been located in any of Debussy's own compositions. However, the equal-tempered [[whole tone scale]] appears in his music of this time and afterward,&lt;ref&gt;Neil Sorrell. ''A Guide to the Gamelan''. London: Faber and Faber, 2000. Although the five notes of the ''slendro'' set are closest in pitch to a [[pentatonic scale]], this scale would have been familiar from other folk sources, as it is a common scale worldwide. It is the equally tempered whole-tone scale that is more analogous of the exotic ''slendro'' scale.&lt;/ref&gt; and a Javanese gamelan-like heterophonic texture is emulated on occasion, particularly in "Pagodes", from ''Estampes'' (solo piano, 1903), in which the [[gong ageng|great gong]]'s [[colotomy|cyclic punctuation]] is symbolized by a prominent perfect fifth.

The composer [[Erik Satie]], an influential contemporary of Debussy, also heard the Javanese gamelan play at the Paris Exposition of 1889.  The repetitively hypnotic effects of the gamelan were incorporated into Satie's exotic [[Gnossienne]] set for piano.&lt;ref&gt;Orledge, Robert''Satie the Composer (Music in the Twentieth Century)''Cambridge University Press (October 26, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct homages to gamelan music are to be found in works for western instruments by [[John Cage]], particularly his [[prepared piano]] pieces, [[Colin McPhee]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Bronislaw Kaper]] and [[Benjamin Britten]]. In more recent times, American composers such as [[Henry Brant]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Dennis Murphy (musician)|Dennis Murphy]], [[Loren Nerell]], [[Michael Tenzer]], [[Evan Ziporyn]], [[Daniel James Wolf]] and [[Jody Diamond]] as well as Australian composers such as [[Peter Sculthorpe]], [[Andrew Schultz]] and [[Ross Edwards (composer)|Ross Edwards]] have written several works with parts for gamelan instruments or full gamelan ensembles. [[I Nyoman Windha]] is among contemporary Indonesian composers that have written compositions using western instruments along with Gamelan. Hungarian composer [[György Ligeti]] wrote a piano étude called ''Galamb Borong'' influenced by gamelan. [[Avant-garde]] composer [[Harry Partch]], one of America's most idiosyncratic composers, was also influenced by Gamelan, both in his [[microtonal]] compositions and the instruments he built for their performance&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.coastonline.org/mml/topic/topicsSearch_detail.php?id=312 Western Artists and Gamelan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307082145/http://www.coastonline.org/mml/topic/topicsSearch_detail.php?id=312 |date=2014-03-07 }}", ''CoastOnline.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In jazz, the music of [[Don Cherry (trumpeter)|Don Cherry]], especially his 1968 record ''Eternal Rhythm'', shows influences of gamelan music.

American folk guitarist [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]] included elements of gamelan in many of his late-1960s sound collages, and again in his 1997 collaboration with [[Cul de Sac (band)|Cul de Sac]], ''The Epiphany of Glenn Jones.''

On the debut EP of [[Sonic Youth]] the track 'She's not Alone' has a gamelan timbre. Experimental pop groups [[The Residents]], [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]] (whose 1984 album was even titled ''Urban Gamelan''), [[Mouse on Mars]], [[His Name Is Alive]], [[Xiu Xiu]], [[Macha (band)|Macha]], Saudade, [[The Raincoats]] and the [[Sun City Girls]] have used gamelan percussion. Avant-garde performance band [[Melted Men]] uses Balinese gamelan instruments as well as gamelan-influenced costumes and dance in their shows. The [[Moodswinger]] built by [[Yuri Landman]] gives gamelan–like clock and bell sounds, because of its [[3rd bridge]] construction. Indonesian-Dutch composer [[Sinta Wullur]] has integrated Western music and gamelan for opera.

==Influence on contemporary music==
In contemporary [[Indonesian music]] scene, some groups fuse contemporary westernized [[jazz fusion]] music with the legacy of traditional [[ethnic music]] traditions. In the case of [[Krakatau (band)|Krakatau]] and [[SambaSunda]], the bands from West Java, the traditional Sundanese [[kacapi suling]] and gamelan degung Sunda orchestra is performed alongside drum set, keyboard and guitars. Other bands such as Bossanova Java fused Javanese music with [[bossa nova]], while the Kulkul band fuse jazz with Balinese gamelan.

The Indonesian singer [[Anggun]] often incorporated in her works Indonesian traditional tunes from the gamelan and tembang style of singing. Typical gamelan tunes can be traced in several songs in her album ''[[Snow on the Sahara]]'' such as "[[Snow on the Sahara (song)|Snow on the Sahara]]", "[[A Rose in the Wind]]", and also in her collaboration works with [[Deep Forest]] on "Deep Blue Sea" on their 2002 album, ''Music Detected''. Philippine-born Indonesian singer [[Maribeth Pascua]] also features gamelan tunes in her songs ''Denpasar Moon'' and ''Borobudur''.

Beyond Indonesia, gamelan has also had an influence on [[J-pop|Japanese popular music]], specifically the [[synthpop]] band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]. Their 1981 record ''[[Technodelic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Monica|title=It's Easy When You're Big In Japan: Yellow Magic Orchestra at The Hollywood Bowl|work=The Vinyl District|url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/losangeles/2011/06/it%E2%80%99s-easy-when-you%E2%80%99re-big-in-japan-yellow-magic-orchestra-at-the-hollywood-bowl/|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first albums to heavily rely on [[Sampling (music)|samples]] and [[Loop (music)|loops]], made use of gamelan elements and samples. Yellow Magic Orchestra member [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] also used gamelan elements for his soundtrack to the 1983 British-Japanese film ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pulvers|first=Roger|title=Ryuichi Sakamoto reminds Japanese what's the score on nuclear blame|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20120701rp.html#.UA4RzrSe78k|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Japan Times]]|date=July 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which won him the 1983 [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0085933|Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (1983)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many listeners were introduced to the sounds of gamelan by the popular 1988 Japanese [[anime]] film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]''. Gamelan elements are used in this film to punctuate several exciting fight scenes, as well as to symbolize the emerging psychic powers of the tragic hero, Tetsuo. The gamelan in the film's score was performed by the members of the [[Japan]]ese musical collective [[Geinoh Yamashirogumi]], using their ''semar pegulingan'' and ''jegog'' ensembles, which were also used in the previous album, ''Ecophony Rinne''. Gamelan and kecak are also used in the soundtrack to the video games ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' and ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]''. The two opening credits of 1998 Japanese [[Anime]] ''[[Neo Ranga]]'' use Balinese music (''Kecak'' and ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar]]''). Each "waking up" of Ranga in the anime uses the ''Gong Kebyar'' theme. The musical soundtrack for the Sci Fi Channel series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' features extensive use of the gamelan, particularly in the 3rd season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/81/ |title=SoundtrackNet 2/28/07 article |publisher=Soundtrack.net |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as do [[Alexandre Desplat]]'s scores for ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring (film)|Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' and ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]''. [[James Newton Howard]], who composed [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney's]] 2001 feature film ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', chose Gamelan for the musical theme of the Atlanteans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Various cast and crew members | title = Atlantis: The Lost Empire—Supplemental Material | medium = DVD | edition = Collector's | series = Disc 2 of 2 | date = January 29, 2002 | publisher = Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment | location = Burbank, CA | id = {{UPC|786936163872}} | ref = DVD2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loops of gamelan music appear in electronic music. An early example is the Texas band [[Drain (band)|Drain]]'s album ''Offspeed and In There'', which contains two tracks where trip-hop beats are matched with gamelan loops from Java and Bali and recent popular examples include the [[Sofa Surfers]]' piece ''Gamelan'', or ''EXEC_PURGER/.#AURICA extracting'', a song sung by [[Haruka Shimotsuki]] as part of the ''[[Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia]]'' soundtracks.

Gamelan influences can also be heard  in the 2004 award-winning pop song, ''Pulangkan'', a theme from the gamelan-cultural related film ''[[Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam]]'' by Malaysian songbird [[Misha Omar]] and also the 2006 hip hop song, Tokyo Drift (Fast &amp; Furious), by [[Teriyaki Boyz]].

In the ''[[Regular Show]]'' episode "150-Piece Kit", a gamelan is mentioned to be part of the eponymous kit.

==Gamelan outside Indonesia==

{{Main|Gamelan outside Indonesia}}

Gamelan is also found outside Indonesia. There are forms of gamelan that have developed outside Indonesia, such as [[American gamelan]] in the United States and [[Malay Gamelan]] in Malaysia. Gamelan has also become quite widespread along the South East of Sri Lanka, particularly with the Tamil community, and in Colombo, at the Indonesian Embassy.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

{{RunicChars}}
The '''Golden Horns of Gallehus''' were two horns made of [[Sheet metal|sheet]] [[gold]],  discovered in Gallehus, north of [[Møgeltønder]] in [[Southern Jutland]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=drfactbox&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2007/12/20/114905.htm?rss=true Official Danish news (DR) page with fact box regarding the subject] {{da icon}}; The horns are also identified as ''Tunderense''  in older literature,   a learned Latin adjective formation of  ''Tundern'', the old name of Tønder.&lt;/ref&gt;
The horns dated to the early 5th century, i.e. the beginning of the [[Germanic Iron Age]].

The horns were found in 1639 and in 1734, respectively, at locations only some 15–20 metres apart.&lt;ref name=drfactbox/&gt; They were composed of segments of double sheet gold. The two horns were found incomplete; the longer one found in 1639 had seven segments with ornaments, to which six plain segments and a plain rim were added, possibly by the 17th-century restorer. The shorter horn found in 1734 had six segments, a narrow one bearing a [[Proto-Norse]] [[Elder Futhark]] inscription at the rim and five ornamented with images. It is uncertain whether the horns were intended as [[drinking horn]]s, or as [[blowing horn]]s, although drinking horns have more pronounced history as luxury items made from precious metal.

The original horns were stolen and melted down in 1802. Casts made of the horns in the late 18th century were also lost. Replicas of the horns must thus rely on 17th and 18th-century drawings exclusively and are accordingly fraught with uncertainty. Nevertheless,  replicas of the original horns were produced and are exhibited at the [[National Museum of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen]], and the [[Moesgaard Museum]], near [[Aarhus]], Denmark. These replicas also have a history of having been stolen and retrieved twice, in 1993 and in 2007.

The horns are the subject of one of the best-known poems in Danish literature, "The Golden Horns" (''Guldhornene''), by [[Adam Oehlenschläger]].

==Description==
Both horns consisted of two layers of gold sheet, the inner sheet of lesser quality, amalgamated with silver, the outer sheet of pure gold. The outer sheet was constructed from a number of rings, each covered with cast figures soldered onto the rings, with yet more figures chased into the rings between the larger figures. The second horn bore an [[Elder Futhark]] inscription in [[Proto-Norse]] which is of great value for [[Germanic linguistics]].

Both horns were once the same length,{{Dubious|date=May 2009}} but a segment of the narrow end of the second (shorter) horn, which was missing when it was found (1734), had already been plowed up and recovered prior to 1639. It also was subsequently melted down and lost.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
The longer horn in its restored state was 75.8&amp;nbsp;cm in length, as measured along the outer perimeter; the opening diameter was 10.4&amp;nbsp;cm., and the horn weighed 3.2&amp;nbsp;kg.

Because the casts made of the horns were lost, it is uncertain whether the horns were simply curved or whether they had a winding, helix-like curvature like a natural ox-horn.

[[Image:Inscription on Golden horn of Gallehus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Detail of the runic inscriptions found on one of the copies housed at the [[Moesgaard Museum]].]]

===Runic inscription===
The second horn bore the following [[Elder Futhark]] inscription ([[Rundata|DR 12 †U]]):
:[[File:Gallehus inscription.png|300px]] (1734 drawing after the original)
:{{Runic|ᛖᚲᚺᛚᛖᚹᚨᚷᚨᛊᛏᛁᛉ᛬ᚺᛟᛚᛏᛁᛃᚨᛉ᛬ᚺᛟᚱᚾᚨ᛬ᛏᚨᚹᛁᛞᛟ᛬}} (Runic [[Unicode]])
:'''ekhlewagastiz:holtijaz:horna:tawido:''' (transliteration)

This is read as a sentence in [[Proto-Norse]], ''{{lang|gem-Latn|ek Hlewagastiz Holtijaz horna tawidō}}'', translating to "I Hlewagastiz Holtijaz made the horn". This inscription is among the earliest inscriptions in the Elder Futhark that record a full sentence, and the earliest preserving a line of [[alliterative verse]].

The meaning of the [[Germanic name|given name]] ''Hlewagastiz'' is debated: it  may mean either "lee guest" or "fame guest". ''Holtijaz'' may either be a patronymic, "son (or descendant) of Holt", or express a characteristic such as "of the wood".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runenprojekt.uni-kiel.de/abfragen/standard/deutung2.asp?findno=28&amp;ort=Gallehus&amp;objekt=Goldhorn Kiel University] has a compilation of literature. Interpretation as a patronymic is more common. The alternative interpretation   "of the sacred grove" is found in Klingenberg, Heinz ,''Runenschrift - Schriftdenken - Runeninschriften''. Heidelberg (1973) and in Grønvik, Ottar,  'Runeinnskriften på gullhornet fra Gallehus' in ''Maal og Minne'' (1999), 1-18. The translation "wood-dweller" is found in Karker, Allan, ''Dansk i tusind år: Et omrids af sprogets historie'', Copenhagen (1993). An interpretation of ''Holt'' as a toponym, translating "from Holt", is found in Gutenbrunner, Siegfried, ''Schleswig-Holsteins älteste Literatur. Von der Kimbernzeit bis zur Gudrundichtung'', Kiel (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible cipher runes===
[[File:Gallehus cipher Hartner.png|thumb|240px|reading of the supposed cipher in the top segment according to Hartner (1969).]]
The two rows of images in the top segment of the longer horn have been taken as a [[Cipher runes|cipher]] encoding a runic text of 22 letters, although there is no universally accepted decipherment.  Hartner (1969)  read  ''luba horns ens helpa hjoho'', an "[[apotropaic]] sentence" translated by Hartner as "may I, the potion of this horn, bring help to the clan".&lt;ref&gt;review of Hartner (1969) by A. T. Reiche in Isis, The History of Science Society (1973), p. 236; c.f. Beer (1970), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
{{further|Migration period art}}
{{double image|left|Large Gallehus horn images.png|190|Small Gallehus horn images.png|170|The image panels of the both horns projected onto a flat surface (etchings by J. R. Paulli, 1734)}}
The figures embossed on the horns combine depictions of numerous anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]] motifs. In addition to the main figures which are soldered to the horn, protruding from the horn surface, there are a number of additional figures and ornaments realized by [[chasing]].

There are numerous attempts at their interpretation, all of them speculative. Interpretation is especially difficult since it has to rely on the imprecise drawings made before the loss of the original horns. Interpretations usually try to align the iconography with [[Germanic mythology]], although Mediterranean ([[Byzantine]]) elements are also cited.

Obvious parallels with Germanic [[Migration Period art]] are rather limited. There are large considerable number of serpents, some of them intertwining in the fashion of the wider [[animal style]] of Dark Age Europe. A figure holding a horn may be compared to the "valkyrie" shown on the [[Tjängvide image stone]]. Two masked figures armed with sword and shield on the smaller horn are reminiscent of other Germanic depictions of [[sword-dance]]s, e.g. on the [[Sutton Hoo helmet]]. Two other armed figures with large horns or antlers may be compared to [[horned helmet]] iconography, or to the "[[Cernunnos]]" figure on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]]. The peculiar image of a tricephalous figure has been taken as a pagan predecessor of depictions of a [[tricephalous Christ]] symbolizing the [[Trinity]] in Christian iconography but is difficult to place in a contemporary context. Olrik (1918) nevertheless recognized a number of [[Norse gods]] among the figures, including [[Tyr]], [[Odin]], [[Thor]] and [[Freyr]].&lt;ref&gt;Axel Olrik, ''Gudefremstillinger paa guldhornene og andre ældre mindesmærker'', Danske Studier (1918), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankfurt historian of science [[Willy Hartner]] in 1969 published an interpretation involving [[gematria]] and [[archaeoastronomy]], taking many of the figures as representing [[constellation]]s, claiming that the iconography refers to a lunar eclipse of 4 November 412 and a solar eclipse of 16 April 413.

The first horn (A) had figures arranged in seven segments, The second horn (B) had six segments including the narrow one containing the runic inscription around the rim.

==Discovery==

[[File:Guldhorn paulli.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Depiction of the horn found AD 1734 on 21 April near the village of Gallehus, in Schackenborg county, not far from the town of Tønder as a peasant was digging, at nearly the same place as a similar one was found AD 1639. It is made from a double gold sheet, the outer one of very fine, the inner of inferior gold. It holds one Maß or ... and weighs 7 pounds 14 ounces]]

===First horn===
The longer horn was discovered on July 20, 1639 by a peasant girl named Kirsten Svendsdatter in the village of Gallehus, near [[Møgeltønder]], Denmark when she saw it protrude above the ground. She wrote a letter to King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] who retrieved it and in turn gave it to the Danish [[Christian V of Denmark|prince Christian]], who{{Dubious|date=May 2009}}&lt;!--Christian V was born only in 1646--&gt; refurbished it into a drinking-horn, adding a golden pommel to be screwed on at the narrow end to close it up.

The Danish antiquarian [[Olaus Wormius]] wrote a treatise named ''De aureo cornu'' on the first Golden Horn in 1641.
The first preserved sketch of the horn comes from this treatise. Wormius notes that he had not seen the horn in the state in which it was found, and it cannot now be determined whether the rim and the narrow segments devoid of ornamentation were modern additions like the pommel.

In 1678, the horn was described in the ''[[Journal des Savants]]''.

===Second horn===
About 100 years later on April 21, 1734 the other (shorter, damaged) horn was found by Erich Lassen not far from the first horn. He gave it to the count of Schackenborg who in turn delivered it to King [[Christian VI of Denmark]] and received 200 [[Danish rigsdaler|rigsdaler]] in return. From this moment both horns were stored at ''Det kongelige Kunstkammer'' (The Royal Chamber of Art) at [[Christiansborg]], currently the Danish [[Rigsarkivet]] (national archive). The shorter horn was described in a treatise by archivist Richard Joachim Paulli in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Published in German as ''Zuverlässiger Abriss des Anno 1734 bey Tundern gefundenen Güldenen Horns'' (1734), in Danish translation as ''Tilforladelig Tegning paa det Anno 1734 udi Jydland fundene Guld-Horn'' (1735), with 7 woodcuts, comprising half-page cut on title page and 6 figures depicting the runic inscription and decorations on the golden horn. For reproductions, cf. Oxenstierna, E. C. G. ''Die Goldhörner von Gallehus'', Lidingö, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burglary and destruction==

===Original horns===
On May 4, 1802, the horns were stolen by a [[goldsmith]] and [[watchmaker]] named Niels Heidenreich from [[Foulum]], who entered a storage area containing the horns using forged keys. Heidenreich took the horns home and melted them down to recycle the gold. The theft was discovered the next day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/golden-horns-of-gallehus/|title=Golden Horns of Gallehus «  Trafficking Culture|website=traffickingculture.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a bounty of 1,000 rigsdaler was advertised in the papers.

The [[master craftsman|grandmaster]] of the goldsmiths [[guild]], Andreas Holm, suspected that Heidenreich had been involved, since he had tried to sell Holm forged “[[pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]s” (Indian coins with god motifs), made from bad gold mixed with [[brass]]. Holm and his colleagues had kept watch on Heidenreich and saw him dump coin stamps in the town moat. He was arrested on April 27, 1803, and confessed on April 30. On June 10, Heidenreich was sentenced to prison, and not released until 1840. He died four years later. His buyers returned the recycled gold, which ended up in coins, not copies of the horns.

However, a set of [[plaster]] casts of the horns had been made for a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in [[Rome]], but they had already been lost in a shipwreck off the [[Corsica]]n coast. Approximate copies were instead created from sketches. The horns pictured above are newer copies, made in 1980.

===Copies===
In 1993, copies of the horns were stolen from [[Moesgaard Museum]], which were shortly after recovered ditched in a forest near [[Hasselager]]. These copies are made of gilded [[brass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1092023.ece Moesgaard udstiller guldhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125611/http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1092023.ece |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2007, a set of modern [[Gilding|gilded]] [[silver]] copies were stolen from Kongernes Jelling museum at 4:30 in the morning,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1091371.ece Professionelle bag tyveri af guldhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000510/http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1091371.ece |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but were recovered shortly after on September 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Trafficking Culture, http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/golden-horns-of-gallehus/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3908">In [[zoology]], a '''graminivore''' (not to be confused with a [[granivore]]) is an [[herbivorous]] animal that feeds primarily on grass&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/graminivorous Graminivorous - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (specifically "true" grasses, plants of the family [[Poaceae]]). The word is derived from Latin ''graminis'', meaning "grass", and ''vorare'', meaning "to eat."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/graminivorous Graminivorous | Define Graminivorous at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Graminivory is a form of [[grazing]].  These herbivorous animals have digestive systems that are adapted to digest large amounts of [[cellulose]], which is abundant in fibrous plant matter and more difficult to break down for many other animals.  As such, they have specialized [[enzyme]]s to aid in digestion and in some cases [[symbiotic bacteria]] that live in their digestive track and "assist" with the digestive process through fermentation as the matter travels through the intestines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/896421272|title=Biology.|last=Connie,|first=Rye,|others=Avissar, Yael,, Choi, Jung Ho, 1956-, DeSaix, Jean,, Jurukovski, Vladimir,, Wise, Robert R.,|isbn=9781938168093|location=Houston, Texas|oclc=896421272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horse]]s, [[cattle]], [[capybara]], [[hippopotamus]]es, [[goose|geese]], and [[giant panda]]s are examples of [[vertebrate]] graminivores. Some carnivorous vertebrates, such as [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s, are known to eat grass occasionally. Grass consumption in dogs can be a way to rid their intestinal tract of parasites that may be threatening to the carnivore's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201412/why-dogs-eat-grass-myth-debunked|title=Why Dogs Eat Grass—a Myth Debunked|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[invertebrate]]s also have graminivorous diets. Many [[grasshopper]]s, such as individuals from the [[Acrididae]] family, have diets consisting primarily of plants from the Poaceae family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Picaud|first=F.|last2=Bonnet|first2=E.|last3=Gloaguen|first3=V.|last4=Petit|first4=D.|title=Decision Making for Food Choice by Grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae): Comparison Between a Specialist Species on a Shrubby Legume and Three Graminivorous Species|url=https://doi-org.libproxy.uregina.ca:8443/10.1603/0046-225X-32.3.680|journal=Environmental Entomology|volume=32|issue=3|pages=680–688|doi=10.1603/0046-225x-32.3.680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graminivores generally exhibit a preference on which species of grass they choose to consume. For example, according to a study done on North American [[bison]] (''Bison bison L.)'' feeding on shortgrass plains in north-eastern [[Colorado]], the cattle consumed a total of thirty-six different species of plant. Of that thirty-six, five grass species were favoured and consumed the most pervasively. The average consumption of these five species comprised about 80% of their diet. A few of these species include ''Aristida longiseta Steud.,'' ''Muhlenbergia sp''., and ''Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peden|first=D. G.|last2=Van Dyne|first2=G.

The '''GreenScreen List Translator''' is a procedure for assessing [[chemical hazard]] used to identify chemicals of concern to prioritize for removal from product formulations. The List Translator assesses substances based on their presence on lists of chemicals associated with human and environmental health hazards issued by a global set of governmental and professional scientific bodies, such as the European Union’s [[GHS hazard statements]] and California's [[Proposition 65]]. 
 
== Analysis procedure ==
The List Translator procedure is defined in the [[GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals]], a transparent, [[open standard]] for [[chemical hazard]] assessment that supports [[alternatives assessment]] for [[toxics use reduction]] through identifying chemicals of concern and safer alternatives.  The GreenScreen protocol is published in a Guidance document that is reviewed and updated regularly. This description of the List Translator is based upon the Hazard Assessment Guidance Version 1.4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals Hazard Assessment Guidance for Chemicals, Polymers and Products |date=January 2018 |publisher=Clean Production Action |edition=Version 1.4 |url=https://www.greenscreenchemicals.org/learn/method-documents |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The List Translator identifies the hazard endpoints for which a substance has been listed on each of a defined set of published hazard lists and the level of hazard. It prioritizes for avoidance those substances listed with a high hazard of any of the following endpoints:
* [[Carcinogenicity]]
* [[Mutagenicity]]
* [[Reproductive toxicity]]
* [[Developmental toxicity]] 
* [[Endocrine disruptor]] or 
* [[Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances]] (PBT). 
This parallels the prioritization schemes underlying various international governmental regulatory programs such as the [[Substance of very high concern]] definition within the [[REACH Regulation]] of the [[European Union]].
 
The central tools of the List Translator are the GreenScreen Specified Lists and the GreenScreen List Translator Map. 
 
* '''GreenScreen Specified Lists''': The List Translator identifies a set of lists as the references for the procedure. These are lists that identify specific chemicals or groups of chemicals that are associated with specific human and environmental health endpoints. The lists are published by a global set of state, national and international governmental bodies, such as the [[California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[European Chemicals Agency]]. The Specified Lists also include lists published by scientific professional associations. In all cases there must be a defined set of threshold criteria and a review process by scientific authorities for listing 
* '''GreenScreen List Translator Map''': The Map characterizes each of the categories within each Specified List 
** The hazard endpoint(s) addressed by the list are identified and a hazard level or range is assigned.  For example, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] Monographs On the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans category of “Group 1 - Agent is Carcinogenic to humans” receives a “High” for Carcinogenicity. The List Translator characterizes the hazard level of substances from very low to very high across twenty human and environmental health endpoints addressing: 
*** [[Human health]] - such as cancer and reproductive toxicity
*** [[Environmental protection]] - primarily [[aquatic toxicity]] 
*** [[Physical hazard]] - [[flammability]] and [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]
*** Environmental fate - [[Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances#Persistence|persistence]] and [[bioaccumulation]]. 
** Lists are also characterized as 
*** Authoritative - high confidence  
*** Screening - lower confidence due to less comprehensive review, use of estimated data or other factors. 
** Authoritative lists and screening lists are both further characterized as:
*** A lists: contain single endpoint with one hazard classification or only one possible List Translator Score. 
*** B lists: contain multiple endpoints and/or hazard classifications
** A chemical receives an overall hazard level for each endpoint based on the highest hazard assigned by the most authoritative lists. 
 
== List Translator scores ==
Scoring a substance is a three part procedure: 
* '''Search the Specified Lists''': Each of the Specified Lists is searched to determine if the substance being scored is listed on any of the lists. It may be identified specifically by CASRN or it may be a member of a listed compound group - a group of substances with a similar chemical structure. 
* '''Compare the endpoints and hazard levels''': The Map is consulted for each list on which the substance is identified to determine a hazard level for each endpoint. If there is more than one listing, the highest hazard level from the most authoritative list is used. 
* '''Calculate List Translator score''': The assigned hazard levels and endpoints are compared to the criteria for GreenScreen’s highest concern category of [[GreenScreen_for_Safer_Chemicals#Benchmark scores|Benchmark 1]]:
**'''LT-1''' (List Translator Likely Benchmark 1) - The substance is on at least one Authoritative A list that meets Benchmark 1 criteria. That is, it meets the criteria for a high hazard carcinogen, mutagen, reproductive toxicant or developmental toxicant or endocrine disruptor or as a persistent bioaccumulative and toxic substance (PBT). The PBT criteria can be met by a combination of lists.
**'''LT-P1''' (List Translator Possible Benchmark 1) - On a list that overlaps Benchmark 1 criteria and/or is a lower confidence Authoritative B or Screening list.
**'''LT-UNK''' (List Translator Benchmark Unknown) - Listed only on a list that does not meet or overlap Benchmark 1 criteria.
**'''NoGSLT'''  (No GreenScreen List Translator information) - Not listed on any of the GreenScreen Specified lists
**'''NoGS''' (No GreenScreen information) - Not on any of the GreenScreen Specified lists and there is no public Greenscreen full assessment.
 
An LT-Unk, No GSLT or NoGS score is not an indication of low hazard or safety for a substance, only that the substance has not been listed for the priority health endpoints. A full GreenScreen Assessment must be undertaken to determine if the substance qualifies as an affirmatively safer substance. 
 
== Automation ==
Any person can use the GreenScreen List Translator protocol to score a substance. The research required to look up the substance in each of the hazard lists is, however,  substantial. Several Licensed GreenScreen List Translator™ Automators aggregate the lists and provide free online lookup services for determining List Translator scores.

== Applications ==
The GreenScreen List Translator is the first step in a GreenScreen Assessment. It is also used as a stand alone screening protocol by health and sustainability screening and certification programs. It is widely referenced in standards and certifications related to green building products, including the [[Health Product Declaration]] Standard (HPD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HPD Open Standard |url=https://www.hpd-collaborative.org/hpd-open-standard/ |website=HPDC |publisher=Health Product Declaration Collaborative |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Portico&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Help Center: How are products scored? |url=https://portico.healthymaterials.net/help/46-how-are-products-scored |website=Portico |publisher=Healthy Building Network |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the "Building product disclosure and optimization - material ingredients" credits in the [[US Green Building Council]]'s [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Building product disclosure and optimization - material ingredients |url=https://www.usgbc.org/credits/new-construction/v4/material-%26-resources |website=EED BD+C: New Construction v4 - LEED v4 - Materials &amp; Resources |publisher=US Green Building Council |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities''' ('''IATH''')  is a research unit of the [[University of Virginia]], USA. Its goal is to explore and develop [[information technology]] as a tool for scholarly [[humanities]] research. To that end, IATH provide Fellows with consulting, technical support, applications development, and networked publishing facilities. It cultivates partnerships and participate in humanities computing initiatives with libraries, publishers, information technology companies, scholarly organizations, and other groups residing at the intersection of computers and cultural heritage.

The research projects, essays, and documentation are the products of a collaboration between humanities and computer science research faculty, computer professionals, student assistants and project managers, and library faculty and staff. In many cases, this work is supported by private or federal funding agencies. In all cases, it is supported by the Fellows’ home departments; the College or School to which those departments belong; the University of Virginia Library; the Vice President for Research and Public Service; the Vice President and Chief Information Officer; the Provost; and the President of the University of Virginia.

==History==
The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities was established at the University of Virginia in 1992, with a major grant from IBM and a multi-year commitment of support from the University.

IATH’s founders are in humanities computing, digital scholarship, and academic administration. Beginning in 1992 a steering committee of scholars, including [[Edward Ayers]], [[Alan Batson]], [[Jerome McGann]], [[Kendon Stubbs]] and [[William Wulf]] managed IATH. A search committee commissioned by the steering committee carried out the search for a director of the institute. [[John Unsworth]] was selected, and his term began September 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.virginia.edu/content/new-leader-ever-expanding-university-library-looks-future |title=With New Leader, Ever-Expanding University Library Looks to the Future |work=UVA Today |publisher=[[University of Virginia]] |first=Katie |last=McNally |date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IATH has generated over $10.7 million in grant funding and gifts in kind since it began operations.  Much of this funding has come from Federal agencies and private foundations, and has gone to support faculty research and teaching across the University.

{{Rhetoric}}
'''''Inventio''''', one of the five canons of rhetoric, is the method used for the ''discovery of arguments'' in Western [[rhetoric]] and comes from the [[Latin]] word, meaning "invention" or "discovery". ''Inventio'' is the central, indispensable canon of rhetoric, and traditionally means a systematic search for [[argument]]s.&lt;ref name=Glenn2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheryl Glenn and Melissa A. Goldthwaite|title=The St. Martin’s Guide to Teaching Writing|year=2008|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|151–156}}

A speaker uses ''Inventio'' when he or she begins the thought process to form and develop an effective argument. Often, the invention phase can be seen as the first step in an attempt to generate ideas or create an argument that is convincing and compelling. The other four canons of [[classical rhetoric]] (the others being [[dispositio]], [[elocutio]], [[memoria]], and [[pronuntiatio]]) rely on their interrelationship with invention.

==Purpose==
{{One source|section|date=December 2013}}
According to Crowley and Hawhee, invention is the division of rhetoric that investigates the possible means by which proofs can be discovered. It supplies the speaker and writers with sets of instructions or ideas that help them to find and compose arguments that are appropriate for a given rhetorical situation.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley and Hawhee, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

For personal and lyric essays, narratives, and descriptive writing, invention techniques help writers draw from their memory and observation for the kinds of details that will add depth to their essays.&lt;ref name=Glenn2008 /&gt;{{rp|151–156}}

The first direction of invention aims toward deriving heuristic procedures or systematic strategies that will aid students in discovering and generating ideas about which they might write; the second direction of invention is characterized by how writers establish "voice" in writing and realize individual selves in discourse.&lt;ref name=Glenn2008/&gt;{{rp|153}}

One of the oldest criticisms of rhetoric is that as an art it has no proper subject matter. In other words, an orator might speak on any topic, with his success being measured purely on the brilliance of his rhetorical skills. This aspect of rhetoric is one reason why [[Plato]] attacked what he saw as empty rhetoric on the part of [[sophist]] philosophers such as [[Gorgias]].

[[Aristotle]], in his works on rhetoric, answered Plato's charges by arguing that reason and rhetoric are intertwined ("Rhetoric is the counterpart of [[Dialectic]]" is the first sentence of his ''Rhetoric''). In Aristotle's view, dialectic reasoning is the mechanism for discovering universal truths; rhetoric is the method for clarifying and communicating these principles to others. And in order to communicate effectively, an orator must be able to assemble proper arguments that support a thesis.

''Inventio'', therefore, is the systematic discovery of rhetorical practices. In the Greek and Roman traditions, rhetorical practices are often but not always arguments. Aristotle, as well as later writers on rhetoric, such as [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]], devoted considerable attention to developing and formalizing the discipline of rhetorical invention. Two important concepts within invention were topoi and stasis. Other rhetorical cultures seem to have additional means of locating "available means." Historian of [[Celts|Celtic]] poetics [[Robert Graves]] credited [[analepsis]] as a method of inventing his historical arguments in ''[[The White Goddess]]'', and the [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]] [[medicine woman]] [[Maria Sabina]] credited the hallucinogenic [[psilocybe]] mushroom with the flow of her discourse. The philosopher Jacques Derrida described ''inventio'' as the "invention of the other."

Janice Lauer proposes that invention should be: (1) applicable to a wide variety of writing situations so that they will transcend a particular topic and can be internalized by the student; (2) flexible in direction allowing a thinker to return to a previous step or skip to an inviting one as the evolving idea suggests; and (3) highly generative by involving the writer in various operations—such as visualizing, classifying, defining, rearranging, and dividing—that are known to stimulate insights.&lt;ref name=Glenn2008/&gt;{{rp|155}}

In classical rhetoric, arguments are obtained from various sources of information, or topoi ([[Greek language|Greek]] 'places'; i.e. "places to find something"), also called by the [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''loci'' (''cf''. [[Literary topoi]]). Topoi are categories that help delineate the relationships among ideas; Aristotle divided these into "common" and "special" groups.

In the common group could be found such categories as laws, witnesses, contracts, oaths, comparisons of similarity, difference, or degree, definitions of things, division of things (whole or parts, for instance), cause and effect, and other items that could be analyzed, researched, or documented.

Modern writers and students use these topics, as well, when discovering arguments, although today more emphasis is placed on scientific facts, statistics, and other "hard" evidence. Classical rhetoricians saw many areas of inquiry that today's writer might view as being purely in the province of "logic," developing syllogisms, finding contradictions, as being of equal or greater importance.  Barbara Warnick has compared the 28 topics of Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' and topical schemes of Chaïm Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca's ''The New Rhetoric'' to illustrate major differences of rhetoric throughout these time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rereading Aristotle's Rhetoric|year=2000|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale|pages=107|author=Barbara Warnick|editor=A.G. Gross &amp; A.E. Walzer|chapter=Two Systems of Invention: The Topics in the Rhetoric and The New Rhetoric}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, two of Aristotle's topics "Opponent's Utterance" and "Response to Slander" were more relevant to ancient debates in the practice of Athenian law, in which every citizen was his or her own lawyer.  On the other hand, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tytecha's schemes were meant to be comprehensive rather than outlining every single detail of speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rereading Aristotle's Rhetoric|year=2000|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale|page=113|author=Barbara Warnick|editor=A. G. Gross &amp; A. E. Walzer|chapter=Two Systems of Invention: The Topics in the Rhetoric and The New Rhetoric}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Aristotle's Rhetoric focused mainly on oral endeavors, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tytecha'sThe New Rhetoric dealt with written arguments.  Writing is a modern innovation that was looked down upon in ancient Greece.  According to Warnick, another difference between the two systems is that Aristotle developed Rhetoric as a way of spreading the practice of rhetoric so it could be performed and taught correctly.  Perelman and Olbrechts-Tytecha's The New Rhetoric emphasized the study of rhetoric, focusing more on the understanding of the topic rather than the practice of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rereading Aristotle's Rhetoric|year=2000|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale|page=112|author=Barbara Warnick|editor=A.G. Gross &amp; A. E. Walzer|chapter=Two Systems of Invention: The Topics in the Rhetoric and The New Rhetoric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special topoi included such concepts as justice or injustice, virtue, good, and worthiness. Again, these are areas of inquiry seen by many today as belonging to other arts, but from Greek times through the Renaissance, these were considered integral to the study and practice of rhetoric.

Topics (or topoi) can be used to invent arguments and also to conceptualize and formulate the single-sentence declarative thesis. Edward P.J. Corbett, Robert Connors, Richard P. Hughes, and P. Albert Duhamel define topics as "ways of probing one's subject in order to find the means to develop that subject".&lt;ref name=Glenn2008/&gt;{{rp|153}} They issued four common topics that are most useful to students: definition, analogy, consequence, and testimony. Definition involves the creation of a thesis by taking a fact or an idea and explaining it by precisely identifying its nature; it always asks the question "What is/was it?" Analogy is concerned with discovering resemblances or differences between two or more things proceeding from known to unknown; it is a useful tool for investigating comparisons and contrasts because it always asks the question "What is it like or unlike?" Consequence investigates phenomena costs to effect-to-cause pattern, best established through probabilities from patterns that have previously occurred. It always answers the question "What caused/causes/will cause it?" Testimony relies on appeals to an authority (such as an expert opinion, statistics, or the law), and it always answers the question "What does an authority say about it?" "Ultimately a thesis or an argument must say something about the real world. Teaching the topics requires using examples and good examples are to be had by applying each topic to a definite subject and coming up with several thesis statements".&lt;ref name=Glenn2008/&gt;{{rp|156}}

==Modes of persuasion==
Aristotle described three "modes of persuasion," or "appeals."&lt;ref name="Aristotle 1924 1356a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=Rhetoric|year=1924|others=Translated by W. Rhys Roberts|publisher=Dover|location=Mineola, NY|page=1356a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first dealt with the matter of the case (logos), the second dealt with the character of the speaker (ethos), and the third dealt with the emotions of the audience (pathos).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ice|first=Richard|title=Rhetoric in Civic Life|year=2012|publisher=Strata Publishing Inc.|location=State College, Pennsylvania|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each mode of persuasion can be inventional, helping an orator create an effective argument.

Aristotle defined ethos as an appeal based on a speaker’s character within a persuasive act. Later, the Roman rhetorician Cicero expanded this definition to contain elements of character outside a particular rhetorical act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ice|first=Richard|title=Rhetoric in Civic Life|year=2012|publisher=Strata Publishing Inc.|location=State College, PA|chapter=1&amp;5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most rhetoric scholars today combine the two definitions, understanding ethos to mean character both inside and outside a rhetorical circumstance. Speakers use the mode of ethos when they create an argument based on their own character. When relying on ethos, a speaker uses personal “trustworthiness or credibility” to persuade the audience to believe their specific argument on a particular topic (Ramage 81). For example, if a presidential candidate has a long history of philanthropy, he or she will invent an argument that demonstrates personal good character in order to convince the audience that he or she is the best candidate for office.

Pathos represents an appeal to the audience’s emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ice|first=Richard|title=Rhetoric in Civic Life|year=2012|publisher=Strata Publishing Inc.|location=State College, PA|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal can be achieved by the use of metaphors, storytelling, or general passion. In order to appeal to an audience’s emotions during the speech’s delivery, the speaker must first take the audience’s emotion into account during the early invention phase. For example, if a presidential candidate grew up poor and managed to succeed in life through hard work and education, then the candidate would have to apply that story to the speech-inventing process in order to appeal to the audience’s emotions. This storytelling draws upon the common "bootstraps" narrative of American culture, one that often appeals to the emotions of the U.S. electorate.

As Aristotle explains, logos, often referred to as the "logical" appeal, uses the arguments present in the case itself to appeal to the audience's reason. Aristotle writes that logos depends on "the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself." &lt;ref name="Aristotle 1924 1356a"/&gt; Logos appeals work "when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question." &lt;ref name="Aristotle 1924 1356a"/&gt;  ''Inventio'' is linked with logos such that it deals with what an author would say as opposed to ''how'' it might be said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton|first=Gideon O.|title=Invention|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/canons/invention.htm|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Stasis''==
According to rhetorical scholar Thomas O. Sloane, Cicero described rhetoric as the devising of true or seemingly true arguments for the sake of making one’s case appear probable.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 462"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloane|first=Thomas|title=National Council of English|year=1989|page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a speaker must debate both sides of an argument to invent an effective argument.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 462"/&gt; Sloane goes on to say it is important for a speaker to critique every aspect of his or her argument. Ciceronian invention is simply an analytical process of argument.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 466"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloane|first=Thomas|title=Reinventing Inventio|year=1989|publisher=National Council of Teachers of English|page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a theorist of law, Cicero put forward a specific procedure commonly referred to as stasis theory.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 466"/&gt;

Stasis is a procedure by which a speaker poses questions in order to clarify the main issues and persuasive points of a speech or debate.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 44–74"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloane|first=Thomas|title=Reinventing Inventio|year=1989|publisher=National Council of Teachers of English|pages=44–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure allows the speaker to critically question each point, assessing the relative worth of each point as appropriate to the substance of the case and to its capacity to persuade an audience.

Using stasis theory gives the speaker numerous advantages that will help them excel in persuading. According to Crowley and Hawhee, the following advantages may accrue in the use of stasis theory.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 44–74"/&gt;

*Allows the speaker to clarify his or her thinking about the point in dispute.
*Allows the speaker to consider the assumption and values an audience holds. 
*Establishes certain areas in which more research and effort needs to be spent.
*Distinguishes which points are crucial to an effective argument.
*Guides the speaker towards building an effective arrangement for their argument or speech.

There are four types of stasis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawhee, Debra and Sharon Crowley|chapter=Stasis theory: Asking the right questions |title=Ancient Rhetorics for Contemporary Students |year=1999|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston|pages=44–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; conjectural (question of fact: Is/was it?), definitional (question of definition: What is/what is its meaning?), qualitative (question of quality: How good or bad is/was it), and translative (question of place or procedure: Is/was this appropriate process or place to handle the matter?). For instance, a lawyer defending someone accused of damaging property might pose the following questions:

*Question of fact: did the person damage the item? (conjectural)
*Question of definition: was the damage minor or major? (definitional)
*Question of quality: was he justified in damaging the item? (qualitative)
*Question of jurisdiction: should this be a civil or criminal trial? (translative)

The question of fact is key as the first step in formulating any argument is separating the true from the false. If the terms of the argument at hand cannot be agreed on, the discussion will not move in any positive direction. Going back and forth attacking sources of information is not conducive to making any real progress, so an emphasis on using only solid information and evidence-based anecdotes is at the crucial to achieving stasis

The question of definition means to define what, exactly, the issue of concern is, and what, if any, biases or preconceptions our arguments hold. Then, categorizing the problem is the next focus, agreeing on the class of the event and therefore the attitude with which it should be approached. A political disagreement should be investigated with a different lens than a criminal case, for example, as they are concerns of a different nature.

The question of quality means identifying the magnitude of the event, the wider impacts, as well as what would happen if no action were to be taken. Identifying if this problem is important as part of a bigger picture is key to preparing a sound argument, as well as figuring out whether or not it is a cause worth pursuing. The quality aspect of stasis comes down to deciding if this particular problem requires attention, and at what cost will a resolution come about.

The question of jurisdiction means formulating a plan of action. Just as we calculate whether the particular problem is worth the energy in the quality category, here we make the decision to take action. A plan of action includes determining what kind of people should be involved in solving this problem, and what strategy these people will use.&lt;ref&gt;https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/736/1/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention in the rhetorical tradition==
Invention also entails the adaptation of ideas and stylistic devices to unfamiliar audiences.&lt;ref name="Murphy 1997 71–89"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=John M.|title=Inventing Authority: Bill Clinton, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Orchestration of Rhetorical Traditions|year=1997|pages=71–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetorical scholar John M. Murphy argues that rhetorical traditions consist of common patterns of language use and organized “social knowledge” of communities that make resources available for the invention of effective arguments.&lt;ref name="Murphy 1997 71–89"/&gt; Invention allows these rhetorical traditions to be adapted across cultural differences or situations. Murphy provides an example in which an orator would blend several rhetorical traditions: one by which the orator might primarily identify and another by which the audience might identify, thus merging speaker and audience through a display of interconnected rhetorical traditions.&lt;ref name="Murphy 1997 71–89"/&gt;

To Cicero, traditional rhetoric was a "mode of thought" and to attain this rhetoric it is required to make the "true nature of rhetorical inventio" apparent.&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sloane|first=Thomas O.|title=Reinventing Inventio|journal=College English|date=Sep 1989|volume=51|issue=5|pages=303–473|doi=10.2307/378000|jstor=378000|publisher=National Council of Teachers of English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas O. Sloane, a rhetorical scholar, discusses that ''inventio'' in the rhetorical tradition specifically refers to addressing the pros and cons of an argumentation.&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;  Sloane argues that it is required when using ''inventio'' as a tool that one must not only consider the discourse at hand but the discourses that accompany the positives and negatives attached.&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;  In further explanation, one must debate all sides of an argument "or one's ''inventio'' will remain not fully invented."&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;  In modern revivals of rhetoric, Sloane argues along with Reed Way Dasenbrock that these pros and cons of ''inventio'' do not have as much emphasis as they did in Cicero.&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;  This lack of attention to different sides of an argument is why Dasenbrock believes that the revival of rhetoric "is relevant; [but] it isn't complete."&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;

==Amplification and invention==
[[Amplification (rhetoric)|Amplification]] is a term in rhetoric defined as the enrichment of words to increase rhetorical effect.  It is closely related to invention such that it deals with the development and progression of notions, drawing from the topics of invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton|first=Gideon O.|title=Figures of Amplification|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Figures/Groupings/of%20amplification.htm|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Topics of invention can also be seen as topics of amplification, especially those of division, definition, and comparison.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3683">A '''jeremiad''' is a long literary work, usually in [[prose]], but sometimes in [[verse (poetry)|verse]], in which the author bitterly laments the state of society and its morals in a serious tone of sustained invective, and always contains a [[prophecy]] of society's imminent downfall.

==Origins and usage==
The word is an [[eponym]], named after the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[prophet]] [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]], and comes from Biblical works attributed to him, the ''[[Book of Jeremiah]]'' and the ''[[Book of Lamentations]]''.  The Book of Jeremiah prophesies the coming downfall of the [[Kingdom of Judah]], and asserts that this is because its rulers have broken the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with [[God|the Lord]].

The ''Lamentations'', similarly, lament the fall of the kingdom of Judah after the conquest prophesied by Jeremiah has occurred:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!&lt;br&gt;She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.&lt;br&gt;  Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.&lt;br&gt;The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.&lt;ref&gt;Lamentations 1:1–4 ([[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Generally, the term ''jeremiad'' is applied to moralistic texts that denounce a society for its wickedness, and prophesy its downfall. The jeremiad was a favorite literary device of the Puritans especially in sermons like "[[Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God]]" by [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Bruce C. Puritans at Play. New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-4039-7212-5}} {{Page needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors from [[Gildas]] to [[Robert Bork]] have had this label hung on their works. Extending that tradition in a reflective vein is the [[A Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass|autobiographical work]] of freed American slave [[Frederick Douglass]], who lamented the moral corruption that slavery wrought on America – from both a [[Jeffersonian political philosophy|Jeffersonian]] and [[Christian]] tradition. In contemporary usage, it is frequently [[pejorative]], meant to suggest that the tone of the text is excessively [[pessimism|pessimistic]] and overwrought.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13893">A '''[[master's degree]] in [[Financial Economics]]''' provides a rigorous understanding of [[theory|theoretical]] [[finance]] and the [[economics|economic]] framework upon which that theory is based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfe.economics.utoronto.ca/about.html | title=U of T : Economics : Master of Financial Economics Program (MFE) | publisher=Mfe.economics.utoronto.ca | date= | accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree is [[postgraduate]], and usually incorporates a [[thesis]] or research component. Programs may be offered jointly by the [[business school]] and the [[economics]] department.

The nature of the degree differs by university. Generally, the degree is largely theoretical, and prepares graduates for [[research]] positions, for [[doctoral]] study in [[economics]], or for roles in [[applied economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.slu.edu/programs-of-study/graduate-business-programs/ms-in-applied-financial-economics/ MS in Applied Financial Economics], John Cook School of Business, Saint Louis University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birkbeck"/&gt; Some are positioned as [[professional degree]]s, preparing graduates for [[career]]s in investment banking and finance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ysu.edu/gen/class/Graduate_Program_m51.html |title=Economics Department, College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, Youngstown State University|publisher=As.ysu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://le.ac.uk/courses/financial-economics-msc Financial Economics MSc], University of Leicester&lt;/ref&gt;
and are comparable to the [[Master of Science in Finance]], though with an increased weighting towards economic theory. In some cases, programs are substantially quantitative&lt;ref name="okstate1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spears.okstate.edu/finance/degrees/msqfe |title=MS in Quantitative Financial Economics |publisher=Spears.okstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are largely akin to a [[Master of Quantitative Finance]].

Closely related degrees include the "Master of Finance and Economics" &lt;ref name="Queen Mary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/msc/financeandeconomics/ |title=MSc (Econ) Finance and Economics &amp;#124; School of Economics and Finance, Queen Mary, University of London |publisher=Econ.qmul.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "[[Master of Economics]] with a specialization in Finance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessandeconomics.mq.edu.au/postgraduate_coursework_programs/2011_programs_of_study/MASTER_OF_ECONOMICS_with_a_specialisation_in_FINANCIAL_ECONOMICS_2011.pdf Master of Economics with a specialisation in Financial Economics], [[Macquarie University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently,{{When|date=November 2014}} undergraduate degrees in the discipline are offered.&lt;ref&gt;e.g.: [http://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/126/financial-economics Kent]; [http://www.city.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/financial-economics City London]; [http://undergradbusiness.ucr.edu/major/financial_economics.html UC Riverside]; [http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/economics/undergraduate Leicester]; [http://www.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/index/undergraduate/load/overview Toronto]; [http://www.umbc.edu/economics/BS_1.html UMBC].&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree is gaining in recognition: [[University of Oxford|Oxford's]] Financial Economics MSc &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/degrees/mfe/Documents/MFE%20Programme%20Specification%20(updated%20September%202010).pdf MSc in Financial Economics], [[Oxford University]].&lt;/ref&gt; is the fourth ranked worldwide amongst ''all'' Masters in Finance programs (Pre-experience).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/masters-in-finance-pre-experience-2012 FT Rankings: Masters in Finance Pre-experience 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Note though that Financial Economics programs are not necessarily comparable with generalist programs in finance.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Masters in Financial Economics are usually one to one and a half years in duration, and typically include a [[thesis]] or research component. The programs require a [[bachelor's degree]] prior to admission, but do not (usually) require an undergraduate [[Academic major|major]] in finance or economics; a typical requirement is exposure to ([[Multivariable Calculus|multivariable]]) [[calculus]], [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], [[linear algebra]], and [[differential equations]]. Many programs include a review of these topics as an [[University and college admission|admission-]] or preliminary course.&lt;ref name="Birkbeck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manchester"&gt;[http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/disciplines/economics/postgraduate/psmaths/ Manchester's "Pre-Session" Mathematics &amp; Statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127195449/http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/disciplines/economics/postgraduate/psmaths/ |date=2012-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IDC"&gt;[https://www.idc.ac.il/en/schools/rris/graduate/Documents/mafe-brochure.pdf MA in Financial Economics, IDC Herzliya]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/index/graduate/courseDetails/4282 Mathematics and Statistics for MA and MFE Students], University of Toronto&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[curriculum]] is distributed between theory, applications, and modelling, with the emphasis on each differing by university and program, as above.

* The theory component centres on [[decision making]] under [[uncertainty]] in the context of the [[financial markets]], and the resultant [[economic model|economic]] and [[financial model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719120650/http://mit.econ.au.dk/vip_htm/akoch/outlineEC5010.pdf Outline for ‘Financial Economics’], [[Royal Holloway]], [[University of London]]&lt;/ref&gt; The degree essentially explores how [[homo economicus|rational investors]] would apply [[decision theory]] to the problem of [[investment]].  Investment under "[[certainty]]" is initially considered ([[Fisher separation theorem]], [[The Theory of Investment Value|"theory of investment value"]], [[Modigliani-Miller theorem]]). [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|"Choice under uncertainty"]] is then introduced, and the twin assumptions of [[rational pricing|rationality]] and [[efficient markets|market efficiency]] lead to [[modern portfolio theory]] and the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]], and to the [[Black Scholes]] theory for [[Valuation of options|option pricing]].  Where the program emphasizes economics, the curriculum is extended:  it explores phenomena where these assumptions do not hold ([[Noise trader|noise trading]], [[market microstructure]], [[Behavioral economics#Behavioral finance|behavioural finance]]) and it discusses models which are further generalised ([[arbitrage pricing theory]], [[Mathematical finance#Derivatives pricing: the Q world|continuous time finance]] / [[Martingale pricing]]) or extended ([[Fama–French three-factor model|Multi-factor models]], [[Short-rate model|models of the short rate]], [[Intertemporal CAPM]], [[Black–Litterman model]]). Coursework here is often titled "[[Asset pricing]]" and "Corporate finance theory". Economics focused programs (often) separately cover [[microeconomics]] and /or [[decision theory]] as foundational topics.

* Application of the economic principles includes [[asset allocation]] and [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]], and covers specific [[financial instrument]]s — such as [[fixed income]], [[equities]], [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] — and their [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolios]]. The aim here is twofold: firstly, to complement the theory; secondly, providing graduates with practical market knowledge. In the economics-focused degrees, this coverage may (will) be of secondary importance, while in the professional degrees it is a major component, and often includes separate [[course work]] in (practical) [[corporate finance]], [[Investment management|portfolio management]] and [[financial risk management]]. [[Macroeconomics]] is also usually included; often though, as opposed to covering macroeconomic theory in general, the topics are applied and / or finance related with a focus on [[Economic forecasting|modelling and forecasting]] the relationships between [[asset class]]es and their [[Expectation (epistemic)|expected]] [[Return (finance)|returns]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [http://www.ucc.ie/modules/descriptions/EC.html#EC6001 Macroeconomics for Financial Markets], [[University College Cork]]; [http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/degrees/mfe/Documents/MFE%20Programme%20Specification%20(updated%20September%202010).pdf MSc in Financial Economics], [[Oxford University]]; [http://business.cf.ac.uk/degree-programmes/economics/msc-financial-economics MSc in Financial Economics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229194557/http://business.cf.ac.uk/degree-programmes/economics/msc-financial-economics |date=2012-02-29 }}, [[Cardiff University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

* The modelling curriculum [[wikt:complement|complements]] both of the above.   The theory is augmented via the study of [[econometrics]], [[time series|financial time series]] and [[statistical model]]ling,  with a focus on the [[empirical]] and statistical [[Economics#Empirical investigation|testing of economic theory]],&lt;ref name="Birkbeck"&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/study/pg/economics/TMSECFIN.html Birkbeck Financial Economics (MSc)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/ecofin/economics/coursesandprogrammes/postgraduate/Masters/Pages/MComFinancialEconomics.aspx|title=MCom (Financial Economics), University of Johannesburg|publisher=uj.ac.za |date= |accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on developing and documenting new econometric models.  Students are taught to model using [[statistical packages]] such as [[SAS (software)|SAS]] and [[EViews]]. The applications are reinforced through the [[Financial modeling#Quantitative finance|computer based implementation of the more complex problems]] (often including [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|numeric methods for option pricing]], [[Value at risk]], [[Portfolio optimization|constructing efficient portfolios]] and [[Yield curve construction|yield curve modeling]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.ac.uk/economics/finance/modules.html |title=City University, London - Modules: MSc Financial Economics |publisher=city.ac.uk|accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, though, the focus is typically on the ''concept'' as opposed to the [[mathematical model|modelling]], ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'', and may therefore be limited to the [[spreadsheet]] environment: [[Computational finance]] is the domain of specialized degrees, although some Financial Economics programs&lt;ref name="okstate1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Queen Mary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/financialeconomics/ |title=Financial Economics MSc - University of Glasgow |publisher=gla.ac.uk |date=2018-01-25 |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; do emphasize mathematical modelling and programming.

==Comparison with other qualifications==
There is some overlap with programs in [[financial engineering]], [[computational finance]] and [[mathematical finance]]; see [[Master of Quantitative Finance]] (MQF). These degrees aim to train practitioners and [[quantitative analyst|"quants"]] — i.e. [[Expert|specialist]]s in [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], [[fixed income]] and [[Risk analysis (business)|risk analysis]] — as opposed to [[economist]]s, and their curricula are therefore weighted toward [[stochastic calculus]], [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]], [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|simulation techniques]] and programming, and are quantitative (well) beyond the level of the Financial Economics degree. Entrance requirements are similarly more mathematical.  On the other hand, coverage of financial and economic theory, and econometrics, while significant, is comparatively secondary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/senate/archives/resolutions_archives/resolutions/09-10/financial_economics_res.html Resolution to Establish a Program Leading to the Master of Science In Financial Economics], [[Columbia University]] Senate&lt;/ref&gt;  As mentioned, some Financial Economics programs are substantially quantitative; these differ little from the MQF.

The overlap with general finance degrees, such as a [[Master of Science in Finance]] (MSF) or an [[Master in Business Administration#Content|M.B.A. in finance]], is further limited, particularly where the Financial Economics program is theory oriented. These degrees are focused on [[Managerial finance|financial management]], [[corporate finance]] and [[investment management]], and are practice oriented with limited exposure to the underlying economic theory. Note though, that since these courses train graduates in the ''use'' of the models developed in Financial Economics, the theory is (sometimes) covered in the context of a (basic) understanding of model assumptions. Similar comments apply to professional certifications such as the [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] (CFA) designation.  Note also that the [[Master of Finance]] (M.Fin.) and [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] Finance, as opposed to the ''MSF'', have a significant theory component (as well as quantitative component),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bcf.princeton.edu/master-in-finance/|title=Master in Finance - Bendheim Center for Finance - Princeton University |publisher=Princeton.edu |date=2018-01-25 |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and largely overlap with the master's in Financial Economics.

For comparison, the [[Kola Superdeep Borehole]] has a slightly shorter measured depth at 12,262 m, but since this is a vertical borehole, this is also equal to the true vertical depth, making the Kola Superdeep Borehole deeper by a factor of 6.9.

'''Multi-link trunking (MLT)''' is a [[link aggregation]] [[port trunking]] technology developed at [[Nortel]] in 1999. It allows grouping several physical [[Ethernet]] links into one logical Ethernet link to provide fault-tolerance and high-speed links between routers, switches, and servers.

Using this technology allows or enables the use of several links (from 2 up to 8) and combined them to create increased bandwidth and several fail-over paths. This produces server to switch or switch to switch connections that are up to 8 times faster. In the past redundant links were unused due to [[Spanning tree protocol|Spanning Tree]]’s loop protection.

[[Fault-tolerant design]] is an important aspect of Multi-Link Trunking technology. Should any one or more than one link fail, the MLT technology will automatically redistribute traffic across the remaining links. This automatic redistribution is accomplished in less than half a second (typically less than 100 millisecond&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tolly.com/ts/2007/Nortel/ERSswitches/Tolly207171NortelERSwitchSMLT.pdf | title=Evaluation of Resilient Routing Switches for Real-Time Multimedia Traffic with Microsoft Live Communications Server 2005 and Nortel MCS 5100 | publisher=The Tolly Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;) so no outage is noticed by end users. This high speed recovery is required by many critical networks where outages can cause loss of life or very large monetary losses in critical networks. Combining MLT technology with [[Distributed Split Multi-Link Trunking]] (DSMLT), [[Split multi-link trunking]] (SMLT), and [[R-SMLT]] technologies create networks that support the most critical applications.

A general limitation of standard MLT is that all the physical ports in the link aggregation group must reside on the same switch. SMLT, DSMLT and R-SMLT technologies removes this limitation by allowing the physical ports to be split between two switches.

Link aggregation or MLT allows multiple physical network links between two network switches and another device (which could be another switch or a network device such as a server) to be treated as a single logical link and load balance the traffic across all available links.  For each packet that needs to be transmitted, one of the physical links is selected based on a [[load balancing (computing)|load-balancing]] [[algorithm]] (usually involving a [[hash function]] operating on the source and destination [[Media Access Control]] (MAC) address information). For real-world network traffic this generally results in an effective bandwidth for the logical link equal to the sum of the bandwidth of the individual physical links. Redundant links that were once unused due to Spanning Tree’s loop protection can now be used to their full potential.

A general limitation of standard link aggregation, MLT or [[EtherChannel]] is that all the physical ports in the link aggregation group must reside on the same switch. The SMLT, [[DSMLT]] and [[RSMLT]] protocols remove this limitation by allowing the physical ports to be split between two switches, allowing for the creation of Active load sharing [[high availability]] network designs that meet [[Nines (engineering)|five nines]] availability requirements.

===SMLT Topologies===
[[Image:SMLT.JPG|300px|thumb|right|SMLT triangle between 3 [[Avaya]] switches 40Gbit/s full duplex to edge switch]]The two switches between which the SMLT is split are known as aggregation switches and form a logical cluster which appears to the other end of the SMLT link as a single switch.

The split may be at one or at both ends of the MLT. If both ends of the link are split, the resulting topology is referred to as an "SMLT square" when there is no cross-connect between diagonally opposite aggregation switches, or an "SMLT mesh" when each aggregation switch has a SMLT connection with both aggregation switches in the other pair. If only one end is split, the topology is referred to as an SMLT triangle.

In an SMLT triangle, the end of the link which is not split does not need to support SMLT. This allows non-Avaya devices including third-party switches and servers to benefit from SMLT. The only requirement is that IEEE 802.3ad static mode must be supported.

=== Operation ===
[[Image:Server-SMLT.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Server SMLT triangle]]The key to the operation of SMLT is the [[Inter-Switch Trunk]] (IST).  The IST is a (standard) MLT connection between the aggregation switches which allows the exchange of information regarding traffic forwarding and the status of individual SMLT links.

For each SMLT connection, the aggregation switches have a standard MLT or individual port with which an SMLT identifier is associated.  For a given SMLT connection, the same SMLT ID must be configured on each of the peer aggregation switches.

For example, when one switch receives a response to an [[Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]] request from an end-station on a port that is part of an SMLT, it will inform its peer switch across the IST and request the peer to update its own ARP table with a record pointing to its own connection with the corresponding SMLT ID.

In general, normal network traffic does not traverse the IST unless this is the only path to reach a host which is connected only to the peer switch.  By ensuring all devices have SMLT connections to the aggregation switches, traffic never needs to traverse the IST and the total forwarding capacity of the switches in the cluster is also aggregated.

The communication between peer switches across the IST allows both unicast and multicast routing information to be exchanged allowing protocols such as [[Open Shortest Path First]] (OSPF) and [[PIM Sparse Mode|Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode]] (PIM-SM) to operate correctly.

===Failure Scenarios===
[[File:Video SMLT Presentation.theora.ogv|700px]]
The use of SMLT not only allows traffic to be load-balanced across all the links in an aggregation group but also allows traffic to be redistributed very quickly in the event of link or switch failure. In general the failure of any one component results in a traffic disruption lasting less than half a second (normal less than 100 millisecond&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;) making SMLT appropriate in environments running time- and loss-sensitive applications such as voice and video.

In a network using SMLT, it is often no longer necessary to run a [[spanning tree protocol]] of any kind since there are no logical bridging loops introduced by the presence of the IST. This eliminates the need for spanning tree reconvergence or root-bridge failovers in failure scenarios which causes interruptions in network traffic longer than time-sensitive applications are able to cater for.

===Product Support===
SMLT is supported within the following Avaya Ethernet Routing Switch (ERS) and Virtual Services Platform (VSP) Product Families: ERS 1600, [[Avaya ERS 5500|ERS 5500]], [[Avaya ERS-5600 Systems|ERS 5600]], [[Avaya VSP-7000 System|ERS 7000]], [[Avaya ERS 8300|ERS 8300]], [[Avaya ERS 8800|ERS 8800]], [[Avaya ERS 8600|ERS 8600]], [[MERS 8600]], [[Avaya VSP-9000 System|VSP 9000]]

SMLT is fully interoperable with devices supporting standard MLT (IEEE 802.3ad static mode).

==R-SMLT==
'''Routed-SMLT''' ('''R-SMLT''') is a computer networking [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] developed at Nortel as an enhancement to [[split multi-link trunking]] (SMLT) enabling the exchange of Layer 3 information between peer nodes in a switch cluster for resiliency and simplicity for both L3 and L2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In many cases, core network convergence time after a failure is dependent on the length of time a routing protocol requires to successfully converge (change or re-route traffic around the fault). Depending on the specific routing protocol, this convergence time can cause network interruptions ranging from seconds to minutes.  The R-SMLT protocol works with SMLT and [[distributed Split Multi-Link Trunking]] (DSMLT) technologies to provide sub-second failover (normally less than 100 milliseconds)&lt;ref&gt;

RSMLT routing topologies providing an active-active router concept to core SMLT networks. The protocol supports networks designed with SMLT or DSMLT triangles, squares, and SMLT or DSMLT full mesh topologies, with routing enabled on the core VLANs.  R-SMLT takes care of packet forwarding in core router failures and works with any of the following protocol types: IP Unicast Static Routes, RIP1, RIP2, OSPF, BGP and IPX RIP.

===Product support===
R-SMLT is supported on Avaya's Ethernet Routing Switch [[ERS 8600]], ERS 8800, VSP9000, ERS 8300 and [[MERS 8600]] products.

Fault-tolerance is a very important aspect of Distributed Split Multi-Link Trunking (DSMLT) technology. Should any one switch, port, or more than one link fail, the DSMLT technology will automatically redistribute traffic across the remaining links. Automatic redistribution is accomplished in less than half a second (typically less than 100 milliseconds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tolly.com/ts/2007/Nortel/ERSswitches/Tolly207171NortelERSwitchSMLT.pdf | title=Evaluation of Resilient Routing Switches for Real-Time Multimedia Traffic with Microsoft Live Communications Server 2005 and Nortel MCS 5100 | publisher=The Tolly Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;) so no outage is noticed by end users.  This high speed recovery is required by many critical networks where outages can cause loss of life or very large monetary losses in critical networks.

Its Tablet XXXII (often called as U.3011) is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]-[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] text from [[Ur]], and notable as one of the oldest extant documented examples of [[musical notation]]. Although on its own the tablet is somewhat cryptic, analysis of other ancient Babylonian texts reveals that it describes the nine [[Strings (music)|strings]] of an unidentified instrument and its [[Interval (music)|intervals]]. The nine strings, numbered symmetrically as 123454321, are presented in two parallel columns, one in Sumerian and the other in Akkadian. Tablet XXXII is now in the collections of the [[British Museum]].

The '''National University of Laos (NUOL)''' is a [[university]] in [[Vientiane]], the capital of [[Laos]]. Founded in 1996, with departments brought in from other existing colleges, it is the only national university in the country. The NUOL accepts students from all over Laos, along with international students.

The university is a partner of the [[Greater Mekong Sub-region Academic and Research Network]] (GMSARN) and [[ASEAN University Network]] (AUN).

==History==
National University of Laos "NUOL" was established by merging the higher education institutes which were under the supervision of several ministries into one university under the Ministry of Education in accordance to the Decree Number 50/PM of the Prime Minister of the [[Lao PDR]] dated 9 June 1995.

NUOL is a multi-campus structure, with five campuses including, Dongdok campus (Cenral), Sokpaluang campus (Faculty of Engineering), Nabong campus (Faculty of Agriculture), Donnokkhum campus (Faculty of Law) and Tadthong campus (Faculty of Water resource). It composes of 13 faculties, 2 institutes (Institute of Lao-Japan Human Resource Development and Institute of Chinese conficious), a Central Library, six centers and a small hospital.

NUOL has played 4 roles in 1/ providing higher education in areas required for the socio-economic development of [[Lao PDR]]; 2/ performing research in natural and social sciences; 3/ preserving the arts, culture and traditions of the nation; and 4/ providing academic services to society. It is known for its diversity programs in [[Bachelor degree]]s; some [[Master degree]] programs are conducted in its academic disciplines, and Doctoral degree programs, as well.

Since the opening of its first academic year on 5 November 1996, the number of students has increased from 8,053 (including 2,170 females) to around 40,000 in 2009-2010 academic year. Then, since the policy of increasing vocational manpower of country, the acceptable number of students come down to around 23,000 student in recent year. At present, NUOL is accepted as one of the main and important public organization in the [[Lao PDR]].

In modernization of the university toward digital-based university in the future, IT Center was established in 2002 and be directly supervised by president of NUOL. The IT Center of NUOL is upgraded its roles to 1/ Develop and Manage the ICT infrastructure in the whole university, 2/ Develop ICT human resource toward "ICT based society", 3/ Supporting and Doing research in the field of Computer Science and ICT, and 4/ to provide academic services. For strengthen the ICT system in line with the University ICT Development Plan, initialize in the academic year 2004-2005, ICT infrastructure had been supported by Sida-SAREC in 2005-2010. The ICT Development plan of university is adjusted or improved almost every year in order to catch up with the change of the technology. However, it is hard in order to take it into action due to the lack of budget for it investment. Many of ICT works are belong to the supports from outside, such as International organization activities. 2011, Since the project called "ASEAN Cyber University" which support by Republic of Korea, the e-Learning has been being done in NUOL.

The United States '''Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory''' ('''NRDL''') was an early military lab created to study the effects of radiation and nuclear weapons. The facility was based at the [[Treasure Island Naval Station Hunters Point Annex|Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard]] in San Francisco, California.

==History==
The NRDL was formed in 1946 to manage testing, decontamination, and disposition of US Navy ships contaminated by the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests in the Pacific.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/fallout/Content?oid=2141635|title=Fallout|last=Davis|first=Lisa|website=SF Weekly|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of ships that survived the atomic detonations were towed to Hunter's Point for detailed study and decontamination. Some of the ships were cleaned and sold for scrap. The aircraft carrier [[USS Independence (CVL-22)|USS Independence,]] which had been heavily damaged and contaminated with nuclear fallout by Operation Crossroads explosions in July 1946, was brought to the NRDL for study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socket.kongshem.com/2007/10/farallon-islands-nuclear-waste-dump.html|title=:: Socket ::: The Farallon Islands Nuclear Waste Dump|website=socket.kongshem.com|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of trying in vain to decontaminate the ship enough that it could be safely sold for scrap, the Navy ultimately packed the ship full of nuclear waste and scuttled the radioactive hulk off California near the [[Farallon Islands]] in January 1951. The ship's wreck was discovered resting upright under 790m of water in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/17/us/sunken-navy-carrier-revealed/index.html|title=Aircraft carrier that survived atomic blasts surveyed|last=CNN|first=Brad Lendon|website=CNN|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_27931161/scientists-find-radioactive-aircraft-carrier-off-san-francisco|title=Scientists find radioactive WWII aircraft carrier off San Francisco coast|website=www.mercurynews.com|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRDL used several buildings at the Hunter's Point shipyard from 1946 to 1969. Working with the newly formed [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|US Atomic Energy Commission]] (predecessor to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] established in 1974), the Navy conducted a wide variety of radiation experiments on materials and animals at the lab,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/hunters_point.htm|title=Hunters Point / San Francisco Naval Shipyard|last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the construction of a [[cyclotron]] on the site for use in radiation experiments and storage for various nuclear materials.

===Activities===
An article published 2 May 2001 in [[SF Weekly]] detailed various aspects of nuclear testing at NRDL from declassified records:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Quote|text= 
The NRDL often experimented with and disposed of nuclear material with little apparent concern that it was operating in the middle of a major metropolitan area. Among other things, historical documents show, scientists at the NRDL: 
* – Oversaw the dumping of huge amounts of contaminated sand and acid into San Francisco Bay after they were used in attempts to clean irradiated ships.
* – Spread radioactive material on- and off-base, as if it were fertilizer, to practice decontamination.
* – Burned radioactive fuel oil in a boiler, discharging the smoke into the atmosphere.
* – Sold radioactive ships as scrap metal to a private company in Alameda.
* – Hung a source of cobalt-60, a nuclear isotope that emits high-energy electromagnetic radiation similar to X-rays, in San Francisco Bay for two weeks, apparently just to see what would happen.
* – Conducted human experiments that included requiring people to drink radioactive elements.
* – Experimented with significant amounts of a wide variety of long-lived radiological poisons, including plutonium, cesium, uranium, thorium and radium.
* – Studied and disposed of thousands of irradiated mice, rats, dogs, goats, mules, and pigs, among other animals. At one point, the lab owned a ranch in Contra Costa County used specifically to raise animals for radiation testing.
* – Sought permission to dump 1,000 gallons of liquid waste containing "small amounts of fission products" into San Francisco Bay, as an experiment to study how tidal action would dilute the radioactivity. The experiment was meant as a precursor to the disposal of 1,000 gallons of liquid radioactive waste in the bay every day. (The documents do not say whether the experiment or the daily dumping occurred.) |source=http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/fallout/Content?oid=2141635|author=Davis, Lisa |title=Fallout|last=Davis|first=Lisa|website=SF Weekly|access-date=16 June 2016}}

===Contamination===
The first use of radioactive materials at NRDL predated the issuing of licenses by the Atomic Energy Commission, but the AEC later issued licenses for a broad spectrum of radioactive materials to be used in research at the NRDL. Radioactive materials specific to nuclear weapon testing were exempted from AEC licensing. For closure of the NRDL in 1969, the AEC issued licenses for decommissioning activities. AEC licenses for the shipyard and NRDL were terminated in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/decommissioning/complex/hunters-point-naval-shipyard.html|title=NRC: Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard|website=www.nrc.gov|access-date=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRDL testing and decontamination activities caused significant contamination of the shipyard site.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/42f5a316b6d2282488257d3300724f43/$FILE/60915851.pdf/RAD%20Program_Fact%20Sheet_Aug2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/42f5a316b6d2282488257d3300724f43/$FILE/60915851.pdf/RAD%20Program_Fact%20Sheet_Aug2014.pdf|title=United States Environmental Protection Agency Fact Sheet, Hunters Point Naval Shipyard Radiological Program|last=|first=|date=August 2014|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency Fact Sheet, Hunters Point Naval Shipyard Radiological Program|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NRDL and the military radiation training school at nearby [[Naval Station Treasure Island]] loaded the nuclear waste left from experiments into steel barrels and sent weekly barges to dump them offshore near the [[Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary|Gulf of the Farallons]], which is a US National Wildlife Refuge and a major commercial fishery. Between 1946 and 1970, records estimate the lab and naval station dumped an estimated 47,000 drums&lt;ref name="walrus.wr.usgs.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/farallon/radwaste.html|title=Gulf of the Farallones Disposal Issues – USGS PCMSC|website=walrus.wr.usgs.gov|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of nuclear waste in the Pacific Ocean 30 miles west of San Francisco, creating the first and largest offshore nuclear waste dump in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The USGS states the barrels contain only "low-level radioactive waste,"&lt;ref name="walrus.wr.usgs.gov" /&gt; but this is disputed by historical records and experts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304773104579268563658319196|title=Nuclear Waste Sits on Ocean Floor|last=Emshwiller|first=John R.|date=31 December 2013|last2=Searcey|first2=Dionne|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Navy completed a Historical Radiological Assessment of the Hunter's Point Shipyard in 2004, including the known NRDL facilities on the property, years after the SF Weekly article cited declassified documents showing that many sites and buildings used by NRDL were not included in the Navy's list of sites with potential for radiological contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0425/ML042580203.pdf |title=Historical Radiological Assessment, Volume II, Use of General Radioactive Materials, 1939-2003, Hunters Point Shipyard |author= |date=August 2004 |publisher=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission |accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the buildings formerly used by NRDL had been razed by that point.

The former shipyard site is still being decontaminated, and has been split into multiple parcels to allow the Navy to declare them clean and safe for redevelopment separately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While developer [[Lennar Corporation|Lennar]] has built and sold hundreds of new condominium units in the [[SF Shipyard]] development on the property,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/science/article/Housing-blooms-at-last-at-once-toxic-Hunters-6314858.php|title=Housing blooms at last at once-toxic Hunters Point shipyard site|website=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of regulators, activists, and cleanup workers have claimed that the site is still heavily contaminated and that the company contracted to handle the cleanup and testing, [[Tetra Tech]] has repeatedly violated established cleanup protocols,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Former-Contractors-Claim-Hunters-Point-Cleanup-is-Botched-259871511.html|title=Former Contractors Claim Hunters Point Cleanup is Botched|website=NBC Bay Area|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; deliberately falsified radiation test results at the site to falsely show that there is little remaining radiation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Former-Hunters-Point-Worker-Claims-Supervisors-Ordered-Him-to-Hide-Radiation-371723561.html|title=Worker Claims Supervisors Ordered Him to Hide Radiation|website=NBC Bay Area|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nuclear-news.net/2014/10/15/radiation-samples-falsified-to-make-hunters-point-look-clean/|title=Radiation samples falsified to make Hunters Point look clean|date=15 October 2014|website=nuclear-news|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fired employees who attempted to force workers to perform radiation tests as required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Regulators-Question-Hunters-Point-Radiation-Testing-303530541.html|title=Regulators Question Hunters Point Radiation Testing|website=NBC Bay Area|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bonemetabolism.svg|thumb|300 px|right|Bone is broken down by osteoclasts, and rebuilt by osteoblasts, both of which communicate through cytokine ([[TGF-β]], [[Insulin-like growth factor|IGF]]) signalling.]]
'''Ossification''' (or '''osteogenesis''') in [[bone remodeling]] is the process of laying down new [[bone]] material by [[Cell (biology)|cells]] called [[osteoblast]]s. It is synonymous with [[bone tissue]] formation. There are two processes resulting in the formation of normal, [[healthy]] [[bone tissue]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Caetano-Lopes J, Canhão H, Fonseca JE |title=Osteoblasts and bone formation |journal=Acta reumatológica portuguesa |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=103–10 |year=2007 |pmid=17572649}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intramembranous ossification]] is the direct laying down of bone into the primitive connective tissue ([[mesenchyme]]), while [[endochondral ossification]] involves [[cartilage]] as a precursor. 
In [[fracture healing]], endochondral [[osteogenesis]] is the most commonly occurring process, for example in fractures of long [[bones]] treated by [[plaster of Paris]], whereas fractures treated by [[open reduction and internal fixation]] with [[metal]] plates, [[screws]], pins, rods and nails may heal by intramembranous [[osteogenesis]].

[[Heterotopic ossification]] is a process resulting in the formation of [[bone tissue]] that is often atypical, at an extraskeletal location. [[Calcification]] is often confused with ossification. [[Calcification]] is synonymous with the formation of [[calcium]]-based salts and crystals within [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]. It is a process that occurs during ossification, but not ''vice versa''.

The exact mechanisms by which [[bone]] development is triggered remains unclear, but it involves [[growth factor]]s and [[cytokines]] in some way.

==Intramembranous ossification== 
[[Intramembranous ossification]] forms the [[flat bone]]s of the [[skull]], [[clavicle]] and [[mandible]].

==Endochondral ossification==
[[Endochondral ossification]] is the formation of long bones and other bones.
This requires a [[hyaline cartilage]] precursor. There are two centers of ossification for [[endochondral ossification]].

'''The primary center'''

In long bones, bone tissue first appears in the [[diaphysis]] (middle of shaft). [[Chondrocyte]]s multiply and form trebeculae. Cartilage is progressively eroded and replaced by hardened bone, extending towards the [[epiphysis]]. A [[perichondrium]] layer surrounding the cartilage forms the [[periosteum]], which generates osteogenic cells that then go on to make a collar that encircles the outside of the bone and remodels the medullary cavity on the inside.

The nutrient artery enters via the [[Nutrient canal|nutrient foramen]] from a small opening in the diaphysis. It invades the primary center of ossification, bringing osteogenic cells ([[osteoblast]]s on the outside, [[osteoclast]]s on the inside.) The canal of the [[Nutrient canal|nutrient foramen]] is directed away from more active end of bone when one end grows more than the other. When bone grows at same rate at both ends, the nutrient artery is perpendicular to the bone.

Most other bones (e.g. [[vertebra]]e) also have primary ossification centers, and bone is laid down in a similar manner.

'''Secondary centers'''

The secondary centers generally appear at the [[epiphysis]]. Secondary ossification mostly occurs after birth (except for distal femur and proximal [[tibia]] which occurs during 9th month of fetal development). The epiphyseal arteries and osteogenic cells invade the [[epiphysis]], depositing [[osteoblast]]s and [[osteoclast]]s which erode the cartilage and build bone. This occurs at both ends of long bones but only one end of digits and ribs.

==Evolution==
[[File:Lepisosteus oculatus larva at 22 days.png|thumb|A ''[[Lepisosteus oculatus|spotted gar]]'' larva at 22 days stained for [[cartilage]] (blue) and bone (red).]]
Several hypotheses have been proposed for how bone evolved as a structural element in [[vertebrates]]. One hypothesis is that bone developed from tissues that evolved to store [[mineral]]s. Specifically, calcium-based minerals were stored in cartilage and bone was an [[exaptation]] development from this calcified cartilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Donoghue PC, Sansom IJ |title=Origin and early evolution of vertebrate skeletonization |journal=Microsc. Res. Tech.|issue=5 |pages=352–72 |year=2002 |pmid=12430166 |doi=10.1002/jemt.10217 |volume=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other possibilities include bony tissue evolving as an [[Osmotic|osmotic barrier]], or as a protective structure.

The '''Oxygen minimum zone''' ('''OMZ'''), sometimes referred to as the '''shadow zone''', is the zone in which [[oxygen saturation]] in seawater in the [[ocean]] is at its lowest. This zone occurs at depths of about {{convert|200|to(-)|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, depending on local circumstances. OMZs are found worldwide, typically along the western coast of continents, in areas where an interplay of physical and biological processes concurrently lower the oxygen concentration (biological processes) and restrict the water from mixing with surrounding waters (physical processes), creating a “pool” of water where oxygen concentrations fall from the normal range of 4–6&amp;nbsp;mg/l to below 2&amp;nbsp;mg/l.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological Oceanography: An Introduction|last=Lalli|first=Carol|last2=Parsons|first2=Timothy|publisher=Oxford|year=1993|isbn=0 7506 2742 5|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical and biological processes ==
Surface ocean waters generally have oxygen concentrations close to equilibrium with the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. In general, colder waters hold more oxygen than warmer waters. As water moves out of the [[mixed layer]] into the [[thermocline]], it is exposed to a rain of organic matter from above. [[Aerobic bacteria]] feed on this organic matter; oxygen is used as part of the bacterial [[metabolism|metabolic]] process lowering its concentration within the water. Therefore, the concentration of oxygen in deep water is dependent on the amount of oxygen it had when it was at the surface minus depletion by deep sea organisms.

The downward flux of organic matter decreases sharply with depth, with 80–90% being consumed in the top {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.  The deep ocean thus has higher oxygen because rates of oxygen consumption are low compared with the supply of cold, oxygen-rich deep waters from polar regions. In the surface layers, oxygen is supplied by exchange with the atmosphere. Depths in between, however, have higher rates of oxygen consumption and lower rates of advective supply of oxygen-rich waters.  In much of the ocean, mixing processes enable the resupply of oxygen to these waters (i.e. waters that are part of the wind-driven subtropical gyre circulations are rapidly exchanged with the surface and never acquire a strong oxygen deficit).

The distribution of the open-ocean oxygen minimum zones is controlled by the large-scale ocean circulation as well as local physical as well as biological processes. For example, wind blowing parallel to the coast causes [[Ekman transport]] that upwells nutrients from deep water.  The increased nutrients support phytoplankton blooms, zooplankton grazing, and an overall productive [[food web]] at the surface.  The byproducts of these blooms and the subsequent grazing sink in the form of [[Particulate organic matter|particulate]] and [[Dissolved organic carbon|dissolved]] nutrients (from phytodetritus, dead organisms, fecal pellets, excretions, shed shells, scales, and other parts).  This "rain" of organic matter (see the [[biological pump]]) feeds the [[microbial loop]] and may lead to bacterial blooms in water below the [[Photic zone|euphotic zone]] due to the influx of nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dynamics of Marine Ecosystems: Biological-Physical interactions in the oceans.|last=Mann|first=K.H.|last2=Lazier|first2=J.R.N.|publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications|year=1991|isbn=1-4051-1118-6|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since oxygen is not being produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis below the euphotic zone, these microbes use up what oxygen is in the water as they break down the falling organic matter thus creating the lower oxygen conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Physical processes then constrain the mixing and isolate this low oxygen water from outside water. Vertical mixing is constrained due to the separation from the mixed layer by depth. Horizontal mixing is constrained by bathymetry and boundaries formed by interactions with sub-tropical gyres and other major current systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gnanadesikan|first=A.|last2=Bianchi|first2=D.|last3=Pradal|first3=M.A.|year=2013|title=Critical role for mesoscale eddy diffusion in supplying oxygen to hypoxic ocean waters|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=40|issue=19|pages=5194–5198|doi=10.1002/grl.50998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luyten|first=J|last2=Pedlosky|first2=J|last3=Stommel|first3=H|year=1983|title=The ventilated thermocline|journal=J Phys Oceanogr|volume=13|issue=2|pages=292–309|doi=10.1175/1520-0485(1983)013&lt;0292:tvt&gt;2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pedlosky|first=J.|year=1990|title=The dynamics of the oceanic subtropical gyres|journal=Science|volume=248|issue=4953|pages=316–322|doi=10.1126/science.248.4953.316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low oxygen water may spread (by advection) from under areas of high productivity up to these physical boundaries to create a stagnant pool of water with no direct connection to the ocean surface even though (as in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific) there may be relatively little organic matter falling from the surface.

== Life in the OMZ ==
Despite the low oxygen conditions, organisms have evolved to live in and around OMZs.  For those organisms, like the [[vampire squid]], special adaptations are needed to either make do with lesser amounts of oxygen or to extract oxygen from the water more efficiently. For example, the [[Gnathophausia ingens|giant red mysid]]  (''Gnathophausia ingens'') continues to live aerobically (using oxygen) in OMZs.  They have highly developed gills with large surface area and thin blood-to-water diffusion distance that enables effective removal of oxygen from the water (up to 90% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; removal from inhaled water) and an efficient circulatory system with high capacity and high blood concentration of a protein ([[hemocyanin]]) that readily binds oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Childress|first=J.J.|last2=Seibel|first2=B.A.|year=1998|title=Life at stable low oxygen levels: adaptations of animals to oceanic oxygen minimum layers.|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=201|pages=1223–1232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=N.K.|last2=Childress|first2=J.J.|year=1990|title=Adaptations to the Deep-Sea Oxygen Minimum Layer: Oxygen Binding by the Hemocyanin of the Bathypelagic Mysid, Gnathophausia ingens Dohrn|journal=Biological Bulletin|volume=178|issue=3|pages=286–294|doi=10.2307/1541830|jstor=1541830}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torres|first=J.J.|last2=Grigsby|first2=M.D.|last3=Clarke|first3=M.E.|year=2012|title=Aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in oxygen minimum layer fishes: the role of alcohol dehydrogenase|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=215|issue=11|pages=1905–1914|doi=10.1242/jeb.060236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strategy used by some classes of bacteria in the oxygen minimum zones is to use nitrate rather than oxygen, thus drawing down the concentrations of this important nutrient. This process is called [[denitrification]]. The oxygen minimum zones thus play an important role in regulating the productivity and ecological community structure of the global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature05392 |title=Spatial coupling of nitrogen inputs and losses in the ocean |year=2006 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Curtis |last2=Sarmiento |first2=Jorge L. |last3=Sigman |first3=Daniel M. |last4=Gruber |first4=Nicolas |last5=Dunne |first5=John P. |journal=Nature |volume=445 |issue=7124 |pages=163–7 |pmid=17215838}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, giant bacterial mats floating in the oxygen minimum zone off the west coast of [[South America]] may play a key role in the region's extremely rich fisheries as bacterial mats the size of [[Uruguay]] have been found there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Leahy |date=20 April 2010 |agency=Tierramérica |title=Giant Bacteria Colonise the Oceans |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=51117 |publisher=[[Inter Press Service]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624092254/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=51117 |archivedate=24 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing [[Earth system model]]s project considerable reductions in oxygen and other physico-chemical variables in the ocean due to ongoing climate change, with potential ramifications for ecosystems and people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mora |first1=C.|title=Biotic and Human Vulnerability to Projected Changes in Ocean Biogeochemistry over the 21st Century |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=11 |issue=10|pages=e1001682 |year=2013 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001682|display-authors=etal |pmid=24143135 |pmc=3797030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paleofeces''' (UK: Palaeofaeces) are ancient [[human feces]], often found as part of [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavations or surveys.  The term [[coprolite]] is often used interchangeably. Intact feces of ancient people may be found in caves in arid climates and in other locations with suitable preservation conditions.  They are studied to determine the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[health]] of the people who produced them through the analysis of seeds, small bones, and parasite eggs found inside. The feces can contain information about the person excreting the material as well as information about  the material itself. They can also be chemically analyzed for more in-depth information on the individual who excreted them, using [[lipid]] analysis and ancient [[DNA]] analysis. The success rate of usable DNA extraction is relatively high in paleofeces, making it more reliable than skeletal DNA retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;A Molecular Analysis of Dietary Diversity for Three Archaic Native Americans. Hendrik N. Poinar et al. PNAS 10 April 2001: 98 (8) 4317-4322. [DOI 10.1073/pnas.061014798]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The reason this analysis is possible at all is due to the digestive system not being entirely efficient, in the sense that not everything that passes through the digestive system is destroyed. Not all of the surviving material is recognizable, but some of it is. This material is generally the best indicator archaeologists can use to determine ancient diets, as no other part of the archaeological record is as direct an indicator.&lt;ref&gt;Feder, Kenneth L., Linking to the Past: A Brief Introduction to Archaeology. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process that preserves the feces in a way such that they can be analyzed later is called the [[Maillard reaction]]. This reaction creates a casing of sugar that preserves the feces from the elements. To extract and analyze the information contained within, researchers generally have to freeze the feces and grind it up into powder for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Divining Diet and Disease From DNA. Erik Stokstad. Science 28 July 2000: 289 (5479), 530-531. [DOI:10.1126/science.289.5479.530]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of research==

Analysis of archaeological feces has a relatively short history compared to many other archaeological materials. The founder of the discipline is  Dr. Eric O. Callen, who pioneered the subject in the late 1950s to mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Archaeological coprolite science: The legacy of Eric O. Callen (1912–1970)|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2005.11.032|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018206001027|year=2013|last1=Bryant|first1= V.|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|volume=237|issue=1|pages=51–66}}
&lt;/ref&gt; His early papers used coprolite analysis to investigate early Mexican diets, published in The Prehistory of the Tehuacan Valley: Environment, and Subsistence. Despite his work showing promise, archaeological coprolite studies remained a niche topic, with few other researchers becoming involved. After Callen's sudden death in 1970, his work was continued by [http://anthropology.tamu.edu/html/profile--vaughnbryant.html Vaughn Bryant] at [[Texas A&amp;M University]], Department of Anthropology. Coprolite analysis gradually became a topic of serious study. Today coprolite analysis in archaeology has increased exponentially, and they have provided important evidence concerning the evolution of human health and diet, in the Americas and other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biomolecular and micromorphological analysis of suspected faecal deposits at Neolithic Çatalhöyük, Turkey|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.03.031|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440311001166|year=2011|last1=Shillito|first1= L-M.|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=38|issue=8|pages=1869–1877|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous examples is the coprolite from [[Paisley Caves]], Oregon, which has provided some of the earliest evidence for the human occupation of North America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5877/786.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of analysis==

A wide variety of methods can be used to analyse ancient feces, ranging from microscopic to molecular. At a basic level the analysis of size and morphology can provide some information on whether they are likely to be human or from another animal. Analyzed contents can include those visible to the naked eye, such as seeds and other plant remains—to the microscopic, including pollen and phytoliths. Parasites in coprolites can give information on the living conditions and health of ancient populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879981713000405 | doi=10.1016/j.ijpp.2013.04.003 | volume=3 | title=Human intestinal parasites from a latrine in the 12th century Frankish castle of Saranda Kolones in Cyprus | journal=International Journal of Paleopathology | pages=218–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the molecular level, ancient [[DNA]] analysis can be used both to identify the species and to provide dietary information. A method using [[lipid]] analysis can also be used for species identification, based on the range of fecal [[sterols]] and [[bile acids]].&lt;ref&gt;http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/073/Ant0730086.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These molecules vary between species according to gut biochemistry, and so can distinguish between humans and other animals.

An example of researchers using paleofeces for the gathering of information using DNA analysis occurred at Hinds Cave in Texas by Hendrik Poinar and his team. The fecal samples obtained were over 2,000 years old. From the samples, Poinar was able to gather DNA samples using the analysis methods recounted above. From his research Poinar found that the feces belonged to three Native Americans, based on mtDNA similarities to present day Native Americans. Poinar also found DNA evidence of the food they ate. There were samples of buckthorn, acorns, ocotillo, nightshade and wild tobacco. No visible remnants of these plants were visible in the fecal matter. Along with plant material, there were also DNA sequences of animal species such as bighorn sheep and pronghorn antelope, both of which lack any evidence elsewhere in Hinds Cave, indicating that they were killed and consumed elsewhere.

This analysis of the diet was very helpful. Previously it was assumed that this population of Native Americans survived with berries being their main source of nutrients. From the paleofeces, it was determined that these assumptions were incorrect and in the approximately 2 days of food that are represented in a fecal sample, 2-4 animal species and 4-8 plant species were represented. The nutritional diversity of this archaic human population was rather extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;A Molecular Analysis of Dietary Diversity for Three Archaic Native Americans. Hendrik N. Poinar et al. PNAS 10 April 2001: 98 (8) 4317-4322. [DOI 10.1073/pnas.061014798]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the use of lipid analysis for identification of species is at the Neolithic site of [[Catalhoyuk]] in Turkey. Large midden deposits at the site are frequently found to contain fecal material &lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-archaeology.com/features/turkey-neolithic-life-at-catalhoyuk.htm&lt;/ref&gt; either as distinct coprolites or compressed 'cess pit' deposits. This was initially thought to be from dog on the basis of digested bone, however an analysis of the lipid profiles showed that many of the coprolites were actually from humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440311001166 | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.03.031 | volume=38 | title=Biomolecular and micromorphological analysis of suspected faecal deposits at Neolithic Çatalhöyük, Turkey | journal=Journal of Archaeological Science | pages=1869–1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of parasites from fecal material within cesspits has provided evidence for health and migration in past populations. For example, the identification of fish tapeworm eggs in Acre in the Crusader period indicate that this parasite was transported from northern Europe. The parasite was rarely seen in the Levant area during this time but was common in Northern Europe. It is suggested that it was brought to the region by the incoming Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879981711000337 | doi=10.1016/j.ijpp.2011.10.005 | volume=1 | title=Human intestinal parasites in crusader Acre: Evidence for migration with disease in the medieval period | journal=International Journal of Paleopathology | pages=132–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3234">'''[[regeneration (biology)|Regeneration]]''' is the ability for a [[Cell (biology)|cell]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], or [[organism]] to recover from damage. It can also be used to describe the ability of an [[ecosystem]]-- specifically, the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and its living [[population]]-- to recover from damage.

[[Resilience (ecology)|Resilience]] to minor [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]] is one characteristic feature of healthy ecosystems. Following major (lethal) disturbances, such as a [[forest fire|fire]] or pest outbreak in a forest, an immediate return to the previous [[dynamic equilibrium]] will not be possible. Instead, [[Pioneer species|pioneering species]] will occupy, compete for space, and establish themselves in the newly opened habitat. The new growth of seedlings and [[Assembly rules|community assembly]] process is known as regeneration in [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="Dietze08"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1890/07-0271.1 | last1=Dietze | first1=M.

In certain regions like [[Bushfires in Australia|Australia]], natural [[wildfire]] is a necessary condition for a cyclically [[Ecological stability|stable ecosystem]] with cyclic regeneration.

==Artificial disturbances==
While natural disturbances are usually fully compensated by the rules of ecological succession, human interference can significantly alter the regenerative [[homeostatic]] faculties of an ecosystem up to a degree that [[self-healing]] will not be possible. For regeneration to occur, active [[restoration ecology|restoration]] must be attempted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1492">In [[systems science]], a  '''sampled-data system''' is a [[control system]] in which a continuous-time [[plant (control theory)|plant]] is controlled with a digital device. Under periodic [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]], the sampled-data system is time-varying but also periodic; thus, it may be modeled by a simplified discrete-time system obtained by discretizing the plant. However, this discrete model does not capture the inter-sample behavior of the real system, which may be critical in a number of applications.

The analysis of sampled-data systems incorporating full-time information leads to challenging control problems with a rich mathematical structure. Many of these problems have only been solved recently.

'''Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law''' is a [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] affiliated to the Law Faculty at [[Stockholm University]]. The overall objective of the Institute is to disseminate knowledge about Scandinavian law and jurisprudence abroad by presenting Scandinavian law and legal theory to a wide readership in the English language. The Institute publishes '''''Scandinavian Studies in Law''''' (Sc.St.L.), a series of books presenting articles by Scandiavian jurists and legal experts. 

The Institute is led by an editorial board. The work is administrated by an appointed editor, and all activities of the Institute are conducted under the auspices of the  Stockholm University's Law Faculty.  The Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law was established in 1956. The founder of the Institute was the late professor [[Folke Schmidt]], a revered scholar at the Stockholm University.

In this context, [[Scandinavia]] is used as a generic term denoting five European countries: [[Denmark]], [[Finland]],  [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]. Denmark, Finland and Sweden are members of the European Union, Norway and Iceland are related to the community law via the EEA-agreement, creating the [[European Economic Area]]. Geographically, the Scandinavian peninsula comprises Norway and Sweden and the northernmost part of Finland.

To a large extent the Scandinavian countries have a common legal tradition and a history of extensive co-operation in many administrative matters. The Scandinavian countries share to a large extent their history, and are closely related by language and culture. Scandinavian law reflects therefore vivid traditions in legislative, administrative, and jurisprudential matters.

==''Scandinavian Studies in Law''==
The Institute publishes '''''Scandinavian Studies in Law''''' (Sc.St.L.), a series of books comprising articles on a variety of legal subjects. The Institute is led by an editorial board. The work is administrated by an appointed editor, and all activities of the Institute are conducted under the auspices of the  Stockholm University's Law Faculty.  

The series presents articles by Scandinavian jurists and lawyers. The first volume of Sc.St.L. was published in 1957. Since the beginning of the series more than 600 articles have been published.  Volumes 1-37, issued between 1957 and 1993, were yearbooks of a conventional kind, each reflecting a variety of legal topics. Beginning with volume 38 the material in the series has been arranged according to topic. A strategy making it possible to present more thorough and updated descriptions of developments in different legal sub-fields.

===Editor and Editorial Board===
The editor and editorial board of Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law is appointed by the Stockholm University's Law Faculty. Editors of the series have been [[Folke Schmidt]], Professor of Private Law (1956-1980); [[Anders Victorin]], Professor of Private Law (1980-1995); and [[Bill W. Dufwa]], Professor of Insurance Law. The present editor is: [[Peter Wahlgren]], LL.D., Professor, Law and Information Technology. 

The present members of the editorial board are: [[Ulf Bernitz]], LL.D., Professor emeritus in European Law, Stockholm University; [[Peter Seipel]], LL.D., Professor in Law and Information Technology, Stockholm University; and [[Said Mahmoudi]], LL.D., Professor in International Law, Stockholm University.

Financial support for the publishing of the series Scandinavian Studies in Law has been provided by the [[Association for the Publishing of Svensk Juristtidning]], the [[Edvard Cassel Foundation]], the [[Emil Heijne Foundation]], the [[Swedish Council for Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences]], and the Stockholm University Law Faculty Publishing Trust.

The Advisory Committee consists of [[Viðar Már Matthíasson]], Iceland, [[Ruth Nielsen]], Denmark, [[Tuomas Pöysti]], Finland, and [[Ole-Andreas Rognstad]], Norway.

===Contributors===
The series Scandinavian Studies in Law presents articles by Scandinavian jurists and legal experts. The series covers all aspects of the law. The vast majority of the contributions are written by academic scholars. Occasionally, articles by distinguished practitioners are also presented. 
Most of the articles presented in the series have never been published before, while some articles, previously published in the Scandinavian countries, have been updated and translated into English for the present series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7015">'''Umbrella species''' are [[species]] selected for making [[wildlife conservation|conservation]]-related decisions, typically because protecting these species indirectly protects the many other species that make up the ecological [[community (ecology)|community]] of its [[habitat]]. Species conservation can be subjective because it is hard to determine the status of many species. With millions of species of concern, the identification of selected ''[[keystone species]]'', ''[[flagship species]]'' or ''umbrella species'' makes conservation decisions easier. Umbrella species can be used to help select the locations of potential reserves, find the minimum size of these conservation areas or reserves, and to determine the composition, structure and processes of ecosystems.&lt;ref name="ROBERGE2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Roberge | first=Jean-Michel | last2=Angelstam | first2=Per | title=Usefulness of the Umbrella Species Concept as a Conservation Tool | journal=Conservation Biology | volume=18 | issue=1 | year=2004 | doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00450.x | pages=76–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

Two commonly used definitions are:

* "A wide-ranging species whose requirements include those of many other species"&lt;ref name="Groom 2006 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Groom | first=Martha | title=Principles of conservation biology | publisher=Sinauer Associates | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-87893-597-0 | oclc=70686894 | page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A species with large area requirements for which protection of the species offers protection to other species that share the same habitat&lt;ref name="OzakiIsono2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ozaki |first1=Kenichi |last2=Isono |first2=Masahiro |last3=Kawahara |first3=Takayuki |last4=Iida |first4=Shigeo |last5=Kudo |first5=Takuma |last6=Fukuyama |first6=Kenji |title=A Mechanistic Approach to Evaluation of Umbrella Species as Conservation Surrogates|journal=Conservation Biology |volume=20 |issue=5 |year=2006 |pages=1507–1515 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00444.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NOAA |year=2007 |title=Glossary |url=http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/coris_glossary/index.aspx?letter=u |accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other descriptions include:
* "Traditional umbrella species, relatively large-bodied and wide-ranging species of higher vertebrates"&lt;ref name=Launer1994&gt;{{cite journal | last=Launer | first=Alan E. | last2=Murphy | first2=Dennis D. | title=Umbrella species and the conservation of habitat fragments: A case of a threatened butterfly and a vanishing grassland ecosystem | journal=Biological Conservation | volume=69 | issue=2 | year=1994 | doi=10.1016/0006-3207(94)90054-x | pages=145–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In land use management ==

The use of umbrella species as a conservation tool is highly debated.  The term was first used by Wilcox (1984) &lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, Bruce A. 1984. "In situ conservation of genetic resources: Determinants of minimum area requirements." ''In National Parks, Conservation and Development, Proceedings of the World Congress on National Parks''. J.A. McNeely and K.R. Miller,  Smithsonian Institution Press, pp. 18–30.&lt;/ref&gt; who defined an umbrella species as one whose minimum area requirements are at least as comprehensive of the rest of the community for which protection is sought though the establishment and management of a protected area.

Some scientists have found that the [[umbrella effect (ecology)|umbrella effect]] provides a simpler way to manage ecological communities. Others feel that a combination of other tools establish better [[land management]] reserves to help protect more species than just using umbrella species alone. Individual invertebrate species can be good umbrella species because they can protect older, unique ecosystems. There have been cases where umbrella species have protected a large amount of area which has been beneficial to surrounding species. Dunk, Zielinski and Welsh (2006) reported that the reserves in Northern California (the Klamat h-Siskiyou forests), set aside for the [[northern spotted owl]], also protect [[mollusk]]s and [[salamander]]s within that habitat. They found that the reserves set aside for the northern spotted owl "serve as a reasonable coarse-filter umbrella species for the taxa evaluated", which were mollusks and salamanders.&lt;ref&gt;Dunk, Jeffrey R., William J. Zielinkski and Hartwell H. Walsh, Jr. 2006. "Evaluating reserves for species richness and representation in northern California." ''Diversity and Distributions'', Vol. 12, 434-442.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Endangered Species Act (US) ==

The [[bay checkerspot butterfly]] has been on the [[Endangered Species List]] since 1987. Launer and Murphy (1994) tried to determine whether this butterfly could be considered an umbrella species in protecting the native grassland it inhabits.  They discovered that the [[Endangered Species Act]] has a loophole excluding federally protected plants on private property. However, the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] reinforces state conservation regulations.&lt;ref name=Launer1994/&gt; Using the Endangered Species Act to protect termed umbrella species and their habitats can be controversial because they are not as well enforced in some states as others (such as California) to protect overall [[biodiversity]].

== Examples ==

# [[Northern spotted owl]]s and [[old-growth forest]]: Molluscs and salamanders are within the protective boundaries of the northern spotted owl.
# [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]] and grasslands
# [[Siberian tiger|Amur tigers]] in the Russian Far East are considered umbrella/keystone species due to their impact on the deer and boar in their ecosystem&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Russia's Tough Tigers - National Zoo{{!}} FONZ|url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/2008/1/Amur_tigers.cfm|website=nationalzoo.si.edu|access-date=2016-02-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220033557/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/publications/zoogoer/2008/1/amur_tigers.cfm|archivedate=2016-02-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usuda was the first deep-space antenna constructed with beam-waveguide technology.  Although this construction dramatically simplifies installation and maintenance of electronics, it was previously thought to offer poor noise performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Similar huge antennas are used by the deep space networks of the [[NASA Deep Space Network|USA]], [[Chinese Deep Space Network|China]], [[Soviet Deep Space Network|Russia]], [[ESTRACK|Europe]], and [[Indian Deep Space Network|India]].

Because the 64 meter antenna is getting old, JAXA is building a new antenna nearby.  This antenna will be slightly smaller (54 meters in diameter) but have better surface accuracy and hence be capable of working at the higher Ka-band frequencies.  This will increase the potential data throughput despite the smaller size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Toward a New Era of Deep Space Exploration: Kenji Numata, Project Manager, Ground Station for Deep Space Exploration and Telecommunication Project |url=http://global.jaxa.jp/article/2017/interview/vol98/ |publisher=JAXA |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waterway restoration''' is the activity of restoring a [[canal]] or [[river]], including special features such as [[warehouse]] buildings, [[Lock (water transport)|locks]], [[boat lift]]s, and boats. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], the focus of waterway restoration is on improving [[navigability]], while in [[Australia]] the term may also include improvements to [[water quality]]. ''(For water quality improvement activity in the US and UK see [[stream restoration]].)''

==Waterway restoration in Canada==
===Shubenacadie Canal===
The [[Shubenacadie Canal]] Commission was formed in 1986 to oversee the future of this waterway. Locks three and five have been restored, water levels in the connecting lakes have been stabilized and a visitor center opened. The ten year business plan [http://shubie.chebucto.org/documents/overview_000.pdf] for 2007-2016 aims to save four more locks and  rebuild four water control structures to make the route open for small boats from Lake Banook to the village of [[Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia|Shubenacadie]].

===Soulanges Canal===
The [[Soulanges Canal]] closed in 1958. Today there are plans to reopen the canal to pleasure boats. The mission of the Régie intermunicipale du canal de Soulanges is to manage the development of a  tourism development as part of the reopening of the canal. [http://www.canalsoulanges.com/default2.htm]

==Waterway restoration in Finland==
===Suvorov military canals===

[[Suvorov military canals]] (Suvorov canals) is a series of four open [[canal]]s on [[Saimaa|Saimaa lake]] in Finland. Apart from the Kutvele canal, the other three canals spent 200 years almost untouched from early 19th century until 2003, when [[Finnish National Board of Antiquities]] began restoration works on them. Now they have been turned into tourist attractions.

===Tar canals===

The tar canals in [[Kajaani]] were canals and locks built to pass the Koivukoski and Ämmäkoski rapids. First used in 1846, the locks were vital in the transportation of wood [[pine tar]] to [[Oulu]]. The worn down canals were closed in 1915. Refurbished Ämmäkoski lock was re-opened in 1984, but the Koivukoski canal has been totally dismantled and the site now houses a hydroelectric power plant. The refurbished canal is not used for transport, but in summertime, tar boat shows are organised for tourists.&lt;ref&gt; City of [[Kajaani]].

==Waterway restoration in the United Kingdom==
[[File:Droitwich canal restoration.jpg|thumb|Excavation work at [[Salwarpe]] on the Droitwich Canal during 1978 Waterway Recovery Group summer work camp.]]
Due to competition from the [[railway]]s and the narrow design of most [[United Kingdom|UK]] canals (which prevented the carriage of economically sized bulk loads), large parts of the [[list of canals in the United Kingdom|UK's canal system]] were abandoned in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The rise of the leisure industry in the 1950s meant that the complete abandonment of the remaining canals was avoided.

The increasing use of canals for leisure purposes led some people to consider restoring some of those that had been abandoned. At first, progress was slow due to the lack of funding, with most of the work having to be done manually by volunteers.

As the leisure industry grew, the economic benefits of having a canal became more apparent and some state funding started to appear. At the same time public interest increased the size of various volunteer groups.

At the present time, canal restoration in the UK is carried out by a mixture of volunteers and professionals working on a large variety of projects.

'''Wilhelm (William) Dittenberger''' (August 31, 1840 in [[Heidelberg]] – December 29, 1906 in [[Halle (Saale)]]) was a German [[philologist]] in classical epigraphy.

==Life==
Wilhelm Dittenberger was the son of the Protestant theologian [[Wilhelm Theophor Dittenberger]]. After attending school in [[Heidelberg]] and [[Weimar]] (then directed by [[Hermann Sauppe]]), he studied classical philology at Jena from 1859 and transferred to [[Göttingen]] in 1861, where he was reunited with Hermann Sauppe and received his doctorate at the beginning of 1863 for a work on the Athenian [[ephebes]]. From autumn of that year, he taught at the Göttingen Gymnasium while he completed his [[habilitation]] on [[Sallust]] at the [[University of Göttingen]]. Initially, Dittenberger remained a schoolteacher, becoming a teacher at the Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium in [[Berlin]] in 1865, at the [[Rudolstadt]] Gymnasium from 1867, and at the gymnasium in [[Quedlinburg]] from 1873 to 1874. In 1874 he was appointed Professor of Classical Philology at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]]. He was a corresponding member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] and an ordinary member of the [[German Archaeological Institute]].

Dittenberger's research focus was Greek epigraphy. His name is associated above all with the edited collections ''Sylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum'' (later re-edited by [[Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen]]) and ''Orientis Graeci Inscriptiones Selectae''. For ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'', Dittenberger was responsible for the Athenian inscriptions of the Roman period, of [[Megaris]] and [[Boeotia]], and of [[Phocis]], [[Lokris]], [[Aetolia]], [[Acarnania]] and the [[Ionian Islands]]. In addition he edited the inscriptions of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] (with [[Karl Purgold]]) and the 6th to 11th editions of the widely used commentary on [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' begun by [[Friedrich Kraner]].

His son, Heinrich Dittenberger (1875–1952), was a lawyer in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], [[Leipzig]], and [[Berlin]], as well as Chief Director of the [[German Bar Association]] from 1910 to 1933.&lt;ref&gt;''Kürschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender.'' Vol. 7, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death in 1907, his library was acquired by the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], as was the library of [[Johannes Vahlen]], slightly later (1913). Together, the two libraries form the ''Dittenberger-Vahlen Collectionn of Classical Texts'', containing over 15,000 books and 17,000 reprints. In 2000, the university began the digitisation of this collection with the assistance of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].

Dittenberger's tomb is located in the Nordfriedhof in Halle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32513">Women are often under-represented in the fields of engineering, both in academia and in the profession of engineering, yet many have contributed to the diverse fields of engineering historically and currently.&lt;ref name="MentorNet 2003"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK36356/|title=The Underrepresentation of Women in Engineering and Related Sciences: Pursuing Two Complementary Paths to Parity|last=MentorNet|date=2003|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of organizations and programs have been created to understand and overcome this tradition of gender disparity. Some have decried this gender gap, saying that it indicates the absence of potential talent.&lt;ref name="MentorNet 2003"/&gt; Though the gender gap as a whole is narrowing, there is still a growing gap with minority women compared to their white counterparts.&lt;ref name="MentorNet 2003"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of women in engineering}}
The history of women as designers and builders of machines and structures predates the development of engineering as a trade. Prior to the creation of the term "[[engineer]]" in the 11th century, women had contributed to the technological advancement of societies around the globe, including [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (350 or 370–415 AD), who is credited with the invention of the [[hydrometer]]. By the 19th century, women who participated in engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. [[Ada Lovelace]] was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning her collaboration with [[Charles Babbage]] on his [[analytical engine]] that would earn her the designation of the "first computer programmer." In the early years of the 20th century, greater numbers of women began to be admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as anomalies by the men in their departments.

The first University to award an engineering's bachelor's degree for women was [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Elizabeth Bragg was the recipient of a bachelor's degree in [[civil engineering]] in 1876, becoming the first female engineer in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="SWE"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Society of Women Engineers Blog|title=History of Women Engineers|url=http://alltogether.swe.org/2016/03/women-in-engineering-history/|website=All Together Society Of Women Engineers|publisher=Society of Women Engineers|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 19th century, it was very rare for women to earn bachelor's degree in any field because they did not have the opportunity to enroll in universities due to gender disparities. Some universities started to admit women to their colleges by the early 1800s and by the mid-1800s they started to admit them into all academic programs including engineering.&lt;ref name="SWE" /&gt;{{Women in society sidebar}}

The entry of the United States into [[World War II]] created a serious shortage of engineering talent in that country as men were drafted into the armed forces. To address the shortage, initiatives like [[General Electric Corporation|GE]] on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics and the [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] Engineering Program among others created new opportunities for women in engineering.  [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] partnered with [[Cornell]], [[Penn State]], [[Purdue]], the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Texas]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], and [[Iowa State University]] to create an engineering curriculum that lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.&lt;ref name="Bix"&gt;Bix, Amy Sue, "'Engineeresses' Invade Campus: Four decades of debate over technical coeducation." ''IEEE Technology and Society Magazine,'' Vol. 19 Nr. 1 (Spring 2000), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, since the female representation in the engineering field, there were barely public attacks on women. Chiefly, these attacks were kept quiet inside institutions due to the fact that women did not pressure aggressively to shift the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]] between men and women in the engineering field. Another reason why these “attacks” were kept private is due to how men believed that it was impossible for engineering to stop being a male-dominated field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bix|first1=Amy Sue|title=Girls coming to tech! : a history of American engineering education for women|date=2013|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262019545|pages=14–43|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=773eea71-2e88-4f93-bd10-b06fb8ced6d5%40sessionmgr103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=691931&amp;db=nlebk|ref=Girls Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's roles in the workforce, specifically in engineering fields changed greatly during the Post–World War II period. As women started to marry at later ages, have fewer children, divorce more frequently and stopped depending on [[Breadwinner model|male breadwinners]] for economic support, they started to become even more active in the engineering labor force despite the fact that their salaries were less than men's.&lt;ref name="Power Status Stereotypes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Juemei|title=The impact of power status on gender stereotypes, sexism, and gender discrimination toward women in the workplace and the career identity development of women|date=2016|publisher=The University of North Dakota|location=The University of North Dakota|pages=1–20|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women also played a crucial role in programming the [[ENIAC]] from its construction during the [[World War II]] period through the next several decades. Originally recruited by the Army in 1943, female ENIAC programmers made considerable advancements in [[Computer programming|programming]] techniques, such as the invention of breakpoints, now a standard debugging tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbate|first1=Janet|title=Recoding Gender: Women's Changing Participation in Computing|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/recoding-gender|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the wartime shortage of engineers, women also made inroads in engineering fields due to the gradual increase in public universities admitting female students. For example, [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] began to admit women engineering students in 1952, while the [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris, a premier French engineering institution, began to admit female students in 1972.

==Factors contributing to lower female participation==
===Gender stereotypes===

[[Stereotype threat]] may contribute to the under-representation of women in engineering. Because engineering is a traditionally male-dominated field, women may be less confident about their abilities, even when performing equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ruff|first2=Chloe|last3=Paretti|first3=Marie C.|date=2013|title=The impact of engineering identification and stereotypes on undergraduate women’s achievement and persistence in engineering|journal=Social Psychology of Education An International Journal|last1=Jones|first1=Brett D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a young age, girls do not express the same level of interest in engineering as boys, possibly due in part to [[gender stereotypes]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite paper|last=Hill|first=Catherine|last2=Corbett|first2=Christine|last3=St. Rose|first3=Andresse|year=2010|title=Why So Few?: Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED509653.pdf|publisher=[[AAUW]]|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also significant evidence of the remaining presence of [[implicit bias]] against female engineers, due to the belief that men are mathematically superior and better suited to engineering jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women who persist are able to overcome these difficulties, enabling them to find fulfilling and rewarding experiences in the engineering profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bilimoria|first2=Diana|last3=Perelli|first3=Sheri|date=2013|title=Why they stay: women persisting in US engineering careers|journal=Career Development International|volume=18.2|pages=139–154|last1=Buse|first1=Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Due to this [[gender bias]], women's choice in entering an engineering field for college is also highly correlated to the background and exposure they have had with [[mathematics]] and other science courses during high school. Most women that do choose to study engineering have significant experience with regarding themselves better at these types of courses and as a result, think they are capable of studying in a male-dominated field.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell" /&gt;

Women's [[self-efficacy]] is also a contributor to the [[gender stereotype]] that plays a role in the underrepresentation of women in engineering.  Women's ability to think critically that they can be successful and perform accomplishments is correlated to the choices they have when choosing a college career. Women that show high self-efficacy personalities are more prone to choose to study in the engineering field. Self-efficacy is also correlated to gender roles because men often present higher self-efficacy than women, which can also be a cause to why when choosing a major, most women opt to not choose the engineering major.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaisdell|first1=Stephanie|title=Factors In The Underrepresentation Of Women In Science and Engineering: A Review Of The Literature|journal=Penn State University|date=1994|pages=167–168|url=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57727/57415|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower rates of female students in engineering degree programs===
Over the past few years 40 percent of women are leaving the engineering field, there are many factors leading to why they don't go into engineering because of women being judged about going into a difficult major such as engineering, working in difficult workplace conditions. According to the Society of Women Engineers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/female-engineers_n_5668504.html|title=40 Percent Of Female Engineers Are Leaving The Field. This Might Be Why.|last=Adams|first=Rebecca|date=2014-08-12|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; one in four female leave the field after a certain age.

Women are under-represented in engineering education programs as in the workforce (see [[Women in engineering#Statistics|Statistics]]). Enrollment and graduation rates of women in post-secondary engineering programs are very important determinants of how many women go on to become engineers. Because undergraduate degrees are acknowledged as the "latest point of standard entry into scientific fields", the under-representation of women in undergraduate programs contributes directly to under-representation in scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Programs for Undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering: Issues, Problems, and Solutions |journal=Gender &amp; Society |first=Mary |last=Fox|first2=Gerhard |last2=Sonnert |first3=Irina |last3=Nikiforova | year=2011| volume=25 | issue=5| page=591 | doi=10.1177/0891243211416809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the United States, women who hold degrees in science, technology, and engineering fields are less likely than their male counterparts to have jobs in those fields.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This degree disparity varies across engineering disciplines. Women tend to be more interested in the engineering disciplines that have societal and humane developments, such as agricultural and [[environmental engineering]]. They are therefore well-represented in environmental and [[biomedical engineering]] degree programs, receiving 40-50% of awarded degrees in the U.S. (2014–15), women are far less likely to receive degrees in fields like [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[computer engineering]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoder|first=Brian L.|year=2015|title=Engineering by the Numbers|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/engineering_by_the_numbers.pdf|journal=|publisher=American Society for Engineering Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="franzway" /&gt;

A study made by the [[Harvard Business Review]] discussed the reasons why the rates of women representation in the engineering field are still low. The study discovered that rates of female students in engineering programs are continuous because of the collaboration aspects in the field. The results of the study chiefly determined how women are treated differently in group works in which there are more male than female members and how male members “excluded women from the real engineering work”. Aside from this, women in this study also described how professors treated female students differently “just because they were women”.&lt;ref name="HBR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silbey|first1=Susan S.|title=Why Do So Many Women Who Study Engineering Leave the Field?|url=https://hbr.org/2016/08/why-do-so-many-women-who-study-engineering-leave-the-field|website=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that fewer women enroll in engineering programs across the nation, the representation of women in STEM-based careers can potentially increase when college and university administrators work on implementing mentoring programs and work-life policies for women. 
Research shows that these rates have a hard time increasing since women are judged as less competent than men to perform supposedly “masculine jobs”.&lt;ref name="Eric" /&gt;

=== Engineering culture ===
[[File:2009 Bay Area Maker Faire - Jeri.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Autodidacticism|Autodidact]] computer chip designer and inventor, [[Jeri Ellsworth]], at the [https://makerfaire.com/bay-area/ Bay Area "Maker Faire"] in 2009.|alt=Jeri Ellsworth]]Another possible reason for lower female participation in engineering fields is the prevalence of values "associated with the male [[gender role]]" in workplace culture.&lt;ref name="franzway" /&gt;  For example, some women in engineering have found it difficult to re-enter the workforce after a period of absence. Because men are less likely to take time off to raise a family, this disproportionately affects women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evetts|first1=Julia|title=Women and management in engineering: The 'glass ceiling' for|journal=Women in Management Review|date=1993|volume=8.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are also associated with taking leadership roles in the workplace. By holding a position of power over the women, they may create an uncomfortable environment for them. For example, lower pay, more responsibilities, less appreciation as compared to men.

[[Communication]] is also a contributing factor to the divide between men and women in the workplace. A male to male communication is said to be more direct,&lt;ref name=Dutta&gt;Dutta, Debalina1. "Sustaining The Pipeline: Experiences Of International Female Engineers In U.S. Graduate Programs." Journal of Engineering Education 104.3 (2015): 326-344. Education Source.&lt;/ref&gt;
but when a man explains a task to a woman, they tend to talk down, or “dumb down” terms. This comes from the [[stereotype]] that men are more qualified than women for engineering, causing men to treat women as inferiors instead of equals.

Part of the [[Male privilege|male dominance]] in the engineering field is explained by their perception towards engineering itself. A study in 1964 found that both women and men believed that engineering was in fact masculine.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaisdell|first1=Stephanie|title=Factors In The Underrepresentation Of Women In Science And Engineering: A Review Of The Literature|journal=Penn State University|date=1994|pages=169–170|ref=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57727/57415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The masculinity dominating engineering majors and fields proves the issues that men themselves believe that they “naturally” excel in fields related to mathematics and sciences while women “naturally” excel in linguistics and liberal arts. In the past few decades, women's representation in the workforce in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] fields, specifically engineering, has significantly improved. In 1960 women made up around 1% of all the engineers and by the year 2000 women have made up 11% of all engineers.&lt;ref name="Eric"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill, Ph.D.|first1=Catherine|last2=Corbett|first2=Christiane|last3=St. Rose, Ed.D.|first3=Andresse|title=Why So Few?: Women In Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED509653|website=ERIC Institute of Education Sciences|publisher=AAUW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several colleges and universities nationwide want to decrease the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]] between men and women in the engineering field by recruiting more women into their programs. The strategies used for recruiting more female undergraduate students are: increasing women's exposure to stem-courses during high school, planting the idea of positivism relating gender from the engineering culture, producing a more female-friendly environment inside and outside the classroom.  These strategies have helped institutions encourage more women to enroll in engineering programs as well as other [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]-based majors. 
For universities to encourage women to enroll in their [[graduate programs]], institutions have to emphasize the importance of recruiting women, emphasize the importance of STEM education in the undergraduate level, offer financial aid, and develop more efficient methods for recruiting women to their programs.&lt;ref name="Recruiting"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Guide to Recruiting and Advancing Women Scientists and Engineers in Academia, Committee on Women in Science and Engineering, and National Research Council|title=To Recruit and Advance : Women Students and Faculty in U.S. Science and Engineering|date=2006|publisher=National Academic Press|pages=26-26|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Females are underrepresented as both graduate students in engineering and working engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/cwse/S_E_stats.pdf |title=Data on Women in S&amp;E |page=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819125228/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/cwse/S_E_stats.pdf |archivedate=August 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/cwsem/index.htm|title=Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine|publisher=Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of bachelor's degrees awarded to women dropped from 20.4% in 2003, down to 17.8% in 2009, and back up to 18.9% in 2012.&lt;ref name="Yoder"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yoder|first1=Brian|title=Engineering by the Numbers|url=http://www.asee.org/papers-and-publications/publications/11-47.pdf|website=ASEE|publisher=American Society for Engineering Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's underrepresentation in the engineering workforce varies by field. In the year 2008 women [[Mechanical Engineers]] made up 6.7%, [[Electrical engineering|Electrical]] and [[Electronic engineering|Electronics]] made 7.7%, [[Aerospace engineering|Aerospace]] and [[Civil engineering|Civil]] made 10.4%, [[Chemical engineering|Chemical]] made 13.1% and [[Computer engineering|Computer]] and [[Software engineer|Software Engineers]] made up 20.9% of the workforce. These values are even more outnumbered while quantifying the number of women who hold [[doctorates]].&lt;ref name="Eric" /&gt;

The percentage of [[master's degrees]] awarded to women has not changed much from 2003 (22.3%) to 2012 (23.1%).&lt;ref name="Yoder" /&gt; The percentage of doctoral degrees awarded to women in engineering increased from 11.6% in 1995, to 17.4% in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06308/pdf/tab2.pdf | title=Table 2. Doctorates awarded to women, by field of study: 1995–2004| publisher=National Science Foundation|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 21.1% in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Jaschik,
[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/09/14/doctorates Women Lead in Doctorates], ''Inside Higher Ed,'' September 14, 2010 (accessed June 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; then to 22.2% in 2012.&lt;ref name=Yoder /&gt;

Since 1997, the percentage of Asian females enrolling in engineering majors has risen from about 30% to 34% but somehow also dropped in 2002. African American females have increased their representation in engineering from 21% to 33% in the same time frame. Mexican American (Chicana) and Puerto Rican females have had an increase in their representation from 25% to 31%. Even if ethnicities are included in these statistics, men from all ethnicities still outnumber the proportion of women who enroll in engineering bachelor programs.&lt;ref name="Recruiting" /&gt;

There is a significant drop-off rate regarding the number of women who earn a bachelor's degree and the women who afterward enroll in graduate school. Over the last 35 years, women have been more likely than men to enroll in graduate school right after receiving their bachelor's degree. Women who do not enroll in a graduate program right after earning their bachelor's degree tend to be caregivers who face work-family conflicts in the context of family women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Guide to Recruiting and Advancing Women Scientists and Engineers in Academia|last2=Committee on Women in Science and Engineering|last3=National Research Council|title=To Recruit and Advance : Women Students and Faculty in U.S. Science and Engineering|pages=14–47|ref=Recruiting}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The workforce remains the area of lowest representation for women. In 2009, women comprised 48% of the total workforce, but only 14% of the engineering workforce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Australia===
Only 14% of engineers in [[Australia]] are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robogals.org/about/who-what-why/|title=Who, What, Why|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Robogals|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retention of female engineers is also disproportionally low; in 2006, 62.6% of qualified male engineers were employed in engineering professions, as opposed to 47.1% of qualified female engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaspura|first=Andre|year=2014|title=THE ENGINEERING PROFESSION: A STATISTICAL OVERVIEW|url=http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/shado/Resources/the_engineering_profession_a_statistical_overview_11th_ed._october_2014.pd|journal=|publisher=Engineers Australia|volume=11|pages=117|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Though women tend to make up more than half of the undergraduate population in [[Canada]], the number of women in engineering is disproportionately low.&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/career-advice/why-more-women-arent-becoming-engineers/article1216432/|title=Why more women aren't becoming engineers |last=Myers|first=Jennifer|date=9 Nov 2010|accessdate=24 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in 2001, 21 percent of students in engineering programs were female, by 2009, this had fallen to 17 percent.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt; One commentator attributed this drop to a number of factors, such as the failure of higher education programs to explain how engineering can improve others' lives, a lack of awareness of what engineers do, and discomfort of being in a male-dominated environment and the perception that women must adapt to fit in.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt;

In the 1990s, undergraduate enrollment of women in engineering fluctuated from 17 to 18%, while in 2001, it rose to 20.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/pr_women.cfm|title=Women in Engineering|publisher=Engineers Canada|accessdate=30 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 17.7% of students in undergraduate engineering were women.&lt;ref name="Canada1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/files/w_report_enrolment_eng.pdf|title=Canadian Engineers for Tomorrow: Trends in Engineering Enrolment and Degrees Awarded 2006 to 2010|publisher=Engineers Canada|accessdate=30 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female undergraduate enrollment was highest in 2010 in [[Environmental engineering|environmental]], [[Biosystems engineering|biosystems]], and [[geological engineering]].&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;

The number of women enrolled in undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral engineering programs tends to vary by province, with the highest number in [[Saskatchewan]],  [[Alberta]], and [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;

On average, 11% of engineering faculty are women and the percentage of leadership roles held by women is an average of 9%.&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt; The [[University of Toronto]] has the highest female faculty rate in Canada at 17% and [[École Polytechnique de Montréal]],  [[University of British Columbia]], and [[Dalhousie University]] all have a female faculty rate of 13%.&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;

In 2011, the INWES Education and Research Institute (ERI) held a national workshop, Canadian Committee of Women in Engineering (CCWE+20), to determine ways of increasing the number of women in the engineering field in Canada.&lt;ref name="ccwe20"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uottawa.ca/media/media-release-2376.html|title=Canada needs more women engineers—how do we get there?|date=26 Jul 2011|accessdate=24 May 2013|publisher=University of Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCWE+20 identified a goal of increasing women's interest in engineering by 2.6 percent by 2016 to a total of 25 percent through more incentives such as through collaboration and special projects.&lt;ref name="ccwe20" /&gt; The workshop identifies early education as one of the main barriers in addition to other factors, such as: "the popular culture of their generation, the guidance they receive on course selection in high school and the extent to which their parents, teachers, and counselors recognize engineering as an appropriate and legitimate career choice for women."&lt;ref name="ccwe20" /&gt; The workshop report compares enrollment, teaching, and professional statistics from the goals identified in 1997 compared to the actual data from 2009, outlining areas of improvement (see table, right).
