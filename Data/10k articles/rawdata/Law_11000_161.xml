'''Authority''' has been considered in [[Sociological theory|sociological]] terms as indicating the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] or socially approved use of power. It is the legitimate power which one person or a group holds and exercises over another. The element of legitimacy is vital to the notion of authority and is the main means by which authority is distinguished from the more general concept of power. Power can be exerted by the use of force or [[violence]]. Authority, by contrast, depends on the acceptance by [[subordinate]]s of the right of those above them to give them orders or [[wiktionary:directive|directive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Giddens, Sociology. London: Polity Press, 1997:581&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber in "Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations for the 21st Century", translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters.  pp. 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Authorities==
The types of political authority were first defined by [[Max Weber]] in his essay "[[Politics as a Vocation]]" and his other writings in 1919-1920.  In this essay he emphasized that the political authority that controlled the state can be composed of the following types of authority, or what is called in German, ''Herrschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, Palgrave Books 2015, pp. 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Traditional authority|Traditional Authority]]:''' Power legitimized by respect for long-established cultural patterns.

'''[[Charismatic authority|Charismatic Authority]]:''' Power legitimized by extraordinary personal abilities that inspire devotion and obedience.

'''[[Rational-legal authority|Rational-Legal Authority]]:''' Also known as bureaucratic authority, is when power is legitimized by legally enacted rules and regulations such as governments.

==Max Weber on authority==&lt;!-- [[Herrschaft (sociology)]] redirects here --&gt;
{{See also|Monopoly on violence}}
[[Max Weber]], in his sociological and philosophical work, identified and distinguished three types of legitimate domination (''Herrschaft'' in German, which generally means 'domination' or 'rule'), that have sometimes been rendered in English translation as types of authority, because [[Dominance (ethology)|domination]] is not seen as a political concept in the first place.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Weber defined domination (authority) as the chance of commands being obeyed by a specifiable group of people.  Legitimate authority is that which is recognized as legitimate and justified by both the ruler and the ruled.Legitimated rule results in what Weber called the monopoly over the use of coercive violence in a given territory.&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, Palgrave Books 2015, pp. 136&lt;/ref&gt;  In the modern world, such authority is typically delegated to a police and court system.

Weber divided legitimate authority into three types:

*The first type discussed by Weber is ''[[rational-legal authority]]''. It is that form of authority which depends for its [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] on formal rules and established laws of the state, which are usually written down and are often very complex. The power of the rational legal authority is mentioned in the constitution. Modern societies depend on legal-rational authority. Government officials are the best example of this form of authority, which is prevalent all over the world.
*The second type of authority, ''[[traditional authority]]'', derives from long-established customs, habits and social structures. When power passes from one generation to another, it is known as traditional authority. The rule of hereditary [[Monarchy|monarchs]] furnishes an obvious example. The [[Tudor dynasty]] in England and the ruling families of [[Mewar]] in [[Rajasthan]] (India) are some examples of traditional authority.
* The third form of authority is ''[[charismatic authority]]''. Here, the charisma of the individual or the leader plays an important role. Charismatic authority is that authority which is derived from the leader's claims to a higher power or inspiration that is supported by his or her followers. Examples in this regard can be [[NT Rama Rao]], a matinee idol, who went on to become one of the most powerful Chief Ministers of [[Andhra Pradesh]].

History has witnessed several [[Social movement|social movements]] or [[Revolution|revolutions]] against a system of traditional or legal-rational authority started by Charismatic authorities. According to Weber, what distinguishes authority from [[coercion]], [[Force (law)|force]] and [[Coercion|power]] on the one hand, and leadership, [[persuasion]] and [[Social influence|influence]] on the other hand, is legitimacy. Superiors, he states, feel that they have a right to issue commands; subordinates perceive an obligation to obey. Social scientists{{who|date=November 2010}} agree that authority is but one of several resources available to incumbents in formal positions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} For example, a Head of State is dependent upon a similar nesting of authority. His legitimacy must be acknowledged, not just by citizens, but by those who control other valued resources: his immediate staff, his cabinet, military leaders and in the long run, the administration and political apparatus of the entire society.

Authority can be created expressly when public entities act publicly, using the same means to communicate the grant of authority to their agents that they use to communicate this to third parties, apparent authority describes the situation when a principal has placed restrictions on an agent that are not known to a third party, and restrictions on government agents are accomplished in the open, through laws and regulations. In this setting, all parties concerned is assumed or supposed to know the laws and regulations of government.

Recently the concept of authority has also been discussed as a guiding principle in human–machine interaction design.&lt;ref&gt;Flemisch, F., Heesen, M., Hesse, T., Kelsch, J., Schieben, A., &amp; Beller, J. (2011). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/x63032819hx560m3/ Towards a Dynamic Balance between Humans and Automation: Authority, Ability, Responsibility and Control in Cooperative Control Situations]. ''Cognition, Technology and Work''. Advance online publication. doi: 10.1007/s10111-011-0191-6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children and the Three Authority Attributes ==
Authority and its attributes have been identified as of particular relevance to children as they regard their parents and teachers. The three attributes of authority have been described as ''status'', ''specialist skills'' or ''knowledge'', and ''social position''. Children consider the type of command, the characteristics of the authority figure, and the social context when making authority conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Laupa, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although children regard these three types of authority attributes, they firstly assess the legitimacy of the authority figure in question using the nature of the commands they give. For example, a teacher that does not appear to have legitimate power from the child’s perspective (perhaps because she or he cannot control the class well) will not be obeyed. Regarding parenting, authoritative parents who are warm and high in behavioural control but low in psychological control are more likely to be seen as having legitimate authority by the child, and will believe themselves that they have a duty to obey them and internalise their values.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, Cumsille &amp; Martínez, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

This law was enacted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] on November 7, 2016 and was implemented on June 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen/lfgz/flca/2015-07/06/content_1940614.htm|title=网络安全法（草案）全文_中国人大网|website=www.npc.gov.cn|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires network operators to store select data within China and allows Chinese authorities to conduct spot-checks on a company’s network operations.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Jack. “China's Cybersecurity Law: What You Need to Know.” The Diplomat, The Diplomat, 1 June 2017, thediplomat.com/2017/06/chinas-cybersecurity-law-what-you-need-to-know/.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ministry of Industry and Information Technology|The Chinese Ministry for Industry and Informatization]](中华人民共和国工业和信息化部) justified the law as the means of pursuing the [[Go_Out_policy|‘Going Out’ strategy]](走出去) they have persisted on ever since 1999. 

Cybersecurity is recognized as the “[[Basic Law]].” This puts the law on the top of the pyramid-structured legislation on cybersecurity.
The Law is an evolution of the previously existent cybersecurity rules and regulations from various levels and fields, assimilating them to create a structured law at the macro-level. The Law also offers principle norms on certain issues that are not immediately urgent, but are of definite long-term importance. These norms will serve as a legal reference when new issues arise.&lt;ref&gt;Lulu, Xia, and Zhao Leo. “China's Cybersecurity Law: An Introduction for Foreign Businesspeople.” China Briefing News, Grapevine Asia Partners, 21 Aug. 2018, www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-cybersecurity-law-an-introduction-for-foreign-businesspeople/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cybersecurity Law is applicable to network operators and businesses in “[[Critical_infrastructure|critical sectors]].”&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Jack. “China's Cybersecurity Law: What You Need to Know.” The Diplomat, The Diplomat, 1 June 2017, thediplomat.com/2017/06/chinas-cybersecurity-law-what-you-need-to-know/.&lt;/ref&gt; By critical sectors, China roughly divides the domestic businesses into Networking businesses that are involved in telecommunications, information services, energy transport, water, financial services, public services, and electronic government services.&lt;ref&gt;Hauke, Gierow Johannes. “Cyber Security in China: Internet Security, Protectionism and Competitiveness: New Challenges to Western Businesses.” China Monitor, Merics: Mercator Institute for China Studies, 22 Apr. 2015, www.merics.org/sites/default/files/2017-09/China_Monitor_22_Cybersecurity_EN.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

These definitions mean the law is applicable to almost all businesses in China that manage their own email or other data networks. Network operators are expected, amongst other things, to: clarify cybersecurity responsibilities within their organization, take technical measures to safeguard network operations and prevent data leaks and theft; and report any cybersecurity incidents to both users of the network and the relevant implementing department for that sector.&lt;ref&gt;Understanding China’s Cybersecurity Law INFORMATION FOR NEW ZEALAND BUSINESSES. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, Sept. 2017, www.mfat.govt.nz/assets/China/Understanding-Chinas-cybersecurity-law.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law is composed of supportive subdivisions of regulations that specify the purpose of it. For instance, the CII Security Protection Regulations and Measures for Security Assessment of Cross-border Transfer of Personal Information and Important Data. However, the law is yet to be called fixed, since China’s government authorities are occupied with defining more contingent laws to better correspond the Cyber Security Law. By incorporating preexisting laws on [[VPN]] and data security into the Cyber Security Law, the Chinese government is reinforcing business law in China  &lt;ref&gt;Beckett, Nick. “A Guide for Businesses to China's First Cyber Security Law.” ComputerWeekly.com, Nov. 2017, www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Chinas-first-cyber-security-law-what-it-means-for-companies.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cybersecurity Law also provides elaborate regulations and definitions on [[legal liability]]. For different types of illegal conduct, the Law sets a variety of punishments, such as fines, suspension for rectification, revocation of permits and business licenses, and others. The Law accordingly grant cybersecurity and administration authorities with rights and guidelines to carry out law enforcement on illegal acts.

Although the censorship affects the whole nation, it does not affect China's special administrative regions such as Hong Kong and Macau. This is because these regions enjoy a high degree of autonomy, as specified in local laws and the "[[One country, two systems]]" principle.

== Controversies ==

Along with the [[Great Firewall]], restrictions raises concerning voices, especially amongst foreign companies. Regarding the requirements for spot-checks and certifications, international law firms have warned that companies could be asked to provide source code, encryption, or other crucial information for review by the authorities, increasing the risk of this information being lost, passed on to local competitors, or used by the authorities themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Jack. “China's Cybersecurity Law: What You Need to Know.” The Diplomat, The Diplomat, 1 June 2017, thediplomat.com/2017/06/chinas-cybersecurity-law-what-you-need-to-know/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law sparked complaints both internally and internationally due to its wording. Foreign companies and businesses in China expressed concerns that this law might impede future [[investment]]s in China, because the law now requires them to "store their data on Chinese-law regulated local servers, and cooperate with Chinese national security agencies if asked to,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-40111643|title=中国施行《网络安全法》 外企为何担忧？|date=2017-05-31|work=BBC 中文网|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could potentially compromise business secrets and sensitive information. 

To comply with the law, for instance, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] announced that it would transfer the operation of [[iCloud]] in [[Mainland China]] to a government-sponsored [[data]] company named Guizhou-Cloud Big Data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208351|title=Learn more about iCloud in China|work=Apple Support|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, online services, including [[Skype]] and [[WhatsApp]], refused to store their data locally and were either banned from operating in China or restrained from further expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cn.nytimes.com/business/20171122/skype-app-china/|title=多家中国区应用商店下架Skype|date=2017-11-22|work=纽约时报中文网|access-date=2018-04-14|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 9 of the cybersecurity law states that “network operators … must obey social norms and commercial ethics, be honest and credible, perform obligations to protect network security, accept supervision from the government and public, and bear social responsibility.” Such vague provision is suspected to increase the government’s gourds to interpret and assert the need to intervene. Such interventions would include investigations which could disperse into government trade associations requesting spot-checks at the foreign firm. 

Foreign firms are now placed between two choices: One, they could invest in new data servers in China to comply with data localization or incur new costs to hire a local server provider, such as Huawei, Tencent, or Alibaba, which have spent billions in recent years establishing domestic data centers as part of Beijing’s [[Five-year_plans_of_China#Twelfth_Plan_(2011%E2%80%932015)|12th Five-Year Plan]] (2011-2015). The substantial investment by these Chinese technology firms in recent years is one of the reasons critics of the new law believe it is partly designed to bolster the domestic Chinese data management and telecommunications industry against global competitors.

However, an international firm in China reported to PGI that the intention of the law is not to prohibit foreign businesses from operating in China, nor is it to boost Chinese competitiveness. In fact, with regards to a study by Matthias Bauer and Hosuk Lee-Makiyama in 2015, data localization causes minor damage to economic growth due to inefficiencies that arise from data transfer processes and the duplication of data between several jurisdictions. As a matter of fact, the requirement for data localization should instead be seen as a legal move by Beijing — bringing data under Chinese jurisdiction will make it easier to prosecute entities seen as violating China’s internet laws.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Jack. “China's Cybersecurity Law: What You Need to Know.” The Diplomat, The Diplomat, 1 June 2017, thediplomat.com/2017/06/chinas-cybersecurity-law-what-you-need-to-know/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of AmCham South China, Harley Seyedin claimed that foreign firms are facing mass concerns because it has greatly increased operating costs and has had a big impact on how business is done in China. More specifically, he stated that cyber security law continues to create “uncertainties within the investment community and it’s resulting in, at the minimum, postponement of some R&amp;D investment.”&lt;ref&gt;Huifeng, Hu. “Cybersecurity law causing ‘mass concerns’ among foreign firms in China.” South China Post, March 1st, 2018, https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2135338/cybersecurity-law-causing-mass-concerns-among-foreign-firms-china.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was widely criticized by social activists for limiting [[free expression]]. For example, the law explicitly requires most online services operating in China to collect and verify the identity of their users, and, when required to, surrender such information to [[law enforcement]]. Activists claimed that that this policy dissuades people from freely expressing their thoughts online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/china/2015/07/150709_china_cyber_security_law|title=中国《网络安全法》草案出炉 恐加强言论管制|website=BBC 中文网|language=zh-Hans|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clean Tech Law''' contemplates a diverse set of legal and policy issues related to the development and commercialization of [[clean technology]]. These issues range from conventional [[natural resources]] law to cutting-edge [[intellectual property]] issues related to [[synthetic genomics]] and advanced materials.  Clean tech law could also address issues and conflicts surrounding the placement of such technologies (e.g., glare from solar panels).

==History==
The term clean tech, or cleantech, is short for [[clean technology]]. The abbreviated use of the term first appeared on October 10, 1990 in the [[Xinhua General News Service]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110315064606/http://cleantechlawandbusiness.com/cleanbeta/index.php/60/the-etymology-of-cleantech/ CleanBeta, What is CleanTech?]&lt;/ref&gt; Now, clean tech, is generally considered to include multiple advanced technologies in four economic sectors: [[energy]], [[water]], [[Raw material|material]]s, and [[transportation]]. These technologies break down in the following categories:

* Energy Generation
* Energy Storage
* Energy Infrastructure
* Energy Efficiency
* Transportation
* Water &amp; Wastewater
* Air &amp; Environment
* Materials

==Basic issues==
As a discrete legal field, clean tech law is in its infancy and so vaguely defined that it focuses as much on more familiar areas like liability and ownership as it does [[business models]] and corporate strategies. The transactional side of clean tech law revolved around development and commercializing of new technologies in [[renewable energy]], [[pollution]], and other frontiers in the fight against [[climate change]] and protection of natural resources, and the creation of green jobs. In addition, the basic economics are inseparable from substantive social and ethical issues posed by these emerging technologies. The more traditional legal areas of [[clean technology]] law include [[intellectual property]], [[patent law]], licensing, [[litigation]], and federal and state [[legislative]], [[landuse]] and regulatory issues.

{{Politics of Philippines}}
The '''Commission on Elections''' ({{lang-fil|Komisyon sa Halalan}}), usually abbreviated as '''{{Sc1|COMELEC}}''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comelec.gov.ph/ home page of the {{Sc2|COMELEC}} website] accessed 28 January 2016 consistently uses the all upper case abbreviation of "COMELEC" rather than "Comelec"&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the three [[constitutional commissions]] of the [[Philippines]]. Its principal role is to enforce all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of [[elections in the Philippines]].

==Functions==
According to Article IX-C, Section 2 of the [[1987 Constitution of the Philippines]], the Commission on Elections shall exercise the following powers and functions:&lt;ref&gt;Article IX-C, Section 2, 1987 Constitution of the Philippines&lt;/ref&gt;
# Enforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election, plebiscite, initiative, referendum, and recall.
# Exercise exclusive original jurisdiction over all contests relating to the elections, returns, and qualifications of all elective regional, provincial, and city officials, and appellate jurisdiction over all contests involving elective municipal officials decided by trial courts of general jurisdiction, or involving elective barangay officials decided by trial courts of limited jurisdiction. Decisions, final orders, or rulings of the Commission on election contests involving elective municipal and barangay offices shall be final, executory, and not appealable.
# Decide, except those involving the right to vote, all questions affecting elections, including determination of the number and location of polling places, appointment of election officials and inspectors, and registration of voters.
# Deputize, with the concurrence of the President, law enforcement agencies and instrumentalities of the Government, including the Armed Forces of the Philippines, for the exclusive purpose of ensuring free, orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections.
# Register, after sufficient publication, political parties, organizations, or coalitions which, in addition to other requirements, must present their platform or program of government; and accredit citizens’ arms of the Commission on Elections. Religious denominations and sects shall not be registered. Those which seek to achieve their goals through violence or unlawful means, or refuse to uphold and adhere to this Constitution, or which are supported by any foreign government shall likewise be refused registration. Financial contributions from foreign governments and their agencies to political parties, organizations, coalitions, or candidates related to elections constitute interference in national affairs, and, when accepted, shall be an additional ground for the cancellation of their registration with the Commission, in addition to other penalties that may be prescribed by law.
# File, upon a verified complaint, or on its own initiative, petitions in court for inclusion or exclusion of voters; investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute cases of violations of election laws, including acts or omissions constituting election frauds, offenses, and malpractices.
# Recommend to the Congress effective measures to minimize election spending, including limitation of places where propaganda materials shall be posted, and to prevent and penalize all forms of election frauds, offenses, malpractices, and nuisance candidacies.
# Recommend to the President the removal of any officer or employee it has deputized, or the imposition of any other disciplinary action, for violation or disregard of, or disobedience to its directive, order, or decision.
# Submit to the President and the Congress a comprehensive report on the conduct of each election, plebiscite, initiative, referendum, or recall.

==History==

===Predecessor===
====The Executive Bureau====
The Commission on Elections ({{Sc1|COMELEC}}) was created by a 1940 amendment to the 1935 [[Constitution of the Philippines]]. Before the creation of the {{Sc1|COMELEC}}, supervision over the conduct of elections was vested by law in the Executive Bureau under the Department of Interior and, later directly by the same Department. The Secretary of Interior saw to it that local authorities performed the ministerial duties assigned to them by the Election Code. He decides administrative questions concerning elections. The courts, however, exercised exclusive and final jurisdiction over questions affecting the right to vote as well as contested elections of local elective officials. Elections contests involving members of the [[National Assembly of the Philippines|National Assembly]] were judged solely by an Electoral Commission composed of three justices of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] and six members of the National Assembly.

===Statutory commission===
In view, however, of the close official ties between the [[President of the Philippines|President]] and the Secretary of Interior, there was always the danger of a partisan Secretary of the Interior exploiting his powers and influence to ensure the victory of his party at the polls. As a consequence, the Constitution was amended in 1940 to create an independent Commission on Elections, composed of a Chairman and two other members, to take over the functions of the Secretary of the Interior relative to the elections. but since the amendments could not be effective in time for the 1940 elections, the National Assembly, by Commonwealth Act No. 607, created a Commission on Elections, giving thereto the same powers which the Commission on Elections could have under the amended Constitution. The statutory Commission supervised the conduct of the December 10, 1940 local elections.

===Creation===
The constitutional amendment creating the Commission on Elections was finally approved on December 2, 1940. On June 21, 1941, Commonwealth Act No. 657 was enacted reorganizing the Commission on Elections as a constitutional entity. The members of the statutory Commission continued as members of the constitutional Commission.

The Chairman and Members of the Commission had a fixed term of nine years each – a member being replaced every three years except in the first Commission. They could be removed from office only by [[impeachment]]. They were provided with fixed salaries which could neither be increased nor diminished during their term of office. These were safeguards to ensure the independence of the Commission.

The administrative control of elections exercised by the Secretary of Interior was transferred to the Commission on Elections. The Commission was vested with the exclusive charge of enforcing and administering all laws relative to elections and power to decide all questions affecting elections, except those involving the right to vote, which were left to final judicial determination. The courts and electoral tribunals retained their original powers over election contests.

===Membership expansion===
The 1973 Constitution enlarged the membership of the Commission from three to nine members but reduced their term of office from nine years to seven years. As in the 1935 Constitution, the Chairman and Commissioners have staggered terms of office and could be removed from office only by impeachment.

First to serve in the Commission on Elections under the 1973 Constitution were former Senator Leonardo B. Perez, as Chairman, and Venacio S. Duque, Flores A. Bayot, Jose M. Mendoza, Fernando R. Veloso, Lininding Pangandaman, Venancio L. Yaneza and Casimiro R. Madarang, Jr. as Commissioners. Commissioner Pangandaman, the first Muslim Commissioner of the {{Sc1|COMELEC}}, was appointed Ambassador by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] even before the expiration of his term. His unexpired term was taken over by Commissioner Hashim R. Abubakar.

On May 17, 1980, Chairman Perez (who was later appointed Minister on Political Affairs by President Marcos) and Commissioners Duque and Bayot, after completing their seven-years term, retired. Commissioner Santiago succeeded Perez, and the following were appointed Commissioners: Domingo C. Pabalete; Victorino A. Savellano; Jaime C. Opinion; Noli Sagadraca; Romeo Firme: Luis Lardizabal and Ide C. Tillah. With Commissioner Lardizabal the membership of the Commission was thus increased to eight, one short of the full complement of nine.

Upon the retirement of Commissioners Firme, Tillah and Lardizabal on May 17, 1983 the Commission on Elections was composed of only five members. On March 21, 1983, two new members were appointed by President Marcos, namely: Froilan Bacungan and Ramon H. Felipe, Jr. With the retirement of Chairman Santiago and Commissioners Pabalete and Sagadraca on May 17, 1984, Savellano was appointed Chairman. Three new members were appointed on July 27, 1985, namely: Commissioners Quirino A. Marquinez, Mangontawar Guro and Mario D. Ortiz. On January 31, 1986 Commissioners Ruben C. Agpalo and Jaime Layosa were appointed to finally complete the required membership of nine.

===After the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution===
After the tumultuous February 7, 1986 [[Philippine presidential election, 1986|snap elections]] and the [[People Power Revolution]], Chairman Savellano and all the Commissioners of the {{Sc1|COMELEC}} tendered their courtesy resignations which, except those of Commissioners Bacungan and Felipe, were accepted by President [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon C. Aquino]].

On April 11, 1986 Commissioner Felipe was appointed Acting Chairman. On July 23, 1986 he took his oath of office as permanent Chairman, together with Commissioners Leopoldo Africa, [[Haydee Yorac]], Andres Flores, Anacleto Badoy, and Dario Rama as members of the "new" Commission on Elections. On February 15, 1988 [[Hilario G. Davide, Jr.]], was appointed Chairman with Alfredo E. Abueg, Jr., Haydee B. Yorac, Leopoldo L. Africa, Andres R. Flores, Dario C. Rama and Magdara B. Dimaampao as Commissioners. Commissioner Haydee B. Yorac was appointed as Acting Chairman when Hilario G. Davide, Jr. was appointed Chairman of the Presidential Fact Finding Commission in December 1989, pursuant to Administrative Order No. 146. On June 6, 1991 Christian Monsod was appointed by President Aquino as Chairman of the Commission to serve the unexpired term of Davide.

When Monsod retired on February 15, 1995 President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] appointed Court of Appeals Justice [[Bernardo P. Pardo|Bernardo Pardo]] as Chairman of the Commission. Pardo's term was cut short when he was appointed by President [[Joseph Estrada]] as Associate Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] in October 1998. Commissioner [[Luzviminda Tancangco]] was appointed Acting Chairman of the Commission.

On January 11, 1999 President Estrada appointed [[Sandiganbayan]] Justice [[Harriet Demetriou]] as Chairman of the Commission. After the events of January 2001 that led to the ouster of President Estrada from power, Demetriou tendered her courtesy resignation which was accepted by President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]].

On February 19, 2001 President Arroyo appointed Justice [[Alfredo Benipayo]] as Chairman of the Commission. However, the Commission on Appointments did not confirm his appointment due to opposition of some Commissioners led by Luzviminda Tancangco. On June 5, 2002 President Arroyo appointed [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] Chairman and former [[Mandaluyong City]] mayor [[Benjamin Abalos|Benjamin S. Abalos, Sr.]] to replace Benipayo. On January 26, 2008, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] appointed former Supreme Court Associate Justice Jose Melo, 77, to replace Chair Abalos.&lt;ref&gt;Marichu Villanueva [http://asianjournalusa.com/melo-named-new-comelec-chairman-p3958-67.htm Melo named new {{Sc1|COMELEC}} chairman] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428184916/http://asianjournalusa.com/melo-named-new-comelec-chairman-p3958-67.htm |date=2012-04-28 }}. asianjournalusa.com (2008-01-26)&lt;/ref&gt; The United Opposition ([[Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino]]) opposed Melo's appointment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/video/17270/opposition-questions-melo-s-appointment-as-poll-chief Opposition questions Melo's appointment as poll chief]. gmanetwork.com.

Brawner was appointed [[ad interim]] Acting Chairman on February 2, 2008 and will stay as Chairman until Melo is confirmed by the CA. On March 25, 2008, former Supreme Court justice Jose Melo was sworn in as new chairman of the Commission on Elections ({{Sc1|COMELEC}}) by acting Chair [[Romeo A. Brawner]].

==Issues and incidents==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}

===ZTE broadband contract controversy===
In August 2007, Nueva Vizcaya Rep. Carlos Padilla delivered a privilege speech alleging that Abalos brokered for the national broadband network (NBN) project. Padilla claimed that Abalos met with officials of the Chinese firm ZTE Corp., which got the US $329 million contract for the broadband project.

Abalos denied brokering for the National Broadband Network project despite admitting he knows some officials in ZTE Corp. He admitted making four trips to China and playing golf there. He also admitted that ZTE officials, whom he says are his golf buddies, hosted and paid for the trips.

Jose de Venecia III, son of House Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr, alleged that Abalos offered him US$10 million to withdraw his proposal on the NBN project. De Venecia is a majority shareholder of Amsterdam Holdings Inc., a company that submitted an unsolicited proposal on the NBN project. De Venecia also claimed that Abalos asked for money from the ZTE Corp. officials.

===Hello Garci scandal===
{{main article|Hello Garci scandal}}
Abalos was mentioned in the "Hello Garci" tape, which refers to the alleged wiretapped conversations where vote rigging in the 2004 elections was discussed by, among others, a woman presumed to be President Arroyo and man presumed to be {{Sc1|COMELEC}} Commissioner Virgilio Garcillano.

===Mega Pacific===
Abalos was the {{Sc1|COMELEC}} chair when the election body approved a P1.3-billion contract with the Mega Pacific Consortium for the purchase of automated counting machines, which the Supreme Court in January 2004 declared as void because of "clear violation of law and jurisprudence" and "reckless disregard of {{Sc1|COMELEC}}'s own bidding rules and procedure."

On January 21, 2004, Pimentel filed criminal and administrative charges before the Ombudsman against Abalos and other commissioners in connection with the deal. Abalos described the charges as a "demolition job."

Pimentel accused Abalos and the other commissioners of committing an act of impropriety when they and their wives traveled to Seoul, South Korea to visit the plant of the maker of the counting machines a few months before the bidding for the contract started. Pimentel said he received information that the Korean company paid for the plane tickets and hotel accommodations for the trip.

However, Abalos claimed that the expenses for the trip were paid for out of the P1 million he won in a golf tournament in Wack Wack.

On September 27, 2006, the Ombudsman, in a resolution, absolved all respondents involved in the Mega Pacific controversy of all administrative and criminal liabilities "for lack of probable cause." It also reversed its June 28 resolution which contained factual findings that can be used by the House of Representatives to initiate impeachment proceedings against {{Sc1|COMELEC}} Commissioner Resureccion Borra.

Just six weeks before the [[Philippine general election, 2016|general day]] of 9 May 2016, the {{Sc1|COMELEC}} website was hacked by a group called "[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous Philippines]]" on the night of 27 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/127256-comelec-website-hacked-anonymous-philippines|title=Comelec website hacked a month before polls|work=[[Rappler]]|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymous Philippines asked the poll body to implement security on Precinct Count Optical Scanners (PCOS) — automated voting machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/776416/look-comelec-website-hacked|title=LOOK: Comelec website hacked|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group calling itself ''[[LulzSec]] Pilipinas'', claimed to have hacked {{Sc1|COMELEC}}'s website, and posted its database on their Facebook account shortly after ''Anonymous Philippines'' compromised {{Sc1|COMELEC}}'s website.&lt;ref name="lulz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/127315-comelec-data-hackers|title=Comelec data leaked by hackers|work=Rappler|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/03/28/Comelec-website-hack-Anonymous-Philippines.html|title=Anonymous PH hacks Comelec website|work=[[CNN Philippines]]|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exploits exposed voter data and the vulnerability of both voter registration data and the functionality of their website.&lt;ref name="lulz"/&gt; LulzSec posts 3 mirror links on their Facebook account that can be downloaded.&lt;ref name="lulz"/&gt; The incident was considered the biggest private leak data in the Philippine history and leaving millions of registered voters at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/127870-comelec-leak-identity-theft-scams-experts|title=Experts fear identity theft, scams due to Comelec leak|accessdate=21 April 2016|date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://interaksyon.com/article/126807/comeleaks--lawmakers-voter-database-breach-compromises-may-9-elections-pnp-joins-probe|title='COMELEAKS' Lawmakers: Voter database breach compromises May 9 elections; PNP joins probe|work=Interaksyon|accessdate=22 April 2016|date=22 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423132845/http://interaksyon.com/article/126807/comeleaks--lawmakers-voter-database-breach-compromises-may-9-elections-pnp-joins-probe|archivedate=23 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many entities have been called a '''Constitutional Commission''' with the general purpose of reviewing a [[constitution]], or planning to create one.

==Afghanistan==
*[[Afghan Constitution Commission]]
**[[Timeline of the War in Afghanistan (August 2003)]]
*[[Reigns of Nadir Shah and Zahir Shah]]

== Australia ==
{{further|Constitutional history of Australia}}

In 1985 a Constitutional Commission was established (by the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government) to review the Australian Constitution and reported in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Final Report of the Constitutional Commission 1988|location=Canberra|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was seen as too partisan by many [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]] and the eventual referendum questions were not supported; leading to the lowest 'yes' vote count for any referendum in [[Australia]] (in [[Australian referendum, 1988|1988]]).

== Canada ==
{{further|Constitutional history of Canada}}

The federally initiated [[Rowell–Sirois Commission]] of 1937 to 1940 recommended (successfully) that the federal government take over [[unemployment insurance]] and [[pensions]] from the provinces.

The Quebec-initiated [[Royal Commission of Inquiry on Constitutional Problems]] of 1953 to 1956 argued (unsuccessfully) for the devolution of more powers to the Province of Quebec.

The federal [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] recommended (successfully) that Canada become officially [[bilingual]] and [[bicultural]] (later modified to ''multi''cultural).

==Philippines==
On January 1942, the [[Philippine Executive Commission]] or PEC was established as the temporary care-taker government of the Greater Manila area and eventually of the whole Philippines during the Japanese occupation of the country during World War II. The constitution existed until the [[Liberation of Manila]] in 1945.

In 1986, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] dissolved the 1973 Constitution and called for its revision. From February 1986 to February 1987, the Philippines was run under a Provisionary Constitution called "Freedom Constitution" drafted by her executive secretary [[Joker Arroyo]]. On September 1986, the [[Constitutional Commission of 1986]] was set up with all members appointed by Aquino. The revised Philippine Constitution was placed into a [[Philippine constitutional plebiscite, 1987|plebiscite]] with 76% affirmative votes and was approved.

An unrelated concept is a "constitutional commission" (a commission created by the constitution) as stated in the 1987 Constitution are governmental bodies that are independent of the three main branches of government. These are the [[Civil Service Commission (Philippines)|Civil Service Commission]], [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit]], and the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]]. The 1987 Constitution does not place upon a constitutional commission the task of amending the constitution: these fall under the [[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|Constitutional Convention]], the [[Constituent Assembly (Philippines)|Constituent Assembly]] and the [[People's Initiative]].

==Scotland==
*[[Scottish Constitutional Commission]] - A non-partisan think-tank, not to be confused with the [[Commission on Scottish Devolution]] which performs a similar function to a conventional constitutional commission, with regard to devolved government in Scotland.

==Seychelles==
*[[Politics of Seychelles#Return to multiparty system|Seychelles Constitutional Commission]], established in 1992

==Tanzania==
*[[Tanzanian Constitutional Review Commission]]

==See also==
*[[Constitutional convention (political meeting)]]

'''Contract failure''' describes a situation in which the consumer of a good or service is unable to evaluate its quality, thus incentivizing the producer to produce a lower quality good or service.&lt;ref name="(W.)Steinberg2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walter Powell (W.)|author2=Richard Steinberg|title=The nonprofit sector: a research handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ligvL-cLFIEC&amp;pg=PA121|accessdate=29 April 2013|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10903-0|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such behavior creates suboptimal economic conditions.&lt;ref name="Benson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Benson|title=The Theory of Contract Law: New Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GSf6QGASEoC&amp;pg=PA54|accessdate=29 April 2013|date=5 February 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64038-1|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contract failure is one explanation for the existence of [[non-profit organization]]s,&lt;ref name="Anheier2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helmut K.

== Information Asymmetry ==
The known cause of contract failure is called [[information asymmetry]]; when one party (the producer) has more information than the other party (the consumer) about a product or service.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=D|title=Contract Failure. In The Nature of the Nonprofit Sector|date=1998|publisher=West View|location=Philadelphia|pages=154–157|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is information inequality between the two parties.&lt;ref name=Arrow&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrow|first1=J.K.|title=Uncertainty and the welfare economics of medical care.|journal=The American Economic Review|date=1963|pages=941–973}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Young, there are three causes in which situations dealing with asymmetric information arise from, to include the following, 1) the quality of a product or service is too complex to be judged such as medical care or higher education; 2) the end consumer of the product or service cannot evaluate it him or herself such as a child in daycare or an elderly individual in a nursing home; and 3) the product or service is not consumed by the individual who purchased it, therefore the purchaser would never know if the producer delivered what was promised.&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;

== Nonprofit Existence ==
When contract failure occurs, there is a suboptimal provision of public goods, which results in market failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weisbrod|first1=B.A.|title=Economics of Institutional Choice|journal=Working Paper|date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrow argues that nonprofits will step in and provide the necessary good or service in response to market failure.&lt;ref name="Arrow"/&gt; When markets potentially take advantage of the information asymmetry situation, nonprofits must protect the consumer.&lt;ref name=ihlan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ihlan|first1=H.|title=Nonprofit Organizations as Providers of Public Goods.|journal=Journal of Management &amp; Economics|date=2013|volume=20|issue=1|pages=95–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-Distribution Constraint ==
According to Hansmann, the “non-distribution constraint - prohibits the distribution of residual earnings to individuals who exercise control over the firm”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hansmann|first1=H.B.|title=The Role of Nonprofit Enterprise.|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=1980|volume=5|page=835}}&lt;/ref&gt; It prohibits those who have a vested interest in the organization from receiving the organization’s profit for personal gain. This constraint is a common characteristic of nonprofits, which creates less of an incentive for the organization to take advantage of the consumer’s lack of knowledge. The nonprofit has no reason to cheat the consumer out of quality or service delivery because the organization's individuals cannot benefit directly. Therefore, the consumer is more likely to trust a nonprofit organization providing services than to trust a for-profit organization because of the nonprofit’s non-distribution constraint.&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt; According to Easley and O'Hara, state law stipulates that the organizations day-to-day costs should be reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easley|first1=D.|last2=O'Hara|first2=M.|title=The Economic Role of the Nonprofit Firm|journal=The Bell Journal of Economics|date=1983|pages=531–538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1371">The term "'''copyright abolition movements'''" refers to movements to abolish [[copyright]], specifically those that espouse the repeal of the [[Statute of Anne]] and all subsequent law made in its support.

Michele Boldrin and David K. Levine, economists at Washington University, have suggested that copyrights and [[Patent|patents]] are a net loss for the economy because of the way they reduce [[competition]] in the [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/549822/?sc=dwhn newswise.com]&lt;/ref&gt; They refer to copyrights and patents as intellectual monopolies, akin to industrial monopolies, and they advocate phasing out and eventually abolishing them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual/againstfinal.htm dklevine.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6582">The '''Court of Historical Review''' (sometimes called the '''Court of Historical Review and Appeal''') is a mock [[court]] in San Francisco, California. It has been convened on irregular intervals over several decades in order to decide questions of historical curiosity. The court's judgment is purely symbolic and has no legal or academic authority. The court has been presided over by a number of actual or retired judges, including [[U.S. District Court]] Judge Daniel Hanlon and San Francisco Municipal Court Judge George T. Choppelas.

Though it is a mock court, a number of notable attorneys and civic figures have argued cases and appeared as "witnesses", sometimes in character as historical figures. The court's proceedings are described as colorful and are reported widely.

== Cases ==

The most widely noted case before the Court of Historical Review was in 1983, when it determined that the [[fortune cookie]] was invented in San Francisco, not Los Angeles. Participants in the case "wore yellow makeup and Celestial costumes and spoke in pidgin English as they presented the oral history underlying each side’s case".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2005/1/2005_1_9.shtml "Who Invented the Fortune Cookie?", ''American Heritage'', February/March 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lefty O'Doul]], was not named to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] before his death in December 1969, and is still waiting to be recognized, an ongoing issue important to many fans of the game. The 76th meeting of the Court of Historical Review in 1997 heard spirited arguments from the opposition justifying his exclusion, and others supporting his admittance.   In the end, Judge George T. Choppelas accepted criteria was sufficient for O'Doul's induction into the Hall of Fame.  The verdict was passionately greeted with boos and cheers by both sides of the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Hall-of-a-judgment-for-Lefty-O-Doul-3113646.php&lt;/ref&gt;

While many issues were of uncertain merit such as determining [[Elvis Presley]] was indeed dead; others had a much more serious tone, "retrying" controversial cases which already passed through actual courts of law.  [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]], though acquitted in 1921 over the 1919 [[Black Sox Scandal]], could no longer play ball professionally nor be admitted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]. Stories about his presumed guilt continued to be distributed.  In 1993, Jackson's innocence was affirmed by the Court of Historical Review.&lt;ref&gt;Ratajczak, M. D. Kenneth J.  "The Wrong Man Out"  p.84 Authorhouse Bloomington IN 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel]] leaders used the [[Aimee Semple McPherson]] ruling in 1990 as a modern vindication by law professionals who re-examined the evidence; agreeing with the earlier grand jury inquiries that there was nothing substantial disproving their founder's 1926 kidnapping story.&lt;ref&gt;"Los Angeles Times", October 09, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  The mock court did not come to any decisive ruling on whether or not  [[Bruno Hauptman]] was guilty of his charged crimes resulting in his execution, but recommended that the case be reopened.

[[File:Adrian Stokes - Hunters on the moor north of Skagen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|400px|right|upright|At [[common law]], property owners held title to all resources located above, below, or upon their land]]
'''''Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos''''' ([[Latin]] for "whoever's is the soil, it is theirs all the way to Heaven and all the way to Hell")&lt;ref&gt;''Jackson Mun. Airport Auth. v. Evans'', 191 So. 2d 126, 128 (Miss. 1966) (transcribing doctrine as "ad inferos"); Samantha J. Hepburn, ''Ownership Models for Geological Sequestration: A Comparison of the Emergent Regulatory Models in Australia &amp; the United States'', 44 {{smallcaps|Envtl. L. Rep. News &amp; Analysis}} 10310, 10313 (2014) (translating phrase as "whoever owns [the] soil, [it] is theirs all the way [up] to Heaven and [down] to Hell") (internal quotation marks omitted)&lt;/ref&gt; is a principle of [[property law]], stating that property holders have rights not only to the plot of land itself, but also to the air above and (in the broader formulation) the ground below. The principle is often referred to in its abbreviated form as the '''''ad coelum''''' doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''Hinman v. Pac. Air Lines Transp. Corp.'', 84 F.2d 755, 757 (9th Cir. 1936) (noting that "the ad coelum doctrine does not apply in California")&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern law, this principle is still accepted in limited form, and the rights are divided into [[air rights]] above and [[subsurface rights]] below. Property title includes to the space immediately above and below the ground – preventing overhanging parts of neighboring buildings – but do not have rights to control flights far above the ground or in space. In dense urban areas, air rights may be transferable (see [[transferable development rights]]) to allow construction of new buildings over existing buildings.

Early versions of the maxim have been traced to the 13th-century Italian jurist [[Accursius]], and is said to date in [[common law]] to the time of [[Edward I]]. It was more recently promulgated, in broad form (air above and ground below) by [[William Blackstone]] in his influential treatise ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1766).

== Applications ==
As the name describes, the principle is that a person who owns a particular piece of land owns everything above and below it as well. Consequently, the owner could prosecute [[trespass]] against people who violated the border but never actually touched the soil. As with any other property rights, the owner can sell or lease it to others, or it may be taken or regulated by the [[State (polity)|state]].

For example, suppose three people owned neighboring plots of land. The owners of the plots on the ends want to build a bridge over the center plot connecting their two properties. Even though the bridge would never touch the soil of the owner in the middle, the principle of ''cuius est solum'' would allow the middle owner to stop its construction or demand payment for the right to do so. By the same principle, a person who wants to [[Mining|mine]] under somebody's land would have to get permission from the owner to do so, even if the mine entrance was on neighboring land.

==Origins==
The phrase is credited to the [[glossator]] [[Accursius]]&lt;!-- father, not son--&gt; in the 13th Century.&lt;ref name="beale"&gt;Harvard Legal Essays, Written in Honor of and Presented to John Henry Beale and Samuel Williston, 1977, Ayer Company Publishers, Incorporated, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YXVALg0GntsC&amp;pg=PA522&amp;dq=Accursius p. 522], note 8: "He who owns the soil owns it up to the sky." The maxim had no place in the Roman law during its classical period, but is said to have been first used by Accursius of Bologna, a commentator, who flourished in the thirteenth century. It has been suggested that the maxim was introduced into England by the son of Accursius whom Edward I brought with him on his return from the Holy Land and who for many years held high office under the Crown and also was connected with Oxford University. Bouvé, Private Ownership of Airspace, 1 Air Law Rev. 232, 246–248. At any rate, nearly three centuries later the reporter's note to Bury ''v.'' Pope, Cro. Eliz. 118 [78 Eng.

The principle was firmly established in common law by [[Edward Coke]] in ''Bury ''v.'' Pope'' (1587),&lt;ref name="bury"&gt;Bury ''v.'' Pope, Cro. Eliz. 118 [78 Eng.

{{quotation|And lastly, the earth hath in law a great extent upwards, not only of water as hath been said, but of aire, and all other things even up to heaven, for ''cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum,'' as it is holden.}}
The [[Reporter (law)|reporter's note]] to this case&lt;ref name="bury" /&gt; ascribes the maxim to the time of Edward I, which accords with the attribution to Accursius (father and son).&lt;ref name="beale" /&gt; Two other cases around 1600 also use the principle, and a number of 19th century cases also apply it.&lt;ref name="swetland" /&gt;

The phrase appears in [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk2ch2.asp Blackstone's Commentaries, Book 2, Chapter 2], p.&amp;nbsp;*18:
{{quotation|Land hath also, in its legal signification, an indefinite extent, upwards as well as downwards. ''Cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum,'' is the maxim of the law, upwards; therefore no man may erect any building, or the like, to overhang another's land: and, downwards, whatever is in a direct line between the surface of any land, and the center of the earth, belongs to the owner of the surface; as is every day's experience in the mining countries. So that the word "land" includes not only the face of the earth, but every thing under it, or over it. And therefore if a man grants all his lands, he grants thereby all his mines of metal and other fossils, his woods, his waters, and his houses, as well as his fields and meadows.}}
This formulation, though it omits the ''et ad inferos'' "and to hell" wording, includes that interpretation ("and the center of the earth"). Largely through the influence of Blackstone, this broader formulation became influential in [[Law of the United States|American law]].&lt;ref&gt;John G. Sprankling, ''Owning the Center of the Earth'', 55 UCLA L. Rev. 979, 982-83 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; See Sweeney reference for various formulations of the principle in Anglo-American law.&lt;ref&gt;Edward C. Sweeney, "Adjusting the Conflicting Interests of Landowner and Aviator in Anglo-American Law," 3 Journal of Air Law and Commerce (1932), 355–373. (Cited in Schick, footnote 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle does not occur in classical [[Roman law]].&lt;ref name="beale" /&gt; The phrase was used by Accursius in discussion of rights to have burial plots or tombs free from the interference of an overhanging building.&lt;ref name="swetland" /&gt; In Coke's formulation, he cites three cases involving birds; the circa 1600 cases involve overhanging roofs, while the 19th century cases address diverse topics.&lt;ref name="swetland" /&gt; The principle attracted increased interest with the development of air and space travel occasioning much discussion, particularly in the 1930s,&lt;!-- See all the air law references from the 1930s; the Air law journals were established 1930 --&gt; and the development of space travel yielding further review of the ad coelum doctrine in the 1960s.

In American law, the formulation ''Ab orco usque ad coelum'' "from Hades all the way to Heaven"&lt;ref&gt;''ab'' and ''ad'' mean "from" and "to", and are common Latin words; ''orco,'' from the Italian underworld god [[Orcus]], refers poetically to the underworld, ''[[wikt:coelum|coelum]]'' means "sky, heaven", and  ''[[wikt:usque|usque]]'' means "continuously, without break"&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Louis Brandeis]] is also found.

==Modern history==
The steadfast ''ad coelum'' doctrine of property began to fall into disfavor with the advent of air and space travel:&lt;ref name=Mises&gt;Huebert, Jacob H. (2011-04-18) [http://mises.org/daily/5205/Who-Owns-the-Sky Who Owns the Sky?], [[Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
After the first hot-air balloon flight in 1783, people began to realize that strict ''ad coelum'' would undermine all air travel. Jurists occasionally invoked aerial-balloon trespass as an example of a trivial injury for which the law would not provide redress, even if the balloonists' drift with air currents were technically illegal under the ''ad coelum doctrine'', apparently most landowners agree that balloons drifting along with air currents unworthy of legal action.

However, the rights of landowners to the airspace immediately over their land were affirmed in England and Wales in ''Kelsen v. Imperial Tobacco Co.''&lt;ref&gt;[1957] 2 QB 334&lt;/ref&gt; where a sign erected on a building that overhung the plaintiff's property committed the [[tort]] of trespass, even though no harm or nuisance was caused by it.  An injunction was granted to the landowner requiring the sign to be removed. The right of landowners to prevent the 'overflying' without their permission of the large crane jibs used in construction has also been affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;''Anchor Brewhouse Developments Ltd v Berkeley House (Dockland Developments) Ltd'' [1987] 2 EGLR 173&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Lord Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews &amp; General Ltd]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[1978] QB 479&lt;/ref&gt; the Court noted that the ''ad coelum'' phrase was 'colourful', but said that it was well settled in the common law that a land owner had rights in the air immediately above the land, extending in particular to signs overhanging from adjacent properties.  The right did not extend though to more than was 'necessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment of the land and structures upon it'.  

In ''Star Energy Weald Basin Limited and another v Bocardo SA'' &lt;ref&gt;[2010] UKSC 35&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]] (having heard argument that the principle was no longer relevant to land ownership) held that the principle "... still has value in English law as encapsulating, in simple language, a proposition of law which has commanded general acceptance.  It is an imperfect guide, as it has ceased to apply to the use of airspace above a height which may interfere with the ordinary user of land [''cf Bernstein, above'']..." The Supreme Court nevertheless upheld the claimant's right to claim for trespass at depths of 250 - 400 metres below the surface, whilst acknowledging that subterranean ownership could not extend indefinitely. The decision has subsequently been restricted by section 43 of the [[Infrastructure Act 2015]], which permits the exploitation of 'deep level land' (defined as land more than 300 metres below the surface) for certain purposes without liability for trespass. This was passed to facilitate 'fracking', and would have permitted some (though not all) of the intrusions in the ''Bocardo'' case.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within the United States, the end indefinitely upward interpretation of the ''ad coelum'' doctrine came from a well-reasoned  [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[United States v. Causby]]'' in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Causby]]'', {{ussc|328|256|1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Causby'' case:&lt;ref name=Mises/&gt;
  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Causby case rejected the notion that property ownership extended upward 'indefinitely', while still recognizing a landowner retains complete domain over the lower altitudes above their property.  The court noted that ad coelum "had no meaning in the modern world" ,while also holding that "if the landowner is to have full enjoyment of the land, he must have exclusive control of the immediate reaches of the enveloping atmosphere. Otherwise buildings could not be erected, trees could not be planted, and even fences could not be run" ..."The fact that he does not occupy [the space] in a physical sense -- by the erection of buildings and the like -- is not material.  As we have said, the flight of airplanes, which skim the surface but do not touch it, is as much an appropriation of the use of the land as a more conventional entry upon it.” id 264 .  On remand, the Court of Claims established the landowner's property only extends upward to 365 feet, but not above. see Causby v U.S. court of claims (1948). 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the advent of [[space exploration]], the upper limits to the "ad coelum" doctrine now include issues of national sovereignty. Strong arguments can be made for and against the altitude at which national sovereignty ceases and the rights of orbit or travel starts. In particular, the making of [[Sovereign state|national]] [[Land claim|territorial claims]] in [[outer space]] and on [[celestial body|celestial bodies]] has been specifically proscribed by the [[1967 Outer Space Treaty]], which was, {{asof|2012|lc=y}}, ultimately ratified by all space-faring nations.&lt;ref name=tna2012fall&gt; {{cite journal |last=Simberg |first=Rand |title=Property Rights in Space |journal=The New Atlantis |date=Fall 2012 |issue=37 |pages=20–31 |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/property-rights-in-space |accessdate=2012-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215001750/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/property-rights-in-space |archivedate=2012-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Article II of the treaty notes that "Outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation."  The "''ad coelum''" doctrine-that property or sovereignty extends indefinable upward-is no longer accepted without limitations. This is not surprising since any claim to space based on national boundaries is based upon points defined on the surface of a rotating planet and therefore must have an upper boundary.

The "''ad infernum''" theory positing property ownership "to the center of the Earth" has also been eroded. A review of modern American jurisprudence demonstrates that the theory is more poetic hyperbole than binding law, and that broadly speaking, the deeper the disputed region, the less likely courts are to recognize that the surface owner holds subsurface title. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sprankling|first=John G.|year=2008|title=Owning the Center of the Earth|url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/55-4-4.pdf|journal=UCLA Law Review|volume=55|pages=979-1040|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appraisal studies of subsurface projects such as subways, deep storm drainage tunnels, and particle colliders consistently conclude that such projects, built well below the area that the vast majority of surface property owners ever put to use, do not deprive the surface owners of any value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Derbes|first=Max J.

People characterizing themselves as digital citizens often use IT extensively, creating [[blogs]], using [[social networks]], and participating in [[Digital journalism|online journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/4678631.stm|title=Have Your Say - Are you a digital citizen?|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although digital citizenship potentially begins when any child, teen, and/or adult signs up for an email address, posts pictures online, uses [[e-commerce]] to buy merchandise online, and/or participates in ''any'' electronic function that is [[B2C]] or [[Business-to-business|B2B]], the process of becoming a digital citizen goes beyond simple Internet activity. In the framework of T.H. Marshall's perspective on citizenship's three traditions (liberalism, republicanism, and ascriptive hierarchy), digital citizenry can occur alongside the promotion of equal economic opportunity, as well as increased political participation and civic duty.&lt;ref&gt;8.

London: Pluto Perspectives.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital technology can lower the [[barriers to entry]] for participation as a citizen within society.

Highly developed states possess the capacity to link their respective governments with digital sites. Such sites function in ways such as illuminating recent legislation, educating current and future policy objectives, lending agency toward political candidates, and/or allowing citizens to voice themselves in a political way. Likewise, the generation of these sites has been linked to increased voting advocacy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Lack of access toward becoming a digital citizen can be a serious drawback, since many elementary procedures such as tax report filing, birth registration, and use of Web sites to support candidates in political campaigns ([[E-democracy]]) etc. have been transferred to only be available via the [[Internet]]. Furthermore, many cultural and commercial entities only publicize information on [[web pages]]. Non-digital citizens will not be able to retrieve this information and this may lead to social isolation or economic stagnation. The gap between digital citizens and non-digital citizens is often referred to as the [[digital divide]]. Currently, the digital divide is a subject of academic debate as access to the Internet has increased, but the place in which the Internet is accessed (work, home, public library, etc.) has a significant effect on how such access will be utilized, if even in a manner related to citizenry. Recent scholarship has correlated the desire to be technologically proficient with greater belief in computer access equity, and thus, digital citizenship (Shelley, et al.).

In [[developing countries]] digital citizens are more sparse. They consist of the people in such countries who utilize technology to overcome their localized obstacles including development issues, corruption, and even military conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/gear/2005-08-28-cell-banks-africa_x.htm|title=Africa's cell phone boom creates a base for low-cost banking|work=usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such citizens include users of [[Ushahidi]] during the [[2007–08 Kenyan crisis|2007 disputed Kenyan election]], and protesters in the [[Arab Spring]] movements who used media to document repression of protests.

==Participation==
The development of digital citizen participation can be divided into two main stages: information dissemination and citizen [[deliberation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080710184539/http://www.businessofgovernment.org/pdfs/HolzerReport.pdf Restoring Trust in Government: The Potential of Digital Citizen Participation]&lt;/ref&gt; Digital citizenship, or the ability to participate in society online, promotes social inclusion. Digital Citizenship examines three aspects of participation in society online: economic opportunity, democratic participation and inclusion in prevailing forms of communication.

==Engagement of youth==

A recent survey revealed that teenagers and young adults spend more time on the Internet than watching TV.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.forbes.com/technology/newswire/2003/07/24/rtr1037488.html Youth Spend More Time on Web than TV:Study]", ''Reuters'', 24 July 2003, Retrieved 4 Dec. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This has raised a number of concerns about how Internet use could impact cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mills |first1=Kathryn |title=Possible Effects of Internet Use on Cognitive Development in Adolescence |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=3 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i3.516 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/516}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by Wartella et al., the first of its kind, teens are concerned about how digital technologies may have an impact on their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wartella |first1=Ellen |last2=Rideout |first2=Vicky |last3=Montague |first3=Heather |last4=Beaudoin-Ryan |first4=Leanne |last5=Lauricella |first5=Alexis |title=Teens, Health and Technology: A National Survey |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=3 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i3.515 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/515}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Digital youth can be generally viewed as the test market for the next generation's digital content and services. Sites such as [[Myspace]] and [[Facebook]] have come to the fore in sites where youth participate and engage with others on the Internet. However, due to the lack of popularity with MySpace in particular, more young people are turning to websites such as SnapChat, Instagram, and YouTube. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/03/health/teens-tweens-media-screen-use-report/|title=Teens spend 9 hours a day using media, report says  - CNN|last=CNN|first=Kelly Wallace,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in 2015, it was reported that teenagers spend up to 9 hours a day on the internet, with the vast majority of that time being spent on social media websites from mobile devices, contributing to the ease of access and availability to young people. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.socialmediatoday.com/marketing/how-much-time-do-people-spend-social-media-infographic|title=How Much Time Do People Spend on Social Media? [Infographic]|work=Social Media Today|access-date=2018-02-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;Vast amounts of money are spent annually to research the demographic by hiring psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists in order to discover habits, values and fields of interest&lt;ref&gt;[http://dspace.wrlc.org/bitstream/1961/4649/1/youthreport.pdf Youth as E-Citizens: Engaging the Digital Generation]&lt;/ref&gt;
Particularly in the United States, "Social media use has become so pervasive in the lives of American teens that having a presence on a social network is almost synonymous with being online; 95% of all teens ages 12-17 are now online and 80% of those online teens are users of social media sites".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.pewinternet.org/2011/11/09/teens-kindness-and-cruelty-on-social-network-sites/ How American Teens Navigate the New World of 'digital Citizenship']". Pew Research Center's Internet &amp; American Life Project. Web. 23 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, movements such as these appear to benefit strictly those wishing to advocate for their business towards youth. The critical time when young people are developing their civic identities is between the ages 15–22. During this time they develop three attributes: civic literacy, civic skills and civic attachment that comprise [[civic engagement]] later reflected in political actions of their adult lives.&lt;ref&gt;Delli Carpini, The Youth Engagement Initiative Strategy Paper, 10
Educational leaders today are preparing the educational system "American education from pre-K to 12 and beyond to better prepare students to thrive in the global economy." Today's youth needs to be exposed and  prepared for the world they will be living in.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1568480,00.html|title=How to Bring Our Schools Out of the 20th Century|date=10 December 2006|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An open Internet as delegated by a state's government is necessary to instill a sense of trust, legitimacy, and participation in the state's citizenry. [[WikiLeaks]] represents an occurrence where particular political actors have criticized and taken citizen action toward revealing the government's unnecessary clandestine activity online. "The benefit of transparency isn't just catching red-handed bastards. It's also about collaborating and coming together with a more engaged citizenry."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ottawacitizen.com/health/Internet+pushing+governments+more+open+digital+expert+says/5736026/story.html &lt;!-- |accessdate=November 24, 2011  --&gt;]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Internet is a reading-intensive medium that may challenge full access and participation to youth. For youth to fully participate and realize their presence on the Internet, a quality level of reading comprehension is required. "The average government Web site, for examples, requires an eleventh-grade level of reading comprehension, even though about half of the U.S. population reads at an eighth-grade level or lower".&lt;ref&gt;7. Mossberger, Karen. "Digital Citizenship - The Internet, Society and Participation" By Karen Mossberger, Caroline J. Tolbert, and Ramona S. McNeal." 23 Nov. 2011. {{ISBN|978-0819456069}}&lt;/ref&gt; So despite the Internet being a place irrespective of certain factors such as race, religion, and class, education plays a large part in a person's capacity to present themselves online in a formal manner conducive towards their citizenry. Concurrently, education also affects people's motivation to participate online.

Students in school should be encouraged to utilize technology with responsibility and Ethical Digital Citizenship strongly promoted. Education on harmful viruses, Trojans, and worms must be emphasized to protect resources. A student can be a successful Digital Citizen with the help of educators, parents, and school counselors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationworld.com/a_tech/responsible-student-technology-use.shtml|title=Help Kids Become Responsible Digital Citizens|publisher=educationworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits on the use of data==
International [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Guidelines state that "personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are to be used, and to the extent necessary for those purposes should be accurate, complete, and kept up to date". Also Article 8 prevents subjects to certain exceptions. Meaning that certain things cannot be published online revealing race, ethnicity, religion, political stance, health, and sex life. This is enforced generally by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC)- but very generally. For example, the FTC did bring an action against Microsoft for preventing to properly protect their customers' personal information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/dsolove/Digital-Person/text/Digital-Person-CH1.pdf The Digital Person - Technology and Privacy in the Information Age - Chapter 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FTC does play a significant role in protecting the digital citizen. However, individuals' public records are increasingly useful to the government and highly sought after. This is because this material can help the government detect a variety of crime such as fraud, drug distribution rings, terrorist cells, and so forth. This allows for an easier ability to properly profile a suspected criminal and keep an eye on them . Although there are a variety of ways to gather information on an individual through credit card history, employment history, and so on- the internet is becoming the most desirable information gatherer. The two aspects that have caused the internet to be a greater collector of information is the façade of security and amount of information that can be stored on the internet. [[Internet anonymity|Anonymity]] is proven to be very rare online as [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s can keep track of an individual, account information, web surfing durations, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/dsolove/Digital-Person/text/Digital-Person-CH9.pdf The Digital Person - Technology and Privacy in the Information Age - Chapter 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The nine elements of digital citizenship==
According to digitalcitizenship.net, the nine elements (or themes) of digital citizenship are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalcitizenship.net/nine-elements.html Nine Themes of Digital Citizenship], digitalcitizenship.net&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Digital access''': This is perhaps one of the most fundamental blocks to being a digital citizen. However, due to socioeconomic status, location, and other disabilities- some individuals may not have digital access. Recently, schools have been becoming more connected with the internet, often offering computers, and other forms of access. This can be offered through kiosks, community centers, and open labs. This most often is associated with the digital divide and factors associated with such.  Digital access is available in many remote countries via cyber cafés and small coffee shops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iste.org/docs/excerpts/DIGCI2-excerpt.pdf Digital Citizenship in Schools - Excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Digital commerce''': This is the ability for users to recognize that much of the economy is regulated online. It also deals with the understanding of the dangers and benefits of online buying, using credit cards online, and so forth. As with the advantages and legal activities- there is also dangerous activities such as illegal downloads, gambling, drug deals, pornography, plagiarism, and so forth. 
#'''Digital communication''': This element deals with understanding the variety of online communication mediums such as email, instant messaging, Facebook messenger, the variety of apps, and so forth. There is a standard of etiquette associated with each medium.
#'''[[Digital literacy]]''': This deals with the understanding of how to use various digital devices. For example, how to properly search for something on a search engine versus a database. How to use various online logs. Oftentimes many educational institutions will help form an individual's digital literacy.
#'''Digital etiquette''': As discussed in the third element, digital communication, this is the expectation that various mediums require a variety of etiquette. Certain mediums demand more appropriate behavior and language than others.
#'''Digital law''': This is where enforcement occurs for illegal downloads, plagiarizing, hacking, creating viruses, sending spams, identity theft, cyberbullying, and so forth. 
#'''Digital rights and responsibilities''': This is the set of rights digital citizens have such as privacy, speech, and so forth. 
#'''Digital health''': Digital citizens must be aware of the physical stress placed on their bodies by internet usage. They must be aware to not become overly dependent on the internet causing eye strain, headaches, stress problems, and so on.
#'''Digital security''': This simply means that citizens must take measures to be safe by practicing using difficult passwords, virus protection, backing up data, and so forth.

==The Three Principles of Digital Citizenship==
Digital Citizenship is a term used to define the appropriate and responsible use of [[technology]] among users.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.virtuallibrary.info/digital-citizenship.html|title=Digital Citizenship|website=Virtual Library|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three principles were developed by Mark Ribble to teach digital users how to responsibly use technology to become a digital citizen. The three principles include: respect, educate, and protect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iste.org/explore/articleDetail?articleid=535|title=Digital citizenship is more important than ever|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each principle contains three of the nine elements of digital citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalcitizenship.net/nine-elements.html|title=Nine Elements|website=Digital Citizenship|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''Respect:''' the elements of etiquette, access, and law are used to respect other digital users.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# '''Educate:''' the elements of literacy, communication, and commerce are used to learn about the appropriate use of the digital world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# '''Protect:''' the elements of rights and responsibilities, security, and health and wellness are used to remain safe in the digital and non-digital world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

==The Overlapping Goals of Digital Citizenship Education==
According to DigCit.us, the overlapping goals of digital citizenship education include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://digcit.us/ About Digital Citizenship Conversations], digcit.us&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Digital Footprint'''
#'''Digital Literacy'''
#'''Information Literacy'''
#'''Copyright, Intellectual Property Respect, Attribution'''

[[File:Plus-energie-haus-ffm-033.jpg|thumb|Prototype in Germany]]
An '''energy-plus house''' (also called: Plus-Energy House, Efficiency-Plus House) produces more energy from [[renewable energy]] sources, over the course of a year, than it imports from external sources. This is achieved using a combination of [[microgeneration]] technology and [[low-energy building]] techniques, such as: [[passive solar building design]], [[Building insulation|insulation]] and careful site selection and placement. A reduction of [[modern conveniences]] can also contribute to energy savings, however many energy-plus houses are almost indistinguishable from a traditional home, preferring instead to use highly energy-efficient appliances, fixtures, etc., throughout the house.

'''''Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc.''''', 472 U.S. 703 (1985), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that a state statute providing employees with an absolute right not to work on their chosen [[Sabbath]] violates the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|First Amendment]].

==Background==
The case concerned the constitutionality of a [[Connecticut]] state statute, which provided that "[n]o person who states that a particular day of the week is observed as his Sabbath may be required by his employer to work on such day. An employee's refusal to work on his Sabbath shall not constitute grounds for his dismissal."

Donald E. Thornton begin working as a store department manager for [[Caldor]], Inc., a chain of retail stores, in 1975. At that time, Connecticut's [[blue laws]] required retail stores to close on Sunday, but the law was changed in 1977. As a result, Caldor required Thornton to work one Sunday out of each four. Thornton complied for several months but in 1978, he advised Caldor that he observed Sunday as his Sabbath and would no longer work on Sundays. Caldor told Thornton that it could not accommodate his unwillingness to work Sundays in his current job. It offered either to transfer him to a comparable management job at a store in Massachusetts that was closed on Sunday, or to transfer him to a non-management position in his current store at a lower salary. Although Thornton did not accept either suggestion, in 1980 Caldor transferred Thornton to a clerical position that was not assigned to work Sundays.

Thornton resigned and filed a complaint with a Connecticut state agency, asserting that Caldor had illegally discharged him for refusing to work on his Sabbath. Caldor responded that Thornton had not been "discharged" for purposes of the statute, and also contended that the statute was unconstitutional under the religion clauses of the United States and Connecticut Constitutions.

The agency sided with Thornton, ordering Caldor to reinstate Thornton to his prior position with back pay and benefits, and the [[Connecticut Superior Court]] affirmed the agency's determination. On appeal, however, the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]] reversed, holding that because the statute lacked a "clear secular purpose" and its "primary effect" was to confer a religious benefit, it was unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

Thornton sought review by the United States Supreme Court, which granted [[certiorari]]. While the case was pending, Thornton died, and his estate was substituted as a party. At argument, Thornton's estate was represented by [[Nathan Lewin]], and Caldor by [[Paul Gewirtz]].

==Opinion==
[[Warren E. Burger|Chief Justice Burger]] wrote the opinion of the Court, which was joined by seven other Justices. The Court affirmed the Connecticut Supreme Court's holding that the statute in question violated the First Amendment. In a relatively brief opinion, Burger explained that it was unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause for a state to require employers to relieve an employee of work on his or her Sabbath, as "an absolute and unqualified right" that applied "no matter what burden or inconvenience this imposes on the employer or fellow workers." The Court concluded that "[t]his unyielding weighting in favor of Sabbath observers over all other interests contravenes a fundamental purpose of the Religion Clauses."

===Concurring opinion===
[[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]] filed a three-paragraph concurring opinion, joined by [[Thurgood Marshall|Justice Marshall]] emphasizing that the Court's ruling was based on the "special and absolute protection" that the Connecticut statute provided to Sabbath observers. However, she concluded that more broadly worded religious accommodation requirements, such as those contained in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], would not be similarly invalid. In O'Connor's view, a statute requiring "reasonable rather than absolute accommodation" and applying to all religious beliefs and practices "serves the valid secular purpose of securing employment opportunity to all groups in our pluralistic society."

===Dissent===
[[William H. Rehnquist|Justice Rehnquist]] dissented from the Court's judgment, but did not write an opinion.

The '''European Association of Bodies and Public Organizations of Security and Defense''' (known in French as ''Association Européenne des Corps et Organismes Publiques de Sécurité et de Défense'' or ''AE-COPSD'') is a non-profit, voluntary association of individuals who work in various [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] and detachments across [[Europe]]. Its primary purpose is to organize and promote joint training and skills development activities for law enforcement professionals who work in [[police]], [[corrections]], [[military police]], and other first responder units in various European nations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; They also organizes recreational events and competitions for its members. These include shooting competitions where members are encouraged to compete in various national [[marksmanship]] competitions. In addition to encouraging participation in international (European) sports competitions, they also organizes events where individuals from member agencies compete for the [[AE-COPSD Sports badge]]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the more notable and participated events are the [[paratrooper]] events were the host [[country]] has a certified military jump master at the jump zone. This is because many members are also in their [[countries]] military reserve. They can be awarded Jump Wings from the host country and also the [[AE-COPSD Paratroopers Wings]].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AE-COPSD also awards the [[AE-COPSD European Police Cross of Honor]]. This medal can be awarded to any law enforcement official from any country who, in the ''opinion'' of '''AE-COPSD'''; shows the highest standards of '''Loyalty''', '''Integrity''' &amp; '''Courage'''. The Cross of Honor is not limited to professionals from Europe.

'''Food sampling''' is a process used to check that a food is safe and that it does not contain harmful [[food contaminant|contaminants]], or that it contains only permitted [[food additive|additives]] at acceptable levels, or that it contains the right levels of key ingredients and its label declarations are correct, or to know the levels of [[nutrient]]s present.

A food sample is carried out by subjecting the product to physical analysis.  Analysis may be undertaken by or on behalf of a manufacturer regarding their own product, or for official food law enforcement or control purposes, or for research or public information.

To undertake any analysis, unless the whole amount of food to be considered is very small so that the food can be used for testing in its entirety, it is usually necessary for a portion of it to be taken (e.g. a small quantity from a full production batch, or a portion of what is on sale in a shop) – this process is known as food sampling.  

In most cases with food to be analysed there are two levels of sampling – the first being selection of a portion from the whole, which is then submitted to a laboratory for testing, and the second being the laboratory’s taking of the individual amounts necessary for individual tests that may be applied.  It is the former that is ‘food sampling’: the latter is analytical laboratory ‘sub-sampling’, often relying upon initial homogenisation of the entire submitted sample.  

Where it is intended that the results of any analysis to relate to the food as a whole it is crucially important that the sample is representative of that whole – and the results of any analysis can only be meaningful if the sampling is undertaken effectively.  This is true whether the ‘whole’ is a manufacturer’s entire production batch, or where it is a single item but too large to all be used for the test.  

Factors relevant in considering the representativeness of a sample include the homogeneity of the food, the relative sizes of the sample to be taken and the whole, the potential degree of variation of the parameter(s) in question through the whole, and the significance and intended use of the analytical result.

==Sampling by manufacturers ==

Food manufacturers and producers would need to satisfy themselves that any sample taken for analysis is sufficiently representative of the food for the analytical result to be meaningful.  This is true whether the data are to be used as the basis of labelling declarations, assurance of compliance with legislative or other standards, monitoring of production as part of [[HACCP]] (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points), or for routine quality control.

In the United Kingdom although various guidance is available, either from manufacturers’ associations or from sources of standards such as [[British Standards|British Standards Institution]] (such as British Standard BS6001), some of which may be relevant to certain food types. It is largely down to manufacturers to make their own evaluations of need and suitability.  This must be translated into an assessment both of sample portion size and number, and the frequency of taking samples.

==Testing and Methods of Analysis==

To ensure food safety and quality, some food samples which are perishable require certain tests and analyses. 
The following tests and analyses can be conducted:
* [[Food allergy|Food allergen]] testing
* Food chemical analysis
* Food contact tests
* [[Food contaminant]] testing
* [[Nutrition analysis|Nutritional analysis]] and testing
* [[GMO]] testing
* [[Melamine]] contamination testing
* Microbiological tests
* [[Spiral plater|Spiral plating]] for bacterial count
* [[Pesticide residue]] testing
* Veterinary drug residue testing
* [[PCR food testing]]

== Food law enforcement (UK)==

In the [[United Kingdom]], enforcement is under the Food Safety Act 1990.  Food sampling is undertaken primarily by [[Local government|local authorities]] and port health authorities for submission to [[public analyst]]s for analysis.  Much of the legislation relates to food as supplied to a consumer, meaning that every portion of a size of perishable food and foods at risk as may be supplied to a consumer has to comply, so that in such cases the sample submitted for analysis could simply be an entire consumer-sized portion.  There are exceptions, however, such as the sampling of nut products for the presence of [[aflatoxin]]s, which stipulate a primary sample size related to the size of the consignment – with associated requirements for initial homogenisation to produce a smaller sample to be sent for analysis.

The [[Food Safety Act 1990]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/Ukpga_19900016_en_1.htm|title=UK Food Safety Act 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; affords a right for defence analysis, and for referee analysis in case of disputed analytical results, by stipulating that except where to do so would prevent effective analysis the sample must be divided into three parts.  The UK [[Food Standards Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/|title=Food Standards Agency - Homepage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides supplementary guidance to the enforcement authorities to assist with the sampling process and associated decisions by sampling officers.

There is no set frequency or rate for the sampling of food for law enforcement in the UK.  Between the 1930s and 1990s there had been a guideline minimum rate for sampling for chemical analysis (not including samples for microbiological examination) of  2.5 samples per annum per 1000 head of population, however that was an arbitrary figure and more recent thinking suggested that the selection of a frequency for sampling should be based on risk.  In this context risk includes all 'consumer protection' issues such as pecuniary disadvantage from substandard or counterfeit products, as well as risk to health. The [[Association of Public Analysts]] was commissioned by the Food Standards Agency to look into this, culminating in a scheme for ''Risk Based Sampling'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.publicanalyst.com/Risk_Based_Sampling_Vol_1.pdf|title=Risk Based Sampling - Vol 1:Risk Assessment for Sampling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.publicanalyst.com/Risk_Based_Sampling_Vol_2.pdf|title=Risk Based Sampling - Vol 2:Background and support}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it has not yet been adopted by the enforcement authorities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3657">A '''franchise tax''' is a government levy (tax) charged by some [[US states]] to certain business organizations such as [[corporations]] and [[partnerships]] with a nexus in the state.  A franchise tax is not based on income.  Rather, the typical franchise tax calculation is based on the [[net worth]] of or capital held by the entity. The franchise tax effectively charges corporations for the privilege of doing business in the state.&lt;ref name="Iowa Survey"&gt;https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/IR/951.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chron.com"&gt;http://smallbusiness.chron.com/corporate-franchise-tax-vs-income-tax-66247.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nexus==
Whether or not a business must pay a franchise tax to a state in which it does business can cause some confusion. Some states report using both the economic and physical presence tests, and in some states, there are no written, public interpretations of their test at all.&lt;ref name="Baker Tilly"&gt;Baker Tilly, 2016 Midyear State and Local Tax Update. http://www.bakertilly.com/insights/midyear-state-and-local-tax-update-income-and-franchise-taxes/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quill==
The physical presence test is based on [[Quill Corp. v. North Dakota]], ( 504 U.S. 298 (1992)), a United States Supreme Court ruling concerning use tax. Quill Corporation is an office supply retailer. Quill had no physical presence in North Dakota (neither a sales force, nor a retail outlet), but it had a licensed computer software program that some of its North Dakota customers used for checking Quill's current inventories and placing orders directly. North Dakota attempted to impose a use tax on Quill, which was struck down by the Supreme Court, because Quill had no physical presence in North Dakota.

The ''Quill'' physical presence test is used by some states to determine whether or not a company must pay franchise tax. Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Texas report using the physical presence test.&lt;ref name= "Baker Tilly" /&gt;

==Economic Presence Test==
Many states apply an "economic presence" test to determine whether a business will be subject to state sales or franchise tax. This test, which seems to contradict Quill, implied that States have the right to tax or "nexus" solely on the basis that a company has sales or otherwise derives an economic benefit from activities within their borders.&lt;ref name= "Baker Tilly" /&gt;

==Amount==
About half the U.S. states do not impose a franchise tax.&lt;ref name="Journal of Accountancy"&gt;Journal of Accountancy, Navigating Nexus. http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2010/nov/20102904.html&lt;/ref&gt; For states that have a franchise tax, the amount is often either a flat fee or based on the size of the business's total holdings.&lt;ref name= "Chron.com" /&gt;

==Relationship To Corporate Tax==
States with higher [[Corporate tax#Taxable income|corporate income taxes]] usually have low or no franchise taxes and vice versa.

==Delaware==
The state of [[Delaware]] has a significant franchise tax.&lt;ref&gt;State of Delaware, Annual Report and Tax Information. https://corp.delaware.gov/frtax.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Other states have either nominal taxes or none at all.

'''Goodwin Hon Liu''' (born October 19, 1970) is an [[United States|American]] lawyer, educator and an Associate Justice of the [[Supreme Court of California]]. Before his appointment by [[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Jerry Brown]], Liu was Associate Dean and Professor of Law at the [[UC Berkeley School of Law|University of California, Berkeley School of Law]] (Boalt Hall).&lt;ref name="law.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=4360 |title=Berkeley Law - Faculty Profiles |publisher=[[UC Berkeley School of Law]] |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liu has been recognized for his writing on [[constitutional law]], education policy, [[civil rights]], and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="law.berkeley.edu"/&gt;

On February 24, 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] nominated Liu to fill a vacancy on the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]].&lt;ref name=whgov_20100224&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-nominates-goodwin-liu-united-states-court-appeals-ninth-circuit-jud "President Obama Nominates Goodwin Liu for the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Judge Robert N. Chatigny for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit"], whitehouse.gov (February 24, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; For more than a year, Liu's nomination languished, amid significant opposition from Republicans in the U.S. Senate. On May 19, 2011, the Senate rejected [[cloture]] on Liu's nomination in a 52–43 vote,&lt;ref name="senate2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00074 |title=Senate Roll Call |publisher=Senate.gov |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on May 25, 2011, Liu informed President Obama that he was withdrawing his name from consideration to the seat on the Ninth Circuit, telling the president that "With no possibility of an up-or-down vote on the horizon, my family and I have decided that it is time for us to regain the ability to make plans for the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dahlia Lithwick |title=Goodwin Liu Withdraws |date=May 25, 2011 |publisher=Slate |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2295572/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2011, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] nominated Liu to a seat on the [[Supreme Court of California]], succeeding Associate Justice [[Carlos R. Moreno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/07/26/BA071KF8DV.DTL|title=Brown nominates Goodwin Liu for state high court|date=July 27, 2011|first=Bob|last=Egelko|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, President Obama formally notified the [[United States Senate|Senate]] that he was withdrawing Liu's nomination for the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;ref name="thomas.loc.gov"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19971224191949/http://thomas.loc.gov/ Congressional Record for the Senate of July 29, 2011]&lt;!-- this is a home page, not a page for a past date --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was sworn into the California Supreme Court on September 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Egelko|first1=Bob|title=Why you should care about who will sit on California's Supreme Court|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/Why-you-should-care-about-who-will-sit-on-11541975.php|accessdate=August 20, 2017|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Liu was born in [[Augusta, Georgia]],&lt;ref name=whgov_20100224/&gt; of [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] descent,&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyCVPDF.php?facID=4360|title=Goodwin Liu Curriculum Vitae |publisher=Law.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02|quote=The son of Taiwanese immigrants, Professor Liu grew up in Sacramento, where he attended public schools.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second son of Wen-Pen and Yang-Ching Liu, both of whom came to the United States from [[Taiwan]] in the late 1960s, when foreign doctors were being recruited to work in underserved areas. Liu and his family moved to [[Clewiston, Florida]], shortly after his birth and then in 1977, they relocated to [[Sacramento, California]], where Liu graduated from [[Rio Americano High School]]. He earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in biology at [[Stanford University]]. While there he was active in student politics as a member of the People's Platform, serving on the Council of Presidents of the ASSU. He attended [[Oxford University]] on a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and earned a [[Master of Philosophy|M. Phil]] in philosophy and physiology. Liu received his  [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Yale Law School]].&lt;ref name="Berkeley Law - Faculty Profiles"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=4360|title=Goodwin Liu - Berkeley Law - Faculty Profiles |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |date= |accessdate=2014-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Goodwin Liu.png|thumb|Liu speaking]]
Liu initially worked as an appellate litigator at [[O'Melveny &amp; Myers]] in Washington. He later clerked for Judge [[David S. Tatel]] of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]] and then for [[U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], where among other things, he contributed a draft to her dissent in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=96546&amp;tsp=1|title=Goodwin Liu had a hand in Bush v.

He is also a former Chair of the Board of Directors of the [[American Constitution Society]].&lt;ref name="Brownnominee" /&gt;

He is currently a professor at [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He was elected to the [[American Law Institute]] in May 2008 and was elected to the ALI Council in May 2013. He currently serves as the chair of the ALI's committee on the Young Scholars Medal. He serves on the boards of the [[National Women's Law Center]] and the [[Alliance for Excellent Education]].&lt;ref name="Brownnominee" /&gt;

===Professorship===
He took a job at [[Boalt Hall]] at the UC Berkeley, where he became Associate Dean and Professor of Law.&lt;ref name="law.berkeley.edu" /&gt; In 2009 Liu was awarded the UC Berkeley Distinguished Teaching Award.&lt;ref name="Brownnominee" /&gt;

On February 24, 2010, President Obama nominated Liu to a new judgeship seat on the Ninth Circuit created by the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007; which became effective on January 21, 2009. His nomination was filibustered by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and expired with the [[sine die|sine die adjournment]] of the 111th Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_16914047 "Boalt dean Liu's nomination to federal appeals court appears dead -- for now"].&lt;/ref&gt; He was renominated to the same position on the first full day of the 112th Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Kurtz |url=http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2011/01/round_2.php?ref=fpblg |title=Round 2 |publisher=Talking Points Memo |date=2011-01-05 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perez|first=Evan|title=Obama Tries Again on Judicial Nominees|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704405704576064313360354954?mod=googlenews_wsj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=4 February 2011|date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 7, 2011 the Senate Judiciary Committee reported his nomination to the floor of the Senate by a 10–8 vote.&lt;ref name="senate1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov |title=Senate Judiciary Committee |publisher=Judiciary.senate.gov |date=2010-07-08 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Liu's nomination was harshly criticized by Senate Republicans for allegedly failing to disclose 117 of his more controversial writings and speeches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/04/06/republicans-slam-obama-nominee-omissions-record/ "Republicans Slam Obama Judicial Nominee Over 117 Omissions From Record"], FOX News, April 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2010, Liu submitted the 117 requested items to the committee as a supplemental to the original questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ben | last=Pershing | title=Senate Democrats defend 9th Circuit Court nominee Liu against GOP criticism | date=April 7, 2010 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/07/AR2010040703034.html?hpid=moreheadlines | work=The Washington Post | accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee hearing had been postponed twice particularly due to Republican opposition to Liu's judicial qualifications and record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/91017-leahy-to-forge-ahead-with-liu-hearing-despite-gop-objections "Leahy to forge ahead with Liu hearing despite GOP objections"], ''The Hill'', April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Liu defended his writings as a scholar by saying that "there's a clear difference between what things people write as scholars and how one would approach the role of a judge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/2010-06-15-diversity-lower-courts_N.htm|title=Obama's push for court diversity hits snag|newspaper=[[USA Today]] |author=Biskupic, Joan|date= 2010-06-15|accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2010, a letter was sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy by the seven committee Republicans to request a third postponement, which was subsequently rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Leahy won't delay hearing for appeals court pick criticism | date=April 7, 2010 | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j8bJNmgkNXos7jmYkKGzZWbuSe6QD9EUBSK80 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liu was also criticized for lack of trial-level experience. Prior to his nomination, Liu had not served as a judge and had argued only one case at the appellate court level as a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=35864 |title=Liu Nomination Pushes 9th Circuit Farther Left |publisher=Human Events |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liu's criticism of Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] and especially his statement during [[Samuel Alito]]'s Supreme Court nomination "Judge Alito's record envisions an America where police may shoot and kill an unarmed boy to stop him from running away with a stolen purse; where federal agents may point guns at ordinary citizens during a raid, even after no sign of resistance, where a black man may be sentenced to death by an all-white jury for killing a white man, absent [an] analysis showing discrimination, is not the America we know.

Liu later apologized and said that his words were "unduly harsh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/us/politics/20congress.html|title=G.O.P.

On May 17, 2011, Senator [[Harry Reid]] filed a [[cloture]] motion on Liu's nomination.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/B?r112:@FIELD%28FLD003+s%29+@FIELD%28DDATE+20110517%29 |title=Congressional Record May 17, 2011, Senate, Items 17 &amp; 18 |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, 2011, the Senate rejected cloture in a mostly party-line vote of 52–43, with all but one Democrat ([[Ben Nelson]]) voting in favor of cloture and all but one Republican ([[Lisa Murkowski]]) voting against.&lt;ref name="senate2" /&gt; He became the first Obama judicial nominee to be successfully filibustered in the Senate.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/05/19/senate-republicans-may-defeat-obama-pick-bench-uc-/ |title=Obama pick for bench blocked by GOP |author=Larry Margasak |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2011-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519231931/http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/05/19/senate-republicans-may-defeat-obama-pick-bench-uc-/ |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the makeup of the Senate unlikely to change until after the 2012 election, Liu withdrew his name from consideration on May 25, 2011. On July 29, 2011, three days after California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] nominated Liu to a seat on the [[Supreme Court of California]], President Obama formally notified the [[United States Senate|Senate]] that he was withdrawing Liu's nomination for the 9th Circuit.&lt;ref name="thomas.loc.gov" /&gt; In a talk before The City Club of Cleveland on February 22, 2013, Liu commented that the confirmation process is "inherently a political process" and "the Constitution was designed to make it a political process." He noted, however, that the problem with the confirmation process is that it has become transformed into requiring 60 votes as opposed to a bare majority, which was not part of the Constitutional design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2PcG94Slbg|title=The Honorable Goodwin Liu 2.22.13|date= |accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goodwin Liu Confirmation.jpg|thumb|Justice Liu and his wife shaking hands with Governor [[Jerry Brown]] after his swearing-in ceremony.]]
On July 26, 2011, California Gov. [[Jerry Brown]] nominated Liu to a seat on the [[Supreme Court of California]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/executive_calendar/xcalv.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In submitting his nomination, Brown said that "[Liu] is a nationally recognized expert on constitutional law and has experience in private practice, [in] government service and in the academic community. I know that he will be an outstanding addition to our state supreme court."&lt;ref name="Brownnominee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=17139|title=Governor Brown Nominates Goodwin Liu for California Supreme Court|publisher=[[Governor of California]]|date=2011-07-26|accessdate=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liu responded to his nomination with a prepared statement: "I'm deeply honored by Governor Brown's nomination and look forward to the opportunity to serve the people of California on our state's highest court."&lt;ref name="Brownnominee" /&gt;

On August 30, the state bar commission that screens all nominees gave Liu a "unanimously well qualified" rating, describing him as "brilliant, impartial, and with a work ethic second to none ... [h]e has an unwavering commitment to equal access to justice and will treat all litigants fairly, without regard to wealth or position in society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/08/goodwin-lius-appointment-to-california-supreme-court-expected-to-be-confirmed.html|title=Goodwin Liu expected to be confirmed to California Supreme Court |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] blog |date=2011-08-30|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was confirmed unanimously the next day by Chief Justice [[Tani Cantil-Sakauye]], state Attorney General [[Kamala Harris]], and Presiding Justice Joan Dempsey-Klein, the senior-most presiding justice serving on the California Court of Appeal. Ten witnesses testified in favor of his nomination and none testified against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_18798618|title=Goodwin Liu confirmed to California Supreme Court|newspaper= [[San Jose Mercury News]] |author=Mintz, Howard|date=2011-08-31|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liu was sworn in on September 1, 2011, and took the bench on September 6, sitting on a procedural issue regarding the controversial ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'' case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/09/goodwin-liu-finally-takes-the-bench/|title=Goodwin Liu Takes the Bench on California Supreme Court|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=2011-09-06|accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the other justices employ five permanent staff as [[law clerk]]s, Justice Liu has returned to the traditional use of recent law school graduates as one-year clerks.&lt;ref name="LiuUCLA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Justice Goodwin Liu|title=How the California Supreme Court Actually Works|journal=[[UCLA Law Review]]|date=2014|volume=61|page=1246|url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/61-5-2.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opinions====
In his first year on the bench, Liu authored six decisions, all of them unanimous.

*''Kirby v. Immoos Fire Protection, Inc.''
*''Dicon Fiberoptics, Inc. v. Franchise Tax Board''
*''United Teachers of Los Angeles v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist.''
*''Coito v. Superior Court''
*''National Paint &amp; Coatings Assn., Inc. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.''
*''Parks v. MBNA American Bank''

He also authored the majority opinion in ''Apple v. Superior Court'', where he ruled that online retailers can continue asking for credit card holder's information, such as telephone numbers and home addresses, when completing a transaction with a credit card. The complaint arose from the Song-Beverly Credit Card Act of 1971, which sought to protect [[consumer privacy]] when purchasing products in a store. Liu instead ruled for Apple, concluding that "because we cannot make a square peg fit a round hole, we must conclude that online transactions involving electronically downloadable products fall outside the coverage of the statute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/ca/PubArticleCA.jsp?id=1202586978248|title=4-3 Ruling Backs Online Retailers Who Collect Cardholder Data|publisher=Law.com|date=February 4, 2013|author=Graham, Scott|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Justice Liu joined in the California Supreme Court's unauthored opinion, ''In re Hong Yen Chang'', which posthumously admitted Chang to the State Bar. Chang was denied admission to the bar by the court in 1890, due to the federal Chinese Exclusion Act. Justice Liu and the rest of the California Supreme Court abrogated the court's previous decision and held that "the discriminatory exclusion of Chang from the State Bar of California was a grievous wrong" that "denied Chang equal protection of the laws".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S223736.PDF ''In re Hong Yen Chang''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603191226/http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S223736.PDF |date=2015-06-03 }} (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
Liu leans socially liberal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elias|first1=Thomas D.|title=Column: Brown can put his stamp on California Supreme Court|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2014/07/01/thomas-d-elias-column-brown-can-put-his-stamp-on-california-supreme-court/|accessdate=September 22, 2017|work=San Jose Mercury News|date=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written in favor of [[affirmative action]], abortion rights, and [[same-sex marriage]] and has been critical of [[Water-boarding#Contemporary use and the United States|Bush-era waterboarding policy]] and the [[death penalty]]. In a 2008 article for the ''[[Stanford Law Review]]'', Liu advocated a constitutional right to receive welfare.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Rethinking+constitutional+welfare+rights.-a0194620614&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  His positions are predominantly left-leaning; however, Liu has supported charter schools and government-funded vouchers for private schools, particularly if used as a tool to "promote racial diversity."&lt;ref name="SFGate1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-14/news/18835339_1_nomination-of-samuel-alito-federal-appeals-court-goodwin-liu|title=Obama nominee Goodwin Liu an unassuming man|last=Egelko|first=Bob|date=March 14, 2010|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Liu has defended the California Supreme Court's practice of drafting its opinions before hearing oral arguments.&lt;ref name="LiuUCLA" /&gt;

Gerald Uelman, a professor and former Dean of the [[University of Santa Clara]] School of Law, was impressed with Liu's work, saying "He displays a very independent streak. His opinions are very well thought out and well reasoned." Bob Egelko, a legal affairs reporter for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', agreed, saying that "his dissents come within the ideological boundaries of [the California Supreme Court], which is an institution that in general moves incrementally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2013/09/08/5708024/court-watchers-view-california.html |title=Goodwin Liu isn't the left winger critics painted him to be |newspaper=[[The Sacramento Bee]] |date=September 8, 2013 |author=Sward, Susan |accessdate=November 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202221750/http://www.sacbee.com/2013/09/08/5708024/court-watchers-view-california.html |archivedate=December 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">The {{nihongo|'''Sword Abolishment Edict'''|廃刀令|Haitōrei}} was an [[edict]] issued by the [[Meiji government]] of Japan on March 28, 1876 which prohibited people, with the exception of former lords (''[[daimyō]]s''), the military and law enforcement officials, from carrying weapons in public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zPyswmGDBFkC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=showato&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZAuWT6uNNq2d6AGxh-zIDg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=showato&amp;f=false ''The Connoisseur's Book of Japanese Swords''], Author Kōkan Nagayama, Publisher Kodansha International, 1997 {{ISBN|978-4-7700-2071-0}} P.43&lt;/ref&gt; Violators would have their [[Japanese swords|swords]] confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;Keene, ''Emperor Of Japan: Meiji And His World, 1852–1912''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''Haitōrei'' was one of a series of steps taken by the government to abolish the traditional privileges of the ''[[samurai]]'' class. The first ''Haitōrei'' of 1870 prohibited farmers or merchants from wearing swords and dressing like ''samurai''.&lt;ref name="Kapp, Modern Japanese Swords pp.37"&gt;Kapp, Modern Japanese Swords pp.37&lt;/ref&gt; This measure was in part an effort to restore [[public safety]] and order during the tumultuous period immediately after the [[Meiji Restoration]] and during the [[Boshin War]].

In 1871, the government issued the ''[[Danpatsurei]]'' Edict, allowing ''samurai'' to cut their [[chonmage|top-knots]] and wear their hair in the Western manner. However, this was not required, simply allowed and encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Suzanne G. "Splitting Hairs: History and the Politics of Daily Life in Nineteenth-Century Japan." The Journal of Asian Studies 67, no. 4 (2008): 1325.&lt;/ref&gt; Universal [[military conscription]] was instituted in 1873, and with the creation of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], the ''samurai'' lost their monopoly on military service. The hereditary stipends provided to the ''samurai'' by their formal feudal lords (and assumed by the central government in 1871) were likewise abolished in 1873. The prohibition on wearing swords was controversial with the [[Meiji oligarchy]], but the argument that it was an [[anachronism]] not in keeping with the westernization of Japan won out.&lt;ref&gt;Keene, ''Emperor Of Japan: Meiji And His World, 1852–1912'', pp 257&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes in [[Japanese society]] and in the social and economic status of the ''samurai'' were a major cause of discontent in early [[Meiji period]] Japan, and led to a number of ''samurai''-led insurrections, particularly in western Japan and [[Kyūshū]].

Also as a result of the ''Haitōrei'', swords lost their utilitarian role, and many swordsmiths were forced to turn to the production of farming implements and kitchen [[cutlery]] to survive.&lt;ref name="Kapp, Modern Japanese Swords pp.37"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34522">The '''history of Japanese nationality''' as a chronology of evolving concepts and practices begins in the mid-nineteenth century, as Japan opened diplomatic relations with the west and a modern [[nation state]] was established through the [[Meiji Restoration]].

==Pre-modern Japan==
Until the Meiji Restoration, Japanese people were subject to both the local authority of the ''[[daimyō]]'' and the national authority of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], who pledged allegiance to the Emperor. A concrete example of the shōgun acting directly on Japanese people as a nationality would be blanket recall of Japanese people from all other nations during the [[sakoku]] period, which resulted in the end of communities like [[Nihonmachi]] in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Innes, Robert L. ''The Door Ajar: Japan's Foreign Trade in the Seventeenth Century''. PhD diss. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of Japan as a nation was a topic for scholarly inquiry during much of the [[Edo period]].

==Practices initiated in Meiji period==
Nationality practices during the first decades of the Meiji government were shaped by pressure to conform to western norms.  Meiji oligarchs saw adopting the technology and institutions of western powers not only as essential to regaining sovereignty rights lost in the [[unequal treaties]] but also as an effective means of national strengthening.  Like the reforms of other modernizing states, the legal and institutional changes of the early Meiji period involved rationalizing the population, making the relationship between the individual and the state more direct, and codifying the rights and obligations associated with that relationship. By the late 1880s, Japanese leaders were increasingly preoccupied with the idea of cultivating a distinctive sense of the nation, or [[kokutai]] (国体) among Japanese subjects.  This goal led to the emergence of new nationality practices—such as compulsory education, elections, and voluntary organizations—which, unlike earlier reforms based on borrowing from western models, were strongly shaped by the emerging ideology of [[Japanese nationalism]].

The following is a list of nationality practices initiated during the Meiji period (1868–1912).  Though these practices and the ideology that informed them changed over the course of the Meiji period and subsequent decades, they remained the core of Japanese nationality practice through [[World War II]].

===Legal practices===
As part of its modernizing program, the Meiji state replaced the [[Four divisions of society|feudal class system]] with a much simpler set of status distinctions.  In 1872, the [[koseki]] ([[:ja:戸籍|戸籍]]), or family registry, system was established, requiring each family to register with the local government and notify authorities of births, marriages, adoptions, divorces, and deaths in the household.  The implementation of the koseki system meant that all families adopted a family name, a privilege which had previously been reserved for the warrior class.  Members of the [[burakumin]] ([[:ja:部落民|部落民]]), or outcaste group, were legally emancipated in 1871. This made their legal status equal to other {{nihongo|commoners|平民|heimin}}, though the koseki of former burakumin families retained a record of that status, facilitating de facto discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Babu Gogineni, "The Buraku People of Japan," (International Humanist and Ethical Union, 2006), {{cite web |url=http://www.iheu.org/node/2453 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103035123/http://www.iheu.org/node/2453 |archivedate=2007-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other end of the social hierarchy, the status of [[samurai]] was gradually phased out.  Samurai stipends were commuted into government bonds in 1872 and former members of samurai households became commoners.  A small peerage, modeled on the British Peerage, was created from a combination of {{nihongo|court nobles|公家|kuge}} and former daimyō. Its members received a small stipend and, after 1899, were eligible to sit in the Upper House of the Diet.

Changes in personal status law were accompanied by the promulgation of comprehensive new law codes.  A [[Criminal Code of Japan|Criminal Code]], [[:ja:刑法|刑法]] (1882) [[Civil Code of Japan|Civil Code]] [[:ja:民法|民法]] (1898), and Commercial Code [[:ja:商法|商法]] (1890), were drafted with the cooperation of [[O-yatoi gaikokujin|foreign experts]].  These legal codes are a clear example of the effect of the effort to revise unequal treaties on nationality practice in Meiji Japan.  Because removing [[extraterritoriality]] provisions required convincing western powers that Japanese courts met modern standards, Meiji leaders moved quickly to implement a western-style legal system.  This meant that being governed by western style laws—applied uniformly throughout the nation—became part of being a subject of the new Japanese nation-state.  The Meiji-era legal codes remained the basis of Japanese law until the end of World War II.

===Obligations to the State===
The principal obligations associated with being a subject of the Japanese state were payment of taxes and, for men, military service.

The [[Land Tax Reform (Japan 1873)|Land Tax Reform]] (地租改正) of 1873 established a system of private land ownership and instituted monetary taxation.  As a result, payment of taxes became linked to one's individual status as a subject of the Japanese nation-state and was no longer a function of feudal status or place of residence.&lt;ref&gt;Marius B. Jansen ''The Making of Modern Japan'' (Cambridge, Belknap Press of Harvard University, 2000), 366–367.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Meiji Constitution, direct payment of taxes to the national government became the basis for political participation at the national level.

The Conscription Act (1873) was part of a sweeping military reform, replacing the independent samurai armies of the feudal domains with a national conscript army.  Reporting for the conscription exam at age twenty became a common experience for all Japanese men and military training exposed young men to nationalist ideology.    Initially, about 5 percent of eligible men were drafted, serving four years active duty and three years in the reserves. During the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Russo-Japanese War]], conscription rates rose to about 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen 336, 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Military conscription rates were extremely high during the Second World War.

===Political Rights===
The [[Meiji Constitution]] (1890) outlined a limited set of political rights.  Men who paid 15 yen in annual taxes to the national government had the right to vote in elections for the Lower House of the Diet, making just over 1 percent of the population eligible to vote in the first national election in 1890.  In 1900, the property qualification was lowered.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen 415, 447; [[Carol Gluck]], ''Japan's Modern Myths: Ideology in the Late Meiji Period'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1925 the [[General Election Law]] (普通選挙法) extended the franchise to all men aged 25 or older. In the 1920s, there was a movement for [[Suffrage in Japan|women's suffrage]].  Proposals to extend suffrage and other political rights to women were debated in the Lower House of the Diet, but failed to become law.

Political rights were most important during the period of [[Taishō period|Taishō Democracy]].  Yet, even during this decade of flourishing political parties, the importance of political rights for ordinary people was muted by the dominant role of non-elected groups in Japanese politics.  The significance of voting rights was also limited by a series of increasingly repressive [[Peace Preservation Law|Peace Preservation]] laws designed to mitigate the potentially destabalizing effects of popular party politics and prevent the spread of leftist ideologies.

===Education===
The most significant aspect of education as nationality practice in this period is the advent of compulsory primary education.  Universal primary education was first articulated as a state goal in the Education Act of 1872.  Since much of the responsibility for funding the new schools fell on local governments, its implementation was uneven.  Nevertheless, the school system expanded rapidly. The vast majority of Japanese children could expect to attend four years of primary school by around the start of the 20th century.  Initially, national education policy was focused on practical goals and had minimal ideological content.  In the 1880s, however, anxiety about over-enthusiastic westernization mounted and the need to educate subjects who would be enfranchised by the awaited constitution became apparent.  These concerns spurred debate about how the education system should promote moral conduct and strengthen national sentiment.  The key document in this respect is the Imperial Rescript on Education (1882).&lt;ref&gt;Gluck 109–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

A system of higher education was also established.  State-sponsored exchange students were an important part of the Meiji modernization program.

===Voluntary Associations===
The government fostered the development of an expanding number of voluntary associations which acted as channels through which ordinary people were exposed to nationalist ideology. These served to organize, indoctrinate, and mobilize various sectors of the population, including students, wives and mothers, and Shinto priests.&lt;ref&gt;Gluck, 10–13, 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nationality Practice and Territorial Expansion, 1874–1945==
Previous sections of this article deal with nationality practice in Japan without reference to the fact that the boundaries of Japan were changing during the period discussed.  This section addresses nationality practices in Japanese-controlled territory in light of this fact.  During the period of imperialist expansion, the term ''naichi'' (内地), or home territory, was used to distinguish Japan proper from its colonies.  Though, historically, its exact meaning varied, this section uses it in its narrowest sense, to refer to [[Honshū]], [[Shikoku]] and [[Kyūshū]].

===Okinawa===
Until the late 19th century, both [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] and the [[Satsuma Domain]] had claimed the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]] as a [[tributary state]]. In the 1870s, the Japanese government maneuvered to establish direct sovereignty over the Ryūkyū Islands. As part of a settlement with Qing government after the 1874 Japanese incursion into Taiwan, the Qing government renounced its claims, clearing the way for direct Japanese rule. The Ryūkyū King [[Shō Tai]] was declared a vassal of the Meiji court and his kingdom designated Ryukyu-han (琉球藩), or the feudal domain of Ryukyu.&lt;ref&gt;Note that feudal domains had been abolished in the rest of Japan the previous year, see [[Abolition of the han system]]&lt;/ref&gt; During the first years of Japanese control, King Shō Tai retained nominal authority, but Ryukyu was largely ruled by the [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Naimushō]] office in [[Naha]]. In 1879, the Japanese government tightened control over Ryukyu, forcing the King to withdraw and declaring Ryukyu a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] (Okinawa-ken 沖縄県).&lt;ref&gt;George H. Kerr, ''Okinawa: The History of an Island People'', (Boston: Tuttle Publishing, 2000) 363–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned about resistance from local elites, Japanese administrators moved gradually in implementing modernizing reforms. The standardization of household registration and the abolition of noble status occurred early on, followed by the extension of Japanese criminal law to Okinawa by 1880. Land reform was completed in 1903, ending communal tenure and establishing a system of direct land taxes paid in cash. The Conscription Law was applied to Okinawa in 1898. Political rights available to subjects in naichi prefectures were eventually extended to Okinawans. By 1920, Okinawans were represented in the Diet on the same basis as naichi Japanese. Beginning in the 1880s, the prefectural government also attempted to increase attendance in primary schools and participation in nationally organized voluntary associations, but the spread of these heavily ideological nationality practices was relatively slow. The spread of these practices was part of a trend towards cultural assimilation to Japanese norms. Partly as a result of government policies, many Okinawans abandoned traditional cultural practices and the [[Ryukyuan languages|Ryūkyū language]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerr 393–397; 400–401; 413–415; 424–429; 460.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this process in many ways resembled the modernizing and centralizing reforms affecting nationality practice in naichi prefectures, in Okinawa it had a distinct colonial dynamic.  The bureaucracy and the police in Okinawa were initially staffed almost exclusively by migrants from naichi Japan.  Naichi Japanese in Okinawa enjoyed privileged access to jobs and business opportunities, while Okinawans-by-birth suffered discrimination based on a perception of ethnic and cultural inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr 393.&lt;/ref&gt;

After initial travel restrictions were lifted, a significant number of Okinawans migrated to the main islands of Japan, where they tended to assimilate into local society, often encountering less discrimination than at home.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, travel restrictions 375, 378; migrants to Japan 442.&lt;/ref&gt;  Japanese nationality status gave Okinawan emigrants access to the protection of the Japanese government when abroad and to preferential treatment as settler colonists within the Japanese empire.  In practice, Okinawan emigrants experienced discrimination in areas where naichi Japanese immigrants had already settled. For this reason they tended to form distinct communities overseas.  By 1938, more than 70,000 Okinawans had emigrated outside the Japanese empire, principally to Hawai'i, South America and the Philippines.  By 1945, more than 50,000 Okinawans had migrated to other parts of the Japanese empire, notably to [[Office of the South Sea Islands|Nan'yōchō]].&lt;ref&gt;Yoko Sellek, "Migration and the Nation-State: Structural Explanations for Emigration from Okinawa", In ''Japan and Okinawa: Structure and Subjectivity'', Glenn D. Hook and Richard Siddle (London: Routledge Curzon 2003)79-81.  See also Tomiyama Ichirō, "The 'Japanese' of Micronesia: Okinawans in the Nan'yō Islands", In ''Okinawan Diaspora'', ed. Ronald Y. Nakasone, (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2002), 57–70, and Edith M. Kaneshiro, {{"'}}The Other Japanese': Okinawan Immigrants to the Philippines, 1903–1941", in ibid. 71-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hokkaidō===
Before 1855, Hokkaidō was loosely integrated into the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] state through the [[Matsumae clan|Matsumae domain]].  In 1855, concerned about military threat from Russia, the [[Shōgun|bakufu]] assumed direct control, but its authority remained weak and had relatively little effect on the native [[Ainu people|Ainu]] population.  After the Meiji Restoration, the new government established the Hokkaidō Colonization Commission ([[:ja:開拓使|北海道開拓使]]) to administer its northern territories.  The Colonization Commission and its successors promoted economic development and encouraged immigration from naichi Japan.  Early settlement schemes were unsuccessful, but beginning in the 1890s, generous land grant policies attracted tens of thousands of settlers each year.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Siddle, ''Race, Resistance and the Ainu of Japan'', (London: Routledge-Curzon, 1996), 52–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government also launched an aggressive assimilation effort directed at the Ainu population, an effort Richard Siddle characterizes as "a series of policies that attempted to turn the Ainu into productive Japanese citizens, but actually served to emphasise their inequality and subordination to the state."&lt;ref&gt;Siddle, 63&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, Ainu were granted legal status as commoners, subject to the same laws as naichi Japanese.  As with the burakumin, the government maintained separate records of their former status. As areas of naichi Japanese settlement expanded, Ainu were increasingly subject to forced relocation.  Traditional hunting techniques, as well as cultural practices such as tattooing and ear piercing, were legally banned.&lt;ref&gt;Siddle 61-63.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1899, the {{nihongo|Hokkaidō Former Natives Protection Act|[[:ja:北海道旧土人保護法|北海道旧土人保護法]]}} was passed.  It established a separate and compulsory school system, a program of land grants designed to encourage Ainu to adopt agriculture, and provided some welfare benefits.  Education in Ainu schools promoted cultural assimilation, including adopting the nationality practices of imperial Japan, such as joining nationally organized voluntary associations and serving in the military.&lt;ref&gt;Siddle 70–73.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ainu school system was abolished in 1927.

===Karafuto===
Nationality practices in [[Karafuto]], under joint Russian and Japanese control 1867–1875, and Japanese rule 1905–1945, were similar to those in Hokkaidō in that the Japanese administration pursued a policy of promoting economic development and settlement by naichi Japanese. The population of Ainu and other indigenous people&lt;ref&gt;See [[Oroks]] and [[Nivkhs]].&lt;/ref&gt; was very small in Karafuto. As in Hokkaidō, Ainu and indigenous people were forcibly resettled and subjected to a program of assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;On sovereignty, Siddle 53–54, 73–74; On policy towards Ainu and indigenous people, Siddle 66 and Tessa Morris-Suzuki, "Northern Lights: The Making and Unmaking of Karafuto Identity", ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 60:3 (2001), 659.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nationality issues arose out of complications related to changes in sovereignty in the nineteenth century.  For example, the status of Japanese and Ainu who had remained in Karafuto during the period of Russian rule between 1875 and 1905 was ambiguous. In some cases, these people were treated as Russian nationals.&lt;ref&gt;Siddle 63-4; Morris-Suzuki 659.&lt;/ref&gt; The other distinctive feature of nationality practice in Karafuto was immigration policy.  Though the immigration of unskilled laborers was illegal in the rest of Japan, several thousand Chinese [[coolie]]s were recruited to work as temporary migrant laborers in Karafuto between 1909 and 1927.  After 1927, they were replaced by migrants from Korea.  By 1945, more than 50,000 [[Sakhalin Koreans|Koreans]]—under varying degrees of coercion—had migrated to Karafuto.&lt;ref&gt;Morris-Suzuki 663.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
{{main|Taiwan under Japanese rule}}

Japan annexed Taiwan in 1895 after the First Sino-Japanese War.  Residents of Taiwan became subjects of Japan, but did not have the same status, rights and obligations as Japanese from the home islands.

===Korea===
{{main|Korea under Japanese rule}}

After decades of intervention in Korean affairs, Japan formally annexed Korea in 1910. Annexation meant that Koreans became subjects of the Japanese Emperor and were considered Japanese nationals by the Japanese government.  Despite this seemingly equal status, colonial policy facilitated differential treatment of Koreans.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} At the same time, it constituted an increasingly coercive program of assimilation into the Japanese state and Japanese cultural norms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The [[Sōshi-kaimei]] (創氏改名) laws established a Japanese-style family registry in Korea, and Koreans were permitted to use a Japanese-style family name (the Korean-style family name was not prohibited). This system was separate from the Japanese [[koseki]] system and it was illegal to move registration records between the two systems, thus preserving a legal difference between Koreans and naichi{{clarify|date=May 2017}} Japanese regardless of place of residence.&lt;ref&gt;Sonia Ryang, "Introduction: Resident Koreans in Japan", ''Notes from Koreans in Japan: Critical Voices from the Margin'', ed. Sonia Ryang (London: Routledge, 2000), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Naichi Japanese in Korea had privileged access to economic and educational resources.  They retained rights and obligations, such as the vote and military service, that they had in naichi Japan. Because Korea was administered through the [[Governor-General of Korea|Government General of Korea]], the laws issued by the Government General, rather than those of naichi Japan, determined the rights and obligations of Koreans to the state.  The education system promoted cultural assimilation of Koreans—both in its content and its use of Japanese as the primary language of instruction—but gave children of naichi Japanese families in Korea preferential treatment. In the 1930s, the assimilationist aspect of education in Korea intensified under the so-called {{nihongo|"becoming the Emperor's people" policy|[[:ja:皇民化|皇民化]]|kōminka}}. 1944, by national conscription decree, Koreans were conscripted as laborers for service in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Archives of Japan]] [http://www.digital.archives.go.jp/DAS/meta/listPhoto?KEYWORD=&amp;LANG=eng&amp;BID=F0000000000000008046&amp;ID=M0000000000001776250&amp;IS_STYLE=eng&amp;NO=]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Japan Navy decided to accept enlistees of the Koreans by the Royal Decree of July 28, 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Ryang 19, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[National Archives of Japan]]

Status as Imperial Japanese subjects gave Koreans a degree of mobility within Japanese controlled territory.  Though in 1945, Koreans were present as voluntary migrants, labour conscripts, soldiers, or [[comfort women]] in nearly every part of the Japanese Empire, the most significant Korean migrations were to naichi Japan and to [[Manchuria]].

Tens of thousands of impoverished Korean tenant farmers moved to Japan to find work.  There, they faced difficult working conditions, discrimination, government surveillance, and vigilante violence.     The Japanese government was anxious about the potentially destabilizing effect of Korean laborers in Japan; yet, because Koreans were legally Japanese nationals, it could not explicitly restrict immigration from Korea.  Instead, during economic downturns in Japan, colonial police in [[Pusan]] were instructed to restrict Korean emigration on an informal basis by limiting access to travel documents (旅行証明書).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Weiner, ''Race and Migration in Imperial Japan'', (London: Routledge, 1994), 63, 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Japan, Koreans came under the jurisdiction of the Japanese government proper, rather than the Government General of Korea.  This meant that they were governed by Japanese law and had greater [[civil and political rights]]—notably the right to hold meetings and vote in national elections—than Koreans in Korea. Political rights were especially important to the community of Korean students in Japan.  See [[Koreans in Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiner 64–68, 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]], the Japanese government pursued a more active policy of assimilation towards Koreans in Japan.  Primary school attendance was made compulsory in 1930, as was membership in the {{nihongo|Naisen-kyowa-kai|内鮮共和会||"Japan-Korea Harmony Society"}}.  This organization, tightly controlled by the Naimusho and the Government General of Korea,issued identity cards to its members, controlled the travel of Koreans between Korea and Japan, and organized labor mobilization, as well as sponsoring the cultural, social and ideological activities typical of other "voluntary" associations.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner 156–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the early 1900s, hundreds of thousands of Koreans migrated to Manchuria.  Though this territory was not under Japanese control, the Japanese government claimed Koreans in Chinese territory as Japanese nationals.  This contention was part a broader effort to dominate China (see [[Twenty-One Demands]]).  It meant that Japanese consulates claimed extraterritoriality privileges for Koreans in China and that Koreans were prohibited from naturalizing as Chinese citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara J. Brooks, "Peopleing the Japanese Empire: The Koreans in Manchuria and the Rhetoric of Inclusion", In ''Japan's Competing Modernities: Issues in Culture and Democracy 1900–1930'', ed. Sharon A. Minichiello (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 1998), 25, 27, 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[Mukden Incident]] and the establishment of [[Manchukuo]], Japanese authorities encouraged further Korean migration to Manchuria.  The nationality status of Koreans in Manchuria was ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;See Mariko Asano Tamanoi, "Knowledge, Power, and Racial Classification: The "Japanese" in “Manchuria"" ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 59:2 (2000), 248–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Japanese Nationality and Repatriation after World War II ==
When Japan [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered]] in August 1945, there were more than six million Japanese nationals outside of what is now Japan.  The process of repatriating these individuals—about half of whom were civilians—revealed the inconsistencies of nationality practice in the Japanese Empire.  Despite the rhetoric of equality, naichi (main lands) Japanese were treated differently from other Imperial subjects.

=== Koreans ===
During the summer and fall of 1945, hundreds of thousands of conscripted Korean laborers in Japan abandoned their jobs and returned to Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner 207.&lt;/ref&gt;  Defining the remaining 600,000 Koreans—many of whom were long-time residents or had been born in Japan—as foreigners, Japanese authorities began to limit the citizenship rights they had enjoyed as imperial subjects resident in Japan.  During the colonial period, it was illegal to transfer a Korean koseki to Japan; therefore, Japanese authorities were able to target residents of Japan whose names appeared on Korean koseki. See [[Koreans in Japan#Loss of Japanese nationality|Loss of Japanese nationality]].  Since Japan did not have diplomatic relations with either Korean government until 1965, Koreans remaining in Japan became officially stateless.

===Okinawans===
The treatment of Okinawans during the post-war repatriation programs reflected both the ambiguous status of Okinawans with the Japanese Empire and the strategic goals of the United States Military.  Interpreting "Okinawan" as a distinct nationality reinforced the legitimacy of governing Okinawa separately from the rest of Japan.  Okinawans, defined as individuals registered in an Okinawan koseki, were repatriated to Okinawa from both naichi Japan and former colonial territories in the Pacific.  About 56,900 Okinawans were repatriated from Nan'yōchō and the Philippines and as many as 79,000 from naichi Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Sellek 81–82; Leonard Weiss, "U.S. Military Government on Okinawa", ''Far Eastern Survey'' 15:15 (1946), 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Okinawans, repatriates were officially Japanese nationals but were governed by the [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryūkyū Islands]].  Okinawans who traveled overseas or emigrated during the period of US administration (1945–1972), were issued US travel documents rather than Japanese passports.&lt;ref&gt;Sellek, 81–86; see also "南米オキナワ村" ("South American 'Okinawa' village")　''海外移住資料館たより''　第６号(Japan International Cooperation Agency, 2006) available [http://www.jomm.jp/newsletter/tayori06_02.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese Colonists===
About 1.5 million Japanese who were left in Manchuria after the Soviet invasion were transferred to labor camps in Siberia, where they remained for as many as five years.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Warner, "Repatriate Organizations in Japan", ''Pacific Affairs'' 22:3 (1949), 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Since military personnel, government officials and employees of major companies had preferential treatment during the evacuation, rural settler colonists were overrepresented in this group.&lt;ref&gt;Greg P. Guelcher, "Paradise Lost: Japan's Agricultural Colonists in Manchukuo", In ''Japanese Diasporas'', 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Once they returned to Japan, settler colonists regained Japanese nationality, but their former status as colonial subjects continued to have meaning.  For example, colonists who had been conscripted into the Japanese militia in Manchuria were ineligible for the pension benefits available to other veterans of the Japanese military.&lt;ref&gt;Asano Tamanoi, "Knowledge" 258.&lt;/ref&gt; The same was true of Japanese veterans of the {{nihongo|paramilitary forces|軍属|gunzoku}} in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Shun Ohno, "The Intermarried Issei and ''mestizo'' Nisei in the Philippines: Reflections on the Origin of  Philippine Nikkeijin Problems", In ''Japanese Diasporas'', 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Japanese settler colonists left behind in China were women, and these Japanese women mostly married Chinese men and became known as "stranded war wives" (zanryu fujin).&lt;ref&gt;[http://japanfocus.org/-Rowena-Ward/2374/article.html Left Behind: Japan's Wartime Defeat and the Stranded Women of Manchukuo]&lt;/ref&gt; Because they had children fathered by Chinese men, the Japanese women were not allowed to bring their Chinese families back with them to Japan so most of them stayed. Japanese law only allowed children fathered by Japanese fathers to become Japanese citizens. 

==="Japanese Orphans" in China===
During the chaotic retreat from Manchuria, an estimated 10,000 children of Japanese colonists were left behind and adopted by Chinese families.  In the 1980s, the Japanese government instituted a program to facilitate the belated repatriation of these individuals, known as {{nihongo|[[Japanese orphans in China]]|[[:ja:中国残留日本人|残留孤児]]|zanryū koji}}.  Those who could locate their name on a prewar Japanese koseki were allowed to live in Japan indefinitely, but did not automatically regain Japanese nationality.  Approximately 20,000 orphans and their relatives have moved to Japan under this program.  Some "orphans" contend that, even if they undergo the cumbersome process of regaining Japanese nationality, they are not offered full citizenship because they have little access to social benefits, such as pensions, available to other Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Mariko Asano Tamanoi, "Overseas Japanese and the Challenges of Repatriation in Post-Colonial East Asia", In ''Japanese Diasporas: Unsung Pasts, Conflicting Presents, and Uncertain Futures'', ed. Nobuko Adachi (London: Routledge, 2006), 217–235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Nationality Practices in Japan==
The legal aspects of Japanese nationality are currently governed by the Nationality Act of 1950. It states that a person is a Japanese national if either of his or her parents is a Japanese national, provides for naturalization of aliens, and explains how Japanese nationality may be lost.

The '''indeterminacy debate in legal theory''' can be summed up as follows: Can the law constrain the results reached by adjudicators in legal disputes? Some members of the [[critical legal studies]] movement — primarily [[jurist|legal academics]] in the [[United States]] — argued that the answer to this question is "no." Another way to state this position is to suggest that disputes cannot be resolved with clear answers and thus there is at least some amount of uncertainty in legal reasoning and its application to disputes. A given body of legal doctrine is said to be "indeterminate" by demonstrating that every legal rule in that body of legal doctrine is opposed by a counterrule that can be used in a process of legal reasoning.

The ''indeterminacy thesis'' emerged as a far-left reply to [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s "right answer" thesis. In its strongest form it is an extreme version of [[legal realism]]. It argues that nothing is law until it has been promulgated by an official - either a judge or the legislature. For example, a statute that says "No person may smoke in a hospital" does not mean that "John Doe may not smoke in a hospital"; the second statement is the law only if a legitimate authority declares so.

This is because one cannot describe a legal statement as right or wrong without making a normative value judgment about what the law should be.{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}

In the 1990s the indeterminacy thesis came under heavy attack by [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Conservatism|conservative]] defenders of the [[rule of law]], and the debate, though its mantle is in the process of being taken up by a new generation of scholars, has left the intellectual spotlight for the time being.

The thesis can be criticised because the concept of legal mistake is recognised in a determinative theory of law. While such a mistake necessarily involves a normative judgment, it is not truly subjective. A positivist Hartian theory contends that this judgment is conventionally objective because the rule of recognition fails to recognise the mistake as legally valid. According to a liberal theory such as Dworkin's, the normativity of the judgment is one of reason rather than of value.

'''Julius Stone''' (7 July 1907 – 1985) was [[Challis Professor]] of [[Jurisprudence]] and [[International Law]] at the [[University of Sydney]] from 1942 to 1972, and thereafter a visiting Professor of Law at the [[University of New South Wales]] and concurrently Distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence and International Law at the [[Hastings College of Law]], [[University of California]].

He is the author of 27 books on jurisprudence and international law, and is hailed by his official biography at the Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence as one of the premier legal theorists.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence/juliusstone.shtml Biography of Julius Stone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623171512/http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence/juliusstone.shtml |date=23 June 2006 }}, Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence, Sydney Law School, University of Sydney.  URL accessed 5 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Stone was born in [[Leeds]], England to parents who were poor [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] refugees.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

==Education==
Stone received a scholarship to [[Oxford University]], where he earned Bachelor of Arts (Jurisprudence), [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] and [[Doctor of Civil Law]] degrees. He followed this with a [[Master of Laws]] from [[Leeds University]], and then a [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] from [[Harvard University]].

==Career==
Stone taught at Harvard, and briefly at Leeds, then went to [[New Zealand]] where he worked at [[Auckland University College]]. In 1942, he was appointed [[Challis Professor]] of Jurisprudence and International Law at the [[University of Sydney]], a position he held until 1972. Stone's appointment was controversial for several reasons; he was perceived to have a radical jurisprudential stance, some wanted the Chair to be held open until the end of the war as it was suggested that there were suitable candidates in active service. It was suspected that the fact that he was a Jew also played a role. A debate over his appointment was carried out in both the Australian parliament and local newspapers; the Chancellor of the University, and two Fellows of the University Senate, resigned in protest.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; This early experience of [[anti-Semitism]] influenced his lifelong commitment to justice, according to his biographer, Leonie Star (Star 1993).

Stone has been described by his official ''JSIJ'' biography as having "a life-long commitment to Israel"&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; and in the ''[[Sydney Law Review]]'' as having an emotional and "fierce loyalty to the State of Israel" that led some of his colleagues to "express fear even to discuss Israel with him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kirby|first1= Michael|authorlink=Michael Kirby (judge)|year=2005 |title= Julius Stone and the Struggle for the Soul of Law |journal= [[Sydney Law Review]] |publisher= [[University of Sydney]]  |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=323, 332 |url= http://sydney.edu.au/law/slr/docs_pdfs/editions/slr_v27_n2.pdf |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Stone moved to the [[University of New South Wales]], where he was a visiting Professor of Law until his death in 1985. While at University of New South Wales, he concurrently held the position of Distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence and International Law at the [[Hastings College of Law]], [[University of California]].

In 1999, 15 years after Stone's death, the University of Sydney established an institute of jurisprudence which was named after him, the Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="stone_inst"&gt;[http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence The Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614004212/http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence/ |date=14 June 2006 }} Accessed 21 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Stone influenced generations of lawyers who studied at University of Sydney. For most of his time there, the Law School was a practice-based school and students learnt what they needed to become practising lawyers. According to A J Brown of Griffith University, the former [[Justice]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] was heavily influenced at university by Stone. [http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24992503-5001030,00.html]

===Israeli settlements===
Stone's view is that [[Israeli settlements]] in the [[West Bank]] are legal under international law, and do not constitute a violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] (Article 49(6)). He stated:

"Irony would...be pushed to the absurdity of claiming that Article 49(6), designed to prevent repetition of Nazi-type genocidal policies of rendering Nazi metropolitan territories judenrein, has now come to mean that...the West Bank...must be made judenrein and must be so maintained, if necessary by the use of force by the government of Israel against its own inhabitants. Common sense as well as correct historical and functional context excludes so tyrannical a reading of Article 49(6.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=1&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=378&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=5603&amp;TTL=The_Settlements_Issue:_Distorting_the_Geneva_Convention_and_the_Oslo_Accords The Settlements Issue: Distorting the Geneva Convention and the Oslo Accords ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
*Award of the American Society of International Law (1956).
*Honorary life member of the American Society of International Law (1962). 
*[[Swiney Prize for Jurisprudence]] from the [[Royal Society of Arts]] (1964).
*World Research Award from the Washington Conference on World Peace through Law (1965).
*The Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence at Sydney Law School, [[University of Sydney]] is named in his honour.

==Criticism==
Stone has been criticised for his views in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] by [[Ben Saul]], saying: "Many of Stone’s positions on critical international legal issues in the Israel/Palestine conflict stepped outside even generous zones of plausible or reasonable interpretations of the law, even on the law as it then often ambiguously stood, and certainly in hindsight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ben Saul|year=2009|title=Julius Stone and the Question of Palestine in International Law|journal=Legal Studies Research Paper|issue= 09/106|pages=Abstract|publisher=University of Sidney|ssrn=1485056|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kembrew McLeod''' is an [[United States|American]] [[artist]], [[activism|activist]], and [[professor]] of [[Communication Studies]] at the [[University of Iowa]].

He is best known as a [[performance artist]] or "media prankster" who filed an application in 1997 to register the phrase "[[Freedom of Expression®|Freedom of Expression]]" as a [[trademark]] in the United States. This phrase was the name of his zine/artist book series, and on January 6, 1998, McLeod was granted registration no. 2127381 in Class 16 (for "booklets in the field of creative writing").

McLeod received his PhD from [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], an MA from the [[University of Virginia]], and a BS from [[James Madison University]].

==Dispute with AT&amp;T==
McLeod sought registration of the phrase "Freedom of Expression" as a reflection on the use of [[intellectual property]] law to restrict cultural expression in U.S. society. In 2003, McLeod sent [[AT&amp;T]] a [[cease and desist]] letter in response to an AT&amp;T advertising campaign in college newspapers promoting a new long distance plan which used the phrase "freedom of expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ives |first=Nat |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E2DF1E30F930A15752C0A9659C8B63 |title=The Media Business: Advertising – When marketers trip over trademarks, the fun begins|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2003-01-23 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLeod claimed that the use by AT&amp;T of his registered trademark could lead some consumers to infer a connection between his publication and AT&amp;T. ''[[The New York Times]]'' later interviewed McLeod, and reported that his aim was "to object to corporate power over words, speech and even [[idea]]s. 'I do want to register my genuine protest that a big company that really doesn't represent freedom of expression is trying to appropriate this phrase,' he said."

Registration no. 2127381 was cancelled in October 2004 when McLeod did not lodge documentary evidence with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] to demonstrate that "Freedom of Expression" had been used as a trademark.

==Protesting Bill Clinton over Sister Souljah controversy==
On December 10, 2007, McLeod protested a Bill Clinton event in [[Iowa City]], [[Iowa]], dressed as a [[robot]] and demanding an apology for remarks made by Clinton in 1992 about controversial hip hop musician [[Sister Souljah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071211/NEWS/71211011/-1/GALLERIES Desmoinesregister.com]{{dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before being removed by security and as he was led away, McLeod tossed multi-colored flyers into the air which included the name of a website, mr-ifobca.org, standing for "Mad Robots in Favor of Bill Clinton Apologizing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/politics/2007/12/11/vo.ia.clinton.heckled.robot.cnn |title=Video - Breaking News Videos from CNN.com |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=2006-11-16 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mr-ifobca.org/ Mr-ifobca.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other work==
McLeod's book built upon the themes raised by the AT&amp;T event and develops a serious critique on a range of diverse topics such as [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] music and [[sampling (music)|sampling]], the patenting of seeds and human [[genes]], folk and [[blues]] music, visual [[collage]] art, [[electronic voting]], and computer software, among other things.

McLeod has also written music criticism for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[The Village Voice]]'', ''[[Spin magazine|Spin]]'', and ''Mojo''. He is the coproducer of a 2001 [[documentary film]] on the music industry, ''Money for Nothing: Behind the Business of Pop Music,'' which he produced for the Media Education Foundation. He is currently working on another documentary on the history of sound collage, digital sampling, and intellectual property law, titled ''Copyright Criminals: This Is a Sampling Sport."

He participated in the exhibition "Illegal Art: Freedom of Expression in the Corporate Age," which was hosted by the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]'s Artist Gallery. In 2005, he helped co-found the Freedom of Expression® Security Consortium, which is dedicated to "Regulating Freedom of Expression in the Marketplace of Ideas".  He also is co-editor (with [[Ted Striphas]]) of a 2006 special issue of the journal ''Cultural Studies'' on "The Politics of Intellectual Properties," which is available for free on the internet.

His book, ''Freedom of Expression'', is available as a free PDF download with a [[Creative Commons]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freedomofexpression.us/documents/mcleod-freedomofexpression.pdf |title=Freedom of Gesundheit's Expressions |language=German |date=2015 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331090603/http://www.freedomofexpression.us/documents/mcleod-freedomofexpression.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, one chapter from ''Freedom of Expression'' was used as the basis for two essays in the [[United States Pirate Party]]'s book, ''No Safe Harbor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nosafeharbor.com | title=No Safe Harbor| date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kosher tax''' was one of several indirect taxes imposed by the Russian Imperial government and sometimes by [[Hapsburg empire]], Germany and Moldavia on Jews.&lt;ref name="ji"&gt;[[Herman Rosenthal|Rosenthal, Herman]]; [[Jacob Goodale Lipman|Lipman, J.G.]] [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=394&amp;letter=B "Basket-Tax"], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Belovinskiĭ2003p357"&gt;Leonid Vasilʹevich Belovinskiĭ.

==Russia==

In [[Russia]], the tax, known as the ''korobka'', was a tax paid only by Jews for each animal slaughtered in accordance with the [[kashrut]] rules and for each pound of this meat sold.&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/kraziai/history_tax_on_jews.htm Korobka Tax on Kraziai's Jews], Document 49-1-1362 from the Kaunas Archive&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the Russian Jewish "basket tax" or "box tax". Though it was used to refer to a tax on meat or slaughtering, the word ''korobka'' (Russian: коробка) actually means "box" in Russian. The tax came to be called that because Jews paying had to deposit a coin in a box at the kosher slaughterer.&lt;ref name=Diner2001p164&gt;[[Hasia R. Diner|Diner, Hasia R.]] ''Hungering for America: Italian, Irish, and Jewish Foodways in the Age of Migration'', [[Harvard University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00605-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zU1WYFWxn74C&amp;pg=PA164 p.&amp;nbsp;164.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herman Rosenthal]] and [[Jacob Goodale Lipman]], the tax was "the most burdensome and annoying of the special taxes imposed upon the Jews of Russia by the government".&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt; The burden of taxes, and the ''korobka'' in particular, was one of the factors which drove many Jews to abandon the towns and settle in villages or on noblemen estates.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica (1971): History, vol. 8, 734&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galicia==
With the annexation to Austria in 1772, special taxes were imposed on [[Galician Jews]] ("[[Ostjuden|Eastern Jews]]") for marriage permits, kosher meat, synagogues, and similar items.

Between 1777 to 1784, the Jews of [[Horodenka]], a region on the south-east corner of Galicia, paid a number of special taxes, including the "Protection and [[Tolerance tax|Tolerance Tax]]", and "Property and Occupation tax". In 1784, the Property and Occupation Tax was cancelled and replaced with the Kosher Meat Tax.&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, N. M. ''The History of the Jews of Horodenka'', p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moldavia==

In 1741, [[Moldavia]]n prince [[Grigore II Ghica|Grigore Ghica]] confirmed the obligation of each Jew to pay the ''crupca'', an indirect tax on kosher meat similar to the Russian ''korobka''.&lt;ref&gt;Herşcovici, Lucian-Zeev (August 16, 2010). "[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Iasi Iaşi]." Translated from Romanian by Anca Mircea. ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''. Retrieved 2016-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==

In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Germany]] appears to have had a "kosher meat tax" imposed by municipalities and used to support the local Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6664">[[File:Soy-whey-protein-diet.jpg|thumb|Lacto-vegetarians consume dairy products, but not eggs or meat.]]
A '''lac to vegetarian''' (sometimes referred to as a '''lactarian'''; from the [[Latin]] root '''lact-''', ''milk'') diet is a  diet that includes vegetables as well as [[dairy product]]s such as [[milk]], [[cheese]], [[yogurt]], [[butter]], [[ghee]], [[cream]], and [[kefir]], but excludes [[egg (food)|eggs]]. 

In India, lacto vegetarian is considered synonymous to vegetarian, while eating eggs is considered a form of non-vegetarian diet. The concept and practice of lacto-vegetarianism among a significant number of people comes from [[ancient India]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Colin: ''The Heretic’s Feast. A History of Vegetarianism'', London: Fourth Estate 1993, p. 69–84. {{ISBN|1-85702-078-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In other parts of the world, vegetarianism generally refers to [[ovo lacto vegetarianism]] instead, allowing eggs into the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/becoming-a-vegetarian|title=Becoming a vegetarian|date=Oct 2009|access-date=18 Nov 2017|website=Harvard Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{See also|Ahimsa|Ethical vegetarian|Environmental vegetarianism}}

Lacto-vegetarian diets are popular with many followers of the [[Eastern religion|Eastern]] religious traditions such as  [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Sikhism]]. The cores of their beliefs behind a lacto-vegetarian diet is the law of [[ahimsa]], or non-violence.&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 50-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
According to the [[Vedas]], (Hindu holy scriptures), all living beings are equally valued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/5/18/en1 Bhagavad Gita 5.18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917212912/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/5/18/en1 |date=2009-09-17 }} "The humble sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hinduwebsite.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/essays/animals.asp |title=Animals in Hinduism, second paragraph |publisher=Hinduwebsite.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism also adopted much of the buddhist philosophy on nonviolence.&lt;ref name="Sabate2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan Sabate|title=Vegetarian Nutrition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_XKBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP10|date=21 March 2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-3683-1|page=518}}&lt;/ref&gt;Also, Hindus believe that one's personality is affected by the kind of food one consumes, and eating flesh is considered bad for one's spiritual/mental well-being.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=September 2018}} It takes many more vegetables or plants to produce an equal amount of meat,&lt;ref name=feed800&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Aug97/livestock.hrs.html |title=U.S. could feed 800 million people with grain that livestock eat |publisher=News.cornell.edu |date=1997-08-07 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; many more lives are destroyed, and in this way more suffering is caused when meat is consumed.&lt;ref name=Gabriel001&gt;Gabriel Cousens, Spiritual Nutrition: Six Foundations for Spiritual Life and the Awakening of Kundalini, North Athlantic Books, page 251&lt;/ref&gt; Although some suffering and pain is inevitably caused to other living beings to satisfy the human need for food, according to ahimsa, every effort should be made to minimize suffering.&lt;ref name=Gabriel001/&gt; This is to avoid [[Karma|karmic consequences]] and show respect for living things.Because all living beings are equally valued in these traditions,&lt;ref name="hinduwebsite.com"/&gt; a vegetarian diet rooted in [[ahimsa]] is only one aspect of environmentally conscious living, relating to those beings affected by our need for food.&lt;ref name=Gabriel001/&gt; Environmentalism and vegetarianism are often practiced together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tue, Mar 24, 2009 at 05:37 PM |url=http://www.mnn.com/technology/research-innovations/stories/stuff-environmentalists-like |title=Many environmentalists are vegetarian |publisher=Mnn.com |date=2009-03-24 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mia MacDonald |url=http://www.miamacdonald.com/a.php?id=27 |title=Maneka Gandhi and Ahimsa |publisher=Miamacdonald.com |date=1969-12-31 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;\

===Jainism===
In the case of [[Jainism]], the vegetarian standards are strict. It allows the consumption of only fruit and leaves that can be taken from plants without causing their death. This further excludes from the diet vegetables like [[carrots]], [[potatoes]],  [[onions]] and [[garlic]].

==Lacto-vegetarians and vegans==

The primary difference between a [[veganism|vegan]] and a lacto-vegetarian diet is the avoidance of dairy products. Vegans do not consume dairy because of their belief that their production causes the animal suffering or a premature death,&lt;ref name=marcus&gt;{{cite book|title=Vegan: The New Ethics of Eating|author=Erik Marcus|date=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hHjqs43t8oC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise abridges [[animal rights]].

The '''Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill 2012''' is a [[Bill (legislation)|Bill]] of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]]. It is an amendment to the Legislative Council Ordinance {{Cite Hong Kong ordinance|542|39}} to disqualify a resigned member of the Legislative Council from participating in a subsequent [[by-election]]. The original proposal was to avoid by-elections but it sparked vast controversies in the community. The revised Bill restricts a resigned member of the Legislative Council from standing in any by-elections within six months.

==Background==
{{main|Hong Kong by-election, 2010}}
In January 2010, five [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pro-democracy]] Legislative Council members from each of the five [[geographical constituencies]] resigned to trigger territory-wide by-elections for the purpose of instigating a so-called “referendum”. They stood in the by-elections and were all re-elected. The 2010 by-election launched by the pro-democracy legislators was strongly criticised by the Beijing government. As government claimed that "views received during the public consultation on the arrangements for filling vacancies in the LegCo indicate that more people consider that the phenomenon of Members resigning at will, triggering by-elections in which they seek to stand, is a mischief that needs to be addressed,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill 2012|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201202/01/P201202010330.htm|date=1 February 2012|accessdate=2 May 2013|agency=Hong Kong SAR Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government therefore tried to change the electoral system to plug the "loophole".

==Proposal==
In mid-May 2011, the government revealed its plan to do away with by-elections entirely. Unveiling the proposal, [[Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau|Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs]] [[Stephen Lam]] cited the practice elsewhere: "In some countries where the proportional representation (PR) system is adopted, by-elections are not used to fill vacant seats arising mid-term." According to the plan published on 8 June 2011, a Legislative Council seat in any geographical constituency or one of the five newly created [[District Council (Second)|district council 'superconstituencies']] vacated by the resignation or death of a legislator would be filled by a 'leapfrog' mechanism by the next best placed candidate at the previous election.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Gary (18 May 2011). "By-elections given a no-vote". ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

The consultation document was opposed by the pro-democracy camp, professionals and legal experts. The government tabled a bill to amend current legislation for by-elections for 13 July 2011.&lt;ref name=20110701SCMP&gt;Fung, Wai-yee Fanny (1 July 2011). "Majority oppose polls-axe bid". ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; However, by late June, the bill's future looked in doubt when the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Central Government Liaison Office]] suggested a re-think. On 28 June, the government revised its proposal stipulating replacement by an unsuccessful candidate on the same election ticket.&lt;ref name=20110701SCMP/&gt; Whilst pro-government legislators declared support for the revised plan in principle, [[Regina Ip]] stated that consultation would still be desirable.&lt;ref&gt;TV news broadcasts.&lt;/ref&gt; The government bowed to pressure and announced one week later that it would suspend reading of the bill for two months, pending consultations on the revised proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Colleen; Wong, Natalie (5 July 2011). [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=112760&amp;sid=32936962&amp;con_type=1 "U-turn"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016014831/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=112760&amp;sid=32936962&amp;con_type=1 |date=2012-10-16 }}. ''The Standard'' (Hong Kong)&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the Government published a consultation paper in which four options were proposed with regard to the arrangements for filling vacancies in the Legislative Council. Options to fill a casual vacancy arising mid-term in the Legislative Council:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Consultation Paper on Arrangements for Filling Vacancies in the Legislative Council|url=http://www.cmab.gov.hk/doc/en/documents/filling_vacancies/Consultation_Paper_with_Annexes_en.pdf|work=Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau|date=July 2011|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# restricting resigning Members from participating in any by-election in the same term,
# a replacement mechanism using the same candidate list followed by a precedence list system (the Administration’s revised proposal),
# a replacement mechanism which does not cover causal vacancies arising from death, serious illness or other involuntary circumstances; and 
# a replacement mechanism using the same candidate list, followed by leaving the seat vacant when the list is exhausted.

After the consultation, the government modified the bill to bar the resigning legislator from running again for six months.

==Criticisms==
The original proposal attracted criticism from Pan-Democrats as it was seen as depriving citizens of their political rights; even pro-government figures in the legislature expressed reservations about the workability of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Fung, Wai-yee Fanny (19 May 2011). "Plan to scrap by-elections criticised". ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The pan democrats remained in opposition to any restriction of the electoral system.

A researcher in Britain's [[Electoral Reform Society]] said it was indeed common for vacancies to be filled by a candidate who was next-in-line, but one who was on the specific list of the outgoing. He said that the proposal meant that a seat held by a small party (without a list) would automatically go to another party if its representative resigned or died, thereby entirely losing representation.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Gary (20 May 2011). "Legco vacancy scheme questioned". ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hong Kong Bar Association]] four strongly worded public warnings within two weeks of the first announcement of the plan, stating that the government's change violated the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and [[Hong Kong Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HKBA's Submission on the Proposed Replacement Arrangement in the Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill 2011 - Press Release|date=17 June 2011|accessdate=2 May 2013|work=Hong Kong Bar Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bar Association also opposed the revised proposal as its violation to the right to stand for election and right to elect guaranteed in the Article 26 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consultation Paper on Arrangements for Filling Vacancies in the Legislative Council (July 2011) Response of the Hong Kong Bar Association|url=http://www.hkba.org/whatsnew/press-release/20110831e.pdf|work=Hong Kong Bar Association|date=31 August 2011|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics echoed the sentiments, and also brought to light the possibility, albeit slim, that the new mechanism may abet assassinations.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Gary (7 June 2011). "Academic says proposal could abet assassinations". ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Chan]] and [[Wong Yuk-man]] of [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]] start the [[filibuster]] by submitting 1306 amendments altogether to the revised Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill. Leung Kwok-hung of the League of Social Democrats and Andrew Cheng also participated in the filibustering. [[Miriam Lau]] of the [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] carried out a 30-hour hunger strike to voice her opposition against such act of [[obstructionism]] and waste of public coffers. The Legislative Council carried on multiple overnight debates on the amendments with the support of the pro-Beijing camp. 

On morning of 17 May 2012, [[Jasper Tsang Yok-sing]], President of the Legco adopt Article 92 of the Standing Order, which allows the president follow foreign parliament rules for unregulated behaviors to terminate the debate. In the end, all amendments were defeated and the Bill was passed on 1 June 2012.

It was opened on April 24, 2009, as the '''Marcus Nanotechnology Research Center''', a name it held until October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite pressrelease|url=http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?id=2829 |title=Marcus Nanotechnology Building Formally Dedicated |publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]] |date=2009-04-23 |accessdate=2009-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707074834/http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?id=2829 |archivedate=2009-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | work=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] | url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/atlanta/stories/2009/04/24/nanotechnology_georgia_tech.html | title=Nanotechnology building opens at Georgia Tech | date=2009-04-29 | accessdate=2009-08-09 | last=Markiewicz | first=David }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The Marcus Nanotechnology Building (MNB) is now the headquarters for the [[Institute of Electronics and Nanotechnology]] (IEN), one of Georgia Tech's several new Interdisciplinary Research Institutes (IRI). In addition to being the headquarters for the IEN, the building houses the largest [[cleanroom]] laboratory dedicated to the fabrication, characterization, and assembly of biomedical and semiconductor devices in the [[Southeast United States]].

These shared-user open laboratories are part of the National Science Foundation's [[National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network]] (NNIN), a network of 14 such facilities at universities around the US. The laboratories are available to global academics, industry and government personnel on a fee recovery basis enabling students, scientists and engineers who perform research on nanotechnology to study the characteristics and behavior of atoms and molecules, and to use that knowledge to create new materials and tiny [[nanometer|nano]]-scale tools and machines.

==Status==
The [[GTRI Information and Communications Laboratory|Information and Communications Laboratory]] was previously located on the site, and has been moved to [http://gtalumni.org/campusmap/bldngmodel.php?id=141 GCATT]. The Electronics Research Building, established in 1966,&lt;ref name="timeline1960s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/timeline/1960s.html |title=Tech Timeline: 1960s |publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association |accessdate=2007-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027074039/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/timeline/1960s.html |archivedate=October 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was demolished, and construction began in Fall 2006/Spring 2007.

The '''Ministry of Justice and Public Order of the Republic of Cyprus'''  ({{lang-el|Υπουργείο Δικαιοσύνης και Δημοσίας Τάξεως της Κυπριακής Δημοκρατίας}}, {{lang-tr|Kıbrıs Cumhuriyeti Adalet ve Kamu Düzeni Bakanlığı}}) is one of the eleven Ministries of the [[Republic of Cyprus]]&lt;ref name="MinistriesPortal"&gt;Cyprus Government Web Portal{{cite web | title = Ministries and Council of Ministers | url = http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/portal/portal.nsf/All/E3E3F625C4F70D66C2256FC00033B3A7?OpenDocument | accessdate = 16 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the Ministry responsible for the close review and consideration of the need to reform the existing legislation in a wide field of public and private law, such as criminal law, legislation that falls within the general concept of the administration of justice, family law, legislation in the fields of equality, human rights, the treatment of offenders and other.&lt;ref name="MinistryWebPortal"&gt;Cyprus Government Web Portal{{cite web | title = Executive Power - Ministries and Council of Ministers - Ministry of Justice and Public Order | url = http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/portal/portal.nsf/All/5CD0343628CE0074C22571F10033B184?OpenDocument | accessdate = 16 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;Ministry of Justice and Public Order Official Website {{cite web | title = MISSION | url = http://www.mjpo.gov.cy/mjpo/mjpo.nsf/dmlmission_en/dmlmission_en?OpenDocument | accessdate = 16 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Ministry of Justice and Public Order fall agencies like the [[Cyprus Police]] and the [[Cyprus Prisons Department]].

==History==
The Ministry of Justice immediately after the independence (from the 1959 interim period to 1982) was hosted in the Government Buildings in Demosthenes Severis Avenue known as Chief Colonial Secretary Office.

In 1982 the Ministry moved to Grivas Dighenis Avenue in a building opposite the Kykkos monastery dependency at Engomi, Nicosia where it remained up to 1993.

After the renaming of the Ministry to Ministry of Justice and Public Order in 1993 it has moved to Heliopouleos Street in the building known as the "Ellinas Clinic" where it remained up to the year 2000. Since then it has moved to 125 Athalassas Avenue, Strovolos, Nicosia.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;Ministry of Justice and Public Order Official Website {{cite web | title = Historical Background | url = http://www.mjpo.gov.cy/mjpo/mjpo.nsf/dmlhistory_en/dmlhistory_en?OpenDocument | accessdate = 16 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34123">{{for|the documentary|Miss Representation}}
A concept of [[English law]], a '''misrepresentation'''  is an untrue or misleading&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Royal Mail Case|R v Kylsant]]'' [1931]&lt;/ref&gt;  statement of fact made during negotiations by one party to another, the statement  then inducing that other party into the contract.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co]]''[1951] Ms Curtis took a wedding dress with beads and sequins to the cleaners. They gave her a contract to sign and she asked the assistant what it was. The assistant said it merely covered risk to the beads, but in fact the contract exempted all liability. The dress was stained but the exclusion was ineffective because of the assistant's misrepresentation, and the claim was allowed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co]]'' [1951] 1 KB 805&lt;/ref&gt; The misled party may normally [[Rescission (contract law)|rescind]] the contract, and sometimes may be awarded damages as well (or instead of rescission).

The law of misrepresentation is an amalgam of contract and tort; and its sources are [[common law]], [[Equity (law)|equity]] and [[statute]]. The common law was amended by the [[Misrepresentation Act 1967]]. The general principle of misrepresentation has been adopted by the USA and various Commonwealth countries.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Misrepresentation in India]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation and contract terms==
A "representation" is a pre-contractual statement made during negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;For the purposes of "offer and acceptance", a representation may serve a further function such as an "offer", "counter-offer", "invitation to treat", "request for information" or "statement of intention"&lt;/ref&gt; If a representation has been incorporated into the contract as a [[Contractual term|term]],&lt;ref&gt;A contractual term may be a [[warranty]], [[Contractual term#Condition or Warranty|condition]] or innominate term.&lt;/ref&gt; then the normal remedies for [[breach of contract]] apply. Factors that determine whether or not a representation has become a term include:
* The relative expertise of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oscar Chess v Williams (1957) ]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dick Bentley v Harold Smith Motors ]]'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The reliance that one party has shown on the statement.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bannerman v White]]'' (1861).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The reassurances given by the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Schawel v Reade]]'' (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The customary norms of the trade in question.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ecay v Godfrey]]'' (1947)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The representation forms the basis of a [[collateral contract]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Andrews v Hopkinson]]'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shanklin Pier v Detel Products]]'' (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Evans v Andrea Merzario]]'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Heilbut, Symons &amp; Co. v Buckleton]]'' [1913] A.C. 30 HL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer'' [1919]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|64|1919|ltigants=Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer |parallecite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1919/64.pdf (1919) 27 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 133 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise, an action may lie in misrepresentation, and perhaps in the torts of [[negligence]] and [[deceit]] also.  Although a suit for breach of contract is relatively straightforward, there are advantages in bringing a parallel suit in misrepresentation, because whereas repudiation is available only for breach of condition&lt;ref&gt;A "condition" is a term whose breach denies the main benefit of the contract to the claimant.&lt;/ref&gt; only, rescission is ''[[prima facie]]'' available for all misreps, subject to the provisions of s.2 of the [[Misrepresentation Act 1967]], and subject to the inherent limitations of an equitable remedy.&lt;ref&gt;"Inherent limitations": equitable remedies are only ever discretionary; and one must "come to equity with clean hands".&lt;/ref&gt;

== No general duty of disclosure==
There is no general duty of disclosure in English contract law, and one is normally not obliged to say anything.&lt;ref&gt;However, [[EU Law]] has introduced a "right of reasonable expectation". - ''[[Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA|Marleasing]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary contracts do not require "good faith" as such,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mayerbrown.com/files/Publication/92d74f21-c4e3-4d1d-86ac-77fa21b6c95c/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/65ac405d-db68-4d53-bdfa-8434e78cf627/Good_Faith_jul2013_corp-alert.pdf "Good faith in English contract law?"]&lt;/ref&gt; and mere compliance with the law is sufficient. However in particular relationships silence may form the basis of an actionable misrepresentation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|64|1984|litigants= [[Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corp]] |parallelcite=(1984) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 41 at [68]|courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Davies v. London &amp; Provincial Marine Insurance Co]]'' (1878) 8 Ch. D. 469, 474. Justice Fry commented on the responsibilities of a fiduciary "...they can only contract after the most ample disclosure of everything..."&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Agency (law)|Agents]] have a [[fiduciary|fiduciary relationship]] with their principal. They must make proper disclosure and must not make secret profits.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lowther v Lord Lowther]]'' (1806) 13 Ves Jr 95, the plaintiff handed over a picture to an agent for sale. The agent knew of the picture's true worth yet bought it for a considerably lower price. The plaintiff subsequently discovered the picture's true worth and sued to rescind the contract. It was held that the defendant was in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff and accordingly assumed an obligation to disclose all material facts. Accordingly, the contract could be rescinded.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Employers and employees have a ''[[Ex fida bona|bona fide]]'' duty to each other once a [[contract of employment]] has begun; but a job applicant owes no duty of disclosure in a job interview.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Fletcher v Krell'' (1873) 2 LJ (QB) 55, a woman who was appointed to the post of governess failed to reveal that she had previously been married. (The employer favoured single women).  It was held that she had made no misrepresentation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Spice Girls v Aprilia World Service'' CHD 24 FEB 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://swarb.co.uk/spice-girls-ltd-v-aprilia-world-service-bv-chd-24-feb-2000/&lt;/ref&gt;
* A contract ''[[uberrima fides|uberrimae fidei]]'' is a contract of 'utmost good faith', and include contracts of insurance, business partnerships, and family agreements.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gordon v Gordon]]'' (1821) 3 Swan 400, two brothers had reached an agreement regarding the family estate. The elder brother was under the impression that he was born out of wedlock and thus not their father's true heir. The agreement was reached on this basis. The elder brother subsequently discovered that this was not the case and that the younger brother had knowledge of this during the negotiation of the settlement. The elder brother sued to set aside the agreement and was successful on the grounds that such a contract was one of uberrimae fidei and the required disclosure had not been executed.&lt;/ref&gt; When applying for insurance, the proposer must disclose all material facts for the insurer properly to assess the risk.&lt;ref&gt;In insurance the insurer agrees to indemnify the assured against losses proximately caused by insured perils, and the insurer is thus entitled to know full details of the risk being transferred to him.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lord Blackburn addressed the issue in ''[[Brownlie v Campbell]]'' (1880) 5 App Cas 925 when he noted "...the concealment of a material circumstance known to you...avoids the policy."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the 1908 case of ''[[Joel v Law Union]]''  [1908] KB 884 the ''de minimis'' rule was applied in a life assurance  policy. Despite minor omissions, the assured had made a sufficiently substantial disclosure of material facts that the insurer knew the risk, and the policy was valid&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''lex non curat de minimis''  - the law does not concern itself with trifles&lt;/ref&gt; The duty of disclosure in insurance has been substantially amended by the [[Insurance Act 2015]].

==The "untrue statement"==
{{Clist misrepresentation}}
To amount to a misrepresentation, the statement must be untrue or seriously misleading.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A statement which is "technically true" but which gives a misleading impression is deemed an "untrue statement".&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Ltd]]'', Krakowski agreed to enter into a contract to buy a shop premises from Eurolynx as long as a 'strong tenant' had been organised. The contract proceeded on the grounds that such a tenant had been arranged. Unbeknown to Krakowski, Eurolynx had entered into an additional agreement with the tenant to provide funds for the first three months rent to ensure the contract went ahead. When the tenant defaulted on the rent and subsequently vacated the premises, Krakowski found out about the additional agreement and rescinded the contract with Eurolynx. It was held that Eurolynx's failure to disclose all material facts about the 'strong tenant' was enough to constitute a misrepresentation and the contract could be rescinded on these grounds.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krakowski v Eurolynx"/&gt; If a misstatement is made and later the representor finds that it is false, it becomes fraudulent unless the representer updates the other party.&lt;ref&gt;''Lockhart v. Osman'' [1981] VR 57, an agent had advertised some cattle as being “well-suited for breeding purposes”. Later on, it was discovered that the stock had been exposed to a contagious disease which affected the reproductive system. It was held that the agent had a duty to take remedial action and correct the representation. The failure by the agent to take such measures resulted in the contract being set aside.&lt;/ref&gt; If the statement is true at the time, but becomes untrue due to a change in circumstances, the representor must update the original statement.&lt;ref&gt;''[[With v O’Flanagan]]'' [1936] Ch. 575, the plaintiff entered into a contract to purchase O’Flanagan’s medical practice. During negotiations it was said that the practice produced an income of £2000 per year. Before the contract was signed, the practice took a downward turn and lost a significant amount of value. After the contract had been entered into, the true nature of the practice was discovered and the plaintiff took action in misrepresentation. In his decision, Lord Wright said, "...a representation made as a matter of inducement to enter into a contract is to be treated as a continuing representation.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[With v O’Flanagan]]'' [1936] Ch. 575, 584.&lt;/ref&gt; Actionable misrepresentations must be misstatements of fact or law:&lt;ref&gt;Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council [1999] 2 AC 349, abolished a bar on mistake of law bar and Pankhania v Hackney LBC [2002] EWHC 2441 (Ch) held the same went for misrepresentation under Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1) where agents of a land seller incorrectly said that people running a car park on some property were licensees rather than protected business tenants&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick v Michel"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWStRp|19|1928|litigants=Fitzpatrick v Michel |parallecite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; misstatements of opinion&lt;ref&gt;''Bisset v Wilkinson'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 177 PC&lt;/ref&gt; or intention are not deemed statements of fact;&lt;ref name="Opinion and intention"&gt;See ''[[Achut v Achuthan]]'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krakowski v Eurolynx"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|68|1995|litigants=Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Ltd |parallelcite=(1995) 183  [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 563 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but if one party appears to have specialist knowledge of the topic, his  "opinions" may be considered actionable misstatements of fact.&lt;ref name="Opinion as fact"&gt;See ''[[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon]]'' [1976] 2 Lloyd's Rep 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Smith v Land &amp; House Property '' (1884) 28 Ch D 7 CA&lt;/ref&gt; For example, false statements made by a seller regarding the quality or nature of the property that the seller has may constitute misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Smith v Land &amp; House Property]]'' (1884) 28 Ch D 7 CA&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Statements of opinion'''
Statements of opinion are usually insufficient to amount to a misrepresentation&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick v Michel"/&gt; as it would be unreasonable to treat personal opinions as "facts", as in ''[[Bisset v Wilkinson]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bisset v Wilkinson]]'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions can arise where opinions may be treated as "facts":
* where an opinion is expressed yet this opinion is not actually held by the representor,&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick v Michel"/&gt;
* where it is implied that the representor has facts on which to base the opinion,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Smith v Land &amp; House Property Corp]]'' (1884) 28 Ch. D. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* where one party should have known facts on which such an opinion would be based.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Esso Petroleum v Mardon]]'' [1976] QB 801.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Statements of intention'''
Statements of intention do not constitute misrepresentations should they fail to come to fruition, since the time the statements were made they can not be deemed either true or false. However,  an action can be brought if the intention never actually existed, as in ''[[Edgington v Fitzmaurice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Edgington v Fitzmaurice]]'' (1885) 29 Ch. D. 459, company directors seeking a loan "intended to develop the business" always intended to use the cash to repay debts. The state of mind is an existing fact, therefore, a false presentation of an existing fact, so that the contract was voidable.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Statements of law'''
For many years, statements of law were deemed incapable of amounting to misrepresentations because the law is "equally accessible by both parties" and is "...as much the business of the plaintiff as of [the defendants] to know what the law [is].".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Beattie v Lord Ebury]]'' (1872) LR 7 Ch App 777, 803.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has changed, and it is now accepted that statements of law may be treated as akin to statements of fact.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{Cite AustLII|HCA|48|1992|litigants=[[David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia]] |parallelcite=(1992) 175 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 353 |courtname=auto |date=}}; see also {{Cite AustLII|VicRp|31|1978|litigants=Public Trustee v Taylor |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}. While dealing with a mistake of law, similar reasoning should apply to a misrepresentation of law.&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by Lord Denning "...the distinction between law and fact is illusory".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Andre &amp; Cie v Ets Michel Blanc &amp; Fils]]'' [1979] 2 Lloyds LR 427, 430.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Statement to the misled'''
An action in misrepresentation can only be brought by the misled party, or "represent". This means that only those who were an intended recipient of the representation may sue, as in ''[[Peek v Gurney]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peek v Gurney]]'' (1873) LR 6 HL 377, where the plaintiff sued the directors of a company for indemnity. The action failed because it was found that the plaintiff was not a represent (an intended party to the representation) and accordingly misrepresentation could not be a protection.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary for the representation to have been be received directly; it is sufficient that the representation was made to another party with the intention that it would become known to a subsequent party and ultimately acted upon by them.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1972|litigants=[[Commercial Banking Co (Sydney) Ltd v R H Brown &amp; Co]] |parallelcite=(1972) 126 [[Commonwelath Law Reports|CLR]] 337 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it IS essential that the untruth originates from the defendant.

===Inducement===
The misled party must show that he relied on the misstatement and was induced into the contract by it.

In ''[[Attwood v Small]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1838) 6 Cl&amp;F 232&lt;/ref&gt; The seller, Small, made false claims about the capabilities of his mines and steelworks. The buyer, Attwood, said he would verify the claims before he bought, and he employed agents who declared that Small's claims were true. The House of Lords held that Attwood could not rescind the contract, as he did not rely on Small but instead relied on his agents. ''[[Edgington v Fitzmaurice]]''&lt;ref name="1885 29 Ch D 459"&gt;(1885) 29 Ch D 459&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed further that a misrepresentation need not be the sole cause of entering a contract, for a remedy to be available, so long as it is an influence.&lt;ref&gt;A Burrows, ''A Casebook on Contract'' (Hart, Oxford 2007) 355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Standard Chartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping Corp (No 2)]]'' [2002] UKHL 43, damages for deceit cannot be reduced for contributory negligence.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gran Gelato Ltd v Richcliff (Group) Ltd]]'' [1992] QB 560&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see ''[[Smith v Hughes]]'' (1871) LR 6 QB 597&lt;/ref&gt;

A party induced by a misrepresentation is not obliged to check its veracity. In ''[[Redgrave v Hurd]]'' &lt;ref&gt;(1881) 20 Ch D 1&lt;/ref&gt; Redgrave, an elderly solicitor told Hurd, a potential buyer, that the practice earned £300 pa. Redgrave said  Hurd could inspect the accounts to check the claim, but Hurd did not do so. Later, having signed a contract to join Redgrave as a partner, Hurd discovered the practice generated only £200 pa, and the accounts verified this figure. [[Lord Jessel]] [[Master of the Rolles|MR]] held that the contract could be rescinded for misrepresentation, because Redgrave had made a misrepresentation, adding that Hurd was entitled to rely on the £300 statement.&lt;ref&gt;The case also makes clear that, the circumstances having altered, Redgrave was under a duty to inform the Hurd of the changes.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in ''[[Leaf v International Galleries]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Leaf v International Galleries'' [1950] 2 KB 86&lt;/ref&gt; where a gallery sold painting after wrongly saying it was a [[John Constable|Constable]], [[Lord Denning]] held that while there was neither breach of contract nor operative mistake, there WAS a misrepresentation; but, five years having passed, the buyer's right to rescind had lapsed. This suggests that, having relied on a misrepresentation, the misled party has the onus to discover the truth "within a reasonable time". In ''[[Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd|Doyle v Olby]]'' [1969],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd|Doyle v Olby]]''1969 2 QB 158 CA&lt;/ref&gt; a party misled by a fraudulent misrepresentation was deemed NOT to have affirmed even after more than a year.

==Fraudulent, negligent and innocent misrepresentation==
[[File:Misrep chart.jpg|thumb|A chart of the 3 types of misrepresentation, with definitions &amp; remedies]]
The common law was amended by the [[Misrepresentation Act 1967]]. (Although short and apparently succinct, the 1967 Act is widely regarded as a confusing and poorly drafted statute which has caused a number of difficulties, especially in relation to the basis of the award of damages.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson]]'' [1991] 2 QB 297&lt;/ref&gt; It was mildly amended by the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] and in 2012, but it escaped the attention of the consolidating [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]]).

Prior to the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the common law deemed that there were two categories of misrepresentation: fraudulent and innocent. The effect of the act is primarily to create a new category by dividing innocent misrepresentation into two separate categories: negligent and "wholly" innocent; and it goes on to state the remedies in respect of each of the three categories.&lt;ref&gt;Nowhere in the 1967 Act are the words "negligent misrepresentation" to be found; that terminology was established by practising and academic lawyers.&lt;/ref&gt; The point of the three categories is that the law recognises that the defendant may have been blameworthy to a greater or lesser extent; and the relative degrees of blameworthiness lead to differing remedies for the claimant.

Once misrepresentation has been proven, it is presumed to be "negligent misrepresentation", the default category.  It then falls to the claimant to prove that the defendant's culpability was more serious and that the misrepresentation was fraudulent. Conversely, the defendant may try to show that his misrepresentation was innocent.

* '''Negligent misrepresentation''' is simply the '''default category'''.&lt;ref&gt;There is no specific relationship between negligent misrepresentation and the tort of negligence and the duty of care under ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' or ''[[Hedley Byrne v Heller]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
::'''Remedy: '''The misled party may rescind and claim damages under s.2(1) for any losses. The court may "declare the contract subsisting" and award damages in lieu of rescission, but s.2(3) prevents the award of double damages.

* '''Fraudulent misrepresentation''' is defined is the 3-part test in ''[[Derry v Peek]]'', where the defendant is fraudulent if he:
:(i) knows the statement to be false,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Royal Mail Case|R v Kylsant]]''&lt;/ref&gt; or 
:(ii) does not believe in the statement,&lt;ref&gt;A defendant honestly believing his statement to be true is not fraudulent: "Honesty of belief in the truth of a warranty is no defence to a breach of warranty, whereas it is a complete defence to a charge of false representation. If a statement is an honest expression of opinion, honestly entertained, it cannot be said that it involves a fraudulent misrepresentation of fact."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick v Michel"/&gt; or 
:(iii) is [[Recklessness (law)|reckless]] as to its truth.

::'''Remedy''': The misled party may rescind and claim damages for all directly consequential losses. ''[[Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd|Doyle v Olby]]'' [1969]

* '''Innocent misrepresentation''' is "belief on reasonable grounds up till the time of the contract that the facts represented are true". (s.2(1)of the Act).

::'''Remedy''': The misled party may rescind but has no entitlement to damages under s.2(1). However, the court may "declare the contract subsisting" and award damages in lieu of rescission.&lt;ref&gt;The victim of an innocent misrepresentation who wishes to affirm the contract has no legal right to damages. Of course, the misled party may seek to negotiate a compensation payment, but the other party need not comply; and if the misled party litigates to seek "damages in lieu", but the court holds that the contract must subsist, the misled party will lose the case and be liable for costs.&lt;/ref&gt; (By contrast, the victim of a breach of warranty in contract may claim damages for loss, but may not repudiate)&lt;ref&gt;[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd|''Hong Kong Fir Shipping v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negligent misstatement==
'''Negligent misstatement''' is not strictly part of the law of misrepresentation, but is a [[tort]] based upon the 1964 ''[[obiter dicta]]'' in ''[[Hedley Byrne v Heller]]'' &lt;ref&gt;''[[Hedley Byrne v Heller]]'' [1964] A.C. 465&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[Judicial functions of the House of lords|House of Lords]] found that a negligently-made statement (if relied upon) could be actionable provided a "special relationship" existed between the parties.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Hedley Byrne v Heller'', the "special relationship" was between one bank who gave a financial reference to another bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently in ''[[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon]]'' [1976] Q.B. 801&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lord Denning]] transported this tort into [[contract law]], stating the rule as:

''...if a man, who has or professes to have special knowledge or skill, makes a representation by virtue thereof to another…with the intention of inducing him to enter into a contract with him, he is under a duty to use reasonable care to see that the representation is correct, and that the advice, information or opinion is reliable'.

==Remedies==
The misled party may normally rescind the contract, and sometimes may be awarded damages as well (or instead of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]]).

===Rescission===
{{main|Rescission (contract law)}}
A contract vitiated by misrepresentation is [[voidable]] and not [[void (law)|void ''ab initio'']]. The misled party may either (i) rescind, or (ii) affirm and continue to be bound. If the claimant chooses to rescind, the contract will still be deemed to have been valid up to the time it was avoided, so any transactions with a third party remains valid, and the third party will retain [[legal title|good title]].&lt;ref name="shogun"&gt;For legal reasoning application of the difference see ''[[Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson]]'' [2004] 1 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 919; Brooks, O &amp; Dodd, A ‘Shogun: A Principled Decision’ (2003) 153 ''NLJ'' 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Rescission can be effected either by informing the representor or by requesting an order from the court. Rescission is an equitable remedy which is not always available.&lt;ref&gt;"He who comes to equity must come with clean hands".&lt;/ref&gt; Rescission requires the parties to be restored to their former positions; so if this is not possible, rescission is unavailable.&lt;ref name="Impossibility"&gt;See ''[[Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co]]'' (1878) 3 App. Cas. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

A misled party who, knowing of the misrepresentation, fails to take steps to avoid the contract will be deemed to have '''affirmed''' through "[[Laches (equity)|laches]]", as in ''[[Leaf v International Galleries]]'';&lt;ref&gt;''[[Leaf v International Galleries]]'' 1950] 2 KB 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Affirmation"&gt;See ''[[Long v. Lloyd]]'' [1958] 1 WLR 753. See also {{Cite AustLII|HCA|64|1955|litigants=Alati v Kruger |paralleicte=(1955) 94 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 216 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;in ''Long v Lloyd''  Mr Long bought from Mr Lloyd a lorry advertised as being in ‘exceptional condition,’ said to do 40 mph and 11 miles to the gallon. When it broke down after two days and was doing 5 miles to the gallon, Mr Long complained. Mr Lloyd said he would repair it for half the price of a reconstructed dynamo. Because Mr Long accepted this, when it broke down again, Pearce LJ held the contract had been affirmed. It was too late to escape for misrepresentation. A more lenient approach may now exist. As Slade LJ pointed out in Peyman v Lanjani,[42] actual knowledge of the right to choose to affirm a contract or rescind is essential before one can be said to have "affirmed" a contract.&lt;/ref&gt; and the claimant will be estopped from rescinding. The time limit for taking such steps varies depending on the type of misrepresentation. In cases of fraudulent misrepresentation, the time limit runs until when the misrepresentation ought to have been discovered, whereas in innocent misrepresentation, the right to rescission may lapse even before the represent can reasonably be expected to know about it.&lt;ref name="Lapse"&gt;See ''[[Leaf v International Galleries]]'' [1950] 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, third party rights may intervene and render rescission impossible. Say, if A misleads B and contracts to sell a house to him, and B later sells to C, the courts are unlikely to permit rescission as that would unfair impinge upon C.

Under [[Misrepresentations Act 1967]] s. 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the [[court]] has discretion to award damages instead of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]], "if of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other party."

===Damages===
{{main| Damages}}
"Damages" are monetary compensation for loss. In contract&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and tort,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd|The Wagon Mound]]''&lt;/ref&gt; damages will be awarded if the breach of contract (or breach of duty) causes '''foreseeable''' loss.

* By contrast, a fraudulent misrepresentor is liable in the common law tort of [[deceit]] for all direct consequences, whether or not the losses were foreseeable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd]]'' [1969] 2 QB 158]&lt;/ref&gt;
*For negligent misrepresentation, the claimant may get damages as of right under s.2(1) and/or damages in lieu of rescission under s.2(2).
* For innocent misrepresentation, the claimant may get only damages in lieu of rescission under s.2(2).

Given the relative lack of blameworthiness of a non-fraudulent defendant (who is at worst merely careless, and at best may honestly "believe on reasonable grounds" that he told the truth) for many years lawyers presumed that for these two categories, damages would be on a contract/tort basis requiring reasonable foreseeability of loss.

In 1991, ''[[Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Royscott Trust v Rogerson'' [1991] 3 All ER 294 CA&lt;/ref&gt; changed all that. The court gave a [[statutory interpretation|literal interpretation]] of s.2 (which, to paraphrase, provides  that where a person has been misled by a negligent misrepresentation  then, if the misrepresentor would be liable to damages had the representation been made fraudulently, the defendant "shall be so liable"). The phrase '''shall be so liable''' was read literally to mean "liable as in fraudulent misrepresentation". So, under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, damages for negligent misrepresentation are calculated as if the defendant had been fraudulent, even if he has been merely careless.&lt;ref&gt;''Royscott Trust v Rogerson'' is arguably ''[[Mechanisms of the English common law|per incuriam]]'' as the court failed to pay attention to the definition of fraudulent misrep in ''[[Derry v Peek]]''. Had the court done so, it would have held that the misrep in this case was fraudulent rather than negligent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this was almost certainly not the intention of Parliament, no changes to the law have been made to address this discrepancy.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]] left the 1967 Act intact.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is known as the fiction of fraud and also extends to tortious liability.&lt;ref&gt;Tortious liability has a wider scope than usual contractual liability, as it allows the claimant to claim for loss even if it is not reasonably foreseeable,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} which is not possible with a claim for breach of contract due to the decision in Hadley v Baxendale. Inclusion of the representation into the contract as a [[Contractual term|term]] will leave the remedy for breach in damages as a common law right. The difference is that damages for misrepresentation usually reflect the claimant's [[reliance interest]], whereas damages for breach of contract protect the claimant's [[expectation interest]], although the rules on mitigation will apply in the latter case. In certain cases though, the courts have awarded damages for loss of profit, basing it on loss of opportunity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;name="Opportunity"&gt;See ''[[East v Maurer]]'' [1991] 2 All ER 733.&lt;/ref&gt;

S.2 does not specify how "damages in lieu" should be determined, and interpretation of the statute is up to the courts.

==Vitiating factors==
{{Contract law}}
{{main|Vitiating factors in the law of contract}}
Misrepresentation is one of several [[vitiating factor]]s that can affect the validity of a contract. Other vitiating factors include:
* [[Mistake (contract law)|Mistake]]
* [[Undue influence]]
* [[Duress in English law]]
* [[Duress in American law]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7205">In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]], a '''[[notary public]]''' is a public officer appointed by the [[Governor of Florida|governor]] of the state to take acknowledgments, administer oaths, attest to photocopies of certain documents, solemnize [[marriage]], protest the non-acceptance or non-payment of negotiable instruments [http://leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=certificate+of+dishonor&amp;URL=CH0673/Sec5051.HTM], and perform other duties specified by law.

A notary may only perform a notarial act upon receipt of satisfactory proof of identity (i.e. a [[driver's license]] or other form of [[identification card]]), or by the notary's own personal knowledge of the person appearing before them, or upon the sworn statement of two witnesses who personally know the person whose signature is to be authenticated. A notary may not notarize their own signature, or the signature of their spouse, parent, or child.

== Authority of a Florida notary public ==
Notaries Public in Florida have the authority to take acknowledgments, administer oaths, solemnize marriage, certify the contents of a safe-deposit box, certify the [[Vehicle Identification Number]] of a motor vehicle, and certify copies of non-recordable documents.

* Acknowledgments are usually taken in correlation with a real estate transaction, but are often used in cases where a mere "identity verification" is needed to ensure that the document is being executed by an authorized party.
* Oaths are administered orally in depositions and court hearings in which a party is being sworn in over the telephone instead of being personally present before a judge. In this respect, notaries administer oaths in the same way as a judge. Many court reporters are also notaries, as this allows one person to both swear the party in for a deposition and to transcribe the deposition. Oaths are also administered in the form of affidavits and other sworn statements on paper.
* Marriages may be legally solemnized by a notary public between parties who present the notary with a valid [[marriage license]]. The law has no requirements for the form of a marriage ceremony, therefore many notaries perform both civil and religious marriage ceremonies. 
* The contents of a safe-deposit box are certified by a notary public in cases where the owner has died or otherwise abandoned the safe-deposit box. In this case, the notary must be present while a bank official and other witness open the box. The notary then certifies the contents of the box and makes a certificate thereof for presentation to the court or to the personal representative of the Decedent's estate.
* Notaries are authorized by Florida law to verify the [[Vehicle Identification Number]] of a motor vehicle and certify this fact to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles when that vehicle has not previously been registered with the state.
* Notaries have the authority to make certified photocopies in cases where certified copies of a document can not be obtained from another public official. Therefore, notaries can not certify birth certificates, copies of court judgments, or public records maintained in government offices. They can, however, certify copies of passports, driver licenses, and any other document which is not eligible for public recordation.
* The most rare of notarial duties in Florida is the drafting of protests, i.e. certificates of dishonor, which certify that payment on a negotiable instrument has been refused. This is an antiquated act that appears only one place in the Florida Statutes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode%3DView+Statutes%26SubMenu%3D1%26App_mode%3DDisplay_Statute%26Search_String%3Dcertificate+of+dishonor%26URL%3DCH0673%2FSec5051.HTM |accessdate=August 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727124018/http://leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=certificate+of+dishonor&amp;URL=CH0673%2FSec5051.HTM |archivedate=July 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Commission requirements ==
Any individual at least 18 years of age who is a resident of Florida may apply for and obtain commission as a notary public, provided that they have obtained a $7,500.00 public bond from an insurance company, and taken a notary education course administered by an authorized course provider. Such commission is usually obtained by [[Legal secretary|legal secretaries]], [[paralegal]]s, and [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorneys]] for use in their place of work, where the notarization of client signatures is a requirement on many court [[pleading]]s and other documents. However, occupation in the legal profession is not a prerequisite to becoming a notary, and a person of any profession may apply for and obtain a commission. Many banks also have notaries on staff to notarize the signatures of their customers.

== Seal requirements ==
[[File:Samplenotaryseal.jpg|thumb|left|Sample Florida notary stamp]]
A notary seal of the rubber stamp type is required to be affixed to all notarized paper documents. The rubber stamp must include the commissioned name of the notary public, the words "Notary Public-State of Florida", the notary's commission number, and the date on which the notary's commission expires. Prior to the mid-1970s, the only statutory requirement regarding notarial seals was that one be used and that it include the words "Notary Public" and "State of Florida at Large"; the name of the notary was optional, and the law did not specify what types of seals were permissible. This law was later amended to state that the seal must be round in design and of either the rubber stamp or impression type. In the early 1990s, the statute was again changed to require a rubber stamp seal, with an impression type seal being optional and not acceptable unless used in conjunction with a rubber stamp. However, many notaries continue to use the impression seal with their rubber stamp to allow for easy detection when trying to determine which document is an original. This process is made more difficult for notaries who only use a rubber stamp seal, as the Florida statutes require that the seal be affixed in only photographically-reproducible black ink.

'''Open-source record labels''' are [[record label]]s that release music under [[copyleft]] [[software license|licenses]], that is, licenses that allow free redistribution and may allow free modification of the tracks.

They hold that the fight over free, [[gratis versus Libre|libre]], and [[open content]] and media is a struggle over the [[Freedom of speech|freedoms of expression and speech]], with the goal of opening up the possibilities of media through open collaboration. This is a reaction against what some musicians see as corporate control of music via means of [[copyright]]. They believe that creativity requires that musicians reappropriate and reinterpret music and sounds to enable them to create truly innovative music. Additionally, [[copyleft]] enables musicians to develop music collaboratively and equitably.

[[File:JesussHouseBedford.JPG|thumb|right|"The Ark" in Bedford.]]
The '''Panacea Society''' was a [[millenarian]] religious group in [[Bedford]], [[England]]. Founded in 1919, it followed the teachings of the Devonshire prophetess [[Joanna Southcott]], who died in 1814, and campaigned for Southcott's sealed box of prophecies to be opened according to her instructions. The society believed Bedford to be the original site of the [[Garden of Eden]].

==Founding==
[[File:Panacea Society notice 4 September 1939.jpg|thumb|upright|The notice placed in ''The Daily Telegraph'' by the society on the outbreak of the Second World War on 4 September 1939.]]
The Society's inspiration was the teachings of the Devonshire prophetess [[Joanna Southcott]] (1750–1814). It was founded by Mabel Barltrop (1866-1934) in 1919 at 12 Albany Road, Bedford. A clergyman's widow, Barltrop declared herself the 'daughter of God',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2012/28-september/features/features/private-lives-made-public&lt;/ref&gt; took the name ''Octavia'' and believed herself to be the Shiloh of Southcott's prophecies. She and 12 apostles founded the Society, originally called the ''Community of the Holy Ghost''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Octavia, the founder of the Panacea Society|url=http://panaceatrust.org/history-of-the-panacea-society/octavia/|website=Panacea Charitable Trust and Museum|accessdate=24 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130010424/http://panaceatrust.org/history-of-the-panacea-society/octavia/|archivedate=30 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central purpose of the Society was to persuade 24 [[Anglican]] bishops to open Southcott's sealed box of prophecies, and to this end, advertisements were placed in newspapers, both national and local. In the late 1920s and early 1930s the Society generated over 100,000 petitions for the box to be opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panacea Society|url=http://panaceatrust.org/history-of-the-panacea-society/|website=Panacea Charitable Trust and Museum|accessdate=24 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130005211/http://panaceatrust.org/history-of-the-panacea-society/|archivedate=30 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society claimed that the box was secreted in England. Some have claimed that it was opened in 1927 and found to contain a broken [[Flintlock|horse pistol]] and a lottery ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coates|first1=Stephen|title=Delving into the mystery of Joanna Southcott's box|url=http://londonist.com/2016/10/in-search-of-joanna-southcott-s-box|website=Londonist|publisher=Londonist Ltd.|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this setback, the group continued placing adverts in newspapers calling for action from the Church of England. In the 1970s the Society rented billboards which proclaimed "War, disease, crime and banditry, distress of nations and perplexity will increase until the Bishops open Joanna Southcott's box."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panacea Museum|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-panacea-museum|website=Atlas Obscura|publisher=Atlas Obscura|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GardenOfEdenBedford.JPG|thumb|The Society's allotments. The members claimed Bedford to be the original site of the [[Garden of Eden]].]]

==Premises==
The Society had its headquarters on Albany Road, close to the remains of [[Bedford Castle]]. Another property, an end-of-terrace house on Albany Road named ''The Ark'', was maintained as a residence for the Messiah after the [[Second Coming]].

Although small in size, the Society was relatively wealthy, owning several properties in the Castle Road area of Bedford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/Features/Prepared-for-Jesus-to-make-his-return-in-a-Bedford-house-01072011.htm Bedfordshire on Sunday: Prepared for Jesus to make his return in a Bedford house]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2001, when the Society started to sell off some of its property in order to retain its status as a charity, it was reported to have assets valued at £14m.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/jul/13/voluntarysector The Guardian: Mystic society charitably sells off the followers' silver]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
In the 1930s, about 70 members were said to be living in the Bedford community. In 1967, the ''Bedfordshire Times'' reported about 30 members living there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galaxy.bedfordshire.gov.uk/webingres/bedfordshire/vlib/0.digitised_resources/bedford_news_panacea_one.htm Bedfordshire Times report, October 1967] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201084745/http://www.galaxy.bedfordshire.gov.uk/webingres/bedfordshire/vlib/0.digitised_resources/bedford_news_panacea_one.htm |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last member of the Society, Ruth Klein, died in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/News/Religious-societys-last-member-has-died-at-80-17082012.htm Bedforshire on Sunday: Religious society's last member has died at 80]&lt;/ref&gt; when the Society ceased to exist as a religious community.

==Charitable trust==
Whilst the religious society is no longer functioning, there still exists a charity whose main remit is to sponsor academic research into the history and development of prophetic and millenarian movements, as well as provide financial assistance to support the work of registered charities and recognised groups concerned with poverty and health in the Bedford area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panacea-society.org/home.htm Panacea Society Homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522122521/http://www.panacea-society.org/home.htm |date=2013-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity officially changed its name to '''The Panacea Charitable Trust''' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Panacea Charitable Trust|url=http://panaceatrust.org/the-panacea-charitable-trust/|publisher=The Panacea Charitable Trust|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Panacea Museum==
[[File:Panacea Founders House.jpeg|thumb|The Founder's House at the Panacea Museum viewed from the garden.]]
In late 2012, it was announced that the charitable trust would be opening a museum detailing the history of the society, at 9 Newnham Road, Bedford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/news/a-house-of-god-in-the-heart-of-town-1-4329463 Bedford Times and Citizen: A house of God in the heart of town]&lt;/ref&gt; The Panacea Museum is in ‘Castleside’, a Victorian house that was part of the community's headquarters. It tells the story of the Panacea Society and other similar religious groups.

The museum also incorporates several other buildings, set within the gardens, that formed the original community's ‘campus’. The museum is open every Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday between February half term and the end of October.

A '''partially disclosed principal''' is one whose agent reveals that he has a principal, but does not reveal the principal's identity. This concept has important implications in liability law. It is in contrast to a [[disclosed principal]] and [[undisclosed principal]].&lt;ref&gt;Bohlman, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-324-06183-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18184">'''Regulatory risk differentiation'''  is the process used by a [[regulatory authority]] (the regulator) to systemically treat entities differently based on the regulator's assessment of the risks of the entity's non-compliance.

Regulators can include law enforcement agencies.  Entities refers to those under the authority/control of the regulator – in most cases ranging from individuals to companies to legal entities to multinationals operating within the regulator's jurisdiction.

The process requires the regulator to directly link a robust [[risk assessment]] to a suggested regulatory response (e.g. financial penalties, criminal imprisonment). Regulatory risk differentiation is also referred to as '''the Compliance Model''' in some [[List of United States federal agencies|regulatory agencies]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example http://www.acir.gov.au/provider/business/audits/ncp/our-compliance-model.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; See for example the [[Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority]] risk differentiation approach known as: PAIRS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apra.gov.au/adi/Documents/cfdocs/PAIRS_112010_ex.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; / SOARS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apra.gov.au/adi/Documents/cfdocs/SOARS_112010_ex.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; PAIRS is the Probability And Impact Rating System, while SOARS is the Supervisory Oversight And Response System.

== Alternative compliance models ==

=== Dualistic model ===

The simplest compliance model is a regulatory framework or model known as dualistic, where the regulator reacts to an entity's behaviours depending on whether the behaviour is seen as either right or wrong. This is also known as a black and white response, and is often used for [[strict liability]] offences in law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strict liability]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compliance continuum ===

It is a significant improvement to shift to a '''compliance continuum''' (or spectrum),  where the regulator reacts to a spectrum of compliance behaviours. The Australian Customs Office applies a compliance continuum.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the Customs Compliance Continuum @ http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/FS_CustomsCompliance.pdf or http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/ComplianceContinuumv03.pdf or http://www3.sympatico.ca/d.kerr/contin.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for example "Explaining the U.S. [[Income tax|Income Tax]] Compliance Continuum" by Brian Erard (Carleton University – Department of Economics) and Chih-Chin Ho ([[Internal Revenue Service|U.S. Internal Revenue Service]])in the 'eJournal of Tax Research, Vol. 1, No. 2' @  http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=643942&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Page 2 of STATE OF NEW YORK, DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION AND FINANCE, Strategic Plan 2007/09 @  http://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/strategic_plan/strategic_plan_2007_09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compliance pyramid ===

When the reaction of the regulator is tied to the behaviour, it is known as a '''responsive compliance model'''. The responsive compliance model was suggested by [[Ian Ayres]] and [[John Braithwaite (academic)|John Braithwaite]] in their book ''Responsive Regulation: Transcending the deregulation debate''&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, Ian and John Braithwaite (1992) "Responsive Regulation: Transcending the deregulation debate". New York: [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; which built on earlier work by [[John Scholz]].&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Scholz, "Cooperation, Deterrence and the Ecology of Regulatory Enforcement" (1984) 18 Law &amp; Soc. Rev. 179; J.T. Scholz, "Voluntary Compliance and Regulatory Enforcement" (1984) 6 Law &amp; Pol. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ayres and Braithwaite compliance model was elegantly represented as a '''compliance pyramid'''.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, Ian and John Braithwaite (1992) "Responsive Regulation: Transcending the deregulation debate". New York: Oxford University Press. Page 35. It was earlier described by John Braithwaite in "To punish or persuade", [[State University of New York]], 1985, at page 142.  The model's evolution over time is tracked in a paper by John and Valerie Braithwaite in [http://vab.anu.edu.au/pubs/1/anevolvingcompliance.pdf  "An Evolving Compliance Model for Tax Enforcement"].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alternative_compliance_models.png|thumb|left|1100px|alt=Alternative compliance models]]

{{clear}}

The shape of the compliance pyramid indicates:
* the number of clients that might be found at each level in the model,
* the hierarchical and escalating nature of regulatory engagement, and
* the increasing focus towards the apex on the small minority who appear to deliberately seek to contravene the system.

The choice of remedy (e.g. financial penalties, criminal imprisonment) imposed by the regulator becomes increasingly severe higher up the pyramid – with the view of creating an incentive for entities to move towards more compliant behaviours. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) uses a compliance pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Law &amp; Policy'', Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s the ATO's Cash Economy Project further developed their compliance pyramid.  An entity's apparent motivation for compliance or non-compliance, based on evidence (known as their motivational posture), was explicitly coupled to a suggested response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ato.gov.au/content/downloads/SB39073.pdf Improving Tax Compliance in the Cash Economy, Second Report, ATO Cash Economy Task Force, 1998, Page 58]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ATO Compliance Model.jpg|thumb|700px|none|alt=Compliance model used by ATO|The ATO Compliance Model]]

In this version of the compliance pyramid, four broad categories of client (called archetypes) were defined by their underlying motivational postures:
* The disengaged clients who have decided not to comply,
* The resistant clients who don't want to comply,
* The captured clients who try to comply, but don't always succeed, and
* The accommodating clients who are willing to do the right thing.

This approach has been widely adopted, particularly within Australia. Several other regulators have similar approaches. It is also described as the enforcement pyramid by some regulators although enforcement is only one of the compliance strategies implicit in the model.&lt;ref&gt;See Australian Medicare Compliance
[http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/resources/national_compliance/national_compliance_program_2007-08.pdf National Compliance Program], 2007–08, [[Medicare Australia]] or page 31 of http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/2/0/odonnell_ch2_497.pdf or Page 33 of http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/tax_cooperation/gen_overview/Risk_Management_Guide_for_tax_administrations_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of the model is the regulator being seen to apply the right remedy to the right situation, by taking an entity's apparent motivation (including their efforts to comply) into account. See for example Julia Black's paper: "'Chancer', 'Failure' or 'Trier'?  Regulatory Conversations and the Construction of Identities" July 2008&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.lexplosion.in&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  or "The ATO Compliance Model in Action: A Case Study of Building and Construction by Neal Shover, Jenny Job and Anne Carroll"&lt;ref&gt;http://demgov.anu.edu.au/papers/ShoverEtal2003TD(8).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  and  "Reducing the risk of policy failure: challenges for regulatory compliance"&lt;ref&gt;OECD 2000, http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/48/54/1910833.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the OECD paper "Reducing the Risk to Policy Failure: Challenges for Regulatory Compliance"&lt;ref&gt;See Box 2 page 12 in "Reducing the Risk to Policy Failure: Challenges for Regulatory Compliance," OECD, 2000 @ http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/48/54/1910833.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the regulatory responses were distilled down to ensuring that clients were '''ready, willing and able''' to comply.
*  Ready    &gt;  Clients who know what compliance is  &gt; Knowledge constraint    &gt; Educate and Exemplify
*  Willing  &gt;  Clients who want to comply           &gt; Attitudinal constraint  &gt; Engage, Encourage, Enforce
*  Able     &gt;  Clients who are able to comply       &gt; Capability constraint   &gt; Enable and Empower

A similar framework is used in the UK Pension Regulator approach.&lt;ref&gt;See pages 8 onward in the 2012–15 Corporate Plan @ http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/docs/corporate-plan-2012-2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk bow-tie diagram ===

Another way of looking at this is as a risk '''bow-tie'''.  See bow tie diagrams in [[risk management]]

[[Image:Regulatory Compliance Risk Bow-Tie.png|thumb|750px|none|alt=Generic Tax Compliance Risk Bow-Tie developed by Stuart Hamilton from the ATO|Generic Tax Compliance Risk Bow-Tie used by the ATO]].

Organisations in oil and gas, mining, aviation, industrials and finance have had success using bowties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bowtiexp.com.au/bowtiexp.asp#aboutBowTies RPS HSE &amp; Risk Management - BowtieXP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Risk Bow Ties: Originally conceived of in the late 1970s by the University of Queensland and then brought to the fore by Shell after the Piper Alpha disaster.  Now a widespread risk approach the 'bow-tie' usefully shows the 'paths' by which a risk event can occur, where preventative or deterrent controls are used, the event itself and detective controls and the consequence paths and restorative controls.  http://www.bowtiepro.com/bowtie_history.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

These compliance enhancement strategies fit into a standard structure:
*  deter, (educate, exemplify, engage, encourage, enable, empower)
*  detect, (using quantitative and qualitative intelligence) and
*  deal with (educate, exemplify, engage, encourage, enable, empower, enforce)&lt;ref&gt;See for example page 47 of "Development of risk and intelligence systems" @ http://www.itdweb.org/documents/SGATAR-NZ-Risk%20and%20Intel%20v1.0%20061102.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for example page 23 of "Large Business and tax compliance" @ http://ato.gov.au/content/downloads/bus33802nat8675062010.pdf and the Commissioners Speech "Do you see what I see" @ http://ato.gov.au/corporate/content.asp?doc=/content/00228656.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==What happens when the law is uncertain?==

Some commentators do not believe that the compliance pyramid applies when legitimate differences of views exist as to compliant behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Mark Burton's detailed paper "Responsive Regulation and the Uncertainty of [[Tax law|Tax Law]] – Time to Reconsider the Commissioner's Model of Cooperative Compliance?" @ http://www.atax.unsw.edu.au/ejtr/content/issues/previous/paper4_v5n1.pdf, eJournal of Tax Research, Volume 5, Number 1 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Regulators all need to establish their positions in this situation, but it is clear that some regulators do still apply the compliance pyramid when the law is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the Large business and tax compliance booklet @ http://www.ato.gov.au/corporate/content.aspx?doc=/content/33802.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk matrix mapping – risk differentiation framework ==

'''Explicitly considering the likelihood and consequence of the risk of regulatory non-compliance'''

Some regulators vary regulatory risk differentiation approaches by mapping suggested remedies to an entity's [[Risk perception|perceived risk]] of non-compliance.  This approach has been used by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, the Australian Taxation Office and the UK Pension Regulator&lt;ref&gt;See for example "Supervisory Oversight And Response System" @  http://www.apra.gov.au/adi/Documents/cfdocs/SOARS_112010_ex.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for example "Developing an enhanced relationship – achieving [[voluntary compliance]] and minimising costs to clients" @ http://www.ato.gov.au/taxprofessionals/content.asp?doc=/content/00187285.htm&amp;pc=001/001/001/002/002&amp;mnu=4068&amp;mfp=001/005&amp;st=&amp;cy=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for example pages 8 on in the UK Pension Regulator 2012-15 Corporate plan @ http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/docs/corporate-plan-2012-2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Explicitly considering the likelihood and consequences of an entity possibly breaking a law is a requirement of the UK Statutory Code of Practice for Regulators&lt;ref&gt;The UK Statutory Code of Practice for Regulators is available @ {{cite web |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file45019.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620002239/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file45019.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which emerged from the 2005 [[Hampton Report]] "Reducing administrative burdens – effective inspection and enforcement".&lt;ref&gt;The Hampton report is available @ {{cite web |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file22988.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012010718/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file22988.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The later Macrory Review "Regulatory Justice – making sanctions effective"&lt;ref&gt;The Macrory Review is available @ {{cite web |url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file44593.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302065851/http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file44593.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively codifies the Ayres and Braithwaite Compliance Pyramid into the UK Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008.&lt;ref&gt;The UK Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008 is available @ http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/13/pdfs/ukpga_20080013_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In these compliance models the possibility of entities breaking a law has both a likelihood of occurrence and a consequence of occurrence, known as a 'risk event'. Considering entities' likelihood of not complying and the consequences of their not complying usually provides a 'power distribution'&lt;ref&gt;See for example "Power laws, Pareto distributions and Zipf's law" by M. Newman, 2006 @ https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0412004v3&lt;/ref&gt; of a few large consequence or higher likelihood clients and many more lower consequence/likelihood ones.

This can be represented as a [[Scatterplot|scatter plot]] on a [[risk matrix]], as shown in the adjacent diagram.

[[Image:Risk matrix - Pareto Distribution.jpg|thumb|340px|left|alt=Scatterplot of likelihood and consequences of entities breaking a law|Scatterplot of ratings of risk of entities breaking a law]]

The scatterplot risk matrix to the left shows that most entities are compliant most of the time – in other words, assessed as both lower consequence and lower likelihood of their not complying with the law.

From a [[risk management]] perspective the regulator has a more significant interest in higher consequence clients or events than lower consequence. The next two diagrams build on the scatterplot diagram to the left.

[[Image:Risk matrix with simple quadrant strategy.jpg|thumb|340px|left|frameless|alt=Overlaying detection strategies onto risk matrix|ATO risk matrix]]

In this example, The ATO links its strategies to the likelihood and/or consequences of entities not complying with a law. The ATO risk matrix to the left shows how the ATO divides its clients into four categories, and allocates appropriate detection strategies to each category.

These strategies are proactive and continuous for higher consequence, reactive and periodic for lower consequence. The strategies are reviewing for taxpayers more likely to break the law, and only monitoring for those less likely.

[[Image:Quadrant Framework.jpg|thumb|340px|left|frameless|alt=The same overlay with more detail|Detailed ATO risk matrix]]

The diagram to the left provides more detail, giving names to each category of client, providing all of the strategies - deter, detect and deal with strategies, and the strategies' associated activities.

It is important to note that the boundaries between category are able to be moved to allocate more or fewer clients to each category. It is normal to see fewer higher likelihood and/or consequence clients rather than 50% of the population or 50% of the assessed likelihood or consequence. In other words, the boundary is shifted so there can be a strong focus on the few assessed to be higher risk.

This allows more resources to be allocated to more intensive strategies focusing on higher risk entities, providing an incentive to entities to want to be seen to be compliant. The robustness of the risk assessments, and the quality of the data on which the assessments rely, are therefore very important.

The diagram below shows how end to end risk management steps (from [[ISO 31000]]) align with risk differentiation and the risk bow-tie.

== Use of the regulatory risk differentiation approach, including awards ==

In September 2009 the UK Pension Regulator, which uses this approach, was shortlisted for a [[Better regulation|Better Regulation]] Award&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk - note that the page is cached so you will need to search on the site for 'better regulation award 2011'&lt;/ref&gt;

The above approach was discussed in the ATO Commissioners speech "Do you see what I see" given to the Australian Tax Teachers Association in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ato.gov.au/corporate/content.asp?doc=/content/00228656.htm Do you see what I see?]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010 the ATO released its revised "Large Business and Tax Compliance" booklet that detailed its approach to risk differentiation in the Large Market&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ato.gov.au/content/downloads/bus33802nat8675062010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 the risk differentiation approach was also 'highly commended' in the annual Australian Comcover Risk awards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finance.gov.au/comcover/awards/awards-2010.html Comcover Awards for Excellence - Department of Finance and Deregulation]&lt;/ref&gt;  The entire approach is mapped out in the UNSW ATAX 2012 paper 'New dimensions in regulatory compliance' &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.business.unsw.edu.au/research-site/publications-site/ejournaloftaxresearch-site/Documents/paper12_v10n2_Hamilton.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''START''' ('''Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty''') was a [[bilateral treaty]] between the [[United States|United States of America]] and the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) on the reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms. The treaty was signed on 31 July 1991 and entered into force on 5 December 1994.&lt;ref name="Treaty"&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2018}}{{cite web | url = http://www.dod.mil/acq/acic/treaties/start1/execsum.htm | title = Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I): Executive Summary | publisher = The Office of Treaty Compliance | accessdate = 5 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty barred its signatories from deploying more than 6,000 [[nuclear warhead]]s atop a total of 1,600 inter-continental [[ballistic missile]]s ([[ICBMs]]) and bombers. START negotiated the largest and most complex arms control treaty in history, and its final implementation in late 2001 resulted in the removal of about 80 percent of all strategic nuclear weapons then in existence. Proposed by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], it was renamed '''START I''' after negotiations began on the second START treaty.

The START I treaty expired 5 December 2009. On 8 April 2010, the replacement [[New START]] treaty was signed in Prague by United States President [[Barack Obama]] and Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]]. Following ratification by the [[U.S. Senate]] and the [[Federal Assembly of Russia]], it went into force on 26 January 2011. This Treaty was the first to provide tremendous reductions of American and Soviet/Russian [[strategic nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref name="nti.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaties-between-united-states-america-and-union-soviet-socialist-republics-strategic-offensive-reductions-start-i-start-ii/ | title=Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on Strategic Offensive Reductions (START I) &amp;#124; Treaties &amp; Regimes &amp;#124; NTI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dnepr rocket lift-off 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Soviet [[R-36 (missile)|SS-18]] intercontinental ballistic missile]]
[[File:Peacekeeper missile.jpg|thumb|right|upright|American [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]] intercontinental ballistic missile]]
The START proposal was first announced by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in a commencement address at his alma mater, [[Eureka College]] on 9 May 1982,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1982/50982a.htm Eureka College Commencement Speech, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; and presented by President Reagan in Geneva on 29 June 1982. Reagan proposed a dramatic reduction in strategic forces in two phases, which he referred to as SALT III at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921207,00.html Time to START, Says Reagan]&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase would reduce overall warhead counts on any missile type to 5,000, with an additional limit of 2,500 on [[ICBM]]s. Additionally, a total of 850 ICBMs would be allowed, with a limit of 110 "heavy throw" missiles like the [[SS-18]], with additional limits on the total "throw weight" of the missiles as well. The second phase introduced similar limits on [[heavy bomber]]s and their warheads, and other strategic systems as well.

At the time the US had a commanding lead in strategic bombers. The US [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] force, while aged, was a credible strategic threat but was only equipped with [[AGM-86]] cruise missiles, beginning in 1982, because of Soviet air defense improvements in the early 1980s. The US also had begun to introduce the new [[B-1 Lancer|B-1B Lancer]] quasi-stealth bomber and was secretly developing the Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) project that would eventually result in the [[B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber. The USSR's force was of little threat to the US, on the other hand, as it was tasked almost entirely with attacking US convoys in the Atlantic and land targets on the Eurasian landmass. Although the USSR had 1,200 medium and heavy bombers, only 150 of them ([[Tupolev Tu-95]]s and [[Myasishchev M-4]]s) could reach North America (the latter only with in-flight refueling). They also faced difficult problems in penetrating the admittedly smaller and less heavily defended US airspace. Possessing too few bombers available when compared to US bomber numbers was evened out by the US forces having to penetrate the much larger and heavier defended Soviet airspace. This changed when new [[Tu-95]]MS and [[Tu-160]] bombers appeared in 1984 equipped with the first Soviet [[Kh-55|AS-15]] cruise missiles. By limiting the phase-in as it was proposed, the US would be left with a strategic advantage, for a time.

As ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine put it at the time, "Under Reagan's ceilings, the US would have to make considerably less of an adjustment in its strategic forces than would the Soviet Union. That feature of the proposal will almost certainly prompt the Soviets to charge that it is unfair and one-sided. No doubt some American arms-control advocates will agree, accusing the Administration of making the Kremlin an offer it cannot possibly accept—a deceptively equal-looking, deliberately nonnegotiable proposal that is part of what some suspect is the hardliners' secret agenda of sabotaging disarmament so that the US can get on with the business of rearmament." However, ''Time'' did point out that, "The Soviets' monstrous ICBMs have given them a nearly 3-to-1 advantage over the US in 'throw weight'—the cumulative power to 'throw' megatons of death and destruction at the other nation."

== Costs ==
Three institutes ran studies in regards to the estimated costs that the United States government would have to pay to implement START I which included the [[Congressional Budget Office|Congressional Budget Office (CBO)]], the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC)]], and the [[Institute for Defense Analyses|Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA)]]. In regards to the CBO estimates, it was assumed that the full-implementation cost would consist of a one-time cost of $410–1,830 million and continuing annual costs of $100–390 million.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Costs of Verification and Compliance Under Pending Arms Treaties, U.S. Congress, Congressional Budget Office, September 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The SFRC had estimates of $200–1,000 million for one-time costs and that total inspection costs over the 15-year period of the treaty would be $1,250-2,050 million.&lt;ref name="The START Treaty 1992"&gt;The START Treaty, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, September 18, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the IDA estimated only in regards to the verification costs which they claimed to be around $760 million.&lt;ref&gt;Arms Control Reporter, 1994, pp. 701.D.5-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the costs of the implementation of the treaty, the United States was also paying aid to the former Soviet Union Republics through the [[Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction|Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (Nunn-Lugar Program)]]. This program added $591 million to the costs of implementing the START I program in the former Soviet Union, which would almost double the cost of the program for the United States.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Allan S. Krass, The United States and Arms Control: The Challenge of Leadership, Praeger Publishers, Westport, CT 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

After the implementation of the treaty, the former Soviet Union’s stock of nuclear weapons would fall from 12,000 to 3,500. The United States would also save money since it would not have to be concerned with the upkeep and innovations towards its own nuclear forces. The CBO estimated that this would amount to a total saving of $46 billion in the first five years of the treaty and around $130 billion through 2010. This would pay for the cost of the implementation of the treaty about 20 times over.&lt;ref name="The START Treaty 1992"/&gt;

The other risks associated with START is the failure of compliance on the side of Russia. The [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Defence Committee]] expressed concerns that Russia could covertly produce missiles, produce false numbers regarding numbers of warheads, and monitoring cruise missiles. The Joint Chiefs of Staff assessment of these situations determined that the risk of a significant violation of the treaty was within acceptable limits. Another risk would be the ability for Russia to perform espionage during the inspection of United States’ bases and military facilities. The risk of this was also determined to be an acceptable factor by the assessment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Considering the potential savings from the implementation of START I and the relatively low risk factor included, Ronald Reagan and the United States Government deemed it a reasonable plan of action towards the goal of disarmament.

== Negotiations ==

Negotiations for START I began in May 1982, though continued negotiation of the START process was delayed several times because US agreement terms were considered non-negotiable by pre-Gorbachev Soviet rulers. President Reagan's introduction of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) program in 1983 was viewed as a threat by the Soviet Union, and the Soviets withdrew from setting a timetable for further negotiations. In January 1985 however, U.S. Secretary of State [[George P. Shultz|George Schultz]] and Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrei Gromyko|Andrey Gromyko]] discussed a formula for a three part negotiation strategy that included  intermediate-range forces, strategic defense, and missile defense. During the [[Reykjavík Summit|Reykjavik summit]] between Presidents Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, negotiations towards the implementation of the START Program were accelerated. Negotiations turned towards the reduction of strategic weapons when the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] was signed in December 1987.&lt;ref&gt;KM Kartchner, Negotiating START: Strategic Arms Reduction Talks and the Quest for Strategic Stability&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, a dramatic [[nuclear arms race]] proceeded during the 1980s, and essentially ended in 1991 by nuclear parity preservation at a level of more than ten thousand strategic warheads on both sides.

==Verification Tools==
The verification regimes in arms control treaties contain many tools that enable them to hold Parties accountable for their actions and violations of their treaty agreements.&lt;ref name="nti.org"/&gt; The START Treaty verification provisions were the most complicated and demanding of any agreement at the time as it provided twelve different types of inspection. Data exchanges and declarations between Parties became required which included exact quantities, technical characteristics, locations, movements, and status of all offensive nuclear threats. The [[National technical means of verification]] (NTM) provision protected satellites and other information-gathering systems controlled by the verifying side as they helped to verify adherence of international treaties. The International technical means of verification provision protected the multilateral technical systems specified in other treaties. Cooperative measures were established to facilitate verification by the NTM which included displaying items in plain sight and not hiding them from detection. The new on-site inspections (OSI) and  Perimeter and Portal Continuous Monitoring (PPCM) provisions both helped to maintain the integrity of the Treaty by providing a regulatory system manned by a representative from the verifying side at all times.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Amy F. “Monitoring and Verification in Arms Control .” Congressional Research Service, 23 Dec. 2011, fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R41201.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, access to [[telemetry]] from ballistic missile flight tests are now required, including exchanges of tapes and ban on encryption and encapsulation from both Parties.&lt;ref&gt;Ifft, Edward (2014).

== Signing ==
Negotiations that led to the signing of this Treaty began in May 1982. During November 1983, the Soviet Union "discontinued" communication with the United States after American intermediate-range missiles were deployed in Europe. During January 1985, [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[George Schultz]] and [[Soviet Foreign Minister]] [[Andrey Gromyko]] negotiated a three-part plan that included strategic weapons, intermediate missiles, and missile defense which received a lot of attention at the Reykjavik summit between Ronald Reagan and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and ultimately led to the signing of the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] in December 1987.&lt;ref name="nti.org"/&gt; Talk of a comprehensive strategic arms reduction continued and the START Treaty was officially signed by U.S. [[President George H.W. Bush]] and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev on 31 July 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, Lawrence D. “Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.” Britannica, www.britannica.com/event/Strategic-Arms-Reduction-Talks#ref261940.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
[[File:B-52s chopped.jpg|thumb|right|[[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52G Stratofortresses]] chopped into five pieces at [[Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center|AMARC]]]]

Three hundred sixty-five B-52s were flown to the [[Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center]] at [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]] in Arizona.{{When|date=April 2014}} The bombers were stripped of all usable parts, then chopped into five pieces by a 13,000-pound steel blade dropped from a crane. The [[guillotine]] sliced four times on each plane, severing the wings and leaving the fuselage in three pieces. The ruined B-52s remained in place for three months so that Russian satellites could confirm that the bombers had been destroyed, after which they were sold for scrap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/experience/the.bomb/route/06.amarc/ CNN.

The latter three became non-nuclear weapons states under the Treaty on the non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1 July 1968 (NPT) as they committed to do under the [[Lisbon Protocol]] (Protocol to the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms) after becoming independent nations in the wake of the breakup of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Lisbon Protocol, signed by the five START Parties 23 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos CIA Fact Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy==
Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine have disposed of all their nuclear weapons or transferred them to Russia, while the U.S. and Russia have reduced the capacity of delivery vehicles to 1,600 each, with no more than 6,000 warheads.&lt;ref name="RIAnovosti"/&gt;

A report by the US State Department called "Adherence to and Compliance With Arms Control, Nonproliferation and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments" which was released on July 28, 2010, stated that Russia was not in full compliance with the treaty when it expired on 5 December 2009.  The report did not specifically identify Russia's compliance issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Gertz|Gertz, Bill]], "Russia Violated '91 START Till End, U.S. Report Finds", ''[[Washington Times]]'', 28 July 2010, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

One incident that occurred in regards to Russia violating the START I treaty occurred in 1994. It was announced by [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency|ACDA]] Director [[John D. Holum|John Holum]] in a congressional testimony that Russia had converted its [[SS-19]] ICBM into a space-launch vehicle without notifying the appropriate parties.&lt;ref&gt;A Revitalized ACDA in the Post-Cold War World, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, June 23, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Russia justified this incident claiming that it did not have to follow all of START’s reporting policies in regards to missiles that had been recreated into space-launch vehicles. In addition to the SS-19, Russia was also reportedly using [[SS-25]] missiles to assemble space-launch vehicles. The issue that the United States had with this was that it did not have accurate numbers and locations of Russian ICBM’s with these violations. The dispute was later resolved in 1995.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Expiration and renewal==
[[Image:Ss18.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet [[SS-18]] inspected by U.S. Senator [[Richard Lugar]] before its destruction]]
START I expired 5 December 2009. Both sides agreed to continue observing the terms of the treaty until a new agreement is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8434260.stm |title=US rejects Russian missile shield concerns |date=29 December 2009 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are proposals to renew and expand the treaty, supported by [[U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]]. [[Sergei Rogov]], director of the Institute of the U.S. and Canada, said: "Obama supports sharp reductions in nuclear arsenals and I believe that Russia and the U.S. may sign in the summer or fall of 2009 a new treaty that would replace START-1". He added that a new deal would only happen if Washington abandoned plans to place elements of a missile shield in central Europe. He expressed willingness "to make new steps in the sphere of disarmament", however, saying they were waiting for the U.S. to abandon attempts to "surround Russia with a missile defense ring". This referred to the placement of ten [[National missile defense|interceptor missiles]] in [[Poland]], as well as an accompanying radar in the [[Czech Republic]].

[[Russian President]] [[Dmitri Medvedev]], said, the day after the U.S. elections, in his first state of the nation address, that Russia would move to deploy short-range [[Iskander missile]] systems in the western [[exclave]] of [[Kaliningrad]] "to neutralize if necessary the anti-ballistic missile system in Europe". Russia insists that any movement towards a new START should be a legally binding document, and must, then, set lower ceilings on the number of nuclear warheads, and their delivery vehicles.&lt;ref name="RIAnovosti"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081106/118158928.html | title=Russia, U.S. May sign new START treaty in mid-2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March 2009, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev signaled that Russia would begin a "large-scale" rearmament and renewal of Russia's nuclear arsenal.  President Medvedev accused NATO of pushing ahead with expansion near Russian borders and ordered that this rearmament commence in 2011 with increased army, naval, and nuclear capabilities.  Additionally, the head of Russia's strategic missile forces, Nikolai Solovtsov, told news agencies that Russia would start deploying its next-generation [[RS-24]] missiles after the 5 December expiry of the START-1 treaty with the United States.  Russia hopes to change the START-1 treaty with a new accord. The increased tensions come despite the warming of relations between the United States and Russia in the two years since U.S. President Barack Obama took office.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090317/ts_afp/russianatomilitarynuclear&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May 2009, the United States and Russia began the process of renegotiating START, as well as counting both nuclear warheads and their delivery vehicles when making a new agreement. While setting aside problematic issues between the two countries, both sides agreed to make further cuts in the number of warheads they have deployed to around 1,000 to 1,500 each. The United States has said they are open to a Russian proposal to use radar in Azerbaijan rather than Eastern Europe for the proposed missile system. The Bush Administration insisted that the Eastern Europe defense system was intended as a deterrent for Iran, while the Kremlin feared that it could be used against Russia. The flexibility by both sides to make compromises now will lead to a new phase of arms reduction in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/world/europe/05russia.html | work=The New York Times | title=U.S. Negotiator Signals Flexibility Toward Moscow Over New Round of Arms Talks | first=Ellen | last=Barry | date=5 May 2009 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "Joint understanding for a follow-on agreement to START-1" was signed by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitri Medvedev in Moscow on 6 July 2009.  This will reduce the number of deployed warheads on each side to 1,500–1,675 on 500–1,100 delivery systems. A new treaty was to be signed before START-1 expired in December 2009 and the reductions are to be achieved within seven years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8136918.stm US and Russia agree nuclear cuts, accessed 16 July 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; After many months of negotiations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25start.html | work=The New York Times | title=Russia and U.S. Report Breakthrough on Arms | first1=Peter | last1=Baker | first2=Ellen | last2=Barry | date=24 March 2010 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Early March 2010 [[Ukrainian President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] had proposed to both Russia and the United States to sign the treaty in [[Kiev]], the [[Capital city|capital]] of [[Ukraine]] (Source: [http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/61829/ Ukraine awaiting reply to offer of Kyiv as venue for Russia-U.S. arms cuts deal signing], [[Kyiv Post]] (16 March 2010))&lt;/ref&gt; Presidents Obama and Medvedev signed the successor treaty, [[Measures to Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms]], in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]] on 8 April 2010.

==New START Treaty==

Main article [[New START Treaty]]

The New START Treaty imposed even more limitations on the United States and Russia which reduced them to both significantly less strategic arms within seven years from when it enters into full force. Organized into three tiers, the new Treaty focusses on the Treaty itself, Protocol which contains additional rights and obligations regarding the Treaty provisions, and Technical Annexes to the protocol.&lt;ref name="ciaonet.org"&gt;Columbia International Affairs Online, 2010, http://www.ciaonet.org/record/18773?search=1&lt;/ref&gt;

These limits were based on stringent analysis conducted by Department of Defense planners in support of the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review. These aggregate limits consists of 1,550 nuclear warheads which includes warheads on deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles ([[ICBM]]), warheads on deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles ([[SLBM]]), and even any deployed heavy bomber equipped for nuclear armaments. This is 74 percent fewer than the limit previously set in the 1991 Treaty and 30 percent fewer than the limit of the [[Treaty of Moscow (2002)|2002 Moscow Treaty]]. Both parties will also be limited to a combined total of 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. There is also a separate limit of 700 deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs, and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments which is less than half the corresponding strategic nuclear delivery vehicle limit imposed in the previous Treaty. Although these new restrictions have been set, the new Treaty does not contain any limitations regarding the testing, development, or deployment of current or planned U.S. missile defense programs and low-range conventional strike capabilities.&lt;ref name="ciaonet.org"/&gt;

The duration of the new Treaty is ten years and can be extended for a period of no more than five years at a time. It includes a standard withdrawal clause like most arms control agreements. The 2002 Moscow Treaty has been superseded by thus subsequent Treaty.&lt;ref name="ciaonet.org"/&gt;

A '''salt tax''' was a tax levied directly on [[salt]], usually proportional to the amount of salt purchased. In ancient times, salt was extremely valuable as a preservant. Words such as ''[[wiktionary:salary|salary]]'' are derived from the same root as salt and indicate its vitality to civilizations. As an example, ancient "salaries" could literally be quantities of salt.

Due to the scarcity and importance of salt, levying a tax on its commerce was extremely lucrative, but also widely despised and controversial.

Notable examples of salt taxation throughout history include:
*The French [[Gabelle]], which was a contributing factor to the [[French Revolution]]
*The [[Salt in Chinese history|salt tax in China]] at various times including that under the [[Salt Commission]] of Tang and Yuan China.
*The [[History of the British salt tax in India|salt tax in India]] including that under the British. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] protested this with the [[Salt March]], and it was a contributing factor to the [[Indian independence movement]].
*A Russian salt tax led to an uprising known as the [[Moscow uprising of 1648]].
* The ''solărit'' tax in the [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]] during the 16th-18th century.

==Salt tax in alternate form==
In 2014, it is still illegal in certain provinces of China to use salt from a neighbor city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hk.apple.appledaily.com/realtime/china/20141018/53033748 ''Apple Daily'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Select Committee on Reserves (Reserve 43131) Bill 2003''' is an Australian [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] that investigated the eviction of the [[Swan Valley Nyungah Community]] (SVNC) from their traditional land through the use of the [[Reserves (Reserve 43131) Bill 2003]].  It investigated the motives of the Western Australian [[Gallop Ministry|Gallop government]] in proposing and passing the bill.

==Background==
The [[Noongar|Nyungah]] [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] peoples have made attempts to reclaim their traditional land since 1919 when the [[Guildford, Western Australia|Guildford]] Aboriginals were [[transhipped]] to the [[Moore River (Western Australia)|Moore River]] native settlement. [[Robert Bropho]], an Aboriginal elder, and his extended family campaigned vigorously for the right to occupy the area which presently takes in [[Reserve 43131]]. The SVNAC was established in 1977 and under the ''[[Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972]]'' they were given control of the reserve.

On 12 February 1999 a 15-year-old Aboriginal woman named Susan Taylor committed suicide in the reserve&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s650033.htm 7.30 Report - 15 August 2002: Call for national response to child sex abuse report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and on 22–30 October 2001 a coronial inquiry was held. The inquest investigated the circumstances in which Taylor and other Aboriginal young people lived. It accepted evidence that rape and [[sexual abuse]] of Aboriginal minors was widespread in Western Australia; that [[sexually transmitted diseases]] were higher than with non-Aboriginal children; that Aboriginal mortality rates are many times higher than that of the non-Aboriginal community and that drug taking with Aboriginal people was a major problem. The Coroner also heard evidence "regarding alleged sexual abuse taking place in locations near the Reserve by Caucasian males providing paint or glue to young people for sexual favours. Allegations were also made against Bropho of sexual misconduct, involving Taylor and her mother Lena Spratt. An allegation of indecent assault made by Taylor against Bropho's son, Richard Bropho, was not pursued due to her death and a lack of corroborating evidence. Robert and Richard Bropho have strenuously denied these allegations." (2.28, page 57, ''Select Committee'') The coroner found that government departments should not be restricted from Aboriginal reserves due to the alleged situation of abuse in Aboriginal communities. Allegations were also made that Robert Bropho had stopped the [[Aboriginal Medical Service]] from visiting the reserve due to the death of an infant, and in 1996 had also stopped the Department of Family and Children’s Services after a child had disclosed inappropriate touching by older boys.

===Gordon Inquiry===
In the aftermath of the coronial inquiry, the Western Australian government established an inquiry entitled ''Inquiry into Response by Government Agencies to Complaints of Family Violence and Child Abuse in Aboriginal Communities'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon|Report of the Inquiry...]]&lt;/ref&gt; or better known as the ''[[Gordon Inquiry]]'' after the chairwoman, Family Court Magistrate [[Sue Gordon]]. It was announced on 29 November 2001 by the [[Premier of Western Australia]], [[Geoff Gallop]]. Its terms of reference were to examine the way that "Government agencies dealt with issues of violence and child sexual abuse at the Swan Valley Nyoongar community"; to examine "how State Government agencies respond to evidence of family violence and child sexual abuse that may be occurring in Aboriginal communities generally" and to give "recommendations on practical solutions for addressing incidents of sexual abuse in Aboriginal communities, including any necessary legislative and administrative measures".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon|Report of the Inquiry...]], p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt;

Published on 31 July 2002 the "Gordon Report" made a number of recommendations in respect of the [[Swan Valley Nyungah Community]] and government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon|Report of the Inquiry...]]; see Recommendation 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
The Report of the Upper House Select Committee on Reserves (Reserve 43131) Bill 2003 found that Premier [[Geoff Gallop]]’s decision “to act rapidly, by-passing all normal processes, was justified on false information”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon|Report of the Inquiry...]], 37.&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that the Government “was not in a position to accommodate former residents of the SVNC quickly” and had “significantly underestimated the number of families and individuals requiring assistance”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon|Report of the Inquiry...]], finding 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Select Committee made findings against the conduct of Premier Gallop’s media adviser Kieran Murphy, who promised an exclusive story to newspaper journalist Colleen Egan. The report concluded that this “made Mr Murphy’s active participation in decision making all the more improper”,&lt;ref name="Report_32"&gt;[[#Gordon|Report of the Inquiry...]], 32.&lt;/ref&gt; “In particular, Mr Murphy’s obligation to deliver to Ms Egan a dramatic and media-worthy response mitigated against a considered and measured resolution”&lt;ref name="Report_32"/&gt; The Select Committee also found against Sean Walsh, Premier Gallop’s Chief of Staff. The Report concluded that he had “completely bypassed the convention that public servants should advise vigorously and honestly and governments should decide in the light of their advice”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon|Report of the Inquiry...]], 30.&lt;/ref&gt; It suggested that Walsh's conduct constituted a disciplinary offence under section 74 of the 1994 Public Sector Management Act.

The Select Committee also made findings against Richard Curry, Director General of the Department of Indigenous Affairs and Jane Brazier, Director General of the Department of Community Development, who “gave responses to the Premier based on incorrect, misleading and unsubstantiated anecdotal evidence”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon|Report of the Inquiry...]], p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and did not test “the veracity of information given to them or their departments in areas that they should have known to be a government priority”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon|Report of the Inquiry...]], 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Curry and Brazier had “no proper basis for providing advice to the Premier”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon|Report of the Inquiry...]], Findings 8 and 10.&lt;/ref&gt; as their departments were “inactive in regard to the Lord Street Camp”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon|Report of the Inquiry...]], 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Directors General “hadn't checked what their departments were doing before making their decision”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon|Report of the Inquiry...]], 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magistrate Sue Gordon, who was interviewed by the Select Committee and said: “I would not single out the [[Swan Valley Nyungah Community]]. That was just in the media the most because of Mr [[Robert Bropho|Bropho]] and the allegations against him. There are allegations against a lot of other so-called leaders but they do not get as much publicity”.&lt;ref name="Report_7"&gt;[[#Gordon|Report of the Inquiry...]], Session 1, 30 June 2004, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon, who said the Swan Valley Nyungah Community was “an adequate and reasonably well maintained facility”&lt;ref name="Report_7"/&gt; also said "I do not think there are any similarities whatsoever between a management order and a memorandum of understanding”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon|Report of the Inquiry...]], p 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11146">'''Shepard's Citations''' is a [[citator]] used in [[United States]] [[legal research]] that provides a list of all the authorities citing a particular case, statute, or other legal authority. The verb '''Shepardizing''' refers to the process of consulting Shepard's to see if a case has been overturned, reaffirmed, questioned, or cited by later cases.  Although the name is trademarked, it is also used informally by legal professionals to describe [[citator]]s in general—for example, [[Westlaw]]'s similar tool called [[Key Cite]].

==History==
The name derives from a legal service begun by [[Frank Shepard]] (1848–1902) in 1873, when Shepard began publishing these lists in a series of books indexed to different [[jurisdiction]]s.  Initially, the product was called Shepard’s Adhesive Annotations.  The citations were printed on gummed, perforated sheets, which could be divided and pasted onto pages of case law. Known as “stickers,” these were literally torn to bits and stuck to pertinent margins of case reporters. 

By the early 20th century, the [[Frank Shepard Company]] was binding the citations into maroon volumes with Shepard’s Citations stamped in gold on their spines, much like the ones still found on library shelves.&lt;ref name=Lexis&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aallnet.org/main-menu/Publications/spectrum/Archives/Vol-8/pub_sp0405/pub-sp0405-criv.pdf |title=The Future of Shepard’s Citations in Print |first= Jane W. |last=Morris |work=The Newsletter on the Committee of Relations with Information Vendors |publisher=American Association of Law Librarians |volume=26 |number=3 |date=May 2004 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of [[William Guthrie Packard]], the company endured the [[Great Depression]] and continued to grow. It moved to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] in 1948; in 1951, it adopted the name Shepard's Citations, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usps.com/judicial/1974deci/1-88.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606055828/http://www.usps.com/judicial/1974deci/1-88.htm |archivedate=June 6, 2011 |title=Appeal of P.S. Docket No. 1/88e -- Shepard's Citations, Inc. |publisher=United States Postal Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Shepard's Citations was acquired by [[McGraw Hill Financial|McGraw Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The McGraw-Hill Companies Timeline | accessdate = 2014-08-23 | url = http://www.ulib.niu.edu/publishers/McGraw-Hill.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Shepard's was purchased by [[Times Mirror]] and [[Reed Elsevier]] (owner of [[LexisNexis]] since 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | issn = 0458-3035 | last = LEE | first = PATRICK | title = Times Mirror to Boost Its Legal Publishing Unit With Shepard's | work = Los Angeles Times | accessdate = 2014-08-23 | date = 1996-07-04 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-04/business/fi-21065_1_times-mirror-co }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998, LexisNexis bought full ownership of Shepard's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | issn = 0362-4331 | last = Barringer | first = Felicity | title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Times Mirror Sells Legal Unit To British-Dutch Publisher | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2014-08-23 | date = 1998-04-28 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/28/business/the-media-business-times-mirror-sells-legal-unit-to-british-dutch-publisher.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; After this acquisition, LexisNexis engaged in a "multi-million-dollar Citations Redesign (CR) project" which "redesigned the way we process case law and citations."&lt;ref name=Lexis /&gt;

==Decline of print usage==
In March 1999, LexisNexis released an online version of the Shepard's Citation Service.&lt;ref name=OneMoreLook&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.llrx.com/features/shepards.htm |title=One More Look at Shepard's Citation Service: A Private Law Librarian's Perspective |first=Robyn |last=Rebollo |publisher=LLRX.com |date=August 31, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While print versions of Shepard's remain in use, their use is declining. Although learning to Shepardize in print was once a rite of passage for all first-year law students,&lt;ref name=Lexis /&gt; the Shepard's Citations booklets in hard copy format are extremely cryptic compared to the online version, because of the need to cram as much information about as many cases in as little space as possible.  

Shepard's paper format consists of long tables of citations (with full case titles omitted) preceded by one or two-letter codes indicating their relationship to the case being Shepardized.  Before Lexis became widely available, generations of lawyers (and law clerks and assistants) had to manually locate the Shepard's entry for a case, decipher all the cryptic abbreviations, then manually retrieve all the cases which were marked by Shepard's as criticizing or overruling a particular case, to determine whether the later cases had directly overruled that particular case on the specific issue for which one was interested.  In many jurisdictions in the U.S., it is still possible to cite a case as good law even though it has been overruled, as long as it was overruled on another issue and not the specific issue for which it is being cited.  

In 2004, market research by LexisNexis indicated that most attorneys and librarians conduct the majority of their research online, but "that there are a number of experienced attorneys, principally in smaller firms, who still prefer print and who are extremely unlikely to change their ways."&lt;ref name=Lexis /&gt;

The company representative added that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Given the ripe old ages at which many lawyers continue to practice their profession, we don’t see the market for Shepard’s in print disappearing any time soon. Clearly, subscription lists for Shepard’s products are declining as online usage grows. Attrition has been steepest in large law firms, where relatively junior associates conduct a great deal of citations research online. Attrition has been less steep in libraries and small firms where attorneys who prefer print continue to do their research. For many years, attrition in academic law libraries was relatively low. Many law school libraries continued to retain relatively substantial collections of Shepard’s in print. In recent years, attrition has increased—especially in law schools that no longer teach their students how to Shepardize in print. But because many law school libraries are open to the public (or at least to graduates of the school), including practicing attorneys in the communities they serve, a typical law school library continues to retain at least a basic collection of Shepard’s print products.&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;After Shepard’s became a part of LexisNexis, we totally redesigned the way we process case law and citations. The multi-million-dollar Citations Redesign (CR) project was intended to eliminate duplication and allow us to deliver current, accurate information unmatched by our competition. The ability to produce Shepard’s print pages quickly and efficiently was built into the CR requirements—another factor contributing to the continuing viability of Shepard’s in print.&lt;ref name=Lexis /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Online==
Today, LexisNexis users can Shepardize most citations online; cases displayed on LexisNexis bear a "''Shepardize''" link in their header and nearly always show an icon in the upper left corner of the Web page indicating the status of the case as citable authority. The icon itself, when clicked, brings up a full Shepard's report for the case.  

The report indicates exactly how later cases cited the case being Shepardized with [[plain English]] phrases like "followed by" or "overruled" rather than by using the old abbreviations.  Additionally, the report shows the full case title (that is, the names of the plaintiff and defendant) and full citation for each of the later cases.  This is important because lawyers can usually distinguish criminal from civil cases by looking at the title.  Criminal cases (with the exception of [[habeas corpus]] cases) are always titled "People v. [defendant]" or "State v. [defendant]."  Often, a criminal case may cite a civil case for a point of law which a civil litigator does not care about, and vice versa.  

Finally, the online report has the convenience of allowing the user to simply click on the [[hyperlink]] for any listed case to retrieve it instantly (if it is within the user's access plan), whereas users of Shepard's print version had to dash through long law library aisles to retrieve heavy legal [[Law report|reporter]] volumes, one for each case (and then someone had to put all those volumes back).

While most citations can be Shepardized online, there are some sources which are only Shepardizable in the print Shepard's Citations volumes. Most significant among these are the uncodified United States Statutes at Large, which are treated in the print publication ''Shepard's Federal Statute Citations'' but are not Shepardizable online. There are other more specialized sources not as widely used as the Statutes at Large that are included in print Shepard's Citations publications but not covered in the online service.

==Influences upon Science Citation Index and Google==
In 1960, [[Eugene Garfield]] developed [[Science Citation Index]] (SCI), which he later expressly acknowledged was heavily influenced in several ways by Shepard's Citations.  SCI indexes scientific journal articles, and shows what other articles they have been cited by. SCI also counts the number of citations each article gets, thus forming a citation index of the most-cited articles and journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webofstories.com/play/19446 |title=Discovering Shepard's Citations}} Interview with Eugene Garfield.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, SCI inspired several other scientists to research the possibility of developing superior citation indexes. Examples are the eigenvalue-based method developed by Gabriel Pinski and Francis Narin in 1976 and the [[PageRank]] link analysis algorithm using the similar idea created by [[Sergei Brin]] and [[Larry Page]], which became the heart of the [[Google]] search engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/sciam99.html |title=Hypersearching the Web |journal=Scientific American |date=June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Societe Le Chant du Monde v. Societe Fox Europe and Societe Fox Americaine Twentieth Century''''' is a French case had the same facts as the New York case ''[[Shostakovich v. Twentieth Century-Fox]]'', wherein four [[Russia]]n [[composer]]s sued [[Twentieth Century-Fox|Fox]] to prevent the use of their public domain compositions in an anti-[[communism|Communist]] [[film]]. The New York court presciently summed up the future holding of the French court, where it predicted that [[Moral rights (copyright law)|droit moral]] could "prevent the use of a composition or work, in the public domain." The film was ordered seized.

Russian music for many decades was in the public domain in the United States and western Europe, as a form of [[Revenge|payback]] for the [[Soviet Union]] not recognizing western [[copyright]]s.

Normally authors will be long dead before their works come into the public domain, however depending on the country there is authority that authors may dedicate their works to the [[public domain]] voluntarily. The ''Shostakovich'' and ''Le Chant du Monde'' problem, therefore is still with us. The problem is that voluntarily dedicated works may not truly be freely available for modification or even aggregation (the music in ''Le Chant du Monde'' was merely a motion picture soundtrack) until the author is dead, even though the works quite clearly are in the public domain.

This case was discussed in Strauss, ''The Moral Right of the Author'', 4 Am. J. Comp. L. 506, 534-35 n.56 (1955).

'''''Treatise on Law''''' is [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]' major work of [[philosophy of law|legal philosophy]]. It forms questions 90–108 of the ''Prima Secundæ'' ("First [Part] of the Second [Part]") of the [[Summa Theologica|''Summa Theologiæ'']],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utm.edu/staff/jfieser/vita/research/aqu.htm THE LOGIC OF NATURAL LAW IN AQUINAS'S "TREATISE ON LAW"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016223414/http://www.utm.edu/staff/jfieser/vita/research/aqu.htm |date=2013-10-16 }}&lt;br&gt;James Fieser&lt;br&gt;Journal of Philosophical Research, 1992, Vol. 17, pp. 147–164.&lt;br&gt;accessed Dec-17-2013&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas' masterwork of [[scholasticism|Scholastic]] [[philosophical theology]]. Along with [[Aristotle|Aristotelianism]], it forms the basis for the legal theory of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dr. Edward N. Peters]], [http://canonlaw.info/ CanonLaw.info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928005444/http://www.canonlaw.info/ |date=2011-09-28 }}, accessed Dec-17-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aquinas' notion of law==
Aquinas defines a law as "an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated."&lt;ref&gt;Gateway Edition, pg. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

Law is an ordinance of reason because it must be reasonable&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Law of Christ I, pg. 236&lt;/ref&gt; or based in reason and not merely in the will of the legislator.&lt;ref&gt;J. Budziszewski, [http://www.undergroundthomist.org/sites/default/files/related-documents/1-2Q90Art1.pdf ''Commentary on Treatise on Law''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219121116/http://www.undergroundthomist.org/sites/default/files/related-documents/1-2Q90Art1.pdf |date=2013-12-19 }}, accessed Dec-19-2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gateway Edition, pg. 2 (''Summa,'' Ia–IIæ, Q.90, A.1, Obj.3)&lt;/ref&gt; It is for the common good because the end or ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' of law is the good of the community it binds, and not merely the good of the lawmaker or a special interest group.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It is made by the proper authority who has "care of the community", and not arbitrarily imposed by outsiders. It is promulgated so that the law can be known.

He says: {{quote|Thus from the four preceding articles [of Question 90], the definition of law may be gathered; and it is nothing else than an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treatise_on_Law |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219002500/https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treatise_on_Law |archivedate=2013-12-19 |df= }}, accessed Dec-19-2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Strictly speaking, this is a definition of human law.&lt;ref&gt;Gateway Edition, pg. viii&lt;/ref&gt; The term "law" as used by Aquinas is [[Equivocal predication|equivocal]], meaning that the primary meaning of law is "human law", but other, analogous concepts are expressed with the same term.&lt;ref&gt;Gateway Edition, pg. x&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinds of law==

===Natural law===
[[Natural law]] or the law of nature refers to normative properties that are inherent by virtue of human nature and universally cognizable through human reason. Historically, natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze both social and personal human nature to deduce binding rules of moral behavior. The law of nature, being determined by nature, is universal.

	In the Treatise on Law, deals with Aquinas view’s on the objective ethical aspect of human decision-making. Aquinas presents a question and then puts each question into article raising specific questions he has. The first three questions are broken down in four topics what is the essence of law, the effects of law, and the eternal law.
	 The first question Ninety of Aquinas Treatise on Law is what is the essence of law? In the first question he breakdowns the question into four articles. The first article is Does Law Belong to Reason? Aquinas believes that reason is the first thing human acts upon. “And the source in any kind of thing is the measure and rule of that kind of thing…and so we conclude that law belongs to reason.” (90.1) The second is Law Always Ordained for the Common Good? We cannot find common good without reason; it guides us to common happiness through law. Happiness for the whole community. The third article is Any Person’s Reason Competent to Make Law? And the last article is Promulgation an Essential Component of Law? Promulgation is important so that the law can achieve force. By the end of the fourth article Aquinas comes up with his definition on Law, “Law is an ordination of reason for the common good by one who has care for the community, and promulgated.”(90.4) 
	Next we Next is question is Ninety-One on what are the different kinds of law? Aquinas establishes four types of laws eternal law, natural law, human law, and divine law. Eternal law “Gods providence rules the world…his reason evidently governs the entire community in the universe.” (91.1) Aquinas believes that eternal law is all gods doing. Natural law is the participation in the eternal law by rational creators. Natural law allows us to decide between good and evil. Next we have Human Law; particular applications of law resulting by reason. “Human law originally sprang from nature.” (91.3) The last law is Divine this law is important because “it belongs to any law to be directed to the common good at its end.” (91.4) Theses laws all go together and the relationship must be presented to comprehend them individually.
	Question 92 is the Effects on Laws. The first article is the Effect of Law to Make Human Beings Good? Aquinas feels in order for law to make people good that law needs to guide people to their right virtue. “Therefore, since virtue makes those possessing it good, the proper effect of law is consequently to make its subject good, either absolutely or in some respect.” (92.1) The second article of 92 is Do we Suitably Designate Legal Acts? This article focuses on what “designate legal acts consist of “commanding, forbidding, permitting, and punishing.” (92.2) Aquinas believes that some human acts are good and some are evil. 
	Question 93 focuses on the Eternal as a whole. Aquinas is asking is the eternal law the supreme plan in god? Aquinas argues whether or not if the eternal law is a plan of god. He says “God made each thing with its own nature. Therefore, the eternal law is not the same as divine plan.” (93.1) Augustine contradicts this idea by stating “the eternal law is the supreme plan that we should always obey.” (93.1) Aquinas believes that the eternal law “is simply the plan of divine wisdom that directs all the actions and movements of created things.” (93.1) He saying that god is above all else. That he creates everything in the universe. Human beings participate in eternal law in two ways by action and cognition. “The virtuous are completely subjects to the eternal law, as they always act in accord with.” (93.6) Aquinas believes people who are truthful act according to the eternal law.

===Human law===
{{see also|Determinatio}}
For Aquinas, human law is only valid if it conforms to natural law. If a law is unjust, then it is not actually a law, but a "perversion of law".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2095.htm Summa I–II, q95, a2, 'dicendum quod''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109214550/http://newadvent.org/summa/2095.htm |date=2011-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/natlaw/#H1 "Natural Law"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052718/http://www.iep.utm.edu/natlaw/ |date=2017-03-16 }}, accessed Dec-20-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SummaTheologiae.jpg|thumb|right|''Summa theologica'', Pars secunda, prima pars. (copy by Peter Schöffer, 1471)]]
The ''Treatise on Law'' (as part of the Summa Theologica) is divided into Articles (or broad topics) and Questions (or specific topics). The Questions each argue for a single thesis and defend it against objections. The division is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treatise_on_Law |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219002500/https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treatise_on_Law |archivedate=2013-12-19 |df= }}, accessed Dec-17-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lanham Act]] is the primary federal trademark statute of law in the United States&lt;ref name="Rest"/&gt; however, as it only applies to "commerce which may lawfully be regulated by Congress,"&lt;ref&gt;Quoting Lanham Act, 15 v.s.c. § 1114 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; it does not address terms that are used in foreign countries.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Witherell | first = Brendan | year = 2006 | title = Trademark Law—The Extraterritorial Application Of The Lanham Act: | journal = [[Western New England University School of Law|Western New England Law Review]] | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 204–208 | url=http://digitalcommons.law.wne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1071&amp;context=lawreview}}&lt;br /&gt;For a court to assert extraterritorial jurisdiction for the Lanham Act, (1) the conduct of the defendant must have a "substantial" effect on U.S. commerce; (2) the defendant must be a U.S. citizen; and (3) there can be no conflict with foreign law. Failing to satisfy one of the factors "might well be determinative," and "the absence of [two] is certainly fatal." &amp;mdash; Vanity Fair Mills, Inc. v. T. Eaton Co., 234 F.2d 633 (2d Cir. 1956).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Doctrine of foreign equivalents]] guideline serves this purpose.&lt;ref name="Rest"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rest | first = Elizabeth J.| year = 2006 | title = Lost in Translation: A Critical Examination of Conflicting Decisions Applying the Doctrine of Foreign Equivalents | journal = [[International Trademark Association|Trademark Reporter]] | volume = 96 | issue = 6 | pages = 1211–1212 | url=http://home.comcast.net/%7Ejlw28129/Foreign_Equivalents.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the doctrine of "foreign equivalents," a foreign language term used in a foreign country, that is considered generic in that country, cannot be imported into the United States and used as a trademark. In applying the doctrine, the courts consistently refer to two policy rationales.&lt;ref name="Chaudhri"&gt;Sujata Chaudhri [http://www.cll.com/clientuploads/pdfs/Chaudhri_article_JanFeb2007.pdf Trademark Doctrine of Foreign Equivalents] Cowan, Liebowitz &amp; Latman pg 1&lt;/ref&gt; The first rationale, "the doctrine serves the interests of domestic competition":&lt;ref name="Chaudhri"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Because of the diversity of the population of the United States, coupled with temporary visitors, all of whom are part of the United States marketplace, commerce in the United States utilizes innumerable foreign languages. No merchant may obtain the exclusive right over a trademark registration if that exclusivity would prevent competitors from designating a product as what it is in the language their customers know best." &amp;mdash; Otokoyama Co. Ltd. Vs Wine of Japan Import Inc.&lt;ref name="Chaudhri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/175/175.F3d.266.html Otokoyama Co. Ltd. Vs Wine of Japan Import Inc. 175 F. 3D. 266,271 (2nd Circuit 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The second rationale, "the doctrine serves the interests of international [[comity]]":&lt;ref name="Chaudhri"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Because United States companies would be hamstrung in international trade if foreign countries granted trademark protection to generic English words, the United States reciprocates and refuses trademark protection to generic foreign words." &amp;mdash; Enrique Bernat F., S.A. v. Guadalajara, Inc.&lt;ref name="Chaudhri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/210/210.F3d.439.99-50854.html Enrique Bernat F., S.A. v. Guadalajara, Inc., 210 F.3d 439 (5th Cir. 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, the [[Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure]] ("TMEP") states that the test for applying the doctrine of foreign equivalents is "whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would denote its English equivalent".&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/resources/exam/examguide1_08.jsp Guidance on when to apply the doctrine of foreign equivalents. Examination Guide 1-08] [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] April 23, 2008&lt;br /&gt;The [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] has, for the purposes of the guide, ruled that an "ordinary American purchaser" refers to the "significant portion of consumers" who speak both English and the relevant foreign language. In the case ''In re Joint Stock Co. "Baik ," 80 USPQ2d 1305, 1310,'' 0.22% was accepted as a significant portion of consumers in the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaudhri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TMEP 1207.01(b)(vi)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the doctrine is generally interpreted by courts as not applying if the generic word is not a word from a foreign language, but one from an English-speaking foreign country.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;For foreign countries in which English is the primary language, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the generic status of an English-language term in that country was "irrelevant to the question [of] whether it should be accorded the same status in America" and carried no weight. Similarly, a California court has held that the "genericness" of an English-language term in an English-speaking foreign country "was not determinative of the alleged genericness of that term in the United States." &amp;mdash; Rest Elizabeth J. (2006), Lost in Translation: pg. 1244 + 1246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;[http://www.bitlaw.com/source/tmep/1207_01.html Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure § 1207.01: 1207.01(b)(vi) Doctrine of Foreign Equivalents]&lt;br /&gt;"The doctrine should be applied '''only''' when it is likely that the ordinary American purchaser would stop and translate the foreign word into its English equivalent."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koolaburra"/&gt;

Court cases have noted that the generic status accorded to English-language words in foreign countries has no bearing on the registration of marks in the United States. The genericity argument was invoked for Ugg boots and was rejected by a U.S. district court which cited the following cases in support.&lt;ref name="Koolaburra"/&gt; In ''Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co.'', the court rejected as irrelevant the generic usage of the phrase "L.A. beer" in Australia for [[low-alcohol beer]].&lt;ref name="Koolaburra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anheuser"&gt;''[https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/750/750.F2d.631.84-1714.html Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co.'', 750 F.2d 631, 641-42 (8th Cir. 1984).]&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled that "a term may be generic in one country and suggestive in another"&lt;ref name="Stroh"/&gt; and that genericity in Australia was irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co. B92&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Carcione v. The Greengrocer, Inc.'', the court rejected as irrelevant the generic use of the term "[[Greengrocer]]" in most English speaking countries for a retailer of fruit. The court rejected the argument on the grounds that it is irrelevant how a term is used outside the United States:&lt;ref name="Stroh"&gt;''Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co. C42&lt;/ref&gt; "The parties agree that the term is generic in Britain. Since we deal here with American trademark law, and thus American consumers, neither British usage nor the dictionary definition indicating such usage are determinative." &lt;ref name="Koolaburra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Carcione v. The Greengrocer, Inc.'', 205 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 1075 (E.D. Cal. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; In another case, the court stated that while a term may be generic in another country, if "it is not so recognized in this country [the U.S.]... the mark must still be regarded as arbitrary and fanciful in the United States." and thus remains eligible for registration as a trademark in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Seiko Sporting Goods USA, Inc. v. Kabushiki Kaisha Hattori Tokeiten'', 545 F. Supp. 221, 226 (S.D.N.Y. 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

As the doctrine is a guideline rather than a rule, it has been criticized with commentators noting that United States courts are often contradictory and inconsistent in their application of the doctrine, and that it provides little guidance to owners when choosing their marks or to courts when assessing protectability or likelihood of mark confusion.&lt;ref name="Rest"/&gt; It has been suggested by the [[International Trademark Association]] that the doctrine be abolished and replaced with one that applies equally to all foreign words, regardless of whether they are from a foreign language or an English language, and that they take into account that country's trademark laws. Under the proposed changes, "Terms that are generic are never protectible as trademarks and are never registerable".&lt;ref&gt;Rest Elizabeth J. (2006), Lost in Translation: pg. 1221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Serge Krimnus, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1734567 The Doctrine of Foreign Equivalents at Death's Door], 12 N.C.

The UGG trademark has been the subject of dispute in several countries. The trademark for "Ugh-Boots" has been removed from the trademark registry in Australia for non-use.&lt;ref name="UggHowAMinnow" /&gt; Outside Australia and New Zealand, [[UGG Australia|UGG]] (''written in capital letters'') is a registered [[trademark]] of [[Deckers Outdoor Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Koolaburra"&gt;{{cite web | last =  | first =  | date = February 23, 2005 | title = United States District Court UGG Holdings, Inc. -v- Clifford Severen et al | work = [[Deckers Outdoor Corporation]] | url = http://www.deckers.com/ugg-is-a-brand/LegalDecisions/Koolaburra_decision.pdf | accessdate = 12 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, an Australian surfer, Shane Steadman, registered the name "UGH-BOOTS" as a trademark in Australia and began selling sheepskin boots under that name. In 1982 he registered the name "UGH" and a logo containing a stylised Sun with the words "UGG AUSTRALIA".&lt;ref name="Hynes"/&gt; In 1979, Brian Smith, another Australian surfer, applied to be the United States distributor for Country Leather, a [[West Australia|Western Australian]] manufacturer of ugg boots, and began selling their Australian-made boots in New York and to surfers in California.&lt;ref name="UggLove"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/20/image/la-ig-ugg20-2009dec20 |title=It looks like Ugg love |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=20 December 2009 |author=Julie Neigher |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 he set up Ugg Holdings Inc. and in 1995 purchased the trademarks from Steadman. In 1996 he sold his interest to Deckers and in 1999 Deckers registered the trademarks for "UGG" in the US and 25 foreign countries.&lt;ref name="Hynes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTOREF5"&gt;Fink, Karl V.; Johnson, Carolyn M.; Miranda, David P.

Paul Barclay d/b/a Australian Made Goods"], National Arbitration Forum, retrieved August 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deckers.com/ugg-is-a-brand/factFictionTable.html UGG is a brand. Fact and Fiction.] [[Deckers Outdoor Corporation]]&lt;/ref&gt; Deckers began asserting its new trademark and sent out [[cease and desist]] letters to Australian manufacturers who were using the name ugg for their boots but otherwise took little action.&lt;ref name="UggHowAMinnow" /&gt; In the early 2000s, demand for ugg boots was soaring, partly as a result of US$8 million spent on marketing by Deckers, but also due to several celebrity endorsements.&lt;ref name="UggHowAMinnow" /&gt;

For the nine months to September 2004, UGG boots sales totaled $39.2 million, an increase of 180% over the previous year. Plans were also in place to expand the [[UGG Australia|UGG brand]] to cover hats, scarves and gloves.&lt;ref name="PR 2004" &gt;[http://www.deckers.com/investors/press-releases/press-detail?releaseid=633831 Press Release] Deckers October 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; With the continuing rise in popularity, Deckers now began a serious effort to halt the use of the name "ugg" by other manufacturers. Deckers' law firm, Middletons of [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]], sent cease and desist letters to a number of Australian and American manufacturers who were selling uggs over the Internet, preventing them from selling uggs on [[eBay]] or from using the word in their [[domain name]]s or registered business names.&lt;ref name="AUTOREF6"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Arnold|first=James|title=Aussie boot battle takes an Uggly turn|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3495511.stm|accessdate=23 August 2010|newspaper=BBC News Online|date=19 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image: Ugg boots gnangarra 01.JPG |right|250px|thumb|[[Uggs-N-Rugs]] factory in [[Kenwick, Western Australia]]]]
The manufacture of ugg boots in Australia was primarily a [[Putting-out system#Cottage industry|cottage industry]]. Individually lacking the resources to fight Deckers, 20 Australian manufacturers formed the Australian Sheepskin Association to fight the corporation's claim, arguing that "ugg" is a generic term referring to flat-heeled, pull-on sheepskin boots.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, James [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3495511.stm Aussie boot battle takes an Uggly turn] [[BBC News]] February 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIM"&gt;[http://www.aim.com.au/DisplayStory.asp?ID=542 Taking On The Big Guys Is Never an Easy Task] [[Australian Institute of Management]] April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; They further argued that Australian manufacturers had been making and trading this style of boot for decades, including exporting them to the US. One of these manufacturers, [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth's]] [[Uggs-N-Rugs]], who had been manufacturing uggs since 1978 and selling them online since 1996, appealed to Australian trademark regulators, [[IP Australia]].&lt;ref name="UggHowAMinnow" /&gt; The officer who heard the case stated that the "evidence overwhelmingly supports the proposition that the terms (ugg, ugh and ug boots) are interchangeably used to describe a specific style of sheepskin boot and are the first and most natural way in which to describe these goods." In 2006 Uggs-N-Rugs won the right to use the term UGG BOOT/S and variations such as UGH BOOT/S.&lt;ref name="UggHowAMinnow" /&gt; The case was the subject of a 2006 television [[documentary film|documentary]], ''The Good, The Bad and The Ugg Boot''.&lt;ref name="GoodBadAndUggBoot"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Good, The Bad, and The Ugg boot |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/netw/200609/programs/ZY7714A001D14092006T203000.htm |credits=Produced and directed by Susan Lambert, Jumping Dog Productions |network=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |airdate=14 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deckers retained the rights to their UGG logo as trade mark protection only applies for the way the mark appears in its entirety and not for the words it contains. The name Ugg/UGG was determined to be generic after the Registrar of Trade Marks found that registration did not confer "rights in the generic term, or terms, from which it is derived" and that the identity of the various trade marks "derive from the hyphenated nature of the expression." Therefore, ''UGH boots, UG boots'' and ''UGG boots'' ("or other variations") without hyphens are all generic terms in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Decision of the delegate of the Registrar of Trade Marks with reasons. January 16, 2006 pg 10 - 11&lt;/ref&gt; IP Australia also ruled that the trademark "UGH-boots" (with hyphen) should be removed from the trademark register for non-use as Deckers had only been using the UGG logo, not the UGH marks.&lt;ref name="UggHowAMinnow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hynes" /&gt; Deckers initially declined to pay Uggs-N-Rugs court costs as required by the 2006 ruling.&lt;ref name="terry2008p188"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Where's the Beef?

In 1998, Deckers demanded that the American company [[Koolaburra]] cease infringing the UGG trademark. Koolaburra replied that they did not use the name "UGG" or "UGH" and that the only mark they used was "Ug". Deckers sent a further "cease and desist" letter in 2001 and another in 2003 but Koolaburra declined to stop using the name "Ug" and in 2004, Deckers filed a case against Koolaburra in the California federal court alleging (1) trademark infringement, (2) false designation of origin (Koolaburra labelled their boots "Australian Ug Boots"), (3) trademark dilution, (4) [[cybersquatting]], (5) unfair competition, (6) trade disparagement, (7) unjust enrichment and (8) breach of contract (Deckers claimed that in 1998 Koolaburra had agreed to stop using the name Ug). Koolaburra in turn challenged that the name UGG was generic and not entitled to trademark protection. As the UGG mark was registered, Deckers was entitled to the assumption that it was not generic, thus the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] rested with Koolaburra.&lt;ref name="Koolaburra"/&gt;

In support, Koolaburra provided the testimony of America's National Surfing Team coach [[Peter Townend (surfer)|Peter Townend]] and [[Nordstrom]]'s footwear buyer Heather Kolkey. These declarations were accepted by the court as anecdotal. Additionally, Koolaburra provided three instances of the generic usage of Ugg in American magazines, however the court pointed out that the most recent was dated 1980. Koolaburra also quoted the [[New York City]] published [[Oxford English Dictionary]] definition of "Ugg"; however, this was rejected after Deckers petitioned the Dictionary to change the definition of "Ugg" from "a kind of soft sheepskin boot" to a definition that included UGG's trademark, which the OED agreed to do.&lt;ref name="Koolaburra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;[http://magazine.wsj.com/features/behind-the-brand/the-golden-fleece/ Behind the Brand: The Golden Fleece] [[Wall Street Journal]] September 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Koolaburra then argued that the UGG trademark was invalid as Brian Smith had fraudulently registered the name by giving false representations that the term was not generic, arguing that "as an Australian citizen, Smith knew of the fact that the term Ugg was a generic term". This was rejected by the court as fraud requires an applicant to "knowingly" make the false representations, ruling that such belief was subjective, and finding that even if Smith knew the term was generic in Australia, he may have "honestly held [a] good faith belief" that it was not generic in the United States.&lt;ref name="Koolaburra"/&gt;

Deckers countered through submitting declarations from four professionals in the footwear industry who stated that "UGG" is widely recognized in the industry as a brand name, not a generic term and provided the court with survey evidence supporting that consumers in the US consider UGG to be a brand name; among women aged 18 to 45 who had purchased footwear valued over $100 in the last 12 months, 58% believed UGG was a brand name while only 11% thought it generic. Koolaburra then argued that the term was generic under the doctrine of "foreign equivalents" (Under U.S. law, a term used in another country that is considered generic in that country cannot be imported into the United States and used as a trademark). This was rejected as the doctrine only applied to terms in a foreign language.&lt;ref name="Koolaburra"/&gt; In February 2005, the court ruled for Deckers on their claims of "trademark infringement" and "unfair competition", finding that a consumer would likely be confused with the similarity in "appearance, sight and sound" between "Ug" and UGG" as the parties were marketing in direct competition with identical products. However, the court declined to rule on the validity of trademarks in Australia as it was considered inappropriate to interfere with another country's rulings.&lt;ref name="Koolaburra"/&gt;

The Australian Sheepskin Association is attempting to change the name UGG into a regional mark similar to that achieved for [[Champagne]] which would negate its trademark status in many jurisdictions. Deckers in response has focused on the fact that its UGG boots are made in China and not Australia.&lt;ref name="az"&gt;[http://azrightstrademarkregistration.co.uk/category/international-trademarks/ UGG Trademark Disputes] Azrights Solicitors. London April 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, sales of Deckers UGG boots totaled over US$630 million while the UGG brand, which now includes hats, scarves, gloves, slippers, casuals, jackets, coats, and handbags&lt;ref name="PR 2004" /&gt; totaled over US$1 billion with 30% of sales outside of the United States.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt;

===Trademark infringement cases===
*During a [[counterfeit|trademark infringement]] and [[trade dress]] case in 2008, a generic term defense was rejected by a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] court as not being applicable to counterfeit goods. The court also rejected La Cheapa's claim that as Australian companies believe "ugg" was a generic name, the "UGG AUSTRALIA" mark was not protected in the Benelux, noting that La Cheapa also admitted knowing that UGG in the Benelux is a famous brand which undermined their argument that UGG was generic.&lt;ref name="Dutch"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Verdict: Case number / Docket number: 74950 / HA ZA 08-2234]| url = http://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBDOR:2008:BG8866 | publisher = Court Dordrecht | date = December 24, 2008 |language = nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; La Cheapa distributed sheepskin boots it had purchased from a supplier in China on an Internet site from the Netherlands, describing them on its website as "100% authentic Ugg Australian boots!!!", with "UGG logo on the heel" and in boxes virtually identical to Deckers packaging. These were found by the court to be counterfeits. The Deckers case had also included La Cheapa's sale of imported boots manufactured by Jumbo Ugg Boots Binder Production Pty Ltd in [[Melbourne]], Australia branded ''Jumbo Uggs.'' The court stated that "given the exact similarity of the goods (namely: boots)" and the fact that the word "ugg" was part of the brand, and the undisputed fact that the "UGG brand" was popular in the [[Benelux]], it found that the importation and distribution of sheepskin boots which contained the word "ugg" in its label took an "unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character of the brand UGG" and was thus an infringement of the Deckers trademark.&lt;ref name="Dutch"/&gt;
*On December 25, 2010, Deckers filed a trademark infringement suit in a bid to stop [[Emu Australia]] from using the UGG name on its sales website. On December 30 Emu Australia counter-sued for the cancellation of Deckers' UGG trademark in the US. Emu's suit alleged that Deckers' trademark was obtained after a false statement to the US Patent and Trademark Office and was therefore invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shoefaironline.com.au/blog/The-battle-of-the-uggs |title=The battle of the uggs |work=Shoe Fair Online |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 August 2011, the case was [[Res judicata|dismissed with prejudice]] by stipulation of the parties but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.law360.com/ip/articles/267597 |title=Deckers, Emu Resolve Ugg Trademark Suit |work=Law360.com |date=26 August 2011 |accessdate=7 September 2011 |first=Megan |last=Leonhardt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.just-style.com/news/emu-and-deckers-reach-settlement-over-ugg-name_id112044.aspx |title=Emu and Deckers reach settlement over Ugg name |work=Just-Style.com |date=26 August 2011 |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2010, the validity of the UGG trademark was challenged in a Turkish court by a local manufacturer after his application to register a trademark containing the words UGGBOOTS and AUSTRALIA was rejected. Judge Verda Çiçekli ruled for Deckers, finding that UGG was not a generic term and did not have any descriptive nature in the Turkish language, except to refer to Deckers products.&lt;ref name="Turkish"/&gt; The court further ruled that UGG was a well-known trademark that has gained recognition and distinctiveness worldwide, and while acknowledging the challenger's allegations that UGG was a generic term in Australia, ruled that such alleged facts have no bearing on the validity of the trademark within Turkey.&lt;ref name="Turkish"/&gt; Deckers was also awarded costs in the action.
*In 2010, [[IP Australia]] ruled on the trademark opposition dispute between Deckers and Luda Production Pty Ltd, granting Luda the right to register the trademarks UGG AUSTRALIA (&amp; Design) and MADE BY UGG AUSTRALIA with costs awarded against Deckers. Luda declared that the "element ugg" was used generically in the sheepskin boot market but that its use had not caused any confusion with Luda's UGG AUSTRALIA products. Luda began manufacturing ugg boots in 1981 and in 1982 began selling its boots with woven heel counters featuring the UGG AUSTRALIA mark. In 1984, the company was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] at which time Luda had attempted to trademark its ''UGG AUSTRALIA'' logo but was asked by the Trade Mark Office not to proceed as the name was "descriptive" and was therefore not registerable.&lt;ref name="Freehills"&gt;[http://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/-/media/Freehills/A0802112%2021%2025.PDF UGG AUSTRALIA: fight over trade mark registration continues] Freehills Patent &amp; Trade Mark Attorneys February 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Luda filed another trademark application after becoming aware of "other products being sold bearing variations of the element UGG" in conjunction with the word "Australia." Deckers opposed the application on three grounds, prior use (Deckers argued that the prior use shown by Luda was invalid as the mark they sought to register was not "an exact copy" of the mark they used), that Deckers had a more significant reputation in Australia and that Luda had filed the application in bad faith. The court found that Deckers did not have a significant reputation in an Australian market which was dominated by Luda Productions, and thus failed the requirements of the Trade Practices Act, regarding public misapprehension of the origin of the manufacturer. The court noted that Luda's use of the term "UGG AUSTRALIA" predated Deckers' infringement defense by 22 years, which negated Deckers' claim that Luda was trading upon their reputation and that Luda had not filed in bad faith, but in order to gain statutory protection for trade marks already recognized in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Windsor | first = Alison | title = Decision of a Delegate of the Registrar of Trade Marks with Reasons | publisher = IP Australia | date = September 29, 2010 | url = http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/pdfs/trademarks/hearings/1013798-2010.pdf | accessdate = November 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/ipad/dont-feel-sheepish-about-your-uggies/story-fn6bqphm-1226013106074 Don't feel sheepish about your uggies] [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] February 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding a non-use action between Deckers and Luda Production Pty, IP Australia confirmed that Deckers owned the trademark of their UGG AUSTRALIA label (with sun-like device), however the scope of Deckers' trademark was narrowed, restricted to just footwear.&lt;ref name="IPAus"/&gt;
*In 2011, Deckers filed suit against the [[China|Chinese]] company [[Dangdang]] for allegedly selling counterfeit Uggs at the Jingdong Mall and on [[Taobao]], a Chinese language website similar to [[eBay]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]. Known as "snow boots" in China, Dangdang had been selling Australian made boots labeled ''Merino World UGG.'' In defense, a spokesperson from Jingdong Mall argued that the boots were a different brand to Deckers with the letters in the word "UGG" designed differently. In support, he cited [[Baidu Baike]], the Chinese online [[encyclopedia]], which describes ''Ugg'' as a generic term for sheepskin boots. Asked to comment, the media and public relations Manager of the [[Austrade|Australian Trade Commission]] attached to the Australian Embassy in [[Shanghai]], Anthony-Yan stated that the snow boots style originated in Australia where all such boots are referred to as UGG boots. The Australian manufacturers' logos contained the word "UGG" in large block letters on the heel of the boot, and the court found that this practice deceived the ordinary consumer.&lt;ref name="Zhao Blue"&gt;[http://www.daanba.com/mynews/shangbiaoxinwen/7197.html "Ugg" snow boots trademark dispute.] Daanba.com (Chinese language website of Zhao Blue trademarks law firm.) "The difference between the two [logos] is subtle ... enough to mislead the public."&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled that use of the word "ugg" in Chinese commerce was an infringement of the Deckers Chinese "UGG" trademark, and held the manufacturers and distribution firms liable.&lt;ref name="Zhao Blue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PClady" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[Shanghai]] suburb of [[Gaoqiao, Shanghai|Gaoqiao]] is the nation's largest production base for ''snow boots'' with more than 200 businesses manufacturing footwear valued at more than 1 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] (US$163 million) annually; it is also "the nation's largest production base for imitation UGG brands," with an estimated 150 companies producing counterfeit UGGs.&lt;ref name="PClady" /&gt; Deckers UGG boots cost from 1,500 to 8,000 yuan (US$240 to US$1,300) in China when demand exceeded supply in 2011, which led to a large market for both counterfeit UGGs and the lower priced uggs imported from Australia.&lt;ref name="PClady"&gt;[http://dress.pclady.com.cn/meise/1112/775678.html UGG trademark dispute creates industry market chaos.] ''PClady'' magazine (Chinese language website), December 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States presidential line of succession''' is the [[order of succession|order]] in which officials of the [[United States]] [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] discharge the powers and duties of the office of [[President of the United States]] if the [[incumbent]] president becomes [[Capacity (law)|incapacitated]], dies, resigns, or is removed from office (by [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] by the [[House of Representatives of the United States|House of Representatives]] and subsequent [[conviction]] by the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]]) during their four-year term of office. Presidency succession is referred to multiple times in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]{{snd}}[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Vacancy and disability|Article II, Section 1, Clause 6]], as well as the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]], [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|20th Amendment]], and [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]]. The Article II succession clause authorizes [[United States Congress|Congress]] to provide for a line of succession beyond the vice president, which it has done on three occasions. The current [[Presidential Succession Act]] was adopted in 1947, and last revised in 2006.

The line of succession follows the order of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]], [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]], and then the eligible heads of [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive departments]] who form the president's [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]]. The Presidential Succession Act refers specifically to officers beyond the vice president ''acting as'' president rather than ''becoming'' president when filling a vacancy. The Cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the [[Secretary of State of the United States|Secretary of State]] is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those heads of department who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. Since 1789, the vice president has succeeded to the presidency intra-term on nine occasions, eight times due to the incumbent's death, and once due to resignation. No one lower in the line of succession has yet been called upon to act as president.

Widely considered a settled issue during the late 20th century, the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]] demonstrated the potential for a [[decapitation strike]] that would kill or incapacitate multiple individuals in the presidential line of succession, in addition to many members of Congress and of the federal judiciary. In the years immediately following the attacks, there were numerous wide-ranging discussions in Congress among academics, and within the public policy community about [[continuity of government]] concerns, including the existing constitutional and statutory provisions governing presidential succession. These discussions are ongoing. One effort, that of the [[Continuity of Government Commission]], a [[Nonpartisanism in the United States|nonpartisan]] [[think tank]], produced three reports (in 2003, 2009, and 2011), the second of which focused on the implicit ambiguities and limitations in the current succession act, and contained recommendations for amending the laws for succession to the presidency.

== Current order ==

The table below details the current presidential order of succession as established by the 1947 presidential succession [[statute]] as amended ({{usc|3|19}}).&lt;ref name=CNN10242017&gt;{{cite news|title=Succession: Presidential and Vice Presidential Fast Facts|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/27/us/succession-presidential-and-vice-presidential-fast-facts/index.html|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.|website=CNN.com|date=August 27, 2013|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order is determined by the offices. However, the individual in an office must still satisfy the constitutional requirements for the office in order to serve as Acting President.

== Constitutional provisions ==

=== Presidential eligibility ===
[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article II, Section 1, Clause 5]] of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must: be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen]] of the United States; be at least thirty-five years old; and be a [[Residency (domicile)#United States|resident in the United States]] for at least fourteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article II.

A person who meets the above qualifications, however, would still be constitutionally disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:

=== Presidential succession ===
The presidential line of succession is mentioned at four places in the Constitution: 
*Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 makes the vice president first in the line of succession and allows the [[United States Congress|Congress]] to provide by law for cases in which neither the president nor vice president can serve.&lt;ref name=A2essayPS&gt;{{cite web| last=Feerick| first=John| title=Essays on Article II: Presidential Succession| work=The Heritage Guide to the Constitution| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/83/presidential-succession| publisher=The Heritage Foundation| accessdate=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]] includes a statement clarifying that, just as they would due to the president's death or disability, the powers and duties of the presidency devolve to the vice president if—following a presidential election where no candidate won an absolute majority of votes in the Electoral College—the House of Representatives has been unable to [[Contingent election|elect]] a president by the scheduled beginning of the president's term.&lt;ref name=Feerick2011FLR&gt;{{cite journal| last=Feerick| first=John D.| date=2011| title=Presidential Succession and Inability: Before and After the Twenty-Fifth Amendment| url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4695&amp;context=flr| journal=Fordham Law Review| volume=79| issue=3| pages=907–949| accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|20th Amendment]], Section 3, supersedes the above 12th Amendment provision, by declaring that if the [[President-elect of the United States|president-elect]] dies before his term begins, the vice president-elect becomes president on [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]] and serves for the full term to which the president-elect was elected, and also that, if on Inauguration Day, a president has not been chosen or the president-elect does not qualify for the presidency, the vice president-elect acts as president until a president is chosen or the president-elect qualifies. It also authorizes Congress to provide for instances in which neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect have qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Twentieth Amendment| last1=Larson| first1=Edward J.| last2=Shesol| first2=Jeff| url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xx| work=The Interactive Constitution| publisher=The National Constitution Center| location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania| accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]], Section 1, clarifies Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, by stating unequivocally that the vice president is the direct successor of the president, and becomes president if the incumbent dies, resigns or is removed from office. It also, in sections 3 and 4, provides for situations where the president is temporarily disabled, such as if the president has a surgical procedure or becomes mentally unfit, establishing procedures whereby the Vice President can become [[Acting President of the United States|acting president]]. Additionally, in Section 2, the amendment provides a mechanism for intra-term vice presidential succession, establishing that vice presidential vacancies will be filled by the president and confirmed by both houses of Congress.{{efn-ua|This section 2 of the 25th Amendment has been invoked twice: {{Nowrap|1973—}}[[Gerald Ford]] was [[United States vice presidential selection, 1973|nominated and confirmed]] to office following [[Spiro Agnew]]'s resignation. {{Nowrap|1974—}}[[Nelson Rockefeller]] was [[United States vice presidential selection, 1974|nominated and confirmed]] to office after Gerald Ford became president upon [[Richard Nixon]]'s resignation.&lt;ref name=CRSsuccession05&gt;{{cite web| last=Neale| first=Thomas H.| title=Presidential and Vice Presidential Succession: Overview and Current Legislation|page=5| work=CRS Report for Congress| url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL31761.pdf| publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]], the [[Library of Congress]]| location=Washington, D.C.| date=September 27, 2004| accessdate=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Previously, whenever a vice president had succeeded to the presidency or had died or resigned from office, the vice presidency remained vacant until the next presidential and vice presidential terms began; there were 16 such vacancies prior to 1967.&lt;ref name=NCC25th&gt;{{cite web| title=The Twenty-fifth Amendment| last1=Kalt| first1=Brian C.| last2=Pozen| first2=David| url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxv| work=The Interactive Constitution| publisher=The National Constitution Center| location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania| accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Succession acts ==
{{Main|Presidential Succession Act}}

===Act of 1792===
The Presidential Succession Act of 1792 ({{Cws |title=Full text |link=Presidential Succession Act 1792 |nobullet=yes}}) provided for succession to the presidency, in the event both the office of the President and the Vice President were vacant, by, first, the president pro tempore of the Senate, followed by, if need be, the speaker of the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://time.com/4071416/house-speaker-presidential-succession/| title=America's System for Presidential Succession is Ridiculous| last=Spivak| first=Joshua| date=October 14, 2015| publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''| accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various framers of the Constitution, such as [[James Madison]], criticized the arrangement as being contrary to their intent. The decision to build the line of succession around those two officials was made after a long and contentious debate. In addition to the president pro tempore and the speaker, both the secretary of state and the [[Chief Justice of the United States|chief justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] were also suggested. Including the secretary of state was unacceptable to most [[Federalist Party|Federalists]], who did not want the then secretary of state, [[Thomas Jefferson]], who had become the leader of the opposition [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]], to follow the vice president in the succession, and many objected to including the chief justice due to [[separation of powers]] concerns.&lt;ref name=A2essayPS/&gt;&lt;ref name=65FFH5762&gt;{{cite book| title=From Failing Hands: the Story of Presidential Succession| last1=Feerick| first1=John D.| last2=Freund| first2=Paul A.| date=1965| url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=twentyfifth_amendment_books| publisher=Fordham University Press| location=New York City| pages=57–62| lccn=65-14917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statute provided that the presidential successor would serve in an acting capacity, holding office only until a new president could be elected.&lt;ref name=CRS2005continuity&gt;{{cite web| last=Relyea| first=Harold C.| title=Continuity of Government: Current Federal Arrangements and the Future| work=CRS Report for Congress| url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/secrecy/RS21089.pdf| publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]], the [[Library of Congress]]| location=Washington, D.C.| pages=2–4| date=August 5, 2005| accessdate=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special election was to be held in November of the year in which dual vacancies occurred (unless the vacancies occurred after the first Wednesday in October, in which case the election would occur the following year; or unless the vacancies occurred within the last year of the presidential term, in which case the next election would take place as regularly scheduled). The persons elected president and vice president in such a special election would have served a full four-year term beginning on March 4 of the next year; no such election ever took place.

===Act of 1886===
The Presidential Succession Act of 1886 ({{Cws |title=Full text |link=Presidential Succession Act 1886 |nobullet=yes}}) established a line of succession that included the members of the president's cabinet, the order of the establishment of the various departments, beginning with the Secretary of State,{{efn-ua|Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of War, Attorney-General, Postmaster-General, Secretary of the Navy, and Secretary of the Interior.}} and stipulated that any official discharging the powers and duties of the presidency must possess the constitutional qualifications to hold the office.&lt;ref name=CRS2005continuity/&gt; The president pro tempore and speaker were excluded from the new line; also dropped was the provision mandating a special presidential election when a double vacancy arose.

The need for increasing the number of presidential successors was abundantly clear to Congress, for twice within the span of four years it happened that there was no one in the presidential line of succession. In September 1881, When [[Chester A. Arthur]] succeeded to the presidency following [[James A. Garfield]]'s death, there was no vice President, no president pro tempore of the Senate, and no Speaker of the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=Feerick2011FLR/&gt; Then, in November 1885, [[Grover Cleveland]] faced a similar situation, following the death of Vice President [[Thomas A. Hendricks]], as the Senate and the House had not convened yet to elect new officers.&lt;ref name="harpers"&gt;{{cite book |title=Harper's Book of Facts: a Classified History of the World; Embracing Science, Literature, and Art |last=Lewis |first=Charlton Thomas |last2=Willsey |first2=Joseph H. |year=1895 |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |location=New York |page=884 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcwGAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA884&amp;dq=why%20did%20cleveland%20change%20line%20of%20succession%201885&amp;pg=PA884#v=snippet&amp;q=country%20without%20any%20one%20in%20the%20line%20of%20succession&amp;f=false |accessdate=April 24, 2011 |lccn=01020386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Act of 1947 ===
The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 ({{Cws |title=Full text |link=Presidential Succession Act 1947 |nobullet=yes}}) restored the speaker of the House and president pro tempore of the Senate to the line of succession—but in reverse-order from their 1792 positions—and placed them ahead of the members of the Cabinet, who were positioned once more in the order of the establishment of their department.&lt;ref name=wftvAPOTUS/&gt;{{efn-ua|Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of War, Attorney General, Postmaster General, Secretary of the Navy, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor.}} Placing the speaker and the president pro tempore (both elected officials) back in the succession and placing them ahead of cabinet members (all of whom are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate), was [[Harry S. Truman]]'s idea. Personally conveyed to Congress in June 1945, two months after becoming president upon [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s death, the proposal reflected Truman's belief that the president should not have the power to appoint to office "the person who would be my immediate successor in the event of my own death or inability to act," and that the presidency should, whenever possible, "be filled by an elective officer."&lt;ref name=CRS2005continuity/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Truman| first=Harry S.| title=Special Message to the Congress on the Succession to the Presidency| date=June 19, 1945| others=Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

The Act, which the president signed into law on July 18, 1947,&lt;ref name=CRS2005continuity/&gt; has been modified several times, with changes being made as the face of the federal bureaucracy has changed over the ensuing years.

== Ambiguities regarding succession and inability ==

[[Image:John Tyler.jpg|thumb|upright=.80|In April 1841, [[John Tyler]] became the first person to succeed to the presidency intra-term upon the death of [[William Henry Harrison]].]]
Although the Presidential Succession Clause in Article II of the Constitution clearly provided for the vice president to take over the "powers and duties" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability, left unclear was whether the vice president became president of the United States or simply [[Interim|temporarily acted]] as president in a case of succession.&lt;ref name=A2essayPS/&gt; Some historians, including [[Edward Samuel Corwin|Edward Corwin]] and [[John Feerick|John D. Feerick]],&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"/&gt; have argued that the framers' intention was that the vice president would remain vice president while executing the powers and duties of the presidency until a new president could be elected.&lt;ref name=justiaPS&gt;{{cite web| url=https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-2/05-presidential-succession.html| title=Presidential Succession| work=US Law| publisher=Justia| location=Mountain View, California| accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothetical debate about whether the office or merely the powers of the office devolve upon a vice president who succeeds to the presidency between elections became an urgent constitutional issue in 1841, when President William Henry Harrison died in office, only {{age in days|Mar 4, 1841|Apr 4, 1841}} days into his term. Vice President [[John Tyler]] claimed a constitutional mandate to carry out the full powers and duties of the presidency, asserting he was the president and not merely a temporary [[Acting President of the United States|acting president]], by taking the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath of office]].&lt;ref name=JTDA&gt;{{cite web| title=John Tyler: Domestic Affairs| last=Freehling| first=William| url=https://millercenter.org/president/tyler/domestic-affairs| publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| location=Charllotesville, Virginia| accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the precedent regarding presidential succession due to the president's death was set, the part of the Presidential Succession Clause that provided for replacing a disabled president remained unclear. What constituted an "inability"? Who determined the existence of an inability? Did a vice president become president for the rest of the presidential term in the case of an inability; or was the vice president merely "acting as President"?  Due to this lack of clarity, later vice presidents were hesitant to assert any role in cases of presidential inability.&lt;ref name=XXVHeritage&gt;{{cite web| title=Essays on Amendment XXV: Presidential Succession| work=The Heritage Guide to the Constitution| last=Feerick| first=John| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/amendments/25/essays/187/presidential-succession| publisher=The Heritage Foundation| accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two situations are noteworthy:

* On July 2, 1881, [[James Garfield]] was shot; hit from behind by two bullets (one grazing his arm and the other lodging in his back).&lt;ref name=65FFH11827&gt;{{cite book| title=From Failing Hands: the Story of Presidential Succession| last1=Feerick| first1=John D.| last2=Freund| first2=Paul A.| date=1965| url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=twentyfifth_amendment_books| publisher=Fordham University Press| location=New York City| pages=118–127| lccn=65-14917}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president wavered between life and death for 80 days after the shooting; it was the first time that the nation as a whole experienced the uncertainties associated with a prolonged period of presidential inability.&lt;ref name=Feerick2011FLR/&gt; Most disconcerting, especially for [[Garfield administration]] personnel and members of Congress, was the lack of constitutional guidance on how to handle the situation. No one was sure who, if anyone, should exercise presidential authority while the president was disabled; many urged Vice President [[Chester Arthur]] to step-up, but he declined, fearful of being labeled a usurper. Aware that he was in a delicate position and that his every action was placed under scrutiny, Arthur remained secluded in his [[Chester A. Arthur Home|New York City home]] for most of the summer. Members of the Garfield Cabinet conferred daily with the president's doctors, and kept the vice president informed of significant developments on the president's condition.&lt;ref name=65FFH11827/&gt; 

* In October 1919, [[Woodrow Wilson]] suffered a debilitating [[stroke]]. Nearly blind and partially paralyzed, he spent the final 17 months of [[Presidency of Woodrow Wilson|his presidency]] sequestered in the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Amber| first=Saladin| title=Woodrow Wilson: Life After The Presidency| url=https://millercenter.org/president/wilson/life-after-the-presidency| publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| location=Charllotesville, Virginia| accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice President [[Thomas R. Marshall|Thomas Marshall]], the cabinet, and the nation were kept in the dark over the severity of the president's illness for several months. Marshall was pointedly afraid to ask about Wilson's health, or to preside over cabinet meetings, fearful that he would be accused of "longing for his place."  Though members of both parties in Congress pledged to support him if he asserted his claim to the presidency, Marshall declined to act, or to do anything that might seem ambitious or disloyal to Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Thomas R.

When [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] suffered a heart attack in September 1955, he and Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] developed an informal plan authorizing Nixon to assume some administrative duties during Eisenhower's recovery. Although it did not have the force of law, the plan helped to reassure the nation. The agreement also contained a provision whereby Eisenhower could declare his own inability and, if unable to do so, empowered Nixon, with appropriate consultation, to make the decision.&lt;ref name=XXVHeritage/&gt; Had it been invoked, Nixon would have served as acting president until the president issued a declaration of his recovery. Moved forward as consequence of President Kennedy's November 1963 assassination, this informal plan evolved into constitutional procedure a decade later through Sections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which resolved the uncertainties surrounding presidential disability.&lt;ref name=NCC25th/&gt;

Additionally, two vice presidents have temporarily assumed the powers and duties of the presidency as [[Acting President of the United States|acting president]], as authorized by Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment: [[George H. W.

== Presidential succession beyond the vice president ==

While several vice presidents have succeeded to the presidency upon the death or resignation of the president, and a number of them have died or resigned, the offices of President and Vice President have never been simultaneously vacant;{{efn-ua|Various friends and colleagues of Senator [[David Rice Atchison]] asserted that both offices were vacant on March 4–5 1849, because the [[Term of office|terms]] of President [[Zachary Taylor]] and Vice President [[Millard Fillmore]] began on March 4, but neither took their oath of office on that day{{snd}}following precedent as the day fell on a Sunday. The [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]] was held the next day, Monday, March 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.inaugural.senate.gov/about/past-inaugural-ceremonies/16th-inaugural-ceremonies/| title=The 16th Presidential Inauguration: Zachary Taylor, March 5, 1849| publisher=Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies| accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, they considered [[David Rice Atchison]], by virtue of being the last [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President ''pro tempore'' of the Senate]] in the out-going Congress, to have been [[Acting President of the United States]] during the day-long [[Interregnum]] (in accordance with the [[Presidential Succession Act]] of 1792). Historians, constitutional scholars and biographers all dismiss the claim. Atchison did not take the presidential oath of office either, and his term as president ''pro tempore'' had expired on March 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=From Failing Hands: the Story of Presidential Succession| last1=Feerick| first1=John D.| last2=Freund| first2=Paul A.| date=1965| url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=twentyfifth_amendment_books| publisher=Fordham University Press| location=New York City| pages=100–101| lccn=65-14917}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} thus no other officer in the presidential line of succession has ever been called upon to act as president. The prospect of such a ''double vacancy'' lurked in the shadows surrounding President Abraham Lincoln's 1865 assassination, as Vice President Andrew Johnson (along with Secretary of State [[William Seward]] and possibly General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]) was also targeted as part of [[John Wilkes Booth]]'s plot to destabilize the Union government. It was also there three years later, when, as president and with the vice presidency vacant, [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|Johnson was impeached]] by the House of Representatives and faced removal from office if convicted at trial in the Senate. Johnson was acquitted by a one-vote margin.&lt;ref name=50after25th/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The forgotten man who almost became President after Lincoln| url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-forgotten-man-who-almost-became-president-after-lincoln/| date=April 15, 2018|work=The constitution Daily| publisher=The National Constitution Center| location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania| accessdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratification of the 25th Amendment, with its mechanism for filling an intra-term vice presidential vacancy, has made calling on the speaker, president pro tempore, or a cabinet member to serve as acting president unlikely to happen, except in the aftermath of a catastrophic event.&lt;ref name=CRSsuccession05/&gt; Only a few years after it went into effect, in October 1973, at the height of [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]], Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] resigned. With Agnew's unexpected departure, and the state of [[Richard Nixon]]'s presidency, Speaker of the House [[Carl Albert]] was suddenly first in line to become acting president. The vacancy continued until [[Gerald Ford]] was sworn in as vice president on December 6, 1973.&lt;ref name=AlbertWasReady&gt;{{cite web| title=Speaker Albert Was Ready to Be President| last=Gup| first=Ted| date=November 28, 1982| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/11/28/speaker-albert-was-ready-to-be-president/84ebaa61-9cf1-4817-836e-a993e7e0e980/?utm_term=.766d612eb8a4| publisher=The Washington Post| accessdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert was also next in line from the time Ford assumed the presidency on August 9, 1974, following Nixon's resignation from office, until Ford's choice to succeed him as vice president, [[Nelson Rockefeller]], was confirmed by Congress four months later.&lt;ref name=Feerick2011FLR/&gt;

The vice presidency has been vacant on 18 occasions since 1789;&lt;ref name=VP-PS/&gt; during those periods, the following people have been next in line to serve as [[Acting President of the United States]]:

== Contemporary issues and concerns ==

In 2003, the [[Continuity of Government Commission]] suggested that the current law has "at least seven significant issues ... that warrant attention", specifically:
# The reality that all figures in the current line of succession work and reside in the vicinity of Washington, D.C. In the event of a nuclear, chemical, or biological attack, it is possible that everyone on the list would be killed or incapacitated.
# Doubt that congressional leaders are eligible to act as president.
# A concern about the wisdom of including the President pro tempore in the line of succession as the "largely honorific post traditionally held by the longest-serving Senator of the majority party".  For example, from January 20, 2001, to June 6, 2001, the President pro tempore was then-98-year-old [[Strom Thurmond]] of [[South Carolina]].
# A concern that the current line of succession can force the presidency to abruptly switch parties mid-term, as the president, Speaker, and the President pro tempore are not necessarily of the same party as each other.
# A concern that the succession line is ordered by the dates of creation of the various executive departments, without regard to the skills or capacities of the persons serving as their Secretary.
# The fact that, should a [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] member begin to act as president, the law allows the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] to elect a new Speaker (or the [[United States Senate|Senate]], a new President pro tempore), who could in effect remove the Cabinet member and assume the office themselves at any time.
# The absence of a provision where a president is disabled and the vice presidency is vacant (for example, if an assassination attempt simultaneously wounded the president and killed the vice president).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.continuityofgovernment.org/pdfs/FirstReport.pdf |title=The Continuity of Congress: The First Report of the Continuity of Government Commission| series=Preserving Our Institutions |page=4 |publisher=Continuity of Government Commission| location=Washington, D.C. |date=May 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625015852/http://www.continuityofgovernment.org/pdfs/FirstReport.pdf |archive-date=June 25, 2008 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=December 28, 2008| via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Continuity of Government Commission commented on the use of the term "Officer" in the 1947 statute,
{{quote|The language in the current Presidential Succession Act is less clear than that of the 1886 Act with respect to Senate confirmation. The 1886 Act refers to "such officers as shall have been appointed by the advice and consent of the Senate to the office therein named..." The current act merely refers to "officers appointed, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate." Read literally, this means that the current act allows for acting secretaries to be in the line of succession as long as they are confirmed by the Senate for a post (even for example, the second or third in command within a department). It is common for a second in command to become acting secretary when the secretary leaves office. Though there is some dispute over this provision, the language clearly permits acting secretaries to be placed in the line of succession. (We have spoken to acting secretaries who told us they had been placed in the line of succession.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/reports/2009/06_continuity_of_government/06_continuity_of_government.pdf |title=The Continuity of the Presidency: The Second Report of the Continuity of Government Commission |series=Preserving Our Institutions |page=34 |publisher=Continuity of Government Commission |location=Washington, D.C. |date=June 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67sZJhkHR?url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2009/7/06%20continuity%20of%20government/06_continuity_of_government.pdf |archive-date=May 23, 2012 |dead-url=yes |via=WebCite |accessdate=May 23, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
In 2016–17, the Second [[Fordham University School of Law]] Clinic on Presidential Succession developed a series of proposals to "resolve succession issues that have received little attention from scholars and commissions" over the past several decades. The clinic's recommendations included:
*Remove legislators and several Cabinet members from the line of succession and adding four officials, or "Standing Successors," outside of Washington, D.C. The line of succession would be: {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|1}}–}}Secretary of State, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|2}}–}}Secretary of Defense, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|3}}–}}Attorney General, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|4}}–}}Secretary of Homeland Security, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|5}}–}}Secretary of the Treasury, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|6}}–}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 1,}} {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|7}}–}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 2,}} {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|8}}–}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 3,}} and {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|9}}–}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 4;}}
*If legislators are not removed from the line of succession, only designate them as successors in cases where the President dies or resigns, not where he is disabled (to protect legislators from being forced to resign to act as President temporarily) or removed from office;
*Eliminate the "bumping provision" in the Succession Act of 1947;
*Clarify the ambiguity in the Succession Act of 1947 as to whether acting Cabinet secretaries are in the line of succession;
*That the outgoing President nominate and the Senate confirm some of the incoming President's Cabinet secretaries prior to Inauguration Day, which is a particular point of vulnerability for the line of succession;
*Establish statutory procedures for declaring {{Nowrap|1–}}a dual inability of the President and the Vice President, including where there is no Vice President and {{Nowrap|2–}}a sole inability of the Vice President.&lt;ref name=50after25th/&gt;

In British India, the '''''Vernacular Press Act''''' (Act of 1878) was enacted to curtail the freedom of the Indian press and prevent the expression of criticism toward British policies—notably, the opposition that had grown with the outset of the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] (1878–80).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The act was proposed by  [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], then [[Viceroy]] of India, and was unanimously passed by the Viceroy's Council on 14 March 1878. The act excluded English-language publications as it was meant to control seditious writing in 'publications in Oriental languages' everywhere in the country, except for the South.But the British totally discriminated the Indian Press.

The act empowered the government to impose restrictions on the press in the following ways:

1.) Modelled on the Irish press act, this act provided the government with extensive rights to censor reports and editorials in the Vernacular press.

2.) From now on the government kept regular track of Vernacular newspapers.

3.) When a report published in the newspaper was judged as seditious, the newspaper was warned.

4.)No Indian was allowed to carry arms without license

==History==
The first periodicals in India were under the control of East India Company, and the press sometimes created a problem for the interests of the company. This resulted in the first two papers being banned—one started by Bolt and the Bengal Gazette. Lord Wellesley regulated the press again  in 1799; according to which press had to show and get approval of the government before the publication of any manuscript including advertisement. During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the "Gagging Act" had been passed by Lord Canning which sought to regulate the establishment of printing presses and to restrain the mad of printed mater. All presses had to have a license from the government with distinction between publications in [[English language|English]] and other regional languages. The Act also held that no printed material shall impugn the motives of the [[British Raj]], tending to bring it hatred and contempt and exciting unlawful resistance to its orders. When the British Government found that the Gagging Act was not potent enough to repress all nationalist sentiments, it created a more forcible law, designed in part by Sir [[Alexander John Arbuthnot]] and Sir [[Ashley Eden]], Lieutenant Governor of Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akhtar|first=M. Javaid|last2=Ali|first2=Azra Asghar|last3=Akhtar|first3=Shahnaz|date=|year=2010|title=The Role of Vernacular Press in Subcontinent During the British Rule: A Study of Perceptions|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.701.1351&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Pakistan Journal of Social Sciences|volume=30|pages=71–84|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time the Vernacular Press Act was passed, there were thirty five vernacular papers in Bengal, including the ''[[Amrita Bazar Patrika]]'', the editor of which was one [[Sisir Kumar Ghose]]. Sir [[Ashley Eden]] summoned him and offered to contribute to his paper regularly if he gave him final editorial approval. Ghose refused, and remarked that “there ought to be at least one honest journalist in the land.” The Vernacular Press Act might be said to have grown from this incident. About the time the Act was passed, Sir Ashley remarked in a speech that forty five seditious writings published in fifteen different vernacular papers were presented to him before the Act was finalized.

The Vernacular Press Act stated that any [[magistrate]] or [[Commissioner of Police]] had the authority to call upon any printer or publisher of a newspaper to enter into a bond, undertaking not to print a certain kind of material, and could confiscate any printed material it deemed objectionable. The Act provided for submitting to police all the proof sheets of contents of papers before publication. What was seditious news was to be determined by the police, and not by the judiciary. Under this Act many of the papers were fined, their editors jailed. Thus, they were subject to [[prior restraint]].  The affected party could not seek redress in a court of law. General threats to the Indian language press included:

# [[Subversion]] of democratic institutions
# Agitations and violent incidents
# False allegations against British authorities or individuals
# Endangering law and order to disturb the normal functioning of the state
# Threats to internal stability

Any one or more of the above were punishable by law, but no redress could be sought in any court in the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh|last=Islam|first=Sirajul|publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]|year=2012|edition=Second|chapter=Vernacular Press Act, 1878|chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Vernacular_Press_Act,_1878|editor1-last=Islam|editor1-first=Sirajul|editor1-link=Sirajul Islam|editor2-last=Jamal|editor2-first=Ahmed A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Because the British government was in a hurry to pass the bill without encouraging any reactions whatever, the bill was not published in the usual papers in Calcutta and the [[North-Western Provinces]] were the slowest in obtaining information. While the ''[[Amrita Bazar Patrika]]'' in Calcutta had converted itself into an all-English weekly within a week of the passing of the Vernacular Press Act, papers in the north were wondering what the exact provisions of the act were, even after two weeks of its existence. The following years saw the appearance and disappearance of a number of Bengali journals in quick succession, failing to gain support with their poverty of language and thought.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Once  publishers learned of the provisions, the repressive measure encountered strong opposition.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/626266/Vernacular-Press-Act|title=Vernacular Press Act {{!}} 1878, India|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the native associations irrespective of religion, caste and creed denounced the measure and kept their protests alive.  All the prominent leaders of Bengal and India condemned the Act as unwarranted and unjustified, and demanded its immediate withdrawal. The newspapers themselves kept criticizing the measure without end. The succeeding administration of [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]] reviewed the developments consequent upon the Act and finally withdrew it. However, the resentment it produced among Indians helped fuel India’s growing independence movement. The Indian Association, which is generally considered to be one of the precursors of the Indian National Congress, was one of the Act's biggest critics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The crucial demand for a judicial trial in case of an accusation of sedition against an editor was never conceded by the government, although in October 1878 the act was modified in minor respect; the submission of proofs before publication was no longer insisted upon, although the bail-bond remained.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Uma Das|date=1977|title=The Indian Press 1870-1880: A Small World of  Journalism|url=|journal=Modern Asian Studies|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=2|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:YoutubeCopyrightStrike.png|thumb|A copyright strike on YouTube]]
A '''YouTube copyright strike''' is a copyright policing practice used by [[YouTube]] for the purpose of managing [[copyright infringement]] and complying with the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]].&lt;ref name="EFF 2009"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Electronic Frontier Foundation|authorlink1=Electronic Frontier Foundation|title=A Guide to YouTube Removals|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/intellectual-property/guide-to-youtube-removals|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=13 July 2016|date=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) is the basis for the design of the YouTube copyright strike system.&lt;ref name="EFF 2009"/&gt; For YouTube to retain [[DMCA safe harbor]] protection, it must respond to copyright infringement claims with a [[notice and take down]] process.&lt;ref name="EFF 2009"/&gt; YouTube's own practice is to issue a "YouTube copyright strike" on the user accused of copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="EFF 2009"/&gt; When a YouTube user has three copyright strikes, YouTube terminates that user's YouTube channel, removes all of their videos from that user's YouTube channel, and prohibits that user from creating another YouTube channel.&lt;ref name="EFF 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright strike basics|url=https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000|website=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YouTube assigns strikes based on reports of copyright violations from bots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Douglas |first1=Nick |title=You Can't Fool YouTube's Copyright Bots |url=https://lifehacker.com/you-cant-fool-youtubes-copyright-bots-1822174263 |website=Lifehacker |date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some users have expressed concern that the strike process is unfair to users.&lt;ref name="BBC 2010"&gt;{{cite news|author1=staff|title=Is YouTube's three-strike rule fair to users?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/8696716.stm|accessdate=13 July 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint is that the system assumes guilt of YouTube users and takes the side of copyright holders even when no infringement has occurred.&lt;ref name="BBC 2010"/&gt;

YouTube and [[Nintendo]] were criticised by Cory Doctorow, a writer for the blog ''[[Boing Boing]]'', due to them reportedly treating video game reviewers unfairly by threatening them with strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Cory Doctorow|authorlink1=Cory Doctorow|title=Youtube and Nintendo conspire to steal from game superfans|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/03/27/youtube-and-nintendo-conspire.html|website=[[Boing Boing]]|accessdate=13 July 2016|date=Mar 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for strikes==

=== Disagreements about what constitutes fair use===

[[Fair use]] is a legal rationale for reusing copyrighted content in a limited way, such as to discuss or criticize other media. Various YouTube creators have reported receiving copyright strikes for using media in the context of fair use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Alexander |first1=Julia |title=YouTubers voice concerns over hefty Universal Pictures copyright strikes |url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/3/17190018/universal-pictures-copyright-strike-chris-stuckmann-youtube-appeal |website=Polygon |date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suppression of criticism===
Various YouTube creators have reported receiving copyright strikes on videos which are critical of corporate products. They claim that a claim of copyright violation is actually a strategy to suppress criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Eordogh |first1=Fruzsina |title=TikTok's Owners Falsely Copyright Strike Criticism Of App |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/fruzsinaeordogh/2018/09/01/tiktoks-owners-falsely-copyright-strike-criticism-of-app/#213caa656586 |website=Forbes |language=en |date=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strikes for posting own work===
Copyright strikes have also been issued against creators themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weiss |first1=Geoff |title=YouTube Guitarist Claims He Got A Copyright Strike For Infringing Upon His Own Song - Tubefilter |url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2018/07/06/youtube-guitarist-copyright-infringement-own-song/ |website=Tubefilter |date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Miracle of Sound]]'''s channel was hit with multiple copyright strikes as a result of automated strikes by the distributor of their own music.&lt;ref name="copyright strikes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/130667-YouTube-Issued-Copyright-Claims-Against-Miracle-of-Sound | title=YouTube Issued Copyright Claims Against Miracle of Sound | publisher=The Escapist | date=19 December 2013 | accessdate=23 October 2016 | author=Lemon, Marshall}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Strikes for works in Public Domain===
In a similar incident to such strikes, though in another forum, Sony issued an automated copyright strike against James Rhodes for a video on Facebook of him playing part of a piece by [[Johann_Sebastian_Bach|Bach]], on the grounds that they owned the copyright on a similar recording, and when the strike was challenged, asserted that they owned the rights to the work, before finally admitting that Bach's compositions are in the public domain. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Doctorow |first1=Cory |title=The future is here today: you can't play Bach on Facebook because Sony says they own his compositions |url=https://boingboing.net/2018/09/05/mozart-bach-sorta-mach.html |website=BoingBoing |date=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strikes for unknown reasons===
Some publishers on YouTube report not understanding why they are the recipient of strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Klepek |first1=Patrick |title=Atlus Keeps Hitting Tiny YouTube Channels With Copyright Strikes |url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/10/atlus-keeps-hitting-tiny-youtube-channels-with-copyright-strikes/ |website=Kotaku Australia |language=en |date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
