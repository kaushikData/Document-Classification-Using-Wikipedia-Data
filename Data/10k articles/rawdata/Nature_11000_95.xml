'''{{mp|2018 CC}}''' is a micro-[[asteroid]], classified as a [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], approximately {{convert|20|m|ft|sigfig=1|sp=us}} in diameter. Its official first observation was made by the [[Catalina Sky Survey]] at [[Mount Lemmon Observatory]], Arizona, United States, on 4 February 2018.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; Two days later, the asteroid crossed the [[orbit of the Moon]] and made a very close approach to Earth.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

{{mp|2018 CC}} belongs to the [[Apollo asteroid]]s, which [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|cross the orbit of Earth]]. Apollo's are the largest group of [[near-Earth objects]] with nearly 10 thousand known members. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.84–1.73&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 18 months (531 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 1.28&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.35 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 8[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; With an [[aphelion]] of 1.73&amp;nbsp;AU, it is also a [[Mars-crosser]], as it crosses the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.66&amp;nbsp;AU.

The body's [[observation arc]] begins with its first recorded observation by [[Pan-STARRS]] on 20 January 2018.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

=== Close approaches ===

The object has a low [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] with Earth of {{convert |0.0002 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3 |order=flip}}, which corresponds to 0.078 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]] (LD). On 8 February 2034, it will approach Earth to a distance of {{convert |0.0212 |AU |km mi |abbr=on }} or 8.2&amp;nbsp;LD.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

==== 2018 flyby ====

On 6 February 2018, it passed at a nominal distance of {{convert |0.0012640 |AU |km mi |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3}} from Earth (0.49 LD). One hour earlier, it passed the Moon at {{convert |0.0038564 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3 |order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

The body's physical parameter remain largely unknown.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; Based on a generic [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]-to-diameter conversion, and for an [[absolute magnitude]] of 26.541, the asteroid measures 15 and 40 meters in diameter, assuming a carbonaceous and stony [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.057 and 0.20, respectively.&lt;ref name="h" /&gt; No rotational [[lightcurve]] has been obtained from photometric observations, and no [[rotation period]], shape or [[Poles of astronomical bodies|pole]] has been determined.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Naming ==

As of 2018, this [[minor planet]] has not been numbered or [[List of named minor planets (numerical)|named]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

==History==
In May 1999, trading started at the '''Amsterdam Power Exchange''' (APX). It was the first [[electricity market|electricity exchange market]] in [[Continental Europe]]. In 2000, the UK's first independent power exchange  UKPX (now APX Power UK) was established followed by launch of APX UK electricity spot market in 2001.  UKPX was acquired by APX in 2004.
ENDEX was acquired by APX Group in 2008 and the integration was completed in 2009. After merging the APX Group and ENDEX a new name APX-ENDEX was introduced.
In 2005, APX became a shareholder of Belgian power exchange '''Belpex SA'''.&lt;ref name="belpex.be"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belpex.be|title=EPEX SPOT Belgium (formerly Belpex)|author=|date=|website=www.belpex.be|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19 April 2010, APX and Belpex announced that they will integrate their activities and Belpex is becoming a part of APX. Belpex is a 100% subsidiary of APX.

On 1 March 2013, APX-ENDEX separated into two companies: the power spot exchange APX and the gas spot, gas derivatives and power derivatives exchange ENDEX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apxgroup.com/press-releases/elia-system-operator-and-tennet-holding-confirm-the-launch-of-dedicated-power-spot-and-clearing-exchange-apx-as-of-today/|title=Elia System Operator and TenneT Holding confirm the launch of dedicated power spot and clearing exchange APX as of today - EPEX SPOT - Welcome|author=|date=|website=apxgroup.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 27 March 2014, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is the majority shareholder of ENDEX.

Alphesiboea was deserted by her husband for the love of [[Callirrhoe (daughter of Achelous)|Callirhoe]], daughter of the river-god [[Achelous]]. In revenge, her brothers Axion and Temenus at the command of their father treacherously slew their brother-in-law.

[[File:Saraswati f. Strassenpuja.JPG|thumb|An idol of Goddess [[Saraswati]] prepared for [[Vasant Panchami]] in the streets of [[Kolkata]].]]
'''Vasanta''' ({{lang-sa|वसन्तः}}; {{lang-hi|बसंत}}; {{lang-bn|বসন্ত}}; {{lang-pa|ਬਸੰਤ}}, {{lang|pa|{{Nastaliq|ﺑﺴﻨﺖ}}}}; {{lang-kn|ವಸಂತ}}; {{lang-te|వసంత}}; {{lang-ml|വസന്തം}}, {{lang-ta|வஸந்தம்}}) also known as '''Basant''', refers to the [[Ritu (Indian season)|Indian spring]], and ''ritu'' means season.&lt;ref&gt;Arman A. U. K. ''Urs Aur Melay'' Kitab Manzil, Lahore 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main festivals of the Vasanta season is celebrated on ''[[Vasanta Panchami]]'' ({{lang-sa|वसन्त पञ्चमी}}) which in Nepali and Indian society is a cultural and religious festival, celebrated annually on the first day of spring, the fifth day (Panchami) of the [[Hindu]] month ''[[Maagha|Magh]]'' (January–February).

== Origin ==
In [[Sanskrit]] ''Vasanta'' means ''spring''. Panchami is the fifth day of ''Shukla Paksha'', the fortnight of the waxing moon in the [[Hindu]] month of Magh, (January - February). [[Vasanta Panchami]], which marks the end of the winter and heralds in spring, is dedicated to goddess [[Saraswati]]. She is a goddess of water and of a river bearing her name. Her water originates in the Himalayas, flows southeast and meets the Ganges at Prayag near its confluence with the Yamuna (Triveni). Saraswati is also a goddess of speech and learning who blesses the world with ''vach'' (words), hymns, Sanskrit and the wealth of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindukids.org/stories/festivals/index.html "Hindu festivals."] Hindu kids website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiasite.com/festivals/basantpanchami.html "Basant Pachami."] India site website.&lt;/ref&gt; It is auspicious for children to begin school and learn their first word on this day.  In the ancient Indian texts, the ''[[Vedas]]'', the prayer for Sarasvati depicts her as a pristine lady in a white dress embellished with white flowers and white pearls. She sits on a white lotus blooming in a wide stretch of water (''neluhini''). She holds a ''[[veena]]'', a string instrument similar to a sitar. No animal is sacrifices and Indians have a vegetarian meal. Saraswati's prayer concludes,
:"Oh, Mother Sarasvati, remove the darkness (ignorance) of my mind and bless me with the eternal knowledge."

In India, Vasanta is not a [[Public holiday|national holiday]]. However, it is celebrated in North and Eastern India. Students participate in the decoration and preparation of their place of worship. A few weeks before the celebration, schools become active in organizing various annual competitions of music, debate, sports and other activities. Prizes are distributed on the day of [[Vasanta Panchami]]. Many schools organize cultural activities in the evening of the Saraswati Puja day when parents and other community members attend the functions to encourage the children.

=== Hindu festival ===
On Vasanta Pachami day, everyone rises early to bathe, dress in yellow clothes, adorn their forehead with the yellow of [[turmeric]] (''[[tilak]]''), and worship the sun goddess, [[Ganges in Hinduism|Mother Ganga]], and the earth. Books, articles, musical instruments, tools for art such as earthen inkpots and bamboo quills, are placed in front of the goddess to receive her blessings. The ink is made from unboiled milk water, red colour powder and silver glitter called ''avro''. Although it is auspicious for children to learn their first word on this day of celebration, everyone abstains from their usual reading and writing in deference to the goddess.

The colour yellow represents good fortune, spirituality, the ripening of the spring crops and the recent harvest. Food is coloured with [[saffron]]. The goddess Saraswati is dressed in yellow. In some traditional homes, sweetmeats of yellowish hues, such as kesar [[halva]] are offered to relatives and friends. Yellow flowers are used in abundance to decorate the places of worship. The yellow flowers of the mustard crop covers the field in such a way that it seems as if gold is spread over the land, glittering in the rays of the sun.

=== Sufi festival ===
The [[Sufis]] introduced the festival to the Muslim community in [[Indian subcontinent|India]]. By the [[Mughal empire|Mughal]] period, Basant was a popular festival at major Sufi shrines. There are, for example, historical records of Nizam Auliya ki Basant, Khwaja Bakhtiar Kaki ki Basant, Khusrau ki Basant; festivals arranged around the shrines of these various Sufi saints. [[Amir Khusro]] (1253-1325) and [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] celebrated the festival with songs that used the word ''basant'' (festival).&lt;ref&gt;Blum S. and Neuman D. M. "Ethnomusicology and modern music history." University of Illinois Press 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Khusrau, a Sufi-poet of the thirteenth century, composed verses about Vasanta:
{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}
Aaj basant manaalay, suhaagan,
Aaj basant manaalay
Anjan manjan kar piya mori, lambay neher lagaalay
Tu kya sovay neend ki maasi,
So jaagay teray bhaag, suhaagun,
Aaj basant manaalay.
Oonchi naar kay oonchay chitvan,
Ayso diyo hai banaaye

Suhaagun, aaj basant manaalay.

Celebrate basant today,
O bride, Celebrate Basant today
Apply [[kajal]] to your eyes, and decorate your long hair
Oh why are you the servant of sleep?
Even your fate is wide awake,
Celebrate Basant today,
O high lady with high looks,
That is how you were made,
When the king looks at you, your eyes meet his eyes,
O Bride, Celebrate Basant today.''

In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], Pahela stands for 'first' and 'Falgun' is eleventh month of the [[Bengali calendar]]. This day is marked with colourful celebration and traditionally, women wear yellow saris to celebrate this day. This celebration is also as ''Basanta Utsab'' ({{lang-bn|বসন্ত উৎসব }}; ''Spring Festival'').

==Pakistan ==
Basant celebrations in [[Pakistan]] are limited. Instead, the ''Jashn-e-baharaan'' ([[Urdu (language)|Urdu]]) spring festival is celebrated for one month. However, Basant does continue in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\03\15\story_15-3-2009_pg13_3 "Basant."] ''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]'' 15 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thingsasian.com/goto_article/photoessay.2100.html "Pakistan's Basant festival."] Things Asian photoessay.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
Controversy about the celebration of Basant in Pakistan is due to its Hindu origin in a now [[Islamism|Islamic]] republic,{{fact|date=January 2018}} and due to concerns about its safety. Safety concerns include the use of metal or glass coated kite strings (a slurry of fine glass shards which allowed one flyer to cut another's kite loose), power breakdowns due to damage from kites, overcrowding and the use of firearms. In small villages, disadvantaged children were trying to pull down kites. In 2005, kite flying was banned in Pakistan. In 2009, nine people in Pakistan died in kite flying related incidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4792776.stm "Pakistan province kite flying ban."] BBC South Asia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=167136] The News. 13 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/12/09/pakistan.kites/ "Kite ban sparks violent protests."] CNN 9 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albalagh.net/food_for_thought/basant.shtml "Kites of blasphemy: an Islamic perspective on Basant."] Albalagh blog.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Punjab region]]===
In the [[Punjab region]], the Vasanta Pachami is known as the ''Basant Panchami''. In the towns and villages of North India, Vasanta Pachami is celebrated as the secular [[Basant Kite Festival (Punjab)|Basant Festival]] of kites by all communities as a seasonal festival. Fields of mustard present a colourful sight all over rural Punjab. The phrase ''Ayi Basant Pala Udant'', meaning, "with the onset of spring, winter bids adieu" is used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webindia123.com/punjab/festivals/fairs.htm "Punjab fairs."] Web India 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times"&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/Basant-muse-colours-itself-in-diverse-hues/articleshow/5481966.cms "Basant muse colours itself in diverse hues."]  ''The Times of India'' 20 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blood meal''' is a dry, inert powder made from [[blood]], used as a high-[[nitrogen]] [[organic fertilizer]] and a high [[protein]] animal feed. N = 13.25%, P = 1.0%, K = 0.6%. It is one of the highest non-synthetic sources of nitrogen. It usually comes from [[cattle]] or [[pig|hogs]] as a [[slaughterhouse]] [[by-product]].

== Uses ==

=== Dietary supplement ===
Blood meal can be used as a [[livestock]] [[dietary supplement]] and is mainly added to supply dietary [[lysine]] for cattle, fish and poultry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=William Arnon |last1=Henry |first2=Frank Barron |last2=Morrison |year=1915 |title=Feeds and feeding: a hand-book for the student and stockman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVgaAAAAIAAJ |publisher=Henry-Morrison |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to use, it is sometimes mixed with [[molasses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9719848 |year=1998 |last1=King'ori |first1=AM |last2=Tuitoek |first2=JK |last3=Muiruri |first3=HK |title=Comparison of fermented dried blood meal and cooked dried blood meal as protein supplements for growing pigs. |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=191–6 |journal=Tropical animal health and production}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organic fertilizers ===
Blood meal, [[bone meal]], and other animal by-products are permitted in [[certified organic]] production as soil amendments, though they cannot be fed to organic livestock. Blood meal is different from [[bone meal]] in that blood meal contains a higher amount of nitrogen, while bone meal contains phosphorus. Alternatives to Blood Meal include [[feather meal]] and alfalfa meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Using Blood Meal To Improve Your Garden Soil|url=http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/organic/blood-meal-fertilizer.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood meal is sometimes used as a [[composting]] activator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.extension.illinois.edu/homecompost/materials.cfm|title=University of Illinois Extension|last=|first=|date=|website=Composting For The Home Owner|publisher=|access-date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pest control ===
Blood meal can be spread on gardens to deter pest animals such as [[rabbit]]s. The theory is that the animals smell the blood and are repelled by the odor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Fern Marshall |last1=Bradley |first2=Barbara W. |last2=Ellis |year=1997 |title=Review: Rodale's All-New Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening: The Indispensable Resource for Every Gardener |publisher=Rodale Press |isbn=978-0-87596-743-1 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Leandre |last1=Poisson |first2=Gretchen |last2=Vogel Poisson |year=1994 |title=Solar gardening: growing vegetables year-round the American intensive way |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YQnRrUvFPoIC |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing |isbn=978-0-930031-69-5 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processing ==
Blood needs to be dried before being used as blood meal. Several drying methods are available: solar drying, oven drying, drum drying, flash drying or spray drying.&lt;ref&gt;Heuzé V., Tran G., 2016.

'''Sin-Kamen''' (Синь-Камень, in [[Russian language|Russian]] literally – '''Blue Stone''', or '''Blue Rock''') is a type of [[pagan]] [[sacred]] [[stone]]s, widespread in [[Russia]] in areas historically inhabited by both [[East Slavic peoples|Eastern Slavic]] ([[Russians|Russian]]), and [[Uralic peoples|Uralic]] tribes ([[Merya]], [[Muroma]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogorodsk-noginsk.ru/atlas/sinie_kamni.html И.Д.

Unlike [[Sledovik]] (both ''Sledovik'' proper and ''Cup-stones''), ''Blue Stones'' did not have major hallows on them, and were venerated in a simpler way: by pouring [[water]] on them, or leaving food [[Votive offering|offerings]]. Some of the Blue Stones are still known, and to some extent venerated by local populations.

If used as a personal name, ''Sin-Kamen'' (Blue Rock) usually refers to the most famous sacred stone of this kind, located on a shore of [[Lake Pleshcheyevo]] near [[Pereslavl-Zalesskiy]].

"'''Bog butter'''" refers to an ancient [[wax]]y substance found buried in [[peat]] [[bog]]s, particularly in Ireland and Great Britain. Likely an old method of making and preserving [[Butter#Middle Ages|butter]], some tested lumps of bog butter were made of dairy products while others were meat-based.&lt;ref name=sto269&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.show.me.uk/site/news/STO269.html |title=Bog Butter Mystery Solved? |date=2004-04-02 |accessdate=2010-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719140902/http://www.show.me.uk/site/news/STO269.html |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bog butter is found buried inside some sort of wooden container, such as [[bucket]]s, [[keg]]s, [[barrel]]s, dishes and [[butter churn]]s. It is of animal origin, and is also known as '''butyrellite'''. Until 2003 [[scientist]]s and [[archaeologist]]s were not quite sure of the origin of bog butter. Scientists working at the [[University of Bristol]] discovered that some samples of the "butter" were of [[adipose tissue|adipose]]/[[tallow]] origin while others were of [[dairy]] origin.&lt;ref name=sto269 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18124392.400-bog-butter-test.html |title= Bog Butter test |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=2004-03-20 |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.culture24.org.uk/places+to+go/south+west/bristol/art20488 |title= Experts Get To The Bottom Of Ancient Bog Butter Mystery |date=23 March 2004 |first= David|last= Prudames |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland, the practice of burying bog butter dates back to the first century AD, with bog butter found in Co Meath.  On 28 April 2011, there were press reports of a find of approximately {{convert|50|kg|lb}} of bog butter in [[Tullamore]], County Offaly.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news |title=For Peat’s Safe: Bog Butter Unearthed with Turf |work=Irish Times |date=28 Apr 2011 |accessdate=15 Aug 2015 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/for-peat-s-safe-bog-butter-unearthed-with-turf-1.583009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Found in a carved wooden vessel {{convert|0.3|m|ft}} in diameter and {{convert|0.6|m|ft}} in height, it was buried at a depth of {{convert|2.3|m|ft}},&lt;ref name=Archaeology&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Irish Archaeology |url=http://irisharchaeology.ie/2011/04/bog-butter/ |title=Bog Butter Find from Co.

Bog butter was produced by interring butter or other fats within a [[peat]] bog after encasement within a wooden container, although augmentation of the latter with a deerskin bladder&lt;ref name=Earwood&gt;{{cite journal |author=Earwood, Caroline |title=Bog Butter: A Two Thousand Year History |journal=The Journal of Irish Archaeology|volume=8 |year=1997 |pages=25–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; or layers of plant fibres&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams, James |title=A Sample of Bog Butter from Lachar Moss, Dunfriesshire |journal=Transactions of the Dumfriesshire and Galloway Natural History and Antiquities Society |volume=43 |year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; was not unusual.  The containers tend to be well-sealed with a convex surface, perhaps to prevent water from pooling and stagnating in direct contact with the packaging and/or contents.&lt;ref name=Reade&gt;{{cite web |author=Reade, Ben |title=Bog Butter: A Gastronomic Perspective |publisher=Nordic Food Lab |date=30 Oct 2013 |accessdate=15 Aug 2015 |url=http://nordicfoodlab.org/blog/2013/10/bog-butter-a-gastronomic-perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original motivations behind the creation of bog butter are unclear. One widespread theory is that [[food product]]s were buried in bogs to hinder spoilage.  Peat bogs, being [[refrigeration|low temperature]], low oxygen, highly acidic environments, have excellent preservative properties.  Experiments conducted by researcher Daniel C. Fisher demonstrated that pathogen and bacterial counts of meat buried in peat bogs for up to two years were comparable to levels found in control samples stored in a modern freezer,&lt;ref name=Pobojewski&gt;{{cite web |author=Pobojewski, Sally |title=Underwater Storage Techniques Preserved Meat for Early Hunters |publisher=The University Record |date=8 May 1995 |accessdate=15 Aug 2015 |url=http://www.ur.umich.edu/9495/May08_95/storage.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that this could be an effective preservation method.

An alternative hypothesis is "primitive food processing": it is possible that "chemical reactions in the soil helped to transform the foods to more palatable products than could be made fresh"&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;{{cite web |author=Ball, Philip |title=Mysteries of Bog Butter Uncovered |publisher=Nature |date=17 Mar 2004 |doi=10.1038/news040315-5 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 Aug 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;—especially given the absence of salt in bog butters—or increase available nutrient content.&lt;ref name=Reade/&gt;  In traditional cuisines, burial is a fairly common step in the preparation of highly perishable foods such as meat and dairy products; examples include [[century eggs]] (China), [[gravlax|gravad lax]] (Scandinavia), [[hákarl]] (Iceland), the Inuit dishes [[igunaq]] and [[kiviaq (food)|kiviaq]], and Moroccan [[smen]].&lt;ref name=Reade/&gt; Modern experiments in creating bog butter yield a product that seems to be an acquired taste, with "flavor notes which were described primarily as ‘animal’ or ‘gamey’, ‘moss’, ‘funky’, ‘pungent’, and ‘salami’. These characteristics are certainly a far cry from the creamy acidity of a freshly made cultured butter, but has been found useful in the kitchen especially with strong and pungent dishes, in a similar manner to aged ghee"&lt;ref name=Reade/&gt;

The practice of burying butter and other fats could also have arisen as a strategy for protecting vital provisions from thieves and/or invaders.  For instance, in early medieval Ireland, there is no doubt that butter was a luxury food, with legal texts carefully delineating the quantity of butter which members of each socio-economic class were entitled to consume.&lt;ref name=Sexton&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Sexton |author-first=Regina |chapter=The Role and Function of Butter in the Diet of the Monk and Penitent in Early Medieval Ireland |title=The Fat of the Land: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cooking 2002 |editor-last=Walker |editor-first=Harlan |location=Bristol |publisher=Footwork |date=2003 |pages=253–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|254–5}}  Yet butter also had numerous, widespread non-culinary uses such as the payment of taxes, rents, and fines; facilitation of hospitality; care of the sick and infirm; and strengthening of social bonds.&lt;ref name=Sexton/&gt;{{rp|254–6}}  On occasion, butter might also have less prestigious applications, including waterproofing, and making candles or even cement.&lt;ref name="ÓDubhthaigh"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ó Dubhthaigh, Niall |title=Summer Pasture in Donegal |journal=Folk Life |volume=22 |year=1984 |pages=42–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequency with which famines and animal epidemics struck would have necessitated development of storage techniques to protect this important product.&lt;ref name=Sexton/&gt;{{rp|254}} It is possible many stashes were never retrieved due to enemy occupation or simple forgetfulness.

== Smen==
A version of bog butter, [[Smen]] is still produced in North Africa – it is butter processed with thyme to start an enzyme process, then wrapped in herbs, encased in wood and stored in bogs. It is considered a [[gourmet]] food comparable to fine cheese.

They are sometimes also referred to as constrained or inaccessible RNA [[molecules]]. BNA [[monomers]] can contain a five-membered, six-membered or even a seven-membered bridged structure with a “fixed” C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;’-endo sugar puckering.&lt;ref&gt;Saenger, W. (1984) ''Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure'', Springer-Verlag, New York, {{ISBN|3-540-90761-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge is synthetically incorporated at the 2’, 4’-position of the ribose to afford a 2’, 4’-BNA monomer. The monomers can be incorporated into [[oligonucleotide]] polymeric structures using standard phosphoamidite chemistry. BNAs are structurally rigid oligo-nucleotides with increased binding affinities and stability.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of the bridge can vary for different types of monomers. The 3D structures for A-RNA and B-DNA were used as a template for the design of the BNA monomers. The goal for the design was to find derivatives that possess high binding affinities with complementary RNA and/or DNA strands.

The presence of 2’-hydroxyls in the RNA backbone favors a structure that resembles the A-form structure of DNA. The flexible five-membered [[furanose]] ring in nucleotides exists in [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] of two preferred conformations of the N- (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;’-endo, A-form) and the S-type (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;’-endo, B-form) as illustrated in the next figure.

An increased conformational inflexibility of the sugar moiety in [[nucleosides]] (oligonucleotides) results in a gain of high binding affinity with complementary single-stranded RNA and/or double-stranded DNA. The first 2’,4’-BNA (LNA) monomers were first synthesized by Takeshi Imanishi’s group in 1997&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; followed independently by Jesper Wengel’s group in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Koshkin | first1 = A.

Chemical structures of other BNAs that were synthesized in the past years as indicated below the structures.

BNA [[nucleotides]] can be incorporated into DNA or RNA [[oligonucleotides]] at any desired position. Such oligomers are synthesized chemically and are now commercially available. The bridged ribose conformation enhances base stacking and pre-organizes the backbone of the oligonucleotide significantly increasing their hybridization properties. 
 
The incorporation of BNAs into oligonucleotides allows the production of modified synthetic oligonucleotides with:

*Equal or higher binding affinity against an DNA or RNA complement with excellent single-mismatch discriminating power,  
*Better RNA selective binding, 
*Stronger and more sequence selective triplex-forming characters, and 
*Pronounced higher nuclease resistance, even higher than  Sp-phosphorothioate analogues, 
*Good aqueous [[solubility]] of the resulting oligonucleotides when compared to regular DNA or RNA oligonucleotides.

[[File:BNAH8.png|thumb|750px|center]]

Chemical structures of BNAs were introduced in 2007 by Imanishi’s group.&lt;ref name="AbdurRahman" /&gt; These new generation of BNAs analogues are called 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NH], 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NMe], and 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NBn].

New BNA analogs introduced by Imanishi’s group were designed by taking the length of the bridged [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] into account. A six-membered bridged structure with a unique structural feature (N-O bond) in the sugar moiety was designed to have a nitrogen atom. This atom improves the formation of duplexes and triplexes by lowering the repulsion between the negatively charged backbone phosphates. These modifications allow to control the affinity towards complementary strands, regulate resistance against nuclease degradation and the synthesis of functional molecules designed for specific applications in genomics. The properties of these analogs were investigated and compared to those of previous 2’,4’-BNA (LNA) modified oligonucleotides by Imanishi’s group. Imanishi’s results show that “2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;-modified oligonucleotides with these profiles show great promise for applications in antisense and antigene technologies.”

Makoto Koizumi in 2004 reviewed the properties of BNAs with focus on ENAs as antisense and antigen oligonucleotides (AONs) and proposed an action mechanism for these compounds that may involve translation arrest, mRNA degradation mediated by RNase H and splicing arrest. This is illustrated in the following figure.

[[File:BNAH9.png|thumb|750px|center]]

==Proposed mechanism of action of AONs==
Yamamoto et al. in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Koizumi | first1 = M. 
| title = ENA oligonucleotides as therapeutics 
| journal = Current Opinion in Molecular Therapeutics

}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that BNA-based antisense therapeutics inhibited hepatic PCSK9 expression, resulting in a strong reduction of the serum LDL-C levels of mice. The findings supported the hypothesis that PCSK9 is a potential therapeutic target for hypercholesterolemia and the researchers were able to show that BNA-based antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) induced cholesterol-lowering action in hypercholesterolemic mice.  A moderate increase of aspartate aminotransferase, ALT, and blood urea nitrogen levels was observed whereas the histopathological analysis revealed no severe hepatic toxicities. The same group, also in 2012, reported that the 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NMe] analog when used in antisense oligonucleotides showed significantly stronger inhibitory activities which is more pronounced in shorter (13- to 16mer) oligonucleotides. Their data led the researchers to conclude that the 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NMe] analog may be a better alternative to conventional LNAs.

==Benefits of the BNA technology==
Some of the benefits of BNAs include:
*Ideal for the detection of short RNA and DNA targets
*Increase the thermal stability of duplexes
*Capable of single nucleotide discrimination
*Increases the thermal stability of triplexes
*Resistance to exo- and enconucleases resulting in a high stability for ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro'' applications
*Increased target specificity
*Facilitate Tm normalization
*Strand invasion enables detection of “hard to access” samples
*Compatible with standard enzymatic processes

==Application of the BNA technology==
Application of BNAs include:
*Small RNA research 
*Design and synthesis of RNAaptamers
*siRNA
*Antisense probes
*Diagnostics
*Isolation
*Microarray analysis
*Northern blotting
*Real-time PCR
*''In situ'' hybridization
*Functional analysis
*SNP detection
*Use as antigens and many others  nucleotide base applications.

'''C/{{mp|2015 ER|61}} (PANSTARRS)''' is a [[comet]], inner [[Oort cloud]] object, [[Amor asteroid|Amor]] [[Near-Earth object|near-Earth asteroid]], and possibly a [[damocloid]]. When classified as a minor planet, it had the fourth-largest [[aphelion]] of any known minor planet in the Solar System, after {{mpl|2005 VX|3}}, {{mpl|2012 DR|30}}, and {{mpl|2013 BL|76}}. It additionally had the most eccentric orbit of any known minor planet, with its distance from the Sun varying by about 99.9% during the course of its orbit, followed by {{mpl|2005 VX|3}} with an eccentricity of 0.9973. On January 30, 2016, it was classified as a comet when it was 5.7 AU from the Sun.&lt;ref name="MPEC2016-C01"/&gt; It comes close to [[Jupiter]], and a close approach in the past threw it on the distant orbit it is on now.

Though the comet nucleus was probably mildly active, early asteroidal estimates gave an [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude (H)]] of 12.3,&lt;ref name=JPL13/&gt; which would suggest a nucleus as large as 8–20&amp;nbsp;km in diameter. But it could easily be half that size due to activity brightening the nucleus.

==2017 perihelion==
{{mp|2015 ER|61}} was discovered on March 15, 2015 when it was 8.44 AU from the Sun,&lt;ref name=DPS2016/&gt; and magnitude 21.5.&lt;ref name="MPEC2016-C01"/&gt; By early February 2016, the object reached magnitude 20, and made a close approach to Jupiter on March 28, 2016 of 0.9245 AU.&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; This changed its orbit, significantly decreasing its aphelion distance from 1430 AU to ~1200 AU, and as it passes through the inner Solar System its aphelion decreases to 770 AU, and by 2020 will have an aphelion of 854 AU.

The barycentric orbital period will decrease from 19000 years (epoch 1950) to 9000 years (epoch 2050).

As of January 2017, it was magnitude 13, and increasing in brightness. On April 4, 2017, it was detected outbursting to magnitude 6.5. On April 19, 2017, it will reach its closest point to Earth of ~1.2 AU. At this point, it will be about [[apparent magnitude]] 8,&lt;ref name="Yoshida"/&gt; and, assuming a size of 20&amp;nbsp;km, have an apparent size of 19 [[Milliarcsecond|mas]]. It will come to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) on May 10, 2017.&lt;ref name=mpc/&gt; It will not be 50 AU from the Sun until 2045.

{{note|2}}{{note|3}} Because {{mp|2015 ER|61}}'s orbit takes it so far from the Sun, a more accurate value for its orbit is a barycentric solution. Additionally, a close approach to Jupiter in 2016, and a travel through the inner solar system in 2017 drastically changes its orbit. Therefore, orbits for 2000–2016 and 2018–2100 are provided, respectively.

'''Coconut timber''' is a [[hardwood]]-substitute from [[coconut]] palm trees. It is referred to in the [[Philippines]] as '''Coconut Lumber''', or '''Coco Lumber''', and elsewhere additionally as '''Cocowood'''.&lt;ref name=cocowood &gt;{{Cite web
  |url=http://www.cocowood.net/ 
  |title=Development of advanced veneer and other product from coconut wood to enhance livelihoods in South Pacific communities
  |publisher=[cocowood.net]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a new timber resource that comes from plantation crops and offers an alternative to rainforest timber.

== Background ==
Coconut timber comes from farmed plantations of old coconut palms. The coconut palm was planted as a crop in large plantations throughout the tropics in the early half of the 20th century in order to harvest the coconut fruit. The tree bears fruit until approximately 70 years of age, at which point it is considered to have reached the end of its economic life and is felled to make way for future crops. Each year, several million palms are felled throughout the tropics. Traditionally, the trunks have been wasted by-products from this process.

Only in very recent years have people begun to explore the potential commercial uses for this vast, alternative supply of timber. This led to the commercial launch of coconut timber in a range of different products, from flooring to posts to furniture. With these products performing at equal to or even better than conventional hardwoods, coconut timber represents a viable substitute for endangered hardwoods from an ecologically-sound source.

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Coconut Tree - തെങ്ങ് 05.JPG|thumb|Coconut trunk, showing typical grain of coconut wood]]
Its wood is reminiscent in appearance to mahogany; however, coconut timber has a much more fibrous grain than mahogany and lacks mahogany's iridescence. Colour tones and hues range from golden to near ebony, with dark brown flecks. There are three basic colour divisions relating to the timber's density: dark brown tones (high density); medium brown tones (medium density); and light golden tones (low density).

Coconut trees have no annual growth rings, rays, heartwood or branches, meaning that coconut timber is free from knots and other such imperfections.

== Properties ==
The coconut palm is a [[monocotyledon]]. It has a smooth, slender stem that grows to a height of about 25 metres and with an average diameter of 300&amp;nbsp;mm. The hardest, densest part of the wood is found on the outer perimeter of the trunk, which gives the tree its strength, while the wood’s high silica content gives the tree elasticity. Towards the centre of the trunk, the wood gets less hard. The wood has a [[Janka hardness test|Janka ball hardness]] of 112,5 - 154,7 kgf/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1600 – 2200 psi), which is greater than that of [[oak]] (70,3 - 84,4 kgf/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[Douglas-fir]] (35,9 kgf/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Coconut timber is classified according to three degrees of density:
* High-density timber (dermal) – hard: 600–900&amp;nbsp;kg/m³
* Medium-density timber (sub-dermal) – medium/hard: 400–600&amp;nbsp;kg/m³
* Low-density timber (core) – soft/medium: 200–400&amp;nbsp;kg/m³

== Uses ==
[[Image:Palmwood house 2.JPG|thumb|right|Coconut timber house in London]]
Coconut timber has many applications as both a structural and interior design material. The harder, high-density timber is suitable for general structural purposes such as pillars, trusses, rafting, furniture, window and door frames, floors, decking and floor joists. Medium density coconut timber can be used for walls, ceiling joists and horizontal studs. Low density coconut timber is used in non-load bearing applications like wood panelling, internal trim and ceilings, as well as homewares.
Coconut timber supplied by [[Pacific Green]] is to be used in exterior applications throughout Abu Dhabi's [[Masdar City]] development, including the entrance gates, screens and doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laylin|first=Tafline|title=Pacific Green Inaugurates Masdar City’s Sustainable Palm Gates|url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2011/02/pacific-green-masdar-gates/|publisher=Green Prophet|date=2011-02-10|accessdate=2012-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local development ==
Coconut timber is a source of income for less developed South Pacific island communities. The previously low value senile coconut trunks have been promoted as a source of veneer and other wood products.&lt;ref name=cocowood /&gt;

The '''colossal squid''' (''Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni'', from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''mesos'' (middle), ''onycho'' (claw, nail), and ''teuthis'' ([[squid]])), sometimes called the '''Antarctic squid''' or '''giant cranch squid''', is believed to be the [[Cephalopod size|largest squid species in terms of mass]]. It is the only known member of the [[genus]] ''Mesonychoteuthis''. It is known from only a few specimens, and current estimates put its maximum size at {{Convert|12|–|14|m|abbr=on}} long and weighing possibly up to {{convert|750|kg}},&lt;ref name="unmuseum.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unmuseum.org/colossalsquid.htm|title=The UnMuseum - The Colossal Squid|website=www.unmuseum.org|access-date=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderton, H.J. 2007.

New Zealand Government website.&lt;/ref&gt; based on analysis of smaller and immature specimens, making it the largest-known [[invertebrate]].

==Morphology==
Unlike the [[giant squid]], whose [[cephalopod arm|arms]] and [[tentacle]]s have only suckers lined with small teeth, the colossal squid's limbs are also equipped with sharp hooks: some swivelling, others three-pointed.&lt;ref name="suckershooks"&gt;[http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2008/04/30/hooks-and-suckers/ Te Papa: Hooks and Suckers]. Blog.tepapa.govt.nz (2008-04-30). Retrieved on 2011-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Its body is wider and stouter, and therefore heavier, than that of the giant squid. Colossal squid are believed to have longer [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantles]] than the giant squid, but shorter tentacles.

The squid exhibits [[abyssal gigantism]]. The beak of ''M.&amp;nbsp;hamiltoni'' is the largest known of any squid, and more robust than that of the giant squid. The colossal squid also has the largest [[cephalopod eye|eyes]] documented in the animal kingdom; a partly collapsed specimen measured {{convert|27|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, with a {{convert|9|cm|abbr=on}} pupil.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Colossal squid to give up its secrets|url = http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/254685/colossal-squid-to-give-up-its-secrets|accessdate = 2015-08-02|publisher = Radio New Zealand|date = 16 September 2014|last = Ballance|first = Alison|last2 = Meduna|first2 = Veronika}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eye /&gt; The eye was estimated to be {{convert|30|to|40|cm}} when the squid was alive.

==Distribution==
The squid's known range extends thousands of kilometres north of [[Antarctica]] to southern [[South America]], southern [[South Africa]], and the southern tip of [[New Zealand]], making it primarily an inhabitant of the entire circumantarctic [[Southern Ocean]].&lt;ref name=review&gt;Rosa, Rui &amp; Lopes, Vanessa M. &amp; Guerreiro, Miguel &amp; Bolstad, Kathrin &amp; Xavier, José C. 2017.

''Polar Biology'', published online on March 30, 2017. {{DOI|10.1007/s00300-017-2104-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology and life history==
Little is known about the life of this creature, but it is believed to feed on prey such as [[chaetognatha]], large [[fish]] such as the [[Patagonian toothfish]], and smaller squid in the deep [[ocean]] using [[bioluminescence]]. A recent study by Remeslo, Yakushev and Laptikhovsky revealed that [[Antarctic toothfish]] make up a significant part of the colossal squid's diet; of the 8,000 toothfish brought aboard trawlers between 2011 and 2014, seventy-one showed clear signs of attack by colossal squid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Colossal squid vs huge toothfish – clash of the deep-sea titans|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27701-colossal-squid-vs-huge-toothfish-clash-of-the-deep-sea-titans/|accessdate = 2015-08-02|first = Penny|last = Sarchet|date = 11 June 2015|website = New Scientist|doi = 10.1080/00222933.2015.1040477}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colossal squid is thought to have a very slow [[metabolic rate]], needing only around {{convert|30|g|oz}} of prey daily for an adult with a mass of {{convert|500|kg}}.&lt;ref name=slow&gt;Rosa, R. &amp; B.A. Seibel 2010. Slow pace of life of the Antarctic colossal squid. ''Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom'', published online on April 20, 2010. {{DOI|10.1017/S0025315409991494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of its energy requirements suggest it is a slow-moving [[ambush predator]], using its large eyes primarily for prey-detection rather than engaging in active hunting.&lt;ref name=slow /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Huge 'monster squid' not fearsome|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8664000/8664542.stm|newspaper = BBC News|date = 2010-05-07|access-date = 2015-08-02|first = Jody|last = Bourton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on capture depths of a few specimens, and [[Cephalopod beak|beaks]] found in [[sperm whale]] stomachs, the adult colossal squid ranges at least to a depth of {{convert|2.2|km|ft|abbr=on}}, and juveniles can go as deep as {{convert|1|km|ft|abbr=on}}. It is believed to be [[sexually dimorphic]], with mature females generally being much larger than mature males, as is common in many species of [[invertebrate]]s.

The squid's method of reproduction has not been observed, although some data on their reproduction can be inferred from anatomy. Since males lack an organ called a [[hectocotylus]] (an arm used in other [[cephalopod]]s to transfer a [[spermatophore]] to the female), they probably use a [[penis]] instead, which would be used to directly implant sperm into females.

Many sperm whales have scars on their backs, believed to be caused by the hooks of colossal squid. Colossal squid are a major prey item for sperm whales in the Antarctic; 14% of the squid beaks found in the stomachs of these sperm whales are those of the colossal squid, which indicates that colossal squid make up 77% of the biomass consumed by these whales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.R. | year = 1980 | title = Cephalopoda in the diet of sperm whales of the southern hemisphere and their bearing on sperm whale biology | url = | journal = Discovery Reports | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 1–324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other animals also feed on colossal squid, including [[beaked whale]]s (such as the [[southern bottlenose whale]]), [[pilot whale]]s, [[southern elephant seal]]s, [[Patagonian toothfish]], [[sleeper shark]]s (''[[Somniosus antarcticus]]''), and [[albatross]]es (e.g., the [[wandering albatross|wandering]] and [[sooty albatross]]es).&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; However, beaks from mature adults have only been recovered from large predators (i.e. sperm whales and [[Somniosidae|sleeper sharks]]), while the other predators only eat juveniles or young adults.&lt;ref&gt;Cherel, Y. &amp; G.

==History==
{{main|List of colossal squid specimens and sightings}}

The species was first discovered in the form of two tentacles found in the stomach of a [[sperm whale]] in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Robson, G.C. 1925. On ''Mesonychoteuthis'', a new genus of oegopsid, Cephalopoda. ''Annals and Magazine of Natural History'', Series 9, '''16''': 272–277.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981,  a Russian trawler in the [[Ross Sea]], off the coast of [[Antarctica]], caught a large squid with a total length of over {{convert|4|m|abbr=on}}, which was later identified as an immature female of ''M. hamiltoni''.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, R. 1998. ''The Search for the Giant Squid''. The Lyons Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 a complete specimen of a subadult female was found near the surface with a total length of {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} and a mantle length of {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Super squid surfaces in Antarctic|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2910849.stm|newspaper = BBC News|date = 2003-04-02|access-date = 2015-08-02|last = Griggs|first = Kim|publication-place = Wellington}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specimen shows that colossal squids may grow larger than {{convert|500|kg|abbr=on}}, possibly up to {{convert|750|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="unmuseum.org"/&gt;

In 2005 a specimen was captured at a depth of {{convert|1625|m|abbr=on}} while taking a [[toothfish]] from a [[long-line fishing|longline]] off [[South Georgia Island]]. Although the mantle was not brought aboard, the mantle length was estimated at over {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}}, and the tentacles measured {{convert|2.3|m|abbr=on}}. The animal is thought to have weighed between {{convert|150|and|200|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Very Rare Giant Squid Caught Alive|url = http://www.sgisland.gs/pages/main/news23.htm|website = South Georgia Island|accessdate = 2015-08-02|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100605011459/http://www.sgisland.gs/pages/main/news23.htm|archivedate = 2010-06-05|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest recorded specimen was captured in 2007 by a New Zealand fishing boat off Antarctica. It was initially estimated to measure {{convert|4.5|m|abbr=on}} in length and weigh {{convert|450|kg|abbr=on}}.

On February 22, 2007, authorities in New Zealand announced the largest known colossal squid had been captured. The specimen weighed {{convert|495|kg}} and was initially estimated to measure {{convert|4.5|m}} in total length.&lt;ref&gt;onboard scientific observer&lt;/ref&gt; Fishermen on the vessel ''San Aspiring'', owned by the Sanford Seafood Company, caught the animal in the freezing Antarctic waters of the [[Ross Sea]]. It was brought to the surface as it fed on an [[Antarctic toothfish]] that had been caught off a long line. It would not let go of its prey and could not be removed from the line by the fishermen, so they decided to catch it instead. They managed to envelop it in a net, haul it aboard, and freeze it. The specimen eclipsed the previous largest find in 2003 by about {{convert|195|kg}},&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10430435"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10430435 |title=NZ's colossal squid to be microwaved |author=Marks, Kathy |date=March 23, 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = New giant squid predator found|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3370019.stm|accessdate = 14 February 2007|work = BBC News|date = 8 January 2004|last = Rincon|first = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is still considerably smaller than some estimates for this species have predicted.

'''Differentiation-inducing factor''' (DIF) is one of a class of [[Effector (biology)|effector molecules]] that induce changes in cell chemistry, inhibiting growth and promoting [[cellular differentiation|differentiation of cell type]].  This name has been given to several factors before it was clear if they were the same or different effectors.  More recently DIFs have garnered interest with their potential [[tumor]] inhibiting properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = DIF-1, Putative Morphogen ofD. discoideum,Suppresses Cell Growth and Promotes Retinoic Acid-Induced Cell Differentiation in HL-60|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X97969643|journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|date = 1997-07-18|pages = 418–422|volume = 236|issue = 2|doi = 10.1006/bbrc.1997.6964|first = Yuzuru|last = Kubohara}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DIFs have also been used to help regulate plant growth.

== Differentiation-inducing Factors 1-3 ==

=== Initial studies ===

''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'' has been used since the 1940s to study cellular and developmental biology.&lt;ref&gt;Raper, K. B. J., ''Elisha Mitchell Scientific Soc.'', '''56''', 241–282 (1940).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is well-suited for this research because it only develops two types of cells (stalk and spore) during [[morphogenesis]].  Each cell type has a distinct physical origin within the organism; pre-stalk cells coming from the anterior side and pre-spore cells from the posterior. Early evidence showed the differentiation of dense patches of pre-stalk cells were induced by [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cyclic AMP (cAMP)]] along with "a factor" that was likely low in molecular weight and able to diffuse across membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cell differentiation without morphogenesis in Dictyostelium discoideum|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v262/n5570/abs/262717a0.html|journal = Nature|date = 1976-08-19|pages = 717–719|volume = 262|issue = 5570|doi = 10.1038/262717a0|first = C. D.|last = Town|first2 = J. D.|last2 = Gross|first3 = R. R.|last3 = Kay|bibcode = 1976Natur.262..717T}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The structures for DIF-1, DIF-2, and DIF-3 were identified as these factors for stalk differentiation and subsequently synthesized to further research into implications for developmental biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Differentiation-inducing factor from the slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum and its analogues. Synthesis, structure and biological activity.|journal = Biochemical Journal|date = 1988-11-15|issn = 0264-6021|pmc = 1135362|pmid = 3223901|pages = 23–28|volume = 256|issue = 1|first = M S|last = Masento|first2 = H R|last2 = Morris|first3 = G W|last3 = Taylor|first4 = S J|last4 = Johnson|first5 = A C|last5 = Skapski|first6 = R R|last6 = Kay|doi=10.1042/bj2560023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Structure elucidation of two differentiation inducing factors (DIF-2 and DIF-3) from the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum.|journal = Biochemical Journal|date = 1988-02-01|issn = 0264-6021|pmc = 1148792|pmid = 3355503|pages = 903–906|volume = 249|issue = 3|first = H R|last = Morris|first2 = M S|last2 = Masento|first3 = G W|last3 = Taylor|first4 = K A|last4 = Jermyn|first5 = R R|last5 = Kay|doi=10.1042/bj2490903}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DIFs 1-3 are chlorinated hexaphenones (phenylalkan-1-ones, with chloro, hydroxy and methoxy substitution on the [[benzene ring]]), and have been isolated from ''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'' [[slime mold]].

Some research has shown that they have a role in controlling [[chemotaxis]] of ''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'', too.  DIF-1 and DIF-3 are related in structure and function.  DIF-3 is formed from the first step in the breakdown of DIF-1.  In this state DIF-3 only performs about 3.5% as much of the activity of its predecessor.  DIF-2 is unrelated to DIFs -1 and -3, but it works 40% as well as DIF-1 does to induce differentiation in stalk cells.  Despite this similarity in function during differentiation, DIFs -1 and -2 act very differently in chemotactic movement of the cells toward cAMP.  DIF-1 has a slight inhibitory effect on movement of starved cells toward cAMP, while DIF-2 has a strong positive effect of movement of these cells toward cAMP.  These effects are thought to be carried out through [[phosphodiesterase]] activations that impact [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]] production to impact chemotaxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Differentiation-Inducing Factor-1 and -2 Function also as Modulators for Dictyostelium Chemotaxis|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006658|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2009-08-17|pmc = 2722026|pmid = 19684855|pages = e6658|volume = 4|issue = 8|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0006658|first = Hidekazu|last = Kuwayama|first2 = Yuzuru|last2 = Kubohara|bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.6658K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An increase in chemotaxis can be related to malignant migration of cancer cells.

=== Anti-tumor properties ===

Investigation into the anti-tumor properties of DIFs have followed one main line; the disruption of a pathway necessary for the cancer's uncontrolled growth reducing its proliferative ability.  As mentioned above, the ability of DIF-1 to decrease movement of proliferating cells toward sources of energy could serve as an anti-tumor property.  In another example, DIF-1 has been shown to reduce the proliferation of gastric cancer cells via upregulation of the [[MAPK/ERK pathway|MEK-ERK-dependent pathway]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Differentiation-inducing factor-1 (DIF-1) inhibits STAT3 activity involved in gastric cancer cell proliferation via MEK-ERK-dependent pathway|url = http://www.nature.com/onc/journal/v22/n4/full/1206109a.html|journal = Oncogene|date = 2003-01-01|issn = 0950-9232|pages = 548–554|volume = 22|issue = 4|doi = 10.1038/sj.onc.1206109|first = Masashi|last = Kanai|first2 = Yoshitaka|last2 = Konda|first3 = Toshio|last3 = Nakajima|first4 = Yoshio|last4 = Izumi|first5 = Naoki|last5 = Kanda|first6 = Apichart|last6 = Nanakin|first7 = Yuzuru|last7 = Kubohara|first8 = Tsutomu|last8 = Chiba|pmid=12555068}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Other studies have shown how complicated the anti-tumor interactions of DIFs may be, especially when considering the indirect impacts DIFs have on target molecules.  For instance, DIF-like molecules have been shown to inhibit cell growth and bring about cell death through [[Uncoupling protein|uncoupling in mitochondria]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mitochondria Are the Target Organelle of Differentiation-Inducing Factor-3, an Anti-Tumor Agent Isolated from Dictyostelium Discoideum|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0072118|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2013-08-15|pmc = 3744471|pmid = 23977224|pages = e72118|volume = 8|issue = 8|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0072118|first = Yuzuru|last = Kubohara|first2 = Haruhisa|last2 = Kikuchi|first3 = Yusuke|last3 = Matsuo|first4 = Yoshiteru|last4 = Oshima|first5 = Yoshimi|last5 = Homma|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...872118K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expanding uses for DIF-like molecules ===

More recent focus has been on the potential therapeutic effects DIF-like molecules.  Derivatives of DIF-1 and DIF-3 have already been investigated with promising initial results.  One group of derivatives yielded two DIF-1-like compounds that were effective in suppression of [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]] production which could be helpful in controlling [[Sepsis|septic responses]] and other infections.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Development of novel DIF-1 derivatives that selectively suppress innate immune responses|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089615005210|journal = Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry|date = 2015-08-01|pages = 4311–4315|volume = 23|issue = 15|doi = 10.1016/j.bmc.2015.06.027|first = Van Hai|last = Nguyen|first2 = Haruhisa|last2 = Kikuchi|first3 = Yuzuru|last3 = Kubohara|first4 = Katsunori|last4 = Takahashi|first5 = Yasuhiro|last5 = Katou|first6 = Yoshiteru|last6 = Oshima|pmid=26122773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monaco declaration ==
The ocean scientists expressed their concern in Monaco 30.1.2009 about the [[global warming]] consequences in the seas. 150 leading scientists appealed to the decision makers in ”the Monaco declaration” to restrict the CO2 emissions. Today’s emissions could have dramatic consequences in the stocks of  fish in a few decades, which would influence significantly both in the ocean biodiversity and also millions of peoples food supply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/luonto_ja_ymparisto/2009/01/tutkijoiden_hatahuuto_ilmastonmuutos_happamoittaa_meret_516308.html  Tutkijoiden hätähuuto: Ilmastonmuutos happamoittaa meret] YLE 31.01.2009  {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geothermal energy is the second most used form of renewable energy in Russia but represents less than 1% of the total energy production. The first geothermal power plant in Russia was built at Pauzhetka, Kamchatka, in 1966, with a capacity of 5 MW. The total geothermal installed capacity in 2005 was 79 MW, with 50 MW coming from a plant at Verkhne-Mutnovsky. Russia is currently developing a 100 MW plant at Mutnovsky and a 50 MW plant in Kaliningrad.&lt;ref&gt;"2007 Survey of Energy Resources" (PDF). World Energy Council 2007. 2007. Archived from the original (PDF) on 9 April 2011. Retrieved 23 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Most geothermal resources are currently used for heating settlements in the North Caucasus and Kamchatka.
Half of the geothermal production is used to heat homes and industrial buildings, one third is used to heat greenhouses and 13% is used for industrial processes.

Five major geothermal power plants exist in Russia.

Potential resources include the Northern Caucasus, Western Siberia, Lake Baikal, and in Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands.&lt;ref&gt;https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/db/WGC/papers/WGC/2015/01061.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2906">[[File:Ionospheric absorption (en).svg|thumb|right|350px|Attenuation diagram, day and night]]
'''Ionospheric absorption''' (or ISAB) is the scientific name for [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] occurring as a result of the interaction between various types of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] and the free electrons in the [[ionosphere]], which can interfere with [[radio]] transmissions.

==Description==
Ionosphere absorption is of critical importance when [[radio network]]s, telecommunication systems or interlinked radio systems are being planned, particularly when trying to determine [[Radio propagation|propagation]] conditions.&lt;ref name="walk"&gt;Walker, J.K. ; Bhatnagar, V.P. Ionospheric absorption, typical ionization, conductivity, and possible synoptic heating parameters in the [[Earth\'s atmosphere|upper atmosphere]]. Geological Survey of Canada.http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=6068491&lt;/ref&gt;

The ionosphere can be described as an area of the atmosphere in which [[Radio frequency|radio waves]] on [[shortwave bands]] are refracted or reflected back to earth. As a result of this reflection, which is often key in the long-distance propagation of radio waves,some of the shortwave [[signal strength]] is decreased. In this regard, ISAB is the primary [[limiting factor]] in radio propagation.&lt;ref name="dav"&gt;{{cite book

|publisher=Peter Peregrinus Ltd/The Institution of Electrical Engineers
|location=London, UK
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attenuation mechanics==
[[File:RIOM2.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Chart of Attenuation]]
ISAB is only a factor in the period of the day where radio signals travel through the portion of the ionosphere facing the sun. The [[solar wind]] and radiation cause the ionosphere to become charged with electrons in the first place. At night, the atmosphere becomes drained of its charge, and radio signals can go much farther with less loss of signal. In particular, low frequency signals that would be attenuated to nothing during the day will be received much farther away at night.&lt;ref name="har"&gt;John Keith Hargreaves. The Solar-Terrestrial Environment: An Introduction to Geospace. 1992 Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-42737-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leo"&gt;Leo F. McNamara. (1994) {{ISBN|0-89464-804-7}} Radio Amateurs Guide to the Ionosphere.&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific amount of attenuation can be derived as a function of the [[Inverse-square law]]. The lower the frequency, the greater the attenuation.&lt;ref name="dav"/&gt;

Relative ionospheric absorption can be measured using a [[riometer]].

[[Lonnie Johnson (inventor)|Lonnie Johnson]] invented it and claims the converter exhibits an energy conversion efficiency of as much as 60% compared to the 30% efficiency typical of the best photovoltaic cells; however, this claim is at a theoretical level based on comparison with a [[Carnot cycle]] and assumes a temperature gradient of 600C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Mechanism of action==
The JTEC converts heat into electrical energy by compressing and expanding hydrogen gas.  It operates as a closed system with no moving classical mechanical parts, requires no input of fuel, and creates no exhaust.  The engine consists of two stages: A low-temperature [[compression stage]] and a high-temperature [[power stage]].  Each stage consists of a working fluid chamber that a copper lined [[membrane electrode assembly]] (MEA) bisects.  A MEA is a proprietary ceramic [[proton exchange membrane]] (PEM) that is sandwiched between two electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | last = Johnson
  | first = Lonnie G.
  | title = High efficiency solid state engine 
  | publisher = PARC
  | date = 2009-01-29
  | url = http://www.parc.com/event/713/high-efficiency-solid-state-engine.html
  | accessdate = 2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the high-temperature power stage, expanding high pressure hydrogen from the compression stage converts the heat energy into electrical energy via the MEA.  As the high-temperature, high pressure hydrogen is forced through the PEM it is [[Ionization|ionized]], producing [[protons]] and [[electrons]].  The protons pass through the membrane while the electrodes expel the electrons through a load.  After passing through the PEM, the protons recombine with the electrons to produce low pressure hydrogen gas that flows out to the compression stage.  From the perspective of the high-temperature stage, the load consists of the external load on the engine and the low-temperature compression stage.  In the compression stage, electrical potential is applied across the MEA and forces protons to flow through the PEM to produce high pressure hydrogen.  As the hydrogen travels between the stages, it passes through a [[heat exchanger]] that increases efficiency by helping to keep the high-temperature stage hot and the low-temperature stage cool.

The amount of energy available to the external load is the difference in electrical potential between that needed to compress hydrogen at low-temperature and that which expanding it at high-temperature generates.  Unlike other heat pump devices, the JTEC requires an initial input of electrical energy to start the compression stage and initiate the cycle.  The engine can also be operated in reverse to convert electrical energy into a temperature differential, for example in HVAC applications.  In the proposed application, [[Sunlight|solar irradiance]] would heat the power stage and the compression stage connect to an ambient temperature [[heat sink]].

==Applications==
The scalability of the engine leads its developers to claim that its potential applications range from providing power for [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) to functioning as large-scale [[power plant]]s.

The converter can use many diverse forms of fuel without the need for fuel-specific customization as seen in internal combustion engines and generate power from fuel combustion, solar irradiance, low grade [[waste heat]] from industry, or such other power generation systems as fuel cells, internal combustion engines, or turbines because it functions as an [[external combustion engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* 1996: On April 15, a rupture, followed by an explosion and fire at 1829 EST, occurred on the TransCanada PipeLines Limited 864-millimetre (34-inch) natural gas pipeline, at Kilometre Post Mainline Valve 39-2 + 6.07 kilometres, 10 kilometres southwest of Winnipeg, near the town of [[St. Norbert, Manitoba]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/1996/p96h0012/p96h0012.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1997: On April 30, a rupture occurred on the Westcoast Energy Inc. 219.1-millimetre (8-inch) outside diameter Monias pipeline at Mile Post 20, near [[Fort St. John, British Columbia]]. Approximately 85,000 cubic metres of sour natural gas was released and ignited.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/1997/p97h0024/p97h0024.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1997: On December 2, a rupture occurred at an area of external corrosion on the TransCanada PipeLines Limited 914-millimetre outside diameter Line 100-3 at main line valve 5-3 + 15.049 kilometres, near [[Cabri, Saskatchewan]]. Approximately 3 252 × 10^3 cubic metres of natural gas was released as a result of the rupture. The gas ignited immediately, resulting in damage to the surrounding soil and vegetation. The main fire self-extinguished within 20 minutes of the line break.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/1997/p97h0063/p97h0063.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1999: On May 20, Line 3 on the [[Enbridge]] Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge) pipeline system ruptured, releasing 3 123 cubic metres (m3) (20,600 barrels) of Cold Lake heavy crude oil, east of [[Regina, Saskatchewan]]. Approximately 3.6 hectares (ha) (8.8 acres) of farmland was affected by crude oil.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/1999/p99h0021/p99h0021.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2000: On December 28, a release of natural gas resulted in an explosion that destroyed the electrical and services building, heavily damaged the compressor building, and damaged the remaining buildings at the East Hereford compressor station, approximately 80 km SE of [[Magog, Quebec]]. Before the occurrence, the station had been shut down due to an unintentional manual initiation of the station's emergency shutdown system. Following the emergency shutdown of the compressor station, a maintenance person was sent to the station to reinitiate the electric motor-driven compressor unit. During the day, after repeatedly trying to get the station into the ready state mode, to return the station to normal pipeline operations, an explosion occurred. The on-site maintenance person was seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/2000/p00h0061/p00h0061.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2001: On January 17, a rupture occurred on the [[Enbridge]] Pipelines Inc. 864-millimetre outside diameter Line 3/4 at Mile Post 109.42, 0.8 kilometres downstream of the Hardisty pump station near [[Hardisty, Alberta]]. The rupture occurred in a permanent slough that was fed by an underground spring. Although the line was shut down at the control centre in Edmonton, Alberta, within minutes of the rupture, the exact location of the rupture was not found until after 13 hours. Approximately 3800 cubic metres of crude oil was released and contained within a 2.7-hectare section. As of 01 May 2001, 3760 cubic metres of crude oil had been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/2001/p01h0004/p01h0004.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2001: On September 29, a rupture occurred on the [[Enbridge]] Pipelines Inc. 508-millimetreoutside diameter Line 10 at Mile Post 1885.64, near [[Binbrook, Ontario]]. Line 10 transports crude oil from Westover, Ontario, to Buffalo, New York, United States. The rupture occurred in an agricultural field planted with soybeans. Within eight minutes of the rupture, the control centre operator in Edmonton, Alberta, shut the line down and began to sectionalize it. Remedial action response teams contained the spill to two general areas, a natural swale running perpendicular to the pipeline and the pipeline trench. Approximately 95 cubic metres of crude oil were released, affecting a 0.67-hectaresection of land.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/2001/p01h0049/p01h0049.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2002: On April 14, a rupture occurred on the 914-millimetre-diameter natural gas transmission pipeline, at a zone of near-neutral (low) pH stress corrosion cracking, on Line 100-3of the TransCanada PipeLines, at main-line valve 31-3 + 5.539 kilometres, approximately two kilometres from the village of [[Brookdale, Manitoba]]. Following the rupture, the sweet natural gas ignited. With the automatic closure of main-line valves upstream and downstream of the rupture site, the fire self-extinguished at 0230, on 15 April 2002. There were no injuries. As a precautionary measure, approximately 100 people were evacuated from the occurrence area within a four-kilometre radius, including the village of Brookdale, for a period of one day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/2002/p02h0017/p02h0017.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2002: A refined product pipeline rupture near [[Saint-Clet, Quebec]], on Dec 7, from Trans Northern Pipelines Inc. 273.1&amp;nbsp;mm diameter mainline kilometer post 63.57, estimated 32 cubic meters of low sulphur diesel released to area and drainage systems. Transportation Safety Board Investigation Report Number P02H0052. http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/2002/p02h0052/p02h0052.asp
* 2003: A backhoe punctured a pipeline in [[Etobicoke, Ontario]] the [[2003 Etobicoke gas explosion|resulting explosion]] killed 7 people
* 2005: On July 15, an employee of Terasen Pipelines (Trans Mountain) Inc. discovered crude oil on the pipeline right-of-way, on the north side of Ward Road, [[Abbotsford, British Columbia]]. Before the discovery, the company had been delivering crude oil out of the Sumas Tank Farm, when it received odour complaints from local residents. Approximately 210 cubic metres of crude oil was released into the surrounding area and made its way into Kilgard Creek. There were no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/2005/p05h0044/p05h0044.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2007: A crude oil pipeline owned and operated by [[Kinder Morgan Energy Partners]] was ruptured by an excavator digging a storm sewer trench in [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Cleanup continues on B.C. oil spill | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/07/24/bc-oilspill.html | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2007: On 15 April, a rupture occurred on Enbridge Pipelines’ 864-millimetre outside diameter Line 3 at Mile Post 506.2217 downstream of the Glenavon pump station near [[Glenavon, Saskatchewan]]. The rupture occurred in a wetland area of farmland. Approximately 990 cubic meters of crude oil were released, of which approximately 912 cubic meters were recovered. There were no injuries. The cause was determined to be corrosion cracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/2007/p07h0014/p07h0014.asp|title=Pipeline Investigation Report P07H0014|first=Government of Canada, Transportation Safety Board of|last=Canada|website=www.tsb.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2007: On July 24, the 610-millimetre (24-inch) Westridge Dock Transfer Line, owned by Trans Mountain Pipeline L.P. and operated by Kinder Morgan Canada Inc., was struck and punctured by a contractor's excavator bucket while the contractor was excavating a trench for a new storm sewer line along Inlet Drive in [[Burnaby, British Columbia]]. When the pipeline was punctured, approximately 234 cubic metres of crude oil was released, approximately 210 cubic metres of which was recovered. Crude oil flowed into Burrard Inlet Bay via the Burnaby storm sewer system. Eleven houses were sprayed with crude oil; many other residential properties required restoration and approximately 250 residents voluntarily left their homes. There were no explosions, fires, or injuries resulting from this occurrence; however, emergency workers and two firefighters responding to the incident were sprayed with crude oil. Two members of the public were also sprayed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/2007/p07h0040/p07h0040.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2009: A July 20 [[Alberta]] pipeline explosion &amp; fire involved a [[TransCanada Corporation]] natural gas pipeline. The explosion, which sent 50 meter flames into the air, destroyed a two-hectare wooded area. The NEB said the delay in releasing the report was caused by an "administrative error", when an employee left without transferring the file over. The Peace River Mainline pipeline, built in 1968, had ruptured six times and leaked on 17 occasions until 2014. The line ruptured in 2009 due to corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Pipeline rupture: Alberta resident unaware of 2009 blast | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/pipeline-rupture-alberta-resident-unaware-of-2009-blast-1.2525030 | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2009: On 12 September 2009, [[TransCanada Corporation]]'s Gas Control received notification, from the Englehart Fire Department through its Emergency Notification Line, of an explosion and fire south of its Compressor Station 107, located near [[Swastika, Ontario]]. At the time of the occurrence, TransCanada was transporting sweet natural gas. Escaping gas from a pipeline rupture had ignited, resulting in the explosion. A large crater was created and two sections of pipe broke from the system, with one section being ejected approximately 150 metres from the rupture site. There were no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/2009/p09h0074/p09h0074.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2009: On 26 September 2009, [[TransCanada Corporation]]'s Line 100-1 ruptured, near [[Marten River, Ontario]]. At 1151, Gas Control at TransCanada's Calgary office became aware of this event when Main Line Valve 112-1, on the upstream side of Compressor Station 112, automatically shut off due to low pipeline pressure. At the time of the occurrence, TransCanada was transporting sweet natural gas. The escaping gas did not ignite. A large crater was created and pipe pieces were ejected from the failed pipeline section and spread around the occurrence site. There were no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/2009/p09h0083/p09h0083.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2009: On 29 September, an [[Enbridge]] crude oil pipeline, Line 2, leaked at Mile Post 474.7335, immediately downstream of the Odessa pump station near [[Odessa, Saskatchewan]]. The leak occurred at a crack within a shallow dent at the 6 o’clock position on the pipe. There were indications of gouging associated with the dent. The release occurred in a low lying, densely vegetated marsh. Approximately 175 cubic meters of crude oil was released, of which most was recovered. There were no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/pipeline/2009/p09h0084/p09h0084.pdf |format=PDF |title=PIPELINE INVESTIGATION REPORT : P09H0084 : Crude Oil Pipeline Leak |website=Tsb.gc.ca |accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2012
On September 18, 2012, twenty-two workers died when a gas leak from a [[Kinder Morgan]] pipeline at [[Reynosa]], [[Tamaulipas, Mexico]] sparked an explosion which became a fireball that overtook workers running for their lives, lead plaintiff Javier Alvarez del Castillo said. "They were engulfed in fire that burnt and singed every inch of skin from their head to their ankles, taking every bit of hair from their head, laying the plaintiffs 'skinless,' like skeletons bare to the bones, with in most cases only their footwear attached to the only portion of their body not reduced to skeleton."  He blamed Kinder Morgan for not adding enough of the odorant methyl mercaptan to the gas. (Natural gas is odorless, so energy companies add the sulfur compound to make leaks smelly and therefore noticeable.) "A gas company may be liable if facts show that it fails to act reasonably after having notice of defects in the pipes through which gas flows," the ruling states, citing the Texas appellate court case [[Entex Energy|Entex]], a Division of NorAm Energy Corp. v. Gonzalez.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron Langford, “Kinder Morgan on Hook for Blast That Killed 22,” Courthouse News Service, July 15, 2016, in https://www.workerscompensation.com/news_read.php?id=24257&amp;forgot=yes, accessed 2018-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13, 2016, a U.S. Federal Court ruled that only Kinder Morgan and not any of the other companies originally sued by plaintiffs’ groups should face the charges of gross negligence and negligence.&lt;ref&gt;"Kinder Morgan must defend fatal Mexican gas pipeline explosion court case," Hazardex, 2016.07.19, http://www.hazardexonthenet.net/article/121852/Kinder-Morgan-must-defend-fatal-Mexican-gas-pipeline-explosion-court-case.aspx, accessed 2018.01.07.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cause of the leak was a valve that apparently failed as workers performed routine testing, but gaps remain in what is known about the events that led up to the Reynosa explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Stevenson, “Mexico blast a blow to Pemex's improving safety,” Deseret News, September 20, 2012, at https://www.deseretnews.com/article/765605627/Mexico-blast-a-blow-to-Pemexs-improving-safety.html, accessed 2018.01.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent Wall Street Journal review found that there were 1,400 pipeline spills and accidents in the U.S. 2010–2013. According to the Journal review, four in every five pipeline accidents are discovered by local residents, not the companies that own the pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sider |first=Alison |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303754404579310920956322040?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303754404579310920956322040.html |title=Monitors Often Miss Oil Pipeline Leaks - WSJ |website=Online.wsj.com |date=2014-01-20 |accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/1/25/transcanada-naturalgaspipelineexpodesnearwinnipeg.html |title=TransCanada natural gas pipeline explodes near Winnipeg &amp;#124; Al Jazeera America |website=America.aljazeera.com |date=2014-01-25 |accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Explosion details'''

* 1965 (March 4) A 32-inch gas transmission pipeline, north of Natchitoches, Louisiana, belonging to the Tennessee Gas Pipeline exploded and burned from Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) on March 4, killing 17 people. At least 9 others were injured, and 7 homes 450 feet from the rupture were destroyed. The same pipeline had also had an explosion on May 9, 1955, just 930 feet (280 m) from the 1965 failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gendisasters.com/louisiana/53/natchitoches-la-gas-pipeline-explosion-mar-1965|title=Natchitoches, LA Gas Pipeline Explosion, Mar 1965 - GenDisasters ...

* 1999 (June 10) An Olympic gasoline pipeline ruptured near Bellingham, Washington, resulting in 3 deaths: a fly fisherman and two 10-year-old boys. The cause was a series of errors and malfunctions in relief systems and process control computer systems in the Olympic Pipeline system, resulting in 277,000 gallons of gasoline spilled to Whatcom Creek. The fire burned for five days.&lt;ref&gt;[[Olympic Pipeline explosion]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kira Millage |url=http://www.bellinghamherald.com/2009/06/07/938966/timeline-of-bellingham-pipeline.html |title=Timeline of Bellingham pipeline explosion |publisher=[[Bellingham Herald]] |date=2009-06-07 |accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2000 (19 August) A 30-inch El Paso Energy natural gas pipeline exploded, killing twelve people in southeast New Mexico. They were camping under a bridge which carried the pipeline across the Pecos River. The explosion occurred underground on the east side of the river 200 to 300 yards from the campers around 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.. The explosion left a crater 86 feet long, 46 feet wide and 20 feet deep. The fireball was visible 20 miles north in Carlsbad, N.M.

* 2004 (May 24) A pinhole-sized leak caused by wear unleashed thousands of gallons of gasoline that fueled the BP / Olympic pipeline fire and explosion near the Westfield Shoppingtown Southcenter in Renton, Washington. The blaze sent three firefighters to the hospital, and a mile-square area, which included a nearby fire station, was cordoned off. The leak occurred in a half-inch-wide tube of stainless steel that Olympic operators use to extract fuel samples from the system's 16-inch-wide main line. A metal electrical conduit had rubbed against the stainless steel sampling tube to open the pinhole leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Wear-caused-gas-leak-in-Olympic-pipeline-1145599.php |title=Wear caused gas leak in Olympic pipeline |website=Seattlepi.com |date=2004-05-24 |accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==

This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)
* releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. PHMSA Corrective Action Orders are at https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/CAO_opid_0.html. PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation-reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

* On January 4, 2009, a 6.625-inch storage well line operated by [[Columbia Gas Transmission]] Company in Elk View (near Charleston), Kanawha County, West Virginia, ruptured due to internal corrosion pitting, complicated by low impact toughness of the pipe material, causing $29,011 in damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/docs/CGT_GT_WV_20090104.pdf|title=US DoT report |date=August 2, 2011 |website=phmsa.dot.gov |publisher=US DoT}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 15, an accidental massive gas release at Pump Station 1 of the trans-Alaskan pipeline by [[Alyeska Pipeline Service Company]] threatened the site at the time. The company that runs the pipeline acknowledges a fire or explosion, had the gas ignited, could have imperiled the station's 60-plus workers and caused "an extended shutdown" of oil fields. There was no ignition or explosion. The incident occurred as BP workers used a cleaning device called a pig to swab oil out of an old pipeline the company was preparing to decommission. The 34-inch pipe was among major Prudhoe trunk lines found in 2006 to be ravaged with corrosion, due to BP's admitted lack of proper maintenance. A large volume of gas then bypassed the pig somehow, and rushed to Pump Station 1, a key asset through which every drop of oil coming off the North Slope must pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Wesley |last=Loy |url=http://www.adn.com/2009/02/06/682090/inquiry-launched-after-pump-station.html |title=Inquiry launched after pump station accident |publisher=ADN.com |date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927144559/http://www.adn.com/2009/02/06/682090/inquiry-launched-after-pump-station.html |archivedate=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 11, a gas pipeline exploded and burned near a natural gas treatment plant, near [[Carthage, Texas]].

* At approximately 5&amp;nbsp;p.m. on February 18, a rupture of pipeline near the pump station and terminal located in [[Cygnet, Ohio]], owned by Philadelphia-based [[Sunoco]], resulted in one of the largest oil spills in Wood County history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release by Sunoco Logistics |url=http://www.wtol.com/story/9873737/press-release-by-sunoco-logistics |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219083344/http://www.wtol.com/story/9873737/press-release-by-sunoco-logistics |archivedate=February 19, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon learning of the release, the company immediately shut down the pipeline, stopped operations at the pump station and terminal, notified the appropriate authorities, and began an emergency response. As of 11:05&amp;nbsp;a.m. ET on February 19, the release had been stopped from the pipe. The damaged pipeline, which was operating at the time, released crude oil into a farm field. Eventually, about 19,000 gallons of the 52,500 gallons released were recovered. Some of the crude oil did contaminate a local creek. There were no fatalities, or injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/article/20100730/NEWS16/7290358 |title=Ohio, Michigan score among highest for states with oil spills |publisher=Toledoblade.com |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pipeline Failure Investigation Report – 2-18-2009 |url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Files/Pipeline/Failure%20Reports/Mid_Valley_HL_OH_2009-02-18_508.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201174551/http://phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Files/Pipeline/Failure%20Reports/Mid_Valley_HL_OH_2009-02-18_508.pdf |archivedate=February 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dot.gov1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_12470.html?nocache=4784#_Incidents_tab_3|title=PHMSA: Stakeholder Communications - Operator Information|website=primis.phmsa.dot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 19, leaking gas was detected near homes, in [[Somerset, Massachusetts]]. Evacuations followed, but one resident who did not respond to knocking on doors was killed, when the gas exploded. Prior excavation damage to a gas main was the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/02/21/before_explosion_gas_crew_waved_off_help/|title=Before explosion, gas crew waved off help|first1=Brian|last1=Ballou|first2=David|last2=Abel|first3=Milton J.|last3=Valencia|date=February 21, 2009|publisher=|via=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 4, [[Kinder Morgan]]'s [[Florida Gas Transmission]] pipeline burst near Palm City and Hobe City, Florida (near [[Port Salerno, Florida]]). The explosion ejected 106 feet of buried pipe weighing about 5,000 pounds out of the ground and onto the right-of-way between Interstate 95 and the Florida Turnpike (SR-91). The rupture was near a high school that was within the 366-foot potential impact radius. Two people were injured when their car ran off the road, and a Sheriff's deputy walked through a dense cloud and inhaled natural gas. The escaping gas did not ignite. The pipe was manufactured in 1959. The leak caused $596,218 in property damage. FGT was cited for safety violations: failing to identify a high-consequence area, failing to test operators for alcohol and drugs, and failing to have prompt emergency response; PHMSA assessed a $95,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 2-2009-1002H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/220091002H/220091002H_CAO_05072009.pdf?nocache=4283 |accessdate=28 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080826/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/220091002H/220091002H_CAO_05072009.pdf?nocache=4283 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 5, a natural gas pipeline exploded and caught on fire, near [[Rockville, Indiana]] in Parke County, about {{convert|24|mi|km}} north of [[Terre Haute, Indiana]]. The cause of this failure was determined to be external corrosion. Additional work performed as a result of this order provided significant indications of external corrosion in various sections of this line. Pictures have been released around the area showing the damage caused. 52 people were evacuated in a one-mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) area of the explosion.

[[File:Ridge render.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Mid-oceanic ridge, including a [[black smoker]]]]
A '''mid-ocean ridge''' (MOR) is an [[underwater]] [[mountain system]] formed by [[plate tectonics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/842323181|title=Mid-ocean ridges|last=Searle,|first=Roger|publisher=Cambridge|year=2013|isbn=9781107017528|location=New York|pages=|oclc=842323181}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of various mountains linked in chains, typically having a [[valley]] known as a [[rift]] running along its spine. This type of oceanic [[mountain ridge]] is characteristic of what is known as an 'oceanic spreading center', which is responsible for [[seafloor spreading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1029/GM106|title=Faulting and Magmatism at Mid‐Ocean Ridges {{!}} Geophysical Monograph Series|doi=10.1029/gm106|bibcode=1998GMS...106.....R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of new [[seafloor]] results from [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] [[upwelling]] in response to plate spreading; this [[isentropic]] upwelling solid mantle material eventually exceeds the [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] and melts. The buoyant melt rises as [[magma]] at a linear weakness in the [[oceanic crust]], and emerges as [[lava]], creating new crust upon cooling. A mid-ocean [[ridge]] demarcates the boundary between two tectonic plates, and consequently is termed a [[divergent boundary|divergent plate boundary]].

==Description==
[[File:Mid-ocean ridge topography.gif|thumb|500px|A mid-ocean ridge, with magma rising from a chamber below, forming new ocean plate that spreads away from the ridge]]
[[File:Þingvellir National Park, Bláskógabyggð (6969755432).jpg|thumb|upright|Mid-ocean ridge in [[Þingvellir National Park]], Iceland]]

=== Volcanism ===
Mid-ocean ridges are geologically active, with continuing [[volcanism]] and [[seismicity]]. New magma steadily emerges onto the ocean floor and intrudes into the ocean crust at and near rifts along the ridge axes. The crystallized magma forms new crust of [[basalt]] (known as '''MORB''' for mid-ocean ridge basalt) and below it (in the [[lower oceanic crust]]), [[gabbro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Peter|last2=Cheadle|first2=Michael|date=February 20, 2009|title=Making a Crust|url=|journal=Science|volume=323|pages=1017–18|doi=10.1126/science.1169556}}&lt;/ref&gt; MORs are formed by two oceanic plates moving away from each other. [[Hydrothermal vent]]s are a common feature at oceanic spreading centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=William|last2=Baross|first2=John|last3=Kelley|first3=Deborah|last4=Russell|first4=Michael J.|date=2008-11-01|title=Hydrothermal vents and the origin of life|url=http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v6/n11/abs/nrmicro1991.html|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|volume=6|issue=11|pages=805–814|doi=10.1038/nrmicro1991|issn=1740-1526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mid-ocean ridge basalt is a [[tholeiitic basalt]] and is characteristically low in [[incompatible element]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hyndman, Donald W. | title=Petrology of igneous and metamorphic rocks |edition=2nd|year=1985|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-031658-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Blatt, Harvey | author2=Robert Tracy | last-author-amp=yes | title=Petrology | edition=2nd | year=1996|publisher=Freeman|isbn=978-0-7167-2438-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rocks making up the crust below the seafloor are youngest along the axis of the ridge and age with increasing distance from that axis. New magma of basalt composition emerges at and near the axis because of [[Igneous rock#Decompression|decompression melting]] in the underlying [[Earth's mantle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-412-53310-5|author=[[Marjorie Wilson]]|year=1993|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|location=London|title=Igneous petrogenesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[oceanic crust]] is made up of rocks much younger than the Earth itself. Most oceanic crust in the ocean basins is less than 200 million years old. The crust is in a constant state of "renewal" at the ocean ridges. Moving away from the mid-ocean ridge, ocean depth progressively increases; the greatest depths are in [[ocean trench]]es. As the [[oceanic crust]] moves away from the ridge axis, the [[peridotite]] in the underlying mantle cools and becomes more rigid. The crust and the relatively rigid peridotite below it make up the oceanic [[lithosphere]].

=== Morphology ===
{{See also|Seafloor spreading#Sea floor global topography: half-space model}}
The bathymetry, or profile of a MOR is largely determined by the seafloor spreading rate at the ridge.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Slow spreading ridges (&lt; 5&amp;nbsp;cm/yr) like the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] (MAR) generally have large, wide [[rift valley]]s, sometimes as wide as {{convert|10|-|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and very rugged terrain at the ridge crest that can have relief of up to a {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. By contrast, fast spreading ridges (&gt;8&amp;nbsp;cm/yr) like the [[East Pacific Rise]] (EPR) are narrow, sharp incisions surrounded by generally flat [[topography]] that slopes away from the ridge over many hundreds of miles.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macdonald|first=K. C.|date=1982|title=Mid-Ocean Ridges: Fine Scale Tectonic, Volcanic and Hydrothermal Processes Within the Plate Boundary Zone|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ea.10.050182.001103|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|volume=10|issue=1|pages=155–190|doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.10.050182.001103|bibcode=1982AREPS..10..155M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultra-slow spreading ridges (&lt; 2&amp;nbsp;cm/yr), like the Southwest India and the Arctic Ridges form both magmatic and amagmatic ridge segments without transform faults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dick|first=Henry J.

The [[Seafloor spreading#Spreading center|spreading center]] or axis, commonly connects to a [[transform fault]] oriented at right angles to the axis. The flanks of mid-ocean ridges are in many places marked by the inactive scars of transform faults called [[fracture zone]]s. At faster spreading rates the axes often display [[Overlapping spreading centers|Overlapping Spreading Centers]] that lack connecting transform faults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macdonald|first=Ken C.|last2=Fox|first2=P. J.|date=1983|title=Overlapping spreading centres: new accretion geometry on the East Pacific Rise|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/302055a0|journal=Nature|volume=302|issue=5903|pages=55–58|doi=10.1038/302055a0|issn=1476-4687|via=|bibcode=1983Natur.302...55M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depth of the seafloor (or the height of a location on a mid-ocean ridge above a baselevel) is closely correlated with its age (age of the [[lithosphere]] where depth is measured). The age-depth relation can be modeled by the cooling of a lithosphere plate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sclater|first=John G.|last2=Anderson|first2=Roger N.|last3=Bell|first3=M.

The overall shape of ridges results from [[Wallace Pratt|Pratt]] [[isostacy]]: close to the ridge axis there is hot, low-density mantle supporting the oceanic crust. As the oceanic plates cool, away from the ridge axes, the oceanic mantle lithosphere (the colder, denser part of the mantle that, together with the crust, comprises the oceanic plates) thickens and the density increases. Thus older seafloor is underlain by denser material and is deeper. The width of the ridge is hence a function of spreading rate – slow ridges like the MAR have spread much less far (showing a narrower profile) than faster ridges like the EPR (wider profile) for the same amount of cooling and consequent bathymetric deepening.

==Formation processes==
{{Further|Plate tectonics}}
[[File:oceanic spreading.svg|thumb|right|300px|Oceanic crust is formed at an oceanic ridge, while the lithosphere is subducted back into the asthenosphere at trenches.]]

Two processes, [[ridge-push]] and [[slab pull]], are thought to be responsible for the spreading seen at mid-ocean ridges, and there is some uncertainty as to which is dominant. Ridge-push occurs when the growing bulk of the ridge pushes the rest of the tectonic plate away from the ridge, often towards a [[subduction zone]]. At the subduction zone, "slab-pull" comes into effect. This is simply the weight of the tectonic plate being subducted (pulled) below the overlying plate dragging the rest of the plate along behind it.  The slab pull mechanism is considered to be contributing more than the ridge push.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harff|first1=Jan|last2=Meschede|first2=Martin|last3=Petersen|first3=Sven|last4=Thiede|first4=Jörn|title=Driving Forces: Slab Pull, Ridge Push|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-6644-0_105-1|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-94-007-6644-0|pages=1–6|edition=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other process proposed to contribute to the formation of new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges is the "mantle conveyor" (see image). However, there have been some studies which have shown that the upper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] ([[asthenosphere]]) is too plastic (flexible) to generate enough [[friction]] to pull the tectonic plate along. Moreover, unlike in the image above, mantle upwelling that causes magma to form beneath the ocean ridges appears to involve only its upper {{convert|400|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}}, as deduced from [[seismic tomography]] and from studies of the seismic discontinuity at about {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The relatively shallow depths from which the upwelling mantle rises below ridges are more consistent with the "slab-pull" process. On the other hand, some of the world's largest tectonic plates such as the [[North American Plate]] are in motion, yet are nowhere being subducted.

The rate at which the mid-ocean ridge creates new material is known as the spreading rate, and is typically measured in mm/yr. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 90&amp;nbsp;mm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 50–90&amp;nbsp;mm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 50&amp;nbsp;mm/year.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/842323181|title=Mid-ocean ridges|last=Searle|first=Roger|publisher=Cambridge|year=2013|isbn=9781107017528|location=New York|pages=2|oclc=842323181}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} The spreading rate of the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] is ~ 25&amp;nbsp;mm/yr, while in the [[Pacific]] region, it is 80–120&amp;nbsp;mm/yr. Ridges that spread at rates &lt;20&amp;nbsp;mm/yr are referred to as ultraslow spreading ridges&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{rp|2}} (e.g., the [[Gakkel Ridge]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]] and the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]]) and they provide a much different perspective on crustal formation than their faster spreading brethren.

The mid-ocean ridge systems form new oceanic crust. As crystallized basalt extruded at a ridge axis cools below [[Curie point]]s of appropriate iron-titanium oxides, magnetic field directions parallel to the Earth's magnetic field are recorded in those oxides. The orientations of the field in the oceanic crust preserve a record of directions of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] with time. Because the field has reversed directions at irregular intervals throughout its history, the pattern of [[geomagnetic reversals]] in the ocean crust can be used as an indicator of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puetz|first=Stephen|last2=Condie|first2=Kent|displayauthors=1|date=January 2017|title=Quantifying the evolution of the continental and oceanic crust|url=|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=164|pages=63–83|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2016.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the pattern of reversals together with age measurements of the crust is used to help establish the history of the Earth's magnetic field.

[[File:World Distribution of Mid-Oceanic Ridges.gif|right|300px|thumb|World distribution of mid-oceanic ridges; [[USGS]]]]
The mid-ocean ridges of the world are connected and form ''the'' Ocean Ridge, a single global mid-oceanic ridge system that is part of every [[ocean]], making it the [[List of mountain ranges#By length|longest]] [[mountain range]] in the world. The continuous mountain range is {{convert|65000|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}} long (several times longer than the [[Andes]], the longest continental mountain range), and the total length of the oceanic ridge system is {{convert|80000|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the longest mountain range on earth?|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/midoceanridge.html|website=Ocean Facts|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased rates of [[Seafloor spreading|sea-floor spreading]] (i.e. the expansion of the mid-ocean ridge) has caused global (eustatic) sea-level to rise over very long timescales (millions of years).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B012227430X002683|title=Sea Level Change|last=Church|first=J.A.|last2=Gregory|first2=J.M.|pages=2599–2604|doi=10.1006/rwos.2001.0268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high sea levels that occurred during the [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous period]] (144–65 Ma) can only be attributed to [[plate tectonics]] since thermal expansion and the absence of ice sheets by themselves cannot account for the fact that sea levels were 100–170 meters higher than today.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4020-4411-3_206|title=Encyclopedia of Paleoclimatology and Ancient Environments|last=Miller|first=Kenneth G.|date=2009|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|pages=879–887|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4411-3_206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased sea-floor spreading means that the hot young crust at the mid-ocean ridge will form at a faster rate than it can be destroyed at subduction zones. The mid-ocean ridge will then expand and form a broader ridge, taking up more space in the [[Oceanic basin|ocean basin]] and causing sea levels to rise.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Sea level rise|Sea-level change]] can be attributed to other factors ([[thermal expansion]], ice melting). Over very long timescales, however, it is the result of changes in the volume of the ocean basins which are, in turn, affected by rates of sea-floor spreading along the mid-ocean ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B012227430X002555|title=Sea Level Variations Over Geologic Time|last=Kominz|first=M.A.|pages=2605–2613|doi=10.1006/rwos.2001.0255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seawater Chemistry  ==
[[File:MgCaRatioChanges.jpg|thumb|Magnesium/calcium ratio changes at mid-ocean ridges]]
Mid-ocean ridges are global scale ion-exchange systems.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardie|first=Lawrence|last2=Stanley|first2=Steven|date=February 1999|title=Hypercalcification: Paleontology Links Plate Tectonics and Geochemistry to Sedimentology|url=https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/9/2/pdf/i1052-5173-9-2-1.pdf|journal=GSA Today|volume=9|issue=2|pages=1–7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapid spreading rates will expand the mid-ocean ridge causing basalt reactions with seawater to happen faster. The magnesium/calcium ratio will be lower because more magnesium ions are being removed from seawater and consumed by the rock, and more calcium ions are being removed from the rock and released to seawater. A lower Mg/Ca ratio favors the precipitation of low-Mg calcite polymorphs of [[calcium carbonate]] ([[calcite sea]]s).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Slow spreading at mid-ocean ridges has the opposite effect and will result in a higher Mg/Ca ratio favoring the precipitation of aragonite and high-Mg calcite polymorphs of calcium carbonate ([[aragonite sea]]s).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Experiments show that most modern high-Mg calcite organisms would have been low-Mg calcite in past calcite seas,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ries|first=Justin B.|date=2004-11-01|title=Effect of ambient Mg/Ca ratio on Mg fractionation in calcareous marine invertebrates: A record of the oceanic Mg/Ca ratio over the Phanerozoic|url=https://doi.org/10.1130/G20851.1|journal=Geology|volume=32|issue=11|doi=10.1130/g20851.1|issn=0091-7613|bibcode=2004Geo....32..981R}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that the Mg/Ca ratio in an organism's skeleton varies with the Mg/Ca ratio of the seawater in which it was grown.

The mineralogy of reef-building and sediment-producing organisms is thus regulated by chemical reactions occurring along the mid-ocean ridge, the rate of which is controlled by sea-floor spreading.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==History==

===Discovery===
{{Main|Plate tectonics#Historical context}}

Mid-ocean ridges are generally submerged deep in the ocean. It was not until the 1950s, when the ocean floor was surveyed in detail, that their full extent became known.

The ''[[Research Vessel Vema|Vema]]'', a ship of the [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] of [[Columbia University]], traversed the [[Atlantic Ocean]], recording data about the ocean floor from the ocean surface. A team led by [[Marie Tharp]] and [[Bruce C. Heezen|Bruce Heezen]] analyzed the data and concluded that there was an enormous mountain chain running up the middle. Scientists named it the "[[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]".

At first, the ridge was thought to be a phenomenon specific to the Atlantic Ocean. However, as surveys of the ocean floor continued around the world, it was discovered that every ocean contains parts of the mid-ocean ridge system. Although the ridge system runs down the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, the ridge is located away from the center of other oceans.

===Impact===
[[Alfred Wegener]] proposed the theory of [[continental drift]] in 1912. He stated: "the Mid-Atlantic Ridge ... zone in which the floor of the Atlantic, as it keeps spreading, is continuously tearing open and making space for fresh, relatively fluid and hot [[Sima (geology)|sima]] [rising] from depth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1981)9&lt;25:MCOEDA&gt;2.0.CO;2|last=Jacoby |first=W. R. |title=Modern concepts of earth dynamics anticipated by Alfred Wegener in 1912 |journal=Geology |volume=9 |pages=25–27 |date=January 1981 |bibcode=1981Geo.....9...25J}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wegener did not pursue this observation in his later works and his theory was dismissed by geologists because there was no mechanism to explain how [[continent]]s could plow through ocean [[crust (geology)|crust]], and the theory became largely forgotten.

Following the discovery of the worldwide extent of the mid-ocean ridge in the 1950s, geologists faced a new task: explaining how such an enormous geological structure could have formed. In the 1960s, geologists discovered and began to propose mechanisms for [[seafloor spreading]]. The discovery of mid-ocean ridges and the process of [[seafloor spreading]] allowed for [[Alfred Wegener|Wegner's]] theory to be expanded so that it included the movement of oceanic crust as well as the continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/seafloor-spreading/|title=seafloor spreading|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2015-06-08|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plate tectonics]] was a suitable explanation for seafloor spreading, and the acceptance of plate tectonics by the majority of geologists resulted in a major [[paradigm shift]] in geological thinking.

It is estimated that 20 [[volcanic]] eruptions occur each year along earth's mid-ocean ridges and that every year {{convert|2.5|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of new seafloor is formed by this process. With a crustal thickness of {{convert|1|to|2|km|mi|abbr=on}}, this amounts to about {{convert|4|km3|mi3|abbr=on}} of new ocean crust formed every year.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

'''Natural dyes''' are [[dyes]] or colorants derived from [[plant]]s, [[invertebrate]]s, or [[mineral]]s.  The majority of natural dyes are '''vegetable dyes''' from plant sources—[[root]]s, [[berry|berries]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[leaf|leaves]], and [[wood]]—and other biological sources such as [[fungi]] and [[lichen]]s.

[[Archeology|Archaeologists]] have found evidence of [[textile]] [[dyeing]] dating back to the [[Neolithic]] period. In India, dyeing with plants, barks and insects has been traced back more than 5,000 years.&lt;ref name="Goodwin11"&gt;Goodwin (1982), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The essential process of dyeing changed little over time.  Typically, the dye material is put in a pot of water and then the textiles to be dyed are added to the pot, which is heated and stirred until the color is transferred.  Textile [[fibre]] may be dyed before [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] ("dyed in the wool"), but most textiles are "[[yarn]]-dyed" or "piece-dyed" after [[weaving]]. Many natural dyes require the use of chemicals called [[mordant]]s to bind the dye to the textile fibres; [[tannin]] from [[gallnut|oak galls]], salt, natural [[alum]], [[vinegar]], and [[ammonia]] from stale [[urine]] were used by early dyers.  Many mordants, and some dyes themselves, produce strong odors, and large-scale dyeworks were often isolated in their own districts.

Throughout history, people have dyed their textiles using common, locally available materials, but scarce dyestuffs that produced brilliant and permanent colors such as the natural invertebrate dyes, [[Tyrian purple]] and crimson [[kermes (dye)|kermes]], became highly prized luxury items in the ancient and medieval world. Plant-based dyes such as [[isatis tinctoria|woad]] (''[[Isatis tinctoria]]''), [[Indigo dye|indigo]], [[Saffron (use)|saffron]], and [[Rose madder|madder]] were raised commercially and were important trade goods in the economies of Asia and Europe. Across Asia and Africa, patterned fabrics were produced using [[resist dyeing]] techniques to control the absorption of color in piece-dyed cloth.  Dyes such as [[cochineal]] and [[Haematoxylum campechianum|logwood]] (''[[Haematoxylum campechianum]]'') were brought to Europe by the [[Spain|Spanish]] treasure fleets, and the dyestuffs of Europe were carried by colonists to America.

The discovery of man-made [[dye|synthetic dye]]s in the mid-19th century triggered a long decline in the large-scale market for natural dyes.  Synthetic dyes, which could be produced in large quantities, quickly superseded natural dyes for the commercial textile production enabled by the [[industrial revolution]], and unlike natural dyes, were suitable for the synthetic fibres that followed.  Artists of the ''[[Arts and Crafts Movement]]'' preferred the pure shades and subtle variability of natural dyes, which mellow with age but preserve their true colors, unlike early synthetic dyes,&lt;ref name="Goodwin11" /&gt; and helped ensure that the old European techniques for dyeing and printing with natural dyestuffs were preserved for use by home and [[craft]] dyers.  Natural dyeing techniques are also preserved by artisans in traditional cultures around the world.

In the early 21st century, the market for natural dyes in the fashion industry is experiencing a resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calderin|first=Jay|title=Form, Fit, Fashion|year=2009|publisher=Rockport|isbn=978-1-59253-541-5|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western consumers have become more concerned about the health and environmental impact of synthetic dyes in manufacturing and there is a growing demand for products that use natural dyes. The European Union, for example, has encouraged Indonesian batik cloth producers to switch to natural dyes to improve their export market in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Faizal|first=Elly Burhaini|title=Indonesia told to produce more 'green' products|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/10/29/indonesia-told-produce-more-green-products.html|accessdate=November 9, 2011|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|date=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fibre content determines the type of dye required for a fabric:
* [[Cellulose]] fibres: cotton, linen, hemp, ramie, bamboo, rayon
* [[Protein]] fibres: wool, angora, mohair, cashmere, silk, soy, leather, suede
Cellulose fibres require fibre-reactive, direct/substantive, and vat dyes, which are colourless, soluble dyes fixed by light and/or oxygen. Protein fibres require vat, acid, or indirect/mordant dyes, that require a bonding agent. Each synthetic fibre requires its own dyeing method, for example, nylon requires acid, disperse and pigment dyes, rayon acetate requires disperse dyes, and so on. The types of natural dyes currently in use by the global fashion industry include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calderin|first=Jay|title=Form, Fit, Fashion|year=2009|publisher=Rockport|isbn=978-1-59253-541-5|pages=125–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Colors in the "ruddy" range of reds, browns, and oranges are the first attested colors in a number of ancient textile sites ranging from the [[Neolithic]] to the [[Bronze Age]] across the [[Levant]], [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Europe]], followed by evidence of blues and then yellows, with green appearing somewhat later.  The earliest surviving evidence of textile dyeing was found at the large [[Neolithic]] settlement at [[Çatalhöyük]] in southern [[Anatolia]], where traces of red dyes, possible from [[ochre]] ([[iron oxide]] [[pigment]]s from [[clay]]), were found.&lt;ref name="Barber223"&gt;Barber (1991), pp. 223–25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Polychrome or multicolored fabrics seem to have been developed in the 3rd or 2nd millennium BCE.&lt;ref name="Barber223"/&gt;  Textiles with a "red-brown [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and an ochre-yellow [[weft]]" were discovered in Egyptian pyramids of the Sixth Dynasty (2345–2180 BCE).&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;Rogers, Penelope Walton, "Dyes and Dyeing". In Jenkins (2003), pp. 25–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical analysis that would definitively identify the dyes used in ancient textiles has rarely been conducted, and even when a dye such as indigo blue is detected it is impossible to determine which of several indigo-bearing plants was used.&lt;ref&gt;Barber (1991), pp. 227, 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, based on the colors of surviving textile fragments and the evidence of actual dyestuffs found in archaeological sites, reds, blues, and yellows from plant sources were in common use by the late Bronze Age and [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name="Barber228"/&gt;

In the 18th century [[Jeremias Friedrich Gülich]] made substantial contributions to refining the dyeing process,&lt;ref name="goethe"&gt;[https://theoryofcolor.org/tiki-index.php?page_ref_id=13#Relation_to_the_Technical_Operations_of_the_Dyer Goethe's Theory of Colours: Relation to the Technical Operations of the Dyer]&lt;/ref&gt; making particular progress on setting standards on dyeing sheep wool and many other textiles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theoryofcolor.org/Achtzehntes+Jahrhundert+Zweite+Epoche?highlight=Jeremias#Jeremias_Friedrich_G_lich Goethe's Theory of Colours, Historical Section on Jeremias]&lt;/ref&gt; His contributions to refining the dying process and his theories on colour brought much praise by the well known poet and artist [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref name="goethe" /&gt;

==Processes==
{{details|Glossary of dyeing terms}}
[[File:Dyeing British Library Royal MS 15.E.iii, f. 269 1482.jpg|right|thumb|Dyeing wool cloth, 1482, from British Library Royal MS 15.E.iii, f. 269.]]
The essential process of dyeing requires soaking the material containing the dye (the ''dyestuff'') in water, adding the textile to be dyed to the resulting solution (the ''dyebath''), and bringing the solution to a [[Simmering|simmer]] for an extended period, often measured in days or even weeks, stirring occasionally until the color has evenly transferred to the textiles.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1982), pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dyestuffs, such as [[indigo dye|indigo]] and [[lichen]]s, will give good color when used alone; these dyes are called ''direct dyes'' or ''[[substantive dye]]s''. The majority of plant dyes, however, also require the use of a [[mordant]], a [[chemical]] used to "fix" the color in the textile [[fibre]]s.  These dyes are called ''adjective dyes''.  By using different mordants, dyers can often obtain a variety of colors and shades from the same dye. Fibres or cloth may be pretreated with mordants, or the mordant may be incorporated in the dyebath.  In traditional dyeing, the common mordants are [[vinegar]], [[tannin]] from [[oak]] bark, [[sumac]] or [[gallnut|oak gall]]s, [[ammonia]] from stale urine, and wood-ash liquor or [[potash]] ([[potassium carbonate]]) made by [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaching]] wood ashes and evaporating the solution.&lt;ref name="Goodwin12"&gt;Goodwin (1982), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1982), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerridge (1988), pp. 165–66&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|We shall never know by what chances primitive man discovered that salt, [[vinegar]] from [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermenting]] fruit, natural [[alum]], and stale [[urine]] helped to fix and enhance the colours of his yarns, but for many centuries these four substances were used as mordants.&lt;ref name="Goodwin12" /&gt;}}

Salt helps to "fix" or increase "fastness" of colors, vinegar improves reds and purples, and the [[ammonia]] in stale urine assists in the fermentation of indigo dyes.&lt;ref name="Goodwin12" /&gt;
Natural alum (aluminum sulfate) is the most common metallic salt mordant, but tin ([[Tin(II) chloride|stannous chloride]]), copper ([[Copper(II) sulfate|cupric sulfate]]), iron ([[Iron(II) sulfate|ferrous sulfate]], called ''copperas'') and chrome ([[potassium dichromate]]) are also used.  Iron mordants "sadden" colors, while tin and chrome mordants brighten colors.  The iron mordants contribute to fabric deterioration, referred to as "dye rot". Additional chemicals or ''alterants'' may be applied after dying to further alter or reinforce the colors.&lt;ref name="Barber235"&gt;Barber (1991), pp. 235–36, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1982), pp. 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quilthistory.com/cleaning.htm |title=informational site about antique quilts and vintage textiles including article and an interactive chat group |publisher=Quilt History |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Natural dye.jpg|left|thumb|A dye-works with baskets of dyestuffs, skeins of dyed yarn, and heated vats for dyeing.]]
[[File:Pomegranate as a natural dye.jpg|thumb|Using natural dyes to color the yarn of Tasar silk.]]

Textiles may be dyed as raw [[fibre]] (''dyed in the fleece'' or ''dyed in the wool''), as [[spinning (textiles)|spun]] [[yarn]] (''dyed in the hank'' or ''yarn-dyed''), or after [[weaving]] (''piece-dyed'').&lt;ref&gt;Kerridge (1988), pp. 15, 16, 135&lt;/ref&gt;  Mordants often leave residue in wool fibre that makes it difficult to spin, so wool was generally dyed after spinning, as yarn or woven cloth. Indigo, however, requires no mordant, and cloth manufacturers in [[medieval England]] often dyed wool in the fleece with the indigo-bearing plant [[isatis tinctoria|woad]] and then dyed the cloth again after weaving to produce deep blues, browns, reds, purples, blacks, and tawnies.&lt;ref&gt;Munro (2003), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerridge (1988), pp. 15, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, Japan, India, [[Pakistan]], [[Nigeria]], [[Gambia]], and other parts of [[West Africa]] and [[southeast Asia]], patterned silk and cotton fabrics were produced using [[resist dyeing]] techniques in which the cloth is [[woodblock printing on textiles|printed]] or [[stencil]]ed with [[starch]] or [[wax]], or tied in various ways to prevent even penetration of the dye when the cloth is piece-dyed. The Chinese ''ladao'' process is dated to the 10th century; other traditional techniques include [[tie-dye]], [[batik]], [[Rōketsuzome]], [[katazome]], [[bandhani]] and [[leheria]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillow &amp; Sentence (1999), pp. 122–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The mordants used in dyeing and many dyestuffs themselves give off strong and unpleasant odors, and the actual process of dyeing requires a good supply of fresh water, storage areas for bulky plant materials, vats which can be kept heated (often for days or weeks) along with the necessary fuel, and airy spaces to dry the dyed textiles.  Ancient large-scale dye-works tended to be located on the outskirts of populated areas, on windy promontories.&lt;ref name="Barber239"&gt;Barber (1991), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reds and pinks===
A variety of plants produce red dyes, including avocado pits,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allnaturaldyeing.com/dyeing-with-avocados/|title=Dyeing with avocados|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a number of [[lichen]]s, [[henna]], alkanet or dyer's bugloss (''[[Alkanna tinctoria]]''), [[asafoetida]] and dyer's madder ''[[Rubia tinctorum]]''.&lt;ref name="Barber232"&gt;Barber (1991), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Madder and related plants of the genus  ''[[Rubia]]'' are native to many [[temperate zone]]s around the world, and were already used as sources of good red dye, such as [[rose madder]], in prehistory.  Madder has been identified on [[linen]] in the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]],&lt;ref name="Barber232"/&gt; and [[Pliny the Elder]] records madder growing near Rome.&lt;ref name="Goodwin64"&gt;Goodwin (1982), pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Madder was a dye of commercial importance in Europe, being cultivated in the Netherlands and France to dye the [[Red coat (British army)|red coats]] of military uniforms until the market collapsed following the development of synthetic [[alizarin]] dye in 1869.  Madder was also used to dye the "hunting pinks" of Great Britain.&lt;ref name="Goodwin64" /&gt;

Turkey red was a strong, very fast red dye for cotton obtained from madder root via a complicated multistep process involving "[[sumac]] and oak galls, calf's blood, sheep's dung, oil, soda, alum, and a solution of tin".&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1982), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  Turkey red was developed in India and spread to Turkey.  Greek workers familiar with the methods of its production were brought to France in 1747, and Dutch and English spies soon discovered the secret.  A sanitized version of Turkey red was being produced in Manchester by 1784, and roller-printed dress cottons with a Turkey red ground were fashionable in England by the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;Tozer &amp; Levitt (1983), pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cannon &amp; Cannon (2002), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Munjeet or Indian madder (''[[Rubia cordifolia]]'') is native to the [[Himalaya Mountains|Himalayas]] and other mountains of Asia and Japan.  Munjeet was an important dye for the Asian cotton industry and is still used by craft dyers in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon &amp; Cannon (2002), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puccoon or bloodroot (''[[Sanguinaria canadensis]]'') is a popular red dye among Southeastern Native American basketweavers.&lt;ref name=hand37&gt;Chancey, 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Choctaw]] basketweavers additionally use [[sumac]] for red dye.&lt;ref name=hand51&gt;Chancey 51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coushatta]]s artists from Texas and Louisiana used the [[water oak]] (''[[Quercus nigra]]'' L.) to produce red.&lt;ref&gt;Chancey 66&lt;/ref&gt;

A delicate rose color in [[Navajo rug]]s comes from fermented [[prickly pear cactus]] fruit, ''[[Opuntia polyacantha]]''.&lt;ref name=by5&gt;Bryan and Young 5&lt;/ref&gt; Navajo weavers also use rainwater and red dirt to create salmon-pink dyes.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan and Young 62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oranges===
Dyes that create reds and yellows can also yield oranges. Navajo dyers create orange dyes from  one-seeded juniper, ''[[Juniperus monosperma]]'', [[Navajo tea]], ''[[Thelesperma gracile]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Bryan and Young 6&lt;/ref&gt; or [[alder]] bark.&lt;ref name=chart&gt;[http://www.bairsindiantradingco.com/craft_items/74-DC-12.htm "12 Plant Navajo Dye Chart, Craftperson: Maggie Begay."] ''Bair's Indian Trading Company.'' (retrieved 9 Jan 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yellows===
Yellow dyes are "about as numerous as red ones",&lt;ref name="Barber233"&gt;Barber (1991), p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; and can be extracted from [[saffron]], [[pomegranate]] rind, [[turmeric]], [[safflower]], [[onion]]skins, and a number of weedy flowering plants.&lt;ref name="Barber233" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodwin60"&gt;Goodwin (1982), pp. 60–63&lt;/ref&gt;  Limited evidence suggests the use of weld (''[[Reseda (plant)|Reseda luteola]]''), also called mignonette or dyer's rocket&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alchemy-works.com/reseda_luteola.html ''Reseda luteola'']&lt;/ref&gt; before the Iron Age,&lt;ref name="Barber233" /&gt; but it was an important dye of the ancient Mediterranean and Europe and is indigenous to England.&lt;ref name="Goodwin63"&gt;Goodwin (1982), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Two brilliant yellow dyes of commercial importance in Europe from the 18th century are derived from trees of the [[Americas]]: [[quercitron]] from the inner bark of [[Eastern Black Oak]] (''Quercus velutina''), native to eastern North America and [[Maclura tinctoria|fustic]] from the dyer's mulberry tree (''[[Maclura tinctoria]]'') of the [[West Indies]] and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Goodwin60" /&gt;

In [[rivercane]] basketweaving among [[Southeastern Woodlands tribes]] in the Americas, butternut (''[[Juglans cinerea]]'') and yellow root (''[[Xanthorhiza simplicissima]]'') provide a rich yellow color.&lt;ref name=hand37/&gt; [[Chitimacha]] basket weavers have a complex formula for yellow that employs a dock plant (most likely ''[[Rumex crispus]]'') for yellow.&lt;ref&gt;Chancey 47&lt;/ref&gt; Navajo artists create yellow dyes from [[Gutierrezia|small snake-weed]], brown onion skins, and [[Parthenium incanum|rubber plant]] (''[[Parthenium incanum]]''). [[Chrysothamnus|Rabbitbush]] (''[[Chrysothamnus]]'') and [[rose hip]]s produce pale, yellow-cream colored dyes.&lt;ref name=chart/&gt;

===Greens===
If plants that yield yellow dyes are common, plants that yield green dyes are rare.  Both woad and indigo have been used since ancient times in combination with yellow dyes to produce shades of green.  [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Early Modern period|Early Modern]] England was especially known for its green dyes.  The dyers of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], a great cloth town in the [[high Middle Ages]], produced the [[Lincoln green]] cloth associated with [[Robin Hood]] by dyeing wool with woad and then overdyeing it yellow with weld or dyer's greenweed (''[[Genista tinctoria]]''), also known as dyer's broom.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon &amp; Cannon (2002), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  Woolen cloth mordanted with alum and dyed yellow with dyer's greenweed was overdyed with woad and, later, indigo, to produce the once-famous Kendal green.&lt;ref name="Goodwin63" /&gt; This in turn fell out of fashion in the 18th century in favor of the brighter Saxon green, dyed with indigo and fustic.

Soft olive greens are also achieved when textiles dyed yellow are treated with an iron mordant. The dull green cloth common to the Iron Age [[Halstatt]] culture shows traces of iron, and was possibly colored by boiling yellow-dyed cloth in an iron pot.&lt;ref&gt;Barber (1991), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau]] in North America used lichen to dye corn husk bags a sea green.&lt;ref name=hand173&gt;Chancey 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Navajo textile artist Nonabah Gorman Bryan developed a two-step process for creating green dye. First the [[Churro wool]] yarn is dyed yellow with [[sagebrush]], ''[[Artemisia tridentata]]'', and then it is soaked in black dye afterbath.&lt;ref name=by5/&gt; Red onion skins are also used by Navajo dyers to produce green.&lt;ref name=chart/&gt;

===Blues===
Blue colorants around the world were derived from [[indigo dye]]-bearing plants, primarily those in the genus ''[[Indigofera]]'', which are native to the [[tropics]].  The primary commercial [[indigo]] species in Asia was true indigo (''[[Indigofera tinctoria]]''). [[India]] is believed to be the oldest center of indigo dyeing in the Old World. It was a primary supplier of indigo dye to Europe as early as the Greco-Roman era. The association of India with indigo is reflected in the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for the dye, which was ''indikon'' (ινδικόν). The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used the term ''indicum'', which passed into Italian dialect and eventually into English as the word ''indigo''.&lt;ref name="Indigo"&gt;See [[Indigo dye]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], the important blue dyes were Añil (''[[Indigofera suffruticosa]]'') and Natal indigo (''Indigofera arrecta'').&lt;ref name="Indigo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1982), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

In temperate climates including Europe, indigo was obtained primarily from woad (''[[Isatis tinctoria]]''), an indigenous plant of [[Assyria]] and the [[Levant]] which has been grown in Northern Europe over 2,000 years, although from the 18th century it was mostly replaced by superior Indian indigo imported by the [[British East India Company]].  Woad was carried to [[New England]] in the 17th century and used extensively in America until native stands of indigo were discovered in Florida and the Carolinas. In [[Sumatra]], indigo dye is extracted from some species of ''[[Marsdenia]]''.  Other indigo-bearing dye plants include dyer's knotweed (''[[Polygonum tinctorum]]'') from Japan and the coasts of China, and the West African shrub ''Lonchocarpus cyanescens''.&lt;ref name="Indigo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodwin70"&gt;Goodwin (1982), pp. 11, 70–76&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Purples===
In [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe, purple, violet, [[murrey]] and similar colors were produced by dyeing wool with woad or indigo in the fleece and then piece-dyeing the woven cloth with red dyes, either the common madder or the luxury dyes [[kermes (dye)|kermes]] and [[cochineal]].  Madder could also produce purples when used with alum.  [[Brazilwood]] also gave purple shades with vitriol ([[sulfuric acid]]) or potash.&lt;ref&gt;Kerridge (1988), pp. 166–67&lt;/ref&gt;

Choctaw artists traditionally used maple (''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'' sp.) to create lavender and purple dyes.&lt;ref name=hand51/&gt;  Purples can also be derived from [[lichen]]s, and from the berries of [[White Bryony]] from the northern [[Rocky Mountain]] states and mulberry (''[[morus nigra]]'') (with an acid mordant).&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1982), pp. 107, 112&lt;/ref&gt;

===Browns===
[[Catechu|Cutch]] is an ancient brown dye from the wood of acacia trees, particularly ''[[Acacia catechu]]'', used in India for dyeing [[cotton]]. Cutch gives gray-browns with an iron mordant and olive-browns with copper.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1982), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Black walnut]] (''[[Juglans nigra]]'') is used by Cherokee artists to produce a deep brown approaching black.&lt;ref name=hand37/&gt; Today black walnut is primarily used to dye baskets but has been used in the past for fabrics and deerhide. Juniper, ''[[Juniperus monosperma]]'', ashes provide brown and yellow dyes for [[Navajo people]],&lt;ref name=by5&gt;Bryan and Young 5&lt;/ref&gt; as do the hulls of [[wild walnut]]s (''[[Juglans major]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Bryan and Young 61&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Khaki]], which translates a Hindustani word signifying "soil-coloured", was introduced into British uniforms in India, which were dyed locally with a dye prepared from the native [[Nannorrhops|mazari palm ''Nannorrhops'']].

===Greys and blacks===
Choctaw dyers use maple (''Acer'' sp.) for a grey dye.&lt;ref name=hand51/&gt; [[Navajo weaving|Navajo weavers]] create black from mineral yellow [[ochre]] mixed with pitch from the [[piñon tree]](''[[Pinus edulis]]'') and the [[three-leaved sumac]] (''[[Rhus trilobata]]'').&lt;ref name=by5/&gt; They also produce a cool grey dye with blue flower [[lupin]]e and a warm grey from [[Juniper mistletoe]] (''[[Phoradendron juniperinum]]'').&lt;ref name=chart/&gt;

===Lichen===
Dye-bearing [[lichen]] produce a wide range of greens,&lt;ref name=hand173/&gt; oranges, yellows, reds, browns, and bright pinks and purples. The lichen ''Rocella tinctoria'' was found along the Mediterranean Sea and was used by the ancient [[Phoenicia]]ns.  In recent times, lichen dyes have been an important part of the dye traditions of [[Wales]], [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and among native peoples of the southwest and [[Intermontane Plateaus]] of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=hand173/&gt;  [[Traditional dyes of the Scottish Highlands|Scottish lichen dyes]] include [[cudbear]] (also called [[Orcein|archil]] in England and [[litmus]] in the Netherlands), and crottle.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1982), pp. 87–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungi===
The American artist [[Miriam C. Rice]] pioneered research into using various mushrooms for natural dyes. Starting in the late 1960s, she discovered [[mushroom dye]]s for a complete rainbow palette. Swedish and American mycologists, building upon Rice's research, have discovered sources for true blues (''[[Sarcodon squamosus]]'') and mossy greens (''[[Hydnellum geogenium]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Beebee, Dorothy M. [http://www.mushroomsforcolor.com/ "Mushrooms for Color."] 30 Nov 2010 (retrieved 9 Jan 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hypholoma fasciculare]]'' provides a yellow dye, and fungi such as ''[[Phaeolus schweinitzii]]'' and ''[[Pisolithus tinctorius]]'' are used in dyeing textiles and paper.&lt;ref&gt;Beebee, Dorothy M. [http://www.turkeyredjournal.com/archives/V14_I1/rice.html "Miriam C. Rice and Mushrooms for Color."] ''Turkey Red Journal.'' Fall 2008 (retrieved 9 Jan 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luxury dyestuffs==
[[File:Justinian.jpg|thumb|right|Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] clad in Tyrian purple, 6th-century mosaic at [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]]]]
From the second millennium BC to the 19th century, a succession of rare and expensive natural dyestuffs came in and out of fashion in the ancient world and then in Europe.  In many cases the cost of these dyes far exceeded the cost of the wools and silks they colored, and often only the finest grades of fabrics were considered worthy of the best dyes.

===Royal purple===
The premier luxury dye of the ancient world was [[Tyrian purple]] or royal purple, a purple-red dye which is extracted from several genera of [[sea snail]]s, primarily the spiny dye-murex ''[[Murex brandaris]]'' (currently known as ''Bolinus brandaris'').  Murex dye was greatly prized in antiquity because it did not fade, but instead became brighter and more intense with weathering and sunlight.  Murex dyeing may have been developed first by the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]s of East Crete or the West Semites along the [[Levant]]ine coast, and heaps of crushed murex shells have been discovered at a number of locations along the eastern Mediterranean dated to the mid-2nd millennium BC. The classical dye known as Phoenician Red was also derived from murex snails.&lt;ref name="Barber228"&gt;Barber (1991), pp. 228–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Murex dyes were fabulously expensive&amp;nbsp;– one snail yields but a single drop of dye&amp;nbsp;– and the [[Roman Empire]] imposed a strict monopoly on their use from the reign of [[Alexander Severus]] (AD 225–235) that was maintained by the succeeding [[Byzantine Empire]] until the [[Early Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Munro56"&gt;Munro, John H. "The Anti-Red Shift – To the Dark Side: Colour Changes in Flemish Luxury Woollens, 1300–1500".  In Netherton and Owens-Crocker (2007), pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; The dye was used for imperial manuscripts on [[purple parchment]], often with text in silver or gold, and ''[[porphyrogenitos]]'' or "[[born in the purple]]" was a term for Byzantine offspring of a reigning Emperor.  The color matched the increasingly rare purple rock [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], also associated with the imperial family.

===Crimson and scarlet===
Tyrian purple retained its place as the premium dye of Europe until it was replaced "in status and desirability"&lt;ref name="Schoeser118"&gt;Schoeser (2007), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; by the rich [[crimson]] reds and scarlets of the new [[silk]]-[[weaving]] centers of Italy, colored with [[Kermes (dye)|kermes]].   Kermes is extracted from the dried unlaid eggs of the insect ''[[Kermes vermilio]]'' or ''Kermococcus vermilio'' found on species of [[oak]] (especially the [[Kermes oak]] of the [[Mediterranean]] region).  The dye is of ancient origin; jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave-burial at Adaoutse, [[Bouches-du-Rhône]].&lt;ref name="Barber230"&gt;Barber (1991), pp. 230–31&lt;/ref&gt; Similar dyes are extracted from the related insects ''Porphyrophora hamelii'' ([[Armenian cochineal]]) of the [[Caucasus]] region, ''Porphyrophora polonica''&lt;!--''Coccus polonicus''--&gt; ([[Polish cochineal]] or Saint John's blood) of Eastern Europe, and the [[lac]]-producing insects of India, [[Southeast Asia]], China, and [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;Barber (1991), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Munro214"&gt;Munro, John H. "Medieval Woollens: Textiles, Technology, and Organisation". In Jenkins (2003), pp. 214–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1982), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

When kermes-dyed textiles achieved prominence around the mid-11th century, the dyestuff was called "grain" in all Western European languages because the desiccated eggs resemble fine grains of wheat or sand.&lt;ref name="Munro56" /&gt;  Textiles dyed with kermes were described as ''dyed in the grain''.&lt;ref name="Munro214" /&gt; Woollens were frequently dyed in the fleece with woad and then piece-dyed in kermes, producing a wide range colors from blacks and grays through browns, [[murrey]]s, purples, and [[sanguine]]s.&lt;ref name="Munro214" /&gt;  By the 14th and early 15th century, brilliant ''full grain'' kermes scarlet was "by far the most esteemed, most regal" color for luxury woollen textiles in the [[Low Countries]], England, France, Spain and Italy.&lt;ref name="Munro56" /&gt;

[[Cochineal]] (''Dactylopius coccus'') is a [[scale insect]] of [[Central America|Central]] and [[North America]] from which the [[crimson]]-coloured dye [[carmine]] is derived. It was used by the [[Aztec]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] peoples. [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]] in the 15th century collected tribute in the form of bags of cochineal dye.&lt;ref name="tym"&gt;{{cite web |author=Threads In Tyme, LTD | title=Time line of fabrics | work= |url=http://threadsintyme.tripod.com/id63.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028155009/http://threadsintyme.tripod.com/id63.htm |archivedate=2005-10-28 | accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] cochineal began to be exported to Spain, and by the seventeenth century it was a commodity traded as far away as India.  During the colonial period the production of cochineal (in Spanish, ''grana fina'') grew rapidly. Produced almost exclusively in [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] by indigenous producers, cochineal became Mexico's second most valued export after silver.&lt;ref name="behan"&gt;{{cite web | author=Behan, Jeff | title=The bug that changed history | work= |url=http://www.gcrg.org/bqr/8-2/bug.htm | accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochineal produces purplish colors alone and brilliant scarlets when mordanted with tin; thus cochineal, which produced a stronger dye and could thus be used in smaller quantities, replaced kermes dyes in general use in Europe from the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schoeser (2007), pp. 121, 248&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barber (1982), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rise of formal black===
During the course of the 15th century, the civic records show brilliant reds falling out of fashion for civic and high-status garments in the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] in favor of dark blues, greens, and most important of all, black.&lt;ref name="Munro76"&gt;Munro (2007), pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Munro87"&gt;, Munro (2007), pp. 87–93.&lt;/ref&gt;  The origins of the trend for somber colors are elusive, but are generally attributed to the growing influence of [[Spain]] and possibly the importation of Spanish [[merino]] wools.  The trend spread in the next century: the Low Countries, [[Germany|German states]], [[Scandinavia]], England, France, and Italy all absorbed the sobering and formal influence of Spanish dress after the mid-1520s.&lt;ref name="Munro87" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, François: ''20,000 Years of Fashion'', pp. 219, 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Producing fast black in the Middle Ages was a complicated process involving multiple dyeings with woad or indigo followed by mordanting, but at the dawn of [[Early Modern period]], a new and superior method of dyeing black dye reached Europe via Spanish conquests in the New World.  The new method used logwood (''[[Haematoxylum campechianum]]''), a dyewood native to Mexico and Central America. Although logwood was poorly received at first, producing a blue inferior to that of woad and indigo, it was discovered to produce a fast black in combination with a [[ferrous sulfate]] (copperas) mordant.&lt;ref name="Schoeser118"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Munro87" /&gt;  Despite changing fashions in color, logwood was the most widely used dye by the 19th century, providing the sober blacks of formal and [[mourning]] clothes.&lt;ref name="Schoeser118"/&gt;

==Decline and rediscovery==
[[File:Morris Tulip and Willow 1873 small.jpg|left|thumb|Indigo-dyed and [[textile printing|discharge-printed]] textile, William Morris, 1873]]
The first synthetic dyes were discovered in the mid-19th century, starting with [[William Henry Perkin]]'s [[mauveine]] in 1856, an [[aniline dye]] derived from [[coal tar]].&lt;ref name="Thompson10"&gt;Thompson &amp; Thompson (1987), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alizarin]], the red dye present in madder, was the first natural pigment to be duplicated synthetically, in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Samuel Bien, Josef Stawitz, Klaus Wunderlich "Anthraquinone Dyes and Intermediates" in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim: 2005. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a02}}355.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the collapse of the market for naturally grown madder.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1982), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;  The development of new, strongly colored aniline dyes followed quickly: a range of reddish-purples, blues, violets, greens and reds became available by 1880. These dyes had great affinity for animal fibres such as wool and silk.  The new colors tended to fade and wash out, but they were inexpensive and could be produced in the vast quantities required by textile production in the [[industrial revolution]]. By the 1870s commercial dyeing with natural dyestuffs was fast disappearing.&lt;ref name="Thompson10" /&gt;

At the same time the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist and founding figure of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] [[William Morris]] took up the art of dyeing as an adjunct to his manufacturing business, the design firm of [[Morris &amp; Co.]] Always a medievalist at heart, Morris loathed the colors produced by the fashionable aniline dyes. He spent much of his time at his [[Staffordshire]] dye works mastering the processes of dyeing with plant materials and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods.   One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing as a practical industry and generally to renew the use of natural dyes like madder which had been driven almost out of use by the commercial success of the anilines. Morris saw dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons as the necessary preliminary to the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and his period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in the revival of carpet- and [[tapestry]]-weaving as fine arts.  Morris &amp; Co. also provided naturally dyed silks for the [[embroidery]] style called [[art needlework]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of National Biography'' (1901), "William Morris"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parry (1983), pp. 36–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists continued to search for new synthetic dyes that would be effective on [[cellulose]] fibres like cotton and linen, and that would be more colorfast on wool and silk than the early anilines.  Chrome or mordant dyes produced a muted but very fast color range for woollens.  These were followed by [[acid dye]]s for animal fibres (from 1875) and the synthesis of indigo in Germany in 1880.  The work on indigo led to the development of a new class of dyes called [[vat dye]]s in 1901 that produced a wide range of fast colors for cellulosic fibers such as cotton.&lt;ref name="Thompson11"&gt;Thompson &amp; Thompson (1987), pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;  Disperse dyes were introduced in 1923 to color the new textiles of [[cellulose acetate]], which could not be colored with any existing dyes.  Today disperse dyes are the only effective means of coloring many synthetics.  [[Reactive dye]]s for cotton were introduced in the mid-1950s. These petroleum based, synthetic dyes are used both in commercial textile production and in craft dyeing and have widely replaced natural dyes.&lt;ref name="Thompson11" /&gt;

In America, synthetic dyes became popular among a wide range of Native American textile artists; however, natural dyes remained in use, as many textile collectors prefer natural dyes over synthetics.  Today, dyeing with natural materials is often practiced as an adjunct to hand[[spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[knitting]] and [[weaving]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1982), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; It remains a living craft in many traditional cultures of North America, Africa, Asia, and the Scottish Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow &amp; Sentance (1999), pp. 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2208">'''Petroleum geochemistry''' is the branch of geochemistry which deals with the application of chemical principles in the study of the origin,generation,migration, accumulation, and alteration of petroleum...(John M. Hunt, 1979).&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, J.M., 1979. ''Petroleum Geochemistry and Geology''. Freeman, San Francisco {{ISBN|0-7167-1005-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Petroleum]] is generally considered oil and [[natural gas]]es having various compounds composed of primarily hydrogen and carbon.  They are usually generated from the decomposition and/or thermal maturation of [[organic matter]].  The organic matter originated from [[plant]]s and [[algae]].  The organic matter is deposited after the death of the plant in [[sediments]], where after considerable time, heat, and pressure the compounds in the plants and algae are altered to oil, gas, and [[kerogen]].  Kerogen can be thought of as the remaining solid material of the plant.  The sediment - usually [[clay]] and/or calcareous (lime) ooze, [[Lithification|hardens]] during this [[Diagenesis|alteration process]] into [[Rock (geology)|rock]] i.e. [[shale]] and/or [[limestone]].  The shale or limestone rock containing the organic matter is called the [[source rock]] because it is the source, having generated the petroleum.

In our quest to find more oil and gas, we use numerous petroleum [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] techniques to (1) identify source rocks and determine the amount, type, and maturation level of the organic matter; (2) evaluate the potential timing of petroleum migration from the source rock; (3) assess the potential migration pathways; and (4) correlate petroleum compounds found in reservoirs, leaks, and surface seeps to find new pools of petroleum. Some of the petroleum geochemical techniques used are: [[stable isotope]]s; hydrocarbon analysis (fingerprinting) of specific organic compounds (biological organic markers) with [[gas chromatography]] (GC) and gas chromatography-[[mass spectrometry]] (GC-MS); maturity indicators like [[vitrinite]] reflectance; laboratory [[pyrolysis]] and analysis; kerogen typing; and other more exotic techniques.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="861">'''Prognostic equation''' - in the context of physical (and especially geophysical) simulation, a prognostic equation predicts the value of variables for some time in the future on the basis of the values at the current or previous times. 

For instance, the well-known [[Navier-Stokes equations]] that describe the time evolution of a fluid are prognostic equations that predict the future distribution of velocities in that fluid on the basis of current fields such as the [[pressure gradient]].

The '''Rattlesnake Formation''' is a [[Miocene]] to late [[Pliocene]] [[geologic formation]] found along the [[John Day River|John Day River Valley]] of [[Oregon]], in the [[Western United States]].

==Description==
The formation is described in ''Geologic Formations of Eastern Oregon'' (1972) as follows: 
 The unit is composed of up to 700 feet of [[Conglomerate (geology)|fanglomerate]] and finer terrestrial sediments and a 40-foot thick [[ignimbrite]] unit which crops out in the middle of the section. The gravel is well rounded and consists of pebbles of [[basalt]], [[chert]], [[siltstone]], [[diorite]], [[rhyolite]], and chert set in a medium-grained matrix of poorly indurated volcanic sandstone. The ignimbrite displays zonation typical of welded ashflow [[tuff]]s and is a prominent [[Cliff-former|ridge former]].&lt;ref&gt;''Geologic Formations of Eastern Oregon'' (East of longitude 121°30'), 1972.  John D. Beaulieu.  [http://www.oregongeology.org/pubs/B/B-073.pdf Bulletin 73].  Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age==
The ignimbrite was [[Radiometric dating|radiometrically dated]] by the [[K–Ar dating|Potassium–argon method]] at 6.4 million years by Evernden and James (1964).&lt;ref&gt;Evernden, J. F., and James, G. T., 1964. Potassium-argon dates of the Tertiary floras of North America: Am. Jour. Sci., v. 262, p. 945-974.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fossils==
Middle and late Pliocene [[mammal]]s have been recovered from beneath the ignimbrite.

Morrow-Tait began taking flying lessons in January 1946. On 18 August 1948, the then 24-year-old left behind her aeronautical engineer husband Norman&lt;ref name=CM&gt;{{cite news|title="Flying housewife" for divorce|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]]|date=12 June 1950|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49724860#pstart2027088}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their 18-month-old daughter Anna, and took off from [[Croydon]], England, in a single-engine [[Percival Proctor]] IV ''G-AJMU'', with 25-year-old Cambridge University graduate student Michael Townsend as navigator.&lt;ref name=Stinson/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyNews&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman Flier Carries Lucky Charms|newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|Daily News]]|date=19 August 1948|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article79687466}}&lt;/ref&gt; She named the aircraft "Thursday's Child" (who "has far to go" in the nursery rhyme "[[Monday's Child]]").

They traveled east. There were rough landings in [[Marseille]] (causing minor damage)&lt;ref name=Stinson/&gt; and [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name=MiamiNews/&gt; They also had to wait nearly seven weeks in [[Calcutta]], India, to replace the engine.&lt;ref name=Stinson/&gt; In Japan, extra fuel tanks were installed in the fuselage for the long flight across the Pacific Ocean. Even so, they reached [[Eareckson Air Station|Shemya Air Force Base]] in the [[Aleutians]] perilously low on fuel.&lt;ref name=Stinson/&gt; On 21 November 1948, they took off from [[Anchorage]], Alaska. However, the engine developed trouble and they were forced to land on the snow-covered [[Alaska Highway]] near [[Tok, Alaska]].&lt;ref name=Stinson/&gt; The situation looked bleak. They were nearly out of funds, and the aircraft was unrepairable.

Townsend returned to England to resume his studies, while Morrow-Tait set about trying to raise money to continue her journey.&lt;ref name=MiamiNews/&gt; Impressed by her resolve, some Americans started a fundraising drive and collected enough to buy her a [[Vultee BT-13 Valiant|1942 Vultee Valiant]] (NX54084), which she christened "Next Thursday's Child".&lt;ref name=Stinson/&gt; Reunited with Townsend, she again departed from Anchorage in August 1949. There were stops (and customs problems) in [[Minneapolis]] and [[Happy Valley-Goose Bay|Goose Bay]], Labrador. They then flew via Greenland and Iceland to [[Prestwick]], Scotland. On 19 August they reached Croydon.&lt;ref name=Stinson/&gt;

She gave birth to a son, Giles Townsend,&lt;ref name=CM/&gt; eight months later. On 2 February 1951, Norman Morrow-Tait was granted a divorce on the grounds of his wife's adultery with Michael Townsend.&lt;ref name=MiamiNews/&gt;

Richarda Morrow-Tait died on 17 December 1982 of a blood disease.&lt;ref name=wingnet/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1577">The '''Sauk sequence''' was the earliest of the six [[cratonic sequence]]s that have occurred during the [[Phanerozoic]] in [[North America]]. It was followed by the [[Tippecanoe sequence|Tippecanoe]], [[Kaskaskia sequence|Kaskaskia]], [[Absaroka sequence|Absaroka]], [[Zuñi sequence|Zuñi]], and [[Tejas sequence|Tejas]] sequences. 

It dates from the late [[Proterozoic]] through the early [[Ordovician]] periods, though the [[transgression (geology)|marine transgression]] did not begin in earnest until the middle [[Cambrian]].&lt;ref name="MonroeOther1997a"&gt;Monroe, JS, and R Wicander (1997) ''The Changing Earth: Exploring Geology and Evolution,'' 2nd ed. Belmont: West Publishing Company, 1997. {{ISBN|0-314-09577-2}} p. 533-534&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak, most of [[North America]] was covered by the shallow Sauk Sea, save for parts of the [[Canadian Shield]] and the islands of the [[Transcontinental Arch]]. The [[stratigraphy]] of the Sauk sequence indicates shallow-water deposition, primarily consisting of well-sorted [[sandstone]]s and [[clastic]] [[carbonate]]s. A marine regression ended the Sauk sequence early in the Ordovician, to be followed by the [[Tippecanoe sequence]] later in the period.&lt;ref name="MonroeOther1997a"/&gt;

'''Speleology''' is the scientific study of [[cave]]s and other [[karst]] features, their make-up, structure, physical properties, history, life forms, and the processes by which they form ([[speleogenesis]]) and change over time (speleomorphology). The term ''speleology'' is also sometimes applied to the recreational activity of [[exploration|exploring]] caves, but this is more properly known as ''[[caving]]'' or ''potholing'', or (not usually by participants) by the uncommon American term ''spelunking''. Speleology and caving are often connected, as the physical skills required for ''[[in situ]]'' study are the same.

Speleology is a cross-disciplinary field that combines the knowledge of [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], [[physics]], [[meteorology]] and [[cartography]] to develop portraits of caves as complex, evolving systems.

== History ==
Prior to the mid-nineteenth century the scientific value of caves was considered only in its contribution to other branches of science, and cave studies were considered part of the larger disciplines of [[geography]], [[geology]] or [[archaeology]]. Very little cave-specific study was undertaken prior to the work of [[Édouard-Alfred Martel]] (1859–1938), the 'father of modern speleology', who through his extensive and well-publicised cave explorations introduced in France the concept of speleology as a distinct area of study. In 1895 Martel founded the Société de Spéléologie, the first organization devoted to cave science in the world.

The growth of speleology is directly linked with that of the sport of [[caving]], both because of the stimulation of public interest and awareness, and the fact that most speleological field-work has been conducted by sport [[caver]]s.

== Cave geology, hydrogeology and biology ==
{{Main|karst}}

=== Geochemistry speleothems ===
{{Main|speleothem}}

== Cave cartography ==
{{Main|Cave survey}}
The creation of an accurate, detailed map is one of the most common technical activities undertaken within a cave. Cave maps, called ''surveys'', can be used to compare caves to each other by length, depth and volume, may reveal clues on [[speleogenesis]], provide a spatial reference for further scientific study, and assist visitors with route-finding.

== Cave biology ==
{{Main|biospeleology}}
Caves provide a home for many unique biota. Cave ecologies are very diverse, and not sharply distinct from surface habitats. Generally however, the deeper the cave becomes, the more rarefied the ecology.

Cave environments fall into three general categories:
* Endogean
:the parts of caves that are in communication with surface soils through cracks and rock seams, groundwater seepage, and root protrusion.
* Parahypogean
:the threshold regions near cave mouths that extend to the last penetration of sunlight.
* [[Hypogean]]
:or "true" cave environments. These can be in regular contact with the surface via wind and underground rivers, or the migration of animals, or can be almost entirely isolated. Deep hypogean environments can host autonomous ecologies whose primary source of energy is not sunlight, but chemical energy liberated from limestone and other minerals by [[Chemotroph|chemoautotrophic]] bacteria.

Cave organisms fall into three basic classes:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Cave organisms
! Latin
! English
! Definition
|-
| [[Troglobite|Troglobites]]
| cave dwellers
| are obligatory ''cavernicoles'', specialized for cave life. Some can leave caves for short periods, and may complete parts of their life cycles above ground, but cannot live their entire lives outside of a cave environment. Examples include chemotrophic bacteria, some species of [[flatworms]], [[glowworm|glowworms]], [[collembola]], and [[Northern Cavefish|blindfish]].
|-
| [[Troglophile|Troglophiles]]
| cave lovers
| can live part or all of their lives in caves, but can also complete a life cycle in appropriate environments on the surface. Examples include [[cave cricket]]s, [[bat]]s, [[millipede]]s, [[pseudoscorpion]]s and spiders.
|-
| [[Trogloxene|Trogloxenes]]
| cave guests
| frequents caves, and may require caves for a portion of its life cycle, but must return to the surface (or a ''parahypogean'' zone) for at least some portion of its life. Hibernating reptiles and mammals are the most widely recognized examples.
|}

There are also so-called ''accidental trogloxenes'' which are surface organisms that enter caves for no survival reason. Some may even be ''troglophobes'' (“cave haters”), which cannot survive in caves for any extended period. Examples include deer which fell through a sinkhole, frogs swept into a cave by a flash flood, etc.

The two factors that limit cave ecologies are generally energy and nutrients. To some degree moisture is always available in actively forming Karst caves. Cut off from the sunlight and steady deposition of plant detritus, caves are poor habitats in comparison with wet areas on the surface. The majority of energy in cave environments comes from the surplus of the ecosystems outside. One major source of energy and nutrients in caves is dung from trogloxenes, the majority of which is deposited by bats. Other sources are mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Paul Richter, ''Classifications of Cave Biota &amp; Cave Environments'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cave ecosystems are very fragile. Because of their rarity and position in the ecosystem they are threatened by a large number of human activities. Dam construction, limestone quarrying, water pollution and logging are just some of the disasters that can devastate or destroy underground biological communities.&lt;ref&gt;National Speleological Society, ''The Fragile Underground''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other areas of cave science ==
Speleologists also work with archaeologists in studying underground ruins, tunnels, sewers and aqueducts, such as the various inlets and outlets of the [[Cloaca Maxima]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=nat-geographic-cloaca-maxim&gt;{{Citation |title=Rome's Ruins |last=Bennett |first=Paul |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0607/feature3/ |date=July 2006 |publisher=[[National Geographic Magazine]] | accessdate=2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4113">'''Stone Paper''' (also traded as '''Modestone''', '''Rock Paper''', '''Paper from Waste Marble''', '''Mineral Paper''', '''Rich Mineral Paper''', '''Sustainable Paper''' or '''Eco Paper''') is a type of strong, and durable paper-like product manufactured from [[calcium carbonate]] bonded with [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE). It is used for stationery, leaflets, posters, books, magazines, bags, packaging, wallpaper, adhesives, tags, in-mould labels, plates, trays, containers, maps and many other uses.

==History==
The process for creating Stone Paper was first developed by Taiwan Lung Meng Tech Co. in [[Taiwan]] during the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwanlm.com/page002_eng.php?ab_ID=19 |title=About Us |publisher=Taiwan Lung Meng Technology Corporation Limited |accessdate=Dec 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone Paper has been patented in over 40 countries, where its products are marketed under a variety of other trade names such as Modestone, GPA UltraGreen, MIST Paper, Parax Paper, Terraskin, ViaStone, Kampier, CleanSlate, EmanaGreen and Rockstock, Pixz Printing, KYStone Paper and Nu Stone.

==Properties==
Stone Paper has a density range of 1.0-1.6g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is equal to, or slightly higher than ordinary paper, and a texture somewhat like that of the outer membrane of a boiled [[Egg (food)|egg]]. It may be recycled with Number 2 plastics or remade into Rich Mineral Paper again, and is not biodegradable but is [[photodegradation|photo-degradable]] and [[compost]]ible under commercial conditions.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} It is suitable for stationery, bags, packaging, adhesives, greaseproof paper, wrappers, containers and many other applications.

The {{definition span|RPD and RBD papers|explain=What're RBD &amp; RPD?|date=December 2015}} have a number of advantages over traditional paper made from [[wood pulp]]. Stone Paper collects no static charge, is acid-free with a neutral [[pH]], has no grain, is water, grease, and insect resistant, and tears with difficulty due to a [[latex]]-like texture.

Because it is not made from fibers, Stone Paper possesses a smoother surface than most traditional paper products, eliminating the need for a coating or lamination. The source of the calcium carbonate is waste material collected from marble quarries and offcuts which are ground and reduced to fine white [[calcium carbonate]] powder. The production of Stone Paper uses no water, acid, [[bleach]] or optical brighteners. Stone Paper is compatible with [[Inkjet printing|inkjet]] or [[solid ink]] printers e.g. Offset, Letterpress, gravure, flexographic, but does not respond well to very high temperature [[laser printers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kampier.com/en/comparison.php |title=Paper Made From Stone |publisher=Kampier.com |date=2005-11-30 |accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
*The making of maps, charts, field notebooks and waterproof journals that will resist tearing and stains and will not collapse in contact with water.
*Manufacturers' tags and labels that will stand up to deliberate mutilation or normal wear and tear
*Posters, banners and outdoor signs which will withstand weathering
*Manuals that will survive rough handling and constant use
*Packaging and wrapping which will only rip with difficulty
*Shopping and garbage bags that are durable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stone-paper.com.au/what.html |title=A revolutionary new paper made from stone |publisher=Stone-Paper |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lockergnome.com/news/2012/04/02/stone-paper/ |title=What is Stone Paper? |publisher=LockerGnome |date= |accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:3 phase AC waveform.svg|thumb|300px|right|One voltage cycle of a three-phase system, labeled 0 to 360° (2π radians) along the time axis. The plotted line represents the variation of instantaneous voltage (or current) with respect to time. This cycle repeats with a [[utility frequency|frequency]] that depends on the power system.]]
In [[electrical engineering]], '''three-phase''' electric power systems have at least three conductors carrying [[alternating current]] voltages that are offset in time by one-third of the period. A three-phase system may be arranged in delta (∆) or star (Y) (also denoted as wye in some areas). A wye system allows the use of two different voltages from all three phases, such as a 230/400&amp;nbsp;V system which provides 230&amp;nbsp;V between the neutral (centre hub) and any one of the phases, and 400&amp;nbsp;V across any two phases. A delta system arrangement only provides one voltage magnitude, however it has a greater redundancy as it may continue to operate normally with one of the three supply windings offline, albeit at 57.7% of total capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/socratic/output/deltawye_instructor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513004710/http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/socratic/output/deltawye_instructor.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-13 |df= }} public domain&lt;/ref&gt; Harmonic current in the neutral may become very large if non-linear loads are connected.

==Definitions==
[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - 3phase Elementary 6wire.jpg|thumb|300px|Elementary six-wire three-phase alternator, with each phase using a separate pair of transmission wires.]]
[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - 3phase Elementary 3wire.jpg|thumb|100px|Elementary three-wire three-phase alternator, showing how the phases can share only three transmission wires.]]
[[File:Transformator-3-fas.png|thumb|upright|Three-phase transformer. Each phase has its own pair of windings.]]
In a star (wye) connected topology, with rotation sequence L1 - L2 - L3, the time-varying instantaneous voltages can be calculated for each phase A,C,B respectively by:

: &lt;math&gt;V_{L1-N} = V_P \sin\left(\theta\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;V_{L2-N} = V_P \sin\left(\theta - \frac{2}{3}\pi\right) = V_P \sin\left(\theta + \frac{4}{3}\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;V_{L3-N} = V_P \sin\left(\theta - \frac{4}{3}\pi\right) = V_P \sin\left(\theta + \frac{2}{3}\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;V_P&lt;/math&gt; is the peak voltage,
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = 2\pi ft\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the phase angle in radians 
::&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time in seconds 
::&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency in cycles per second and
:voltages L1-N, L2-N and L3-N are referenced to the star connection point.

==Balanced loads==
Generally, in electric power systems, the loads are distributed as evenly as is practical between the phases. It is usual practice to discuss a balanced system first and then describe the effects of unbalanced systems as deviations from the elementary case.

===Constant power transfer  ===
An important property of three-phase power is that the instantaneous power available to a resistive load, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P \,=\, V I \,=\, \frac{1}{R}V^2&lt;/math&gt;, is constant at all times. Indeed, let 

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   P_{Li} &amp;= \frac{V_{Li}^{2}}{R} \\
  P_{TOT} &amp;= \sum_i P_{Li}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

To simplify the mathematics, we define a [[dimensionless quantity|nondimensionalized]] power for intermediate calculations, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p \,=\, \frac{1}{V_P^2}P_{TOT} R&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;p=\sin^{2} \theta+\sin^{2} \left(\theta-\frac{2}{3} \pi\right)+\sin^{2} \left(\theta-\frac{4}{3} \pi\right)=\frac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence (substituting back):

: &lt;math&gt;P_{TOT}=\frac{3 V_P^2}{2R}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since we have eliminated &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; we can see that the total power does not vary with time. This is essential for keeping large generators and motors running smoothly.

Notice also that using the root mean square voltage &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{V_p}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, the expression for &lt;math&gt;P_{TOT}&lt;/math&gt; above takes the following more classic form:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{TOT} = \frac{3V^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

The load need not be resistive for achieving a constant instantaneous power since, as long as it is balanced or the same for all phases, it may be written as

: &lt;math&gt;Z=|Z|e^{j\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;

so that the peak current is

: &lt;math&gt;I_P=\frac{V_P}{|Z|}&lt;/math&gt;

for all phases and the instantaneous currents are

: &lt;math&gt;I_{L1}=I_P\sin\left(\theta-\varphi\right)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_{L2}=I_P\sin\left(\theta-\frac{2}{3}\pi-\varphi\right)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_{L3}=I_P\sin\left(\theta-\frac{4}{3}\pi-\varphi\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Now the instantaneous powers in the phases are

: &lt;math&gt;P_{L1}=V_{L1}I_{L1}=V_P I_P\sin\left(\theta\right)\sin\left(\theta-\varphi\right)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P_{L2}=V_{L2}I_{L2}=V_P I_P\sin\left(\theta-\frac{2}{3}\pi\right)\sin\left(\theta-\frac{2}{3}\pi-\varphi\right)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P_{L3}=V_{L3}I_{L3}=V_P I_P\sin\left(\theta-\frac{4}{3}\pi\right)\sin\left(\theta-\frac{4}{3}\pi-\varphi\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Trigonometric identity#Angle sum and difference identities|angle subtraction formulae]]:

: &lt;math&gt;P_{L1}=\frac{V_P I_P}{2}\left[\cos\left(\varphi\right)-\cos\left(2\theta-\varphi\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P_{L2}=\frac{V_P I_P}{2}\left[\cos\left(\varphi\right)-\cos\left(2\theta-\frac{4}{3}\pi-\varphi\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P_{L3}=\frac{V_P I_P}{2}\left[\cos\left(\varphi\right)-\cos\left(2\theta-\frac{8}{3}\pi-\varphi\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

which add up for a total instantaneous power

: &lt;math&gt;P_{TOT}=\frac{V_P I_P}{2}\left\{3\cos\varphi-\left[\cos\left(2\theta-\varphi\right)+\cos\left(2\theta-\frac{4}{3}\pi-\varphi\right)+\cos\left(2\theta-\frac{8}{3}\pi-\varphi\right)\right]\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the three terms enclosed in square brackets are a three-phase system, they add up to zero and the total power becomes

: &lt;math&gt;P_{TOT}=\frac{3V_P I_P}{2}\cos\varphi&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;P_{TOT}=\frac{3V_P^2}{2|Z|}\cos\varphi&lt;/math&gt;
showing the above contention.

Again, using the root mean square voltage &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{V_p}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_{TOT}&lt;/math&gt; can be written in the usual form
:&lt;math&gt;P_{TOT}=\frac{3V^2}{Z}\cos\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

===No neutral current===
For the case of equal loads on each of three phases, no net current flows in the neutral. The neutral current is the inverted vector sum of the line currents. See [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
I_{L1} &amp;= \frac{V_{L1-N}}{R},\; I_{L2}=\frac{V_{L2-N}}{R},\; I_{L3}=\frac{V_{L3-N}}{R}\\
-I_{N} &amp;= I_{L1} + I_{L2} + I_{L3}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We define a non-dimensionalized current, &lt;math&gt;i=\frac{I_{N}R}{V_P}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  i &amp;= \sin\left(\theta\right) +  \sin\left(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right) + \sin\left(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)\\
    &amp;= \sin\left(\theta\right) + 2\sin\left(\theta\right) \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)\\
    &amp;= \sin\left(\theta\right) -  \sin\left(\theta\right)\\
    &amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since we have shown that the neutral current is zero we can see that removing the neutral core will have no effect on the circuit, provided the system is balanced. Such connections are generally used only when the load on the three phases is part of the same piece of equipment (for example a three-phase motor), as otherwise switching loads and slight imbalances would cause large voltage fluctuations.

==Unbalanced systems==
In practice, systems rarely have perfectly balanced loads, currents, voltages and impedances in all three phases. The analysis of unbalanced cases is greatly simplified by the use of the techniques of [[symmetrical components]]. An unbalanced system is analysed as the superposition of three balanced systems, each with the positive, negative or zero sequence of balanced voltages.

When specifying wiring sizes in a three-phase system, we only need to know the magnitude of the phase and neutral currents. The neutral current can be determined by adding the three phase currents together as complex numbers and then converting from rectangular to polar co-ordinates. If the three-phase root mean square (RMS) currents are &lt;math&gt;I_{L1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_{L2}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;I_{L3}&lt;/math&gt;, the neutral RMS current is:
: &lt;math&gt;I_{L1} + I_{L2} \cos\left(\frac{2}{3}\pi\right) + j I_{L2} \sin\left(\frac{2}{3}\pi\right) + I_{L3} \cos\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi\right) + j I_{L3} \sin\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt;

which resolves to
: &lt;math&gt;I_{L1} - I_{L2} \frac{1}{2} - I_{L3} \frac{1}{2} + j \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \left(I_{L2} - I_{L3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The polar magnitude of this is the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts, which reduces to&lt;ref name=Kelijik&gt;{{cite book|last=Keljik|first=Jeffrey|title=Electricity 3: Power Generation and Delivery|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning/Delmar|location=Clifton Park, NY|isbn=1435400291|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{I_{L1}^2 + I_{L2}^2 + I_{L3}^2 - I_{L1} I_{L2} - I_{L1} I_{L3} - I_{L2} I_{L3}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Non-linear loads===
With linear loads, the neutral only carries the current due to imbalance between the phases. Devices that utilize rectifier-capacitor front ends (such as switch-mode power supplies for computers, office equipment and the like) introduce third order harmonics. Third harmonic currents are in-phase on each of the supply phases and therefore will add together in the neutral which can cause the neutral current in a wye system to exceed the phase currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowenstein|first=Michael|title=The 3rd Harmonic Blocking Filter: A Well Established Approach to Harmonic Current Mitigation|url=http://www.iaei.org/magazine/2003/01/the-3rd-harmonic-blocking-filter-a-well-established-approach-to-harmonic-current-mitigation/|publisher=IAEI Magazine|accessdate=24 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327130618/http://www.iaei.org/magazine/2003/01/the-3rd-harmonic-blocking-filter-a-well-established-approach-to-harmonic-current-mitigation/|archivedate=27 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Enjeti|first=Prasad|title=Harmonics in Low Voltage Three-Phase Four-Wire Electric Distribution Systems and Filtering Solutions|url=http://www.pserc.wisc.edu/documents/general_information/presentations/pserc_seminars/pserc_seminars0/enjeti_slides.pdf|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Power Electronics and Power Quality Laboratory|accessdate=24 November 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613051835/http://www.pserc.wisc.edu/documents/general_information/presentations/pserc_seminars/pserc_seminars0/enjeti_slides.pdf|archivedate=13 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolving magnetic field==
Any polyphase system, by virtue of the time displacement of the currents in the phases, makes it possible to easily generate a magnetic field that revolves at the line frequency. Such a revolving magnetic field makes polyphase [[induction motor]]s possible. Indeed, where induction motors must run on single-phase power (such as is usually distributed in homes), the motor must contain some mechanism to produce a revolving field, otherwise the motor cannot generate any stand-still [[torque]] and will not start. The field produced by a single-phase winding can provide energy to a motor already rotating, but without auxiliary mechanisms the motor will not accelerate from a stop when energized.

A rotating magnetic field of steady amplitude requires that all three phase currents be equal in magnitude, and accurately displaced one-third of a cycle in phase. Unbalanced operation results in undesirable effects on motors and generators.

==Conversion to other phase systems==
Provided two voltage waveforms have at least some relative displacement on the time axis, other than a multiple of a half-cycle, any other [[polyphase system|polyphase]] set of voltages can be obtained by an array of passive [[transformer]]s. Such arrays will evenly balance the polyphase load between the phases of the source system. For example, balanced two-phase power can be obtained from a three-phase network by using two specially constructed transformers, with taps at 50% and 86.6% of the primary voltage. This [[Scott-T transformer|''Scott T'' connection]] produces a true two-phase system with 90° time difference between the phases. Another example is the generation of higher-phase-order systems for large [[rectifier]] systems, to produce a smoother [[direct current|DC]] output and to reduce the [[harmonic]] currents in the supply.

When three-phase is needed but only single-phase is readily available from the electricity supplier, a [[phase converter]] can be used to generate three-phase power from the single phase supply.

==System measurements==
It is possible to measure the power in a three-phase system using two transducers when there is no neutral, or three transducers when there is neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measurement of three-phase power with the 2-wattmeter method.|url=http://eelinux.ee.usm.maine.edu/courses/ele323/2-Wattmeters%20method.pdf}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blondel's theorem]] states that the number of measurement elements required is one less than the number of current-carrying conductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-ee.uta.edu/online/camacho/ee2446/Fall2009/Notes/Two-wattmeter-method%28E%29.pdf|title=THE TWO-METER WATTMETER METHOD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Total Carbon Column Observing Network''' (TCCON) is a global network of instruments that measure the amount of [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrous oxide]] and other [[trace gas]]es in the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. The TCCON ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|iː|k|ɒ|n}} {{respell|TEE|kon}}) began in 2004 with the installation of the first instrument in [[Park Falls, Wisconsin]], USA, and has since grown to 23 operational instruments worldwide, with 7 former sites.&lt;ref name="TCCON_GGG2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wunch|first1=D.|last2=Toon|first2=G.

This is achieved by measuring the atmospheric mass of carbon (the [[airborne fraction]]). The TCCON measurements have improved the scientific community's understanding of the [[carbon cycle]],&lt;ref name="NH Flux"&gt;Yang, Z., R. A. Washenfelder, G. Keppel-Aleks, N. Y. Krakauer, J. T.

(2009), The Need for Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Measurements from Space : Contributions from a Rapid Reflight of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/363474main_OCO_Reflight.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The TCCON provides the primary measurement validation dataset for the [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2|Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2)]] mission,&lt;ref name="OCO webpage"&gt;http://oco.jpl.nasa.gov/science/validation/&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used to validate other [[Space-based Measurements of Carbon Dioxide|space-based measurements of carbon dioxide]].

==History==
Part of the reason the TCCON was established was because of modeling errors between mixing efficiency between the [[planetary boundary layer|PBL]] and the free [[troposphere]].&lt;ref name="NH Flux"/&gt; Because TCCON measurements are of the entire column of atmosphere above a site (PBL and free troposphere are simultaneously measured) the measurements are an improvement over the traditional [[in situ]] near surface measurements in this regard. TCCON has improved the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mass gradient measurements between the northern and southern hemispheres.

The first annual TCCON meeting was in [[San Francisco, California]] in 2005. Every year a meeting is held in a location that rotates between North America, the Western Pacific, and Europe hosted by a participating institution. In 2015 the meeting was held at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="TCCON_sites"&gt;TCCON Webpage, https://tccon-wiki.caltech.edu/Sites, accessed February 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement technique==
The main instrument at each TCCON site is a [[Bruker]] IFS 125HR (HR for high resolution, ~0.02&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) or occasionally 120HR [[Fourier transform spectrometer]]. Sunlight is directed into the spectrometer by solar tracking mirrors and other optics. The spectrometers measure the absorption of direct sunlight by atmospheric [[trace gases]] primarily in the near [[infrared]] region. This [[remote sensing]] technique produces a precise and accurate measurement of the [[total column]] abundance of the [[trace gas]]. The main limitation to this technique is that measurements can not be recorded when it is not sunny (i.e. there are no measurements available at nighttime or when there is heavy cloud cover).&lt;ref name="TCCON_paper"&gt;Wunch, D., G. C. Toon, J.-F. L. Blavier, R. A. Washenfelder, J. Notholt, B. J. Connor, D. W. T. Griffith, V. Sherlock, and P. O. Wennberg (2011), The total carbon column observing network, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society - Series A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 369(1943), 2087-2112, {{doi|10.1098/rsta.2010.0240}}. Available from: http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.o.../2087.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participating sites and Institutions==
Current TCCON sites are located in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Korea]], [[Réunion]], and [[Ascension Island]].&lt;ref name="TCCON_GGG2014"/&gt; A former site was in [[Brazil]]. Sites can change when an instrument needs to be moved to a new location.

TCCON members collaborate from a variety of different institutions. In North America some of these include [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], [[Ames Research Center|NASA Ames]], and the [[University of Toronto]].  In Europe some of these include [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]], [[Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry]], [[University of Bremen]], [[Agencia Estatal de Meteorología]], [[Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy]], [[Finnish Meteorological Institute]], and [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]]. In the western Pacific some of these include [[University of Wollongong]], [[National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research]], [[National Institute for Environmental Studies]], [[JAXA]], and National Institute of Meteorological Research of the Republic of Korea.

New sites are admitted into the network when site investigators demonstrate required hardware, and data processing ability. Uniformity is maintained across the network by using the same FTS model and the same retrieval software. GGG is the software of the TCCON.&lt;ref name="TCCON_GGG2014"/&gt; It includes the I2S (interferogram to spectrum) [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]], and GFIT spectral fitting subroutines. GFIT is also the fitting algorithm that was used for ATMOS which flew on the [[Space Shuttle]],&lt;ref&gt;JPL NASA ATMOS webpage, http://remus.jpl.nasa.gov/atmos/onshuttle.html, accessed February 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and is used for spectral fitting of spectra obtained by a [[High-altitude balloon|balloon borne]] spectrometer.&lt;ref&gt;NASA JPL MkIV interferometer webpage https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/instrument/MkIV, accessed February 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Highlights of Data Use==
Data from each site is processed by the investigators that head that particular site. Atmospheric abundances of gases are uploaded and saved in uniform formats and data are hosted at [[Caltech]] with the Caltech Library and are available from http://tccondata.org. Data are made publicly available provided the data license is followed.&lt;ref&gt;TCCON data use policy webpage https://tccon-wiki.caltech.edu/Network_Policy/Data_Use_Policy, accessed February 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trail ethics''' deals with [[ethics]] as it applies to the use of [[trails]].  It is similar to both [[environmental ethics]] and [[human rights]] in that it deals with the shared interaction of [[human]]s and [[nature]].  There are multiple agencies and groups that support and encourage ethical behavior on trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = TREAD LIGHTLY  | work =  "We did not inherit the earth from our parents, we are borrowing it from our children."  | publisher = Cedar City Field Office, Bureau of Land Management  | date =   | url = http://www.ut.blm.gov/cedarcity_fo/cedarpages/blm_ccfo_tread_lightly.htm  | format = Web  | doi =  | accessdate = 2006-11-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061104115437/http://www.ut.blm.gov/cedarcity_fo/cedarpages/blm_ccfo_tread_lightly.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Isle Royale National Park  | work = Leave No Trace, Outdoor Skills and Ethics  | publisher =   | date = November 2004  | pages =   | url = https://cms.mwr.nps.gov/isro/planyourvisit/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&amp;pageid=79879  | format = PDF  | doi =   | accessdate = 2006-11-17  }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trail ethics applies to the use of trails, by [[pedestrian]]s, [[Dog walking|dog walkers]], [[Hiking|hiker]]s, [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpackers]], [[mountain biking|mountain bikers]], [[Equestrianism|equestrians]], [[Hunting|hunters]], and [[Off-roading|off-road vehicles]].

== Etiquette ==
Sometimes conflicts can develop between different types of users of a trail or pathway. Etiquette has developed to minimize such interference. Examples include:
* When two groups meet on a steep trail, a custom has developed in some areas whereby the group moving uphill has the [[Priority (right of way)|right-of-way]].&lt;ref name=etiquette&gt;{{cite web|title=Trail Etiquette|first=Melissa|last=Devaughn|work=Backpacker Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=22 January 2011|date=April 1997|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|page=40|issn=0277-867X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trail users generally avoid making loud sounds, such as shouting or loud conversation, playing music, or the use of mobile phones.&lt;ref name=etiquette/&gt; However, in bear country,  making noise is a safety precaution.
* Trail users tend to avoid impacting on the land through which they travel. Users can avoid impact by staying on established trails, and durable surfaces, not picking plants, or disturbing wildlife, and carrying garbage out. The [[Leave No Trace]] movement offers a set of guidelines for low-impact hiking: "Leave nothing but footprints. Take nothing but photos. Kill nothing but time. Keep nothing but memories".
* The feeding of wild animals is dangerous and can cause harm to both the animals and to other people.
* Mountain bikers must yield to ''both'' hikers and riders on horses (equestrians), unless the trail is clearly designated and marked for bike-only travel. Hikers yield to equestrians.

== Trails in urban areas ==
[[File:Stanley Seawall.jpg|left|thumb|[[Stanley Park]] seawall path, [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. which is divided so as to separate skaters and walkers]]

In the US off-road vehicle use on [[public land]] has been criticized by some members of the government&lt;ref name=fed&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/ohv/ http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/ohv/]&lt;/ref&gt; and environmental organizations including the [[Sierra Club]] and [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]].&lt;ref name=sierra1&gt;[http://www.sierraclub.org/policy/conservation/offroad.asp http://www.sierraclub.org/policy/conservation/offroad.asp] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201153933/http://www.sierraclub.org/policy/conservation/offroad.asp |date=2006-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wilderness010&gt;[http://www.wilderness.org/OurIssues/ORV/index.cfm?TopLevel=Home http://www.wilderness.org/OurIssues/ORV/index.cfm?TopLevel=Home] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214145958/http://www.wilderness.org/OurIssues/ORV/index.cfm?TopLevel=Home |date=2006-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have noted several consequences of illegal ORV use such as [[pollution]], [[trail]] damage, [[erosion]], [[land degradation]], possible [[extinction|species extinction]],&lt;ref name=CPC&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice|first=Kathleen C.|title=National Collection of Imperiled Plants - Pholisma sonorae|url=http://centerforplantconservation.org/Collection/CPC_ViewProfile.asp?CPCNum=3407|publisher=Center for Plant Conservation|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[habitat destruction]]&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/environment/la-na-lizard12jan12,1,6234267.story?coll=la-news-environment&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |deadurl=yes |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Mojave lizard may get protection; off-road vehicles are cited as threat |date=12 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204085512/http://www.latimes.com/news/science/environment/la-na-lizard12jan12,1,6234267.story?coll=la-news-environment&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |archivedate=December 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lvrj&gt;[http://www.lvrj.com/news/13702907.html http://www.lvrj.com/news/13702907.html]&lt;/ref&gt; which can leave hiking trails impassable.&lt;ref name=mnrespons&gt;[http://www.mnresponsiblerec.org/Library/reports/Off-roadvehicledamageinDuluth.htm http://www.mnresponsiblerec.org/Library/reports/Off-roadvehicledamageinDuluth.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711134359/http://www.mnresponsiblerec.org/Library/reports/Off-roadvehicledamageinDuluth.htm/ |date=2015-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ORV proponents argue that legal use taking place under planned access along with the multiple environment and trail conservation efforts by ORV groups will mitigate these issues. Groups such as the Blueribbon Coalition advocate Treadlightly, which is the responsible use of public lands used for off-road activities.

'''''Trishna''''' is a [[Swan 37]] [[yacht]] belonging to the [[Indian Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] of the [[Indian Army]]. The 1970-vintage boat, earlier known as ''Guinevere of Sussex'', was purchased in 1984 from the United Kingdom. The yacht has since been used for long distance ocean sailing and training. The first of the yachts' journeys after it was acquired was its voyage from [[Gosport]] to [[Mumbai]], India. Subsequently the yacht embarked on its most notable voyage, the [[circumnavigation]] of the globe from 1985 to 1987. This was the first such achievement by an Indian crew.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1051029/asp/atleisure/story_5410344.asp|title=An epic voyage|author= Banerjee-Bey, Yana|work=The Telegraph|date=29 October 2005|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, the yacht has been used for international cruises primarily in the Indian Ocean region and is currently still operational.

==Background==
The Sapper Adventure Foundation had sponsored a sailing expedition from [[Bombay]] to [[Bandar Abbas]], Iran in 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=35 days in an open boat |page= |date=1 December 1977 |work=Tehran Journal |location=Tehran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/TehranJournal01Dec1977/Tehran%20Journal_01%20Dec%201977#page/n0/mode/2up |title=Tehran Journal 01 Dec 1977 |publisher=Archive.org |date=1977-12-01 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an 18-foot 1921-vintage wooden Seabird&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombaysailing.com/seabirds.htm |title=Bombay Sailing Association |publisher=Bombaysailing.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Class sailboat ''Albatross''. This was an exercise to test the sailing capabilities of the sailors of the [[Indian Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] and a precursor to the circumnavigation of the globe by the [[Sappers]] on ''Trishna''.

==Purchase of boat and sail Gosport, England to Bombay, India==

The planning for the circumnavigation commenced in early 1980s and finally took off in 1984 when a team of officers from the Corps of Engineers flew to the U.K. to buy a boat and sail it back to India. Limited funds dictated the Sapper Adventure Foundation to purchase a second-hand sailboat for the venture. After an extensive survey of the second-hand boat market in the U.K., the crew shortlisted the 1970-vintage '''[[Nautor's Swan|Swan]] 37''' boat, ''Guinevere of Sussex'' based at [[Brighton]].&lt;ref name="Sappersto1985"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Sappers to go on world cruise |page= |date=7 February 1985 |work=Maharashtra Herald |location=Bombay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/MaharashtraHerald07Feb1985/Maharashtra%20Herald_07%20Feb%201985#page/n0/mode/2up |title=Maharashtra Herald 07 Feb 1985 |publisher=Archive.org |date=1985-02-07 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After purchase of the yacht, it was sailed by the crew to the Joint Services Sailing Center, [[Gosport]], U.K., where it underwent minor repairs and partial essential re-fit to make it sail-worthy for the voyage back to India. The crew also underwent sail training, which was organised under the aegis of the [[Royal Engineers]]&lt;nowiki&gt;. Major Ron Gravels, ex-RE, was engaged and he undertook a month-long sail training program for the crew on the Solent, English Channel crossings to [[Cherbourg]] culminating in a sail to the ports of &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Guernsey]] and [[Alderney]] in the [[Channel Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Indian Army team sails around the world |page= |date=11 October 1984 |work=India Weekly |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/IndiaWeeklyLondon11Oct1984/India%20Weekly%20London_11%20Oct%201984#page/n0/mode/1up |title=India Weekly London 11 Oct 1984 |publisher=Archive.org |date=1984-10-11 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Trishna'' set off on her first long distance voyage from the Joint Services Sailing Center, [[Gosport]], U.K. on 12 October 1984. With the onset of winter, the crew had a rough passage, especially in the [[Bay of Biscay]], [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Red Sea]]. With halts at [[Alderney]] (14 October), [[A Coruña]] (20 October), [[Lisbon]] (26 October), [[Gibraltar]] (1 November), [[Ibiza]] (7 November), [[Malta]] (17 November), [[Iraklion]] (24 November), [[Port Said]] (1 December) through the [[Suez Canal]], [[Port Sudan]] (15 December), [[Aden]] (30 December), [[Salalah]] (10 January 1985), [[Muscat, Oman]] (19 January) and [[Bombay]] (1 February 1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Unique sailing experience |page= |date=9 February 1985 |work=Blitz |location=Bombay }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=A big yachting adventure |page= |date=15 February 1985 |work=Evening News |location=New Delhi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Rousing reception to yacht Trishna |page= |date=2 February 1985 |work=Free Press Journal |location=Bombay }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ulvöspinel''' or '''ulvite''' is an iron titanium oxide mineral with formula: [[iron|Fe]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[titanium|Ti]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or  	TiFe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It forms brown to black metallic [[Cubic (crystal system)|isometric]] crystals with a [[Mohs hardness]] of 5.5 to 6. It belongs to the [[spinel group]] of minerals, as does [[magnetite]], Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

Ulvöspinel forms as [[solid solution]]s with magnetite at high temperatures and reducing conditions, and grains crystallized from some [[basalt]]-[[gabbro]] magmas are rich in the ulvöspinel component. The ulvöspinel component tends to oxidize to magnetite plus [[ilmenite]] during subsolidus cooling of the host rocks, and the ilmenite so produced may form apparent [[exsolution]] (trellis type) laminae in [[magnetite]]. The texture was once interpreted as indicating solid solution between ilmenite and magnetite, until the oxidation reaction and resultant textures were reproduced in laboratory experiments first described by Buddington and Lindsley (1964, Journal of Petrology 5, p.&amp;nbsp;310-357). The results are important to [[plate tectonics]] because magnetite is an important recorder of rock magnetism.

Ulvöspinel was first described from a [[dolerite]] layered intrusion in the Ulvö Islands, Ångermanland, [[Sweden]] in 1943. The locality is an iron, titanium and vanadium mining area that has been active since the 17th century. It is common in titaniferous magnetite iron ore deposits. It also occurs in [[kimberlite]]s, in some reduced iron-bearing [[basalt]]s and is common in [[moon|lunar]] basalts.

{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Vaisheshika''' or '''Vaiśeṣika''' ({{lang-sa|वैशेषिक}}) is one of the six orthodox schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] ([[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] systems) from ancient India. In its early stages, the Vaiśeṣika was an independent [[philosophy]] with its own metaphysics, epistemology, logic, ethics, and soteriology.&lt;ref&gt;Amita Chatterjee (2011), Nyāya-vaiśeṣika Philosophy, The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, {{doi|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195328998.003.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the Vaiśeṣika system became similar in its philosophical procedures, ethical conclusions and soteriology to the [[Nyaya|Nyāya]] school of Hinduism, but retained its difference in epistemology and metaphysics.

The [[epistemology]] of Vaiśeṣika school of Hinduism, like [[Buddhism]], accepted only two reliable means to knowledge: perception and inference.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt; Vaiśeṣika school and Buddhism both consider their respective scriptures as indisputable and valid means to knowledge, the difference being that the scriptures held to be a valid and reliable source by Vaiśeṣikas were the [[Vedas]].

Vaisheshika school is known for its insights in [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dale Riepe (1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pages 227-246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kak"&gt;Kak, S. 'Matter and Mind: The Vaisheshika Sutra of Kanada' (2016), Mount Meru Publishing, Mississauga, Ontario, {{ISBN|978-1-988207-13-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a form of [[atomism]] in natural philosophy.&lt;ref name=jganeri&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/early-modern-india/#VaiAto Analytical philosophy in early modern India] J Ganeri, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; It postulated that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to ''paramāṇu'' ([[atom]]s), and one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), quality, activity, commonness, particularity and inherence.&lt;ref name=olil&gt;Oliver Leaman, ''Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy.'' Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173629}}, 1999, page 269.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vaiśeṣika school, knowledge and liberation were achievable by a complete understanding of the world of experience.&lt;ref name=olil/&gt;

Vaiśeṣika [[Darśana|darshana]] was founded by [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kaṇāda Kashyapa]] around the 6th to 2nd century BC.{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|pp=98-99}}&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman (1999), ''Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy.'' Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173629}}, page 269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Ganeri (2012), The Self: Naturalism, Consciousness, and the First-Person Stance, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199652365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Although the Vaisheshika system developed independently from the Nyaya school of Hinduism, the two became similar and are often studied together. In its classical form, however, the Vaishesika school differed from the Nyaya in one crucial respect: where Nyaya accepted four sources of valid knowledge, the Vaishesika accepted only two.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt;

The [[epistemology]] of Vaiśeṣika school of Hinduism accepted only two reliable means to knowledge - perception and inference.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;

Vaisheshika espouses a form of [[atomism]], that the reality is composed of five substances (examples are earth, water, air, fire, and space). Each of these five are of two types, explains Ganeri,&lt;ref name=jganeri/&gt;  (paramāṇu) and composite. An Parmanu (Para means beyond and Anu means Atom or very small but divisible particle while parmanu is indivisible) is that which is indestructible , indivisible, and has a special kind of dimension, called “small” (aṇu). A composite is that which is divisible into parmanu. Whatever human beings perceive is composite, and even the smallest perceptible thing, namely, a fleck of dust, has parts, which are therefore invisible.&lt;ref name=jganeri/&gt; The Vaiśeṣikas visualized the smallest composite thing as a “triad” (tryaṇuka) with three parts, each part with a “dyad” (dyaṇuka). Vaiśeṣikas believed that a dyad has two parts, each of which is an atom. Size, form, truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of parmanus, their number and their spatial arrangements.

Vaisheshika postulated that what one experiences is derived from ''dravya'' (substance: a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), ''guna'' (quality), ''karma'' (activity), ''samanya'' (commonness), ''vishesha'' (particularity) and ''samavaya'' (inherence, inseparable connectedness of everything).&lt;ref name=olil/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120810860}}, pages 228-237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemology==
Hinduism identifies six ''[[Pramāṇa]]s'' as [[epistemology|epistemically]] reliable means to accurate knowledge and to truths:&lt;ref&gt;P Bilimoria (1993), Pramāṇa epistemology: Some recent developments, in Asian philosophy - Volume 7 (Editor: G Floistad), Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-5107-1}}, pages 137-154&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''Anumāna'' (inference), ''Upamāna'' (comparison and analogy), ''Arthāpatti'' (postulation, derivation from circumstances), ''Anupalabdhi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and ''Śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag&gt;

*'''''Pratyakṣa''''' (प्रत्यक्ष) means perception. It is of two types: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind.&lt;ref name=kamal&gt;MM Kamal (1998), The Epistemology of the Carvaka Philosophy, Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies, 46(2): 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B Matilal (1992), Perception: An Essay in Indian Theories of Knowledge, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198239765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism identify four requirements for correct perception:&lt;ref name=kpmat/&gt; ''Indriyarthasannikarsa'' (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), ''Avyapadesya'' (non-verbal; correct perception is not through [[hearsay]], according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), ''Avyabhicara'' (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and ''Vyavasayatmaka'' (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe).&lt;ref name=kpmat&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 160-168&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient scholars proposed "unusual perception" as ''pramāṇa'' and called it internal perception, a proposal contested by other Indian scholars. The internal perception concepts included ''pratibha'' (intuition), ''samanyalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and ''jnanalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 168-169&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the texts considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from ''Pratyakṣa-pranama'', so as to contrast ''nirnaya'' (definite judgment, conclusion) from ''anadhyavasaya'' (indefinite judgment).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 170-172&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Anumāna''''' (अनुमान) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason.&lt;ref&gt;W Halbfass (1991), Tradition and Reflection, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, page 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of ''Anumana''.&lt;ref name=kamal/&gt; In all except one Hindu philosophies,&lt;ref&gt;Carvaka school is the exception&lt;/ref&gt; this is a valid and useful means to knowledge. The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts: ''pratijna'' (hypothesis), ''hetu'' (a reason), and ''drshtanta'' (examples).&lt;ref name=jl4647&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Anumana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts, state the ancient Indian scholars: ''sadhya'' (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and ''paksha'' (the object on which the ''sadhya'' is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if ''sapaksha'' (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if ''vipaksha'' (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps. For example, they demand ''Vyapti'' - the requirement that the ''hetu'' (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in "all" cases, in both ''sapaksha'' and ''vipaksha''.&lt;ref name=jl4647/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0779-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a ''nigamana'' (conclusion).&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syllogism===
The syllogism of the {{IAST |Vaiśeṣika}} school was similar to that of the [[Nyāya]] school of Hinduism, but the names given by {{IAST |Praśastapāda}} to the 5 members of syllogism are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|2006|p=75ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The earliest systematic exposition of the Vaisheshika is found in the [[Vaisheshika Sutra|{{IAST |Vaiśeṣika Sūtra}}]] of {{IAST |Kaṇāda}} (or {{IAST |Kaṇabhaksha}}). This treatise is divided into ten books. The two commentaries on the {{IAST |Vaiśeṣika Sūtra}}, {{IAST |Rāvaṇabhāṣya}} and {{IAST |Bhāradvājavṛtti}} are no more extant. [[Prashastapada|{{IAST|Praśastapāda}}]]’s {{IAST |Padārthadharmasaṁgraha}} (c. 4th century) is the next important work of this school. Though commonly known as {{IAST |bhāṣya}} of {{IAST |Vaiśeṣika Sūtra}}, this treatise is basically an independent work on the subject. The next Vaisheshika treatise, Candra’s {{IAST |Daśapadārthaśāstra}} (648) based on {{IAST |Praśastapāda}}’s treatise is available only in Chinese translation. The earliest commentary available on {{IAST |Praśastapāda}}’s treatise is {{IAST |Vyomaśiva}}’s {{IAST |Vyomavatī}} (8th century). The other three commentaries are {{IAST |Śridhara}}’s {{IAST |Nyāyakandalī}} (991), Udayana’s {{IAST |Kiranāvali}} (10th century) and {{IAST |Śrivatsa}}’s {{IAST |Līlāvatī}} (11th century). {{IAST |Śivāditya}}’s  {{IAST |Saptapadārthī}} which also belongs to the same period, presents the {{IAST |Nyāya}} and the  {{IAST |Vaiśeṣika}} principles as a part of one whole. {{IAST |Śaṁkara Miśra}}’s {{IAST |Upaskāra}} on {{IAST |Vaiśeṣika Sūtra}} is also an important work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|2006|pp=180–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Categories or ''Padārtha''==
According to the Vaisheshika school, all things that exist, that can be cognized and named are {{IAST |''[[padārtha]]''}}s (literal meaning: the meaning of a word), the objects of experience. All objects of experience can be classified into six categories, ''dravya'' (substance), {{IAST |''guṇa''}} (quality), ''karma'' (activity), {{IAST |''sāmānya''}} (generality),  {{IAST |''viśeṣa''}} (particularity) and {{IAST |''samavāya''}} (inherence). Later {{IAST |Vaiśeṣika}}s ({{IAST |Śrīdhara}} and Udayana and {{IAST |Śivāditya}}) added one more category ''[[abhava]]'' (non-existence). The first three categories are defined as ''artha'' (which can perceived) and they have real objective existence. The last three categories are defined as {{IAST |''budhyapekṣam''}} (product of intellectual discrimination) and they are logical categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|2006|pp=183–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Dravya'' (substance): The substances are conceived as 9 in number. They are, {{IAST |''pṛthvī''}} (earth), ''ap'' (water), ''tejas'' (fire), {{IAST |''vāyu''}} (air),  {{IAST |''ākaśa''}} (ether),  {{IAST |''kāla''}} (time), ''dik'' (space), {{IAST |''ātman''}} (self or soul) and ''manas'' (mind). The first five are called {{IAST 
|''bhūta''}}s, the substances having some specific qualities so that they could be perceived by one or the other external senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chattopadhyaya|1986|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{IAST |''Guṇa''}} (quality): The {{IAST |Vaiśeṣika Sūtra}} mentions 17 {{IAST |guṇa}}s (qualities), to which {{IAST |Praśastapāda}} added another 7. While a substance is capable of existing independently by itself, a {{IAST |guṇa}}(quality) cannot exist so. The original 17 {{IAST |guṇa}}s (qualities) are, {{IAST |''rūpa''}} (colour), ''rasa'' (taste), ''gandha'' (smell), {{IAST |''sparśa''}} (touch), {{IAST |''saṁkhyā''}} (number),  {{IAST |''parimāṇa''}}  (size/dimension/quantity), {{IAST |''pṛthaktva''}} (individuality), {{IAST |''saṁyoga''}} (conjunction/accompaniments), {{IAST |''vibhāga''}} (disjunction), ''paratva'' (priority), ''aparatva'' (posteriority), ''buddhi'' (knowledge), ''sukha'' (pleasure), {{IAST |''duḥkha''}} (pain), {{IAST |''icchā''}} (desire),  {{IAST |''dveṣa''}} (aversion) and ''prayatna'' (effort). To these {{IAST |Praśastapāda}} added ''gurutva'' (heaviness), ''dravatva'' (fluidity), ''sneha'' (viscosity), ''dharma'' (merit), ''adharma'' (demerit), {{IAST |''śabda''}} (sound) and {{IAST |''saṁskāra''}} (faculty).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|2006|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Karma'' (activity): The ''karma''s (activities) like {{IAST |guṇa}}s (qualities) have no separate existence, they belong to the substances. But while a quality is a permanent feature of a substance, an activity is a transient one. {{IAST|''Ākāśa''}} (ether), {{IAST |''kāla''}} (time), ''dik'' (space) and {{IAST |''ātman''}} (self), though substances, are devoid of ''karma'' (activity).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|2006|pp=208–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{IAST |''Sāmānya''}} (generality): Since there are plurality of substances, there will be relations among them. When a property is found common to many substances, it is called {{IAST |''sāmānya''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|2006|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{IAST |''Viśeṣa''}} (particularity): By means of {{IAST |''viśeṣa''}}, we are able to perceive substances as different from one another. As the ultimate atoms are innumerable so are the {{IAST |''viśeṣa''}}s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|2006|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{IAST |''Samavāya''}} (inherence): {{IAST |Kaṇāda}}  defined {{IAST |''samavāya''}} as the relation between the cause and the effect.  {{IAST |Praśastapāda}}  defined it as the relationship existing between the substances that are inseparable, standing to one another in the relation of the container and the contained. The relation of {{IAST |''samavāya''}} is not perceivable but only inferable from the inseparable connection of the substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|2006|pp=216–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The atomic theory==
According to the {{IAST |Vaiśeṣika}} school, the {{IAST |''trasareṇu''}} are the smallest ''mahat'' (perceivable) particles and defined as {{IAST |tryaṇuka}}s (triads). These are made of three parts, each of which are defined as {{IAST |dvyaṇuka}} (dyad). The  {{IAST |dvyaṇuka}}s are conceived as made of two parts, each of which are defined as {{IAST |paramāṇu}} (atom). The {{IAST |paramāṇu}}s (atoms) are indivisible and eternal, they can neither be created nor destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chattopadhyaya|1986|pp=169–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each {{IAST |paramāṇu}} (atom) possesses its own distinct {{IAST |viśeṣa}} (individuality).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|2006|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure of the partless atoms is known as ''parimaṇḍala parimāṇa''. It is eternal and it cannot generate the measure of any other substance. Its measure is its own absolutely.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dasgupta|1975|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;
