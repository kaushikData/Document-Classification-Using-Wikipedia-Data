      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9435">'''AGROVOC''' (a portmanteau of agriculture and vocabulary) is a multilingual controlled vocabulary covering all areas of interest to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), including food, nutrition, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and the environment. The vocabulary consists of over 35,000 concepts with up to 671,000 terms in different languages (see [http://agrovoc.uniroma2.it/agrovoc/agrovoc/en/ SKOSMOS]). It is a collaborative effort, edited by a community of experts and coordinated by FAO.

AGROVOC is made available by FAO as an [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[SKOS]]-XL concept scheme and published as a [[linked data]] set aligned to 18 other vocabularies.

==History==
AGROVOC was first published at the beginning of the 1980s by FAO in English, Spanish and French to serve as a controlled vocabulary to index publications in agricultural science and technology, especially for [[AGRIS]].

In the 1990s, AGROVOC abandoned paper printing and went digital with data storage handled by a relational database. In 2004, preliminary experiments with expressing AGROVOC into the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) took place. At the same time a web based editing tool was developed, then called WorkBench, nowadays VocBench. In 2009 AGROVOC became an SKOS resource.

Today, AGROVOC is available in [http://aims.fao.org/vest-registry/vocabularies/agrovoc different languages] as an [http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/skos-xl.html SKOS-XL] concept scheme and published as a [http://lod-cloud.net/ Linked Open Data (LOD)] set aligned to 18 other data sets related to agriculture.

==Users==
AGROVOC is used by researchers, librarians and information managers for indexing, retrieving and organizing data in agricultural information systems and web pages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aims.fao.org/standards/agrovoc/uses-agrovoc AGROVOC Uses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505125853/http://aims.fao.org/standards/agrovoc/uses-agrovoc |date=2014-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of the [[Semantic Web]] also new users are emerging, like software developers and ontology builders.

==Access==
AGROVOC is accessible in various ways:

* [http://agrovoc.uniroma2.it/agrovoc/agrovoc/en/ SKOSMOS]: Online Search and browse of AGROVOC concepts.  
* [http://aims.fao.org/agrovoc/releases Download: RDF-SKOS (AGROVOC only or AGROVOC LOD)]. 
* Live: [http://agrovoc.uniroma2.it:3030/agrovoc/sparql SPARQL endpoint] and the [http://agrovoc.uniroma2.it:8080/SKOSWS/services/SKOSWS?wsdl AGROVOC Web services].

==Maintenance==
The AGROVOC team, located at FAO, coordinates the editorial activities related to the maintenance of AGROVOC. The actual maintenance is carried out by a community of editors and institutions&lt;ref&gt;[http://aims.fao.org/standards/agrovoc/community AGROVOC people]&lt;/ref&gt; for each of the language versions.

The tool used by the community to edit and maintain AGROVOC is [http://agrovoc.uniroma2.it:8080/vocbench2Agrovoc/ Vocbench], which was designed to meet the needs of the Semantic Web and linked data environments. VocBench provides tools and functionalities that facilitate both collaborative editing and multilingual terminology. It also includes administration and group management features that permit flexible roles for maintenance, validation and quality assurance.

FAO also facilitates the technical maintenance of AGROVOC, including its publication as a [http://aims.fao.org/standards/agrovoc/access-agrovoc LOD resource]. Technical support and infrastructure is provided by the University of Tor Vergata&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.uniroma2.it/ Tor Vergata University]&lt;/ref&gt; (Rome, Italy) which leads the technical development of VocBench. 

==Structure==
All 35,000+ concepts of the AGROVOC thesaurus are hierarchically organized under 25 top concepts. AGROVOC top concepts are very general and high level concepts, like “activities”, “organisms”, “location”, “products” etc. More than half of the total number of concepts (20,000+) fall under the top concept “organism”, which confirms how AGROVOC is largely oriented towards the agricultural sector.

AGROVOC is an RDF/SKOS-XL concept scheme, meaning the conceptual and terminological level are separated. The basic notions for such a concept scheme are: concepts, their labels and relations.

*'''Concepts''' 
Concepts are anything we want to represent or “talk about” in our domain. Concepts are represented by terms. A concept could also be considered as the set of all terms used to express it in various languages.
In SKOS, concepts are formalized as skos:Concept, identified by dereferenceable URIs (= URL). For example, the AGROVOC concept with URI http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_12332 is for ''maize''.

*'''Terms''' 
Terms are the actual terms used to name a concept. For example ''maize'', ''maïs'', ''玉米'', ''ข้าวโพด'' are all terms used to refer to the same concept in English, French, Chinese and Hindi respectively.

AGROVOC terms are expressed by means of the SKOS extension for labels, SKOS-XL. The predicates used are:
skosxl:prefLabel, used for preferred terms (“descriptors” in thesaurus terminology), and 
skosxl:altLabel, used for non- preferred terms.

*'''Relations'''
In SKOS, hierarchical relations between concepts are expressed by the predicates skos:broader, skos:narrower. They correspond to the classical thesaurus relations broader/narrower (BT/NT).

Non-hierarchical relations express a notion of “relatedness” between concepts. AGROVOC uses the SKOS relation skos:related (corresponding to the classical thesaurus RT), and a specific vocabulary of relations called Agrontology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aims-fao.atlassian.net/wiki/display/AGV/Agrontology Agrontology]&lt;/ref&gt;

AGROVOC also allows for relations between labels (i.e. terms), thanks to the SKOS-XL extension to SKOS.

==Linked data==
AGROVOC is available as a linked data set and is aligned (linked) with 18 vocabularies related to agriculture (see table down below). The linked data version of AGROVOC is exposed as RDF and HTML, through a content-negotiation mechanism. It is also exposed through a SPARQL endpoint.

The advantage of having a thesaurus like AGROVOC published as LOD is that once thesauri are linked, the resources they index are linked as well. A good example is AGRIS, a mash-up web application that links the AGRIS bibliographic repository (indexed with AGROVOC) to related web resources (indexed with vocabularies linked to AGROVOC).

In [[Japanese mythology]], the {{nihongo|'''Age of the Gods'''|神代|'''Kamiyo''' or '''Jindai'''}} is the period preceding the accession of [[Jimmu]], the first [[Emperor of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Jindai''" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 421|page=421}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt; The kamiyo myths are chronicled in the "upper roll" (''Kamitsumaki'') of the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and in the first and second chapters of the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''. The reigns of Emperor Jimmu and the subsequent monarchs are considered the {{nihongo|'''Human Age'''|人代|'''Hitoyo'''}}.

== Origin ==
{{See also|Japanese creation myth}}
 [[File:Japan yashima.png|right|220px]] 
According to early mythology, the Japanese islands were created by [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]], meaning "he who invites" and "she who invites". They find themselves on a heavenly golden bridge staring down at earth and its oceans. With their jeweled spear, called ''[[Amenonuhoko]]'', given by the gods or kami before them, they dip the spear into the ocean, creating the islands of Japan, [[Onogoro Island]] (“spontaneous-congealed island”).&lt;ref&gt;( F. Hadland, Davis, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Descending down from the skies, Izanagi and Izanami create their home and create a central Heavenly August pillar. Deciding to populate the land, Izanagi circles the left side of the pillar while Izanami circles the right. Meeting each other on the other side of it, Izanami greets her love “oh, what a comely young man.” Izanagi replies with “How delightfully, I have met a lovely maiden.” Izanami being a woman speaking first to a man, the gods looked at this as inappropriate and cursed the couple by the children they bore. 
Their first child [[Hiruko]] was born hideous and cast out for its atrocity. Trying and trying again, they fail to conceive a proper child. The gods explain to them both about their curse and decide to give them another chance. Once again Izanagi and Izanami circle the pillar just as before, only Izanagi speaks first.  Their mating now was fruitful. Izanami gave birth to the islands of ''[[Awaji Island|Awaji]]'', ''Iyo'' (later [[Shikoku]]), ''[[Oki Islands|Oki]]'', ''Tsukushi'' (later [[Kyūshū]]), ''[[Iki Island|Iki]]'', ''[[Tsushima Island|Tsushima]]'', ''[[Sado, Niigata|Sado]]'', and finally ''Yamato'' (later [[Honshū]]), the largest. They named the land ''Oyashimakuni'', the Land of Eight Great Islands. After that, Izanami gave birth in quick succession to the other minor islands that surround the main ones, and to the main kami of sea
and harbor, of wind, trees, mountains, and so on.

Many other kami were born from Izanami’s womb such as [[Amaterasu]], the Sun Goddess. She
was known as "Heaven-Illumine-of-Great-Deity”, and the Moon God, Tsukiyumi ([[Tsukuyomi]]). His silver radiance was not so fair as the golden effulgence of his sister, the Sun Goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hadland Davis, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While both sit atop the heavens, they begin their sibling rivalry, quarreling and fighting, they decide they can no longer see each other face to face, thus creating day and night, separating the two.

The last kami conceived was the fire god, [[Kagutsuchi]]. During birth, Kagutsuchi severely burned Izanami and eventually slipped away into the Land of [[Yomi]], the [[underworld]]. “The tears Izanagi shed at the death of his wife brought forth further deities. Angered by the sight of the newly born fire kami who had been the cause of Izanami’s death, Izanagi drew his sword and decapitated the infant. The blood coalescing on the sword brought forth eight martial kami, including the important ''[[Takemikazuchi]]-no-kami'' and his peer, ''[[Futsunushi]]-no-kami''. Eight more fierce kami of mountains and iron emerged from the infant’s body and limbs.”&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hadland  Davis, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In his anguish, Izanagi followed her to the underworld to rescue her and soon discovered the awful truth. Nothing remained of his beloved Izanami but a rotting living-dead corpse. As Izanagi runs away in horror, Izanami shrieks in anger for her loves abandonment, “Everyday I shall kill one thousand people in the lands we created”. Izanagi replies “Every day I shall create one thousand five hundred people”.

The '''Air Force Space and Missile Museum''' is located at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 26|Launch Complex 26]] at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[Florida]].  It includes artifacts from the early American space program and includes an outdoor [[rocket garden]] displaying rockets, missiles and space-related equipment chronicling the [[US Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Florida Today]]. ''The Fact Book: Your Guide to [[Brevard County, Florida|Brevard County]]'' (Melbourne, Florida: Florida Today, February 28, 2004), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is accessible to the public as a part of the "Cape Canaveral Early Space Tour" offered by the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] four days per week.  Free tours were also offered by the Air Force [[45th Space Wing]] Community Relations office until June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://afspacemuseum.org/visit/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sands Space and Missile History Center, a companion to the museum, is open to the general public six days a week. The History Center is located just outside the south gate of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afspacemuseum.org/visit/index.htm "Visit the Museum" Air Force Space and Missile Museum] Retrieved March 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sands Space History Center==
[[File:Sands Space History Center, Cape Canaveral, FL, US.jpg|right|thumb|Sands Space History Center]]
The Sands Space History Center (formerly known as the United States Air Force Space and Missile History Center) is an extension of the Air Force Space and Missile Museum outside the gate 1 of the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] which opened to the public August 14, 2010.  It is located in a {{convert|3200|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility and highlights the progress and history of the space program.&lt;ref name=AFHC&gt;[[Brevard Business News]].

'''András Hess''' set up a printing press in Buda in 1472.

The '''BFI TV 100''' is a list compiled in 2000 by the [[British Film Institute]] (BFI), chosen by a poll of industry professionals{{huh|date=April 2018}}, to determine what were the greatest [[United Kingdom|British]] television programmes of any genre to have been screened.

==Selection and criteria==
[[File:BBC TV Centre.jpg|thumb|right|The [[BBC]] produced 70 of the 100 programmes on the list.]]
[[File:Granada TV.jpg|thumb|right|[[Granada Television]] produced 7 of the 100 programmes on list - the largest by a commercial broadcaster.]]
Initially, a 'big list' of 650 programmes was drawn up by BFI personnel, and this provisional list was then distributed to 1,600 television industry professionals in the UK,&lt;ref name=Barnes/&gt; who were each given 30 votes. The listing was split into six categories: Single Dramas, Drama Series and Serials, Comedy and Variety, Factual, Children's / Youth, and Lifestyle &amp; Light Entertainment. Each voter was required to cast a minimum of three votes in every category. News stories were mostly excluded, with exceptions such as the coverage of the death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], on the basis that it would be impossible to determine whether it was the coverage or the news itself that made them important. Sport was excluded for similar reasons, and also because many events such as the [[Football World Cup 1966|1966 World Cup]], while important to those in England, would not necessarily matter to those in other areas of the United Kingdom.

Some programmes are represented on the list by an entire series. For some series, such as the anthology ''[[The Wednesday Play]]'' and current affairs show ''[[This Week (Thames Television, UK)|This Week]]'', individual episodes are listed. Television programmes no longer existing in the archives were excluded from consideration.

The judges were also asked to name their top overseas programme; the winner was the US sitcom ''[[Frasier]]''.&lt;ref name=Barnes/&gt;

The '''blue grenadier''', '''hoki''', '''blue hake''', '''New Zealand whiptail''', '''whiptail''' or '''whiptail hake''' (''Macruronus novaezelandiae'') is a [[Merlucciidae|merluccid hake]] of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Merlucciidae]] found around southern [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], as well as off both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America from [[Peru]] to [[Brazil]]&lt;ref name = Filho&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Alfredo Carvalho-Filho | author2 = Guy Marcovaldi | author3 = Claudio L.S.

It feeds in midwater on small squids, [[crustacean]]s, and fish.  Its length is between {{convert|60|and|120|cm|in|abbr=on}}. It is a slender, silvery fish similar in appearance to the [[Silver gemfish|gemfish]]. The meat of the fish is white and almost always sold in fillets.

==Commercial use==
Australian supermarkets have many hoki products, mainly in pre-packaged processed foods.
Often the manufactured meat result is manufactured into a fish cutlet shape and then battered or crumbed to further give a good fresh look.

The hoki is one of the species used in [[McDonald's]] [[Filet-O-Fish]], Fish Fingers and McFish sandwiches.&lt;ref name="NYTHoki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miamiherald"&gt;{{Citation |last=Vasquez |first=Michael |date=August 24, 2009 |title=Fish or Fake?

The blue grenadier is a very important commercial species in Australia.&lt;ref name="fishes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bray|first1=Dianne|title=Blue Grenadier, Macruronus novaezelandiae|url=http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/home/species/2857#moreinfo|website=Fishes of Australia|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are mostly caught in the south-east, off southern New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia and are considered very good eating, particularly when fresh.&lt;ref name="fishes" /&gt;

== Sustainable consumption ==

The blue grenadier is the subject of a large commercial fishery industry in New Zealand, which has been certified by the [[Marine Stewardship Council]] (MSC) as well-managed and sustainable in March 2001. New Zealand has established a [[fishing quota]] of about 100,000 tons.&lt;ref name="NYTHoki" /&gt; The first MSC certification ended in April 2007. Reassessment of the certification commenced in early 2005 and finished in October 2007.&lt;ref name="MSCcertification"&gt;[http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/pacific/new-zealand-hoki/meet-the-fishers "Meet the fishers."] [[Marine Stewardship Council]]. No date. Accessed 2009-09-10&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article raised questions over the sustainability of blue grenadier fishing practices around New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/science/10fish.html|last=Broad |first=William|date=September 9, 2009|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=From Deep Pacific, Ugly and Tasty, With a Catch}}&lt;/ref&gt; though its conclusions were disputed by New Zealand representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Gaines |date=September 22, 2009 |title=New York Times' report on food fish raises New Zealand industry's ire |newspaper=[[Gloucester Daily Times]] |url=http://www.gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_265000018.html |first=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent quotas on catches have been reduced by nearly two thirds from 275,000 to 100,000 tons.

In 2010, [[Greenpeace|Greenpeace International]] added the blue grenadier (hoki) to its seafood red list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species/ Greenpeace International Seafood Red list].

In September 2013, as New Zealand Hoki, it continued to appear on the MSC's list of sustainable fish.&lt;ref name="MSC Recommendation"&gt;[http://www.msc.org/where-to-buy/product-finder/product_search?keywords=&amp;species=hoki&amp;country=US&amp;submit=Go "Sustainable Seafood Shopping."] [[Marine Stewardship Council]].

The '''''Chronica Gentis Scotorum''''' or '''''Chronicles of the Scottish People''''' was the first substantial work of [[Scottish history]]. It was written by [[John of Fordun]], a [[priest]] of the [[diocese]] of [[St Andrews| St. Andrews]] and [[chaplain]] of the church of [[Aberdeen]]. Before his death, he had finished the first five books down to the reign of [[David I of Scotland | David I]] (1124-53) and had arranged his remaining materials, the last of which was dated 1385.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skene|first1=William F.|title=Chronicles of the Picts, Chronicles of the Scots, and Other Early Memorials of Scottish History|date=1867|location=Edinburgh|page=ix|url=https://archive.org/stream/chroniclesofpict00sken#page/n15/mode/2up|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Continuations==
[[Andrew of Wyntoun]], a [[Canons regular | canon regular]] of St. Andrews and [[prior]] to the [[St Serf's Inch Priory]] in [[Loch Leven (Kinross)|Loch Leven]], wrote a [[chronicle]] of Scotland between 1420 and 1424, but his work shows no familiarity with Fordun’s.  However, in 1441, [[Walter Bower]] (or Bowmaker), [[abbot]] of [[Inchcolm Abbey | Inchcolm]], continued Fordun’s history to the year 1437, adding material to the death of [[James I of Scotland | James I]] (1437), incorporating additional material, and entitling his work the [[Scotichronicon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skene|title=Chronicles|page=ix-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Copies were preserved in leading religious houses by whose names the manuscripts are known, including the Book of [[Paisley Abbey | Paisley]], the Book of [[Scone Abbey | Scone]], the Book of [[Cupar]], and the Chronicle of [[Iona | Icolmkill]]. Though the names of Patrick Russell, a [[Carthusians | Carthusian]] [[monk]] of the [[monastery]] of [[Charterhouse (monastery) | Charterhouse]] in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], and Magnus MacCulloch, [[secretary]] to the [[archbishop]] of St. Andrews, are attached to some of these copies, they remain in essence Walter Bower’s compilations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skene|title=Chronicles|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key features of the chronicle==
According to historian [[William F. Skene]], the key features of Fordun’s history of early Scotland include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skene|title=Chronicles|page=x-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Scoti | Scots]] derived their origin from [[Goídel Glas | Gathelus]], son of Neolus, king of [[Greece]], who, in the time of [[Moses]], went to [[Egypt]], where he married [[Scota]], a daughter of the [[pharaoh]], after which he led the Scots to [[Spain]].
* From Spain, several groups went to [[Ireland]], the last of which was under the leadership of Simon Breac, son of the king of Spain, who brought with him the [[Stone of Scone]], the [[coronation]] seat of the Scottish kings, which, according to Fordun, was [[marble]]. 
* Under Breac’s great-grandson, Ethachius Rothay, the Scots went to [[Albion]], renaming it [[Scotia]].  The [[Picts]] then settled in Scotland and intermarried with the Scots.
* In 330 BC, during the time of their king Ferchard, the Scots chose the king’s son [[Fergus Mór | Fergus]] as their leader. Fergus, whose territory extended from the sea and the [[Outer Hebrides | western isles]] to Drumalban, brought the coronation stone from Ireland.
* Rether, the great-grandson of Fergus, brought over another colony of Scots from Ireland and united them with the Scots already established on the mainland and the islands.
* In AD 203, the Scots converted to [[Christianity]].
* In AD 360, Eugenius, king of the Scots, was killed by the Picts and [[Celtic Britons | Britons]], who drove the Scots (under the leadership of Ethodius and Erth, brother and nephew of Eugenius, respectively) back to Ireland.
* After their departure, the [[Relic | relics]] of St. Andrew, according to Fordun, were brought to Scotland and received by Hurgurst, king of the Picts. 
* In AD 403, the Scots returned under the leadership of Erth, son of Fergus, and occupied [[Argyll | Ergadia]]. Erth was the ancestor of forty-five Scots kings, ending with [[Kenneth MacAlpin]], who led the Scots out or Ergadia, conquered the Picts, and reigned over the whole of Scotland.
* Fordun concluded with a list of Scottish kings from Kenneth MacAlpin to David I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35667">This article presents a succinct '''comparison''' of the features, platform support, and packaging of many independent implementations of [[Domain Name System]] ('''DNS''') '''[[name server]] software'''.

== Servers compared ==
Each of these [[Domain Name System|DNS]] servers is an independent implementation of the DNS protocols, capable of resolving DNS names for other computers, publishing the DNS names of computers, or both. Excluded from consideration are single-feature DNS tools (such as proxies, filters, and firewalls) and redistributions of servers listed here (many products repackage BIND, for instance, with proprietary user interfaces).

DNS servers are grouped into several categories of specialization of servicing domain name system queries.  The two principal roles, which may be implemented either uniquely or combined in a given product are:
* '''Authoritative server''': [[authoritative name server]]s publish DNS mappings for domains under their ''authoritative'' control. Typically, a company (e.g. "Acme Example Widgets") would provide its own authority services to respond to address queries, or for other DNS information, for ''www.example.int''.  These servers are listed as being at the top of the authority chain for their respective domains, and are capable of providing a definitive answer.  Authoritative name servers can be ''primary name servers'', also known as ''master'' servers, i.e. they contain the original set of data, or they can be ''secondary'' or ''slave name servers'', containing data copies usually obtained from synchronization directly with the master server, either via a DNS mechanism, or by other data store synchronization mechanisms.
* '''Recursive Servers''': [[Domain Name System#Recursive and caching name server|recursive servers]] (sometimes called "DNS caches", "caching-only name servers") provide DNS name resolution for applications, by relaying the requests of the client application to the chain of authoritative name servers to fully resolve a network name. They also (typically) cache the result to answer potential future queries within a certain expiration ([[Time to live|time-to-live]]) period. Most Internet users access a ''recursive server'' provided by their internet service provider to locate internet [[Host (network)|hosts]] such as ''[[example.com|www.example.com]]''.

===[[AnswerX]]===
AnswerX is Akamai’s recursive DNS resolver (rDNS). It has evolved from the Xerocole acquisition. AnswerX is a modern resolver, supporting DNSSEC, IPv6, and full subscriber aware policy controls. It can be used for DNS firewall functionality, extensive logging, and a platform for service creation. AnswerX is sold as software working on common servers (no specialized hardware). The software is built to process millions of transactions per second on standard hardware.

=== [[BIND]] ===
BIND is the ''[[de facto standard]]'' DNS server. It is a [[free software]] product and is distributed with most Unix and Linux platforms, where it is most often also referred to as ''named'' (name daemon). It is the most widely deployed DNS server.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;{{cite web | last = Moore | first = Don | year = 2004 | url = http://mydns.bboy.net./survey/ | title = DNS server survey | accessdate = 2005-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, BIND underwent three major revisions, each with significantly different architectures: BIND4, BIND8, and BIND9. BIND4 and BIND8 are now technically obsolete and not considered in this article. BIND9 is a ground-up rewrite of BIND featuring complete [[Domain Name System Security Extensions|DNSSEC]] support in addition to other features and enhancements.

[[Internet Systems Consortium]] started development of a new version, BIND 10.  Its first release was in April 2010, but ISC involvement concluded with the release of BIND 10 version 1.2 in April 2014.  ISC cited a lack of resources to continue development of BIND 10, and they reaffirmed their commitment to BIND9.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isc.org/blogs/isc-concludes-bind-10-development-with-release-1-2-project-renamed-bundy/&lt;/ref&gt;

The BIND 10 codebase continues on as an open source project at http://bundy-dns.de/ (''ibid''.)  It is not included in this comparison at this time.

=== [[Cisco Network Registrar]] ===
CNR includes a commercial DNS server from [[Cisco Systems]] usually used in conjunction with the CNR DHCP ([[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]]) server.  It supports high rates of dynamic update.

=== [[Dnsmasq]] ===
Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder, designed to provide DNS (and optionally [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] and [[Trivial File Transfer Protocol|TFTP]]) services to a small-scale network. It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global DNS.

Dnsmasq accepts DNS queries and either answers them from a small, local cache or forwards them to a real, recursive DNS server. It loads the contents of [[Hosts (file)|/etc/hosts]], so that local host names which do not appear in the global DNS can be resolved.

=== [[djbdns]] ===
Djbdns is a collection of DNS applications, including ''tinydns'', which was the second most used [[free software]] DNS server in 2004.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; It was designed by [[Daniel J. Bernstein]], author of [[qmail]], with an emphasis on security considerations. In March 2009, Bernstein paid $1000 to the first person finding a security hole in djbdns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.network.djbdns/13864|title=The djbdns prize claimed|accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Source code]] is not centrally maintained and was released into the public domain in 2007. As of March 2009, there are three [[Fork (software development)|forks]] and more than a dozen [[Patch (computing)|patches]] to add additional features to djbdns{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.

=== gdnsd ===
gdnsd [https://github.com/blblack/gdnsd] is a [[GPL3]]-licensed Authoritative DNS server written in C using libev [http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html] and [[pthreads]] with a focus on high performance, low latency service. It does not offer any form of caching or recursive service, and does not support [[DNSSEC]]. The initial "g" stands for Geographic, as gdnsd offers a plugin system for geographic (or other sorts of) balancing, redirection, and service-state-conscious failover.

=== [[Knot DNS]] ===
Knot DNS is a [[free software]] authoritative DNS server by [[CZ.NIC]].  Knot DNS aims to be a fast, resilient DNS server usable for infrastructure (root and TLD) and [[DNS]] hosting services.  Knot DNS supports [[DNSSEC]] signing and among others hosts root zone (K and L [[Root_name_server]]s), several [[top-level domain]]s.

=== [[MaraDNS]] ===
MaraDNS is a [[free software]] DNS server by Sam Trenholme that claims a good security history and ease of use.&lt;ref&gt;

Windows DNS Server &lt;ref&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/dns&lt;/ref&gt; component of Microsoft DNS. The same software can be configured to support authoritative, recursive and hybrid mode. The software is integrated with [[Active Directory]] which makes it the default DNS software for many enterprise networks that are based on [[Active Directory]]. It also allows creating zones by the standard DNS [[zone file]]. The software comes packaged as a role in windows server. The server software is shipped with a cmdline interface dnscmd,&lt;ref&gt;https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc756116(v=ws.10).aspx&lt;/ref&gt; a DNS management GUI wizard, and a DNS [[PowerShell]]&lt;ref&gt;https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj649850.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; package. In Windows Server 2012, the Windows DNS added support for DNSSEC,&lt;ref&gt;https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn593694&lt;/ref&gt; with full-fledged online signing, with [[Dynamic DNS]] and [[NSEC3]] support, along with RSASHA and ECDSA signing algorithms. It provides an inbuilt key storage provider and support for any third party CNG compliant key storage provider. User interface and [[PowerShell]] support for managing DNS and DNSSEC were improved as well.
In the Windows Server 2016, the DNS Server supports DNS policies using which the admins can have more control over the name resolution process.&lt;ref&gt;https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn765484.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

It supports DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS protocol support for forwarders. It can be used on Linux &amp; macOS using Mono Framework or .NET Core.

== Features ==
Some DNS features are relevant only to recursive servers, or to authoritative servers. As a result, a feature matrix such as the one in this article cannot by itself represent the effectiveness or maturity of a given implementation.

Another important qualifier is the server architecture. Some DNS servers provide support for both server roles in a single, "monolithic" program. Others are divided into smaller programs, each implementing a subsystem of the server. As in the classic Computer Science [[microkernel]] debate, the importance and utility of this distinction is hotly debated. The feature matrix in this article does not discuss whether DNS features are provided in a single program or several, so long as those features are provided with the base server package and not with third-party add-on software.

=== Explanation of features ===
; Authoritative
: A major category of DNS server functionality, see above.

; Recursive
: A major category of DNS server functionality, see above.

; Recursion Access Control
: Servers with this feature provide control over which hosts are permitted DNS recursive lookups. This is useful for load balancing and service protection.

; Slave Mode
: Authoritative servers can publish content that originates from primary data storage (such as zone files or databases connected to business administration processes)--such servers are also called 'master' servers--or can be ''slave'' or ''secondary'' servers, republishing content fetched from and synchronized with such master servers. Servers with a "slave mode" feature have a built-in capability to retrieve and republish content from other servers. This is typically, though not always, provided using the [[AXFR]] DNS protocol.

; Caching
: Servers with this feature provide recursive services for applications, and cache the results so that future requests for the same name can be answered quickly, without a full DNS lookup. This is an important performance feature, as it significantly reduces the latency of DNS requests.

; DNSSEC
: Servers with this feature implement some variant of the [[Domain Name System Security Extensions|DNSSEC]] protocols. They may publish names with resource record signatures (providing a "secure authority service"), and may validate those signatures during recursive lookups (providing a "secure resolver"). DNSSEC is becoming more widespread as the deployment of a DNSSEC root key has been done by ICANN.  Deployment to individual sites is growing as top level domains start to deploy DNSSEC too. The presence of DNSSEC features is a notable characteristic of a DNS server.

; TSIG
: Servers with this feature typically provide DNSSEC services. In addition, they support the [[TSIG]] protocol, which allows DNS clients to establish a secure session with the server to publish [[Dynamic DNS]] records or to request secure DNS lookups without incurring the cost and complexity of full DNSSEC support.

; IPv6
: Servers with this feature are capable of publishing or handling DNS records that refer to [[IPv6]] addresses. In addition to be fully IPv6 capable they must implement IPv6 transport protocol for queries and zone transfers in slave/master relationships and forwarder functions.

; Wildcard
: Servers with this feature can publish information for [[Wildcard DNS record|wildcard records]], which provide data about DNS names in DNS zones that are not specifically listed in the zone.

; Split horizon
: Servers with the [[split-horizon DNS]] feature can give different answers depending on the source IP address of the query.

&lt;ref name=bind_web&gt;A BIND configuration module is available for Webmin in many Linux distributions.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=djbslave&gt;djbdns provides facilities to transfer zones; after completing the zone transfer, djbdns can act as an authoritative server for that zone. Consult the [http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/axfr-get.html axfr-get] documentation for further information.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=djbdns_dnssec&gt;A patch for publishing authoritative DNSSEC-protected data is available at [http://www.tinydnssec.org].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=locations&gt;This is not the same as views in bind. But it is a solution with comparable capabilities. See: [http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tinydns-data.html#differentiation section of tinydns-data].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=masqauth&gt;dnsmasq has limited authoritative support, intended for internal network use rather than public Internet use. A records are supported via /etc/hosts, and there is some MX, TXT and SRV record support via the command line.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=maraslave&gt;MaraDNS cannot directly provide slave support. Instead, a zone transfer is needed, after which MaraDNS will act as an authoritative server for that zone. See [http://www.maradns.org/tutorial/dnsslave.html DNS Slave] for further information.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=msdns_dnssec&gt;[[Windows Server 2008 R2]] [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd378952(WS.10).aspx supports DNSSEC], however [[dynamic DNS]] is not supported for DNSSEC-signed zones. It is [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200224.aspx fully supported] in [[Windows Server 2012]]. For earlier versions, including Windows Server 2003, [[Domain Name System Security Extensions|DNSSEC]] functionality must be [http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/en/Library/6e5ef496-7411-44ee-9b83-578238b8ec241033.mspx manually activated in the registry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325113621/http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6E5EF496-7411-44EE-9B83-578238B8EC241033.mspx |date=2008-03-25 }}. In these versions, the DNSSEC support is sufficient to act as a slave/secondary server for a signed zone, but not sufficient to create a signed zone (lack of key generation and signing utilities).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=msdns_tsig&gt;Microsoft DNS supports the [[Generic Security Service Algorithm for Secret Key Transaction|GSS-TSIG algorithm]] for Secure Dynamic Update when integrated with [[Active Directory]], using [http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3645.txt RFC 3645], an application of GSS-API [http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2743.txt RFC 2743].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=msdns_ipv6&gt;[[IPv6]] functionality in the Microsoft DNS server is only available on Windows Server 2003 and newer.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=msdns_wmi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682857.aspx |title=Microsoft DNS WMI Provider Specification |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=msdns_api&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682085(VS.85).aspx |title=Microsoft DNS Server API Reference |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=msdns_rpc&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc448821.aspx MS-DNSP DNS Server Management Protocol Specification] (uses [[Remote Procedure Call|RPC]]s)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=sdns_views&gt;Simple DNS Plus does not have "views" in the same way as BIND, but has a "NAT IP Alias" feature which allows host records to resolve to different IP addresses depending on where the DNS request comes from.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=powerdns_views&gt;Use the geoip backend for a split-horizon configuration.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=powerdns_slave6&gt;IPv6 master/slave support in PowerDNS is incomplete in versions &lt;3.0. Zone transfers in master/slave replication over IPv6 is supported since 3.0.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=powerdns_dnssec&gt;Full DNSSEC support in PowerDNS arrived in version 3.0. In lower versions, it is currently restricted to being able to serve [http://doc.powerdns.com/types.html DNSSEC-related RRs].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=powerdns_web&gt;[https://www.powerdns.com/third-party.html Powerdns.com suggested enhancements at]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=djbdns_wild&gt;djbdns supports [[wildcard DNS record]]s, but not in a way that conforms with the RFCs.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=masqdnssec&gt;DNSSEC validation was added in Dnsmasq version 2.69 [http://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/2014q2/008416.html]. Earlier versions could only pass through validation results from their own upstream nameservers.[http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=masqsplit&gt;Dnsmasq can do basic split-horizon DNS based on the '''interface''' of the source request using the ''[http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html localise-queries]'' configuration parameter.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=msdns_policies&gt;In Windows Server technical Preview (2016), you can create DNS policies to control how a DNS Server handles DNS queries based on different parameters. This supports Recursion control, location aware responses, split-brain deployment, filters etc. ''[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn765484.aspx]'' configuration parameter.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Platforms ==
In this overview of [[operating system]] support for the discussed DNS server, the following terms indicate the level of support:
* ''No'' indicates that it does not exist or was never released.
* ''Partial'' indicates that while it works, the server lacks important functionality compared to versions for other OSs; it is still being developed however.
* ''Beta'' indicates that while a version is fully functional and has been released, it is still in development (e.g. for stability).
* ''Yes'' indicates that it has been officially released in a fully functional, stable version.
* ''Included'' indicates that the server comes pre-packaged with or has been integrated into the operating system.

This compilation is not exhaustive, but rather reflects the most common platforms today.

&lt;ref name=ntbind&gt;BIND is available for [[Windows NT]]-based systems (including [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP|XP]], and [[Windows Server 2003|Server 2003]]) in a port known as ntbind.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=msdns_included_functionality&gt;The functionality available with the Microsoft DNS server varies depending on the version of the underlying operating system; such as most Windows Server components, it is upgraded only with the rest of the operating system. Certain functionality, such as [[Domain Name System Security Extensions|DNSSEC]] and [[IPv6|IPv6 support]], is only available in the Windows Server 2000-2003 version. Windows 2000 Server includes [[TSIG]] support. The Microsoft DNS Server is not available on Windows client operating systems such as Windows XP.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, CQ ceased to exist as a separate entity, and in July 2018, a deal was announced for the company to be acquired by [[FiscalNote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Economist Group to sell CQ Roll Call to FiscalNote |date=2018-07-25 |author=Calderone, Michael |work=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CQ Building Entrance.jpg|thumb|Since April 2011, the merged CQ Roll Call has been located in the [[NoMa, Washington, D.C.|NoMa]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
CQ was founded in 1945 by [[Nelson Poynter]] and his wife, [[Henrietta Poynter]], with the aim of providing a link between local [[newspaper]]s and the complex politics within [[Washington D.C.]] CQ has the largest news team covering [[Capitol Hill]], with more than 100 reporters, editors and researchers. CQ's readership includes 95 percent of the members of Congress, academic and media outlets, as well as members of business and [[nonprofit organization]]s, government affairs and the [[United States Government#Executive branch|executive branch]].

[[Thomas N. Schroth]], who had been managing editor of ''[[The Brooklyn Eagle]]'', was elected in October 1955 as executive editor and vice president.&lt;ref&gt;Via ''[[United Press International]]''. [https://www.nytimes.com/1955/10/30/archives/schroth-heads-quarterly.html "Schroth Heads Quarterly"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 30, 1955. Accessed August 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Schroth built the publication's impartial coverage, with annual revenue growing during his tenure from $150,000 when he started to $1.8 million. In addition to adding a book division, Schroth added many staff members who achieved future journalistic success, including [[David S. Broder]], Neal R. Peirce, and [[Elizabeth Drew]]. He was fired from ''Congressional Quarterly'' in 1969 after festering disagreements with Poynter over editorial policy at the publication and Schroth's efforts to advocate "more imaginative ways of doing things" reached a boil.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Bruce. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/us/05schroth.html "Thomas N. Schroth, Influential Washington Editor, Is Dead at 88"], ''The New York Times'', August 4, 2009. Accessed August 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Poynter summed up his reasons for founding CQ, saying: "The federal government will never set up an adequate agency to check on itself, and a foundation is too timid for that. So it had to be a private enterprise beholden to its clients"
.
Despite its name, CQ was published quarterly for only one year. Demand drove more frequent updates, first weekly, then daily. CQ was also an early leader in delivering information on a real-time basis, starting with a [[dial-up]] service in 1984. Its website dominates the market for online legislative tracking information and has been nominated for several awards. In recent years, CQ has launched several web-only newsletters with greater focus on particular areas, including CQ Homeland Security, CQ BudgetTracker, and "CQ HealthBeat".

In 2005, CQ's flagship publication, the ''Weekly Report'', was re-launched as ''CQ Weekly'' with a wider focus, including "government, commerce and politics." A daily publication, ''CQ Today'', also is available every day when Congress is in session. CQ Today's main print competition is Atlantic Media's CongressDaily.

Until 2009, CQ was owned by the [[Times Publishing Company]] of St. Petersburg, Fla., publisher of the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' (formerly the St. Petersburg Times) and other publications. The Times Publishing Company is in turn owned by the [[Poynter Institute]], a school for journalists founded by Nelson Poynter.  The Economist Group acquired CQ; the terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/22/congressional-quarterly-the-economist-group "The Economist Group Buys Congressional Quarterly"], July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Eight CQ reporters have won the "Everett McKinley Dirksen Award for Distinguished Reporting of Congress" from the [[National Press Foundation]]: [[Alan Ehrenhalt]] in 1983, Joan Biskupic in 1991, Janet Hook in 1992, George Hager in 1996, Jackie Koszczuk in 1997, Sue Kirchhoff in 2000, John Cochran in 2003, and Jonathan Allen in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nationalpress.org/info-url3520/info-url_show.htm?doc_id=118438 | title=Everett McKinley Dirksen Awards for Distinguished Reporting of Congress, Past Winners 1980-2008 | publisher=[[National Press Foundation]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127031453/http://www.nationalpress.org/info-url3520/info-url_show.htm?doc_id=118438 | archivedate=2009-01-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, CQ Executive Conferences was transferred to TheCapitol.Net, a non-partisan firm based in Alexandria, Virginia. TheCapitol.Net is no longer an affiliate of Congressional Quarterly.

In May 2008, ''[[CQ Press]]'' was purchased by ''[[SAGE Publications]]'' in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cqpress.com/docs/cqpress-sale-announcement.pdf |format=PDF| title=SAGE acquires CQ Press, Book-Publishing Unit of Congressional Quarterly Inc. | date= May 30, 2008| publisher=SAGE Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it retains the name "CQ Press" (a trademark of Congressional Quarterly), CQ Press is no longer an affiliate of Congressional Quarterly.

The '''''Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum''''' is a dictionary compiled by [[philologist]] [[John Kersey]], which was first published in London in 1708.

It was the third dictionary he had edited, after his 1702 ''[[A New English Dictionary]]'' and his 1706 revision of [[Edward Phillips]]' 1658 dictionary ''[[The New World of English Words]]''. The ''Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum'' is essentially an abridged version of this latter dictionary.

In '''''Ex Parte Douallier''''', an important case in [[South Africa|South African]] succession law, certain premises had been [[Bequest|bequeathed]] to the petitioner, and after her death to her eldest child, on the condition that she was not to mortgage or alienate the property. The petitioner was too poor to pay the costs of transfer or to repair the premises, which were fast becoming [[:wikt:unhabitable|uninhabitable]]. The eldest child was a minor.

The court, in the interest of the minor, and in order to prevent the bequest from failing altogether, granted leave to mortgage the premises for such sum as would be sufficient to enable the petitioner to obtain transfer and place the premises in a habitable state of repair, and directed that the interest should be paid by her during her life.

"'''Final Crisis'''" is a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline that appeared in comic books published by [[DC Comics]] in 2008, primarily the seven-issue [[miniseries]] of the same name written by [[Grant Morrison]]. Originally DC announced the project as being illustrated solely by [[J. G. Jones]]; artists [[Carlos Pacheco]], Marco Rudy and [[Doug Mahnke]] later provided art for the series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080616-PachecoFC.html Carlos Pacheco Joins JG Jones on Final Crisis], [[Newsarama]], June 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comixtreme.com/forums/showthread.php?t=45067 Review of ''Final Crisis'' #5], comiXtreme, December 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The storyline directly follows ''DC Universe'' #0 after the conclusion of the 51-issue ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' weekly limited series.&lt;ref name="CountdownPanel"&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/Comic-Con_07/DC/countdownpanel.html SDCC '07: DC's 'Countdown...To The End?'

The series deals with alien villain [[Darkseid]]'s plot to overthrow reality, and the subsequent death and corruption of various DC characters and their universe.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:FinalCrisis.jpg|left|thumb|''Final Crisis'' tease poster.]] --&gt;
''Final Crisis'' came out of several ideas Grant Morrison had when he returned to DC Comics in 2003. Morrison said, "I pitched a huge crossover event called Hypercrisis, which didn’t happen for various reasons. Some of Hypercrisis went into ''[[Seven Soldiers]]'', some went into ''[[All-Star Superman]]'', some went into ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' and some of it found a home in ''Final Crisis''."&lt;ref name=fcexit1&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/010928-Grant-Final-Crisis.html Grant Morrison: Final Crisis Exit Interview, Part 1], [[Newsarama]], January 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to Grant Morrison, work finally began on ''Final Crisis'' #1 in early [[2006 in comics|2006]], with the intention of the series being a thematic and literal sequel to ''Seven Soldiers'' and ''52'', two projects that Morrison was heavily involved in at the time.&lt;ref name=gmfc1&gt;[http://newsarama.com/comics/080609-MorrisonFC01.html Grant Morrison on Final Crisis #1], [[Newsarama]], June 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

References to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' as the "middle Crisis"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' #9: "[[The Lightning Saga]], Chapter Three", July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; gave readers the impression there would be at least one additional major follow-up to the original ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. A May 2007 teaser poster confirmed this speculation with the tagline: "Heroes die. Legends live forever."

''Final Crisis'' was preceded by ''Countdown'', a year-long  weekly series which was meant as a follow-up to ''52''. Halfway through, the series was renamed ''Countdown to Final Crisis''. However, the artwork met with delays.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} To keep the release on schedule, ''Countdown'' wrapped with issue #1 and its planned final issue (#0) was revamped as a 50 cent [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] special called ''DC Universe'' #0. Besides hyping upcoming storylines such as "[[Batman R.I.P.]]" and "[[Blackest Night]]," the issue was narrated by [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and featured [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] leading a group of super-villains in prayer for the "god of evil", [[Darkseid]]. The result is, as described by Morrison, that "we’re watching him fall back through the present, into the past of ''Seven Soldiers'' where he finally comes to rest in the body of 'Boss Dark Side’, the gangster from that story."&lt;ref name=gmfc1 /&gt;

To help readers identify events pertinent to ''Final Crisis'' and other major DCU events as the crossover approached, a "Sightings" cover banner appeared on various DC comics as "signposts, marking important storybeats and moments throughout the DC Universe."&lt;ref&gt;"DC Nation" #110&lt;/ref&gt; The first such headers appeared on ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #21 and ''Action Comics'' #866, respectively (the ''JLA'' issue featured Libra's return and his recruiting of the [[Human Flame]]).

The original intent was for [[J. G. Jones|Jones]] to pencil the whole series. Due to delays, however, [[Carlos Pacheco]] drew issues #4–6 with Jones, and issue 7 was drawn entirely by [[Doug Mahnke]]. Jones said that “Any problems completing the series are my own. I love Doug Mahnke’s art, and he would have probably been a better choice to draw this series in the first place.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=18513 |title=J.G. Jones Apologizes For Unfinished Final Crisis Work |last=Renaud |first=Jeffrey |date=2008-10-21 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the core limited series the larger storyline includes a number of [[#Tie-ins|tie-ins]], including one-shots and limited series.

The one-shots comprise "Requiem,"&lt;ref name=fcreq /&gt; "Resist,"&lt;ref name=fcresist /&gt; "Secret Files" and "Submit". Also "[[Red Lantern Corps|Rage of the Red Lanterns]]" is the start of a storyline of the same name, that picks up on events in "[[Green Lantern: Secret Origin]]" and continues in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #36–38. It starts as a tie-in because, according to writer [[Geoff Johns]], "events in ''Final Crisis'' have motivated the Guardians to proceed further with their attempted containment of the light".&lt;ref name=fcrage2 /&gt;

The limited series comprise ''Superman Beyond'' (a two issue mini-series also written by [[Grant Morrison]]), ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds|Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' (a five-issue limited series focusing on the different incarnations of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]&lt;ref name=fclegion /&gt;), ''[[Final Crisis: Revelations|Revelations]]'' (a five-issue limited series&lt;ref name=fcrev /&gt;), and ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge|Rogues' Revenge]]'' (a three-issue mini-series focused on the [[Rogues (comics)|Flash Rogues]]&lt;ref name=fcrr /&gt;).

==Plot==
Following the final battle of the [[New Gods]], the spirit of the lord of evil, [[Darkseid]], tumbles through time itself, coming to rest on [[Earth]], where it, along with the spirits of the other evil gods of [[Apokolips]], manifests itself in the body of a human being. Darkseid's "fall" has sundered reality, creating a [[black hole|singularity]] at the heart of creation, into which all of space and time are slowly being drawn, setting the stage for the evil god's final victory, to be claimed in his inevitable death. Through his agent [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]], he arranges for a [[Secret Society of Super Villains|huge army of super villains]] to be gathered, who capture and murder the [[Martian Manhunter]] as the opening salvo of the conflict. Coinciding with the Manhunter's death is the arrival on Earth of [[Nix Uotan]], an exiled member of the cosmic [[Monitor (comics)|Monitors]], who has been sentenced to become human as punishment for failure in his duties.

Following the trail of a group of missing child prodigies, detective [[Dan Turpin]] discovers the dying body of Darkseid's son, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]]. The [[Justice League of America]] liaise with the [[Green Lantern Corps]] to investigate the murder, deducing the cause of death to be a bullet of Radion—a substance toxic to New Gods—fired backwards through time from the future. New God [[Granny Goodness]], possessing the body of Green Lantern Kraken, stymies the investigation by framing [[Hal Jordan]] for the murder; when [[Batman]] deduces her true identity, she captures him and teleports him to [[Kamandi|Command D]], a government bio-chemical weapons facility beneath the city of [[Blüdhaven]] that has also fallen under the control of Darkseid's minions. Slowly becoming aware of the threat the evil gods pose, [[Alan Scott]] enacts "Article X", a super hero draft, that readies Earth's metahuman forces for the coming war.

With Batman and Jordan removed from play, the New Gods continue to eliminate the greatest threats to Darkseid's plan. [[Wonder Woman]] is infected by the Morticoccous bacteria by a [[Desaad]]-possessed [[Mary Marvel]] while investigating Blüdhaven. [[Superman]] departs for the future in order to obtain a cure for [[Lois Lane]] when a bomb in the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' building mortally wounds her. The Silver Age [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], is resurrected from within the [[Speed Force]] by [[Flash: Rebirth|powers unknown]], but then races back in time alongside [[Wally West]], attempting to outrun the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]], the Death of the New Gods, and stop the bullet that will kill Orion.

Turpin's search for the missing children leads him to the Dark Side Club, where he is confronted by Darkseid's human host, Boss Dark Side. The evil god transfers his essence into Turpin's body and brings him to Command D, where the detective is subjected to bio-genetic restructuring to transform his body into a replica of Darkseid's original form. Concurrently, Darkseid's agents release the [[Anti-Life Equation]] through all of Earth's communications networks, spreading it across the entire planet. The two Flashes, having failed to prevent Orion's death, emerge from the time stream one month after the equation's release, and discover that the minds of nearly the entire population have fallen under Darkseid's control, with its super-human victims having been transformed into a military force of "Justifiers".

With the help of the [[Tattooed Man]], the [[Super Young Team]] and former allies of the New Gods of [[New Genesis]] [[Shilo Norman]] and [[Sonny Sumo]], the small cells of super heroes who have managed to resist the equation discover a possible salvation: a symbol from the alphabet of the New Gods that will break the equation's control over minds, which was gifted to the cave-boy [[Anthro (comics)|Anthro]] by [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] in prehistoric times. Meanwhile, a huge battle erupts between the superheroes and the Justifiers in Blüdhaven, during which the equation-controlled Wonder Woman infects the heroes with Morticoccous, which strips the heroes of their powers. However, the loss of these troops is soon mitigated by the turning of Libra's Justifiers, control over whom is usurped by [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Doctor Sivana]] so they can help defeat Darkseid. These twists and turns are observed by Nix Uotan, whose powers and memories of his true nature are unlocked with the help of Metron and a mysterious ape-like figure in a robe.

Escaping confinement in Command D, Batman uses the radion bullet to mortally wound Darkseid, before the dark god uses his Omega Beams to kill Batman. Superman returns to the present and tears Command D apart to recover Batman's corpse, and faces off against Darkseid as the Flashes come racing into Blüdhaven, the Black Racer hot on their heels. As the heroes reach super-luminal velocity, time warps around the Flashes, creating the temporal eddy into which Darkseid fires the bullet, sending it back in time to kill Orion. Outpacing Omega Beams fired from the eyes of the humans in Darkseid's thrall, the Flashes lead both the beams and the Black Racer straight to Darkseid, finishing the job Batman had begun and bringing the touch of death to the god of evil. Simultaneously, [[Ray (comics)|The Ray]] traces the Metron symbol across the face of the Earth in beams of light, liberating all those under the equation's control; the freed Wonder Woman uses her lasso of truth to release Darkseid's consciousness from Turpin's body.

Although physically bested, Darkseid's dying essence is still dragging all of reality into nothingness along with it. Time and space break down as the effect worsens, until eventually, only Superman is left in the darkness at the end of creation, struggling to complete a copy of the "Miracle Machine," a wish-granting machine shown to him by [[Brainiac 5]] during his trip to the future. Darkseid's essence re-emerges to claim the machine, but Superman destroys him for good by using the last of his super-powered breath to sing, countering the vibrational frequency of Darkseid's life-force.

With Darkseid's end, however, the evil behind evils emerges: [[Monitors (comics)#Dax Novu/Mandrakk|Mandrakk]], the Dark Monitor, fallen father of Nix Uotan, who waits at the end of all things to consume what remains. Superman uses the solar energy in his own cells to power the Miracle Machine, and makes a wish that is granted by the appearance of an army of Supermen from all across the multiverse, including one modeled on [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="ObamaIsSuperman"&gt;{{cite news |first=Beverley |last=Lyons |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/2009/01/29/exclusive-comics-writer-grant-morrison-turns-barack-obama-into-superman-86908-21079550/ |title=Exclusive: Comics writer Grant Morrison turns Barack Obama into Superman |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)]] |date=January 29, 2009 |accessdate=March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nix Uotan joins the clash, using his Monitor powers to summon the Green Lantern Corps, the [[Zoo Crew]], the Super Young Team, the armies of Heaven itself, and more for a final battle with Mandrakk that culminates in the Corps spearing him with a stake made of pure light and created by the combined energy of their rings. The heroes drag Earth out of the black hole that is Darkseid, and Nix Uotan returns to being human as the other Monitors cease to exist in accordance with the wish Superman had made: a wish for a happy ending.

In the distant past, Anthro dies of old age in a cave. His body is discovered by Bruce Wayne — not dead, but sent back in time by the Omega Beams—who picks up where Anthro left off, drawing a bat symbol on the cave wall.

===Tie-ins===
Several one-shots and mini-series have been released as tie-ins to ''Final Crisis'':&lt;ref name=fcjohns&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=156412 Final Crisis: Secrets and Truths with Geoff Johns], [[Newsarama]], May 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; three series run in parallel to the main one and the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]], ''DC Universe: Last Will and Testament'', was planned to fit in the 'break' between ''Final Crisis'' #3 and #4.&lt;ref name=lastwill&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=16693 Meltzer Bridges Final Crisis with “Last Will and Testament”], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrison, who wrote one of the "final" Batman stories in "[[Batman R.I.P.]]," stated, "First it's ''R.I.P.'', and we'll see how that winds up for Batman. Then the two-parter mentioned (''Batman'' #682–683) goes through Batman's whole career, in a big summing up of everything that also ties directly into ''Final Crisis''. And ''Final Crisis'' is where we see the final fate of Batman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/902/902992p6.html |title=Killing Batman And The DC Universe |page=6 |last=Phillips |first=Dan |publisher=IGN |date=2008-08-26 |accessdate=2009-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not an official tie-in, the ''[[Terror Titans]]'' mini-series takes place during the events of ''Final Crisis'' and deals heavily with the Dark Side Club and the Anti-Life Equation.

{{lowercase title}}

The [[computer file]] '''hosts''' is an operating system file that maps [[hostname]]s to [[IP address]]es. It is a [[plain text]] file. Originally a file named HOSTS.TXT was manually maintained and made available via file sharing by [[Stanford Research Institute]] for the [[ARPANET]] membership, containing the hostnames and address of hosts as contributed for inclusion by member organizations. The [[Domain Name System]], first described in 1983 and implemented in 1984,&lt;ref name="BIND Home Page"&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/
|title = The Most Widely Used Name Server Software: BIND
|author= Internet Systems Consortium
|at = History of BIND
|accessdate=2017-07-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; automated the publication process and provided instantaneous and dynamic hostname resolution in the rapidly growing network. In modern operating systems, the hosts file remains an alternative name resolution mechanism, configurable often as part of facilities such as the [[Name Service Switch]] as either the primary method or as a fallback method.

==Purpose==
The hosts file is one of several system facilities that assists in addressing network nodes in a computer network. It is a common part of an operating system's [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) implementation, and serves the function of translating human-friendly hostnames into numeric protocol addresses, called [[IP address]]es, that identify and locate a host in an IP network.

In some operating systems, the contents of the hosts file is used preferentially to other name resolution methods, such as the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), but many systems implement [[name service]] switches, e.g., [[nsswitch.conf]] for [[Linux]] and [[Unix]], to provide customization. Unlike remote DNS resolvers, the hosts file is under the direct control of the local computer's administrator.&lt;ref&gt;"Cisco Networking Academy Program: First-Year Companion Guide", Cisco Systems, Inc., 2002 (2nd Edition), page 676, {{ISBN|1-58713-025-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==File content==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
The hosts file contains lines of text consisting of an [[IP address]] in the first text field followed by one or more host names. Each field is separated by white space&amp;nbsp;– tabs are often preferred for historical reasons, but spaces are also used. Comment lines may be included; they are indicated by an octothorpe (#) in the first position of such lines. Entirely blank lines in the file are ignored. For example, a typical hosts file may contain the following:
 127.0.0.1  localhost loopback
 ::1        localhost
This example only contains entries for the loopback addresses of the system and their host names, a typical default content of the hosts file. The example illustrates that an IP address may have multiple host names (''localhost'' and ''loopback''), and that a host name may be mapped to both [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] IP addresses, as shown on the first and second lines respectively.

==Location in the file system==
The location of the hosts file in the [[file system]] hierarchy varies by operating system. It is usually named ''hosts'', without an extension.

==History==
The [[ARPANET]], the predecessor of the [[Internet]], had no distributed host name database. Each network node maintained its own map of the network nodes as needed and assigned them names that were memorable to the users of the system. There was no method for ensuring that all references to a given node in a network were using the same name, nor was there a way to read the hosts file of another computer to automatically obtain a copy.

The small size of the ARPANET kept the administrative overhead small to maintain an accurate hosts file. Network nodes typically had one address and could have many names. As local area [[TCP/IP]] computer networks gained popularity, however, the maintenance of hosts files became a larger burden on system administrators as networks and network nodes were being added to the system with increasing frequency.

Standardization efforts, such as the format specification of the file ''HOSTS.TXT'' in RFC 952, and distribution protocols, e.g., the hostname server described in RFC 953, helped with these problems, but the centralized and monolithic nature of hosts files eventually necessitated the creation of the distributed [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).

On some old systems a file named [[Networks (file)|networks]] is present that has similar to hosts file functions containing names of networks.

==Extended applications==
In its function of resolving host names, the hosts file may be used to define any [[hostname]] or [[domain name]] for use in the local system.

;Redirecting local domains: Some web service and [[intranet]] developers and administrators define locally defined domains in a [[LAN]] for various purposes, such as accessing the company's internal resources or to test local websites in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Building / Testing via the Hosts File |url=https://web.osu.edu/technical-support/tips-tricks/hosts-file/ |website=Ohio State University Web Hosting |publisher=OCIO |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Internet resource blocking: Entries in the hosts file may be used to block [[online advertising]], or the domains of known malicious resources and servers that contain [[spyware]], [[adware]], and other [[malware]]. This may be achieved by adding entries for those sites to redirect requests to another address that does not exist or to a harmless destination such as the [[localhost|local machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=Gordon, -Tx |title=Gordon and -Tx explanations about the use of Gordon's hosts file |url=http://search.lores.eu/gorhost.htm |website=Web Searchlores |publisher=+Fravia |accessdate=5 August 2018 |ref=FraviaSearchLores}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commercial software applications may be used to populate the hosts file with entries of known undesirable Internet resources automatically.  In addition, user-created hosts files which block nuisance servers are publicly available.&lt;ref name=ConstanGit&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hofstetter |first1=Constantin |title=/etc/hosts to block shock sites etc. |url=https://gist.github.com/consti/8022703 |website=Github |accessdate=5 August 2018 |ref=ConstanGit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FraviaAntiAdvert&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vianello |first1=Francesco "Fravia" |title=Antiadvertisement Lab |url=http://search.lores.eu/antiadve.htm |website=Web Searchlores |publisher=+Fravia |accessdate=5 August 2018 |ref=FraviaAntiAdvert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Fravia]] described these files variously as "scrolls", "precious", and "powerful" in his anti-advertisement pages, where this usage of hosts was first published.&lt;ref name=FraviaAntiAdvert /&gt;

;Software piracy: Some [[Software piracy|pirated versions of software]] rely on a modified hosts file to prevent software from contacting the activation servers of the publisher, although activation servers sometimes appear in general purpose hosts files.&lt;ref name=ConstanGit /&gt;

==Security issues==
The hosts file may present an attack vector for malicious software. The file may be modified, for example, by [[adware]], [[computer virus]]es, or [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] software to redirect traffic from the intended destination to sites hosting malicious or unwanted content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2003-100116-5901-99&amp;tabid=1 |title=Remove Trojan.Qhosts&amp;nbsp;– Symantec |accessdate=May 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The widespread [[computer worm]] [[Mydoom.B]] blocked users from visiting sites about [[computer security]] and [[antivirus software]] and also affected access from the compromised computer to the Microsoft [[Windows Update]] website.
In some cases malware has modified the library responsible for loading the hosts file in order to redirect it to a file it is able to control freely.&lt;ref name="MWBHosts"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Arntz |first1=Pieter |title=Hosts file hijacks |url=https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2016/09/hosts-file-hijacks/ |website=Malwarebytes Labs |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2487">An '''immigration tariff''' is a [[Duty (economics)|charge levied]] on [[immigrants]] wanting [[permanent residency]] within a nation. As a means of applying [[price theory]] to a nation's [[immigration policy]], it is generally advocated as an alternative to existing [[Regulations|bureaucratic procedures]] as a means of moderating or better regulating the flow of immigration to a given level. 

The idea is frequently associated with American [[economist]] [[Gary Becker]], who stated, "When I mention this to people, they sometimes go hysterical." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/news/2007-04-02_Becker-bb.aspx|title = Gary Beck on immigration tariffs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alex Nowrasteh]], an immigration policy analyst, wrote a policy analysis arguing for immigration tariffs for the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cei.org/onpoint/conservative-case-immigration-tariffs|title = The Conservative Case for Immigration Tariffs|last = Nowrasteh|first = Alex|publisher = ''[[Competitive Enterprise Institute]]''|date = 2012-02-07|accessdate = 2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015 the Australian government launched an inquiry into the use of an immigration tariff as an alternative to existing immigration arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/migrant-intake#report|title=Migrant Intake Into Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Productivity Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the [[subdistricts of Indonesia|subdistrict]] in [[Tuban Regency]], [[East Java]], [[Indonesia]]|Jenu (subdistrict)}}
In [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] [[folklore]], a '''Jenu''' is a wild and [[cannibal]]istic hairy giant.

In [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959]] he was the unsuccessful [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate for [[Bristol Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol Central]].

He was managing editor of a British hunting magazine, ''[[Shooting Times]]'', from 1960 to 1964.{{ref|Times1}} He later authored an important book highly critical of [[sport hunting]], ''After Their Blood'', in which he wrote: "It is our duty as men and women of God’s redeemed creation to try not to increase the suffering of the world, but to lessen it. To get rid of bloodsports will be a great step toward this end."

In 1948 Leslie Pine married Grace V. Griffin (20 August 1914- ). Their only child, [[Richard Pine]], was born in London on 21 August 1949.

==Circulation and services==

Library cards are free to California residents.  Circulating books, zines, periodicals, computer access and audiovisual materials are available to patrons. Books, magazines, and audiobooks are loaned for 3 weeks. Music cassettes, music CDs, documentary videos, and documentary DVDs are loaned for 1 week. Entertainment videos and entertainment DVDs are loaned for 4 days. Fines are charged only if materials are returned late. There is a loan limit of 10 books, 10 magazines, and 4 DVDs or videos at one time up to maximum of 30 items on the patron's record. Items checked out from Los Angeles Public Library may be returned to any of its 72 branches or to the Central Library. Most items may be renewed a maximum of two times. Entertainment DVDs and videos may be renewed one time.

The Los Angeles Public Library has many community support organizations which work with the library to raise funds and sponsor programs to enhance library service throughout the community. The Library's Rare Books Department is located in its downtown Los Angeles location.  There is also an extensive selection of databases covering a wide variety of topics, many of which are available to remote users who hold an LAPL library card. Examples include full-text databases of periodicals, business directories, and language learning tools.  The Central Library at 630 West 5th Street, between Grand Avenue and Flower Street in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], remains an important research library, despite the development of accessible databases and public access to the Internet.

The Los Angeles Library Association was formed in late 1872, and by early 1873, a well-stocked reading room had opened under the first librarian, John Littlefield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The light of learning: an illustrated history of the Los Angeles Public Library|last=Soter|first=Bernadette Dominique|publisher=Library Foundation of Los Angeles|year=1993|isbn=|location=Los Angeles|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aggressive expansion and growth of the system began in the 1920s. Under Library Board of Commissioners Chairman [[Orra E. Monnette]], the system was improved with a large network of branch libraries with new buildings. Thelma Jackman founded the Business &amp; Economics section of the library sometime prior to 1970.

==Central Library==

[[Image:LA Library.jpg|right|thumb|Los Angeles Central Library at Flower Street]]
The historic Central Library Goodhue building was constructed in 1926 and is a [[Downtown Los Angeles]] landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lapl.org/branches/central-library/art-architecture/goodhue-building|title=EARLY HISTORY, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE GOODHUE BUILDING {{!}} Los Angeles Public Library|website=www.lapl.org|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Library was designed by the architect, Bertram Goodhue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Orlean |first1=Susan |title=The Library Book |date=2018 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4767-4018-8 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Richard Riordan Central Library complex is the third largest public library in the United States in terms of book and periodical holdings. Originally named the Central Library, the building was first renamed in honor of the longtime president of the Board of Library Commissioners and President of the [[University of Southern California]], [[Rufus B. von KleinSmid]].  The new wing of Central Library, completed in 1993, was named in honor of former mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lapl.org/branches/central-library/art-architecture/tom-bradley-wing|title=TOM BRADLEY WING: HISTORY AND DESIGN {{!}} Los Angeles Public Library|website=www.lapl.org|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The complex (i.e., the original Goodhue building and the Bradley wing) was subsequently renamed in 2001 for former Los Angeles Mayor [[Richard Riordan]], as the Richard Riordan Central Library.

===Awards===
The Los Angeles Public Library received the [[National Medal for Museum and Library Service]], the nation's highest honor given to museums and libraries for service to the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-public-library-wins-top-award-20150422-story.html|title=Los Angeles Public Library wins top award for cultural institutions|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; City Librarian John F. Szabo and community member Sergio Sanchez accepted the award on behalf of the library from First Lady Michelle Obama during a White House Ceremony on May 20, 2015.

The Los Angeles Public Library was selected for its success in meeting the needs of Angelenos and providing a level of social, educational, and cultural services unmatched by any other public institution in the city. The award recognizes the library's programs that help people on their path to citizenship, earn their high school diploma, manage personal finances and access health and well-being services and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Medal for Museum and Library Service  {{!}} Los Angeles Public Library|url = http://www.lapl.org/NationalMedal|website = www.lapl.org|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[Image:Mural LA Central Library.jpg|right|thumb|A portion of the four-part mural by illustrator Dean Cornwell depicted the stages of the history of California at the Los Angeles Central Library.]]
Architect [[Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue]] designed the original Los Angeles Central Library with influences of [[ancient Egypt]]ian and [[Mediterranean Revival architecture]]. The central tower is topped with a tiled [[mosaic]] [[pyramid]] with suns on the sides with a hand holding a torch representing the "Light of Learning" at the apex. Other elements include [[sphinx]]es, [[snake]]s, and celestial mosaics. It has sculptural elements by the preeminent American architectural sculptor [[Lee Lawrie]], similar to the [[Nebraska State Capitol]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], also designed by Goodhue. The interior of the library is decorated with various figures, statues, chandeliers, and grilles, notably a four-part [[mural]] by illustrator [[Dean Cornwell]] depicting stages of the [[History of California]] which was completed around 1933.&lt;ref name="KCET"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/landofsunshine/writing-on-the-wall/central-library-murals-are-also-80-years-old.html|title=Central Library Murals Are Also 80 Years Old|first=Ed|last=Fuentes|publisher=KCET|accessdate=May 10, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521163134/http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/landofsunshine/writing-on-the-wall/central-library-murals-are-also-80-years-old.html|archivedate=May 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is a designated [[Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument]], and is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

===Expansion===
The Central Library was extensively renovated and expanded in a [[Modernist]]/[[Beaux-Arts architecture]], according to Norman Pfeiffer, the principal architect of the renovation by [[Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates]] from 1988 through 1993. It included an enormous, eight-story atrium wing dedicated to former mayor Tom Bradley. Now, the library contains an area of {{convert|538000|sqft|m2}}, and has nearly 89 miles of shelves and seating for over 1,400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Central Library|url=http://www.lapl.org/about-lapl/press/central-facts|website=Los Angeles Public Library|publisher=Los Angeles Public Library|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Access needs====
The building's limited access had caused a number of problems.  Generally, the accessible public stacks in the reading rooms only displayed about 10 to 20 percent of the actual collections of the Central Library.  For anything else, a patron had to submit a request slip and a clerk would retrieve the desired material from the internal stacks.  Internal stacks were packed very tightly and had very little headroom.  For example, while the normal reading rooms had ceilings of anywhere from ten to fifteen feet, the internal stack areas were many shelves of about six-foot height, stacked internally, so that while the public access area was about two floors plus the Science and Technology alcove, the internal stacks were approximately five or six floors.  To fix this would have required substantial renovation, a cost the city was not willing to cover, especially after hours of operation were cut in response to the 1978 property tax reduction measure [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]].

;Arson catalyst
[[File:Plaque honoring those fighting the Los Angeles Public Library fire of 1986.jpg|thumb|Plaque honoring those fighting the arson fire of 1986]]
The catalyst for the renovation was a devastating [[arson]] [[structure fire|fire]] on April 29, 1986. Although the building was safely evacuated, its vintage construction precluded the ventilation of heat and smoke, and limited [[firefighter]] access.  It took firefighters over seven hours to extinguish the fire and little fires would continue to sprout up for several days after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Orlean |first1=Susan |title=The Library Book |date=2018 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4767-4018-8 |page=31,34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 400,000 volumes&amp;mdash;20 percent of the library's holdings&amp;mdash;were destroyed, with significant water and smoke damage done to the surviving works, of which 700,000 were damaged by water or smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Orlean |first1=Susan |title=The Library Book |date=2018 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-104767-4018-8 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=PBS NewsHour|title=Why a library fire feels like an 'attack on humanity'|date=2018-11-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maMYa1trDsc|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The estimated cost for replacing the 400,000 works lost was over $14 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Orlean |first1=Susan |title=The Library Book |date=2018 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4767-4018-8 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second fire, on September 3 of the same year, destroyed the contents of the music department reading room.

====Project====
As part of the rehabilitation plan, LAPL sold its [[air rights]] to developers, enabling the construction of the eponymous [[U.S. Bank Tower (Los Angeles)|Library Tower]] across the street. The [[skyscraper]] was subsequently renamed the First Interstate World Center and later the U.S. Bank Tower.&lt;ref name=Myers1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-21/realestate/re-8747_1_library-tower|title=L.A. Tower to Be Tallest on Coast : Ground Breaking Due Tuesday for 73-Story Downtown Building|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 21, 1987|first=David W. |last=Myers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional funds were raised through corporate and personal contributions which flowed from the effort of the "Save The Books" campaign formed by Mayor Tom Bradley.

The campaign, co-chaired by [[Lodwrick Cook]], then CEO of [[ARCO|Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO)]] had targeted a goal to raise $10 million through corporate and individual contributions ranging from schoolchildren's nickels and dimes to $50,000 contributions by Los Angeles businessman [[Marvin Davis]] and MCA Chairman [[Lew Wasserman]].   [[Gene Scott|William Eugene "Gene" Scott]], an LAPL neighbor and member of the 43 strong blue ribbon committee, donated the use of his University Network television studios and himself to what became a 48-hour telethon to raise $2 million towards the total objective.

The Library's renovation was completed in 1993. It included a large new underground parking facility, with a park designed by [[Lawrence Halprin]] over it. The Central Library reopened on October 3, 1993.

===Los Angeles Public Library Photo Collection===
The Central Library houses and archives the extensive Los Angeles Public Library Photo Collection of over 3 million historic photographs from varied sources and collection acquisitions. Many images can be viewed by the public via the online photo collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title='Photograph Collection Overview' (online photos) | url=http://www.lapl.org/catalog/photo_collection_overview.html | publisher=Los Angeles Public Library | year=2011 | accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Los_Angeles_Public_Library_Photo_Collection Wikimedia Commons — Category: Los Angeles Public Library Photo Collection]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} — Wikimedia category for images from the LAPL Photo Collection.&lt;/ref&gt; The physical Photo Collection is an important resource for researchers, writers, curators, and educators.&lt;ref name="bancroft"&gt;[http://bancroft.library.ca.gov/diglib/shadescalif.cfm Bancroft Library — Shades of California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808112821/http://bancroft.library.ca.gov/diglib/shadescalif.cfm |date=August 8, 2011 }} . accessed March 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shades of L.A.====
The "Shades of L.A. Collection" is an [[archive]] of more than 10,000 images donated/duplicated from family photo albums (collected by former Photo Collection director Carolyn Kozo Cole) that expanded the archives to include the many diverse ethnic histories of people in the city, beyond the already well represented 'Anglo' population.

The project's success expanded to the [[California State Library]] creating the "Shades of California" collection to represent the state's diverse communities, using the LAPL methods and model.&lt;ref name="bancroft"/&gt;  The book "Shades of California: The Hidden Beauty of Ordinary Life" resulted from the successful statewide project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://heydaybooks.com/book/shades-of-california-the-hidde/ "Shades of California: The Hidden Beauty of Ordinary Life"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; Edited by Kimi Kodani Hill; Heyday Books; {{ISBN|978-1-890771-44-7}} ; accessed March 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Over a dozen California city and county library districts also created local Shades of California collections, such as [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], and [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bancroft.library.ca.gov/diglib/shadescalif.cfm Bancroft Library — Shades of California city and county collections links] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808112821/http://bancroft.library.ca.gov/diglib/shadescalif.cfm |date=August 8, 2011 }} (bottom of webpage) . accessed March 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feathers map collection===
In 2012 Glen Creason, the map librarian for the central library, was invited to the [[Mount Washington, Los Angeles|Mount Washington]] home of John Feathers, who had died at age 56 with no known relatives. According to Creason, the cottage contained "at least a million maps" and the library was delighted to accept their donation. "This dwarfs our collection", he said, "and we've been collecting for 100 years."
The maps were stored on shelves, in boxes, in file cabinets, and even in the cabinet of an old [[music centre|stereo system]] with its electronics removed.

Creason said it could take a year to [[library catalog|catalog]] and organize the maps and {{convert|sigfig=2|abbr=out|600|ft|m}} of shelving would be needed, but the library would then have the fifth-largest map collection in the country.&lt;ref name="Dumpster"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/19/local/la-me-map-house-20121019|title=Saved from Dumpster: Amazing map collection makes librarians tingle|date=October 19, 2012|first= Bob |last=Pool |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5430">A '''manifest''', '''customs manifest''' or '''cargo document''' is a [[document]] listing the [[cargo]], [[passenger]]s, and [[crew]] of a [[ship]], [[aircraft]], or [[vehicle]], for the use of [[customs]] and other officials. Where such a list is limited to identifying passengers, it is a '''passenger manifest''' or '''passenger list'''; conversely, a list limited to identifying cargo is a '''cargo manifest''' or '''cargo list'''. The manifest may be used by people having an interest in the transport to ensure that passengers and cargo listed as having been placed on board the transport at the beginning of its passage continue to be on board when it arrives at its destination.&lt;blockquote&gt;This document, made up generally by the ship's broker, from the contents of the [[Bill of lading|bills of lading]], contains a specification of the nature and quantity of the cargo laden, and is generally attested officially, and in some countries notarially. The [[Prize (law)|prize laws]] seldom mention this paper ; nor is it general ; but yet of essential importance in case of search, as well for belligerents, as for neutrals in procuring a speedy dismissal. It is usual to require it at the [[Customs|custom]] house.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=fIUuAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=%22passport+bill+of+lading%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hhnjnpF6Zb&amp;sig=4xgrojj4cR-w9wx_qnTQK8OqrJI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBrZH2-4naAhUBQBQKHd1xCB8Q6AEIODAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22passport%20bill%20of%20lading%22&amp;f=false|title=Laws of the Sea: With Reference to Maritime Commerce During Peace and War|last=Jacobsen|first=Friedrich Johann|date=1818|publisher=Edward J. Coale.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this way, a cargo manifest is like a [[passport]] except that it is used for [[goods]] instead of (or in addition to) [[Person|persons]]; the manifest is evidence to the [[nationality]] of the goods, the absence of [[contraband]], and that property belonging to [[Belligerent|belligerents]] is not laden on board of the vessel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Vessels are under no legal obligation to carry a manifest and, indeed, it is only necessary for neutral vessels in a time of war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cargo manifest vs. bill of lading ==
A cargo manifest and a [[bill of lading]] may carry similar information and the concepts are not always clearly distinguished. In some cases, a single document may serve both purposes. In general, a bill of lading serves as a [[legal instrument]] focusing on and documenting such issues as [[ownership]], whereas a cargo manifest is often more concerned with physical aspects of the cargo, such as [[weight]] and [[size]]. When the cargo is being shipped by several different shipping companies on the same vessel, there will usually be separate bills of lading for each company, but only a single consolidated cargo manifest. On the other hand, if the cargo contains [[dangerous goods]], there may be a separate dangerous cargo manifest. 
 
==Uses==
===Customs and excise===
[[Customs|Customs authorities]] may require cargo-carrying vessels or vehicles to provide information on the cargo manifest such as its consignor, consignee, quantity of goods, origin, destination and value.&lt;ref name=BusinessDictionary&gt;Business Dictionary.com, "[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/manifest.html Manifest]", retrieved 23 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===International travel===
Immigration authorities may require passenger-carrying vessels or vehicles to provide a passenger manifest listing information such as names and ports of embarkation and disembarkation.&lt;ref name=BusinessDictionary/&gt;

===Disasters===
In case of [[disaster]]s, passenger manifests may be helpful in identifying casualties and notifying families of passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Code of Federal Regulations]] |chapter-url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/243.1 |chapter=14 CFR Part 243 - Passenger Manifest Information, §243.1 Purpose }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 13, 1997 |title=Domestic Passenger Manifest Information – Advance notice of proposed rulemaking |url=https://www.epic.org/privacy/faa/passenger_manifest_397.html |journal=Federal Register |volume=62 |number=49 |access-date=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cargo manifests can support [[insurance claim]]s for lost goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Customer Support – Marine Cargo Claims / Documents Required |author= |url=http://www.ecics.com.sg/customer-support.html |publisher=[[List of insurance companies in Singapore|ECICS Limited]] |date=2014 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
Manifests can be useful tools for [[archaeology]]. For example, researchers used old ship's manifests to recreate the available amenities in their restoration of the historic [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|Custom House Plaza]] in [[Monterey, California]],&lt;ref&gt;Maxine Cass, ''Northern California Off the Beaten Path, 8th: A Guide to Unique Places'' (2009), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; which was built in 1821 and remains the oldest public building in [[California]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1106">A '''multi-source agreement''' ('''MSA''') is an agreement between multiple [[manufacturer]]s to make products which are compatible across vendors, acting as [[de facto standard]]s, establishing a competitive market for interoperable products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commscope.com/Resources/Standards/Enterprise/Multi-source-agreements/|title=Multi-source agreements|publisher=Commscope|accessdate=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Products that adhere to multi-source agreements (MSAs) include: optical transceivers, such as the [[Small form-factor pluggable transceiver|SFP]], SFP+, [[XENPAK]], [[QSFP]], [[XFP transceiver|XFP]], [[C Form-factor Pluggable|CFP]] etc.; fiber optic cables; and other networking devices. MSAs strictly define the operating characteristics of these network devices so that system vendors may implement ports in their devices (e.g. Ethernet switches and routers) that allow MSA compliant devices produced by name brand, as well a third party vendors, to function properly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10956">A '''name server''' is a computer application that implements a [[network service]] for providing responses to queries against a [[directory service]]. It translates an often humanly meaningful, text-based identifier to a system-internal, often numeric identification or addressing component. This service is performed by the server in response to a [[protocol (computing)|service protocol]] request.

An example of a name server is the server component of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), one of the two principal [[namespace]]s of the [[Internet]]. The most important function of DNS servers is the translation (resolution) of human-memorable [[domain name]]s and [[hostname]]s into the corresponding numeric [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) addresses, the second principal name space of the Internet which is used to identify and locate computer systems and resources on the Internet.

==Domain Name Server==
{{main|Domain Name System}}
The Internet maintains two principal [[namespace]]s: the domain name hierarchy&lt;ref name="rfc1034"&gt;RFC 1034, ''Domain Names—Concepts and Facilities'', P. Mockapetris, The Internet Society (November 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and the IP address system.&lt;ref name="rfc781"&gt;RFC 781, ''Internet Protocol—DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification'', Information Sciences Institute, J. Postel (Ed.), The Internet Society (September 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; The Domain Name System maintains the domain namespace and provides translation services between these two namespaces. Internet name servers implement the Domain Name System.&lt;ref name="rfc1035"&gt;RFC 1035, ''Domain Names&amp;nbsp;— Implementation and Specification'', P. Mockapetris, The Internet Society (November 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; The top hierarchy of the Domain Name System is served by the [[Root nameserver|root name servers]] maintained by delegation by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). Below the root, Internet resources are organized into a hierarchy of domains, administered by the respective registrars and domain name holders.
A DNS name server is a server that stores the [[DNS record]]s, such as address (A, AAAA) records, name server (NS) records, and mail exchanger (MX) records for a domain name (see also [[List of DNS record types]]) and responds with answers to queries against its database.

===Authoritative name server===
An authoritative name server is a name server that gives [[#Authoritative answer|answers]] in response to questions asked about names in a [[DNS zone|zone]]. An authoritative-only name server returns answers only to queries about domain names that have been specifically configured by the administrator. Name servers can also be configured to give authoritative answers to queries in some zones, while acting as a [[#Caching name server|caching name server]] for all other zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=DNS Terminology |rfc=7719 |author1=Paul Hoffman |author2=Andrew Sullivan |author3=Kazunori Fujiwara |year=2015 |month=December |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=17 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An authoritative name server can either be a ''primary'' server (master) or a ''secondary'' server (slave). A primary server for a zone is the server that stores the definitive versions of all records in that zone.  It is identified by start-of-authority (SOA) resource record.  A secondary server for a zone uses an automatic updating mechanism to maintain an identical copy of the primary server's database for a zone. Examples of such mechanisms include [[DNS zone transfer]]s and file transfer protocols. DNS provides a mechanism whereby the primary for a zone can notify all the known secondaries for that zone when the contents of the zone have changed. The contents of a zone are either manually configured by an administrator, or managed using [[Dynamic DNS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Dynamic Updates in the Domain Name System (DNS UPDATE) |rfc=2136 |author1=Yakov Rekhter |author2=Susan Thomson |author3=Jim Bound |author4=Paul Vixie |year=1007 |month=April |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=17 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every domain name appears in a zone served by one or more authoritative name servers. The [[fully qualified domain name]]s of the authoritative name servers of a zone are listed in the NS records of that zone. If the server for a zone is not also authoritative for its parent zone, the server for the parent zone must be configured with a [[glue record|delegation]] for the zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Clarifications to the DNS Specification |rfc=2181 |author1=Robert Elz |author2=Randy Bush |year=1997 |month=July |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=17 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a domain is registered with a [[domain name registrar]], the zone administrator provides the list of name servers (typically at least two, for redundancy&lt;ref name="techterms"&gt;{{cite web|title=Name Server definition at techterms.com|url=http://www.techterms.com/definition/nameserver}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that are authoritative for the zone that contains the domain. The registrar provides the names of these servers to the [[domain registry]] for the [[top level domain]] containing the zone. The domain registry in turn configures the authoritative name servers for that top level domain with delegations for each server for the zone. If the fully qualified domain name of any name server for a zone appears within that zone, the zone administrator provides IP addresses for that name server, which are installed in the parent zone as [[glue records]]; otherwise, the delegation consists of the list of NS records for that zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Domain Names - Domain Concepts and Facilities |rfc=1034 |sectionname=Technical considerations |section=4.2.1 |author1=Paul Mockapetris |year=1987 |month=November |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=17 December 2015 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authoritative answer===&lt;!-- 'Authoritative Answer' redirects here --&gt;
A name server indicates that its response is authoritative by setting the ''Authoritative Answer'' (''AA'') bit in the response to a query on a name for which it is authoritative. Name servers providing answers for which they are not authoritative (for example, name servers for parent zones) do not set the ''AA'' bit.&lt;ref name="rfc1035"/&gt;

===Recursive query===
If a name server cannot answer a query because it does not contain an entry for the host in its DNS cache, it may recursively query name servers higher up in the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=pub1sc23881400|title=Composite Application Manager for Internet Service Monitoring, Reference Guide | publisher = IBM | accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;This is known as a ''recursive query'' or ''recursive lookup''. A server providing recursive queries is known as a ''recursive name server'' or ''recursive DNS'', sometimes abbreviated as '''recdns'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fanf.livejournal.com/133020.html|title=Network setup for Cambridge's new DNS servers|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-05|quote=The recursive DNS server (aka recdns)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, authoritative name servers suffice for the operation of the Internet. However, with only authoritative name-servers operating, every DNS query must start with recursive queries at the [[DNS root zone|root zone]] of the Domain Name System and each user system must implement resolver software capable of recursive operation.{{clarify|date=May 2016}}

===Caching name server===
Caching name servers (''DNS caches'') store DNS query results for a period of time determined in the configuration (time-to-live) of each domain-name record. DNS caches improve the efficiency of the DNS by reducing DNS traffic across the Internet, and by reducing load on authoritative name-servers, particularly root name-servers. Because they can answer questions more quickly, they also increase the performance of end-user applications that use the DNS.
''Recursive name servers'' resolve any query they receive, even if they are not authoritative for the question being asked, by consulting the server or servers that are authoritative for the question.
Caching name servers are often also recursive name servers—they perform every step necessary to answer any DNS query they receive. To do this the name server queries each authoritative name-server in turn, starting from the DNS root zone. It continues until it reaches the authoritative server for the zone that contains the queried domain name. That server provides the answer to the question, or definitively says it can't be answered, and the ''caching resolver'' then returns this response to the client that asked the question.
The authority, resolving and caching functions can all be present in a DNS server implementation, but this is not required: a DNS server can implement any one of these functions alone, without implementing the others.
[[Internet service providers]] typically provide caching resolvers for their customers. In addition, many [[home networking|home-networking]] routers implement caching resolvers to improve efficiency in the local network.
Some systems utilize &lt;code&gt;nscd&lt;/code&gt; - the name service caching daemon&lt;ref&gt;, though this is typically not used for caching DNS names.

'''Pan-Turkism''' is a movement which emerged during the 1880s among Turkic intellectuals of [[Azerbaijan]] (part of the [[Russian Empire]] at the time) and the [[Ottoman Empire]] (modern day [[Turkey]]), with its aim being the cultural and political unification of all [[Turkic peoples]].&lt;ref name="fishman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Language and Ethnic Identity: The Success-Failure Continuum in Language and Ethnic Identity Efforts|last=Fishman|first=Joshua |authorlink=|author2=Garcia, Ofelia|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=2|location=|isbn=978-0-19-539245-6|page=269|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUydX_3rG0AC&amp;pg=PA269|quote=''It is commonly acknowledged that pan-Turkism, the movement aiming at the political and/or cultural unification of all Turkic peoples, emerged among Turkic intellectuals of Russia as a liberal-cultural movement in the 1880s.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|title=Pan-Turkism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/440700/Pan-Turkism|accessdate=19 Jul 2009|year=2009|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|volume=|location=|id=|isbn=|oclc=|doi=|pages=|quote=Political movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which had as its goal the political union of all Turkish-speaking peoples in the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Iran]], and [[Afghanistan]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="landau"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Landau|first=Jacob|year=1995|title=Pan-Turkism: From Irredentism To Cooperation|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20960-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uy6Sa0E3HbcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LandauRadicalPolitics"&gt;Jacob M.

However, researchers and politicians steeped in Turkic ideology have used these terms interchangeably in many sources and works of literature.&lt;ref name="Gilyazov"&gt;Iskander Gilyazov, "[http://beznen-yul.narod.ru/by-kyzyk/panturk.htm Пантюрκизм, Пантуранизм и Германия] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004230533/http://beznen-yul.narod.ru/by-kyzyk/panturk.htm |date=2006-10-04 }}", magazine "Татарстан" No 5-6, 1995. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Turkic peoples share historical, cultural and linguistic roots, the rise of a pan-Turkic political movement is a phenomenon of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9058213/Pan-Turkism|title=Pan-Turkism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in part a response to the development of [[Pan-Slavism]] and [[Pan-Germanism]] in [[Europe]], and influenced [[Pan-Iranism]] in [[Asia]].

==Name==
In research literature, "pan-Turkism" is used to describe the political, cultural and ethnic unity of all [[Turkic languages|Turkic-speaking]] people. "Turkism" began to be used with the prefix "pan-" (from the Greek πᾶν, pan = all).&lt;ref&gt;Mansur Hasanov, Academician of Academy of Sciences of Tatarstan Republic, "[http://www.rt-online.ru/numbers/public/?ID=25970 Великий реформатор]", in magazine "Республика Татарстан" № 96–97 (24393-24394), 17 May 2001. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents use the latter as a point of comparison, since "Turkic" is more a linguistic and cultural distinction than a racial or ethnic description. This differentiates it from "Turkish", which is an ethnic term for people primarily residing in Turkey. Pan-Turkic ideas and reunification movements have been popular since the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in Central Asian and other [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] countries.

==History==
[[Image:PanTurkishRally.JPG|thumb|alt=Demonstration with flags|Pan-Turkic rally in Istanbul, March 2009]]
In 1804, the [[Tatars|Tatar]] theologian [[Ghabdennasir Qursawi]] wrote a [[treatise]] calling for the modernization of Islam. Qursawi was a [[Jadid]] (from the Arabic ''jadid'', "new"). The Jadids encouraged critical thinking, supporting education and the equality of the sexes, and advocated tolerance for other faiths, Turkic cultural unity, and openness to Europe’s cultural legacy.&lt;ref name="Khakimov"&gt;Rafael Khakimov, "[http://eng.globalaffairs.ru/region-ecology/numbers/5/504.html Taklid and Ijtihad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210221350/http://eng.globalaffairs.ru/region-ecology/numbers/5/504.html |date=2007-02-10 }}", ''Russia in Global Affairs'', Dec. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jadid movement was founded in 1843 in [[Kazan]]. Its aim was a semi-secular modernization and educational reform, with a national (not religious) identity for the Turks. Before that they were [[Muslim]] subjects of the Russian Empire, which maintained this attitude until its end.&lt;ref name="NN"&gt;N.N., "[http://www.panorama.ru/gazeta/p35_turk.html Полтора Века Пантюрκизма в Турции]", magazine "Панорама". {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Wäisi movement]], the Jadids advocated national liberation. After 1907, many supporters of Turkic unity immigrated to the Ottoman Empire.

The newspaper ''Türk'' in Cairo was published by exiles from the Ottoman Empire after the suspension of the 1876 constitution and the persecution of liberal intellectuals. It was the first publication to use the ethnic designation as its title.&lt;ref name="Modernism: The Creation of Nation States" /&gt; [[Yusuf Akçura]] published "Three Types of Policy" (''Üç tarz-ı siyaset'') anonymously in 1904, the earliest manifesto of a pan-Turkic nationalism.&lt;ref name="Modernism: The Creation of Nation States" /&gt; Akçura argued that the supra-ethnic union espoused by the Ottomans was unrealistic. The Pan-Islamic model had advantages, but Muslim populations were under colonial rule which would oppose unification. He concluded that an ethnic Turkish nation would require the cultivation of a national identity; a pan-Turkish empire would abandon the Balkans and Eastern Europe in favor of Central Asia. The first publication of "Three Types of Policy" had a negative reaction, but it became more influential by its third publication in 1911 in Istanbul. The Ottoman Empire had lost its African territory to [[Italy]] and it would soon lose the Balkans, and pan-Turkish nationalism became a more feasible (and popular) political strategy.

In 1908 the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] came to power in Ottoman Turkey, and the empire adopted a nationalistic ideology. This contrasted with its largely Muslim ideology dating back to the 16th century, when the sultan was a [[Ottoman Caliphate|caliph]] of his Muslim lands. Leaders espousing Pan-Turkism fled from Russia to [[Istanbul]], where a strong pan-Turkic movement arose; the Turkish pan-Turkic movement grew into a nationalistic, ethnically oriented replacement of the [[caliphate]] with a state. After the [[fall of the Ottoman Empire]] with its multi-cultural and multi-ethnic population, influenced by the nationalism of the [[Young Turks]], some tried to replace the empire with a Turkish commonwealth. Leaders like [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] acknowledged that such a goal was impossible, replacing pan-Turkic idealism with a nationalism aimed at preserving an [[Anatolia]]n nucleus.

The ''Türk Yurdu Dergisi'' (''Journal of the Turkish Homeland'') was founded in 1911 by Akçura. This was the most important Turkist publication of the time, "in which, along with other Turkic exiles from Russia, [Akçura] attempted to instill a consciousness about the cultural unity of all Turkic peoples of the world."&lt;ref name="Modernism: The Creation of Nation States"&gt;{{cite book|title=Modernism: The Creation of Nation States|page=218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8j-Uemo6SfoC&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=Turkification-Islamization-Modernization&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q=yurdu&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant early exponent of pan-Turkism was [[Enver Pasha]] (1881–1922), the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Minister of War and [[acting (law)|acting]] [[commander-in-chief]] during [[World War I]]. He later became a leader of the [[Basmachi movement]] (1916–1934) against Russian and Soviet rule in [[Central Asia]]. During World War II, the [[Nazis]] organized a [[Turkestan legion]] composed primarily of soldiers who hoped to develop an independent [[Central Asia]]n state after the war. The German intrigue bore no fruit.&lt;ref name="Gilyazov" /&gt;

After the late-20th-century [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], the Turkic peoples were more independent in business and politics:
{{quote|The aim of all Turks is to unite with the Turkic borders. History is affording us today the last opportunity. In order for the [[Islamic world]] not to be forever fragmented it is necessary that the campaign against [[Nagorno-Karabakh|Karabagh]] be not allowed to abate. As a matter of fact drive the point home in [[Azeri]] circles that the campaign should be pursued with greater determination and severity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kâzım Karabekir|Karabekir]], Istiklâl Harbimiz/n.2/, p. 631&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Pan-Turkic movements and organizations are focusing on the economic integration of the sovereign [[List of Turkic states and empires|Turkic states]] and hope to form an economic and political union similar to the [[European Union]].

==Turkey's role==
[[Turkey]]'s efforts have not met the expectations of the Turkic states or the country's pan-Turkist supporters. Modest housing projects promised to the [[Crimean Tatars]] have not been completed after many years. 

Some language communities have switched to the Latin alphabet, but the official [[Turkmen alphabet|Turkmen]], [[Uzbek alphabet|Uzbek]] and [[Azerbaijani alphabet|Azerbaijani]] Latin alphabets are not as compatible with the [[Turkish alphabet]] as Turkey had hoped after a [[Pan-Turkic Alphabet]] with 35 letters had been agreed upon in the early 1990s prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 
The [[Kazakh alphabets]] already include Latin ones, and Kazakhstan is planned to be fully converted to the Latin alphabet by 2025. Kyrgyzstan has not seriously considered adopting the Latin script, but the idea was entertained by some politicians during the country's first few years of independence, and Roman [[Kyrgyz alphabets]] exist.

==Criticism==
Pan-Turkism is often perceived as a new form of Turkish imperial ambition. Some view the Young Turk leaders who saw pan-Turkist ideology as a way to reclaim the prestige of the Ottoman Empire as racist and chauvinistic.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob M. Landau. Pan-Turkism: From Irredentism to Cooperation. India University Press, 1995.  2nd Edition.

Sharpe (January 2003).  pg 278: "Concluding that their liberal experiment had been a failure, CUP leaders turned to Pan-Turkism, a xenophobic and chauvinistic brand of nationalism that sought to create a new empire based on Islam and Turkish ethnicity ... It was in this context of revolutionary and ideological transformation and war that the fateful decision to destroy the Armenians was taken."&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe that pan-Turkism guided [[ethnic cleansing]], such as the [[Armenian Genocide|Armenian]], [[Greek genocide|Greek]], and [[Assyrian genocide]]s.

It further condemns the denial of the Armenian Genocide by the Turkish government and its official and unofficial agents and supporters".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Enver Pasha]] was a key player in the attempt to remove non-Muslim minorities from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in order to build a new pan-Turkic state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenian-genocide.org/young_turks.html Young Turks and the Armenian Genocide], Armenian National Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Melson, [[Leo Kuper]], "Revolution and genocide: on the origins of the Armenian genocide and the Holocaust", University of Chicago Press, 1996.  pg 139: "It was in this context of exclusion and war that CUP made a decision to destroy the Armenians as a viable national community in Turkey and the pan-Turkic empire.

The Armenian, Greek, and [[Assyrian genocide]]s took place under the [[Three Pashas]] of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="AssyGen"&gt;Samuel Totten, Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven L.

===={{anchor|Viewpoint on Armenian history}}Armenian history====
Clive Foss, professor of ancient history at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]], has done extensive archeological work in Turkey and he is an expert on ancient Armenian coins. In his article, "The Turkish View of Armenian History: A Vanishing Nation", Foss writes that the Turkish government was "systematically changing the names of villages to make them more Turkish. Any name which does not have a meaning in Turkish, or does not sound Turkish, whatever its origin, is replaced by a banal name assigned by a bureau in [[Ankara]], with no respect for local conditions or traditions".&lt;ref name="FossVan"&gt;Clive Foss, “The Turkish View of Armenian History: A Vanishing Nation,” in ''The Armenian Genocide: History, Politics, Ethics'', ed. by Richard G. Hovannisian (New York: St. Martins Press, 1992), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Foss, the Turkish government "presented [Armenia] ambiguously, without clear identification of [its] builders, or as examples of the influence of the superiority of Turkish architecture. In all this, a clear line is evident: the Armenian presence is to be consigned, as far as possible, to oblivion".&lt;ref name="FossVan"/&gt;

Foss notes critically that in ''1982: The Armenian File in the Light of History'', Cemal Anadol writes that the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] Scythians and Parthians are Turks. According to 'genius' Anadol, the Armenians welcomed the Turks into the region; their language is a mixture with no roots and their alphabet is mixed, with 11 characters borrowed from the ancient Turkic alphabet. Foss calls this view [[historical revisionism]]: "Turkish writings have been tendentious: history has been viewed as performing a useful service, proving or supporting a point of view, and so it is treated as something flexible which can be manipulated at will".&lt;ref name="FossVan"/&gt; He concludes, "The notion, which seems well established in Turkey, that the Armenians were a wandering tribe without a home, who never had a state of their own, is of course entirely without any foundation in fact. The logical consequence of the commonly expressed view of the Armenians is that they have no place in Turkey, and never did. The result would be the same if the viewpoint were expressed first, and the history written to order. In a sense, something like this seems to have happened, for most Turks who grew up under the Republic were educated to believe in the ultimate priority of Turks in all parts of history, and to ignore Armenians all together; they had been clearly consigned to oblivion."&lt;ref name="FossVan"/&gt;

After the [[October Revolution]], the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] attitude to Türkism did not differ from the attitude of the Russian Empire. At the 10th Congress of Bolshevik Communist Party in 1921, the party "condemned pan-Turkism as a slope to bourgeois-democratic nationalism". The emergence of a pan-Turkism scare in Soviet propaganda made it one of the most frightening political labels in the USSR. The most widespread accusation used in the lethal repression of educated Tatars and other Turkic peoples during the 1930s was that of pan-Turkism.&lt;ref&gt;Mansur Hasanov, Academician of Academy of Sciences of Tatarstan republic, in "People's Political Newspaper" № 96–97 (24393-24394) 17 May 2001 http://www.rt-online.ru/numbers/public/?ID=25970&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia, China, and Iran say that they perceive pan-Turkism as a new form of Turkish imperial ambition, and some see it as racist. Critics believe that the concept is flawed because of the distinct dialects spoken by the Turkic peoples, which sometimes led to miscommunication. Concerns also exist about religious differences. Although most Turks are [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]], there are also predominantly [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'i]] peoples (like [[Azerbaijanis]]) and predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] peoples (like [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]] or [[Yakuts]]).

{{Expert needed|Sociology|date=September 2009}}
The '''sociology of immigration''' involves the sociological analysis of immigration, particularly with respect to [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[ethnicity]], [[social structure]], and political [[policy]]. Important concepts include [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[enculturation]], [[marginalization]], [[multiculturalism]], [[postcolonialism]], [[transnationalism]] and [[social cohesion]].

==History==

===Twentieth century===

Global immigration during the twentieth century was particularly rapid during the first half of the century. Due to the emergence of World War I and World War II, European immigrants came to the United States in vast quantities. Particularly following the end of World War I, Americans labeled European immigrants as dangerous to American culture.&lt;ref name="Fleegler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fleegler|first1=Robert|title=Haney Foundation Series : Ellis Island Nation : Immigration Policy and American Identity in the Twentieth Century|date=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780812223385|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, the United States Congress passed the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], which placed strict quotas on immigrants entering the United States.&lt;ref name="Fleegler" /&gt;

From the 1960s to 1990s, the [[Social stigma|stigma]] labeling immigrants as "job takers" and "criminals" subsided, and instead Americans began to consider immigrants as benefactors to the American economy, culture, and political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fleegler|first1=Robert|title=Haney Foundation Series : Ellis Island Nation : Immigration Policy and American Identity in the Twentieth Century|date=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780812223385|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the negative labels that immigrants were given, during the first half of the twentieth century, influenced their actions in society and self-perceptions (known as [[labeling theory]] in sociology), immigrants now began to assimilate more easily into society and form strong [[social network]]s that contributed to their acquisition of [[social capital]]—the "information, knowledge of people or things, and connections that help individuals enter, gain power in, or otherwise leverage social networks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93774-9|page=166|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-first century===

Sociologists have studied immigration closely in the twenty-first century. Compared to the majority of European immigrants entering the United States during the early twentieth century, the twenty-first century witnessed the arrival of immigrants predominately from Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. From 2000 to 2001, sociologists have paid particular attention to the costs and benefits of the new diversified immigration population on American institutions, culture, economic functions, and national security.&lt;ref name="FLEEGLER"/&gt; After the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, sociologists closely analyzed the symbolism of increased anti-immigration rhetoric, directed at Middle Eastern immigrants, stemming from Americans. Structural functionalists theorists have also studied the effects of mass migration—resulting from wars, economic insecurity, and terrorism—on the [[Institution|social institutions]] of host nations, international law, and assimilation rates. Additionally, sociologists exercising [[social conflict theory]] have analyzed, in particular, labor market conflicts resulting from increased marketplace competition due to the rise in competition between immigrants and native workers for jobs and [[social mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vallejo|first1=Jody Agius|title=Research in the Sociology of Work : Immigration and Work|date=2015|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|location=Bingley, UK|isbn=9781784416324|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because rates of global immigration are continuing to increase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Llosa|first1=Alvaro Vargas|title=Global Crossings : Immigration, Civilization, and America|date=2013|publisher=Independent Institute|location=Oakland, CA|isbn=9781598131338|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the field of sociology has a particular interest in monitoring twenty-first century immigration as it relates to the foundational theories of symbolic interactionism, social conflict, and structural functionalism.

===Generational change===

In immigration studies, social scientists assign distinct definitions to various [[immigrant generations]]. In sociology, the word "generation" is used as a "measure of distance from the 'old country'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marrow|first1=Helen|last2=Ueda|first2=Reed|last3=Waters|first3=Mary|title=The New Americans : A Guide to Immigration since 1965|date=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780674023574|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that people who move to, in the case of immigrants migrating to the United States, the United States from another society, as adults, are considered "first generation" immigrants, their American-born children as "second generation" immigrants, and their children in turn as "third generation" immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marrow|first1=Helen|last2=Ueda|first2=Reed|last3=Waters|first3=Mary|title=The New Americans : A Guide to Immigration since 1965|date=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780674023574|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-twentieth century in the United States, the first, second, and third generations of immigrants displayed distinct characteristics. Second generation immigrants, due to being the parents of immigrants and witnessing the historical events unfolding in the mid-twentieth century, created a distinct [[social identity]] both in themselves and in popular American culture. In the late 1930s, American historian [[Marcus Lee Hansen]] observed "distinct differences in attitudes toward ethnic identity between the second generation and their third-generation children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marrow|first1=Helen|last2=Ueda|first2=Reed|last3=Waters|first3=Mary|title=The New Americans : A Guide to Immigration since 1965|date=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780674023574|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the second generation was anxious to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]], the third generation was sentimentally invested in "[[ethnicity]]", which is defined by sociologist Dalton Conley as "one's ethnic quality or affiliation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93774-9|page=333|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, twenty-first century immigrants now assimilate more than their twentieth-century predecessors, most notably in the transition to using English—among immigrants who move to the United States—as the primary language for communication.

While contemporary immigrant generations share common ethnic backgrounds and cultures, there are differences in the level of [[social mobility]], economic achievement, educational attainment, and familial relations among the members of those generations.

==Three sociological perspectives==

===Symbolic interactionism===

Symbolic interactionism is a "micro-level theory in which shared meanings, orientations, and assumptions form the basic motivations behind people's actions".&lt;ref name="Conley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93774-9|page=31|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, as opposed to [[macrosociology]], is focused on how face-to-face interactions create the social world.

In order to understand how perceptions of immigrants are formed and constructed, symbolic interactionism theory has been utilized. Immigration into the United States has been on the rise since 1965.&lt;ref name="Sobczak"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobczak|first1=Michael|title=The New Americans: Recent Immigration and American Society : American Attitudes toward Immigrants and Immigration Policy (1)|date=July 2010|publisher=LFB Scholarly Publishing LLC|location=El Paso, Texas|isbn=9781593323868|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion polls have demonstrated "that the percentage of Americans who wanted immigration decreased to be very low immediately prior to 1965, but had begun an upward incline from 1965 to the late 1970's at which time it thereafter increased dramatically".&lt;ref name="Sobczak"/&gt; One of the reasons why there is a negative native response to increased immigration is because of the often-negative images of immigrants being elicited by the media. Moreover, immigration legislation, such as the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act]], increased anti-immigration sentiment, and nativist rhetoric, and social movements in the United States.&lt;ref name="Sobczak" /&gt; Perceived group threat also has been proven to maintain an important role in explaining Americans' attitude toward immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobczak|first1=Michael|title=The New Americans: Recent Immigration and American Society : American Attitudes toward Immigrants and Immigration Policy (1)|date=2010|publisher=LFB Scholarly Publishing LLC|location=El Paso, Texas|isbn=9781593323868|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of foreigners altering aspects of the established culture, such as the native language, results in nativist sentiment and further polarization. Together, these instances illustrate the significance of immigrants' [[master status]] in shaping how others perceive them, and how they perceive themselves. For example, the racial stigma that Mexican immigrants encounter in the United States "reinforces the low status and the self perceptions of Mexican Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Uggen|first1=Hartmann|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780393912326|page=275|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mexican Americans internalize this perception of their [[Race (human categorization)|race]], they begin to act accordingly and indirectly reinforce this perception.

The rise in [[islamophobia]] in the United States, after the attacks on the World Trade Center, is an example of symbolic interactionism in practice. After the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, "Arabs and Muslims (as well as Latinos, South Asians, and other individuals who were mistakenly perceived to be Arab or Muslim based on their skin color, dress, or organizational affiliations) suffered an unprecedented outbreak of backlash violence" because of assumptions by others that they were terrorists who intended to do harm to Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peek|first1=Lori|title=Behind the Backlash : Muslim Americans After 9/11|date=2010|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9781592139828|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the days and months following the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], Muslims and Arabs were subject to hate crimes based on personal characteristics such as their clothing, accent, facial hair, and skin tone. From a symbolic interactionist perspective, the violent attacks against Arabs and Muslims resulted from the shared assumptions and meanings that Americans attributed to Arab and Muslim people and culture.

===Social conflict===

[[Social conflict theory]] is a sociological perspective that views society as a constant struggle for power and resources. This theory holds that competition between competing interests is a central function of society. Social conflict theorists believe that competition for power and resources results in social change.

Since the early nineteenth century, advocates and opponents of immigration have analyzed the economic effects of immigration on national economies and workforces. Opponents of national increases in immigration rates have argued that restricting immigration "improves the economic well-being of native workers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borjas|first1=George|title=Heaven's Door : Immigration Policy and the American Economy|date=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691088969|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration, opponents argue, causes unemployment for native workers. The reasoning behind this argument is that immigrant peoples compete with the native peoples for jobs and resources. This increased competition results in more jobs going to immigrant workers since it costs less for employers to hire a low-skilled immigrant than a highly skilled native worker. However, advocates of immigration argue that immigration improves a nations economy since more people enter the workforce, thus resulting in higher productivity and increased competition in the labor market. Additionally, proponents argue that the native population benefits from immigration since "immigrants increase the demand for goods and services produced by native workers and firms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borjas|first1=George|title=Heaven's Door : Immigration Policy and the American Economy|date=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691088969|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social conflict theorists suggest that the competition between native workers and immigrant workers, for economic achievement and social mobility, is at the crux of the immigration debate as it relates to economics.

A common fear is that immigration will alter the native culture of a nation. In the discipline of sociology, "culture" is defined as a "set of beliefs, traditions, and practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93774-9|page=75|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the view of the in-group of a society (usually considered the majority) that the [[Non-material culture|nonmaterial culture]] (i.e. values, beliefs, behaviors, and social norms) of immigrants—the out-group—will decrease the staying power and prevalence of the native culture. An example of this scenario is the fear that continuous foreign immigration to the United States will result in the prominence of the English language fading. The competition to maintain English as the "official" language of the United States, social conflict theorists theorize, is a perpetuated struggle that American society will continue to encounter as immigration continues. Moreover, the "native vs. immigrant" competition for jobs and social mobility in an increasingly diverse and specialized labor market will, social conflict theorists argue, continue as immigration continues.

===Structural functionalism===

[[Structural functionalism]] is a sociological perspective "claiming that every society has certain structures that exist to fulfill some set of necessary functions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like A Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93774-9|page=A-8|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the ideas of sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], society through this sociological lens is thought of as a living organism—similar to the nineteenth-century theory of ''[[organicism]]''.

Regarding the economy of a society, immigrants play a prominent role in maintaining, disrupting, and/or contributing to the [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]]. For example, since the 1980s and 1990s, the American economy has favored workers who have valuable skills to offer. If immigrants to the United States, for example, have valuable skills to offer, they may "increase the chances of economic success in the United States, such as the language and culture of the American workplace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borjas|first1=George|title=Heaven's Door : Immigration Policy and the American Economy|date=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691088969|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human capital and physical resources that immigrants may have to offer can complement those that already exist in the American economy. Structural functionalists believe that, whether the effects are positive or negative, immigration significantly impacts the level of social cohesion in the workplace. This analysis of social cohesion is closely related to the work of sociologist Émile Durkheim.

Sociologists utilizing structural functionalism would explain that immigration serves the function of a unifier for the immigrant population in a foreign society. Especially in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, immigrants in the United States tended to socialize with people of similar ethnic backgrounds in order to experience group solidarity during a time of intense [[resocialization]]. This feeling of group solidarity led to increased social capital, which held people together and decreased the sense of [[anomie]] among immigrants, which is a "sense of aimlessness or despair that arises when we can no longer reasonably expect life to be predictable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93774-9|page=25|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration, therefore, served as a mechanism for [[social network]]s to be built among immigrant populations during a period of intense [[resocialization]] and prevalent cases of [[anomic suicide]].

==Transnationalism==
A more contemporary sociological analysis of immigration can be explored within the concept of [[transnationalism]]. This analysis is perhaps more concerned with the relational dimensions of immigration, particularly in terms of the ways in which families and relationships are maintained when members migrate to another country. Theorist Zlatko Skrbis argues that within a transnational network of families, the patterns of migration are intertwined with notions of 'emotion' and 'belonging'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skrbis|first=Z|title=Transnational Families: Theorizing Migration Emotions and Belonging|journal=Journal of Intercultural Studies|volume=29|issue=3|pages=231–246|doi=10.1080/07256860802169188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally the site conducts interviews with the production staff on the show and also runs events during conventions such as [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] called "Wayward Cocktails" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nerdybutflirty.com/2015/07/29/san-diego-comic-con-first-timers-experience-day-2/ |title=San Diego Comic Con: A First Timers Experience| publisher= Nerdybutflirty.com |accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which bring the fans, cast and crew of the show together.

Since 2008 the administrator of the site has been Australian fan Jules Wilkinson.

==Impact==
Supernatural Wiki has been recognized by other media outlets as a source of information about the show and its fandom. The CW Source Blog said of the site: "They’ve collected and dissected nearly every aspect of the show, the behind-the-scenes world, and the fan community, and laid it out in stunning detail.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.trb.com/network/cwsource/2007/03/supernatural_a_place_for_the_o.html|title=Supernatural: A Place for the Obsessed|
 publisher=CW Source |accessdate=2010-04-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The SuperWiki has also been referenced by media critics such as the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''’s Maureen Ryan for its coverage of conventions such as ''[[San Diego Comic-Con International]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/comiccon/ |title=Comic-Con roundup: 'True Blood,' 'Lost,' 'Supernatural' and more|publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=2010-04-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has become an information resource by writers, production staff and cast. Writer Robbie Thompson called it an "indispensable" resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Edited by Lynn Zubernis and Katherine Larsen|title=Fan Phenomena: Supernatural|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=JvUdAwAAQBAJ&amp;q=robbie#v=snippet&amp;q=robbie&amp;f=false|date=May 2014|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=9781783202034|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Star Jared Padalecki said "I'm on the show, and I'm on (Supernatural Wiki) more than once a week researching it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://fangasmthebook.wordpress.com/2016/09/04/vancon-sunday-j2-day/|title=Vancon Sunday – J2 Day!|publisher=Fangasm|accessdate=2016-11-16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was credited by author [[Keith R. A. DeCandido]] in the acknowledgments to his ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' tie-in novel ''Nevermore''.

In February 2009, the site established a Twitter presence at [https://twitter.com/SuperWiki @SuperWiki]. As of 4 April 2017, the site has 101, 491 followers, including many of the cast and crew from ''Supernatural''.

On 7 September 2009, in the lead up to the start of [[Supernatural (season 5)|Season 5]], @SuperWiki started ending tweets with the tag #luciferiscoming, and suggested fans do the same as a mischievous way to get attention for the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://twitter.com/SuperWiki/status/3810623291|title=Let's freak out the twitterverse|publisher=@SuperWiki |accessdate=2010-04-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The tag #luciferiscoming reached number 1 of the trending topics on Twitter. Rapper [[Sean Combs]] (@iamdiddy who has over a million followers), unaware of the context of #luciferiscoming and assuming it was an anti-Christian movement, started a #Godishere tweet in retaliation. Twitter moved to stop posts with tags including both God and Lucifer from appearing in trending topics. Fans continued to use #supernatural and #inkripkewetrust, and both also reached high on the list of trending topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/lucifer-is-coming-how-supernat-31138.aspx|title=Lucifer is coming:: How 'Supernatural' Stole Twitter

==Awards==
In April 2011 the site won the [[SFX (magazine)]] Best Franchise Specific website award beating out chucktv.net, The One Ring, Leaky Cauldron, Life, Doctor Who And Combom, and WhoFix.

SFX Magazine described the site as "The most comprehensive Supernatural site on the web, established in 2006, Supernatural Wiki is a well laid-out, intelligently designed, easy to navigate Aladdin’s cave of Winchester goodness." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2011/04/19/sfx-blog-awards-2011-the-results/ |title=SFX BLOG AWARDS 2011: The Results |publisher=SFX |accessdate=2012-09-17 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521002835/http://www.sfx.co.uk/2011/04/19/sfx-blog-awards-2011-the-results/ |archivedate=May 21, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the site was a board nominated finalist in the Shorty Social Media Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.shortyawards.com/post/75699290022/announcing-the-6th-annual-shorty-awards-nominating|title=Shorty Awards|publisher=Shorty Awards|accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9501">[[File:Tahmuras (The Shahnama of Shah Tahmasp).png|thumb|right|Tahmuras in the [[Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp]]]]
[[Image:Tahmurath-Lawrie-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Lee Lawrie]], ''Tahmurath'' (1939). Library of Congress [[John Adams Building]], Washington, D.C.]]
'''Tahmuras''' or '''Tahmures''' ({{lang-fa|تهمورث ,طهمورث}}, {{IPA-all|tʰæmures}}; from [[Avestan]] ''Taxma Urupi'') was the third [[Shah]] of the world according to [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[epic poetry|epic poem]], the ''[[Shahnameh]]''. He is considered the builder of [[Merv]].

==Tahmuras in the ''Shahnameh''==
Tahmures was the son of [[Hushang]].  In his time the world was much troubled by the [[Deev|''deev''s]] (demons) of [[Angra Mainyu|Ahriman]].  On the advice of his [[vizier]] [[Shahrasp]] ({{lang|fa|شهرسپ}}), Tahmuras used magic to subdue Ahriman and made him his slave, even riding upon his back as on a horse. The demons rebelled against Tahmuras, and he made war against them with both magic and force. By magic he bound two-thirds of the demons; the remaining third he crushed with his mace. The ''deevs'' now became Tahmuras's slaves and they taught him the art of writing in thirty different scripts.

Like his father, Tahmuras was a great inventor of arts for easing the human condition.  He invented the spinning and weaving of wool, learned to domesticate chickens, how to store up fodder for livestock instead of merely grazing them, and how to train animals like dogs and falcons to hunt for people.

Tahmuras ruled for thirty years and was succeeded by his son [[Jamshid]].

==Death of Taxmoruw, as told in a Parsi ''Rivayāt''==
[[Georges Dumézil]] provides a summary of a [[Ribaldry|bawdy]] and [[off-color humor|scatological]], but nonetheless instructive account of the death of Taxmoruw (Tahmuras) preserved in a [[Parsi]] ''[[rivayat|rivayāt]]'', translated by Danish orientalist and historian Arthur Christensen and published by [[Friedrich von Spiegel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Les types du premier homme et du premier roi dans l'histoire légendaire des Iraniens'' Part I (1917) by Christensen,Arthur pps. 184-189.&lt;/ref&gt;This (admittedly late) text furnishes material that Dumézil considers to preserve archaic [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] themes with a bearing on what he termed the problem of ''le borgne'' and ''le manchot'' i.e. of 'the one-eyed (god)' and 'the one-handed (god)' - relating, in this instance, specifically to the mythic motif of one-handedness.

The scene for this scurrilous episode is set by the account in the [[Avesta]] of the reign of Taxma Urupi, which relates that this sovereign of the world subdued not only demons and sorcerers, but also the archfiend Angra Mainyu himself, thanks to the help of the wind god [[Vayu-Vata|Vayu]] and his (Taxma Urupi's) possession of the [[khvarenah]] or mystic 'kingly glory'. Thus empowered, the valiant king is able to ride Angra Mainyu, like a horse, 'from one end of the earth to the other', every day for thirty years. (At this point the Avesta falls silent and the Parsi ''rivayât'' takes up the story). Ahriman (Angra Mainyu), exasperated by his undignified bondage as a beast of burden, manages finally to win (by means of a gift of jewellery) the confidence of Taxmoruw's wife, from whom he learns that there is a certain point on the daily ride - a particularly treacherous part of a mountain track - at which Taxmoruw experiences a moment of [[vertigo|vertiginous]] dread. The following day Ahriman bides his time until 'horse' and rider reach the critical point - at which he seizes his chance, rearing up, throwing Taxmoruw to the ground and swallowing the unfortunate king whole. Time passes, but Taxmoruw's corpse is not found, remaining in Ahriman's belly.

Meanwhile, [[Jamshid]], Taxmoruw's devoted brother (not son, as in the Shahnameh), scours the world in search of his body until eventually he learns from [[Sraosha|Srosh]], the well-nigh omniscient confidant of [[Ahura Mazda]], that it is hidden in Ahriman's bowels. Jamshid begs Srosh to tell him some magical trick to retrieve the body from its unsavoury resting place, whereupon Srosh reveals that Ahriman loves two things above all else : music and [[anal sex]]. Acting on Srôsh's advice, Jamshid then travels to the area where Ahriman is living and begins to sing. Attracted by the music, the demon duly appears and begins capering about and [[masturbation|masturbating]] in anticipation of his other favourite activity.

Jamshid agrees to penetrate Ahriman on condition that he first be allowed to remove Taxmoruw's body from the demon's bowels. The excited Ahriman agrees readily to the bargain and bends over, presenting his [[anus]], whereupon Jamshid plunges his hand up the demon's [[rectum]], deep into his belly, quickly pulls out his brother's corpse, places it on the ground and flees. Ahriman gives chase, but Jamshid runs on and on, taking care (as instructed previously by Srosh) not to look back at his pursuer and, more especially not to look him in the face. Ahriman tires and, baulked of both pleasure and prey, descends once more into hell.

Jamshid then returns to the spot where he left Taxmoruw's body, constructs the [[prototype|prototypical]] [[Tower of Silence]] and places the body on it for [[excarnation]] by birds of prey, in the manner still considered ritually correct by Zoroastrians to this day. Thankful that he has at last been able to give his brother a fitting funeral, Jamshid can finally take time to glance at the hand which has been up Ahriman's anus and sees, to his horror, that it is pale and stinking, starting to waste away with a foul disease similar to [[leprosy]]. The disease grows steadily worse, the hand withering and growing ever more painful, and Jamshid becomes sad at his deformity, shunning human society and haunting, hermit-like, the loneliest of mountains and deserts. All, however, ends happily, for one night, as the wretched man lies asleep, an [[ox]] [[urinates]] on his blighted hand, healing it. Thus comes about the discovery of ''gōmēz'' - cattle [[urine]], considered as the purificatory liquid ''par excellence'' in Zoroastrianism and used as such in the nine-night ritual of [[Barashnûm]], (as detailed in the 9th chapter of the [[Vendidad]]).

==Takhmurup and the Three Sacred Fires in the ''Bundahishn''==
According to verses 8-9 of the eighteenth chapter of the cosmological treatise known as the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', the three preeminent [[Atar]] (Great Fires) of ancient Iran - Farnbag, Gushnasp and Burzin Mihr - were brought thither on the back of the ox Srishok from a place named Khwaniratha, during the reign of the primordial ruler Takhmurup - presumably with his knowledge and possibly at his command. The text of the Bundahishn is not easy to interpret at this point, but seems to mean that a group of  men were riding beside the (Caspian?) sea on the back of the ox, transporting with them a fire altar, upon which were burning the three atar (holy fires). A storm then sprang up and the wind whipped the fire altar off Srishok's back and carried it out to sea. The three holy fires, however, were not quenched but miraculously remained burning on the waters, lighting the men (or passing seafarers?) to their (unspecified) destination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avesta.org/mp/grb12.htm#chap18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Persian Mythology'', by Hinnells, John R., volume in the series ''Library of the World's Myths and Legends'' pub. Newnes Books 1985&lt;/ref&gt;The unusual concept of fire burning in the midst of water is found also in relation to the ancient Indo-Iranian deity [[Apam Napat]] and both occurrences of the mythological motif may owe something to early observation of flames (derived from the welling up of natural hydrocarbons) hovering near the surface of  the [[Caspian Sea]] - more specifically the Southwestern part, exploited currently by the [[Absheron gas field]] near [[Baku]] in [[Azerbaijan]].

==Erection of Shiraz==
According to certain [[Culture of Iran|Iranian traditions]], the city of [[Shiraz]] was originally built by Tahmures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conder|first=Josiah|title=Persia and China|publisher=Printed for J. Duncan|date=1827}}, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Some native writers have claimed that the name Shiraz is derived from that of Tahmuras's son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conder|first=Josiah|title=Persia and China|publisher=Printed for J. Duncan|date=1827}}, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

In engineering, '''technical documentation''' refers to any type of [[documentation]] that describes handling, functionality and architecture of a technical product or a product under [[product development|development]] or use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transcom.de/transcom/en/technische-dokumentation.htm What is "technical documentation"?] at Transcom.de. Accessed February 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tetras.sk/en/stranka/what-is-technical-documentation What is Technical Documentation?] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130418132550/http://www.tetras.sk/en/stranka/what-is-technical-documentation |date=2013-04-18 }} at Tetras Translations. Accessed February 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igcseict.info/theory/8/docs/index.html Documenting the New System] at IGCSE ICT. Accessed February 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The intended recipient for product technical documentation is both the (proficient) [[end user]] as well as the administrator / service or [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] technician. In contrast to a mere "cookbook" [[User guide|manual]], technical documentation aims at providing enough information for a user to understand inner and outer dependencies of the product at hand.

If [[technical writer]]s are employed by the technology company, their task is to translate the usually highly formalized or abbreviated technical documentation produced during the development phase into more readable, "user-friendly" prose.

The documentation accompanying a piece of technology is often the only means by which the user can fully understand said technology; regardless, technical documentation is often considered a "necessary evil" by software developers. Consequently, the genre has suffered from what some industry experts lament as a lack of attention and precision.&lt;ref name=mob&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131009233720/http://www.istc.org.uk/what-is-technical-communication/the-documentation-scene/ The Documentation Scene] by John Mobbs. [[Institute of Scientific and Technical Communicators]], Monday, July 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing and maintaining documentation involves many technical and non-technical skills, and this work is often not enjoyed or rewarded as much as writing and maintaining code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geiger|first=R.

==Forms of technical documentation==
Technical documentation may include:
* [[patent]]s
* [[specification]]s of item or of components/materials
* [[data sheet]]s of item or of components/materials
* [[test method]]s
* [[manufacturing]] standards
*

During development, a multitude of document types will play a significant role:
*[[system requirements]]
*[[system design]]
*[[system architecture]]
and various intermediate or intervening documents thereof.

==Standardization of forms==
Traditionally, most forms of technical documentation have lacked recognized standards, though this is changing.&lt;ref name=mob/&gt; So far, [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] has published a series of [[International standard|standards]] related to technical product documentations and these are covered by ICS 01.110.&lt;ref name=tpd&gt;{{cite web

'''''Telstra Corporation Limited v Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd''''' is a 2001 decision of the [[Federal Court of Australia]] related to the originality required to attract [[copyright]] protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|612|2001|litigants=Telstra Corporation Limited v Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd |date=25 May 2001 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heard before Justice Finkelstein in June 2000, the case concerned the release of a product called "Phonedisc" created by the Respondents, Desktop Marketing Systems.

==Decision==
In his decision handed down on 25 May 2001, Justice Finkelstein found that the contents of that product, which allowed the user to perform [[Reverse telephone directory|reverse telephone searches]] by [[service number]], was almost identical in content to the publicly listed directories, even if some of the content was listed in a different fashion. The court found that [[Telstra]], the Australian owner/publisher of the [[White pages|White Pages]] and [[Yellow Pages]] telephone directories, had copyright in the content of those directories. Consequently, the use of the data by the Respondents constituted [[copyright infringement]], and the product was removed from sale. Furthermore, as a result of this decision, a similar web-based directory called "Blackpages", published by [[2600 Australia]], also terminated its service.

==Appeal to the Full Court==
The Full Court of the Federal Court rejected an appeal by Desktop Marketing Systems, followed the UK approach in ''[[Walter v Lane]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Walter v Lane]]'' [1900] {{abbr|AC|Appeal Cases}} 539, [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] (UK).&lt;/ref&gt; with emphasis on the effort and expense incurred by Telstra in collecting the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|112|2002|litigants=Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd |date=15 May 2002 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Subsequent consideration==
On 8 February 2010, the decision was overturned in a ruling by Justice Gordon by [[Telstra v Phone Directories]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|44|2010|litigants=Telstra Corporation Ltd v Phone Directories Company Pty Ltd |link=Telstra v Phone Directories |date=8 February 2010 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the decision of the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] in [[Australian Digital Alliance#IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (2009)|IceTV v Nine Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|2009|litigants=IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd |link=Australian Digital Alliance#IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (2009) |parallelcite=(2009) 239 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 458 |date=22 April 2009 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling stated that copyright was not applicable to these works as Telstra conceded that there was no identifiable author contributing to the publication, even considering third parties, and hence did not represent a sufficient literary effort to warrant protection. Further considerations were raised regarding the level of collaboration required between staff members to warrant the concept of joint authorship, as well as the level of intellectual effort required to arrange and organise the listings. Subsequently, none of the works were established as "original works", noting that there should exist a correlative relationship between originality and authorship.

[[File:New Yorker building.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[New Yorker Hotel]], purchased by the Unification Church of the United States in 1976 and now the site of national church headquarters offices.]]
The '''Unification Church of the United States''', sometimes colloquially referred to as the '''"[[Moonie (nickname)|Moonies]]"''', is a [[new religious movement]] in the [[United States|United States of America]]. It began in the 1950s and 1960s when missionaries from [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] were sent to the United States by the international [[Unification Church]]'s founder and leader [[Sun Myung Moon]]. It expanded in the 1970s and then became involved in controversy due to its theology, its political activism, and the lifestyle of its members. Since then it has been involved in many areas of American society and has established businesses, news media, projects in education and the arts as well as taking part in political and social activism, and has itself gone through substantial changes.

==Early history==
In the late 1950s and early 1960s  [[missionary|missionaries]] from the [[Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity]] (HSA-UWC) of [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] came to the United States. Among them were [[Young Oon Kim]], [[Sang Ik-Choi]], [[Bo Hi Pak]], [[David S. C. Kim]], and [[Mose Durst|Yun Soo Lim]]. Missionary work took place in [[Washington D.C.]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Oregon]], and [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Unification Church in America, 1959–1974: Emergence of a National Movement'', Michael L. Mickler, 1987, New York: Garland, {{ISBN|0-8153-1138-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Unification Church first came to public notice in the United States after [[sociology]] student [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]] studied Young Oon Kim's group and published his findings as a doctoral thesis entitled: ''The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes'', which was published in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]] as ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]].''  This book is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of [[religious conversion]], and one of the first modern sociological studies of a new religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

In 1965 Moon visited the United States and established what he called "holy grounds" in each of the 48 contiguous states.&lt;ref name = "2014 tour"&gt;[http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/religion/church-finds-holy-ground-sin-city Church finds ‘holy ground’ in Sin City], ''[[Las Vegas Review Journal]]'', June 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1971 the Unification Church of the United States had about 500 members. By the end of the 1970s it had expanded to about 5,000 members, with most of them being in their early 20s.  In the 1980s and 1990s membership remained at about the same number.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J. Gordon &amp; Moore, Robert L. ''The Cult Experience: Responding to the New Religious Pluralism''. New York: The Pilgrim Press (1984 [3rd printing; 1st printing 1982]); pg. 8. "...audiences are surprised to learn that the Unification Church has less than 5,000 members in the U.S., because the press often gives the impression of far larger numbers." Melton is a leading expert on new religious movements.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finke, Roger &amp; Stark, Rodney. ''The Churching of America, 1776–1990''. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press (1992; 3rd printing 1997); pg. 241. "...after more than thirty years of missionizing, it is estimated that there have never been more than 5,000 followers of the Unification Church... in the United States, some of whom are from abroad."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120111212356/http://faculty.arec.umd.edu/cmcausland/RALi/The%20Market%20for%20Martyrs.pdf The Market for Martyrs], [[Laurence Iannaccone]], [[George Mason University]], 2006, "One of the most comprehensive and influential studies was [[The Making of a Moonie: Choice or Brainwashing?]] by [[Eileen Barker]] (1984). Barker could find no evidence that Moonie recruits were ever kidnapped, confined, or coerced. Participants at Moonie retreats were not [[deprived of sleep]]; the lectures were not "trance-inducing"; and there was not much chanting, no drugs or alcohol, and little that could be termed "frenzy" or "ecstatic" experience. People were free to leave, and leave they did. Barker's extensive enumerations showed that among the recruits who went so far as to attend two-day retreats (claimed to be the Moonie's most effective means of "brainwashing"), fewer than 25% joined the group formore than a week and only 5% remained full-time members one year later. And, of course, most contacts dropped out before attending a retreat. Of all those who visited a Moonie centre at least once, not one in two-hundred remained in the movement two years later. With failure rates exceeding 99.5%, it comes as no surprise that '''full-time Moonie membership in the U.S. never exceeded a few thousand.''' And this was one of the most successful New Religious Movements of the era!"&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars have attributed the Unification Church's relative success in the United States, as compared to other [[Western nations]], to its support of [[patriotism]] and [[capitalist]] values, and to its [[multi-racial]] membership.&lt;ref&gt;Regulating Religion: Case Studies from Around the Globe (Google eBook), [[James T.

Many of these members are attractive, well-educated graduates from some of our finest colleges and universities. Their membership in the movement should remind us that for the young adult (18–25 years of age) conversion has a highly ideological and vocational dimension."&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have also noted that this period of Unification Church growth in the United States took place just as the "[[hippie]]" era of the late 1960s and early 1970s was ending, when many American young people were looking for a sense of higher purpose or community in their lives.&lt;ref name=NewYorker&gt;[http://www.petermaass.com/core.cfm?p=1&amp;mag=48&amp;magtype=1 Moon at Twilight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411094005/http://www.petermaass.com/core.cfm?p=1&amp;mag=48&amp;magtype=1 |date=2001-04-11 }}, ''The New Yorker'' September 14, 1998, "David Bromley, a professor of sociology and religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, who has co-written a book about the Unification Church, believes that the bulk of Moon's remaining followers were recruited in the seventies, when both the establishment and the counterculture were falling apart.

Kent]],  Syracuse University Press, 2001, page 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 Moon decided to move to the United States. He then asked church members to help him in a series of outreach campaigns in which he spoke to public audiences in all 50 states, ending with a 1976 rally in Washington D.C. in which he spoke on the grounds of the [[Washington Monument]] to around 300,000 people.&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2000 pages 13–16"&gt;Introvigne 2000 pages 13–16&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time many church members left school and careers to devote their full-time to church work. [[Mobile fundraising team]]s were set up to raise money for church projects, often giving candy or flowers in exchange for donations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910836,00.html Moon-struck], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', October 15, 1973, "The core members—most in their 20s, many of them converts from other spiritual, psychological or political trips—display a dogged devotion that makes even Jehovah's Witnesses look like backsliders. They are enthusiastic capitalists who rise at dawn to hit the streets with wares to exchange for "donations": flowers, votive light candles, even peanuts. Last year, when Master Moon moved his international headquarters to Tarrytown, N.Y., members sold candles across the U.S. for seven weeks to meet the down payment of $300,000 on an $850,000 estate."&lt;/ref&gt; Moon also brought members from [[Europe]] and [[Japan]] to work in the United States. Church buildings were purchased around the nation. In [[New York State]] the Belvedere Estate, the [[Unification Theological Seminary]], and the [[New Yorker Hotel]] were purchased. The national headquarters of the church was established in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2000 pages 13–16"/&gt; In [[Washington D.C.]] the church purchased a church building from [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705394920/Friends-Forever-gather-to-remember-the-Washington-Ward.html Friends Forever gather to remember the Washington Ward], [[Deseret News]], November 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Seattle]] the historic [[Rolland Denny mansion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/paynter/324520_paynt23.html A Seattle jewel shines again], ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', July 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://digital.lib.washington.edu/architect/structures/8997/ Architect Data Base]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Nonetheless, one final and inescapable conflict remains before us, the war between democracy and communism. Although each side has equipped itself with fearsome weapons and is pitted against the other in readiness for battle, the core of their conflict is internal and ideological. Which side will triumph in this final ideological conflict? Anyone who believes in the reality of God will surely answer that democracy will win."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/beyond-the-dark-side-of-the-moonies-1536853.html Beyond the Dark Side of the Moonies], [[Andrew Brown (writer)|Andrew Brown]], ''[[The Independent]]'', November 2, 1995, "The Moonies were - and remain - intent on halting communism. Moon founded the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity in Korea in 1954. The first missionaries were sent out in the Fifties, but only after Moon moved to the US in the Seventies did the movement start to become visible in the West.
Moon's followers believe he is the Messiah who can lead the way to establishing the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. Their beliefs are set out in the Divine Principle, which contains interpretations of the Old and New Testaments with further revelations from Moon himself. Devotees believe God's victory over Satan requires the defeat of atheistic communism. To this end they have sponsored large numbers of conferences for journalists, theologians, academics, politicians and anyone else they think might contribute to establishing a God-centred world."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 Moon asked church members to support President [[Richard Nixon]] during the [[Watergate scandal]] when Nixon was being pressured to resign his office.  Church members prayed and fasted in support of Nixon for three days in front of the [[United States Capitol]], under the motto: "Forgive, Love and Unite." On February 1, 1974 Nixon publicly thanked them for their support and officially received Moon. This brought the church into widespread public and media attention.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, 2000 page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unification Church of the United States sponsored other anti-communist activities during the 1970s and 1980s, including the multi-national organization [[CAUSA International]].&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, 2000, page 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/augustweb-only/8-6-37.0.html Sun Myung Moon's Followers Recruit Christians to Assist in Battle Against Communism] [[Christianity Today]] June 15, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 Moon founded the conservative newspaper ''[[The Washington Times]]'', in [[Washington D.C.]], as part of [[News World Communications]], an international news media conglomerate which also publishes newspapers in South Korea, Japan, and South America.  Although never a financial success, the ''Times'' was well-read in conservative and anti-communist circles and was credited by President [[Ronald Reagan]] with helping to win the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Gorenfeld, John, [http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9868 Dear Leader's Paper Moon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918041932/http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9868 |date=2008-09-18 }} [[The American Prospect]] 2005-09-19  "The American people know the truth.

In 1983 church members publicly protested against the [[Soviet Union]] over its shooting down of [[Korean Airlines Flight 007]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/29/PK2812ETF2.DTL] [[San Francisco Chronicle]] September 3, 1983 "For a second day, the Soviet Consulate in Pacific Heights was the scene of emotional protests against the shooting down of a Korean Air Lines jumbo jet. About 300 people held demonstration yesterday morning. Among them were members of the Unification Church, or "Moonies," whose founder is the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the controversial South Korean who has melded a fierce anti-communism into his ideology. Eldridge Cleaver, the onetime black radical who recently has had ties with the Moonies, spoke at the rally. Many pickets carried signs accusing the Soviet Union of murdering the 269 passengers and crew aboard the airliner. In another development, San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli filed a $109 billion lawsuit against the Soviet Union on behalf of the 269 victims."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, church member [[Dan Fefferman]] founded the International Coalition for Religious Freedom in [[Virginia]], which is active in protesting what it considers to be threats to [[religious freedom]] by governmental agencies.&lt;ref name="ire"&gt;{{cite news | last =Ribadeneira | first =Diego | title =Ire at school Star of David ruling unites ACLU, Pat Robertson | work =[[The Boston Globe]] | page =B2 | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date =August 21, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1986 conservative author [[William Rusher]] wrote: "The members the Reverend Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, now almost universally referred to as '[[Moonie (nickname)|Moonies]],' constitute a fascinating problem for outsiders--and perhaps above all for conservatives, because they are so unabashedly anti-Communist and pro-American."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_v38/ai_4580948 Review of ''[[The Making of a Moonie]]''], [[William Rusher]], ''[[National Review]]'', December 19, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism, opposition, and controversy==

The Unification Church of the United States was met with widespread criticism beginning in the early 1970s.  The main points of criticism were the church's unorthodox theology, especially the belief that Moon is the [[second coming of Christ]]; the church's political involvement; and the extreme lifestyle of most members, which involved full-time dedication to church activities often at the neglect of family, school, and career. During this time, hundreds of parents of members used the services of [[Deprogramming|deprogrammers]] to remove their children from church membership and the activities of the church were widely reported in the media, most often in a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, 2000, pages 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 [[Steven Hassan]] left the church and later became an outspoken critic.  He is the author of two books on his experiences and his theories on [[cult]] [[mind control]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomofmind.com/stevehassan/biography/ Steven Hassan Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;  The political activities of the church were opposed by some leftists.  In 1976 members of the [[Youth International Party]] staged a marijuana "smoke-in" in the middle of a UC sponsored rally in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;''From Slogans to Mantras: Social Protest and Religious Conversion in the Late Vietnam War Era'', [[Stephen A. Kent]],  Syracuse University Press, 2001, page 168&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 church president [[Neil Albert Salonen]] met with Senator [[Bob Dole]] to defend the Unification Church against charges made by its critics, including parents of some members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7hIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cOUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3636,2969007&amp;hl=en Dole meeting with Moon aide called cordial], ''Lawrence Journal-World'', February 24, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1977, church member [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]], who later became well known as the author of the popular [[Intelligent Design]] book ''[[Icons of Evolution]]'', defended Unification Church theology against what he said were unfair criticisms by the [[National Council of Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unification/Talks/Antal/Antal_nccc.htm New Hope for Dialogue with National Council of Churches of Christ], Chris Antal, February, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; That same year [[Frederick Sontag]], a professor of philosophy at [[Pomona College]] and a minister in the [[United Church of Christ]],&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-frederick-sontag20-2009jun20,0,6245632.story Frederick E.

He added that he did not want to be considered an [[apologist]] for the church but a close look at its [[theology]] is important: "They raise some incredibly interesting issues."&lt;ref name="Moon: an objective look at his theology"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Se4PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OI0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7264,3898196&amp;dq=frederick-sontag Moon: an objective look at his theology], ''[[Boca Raton News]]'', 1977-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 and 1979, the church's support for the [[South Korea]]n government was investigated by [[Fraser Committee|a Congressional subcommittee]] led by [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] Representative [[Donald M. Fraser]] of [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, 2000. page 17&lt;/ref&gt; (see also: [[Koreagate]], [[Fraser Committee]]) In 1982 the [[United States Supreme Court]] struck down a Minnesota law which had imposed registration and reporting requirements on those religions that receive more than half of their contributions from nonmembers as being contrary to the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution]]'s protection of religious freedom and prohibition of state establishment of religion. The law was seen as especially targeting the Unification Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0602/060233.html A crumbling wall between CHURCH and STATE?], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', June 2, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953478,00.html Equal rights for Moonies], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', May 3, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Moon was convicted in [[United States federal court]] of willfully filing false Federal [[income tax]] returns and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]]. In 1984 and 1985, while he was serving his sentence in [[Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury]], [[Connecticut]], American Unification Church members launched a public-relations campaign claiming that the charges against him were unjust and politically motivated.  Booklets, letters and videotapes were mailed to approximately 300,000 [[Christian]] leaders. Many signed petitions protesting the government's case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/augustweb-only/8-6-33.0.html Why Are Pastors Flying to Moon?] [[Christianity Today]] August 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the American Christian leaders who spoke out in defense of Moon were conservative [[Jerry Falwell]], head of [[Moral Majority]], and liberal [[Joseph Lowery]], head of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, 2000, pages 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Tori, a professor at [[Marist College]] ([[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]]) suggested that Moon's conviction helped the Unification Church gain more acceptance in mainstream American society, since it showed that he was financially accountable to the government and the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/projects/cultures/lo121103s2.shtml Church urges Christian unity: Valley seminary open since 1975] ''Poughkeepsie Journal'', 2003-12-11"Michael Tori, a professor in Marist College's religious studies program, said the Unification Church has gained more acceptance in mainstream society for several reasons. One reason was Rev. Moon's indictment in the early 1980s for tax evasion. The indictment showed Moon was financially accountable to the government and to the public, Tori said. Another reason the church has gained greater acceptance is that it has taken on several universally accepted causes such as the importance of family values in society and the formation of the Interreligious and International Peace Council. The church has also given financial support to institutions such as the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut and made acquisitions such as the purchase of the Washington Times."&lt;/ref&gt;(see also: [[United States vs. Sun Myung Moon]])

==Changes in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s==

On July 1, 1982 a large number of the members of the Unification Church of the United States were married by Rev. and Mrs. Moon in a [[Blessing Ceremony of the Unification Church|Blessing ceremony]] (sometimes called a "mass wedding") in [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The total number of couples who took part was 2075, some coming from other countries.  Soon after other American members were married in ceremonies in South Korea. Most who took part were matched with their future spouses by Moon.  Many couples were international or interracial. Before this most American church members had been single and living [[Celibacy|celibately]].&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, 2000, pages 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Moon's practice of matching couples was very unusual in both Christian tradition and in modern Western culture and attracted much attention and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;The men and women entered a large room, where Moon began matching couples by pointing at them."[http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/sides-moon-marriages-article-1.267920 NY Daily News]  "In the Unification tradition, romantic liaisons are forbidden until the members are deemed by Mr. Moon to be spiritually ready to be matched at a huge gathering where he points future spouses out to one another. His followers believe that his decisions are based on his ability to discern their suitability and see their future descendants. Many are matched with people of other races and nationalities, in keeping with Mr. Moon's ideal of unifying all races and nations in the Unification Church.  Though some couples are matched immediately before the mass wedding ceremonies, which are held every two or three years, most have long engagements during which they are typically posted in different cities or even continents, and get to know one another through letters."[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/22/nyregion/look-life-after-mass-marriage-for-2075-couples-give-take-200-10-years-together.html?pagewanted=all NY Times] "Many were personally matched by Moon, who taught that romantic love led to sexual promiscuity, mismatched couples and dysfunctional societies. Moon's preference for cross-cultural marriages also meant that couples often shared no common language."[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/03/moonies-mass-wedding-south-korea-unification-church-hak-ja-han-sun-myung-moon Manchester Guardian]  "Moon's death Sept. 2 and funeral Saturday signaled the end of the random pairings that helped make Moon's Unification Church famous — and infamous — a generation ago."

It led to some strange pairs such as a 71-year-old African Catholic archbishop who wed a 43-year-old Korean acupuncturist. In 1988 Moon entered the Guinness Book of Records when he married 6,516 identically dressed couples at Seoul's Olympic Stadium. Moonie newly-weds were forbidden to sleep together for 40 days to prove their marriage was on a higher plane. They then had to consummate their marriage in a three-day ritual with the sexual positions stipulated by their leader."[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-the-sinister-moonie-cult-how-1301689 Daily Mirror]&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of couples have been placed in marriages by religious leaders with people they had barely met, since Moon taught that romantic love led to sexual promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands marry in first Moonie wedding since founder's death|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/thousands-marry-in-first-moonie-wedding-since-founders-death-8498419.html|accessdate=20 May 2017|agency=Independent|date=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[Blessing ceremony of the Unification Church|mass arranged marriage events]] have gained international public attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Mark|title=I got married in a Moonie mass wedding: He was a public schoolboy from a wealthy family.

On May 1, 1994 (the 40th anniversary of the founding of the [[Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity]] (HSA-UWC) in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]), Moon declared that the era of the HSA-UWC had ended and inaugurated a new organization: the [[Family Federation for World Peace and Unification]] (FFWPU). The FFWPU would include members of various religious organizations working toward common goals, especially on issues of sexual morality and reconciliation between people of different religions, nations, and races. The FFWPU co-sponsored the [[Million Family March]] in 2000, the [[Global Peace Festival]] in the late 2000s (decade), and [[Blessing Ceremony of the Unification Church|blessing ceremonies]] in which thousands of married couples of different faith backgrounds were given the marriage blessing previously given only to HSA-UWC members.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, 2000, pages 47–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_30_117/ai_67151478 Thousands rally at million family march - racially and religiously diverse gathering], [[Christian Century]], 2000-11-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
In 2001 the [[United States Army]], in a handbook for [[chaplain]]s, reported that the [[Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity]] emphasizes the responsibility of [[citizenship]] but sets no official rules as to [[military service]]."  It added that HSA-UWC members have no restrictions on diet, uniform appearance, medical treatment, or other factors which might conflict with military requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Religious Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains, By U.

==Neologisms==

The Unification Church of the United States has introduced a number of [[neologism]]s into the English language, directly or indirectly. These include the derogatory term "[[Moonie (nickname)|Moonies]]",&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/moonie?view=uk Oxford English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/moonie WordNet® 3.0, © 2006 by Princeton University]&lt;/ref&gt; a special use of the word "[[Indemnity in the Unification Church|indemnity]]",&lt;ref&gt;Daske, D. and Ashcraft, W. 2005, ''New Religious Movements'', New York: New York University Press, {{ISBN|0-8147-0702-5}} "To restart the process toward perfection, God has sent messiahs to earth who could restore the true state of humanity's relationship with God. Before that can happen, however, humans must perform good deeds that cancel the bad effects of sin. Unificationists call this "indemnity". Showing love and devotion to one's fellow humans, especially within families, helps pay this indemnity." p142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, J. 1995, ''Unification Church'', Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Press, {{ISBN|0-310-70381-6}} "The doctrine of indemnity. Indemnity is that which people do to restore themselves to God's kingdom. Young Oon Kim describes it this way: 'We atone for our sins through specific acts of penance.' Kwang-Yol Yoo, a Unification teacher, even goes so far as to say that by following the ''Divine Principle'', 'man's perfection must be accomplished by his own effort without God's help.' God does most of the work, but people must still do their part in order to achieve God's plan of salvation: 'Five percent is only to say that man's responsibility is extremely small compared to God's.' "p35 "The doctrine of indemnity is not biblical. 'In simple language.' states Ruth Tucker, 'indemnity is salvation by works.' Bob Larson makes a distinction between Moon's doctrine and biblical theology, saying, 'Moon's doctrine of sinless perfection by "indemnity [forgiveness of sin by works on Moon's behalf], which can apply even to deceased ancestors, is a denial of the salvation by grace offering through Jesus Christ.' 'Farewell,' said John Calvin. 'to the dream of those who think up a righteousness flowing together out of faith and works.'" p40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tingle, D. and Fordyce, R. 1979, ''The Phases and Faces of the Moon: A Critical Examination of the Unification Church and Its Principles'', Hicksville, New York: Exposition Press p53-55 "In short, indemnity is anything you want to make it, since you establish the conditions. The zeal and enthusiasm of the Unification Church members is not so much based on love for God as it is compulsion to indemnify one's own sins."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unification.net/misc/powerdp.html THE POWER OF THE PRINCIPLE: WHENCE IT CAME; WHERE IT WENT] Richard Quebedeaux, "Rev. Moon calls such a mode of living, such a lifestyle, "restoration through indemnity." With indemnity viewed as a persistent pattern of behavior, not as a mere doctrine to be affirmed or a rational list of rules, God's ideal for human relationships is "restored" through restitution. Restitution-in the sense of a "natural law"-assuages resentment, because it is the means by which the powerful and enfranchised give the people who feel downtrodden and powerless what they believe is rightly theirs. Indemnity means that "I'm here for you."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/unificationism/edp-restoration.html%23Part2&amp;date=2009-10-25+23:34:40 ''Exposition of the Divine Principle'' 1996 Translation]&lt;/ref&gt; and the expressions "[[True Parents]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tparents.org/Moon-Talks/sunmyungmoon98/SM980914-NewYorker.htm Moon At Twilight: Amid scandal, the Unification Church has a strange new mission], [[Peter Maass]] ''[[New Yorker Magazine]]'', September 14, 1998.

[[Image:New TDS Patch.jpg|thumb|right|Shoulder sleeve insignia of USATDS]]
The '''United States Army Trial Defense Service''' (USATDS or TDS) is an independent Field Operating Agency within the US Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps]], and is part of the US Army Legal Services Agency (USALSA). The TDS motto is "Defending Those Who Defend America."

A Judge Advocate Colonel heads the Trial Defense Service Office of the Chief, located in [[Fort Belvoir]]. TDS consists of the Chief, TDS, the Executive Officer, the Chief of Defense Counsel Assistance Program, several training attorneys, a Senior Legal Administrator Warrant Officer, a Senior Enlisted Paralegal, three administrative staff, and nearly 240 TDS personnel worldwide. Under the Chief of TDS, there are nine Regional Defense Counsel (RDC) responsible for overseeing defense services within a geographic region (see below). Each RDC oversees several Senior Defense Counsel (SDC), who manage field offices with the responsibility of providing defense services for a specific post, command, or area. Some field offices oversee geographically separate branch offices.

AR 27-10 attaches all TDS attorneys to the Trial Defense Service with duty at a particular installation and requires the commander of the installation or organization and the respective SJA or supporting legal office to provide administrative and logistical support to defense counsel assigned to the installation, regardless of the lack of a command relationship.

The bulk of TDS is made up of US Army Reserve attorneys and paralegals. The reserve component of the Trial Defense Service consists of the 16th Legal Operations Detachment, the 22nd Legal Operations Detachment and the 154th Legal Operations Detachment. The 16th LOD is responsible for reserve TDS services east of the Mississippi and north of the Mason Dixon line, and in Germany; the 22nd LOD is responsible for reserve TDS services west of the [[Mississippi River]], Alaska, Hawaii and South Korea; and the 154th LOD is responsible for TDS service east of the Mississippi and south of the Mason Dixon line, and in Puerto Rico. The LODs are divided into distinct regions that are spread throughout their areas of responsibility.

==Mission==

The Trial Defense Service provides conflict-free legal services to soldiers who are facing adverse criminal or administrative actions at no cost to the soldier. Unlike public defenders in civilian jurisdictions, there is no means test required to determine eligibility; all soldiers are entitled to TDS representation by virtue of being subject to the UCMJ. The various categories of representation fall into three priorities.

* Priority 1: Criminal representation at trials by [[Courts-martial in the United States|court-martial]] is the top priority of TDS and takes precedence over all other actions. Defense Counsel make motions, [[voir dire]] the panel, offer [[evidence]], examine and [[cross-examine]] [[witnesses]], present argument, and negotiate on their client's behalf.
* Priority 2: Assistance with administrative separations (actions to discharge soldiers prior to the end of their service), [[Nonjudicial punishment|non-judicial punishment]]s, and summary courts-martial.
* Priority 3: All other actions, including advising soldiers of their rights as a [[suspect]] and responding to letters of reprimand. Priority 3 actions may also be handled by legal assistance attorneys, depending on the availability of TDS.

==History==
[[Image:Old TDS Patch.svg|thumb|right|The former insignia of TDS.]] 
In the Army military justice system, the main decision maker is the general court-martial [[Convening authority (court-martial)|convening authority]] (GCMCA), usually a division, post, or area commander. Each GCMCA has a Staff Judge Advocate, who serves as the legal advisor to the general. The Staff Judge Advocate also supervises a number of subordinate attorneys assigned to his or her particular unit. Collectively, the attorneys assigned to a particular command are called the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate.

Prior to the late 1970s, the duty of defense counsel was just another assignment within the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, much like the trial counsel (military prosecutor). To some, this created the appearance of a conflict of interest when two opposing counsel worked within the same office. To others, especially some soldier clients, the fact that their defense counsel wore the same unit patch as the prosecuting attorney and worked in the same building created the impression that their attorney was on the general's side and not theirs.

Between 1978 and 1980, the Army Chief of Staff approved an experimental program to determine whether it would be feasible to create a separate command solely for Army defense counsel. The pilot program was deemed a success, and in December 1980, the Trial Defense Service was born.

Because of the limited number of TDS attorneys (even the Army's largest installation, has only about 10 TDS attorneys), the TDS organization was originally not large enough to have its own unit patch ([[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder sleeve insignia]]). For 25 years, the TDS "unit patch" was [[World War II]]-vintage patch of the [[Army Service Forces]]. This patch had come to be designated the Department of the Army Staff Support patch and is worn by Department of the Army field operating agencies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/ArmyDUISSICOA/ArmyHeraldryUnit.aspx?u=2909 DA Staff Support] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610162642/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/ArmyDUISSICOA/ArmyHeraldryUnit.aspx?u=2909 |date=10 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the US Army Safety Center and the Defense Commissary Agency. In August 2006, however, a distinctive unit patch for TDS was approved for wear. From the Institute of Heraldry's description: "The shield-shaped patch reflects the nature of legal defense work. The sword supporting scales of justice represents the unit's mission to defend soldiers at courts-martial and separations boards; seeking justice for all soldiers. The sword also signifies that Trial Defense Service personnel are soldiers as well as lawyers. The glory, mullet, and the red border are adapted from the Department of the Army Staff Support patch previously authorized for wear by the Trial Defense Service, and provides a historical link to its organizational heritage."  [[Image:Southern Iraq Branch Office.jpg|thumb|right|The former Southern Iraq TDS branch office on COB Adder in Tallil.]]
[[File:OCP TDS Patch.jpg|thumb|left|Operation Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern (OCP "Multicam") patch.]]
On Memorial Day, 28 May 2012, the U.S. Army Trial Defense Service, CENTCOM Region, officially inaugurated the U.S. Army Trial Defense Service (TDS) Operation Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern (OCP "Multicam") patch.  The Department of the Army approved the OCP TDS patch as an official Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (SSI) for the Multicam uniform.

'''''What on Earth Have I Done Wrong?!''''' is a 2007 Taiwanese comedy film directed, co-written, and co-produced by [[Doze Niu]], starring himself as struggling film director-producer "Doze Niu", in his feature film debut.

'''William I'''{{efn|[[Old Norman]]: ''Williame I''; {{lang-ang|Willelm I}}}} ([[circa|c.]] 1028&lt;ref name=Bates33&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– 9&amp;nbsp;September 1087), usually known as '''William the Conqueror''' and sometimes '''William the Bastard''',&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt;{{efn|He was regularly described as ''bastardus'' (bastard) in non-Norman contemporary sources.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;}} was the first [[Normans|Norman]] [[King of England]], reigning from 1066 until his death in 1087. A descendant of [[Rollo]], he was [[Duke of Normandy]] from 1035 onward. After a long struggle to establish his power, by 1060 his hold on [[Normandy]] was secure, and he launched the [[Norman conquest of England]] six years later. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands and by difficulties with his eldest son.

William was the son of the unmarried [[Robert I, Duke of Normandy]], by Robert's mistress [[Herleva]]. His [[illegitimate]] status and his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy that plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke and for their own ends. In 1047 William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to [[Matilda of Flanders]] provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring [[county of Flanders]]. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointment of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and by 1062 William secured control of the neighbouring county of [[Maine (province)|Maine]].

In the 1050s and early 1060s William became a contender for the throne of England, then held by the childless [[Edward the Confessor]], his [[first cousin once removed]]. There were other potential claimants, including the powerful English earl [[Harold Godwinson]], who was named the next king by Edward on the latter's deathbed in January 1066. William argued that Edward had previously promised the throne to him and that Harold had sworn to support William's claim. William built a large fleet and invaded England in September 1066, decisively defeating and killing Harold at the [[Battle of Hastings]] on 14 October 1066. After further military efforts William was crowned king on Christmas Day 1066, in London. He made arrangements for the governance of England in early 1067 before returning to Normandy. Several unsuccessful rebellions followed, but by 1075 William's hold on England was mostly secure, allowing him to spend the majority of the rest of his reign on the continent.

William's final years were marked by difficulties in his continental domains, troubles with his eldest son, and threatened invasions of England by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]. In 1086 William ordered the compilation of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'', a survey listing all the landholdings in England along with their pre-Conquest and current holders. William died in September 1087 while leading a campaign in northern France, and was buried in [[Caen]]. His reign in England was marked by the construction of castles, the settling of a new Norman nobility on the land, and change in the composition of the English clergy. He did not try to integrate his various domains into one empire but instead continued to administer each part separately. William's lands were divided after his death: Normandy went to his eldest son, [[Robert Curthose]], and his second surviving son, [[William Rufus]], received England.

== Background ==

[[Viking|Norsemen]] first began raiding in what became [[Normandy]] in the late 8th century. Permanent Scandinavian settlement occurred before 911, when [[Rollo]], one of the Viking leaders, and King [[Charles the Simple]] of France reached an agreement surrendering the [[county of Rouen]] to Rollo. The lands around Rouen became the core of the later duchy of Normandy.&lt;ref name=Collins376&gt;Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 376–377&lt;/ref&gt; Normandy may have been used as a base when Scandinavian attacks on England were renewed at the end of the 10th century, which would have worsened relations between England and Normandy.&lt;ref name=Williams42&gt;Williams ''Æthelred the Unready'' pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to improve matters, King [[Æthelred the Unready]] took [[Emma of Normandy]], sister of Duke [[Richard II of Normandy|Richard II]], as his second wife in 1002.&lt;ref name=Williams54&gt;Williams ''Æthelred the Unready'' pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;

Danish raids on England continued, and Æthelred sought help from Richard, taking refuge in Normandy in 1013 when King [[Swein Forkbeard|Swein I of Denmark]] drove Æthelred and his family from England. Swein's death in 1014 allowed Æthelred to return home, but Swein's son [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] contested Æthelred's return. Æthelred died unexpectedly in 1016, and Cnut became king of England. Æthelred and Emma's two sons, [[Edward the Confessor|Edward]] and [[Alfred Aetheling|Alfred]], went into exile in Normandy while their mother, Emma, became Cnut's second wife.&lt;ref name=Conquest80&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 80–83&lt;/ref&gt;

After Cnut's death in 1035, the English throne fell to [[Harold Harefoot]], his son by his first wife, while [[Harthacnut]], his son by Emma, became king in Denmark. England remained unstable. Alfred returned to England in 1036 to visit his mother and perhaps to challenge Harold as king. One story implicates Earl [[Godwin of Wessex]] in Alfred's subsequent death, but others blame Harold. Emma went into exile in [[Flanders]] until Harthacnut became king following Harold's death in 1040, and his half-brother Edward followed Harthacnut to England; Edward was proclaimed king after Harthacnut's death in June 1042.&lt;ref name=Conquest83&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 83–85&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Although the chronicler William of Poitiers claimed that Edward's succession was due to Duke William's efforts, this is highly unlikely, as William was at that time practically powerless in his own duchy.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;}}

== Early life ==
[[File:Falaise Chateau Guillaume Conquerant 1.jpg|thumb|[[Château de Falaise]] in [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]], [[Lower Normandy]], France; William was born in an earlier building here.]]

William was born in 1027 or 1028 at [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]], Duchy of Normandy, most likely towards the end of 1028.&lt;ref name=Bates33/&gt;&lt;ref name=Official&gt;"[http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensofEngland/TheNormans/WilliamItheConqueror.aspx William the Conqueror]" ''History of the Monarchy''&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The exact date of William's birth is confused by contradictory statements by the Norman chroniclers. [[Orderic Vitalis]] has William on his deathbed claim that he was 64 years old, which would place his birth around 1023. But elsewhere, Orderic states that William was 8 years old when his father left for Jerusalem in 1035, placing the year of birth in 1027. [[William of Malmesbury]] gives an age of 7 for William when his father left, giving 1028. Another source, ''[[De Obitu Willelmi]]'', states that William was 59 years old when he died in 1087, allowing for either 1028 or 1029.&lt;ref name=Douglas379&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 379–382&lt;/ref&gt;}}  He was the only son of [[Robert I, Duke of Normandy|Duke Robert I]], son of [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy|Duke Richard II]].{{efn|This made Emma of Normandy his great-aunt and Edward the Confessor his cousin.&lt;ref name=Douglas417&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Douglas420&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;}}  His mother, Herleva, was the daughter of [[Fulbert of Falaise]]; Fulbert may have been a tanner or embalmer.&lt;ref name=Douglas379 /&gt; She was possibly a member of the ducal household, but did not marry Robert.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Instead, she later married [[Herluin de Conteville]], with whom she had two sons&amp;nbsp;– [[Odo of Bayeux]] and [[Robert, Count of Mortain]]&amp;nbsp;– and a daughter whose name is unknown.{{efn|This daughter later married William, lord of [[La Ferté-Macé]].&lt;ref name=Douglas379/&gt;}} One of Herleva's brothers, Walter, became a supporter and protector of William during his minority.&lt;ref name=Douglas379/&gt;{{efn|Walter had two daughters. One became a nun, and the other, Matilda, married [[Ralph Tesson]].&lt;ref name=Douglas379/&gt;}}  Robert also had a daughter, [[Adelaide of Normandy|Adelaide]], by another mistress.&lt;ref name=Houts19&gt;van Houts "Les femmes" ''Tabularia "Études"'' pp. 19–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert became Duke of Normandy on 6 August 1027, succeeding his elder brother [[Richard III, Duke of Normandy|Richard III]], who had only succeeded to the title the previous year.&lt;ref name=Bates33/&gt; Robert and his brother had been at odds over the succession, and Richard's death was sudden. Robert was accused by some writers of killing his brother, a plausible but now unprovable charge.&lt;ref name=Douglas31&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions in Normandy were unsettled, as noble families despoiled the Church and [[Alan III of Brittany]] waged war against the duchy, possibly in an attempt to take control. By 1031 Robert had gathered considerable support from noblemen, many of whom would become prominent during William's life. They included Robert's uncle, [[Robert II (Archbishop of Rouen)|Robert]] the [[archbishop of Rouen]], who had originally opposed the duke, [[Osbern the Steward|Osbern]], a nephew of [[Gunnora, Duchess of Normandy|Gunnor]] the wife of Duke Richard I, and Count [[Gilbert, Count of Brionne|Gilbert of Brionne]], a grandson of Richard I.&lt;ref name=Douglas32&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 32–34, 145&lt;/ref&gt; After his accession, Robert continued Norman support for the English princes Edward and Alfred, who were still in exile in northern France.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

There are indications that Robert may have been briefly betrothed to a daughter of King Cnut, but no marriage took place. It is unclear if William would have been supplanted in the ducal succession if Robert had had a legitimate son. Earlier dukes had been [[illegitimate]], and William's association with his father on ducal charters appears to indicate that William was considered Robert's most likely heir.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; In 1034 Duke Robert decided to go on [[pilgrimage]] to [[Jerusalem]]. Although some of his supporters tried to dissuade him from undertaking the journey, Robert convened a council in January 1035 and had the assembled Norman magnates swear [[fealty]] to William as his heir&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Douglas35/&gt; before leaving for Jerusalem. He died in early July at [[İznik|Nicea]], on his way back to Normandy.&lt;ref name=Douglas35&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 35–37&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges ===
[[File:Tree of William I struggle for Normandy.svg|thumb|upright=3.4|Diagram showing William's family relationships. Names with "---" under them were opponents of William, and names with "+++" were supporters of William. Some relatives switched sides over time, and are marked with both symbols.]]
William faced several challenges on becoming duke, including his illegitimate birth and his youth: the evidence indicates that he was either seven or eight years old at the time.&lt;ref name=Bates36&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Douglas37&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|How illegitimacy was viewed by the church and lay society was undergoing a change during this period. The Church, under the influence of the [[Gregorian reform]], held the view that the sin of extramarital sex tainted any offspring that resulted, but nobles had not totally embraced the Church's viewpoint during William's lifetime.&lt;ref name=Crouch132&gt;Crouch ''Birth of Nobility'' pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt; By 1135 the illegitimate birth of [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]], son of William's son [[Henry I of England]], was enough to bar Robert's succession as king when Henry died without legitimate male heirs, even though he had some support from the English nobility.&lt;ref name=Bastards42&gt;Given-Wilson and Curteis ''Royal Bastards'' p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;}} He enjoyed the support of his great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as the king of France, [[Henry I of France|Henry I]], enabling him to succeed to his father's duchy.&lt;ref name=Douglas38 /&gt; The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue his father's policies,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; but Archbishop Robert's death in March 1037 removed one of William's main supporters, and conditions in Normandy quickly descended into chaos.&lt;ref name=Douglas38&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

The anarchy in the duchy lasted until 1047,&lt;ref name=Douglas51&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; and control of the young duke was one of the priorities of those contending for power. At first, Alan of Brittany had custody of the duke, but when Alan died in either late 1039 or October 1040, Gilbert of Brionne took charge of William. Gilbert was killed within months, and another guardian, Turchetil, was also killed around the time of Gilbert's death.&lt;ref name=Douglas40&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another guardian, Osbern, was slain in the early 1040s in William's chamber while the duke slept. It was said that Walter, William's maternal uncle, was occasionally forced to hide the young duke in the houses of peasants,&lt;ref name=Bates37&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; although this story may be an embellishment by [[Orderic Vitalis]]. The historian Eleanor Searle speculates that William was raised with the three cousins who later became important in his career&amp;nbsp;– [[William fitzOsbern]], [[Roger de Beaumont]], and [[Roger of Montgomery]].&lt;ref name=Searle196&gt;Searle ''Predatory Kinship'' pp. 196–198&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of the Norman nobles engaged in their own private wars and feuds during William's minority, the viscounts still acknowledged the ducal government, and the ecclesiastical hierarchy was supportive of William.&lt;ref name=Douglas42&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Colonne Vimont.jpg|thumb|left|Column at the site of the [[Battle of Val-ès-Dunes]]]]

King Henry continued to support the young duke,&lt;ref name=Douglas45&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; but in late 1046 opponents of William came together in a rebellion centred in lower Normandy, led by [[Guy of Burgundy]] with support from Nigel, Viscount of the Cotentin, and Ranulf, Viscount of the Bessin. According to stories that may have legendary elements, an attempt was made to seize William at Valognes, but he escaped under cover of darkness, seeking refuge with King Henry.&lt;ref name=Douglas47&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 47–49&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1047 Henry and William returned to Normandy and were victorious at the [[Battle of Val-ès-Dunes]] near [[Caen]], although few details of the actual fighting are recorded.&lt;ref name=Bates38&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; William of Poitiers claimed that the battle was won mainly through William's efforts, but earlier accounts claim that King Henry's men and leadership also played an important part.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; William assumed power in Normandy, and shortly after the battle promulgated the [[Peace and Truce of God#Truce of God|Truce of God]] throughout his duchy, in an effort to limit warfare and violence by restricting the days of the year on which fighting was permitted.&lt;ref name=Bates40&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes marked a turning point in William's control of the duchy, it was not the end of his struggle to gain the upper hand over the nobility. The period from 1047 to 1054 saw almost continuous warfare, with lesser crises continuing until 1060.&lt;ref name=Douglas53&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consolidation of power ===
William's next efforts were against Guy of Burgundy, who retreated to his castle at [[Brionne]], which William besieged. After a long effort, the duke succeeded in exiling Guy in 1050.&lt;ref name=Douglas54&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; To address the growing power of the Count of [[Anjou]], [[Geoffrey Martel]],&lt;ref name=Douglas56/&gt; William joined with King Henry in a campaign against him, the last known cooperation between the two. They succeeded in capturing an Angevin fortress, but accomplished little else.&lt;ref name=Bates43&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffrey attempted to expand his authority into the county of [[Maine (province)|Maine]], especially after the death of [[Hugh IV of Maine]] in 1051. Central to the control of Maine were the holdings of the [[Bellême family]], who held [[Bellême]] on the border of Maine and Normandy, as well as the fortresses at [[Alençon]] and [[Domfront, Orne|Domfront]]. Bellême's overlord was the king of France, but Domfort was under the overlordship of Geoffrey Martel and Duke William was Alençon's overlord. The Bellême family, whose lands were quite strategically placed between their three different overlords, were able to play each of them against the other and secure virtual independence for themselves.&lt;ref name=Douglas56&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 56–58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bayeuxtapestryodowilliamrobert.jpg|thumb|Image from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] showing William with his half-brothers. William is in the centre, Odo is on the left with empty hands, and Robert is on the right with a sword in his hand.]]

On the death of Hugh of Maine, Geoffrey Martel occupied Maine in a move contested by William and King Henry; eventually, they succeeded in driving Geoffrey from the county, and in the process, William was able to secure the Bellême family strongholds at Alençon and Domfort for himself. He was thus able to assert his overlordship over the Bellême family and compel them to act consistently in Norman interests.&lt;ref name=Douglas59&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1052 the king and Geoffrey Martel made common cause against William at the same time as some Norman nobles began to contest William's increasing power. Henry's about-face was probably motivated by a desire to retain dominance over Normandy, which was now threatened by William's growing mastery of his duchy.&lt;ref name=Douglas63&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; William was engaged in military actions against his own nobles throughout 1053,&lt;ref name=Douglas66&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with the new Archbishop of Rouen, [[Mauger (archbishop)|Mauger]].&lt;ref name=Douglas64&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1054 the king and the Norman rebels launched a double invasion of the duchy. Henry led the main thrust through the [[Count of Évreux|county of Évreux]], while the other wing, under the French king's brother [[Odo (son of Robert II of France)|Odo]], invaded eastern Normandy.&lt;ref name=Douglas67&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

William met the invasion by dividing his forces into two groups. The first, which he led, faced Henry. The second, which included some who became William's firm supporters, such as [[Counts of Eu|Robert, Count of Eu]], [[Walter Giffard, Lord of Longueville|Walter Giffard]], [[Roger of Mortemer]], and [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey|William de Warenne]], faced the other invading force. This second force defeated the invaders at the [[Battle of Mortemer]]. In addition to ending both invasions, the battle allowed the duke's ecclesiastical supporters to depose Mauger from the archbishopric of Rouen. Mortemer thus marked another turning point in William's growing control of the duchy,&lt;ref name=Douglas68&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; although his conflict with the French king and the Count of Anjou continued until 1060.&lt;ref name=Douglas75&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; Henry and Geoffrey led another invasion of Normandy in 1057 but were defeated by William at the [[Battle of Varaville]]. This was the last invasion of Normandy during William's lifetime.&lt;ref name=Bates50/&gt; In 1058, William invaded the [[County of Dreux]] and took [[Tillières-sur-Avre]] and [[Thimert]]. Henry attempted to dislodge William, but the [[Siege of Thimert]] dragged on for two years until Henry's death.&lt;ref name=Bates50&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The deaths of Count Geoffrey and the king in 1060 cemented the shift in the balance of power towards William.&lt;ref name=Bates50/&gt;

[[File:Acrdwnch.jpg|thumb|left|The signatures of William I and Matilda are the first two large crosses on the [[Accord of Winchester]] from 1072.]]

One factor in William's favour was his marriage to [[Matilda of Flanders]], the daughter of Count [[Baldwin V of Flanders]]. The union was arranged in 1049, but Pope [[Pope Leo IX|Leo IX]] forbade the marriage at the [[Council of Rheims]] in October 1049.{{efn|The reasons for the prohibition are not clear. There is no record of the reason from the Council, and the main evidence is from Orderic Vitalis. He hinted obliquely that William and Matilda were [[Affinity (canon law)|too closely related]], but gave no details, hence the matter remains obscure.&lt;ref name=Douglas391-&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 391–393&lt;/ref&gt;}} The marriage nevertheless went ahead some time in the early 1050s,&lt;ref name=Douglas76&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The exact date of the marriage is unknown, but it was probably in 1051 or 1052, and certainly before the end of 1053, as Matilda is named as William's wife in a [[charter]] dated in the later part of that year.&lt;ref name=Douglas391&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 391&lt;/ref&gt;}} possibly unsanctioned by the pope. According to a late source not generally considered to be reliable, papal sanction was not secured until 1059, but as papal-Norman relations in the 1050s were generally good, and Norman clergy were able to visit Rome in 1050 without incident, it was probably secured earlier.&lt;ref name=Bates44&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; Papal sanction of the marriage appears to have required the founding of two monasteries in Caen&amp;nbsp;– one by William and one by Matilda.&lt;ref name=Douglas80&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The two monasteries are the [[Abbaye-aux-Hommes]] (or St Étienne) for men which was founded by William in about 1059, and the [[Abbaye aux Dames]] (or Sainte Trinité) for women which was founded by Matilda around four years later.&lt;ref name=Bates66&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt;}} The marriage was important in bolstering William's status, as Flanders was one of the more powerful French territories, with ties to the French royal house and to the German emperors.&lt;ref name=Bates44/&gt; Contemporary writers considered the marriage, which produced four sons and five or six daughters, to be a success.&lt;ref name=Douglas393/&gt;

=== Appearance and character ===
No authentic portrait of William has been found; the contemporary depictions of him on the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] and on his seals and coins are conventional representations designed to assert his authority.&lt;ref name=Bates115&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; There are some written descriptions of a burly and robust appearance, with a guttural voice. He enjoyed excellent health until old age, although he became quite fat in later life.&lt;ref name=Douglas368&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 368–369&lt;/ref&gt; He was strong enough to draw bows that others were unable to pull and had great stamina.&lt;ref name=Bates115/&gt; Geoffrey Martel described him as without equal as a fighter and as a horseman.&lt;ref name=Searle203&gt;Searle ''Predatory Kinship'' p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Examination of William's [[femur]], the only bone to survive when the rest of his remains were destroyed, showed he was approximately {{convert|5|ft|10|in|m}} in height.&lt;ref name=Bates115/&gt;

There are records of two tutors for the young duke during the late 1030s and early 1040s, but the extent of William's literary education is unclear. He was not known as a patron of authors, and there is little evidence that he sponsored scholarship or other intellectual activities.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Orderic Vitalis records that William tried to learn to read [[Old English]] late in life, but he was unable to devote sufficient time to the effort and quickly gave up.&lt;ref name=Huscroft323&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; William's main hobby appears to have been hunting. His marriage to Matilda appears to have been quite affectionate, and there are no signs that he was unfaithful to her&amp;nbsp;– unusual in a medieval monarch. Medieval writers criticised William for his greed and cruelty, but his personal piety was universally praised by contemporaries.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

=== Norman administration ===

Norman government under William was similar to the government that had existed under earlier dukes. It was a fairly simple administrative system, built around the ducal household,&lt;ref name=Bates133&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of a group of officers including [[Butler|stewards]], [[butler]]s, and [[marshal]]ls.&lt;ref name=Bates23&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; The duke travelled constantly around the duchy, confirming [[charter]]s and collecting revenues.&lt;ref name=Bates63&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the income came from the ducal lands, as well as from tolls and a few taxes. This income was collected by the chamber, one of the household departments.&lt;ref name=Bates23/&gt;

William cultivated close relations with the church in his duchy. He took part in church councils and made several appointments to the Norman episcopate, including the appointment of [[Maurilius]] as Archbishop of Rouen.&lt;ref name=Bates64/&gt; Another important appointment was that of William's half-brother Odo as [[Bishop of Bayeux]] in either 1049 or 1050.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He also relied on the clergy for advice, including [[Lanfranc]], a non-Norman who rose to become one of William's prominent ecclesiastical advisors in the late 1040s and remained so throughout the 1050s and 1060s. William gave generously to the church;&lt;ref name=Bates64&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 64–66&lt;/ref&gt; from 1035 to 1066, the Norman aristocracy founded at least 20 new monastic houses, including William's 2 monasteries in Caen, a remarkable expansion of religious life in the duchy.&lt;ref name=Douglas111&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt;

== English and continental concerns ==
[[File:Tree of William's struggle for England.svg|thumb|upright=3.4|Family relationships of the claimants to the English throne in 1066, and others involved in the struggle. Kings of England are shown in '''bold'''.]]

In 1051 the childless King Edward of England appears to have chosen William as his successor to the English throne.&lt;ref name=Barlow&gt;Barlow "Edward" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; William was the grandson of Edward's maternal uncle, [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy]].&lt;ref name=Barlow /&gt; The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', in the "D" version, states that William visited England in the later part of 1051, perhaps to secure confirmation of the succession,&lt;ref name=Bates46/&gt; or perhaps William was attempting to secure aid for his troubles in Normandy.&lt;ref name=Huscroft93/&gt; The trip is unlikely given William's absorption in warfare with Anjou at the time. Whatever Edward's wishes, it was likely that any claim by William would be opposed by Godwin, the [[Earl of Wessex]], a member of the most powerful family in England.&lt;ref name=Bates46&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Edward had married [[Edith of Wessex|Edith]], Godwin's daughter, in 1043, and Godwin appears to have been one of the main supporters of Edward's claim to the throne.&lt;ref name=Huscroft86&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; By 1050, however, relations between the king and the earl had soured, culminating in a crisis in 1051 that led to the exile of Godwin and his family from England. It was during this exile that Edward offered the throne to William.&lt;ref name=Huscroft89&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin returned from exile in 1052 with armed forces, and a settlement was reached between the king and the earl, restoring the earl and his family to their lands and replacing [[Robert of Jumièges]], a Norman whom Edward had named [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], with [[Stigand]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]].&lt;ref name=Huscroft95&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; No English source mentions a supposed embassy by Archbishop Robert to William conveying the promise of the succession, and the two Norman sources that mention it, [[William of Jumièges]] and [[William of Poitiers]], are not precise in their chronology of when this visit took place.&lt;ref name=Huscroft93&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 93–95&lt;/ref&gt;

Count [[Herbert II of Maine]] died in 1062, and William, who had betrothed his eldest son [[Robert Curthose|Robert]] to Herbert's sister Margaret, claimed the county through his son. Local nobles resisted the claim, but William invaded and by 1064 had secured control of the area.&lt;ref name=Douglas174&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; William appointed a Norman to the [[Diocese of Le Mans|bishopric of Le Mans]] in 1065. He also allowed his son Robert Curthose to do homage to the new Count of Anjou, [[Geoffrey III, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey the Bearded]].&lt;ref name=Bates53&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; William's western border was thus secured, but his border with [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] remained insecure. In 1064 William invaded Brittany in a campaign that remains obscure in its details. Its effect, though, was to destabilise Brittany, forcing the duke, [[Conan II, Duke of Brittany|Conan II]], to focus on internal problems rather than on expansion. Conan's death in 1066 further secured William's borders in Normandy. William also benefited from his campaign in Brittany by securing the support of some Breton nobles who went on to support the invasion of England in 1066.&lt;ref name=Douglas178&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bayeuxtapestrywilliamgivesharoldarms.jpg|upright|thumb|Scene from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] whose text indicates William supplying weapons to Harold during Harold's trip to the continent in 1064]]

In England, Earl Godwin died in 1053 and his sons were increasing in power: [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] succeeded to his father's earldom, and another son, [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]], became [[Earl of Northumbria]]. Other sons were granted earldoms later: [[Gyrth Godwinson|Gyrth]] as [[Earl of East Anglia]] in 1057 and [[Leofwine Godwinson|Leofwine]] as [[Earl of Kent]] some time between 1055 and 1057.&lt;ref name=Huscroft98&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 98–100&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources claim that Harold took part in William's Breton campaign of 1064 and that Harold swore to uphold William's claim to the English throne at the end of the campaign,&lt;ref name=Bates53/&gt; but no English source reports this trip, and it is unclear if it actually occurred. It may have been Norman propaganda designed to discredit Harold, who had emerged as the main contender to succeed King Edward.&lt;ref name=Huscroft102&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 102–103&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, another contender for the throne had emerged&amp;nbsp;– [[Edward the Exile]], son of [[Edmund Ironside]] and a grandson of Æthelred II, returned to England in 1057, and although he died shortly after his return, he brought with him his family, which included two daughters, [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]] and [[Cristina, daughter of Edward the Exile|Christina]], and a son, [[Edgar the Ætheling]].&lt;ref name=Huscroft97&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Ætheling means "prince of the royal house" and usually denoted a son or brother of a ruling king.&lt;ref name=BASEAetheling&gt;Miller "Ætheling" ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1065 Northumbria revolted against Tostig, and the rebels chose [[Morcar]], the younger brother of [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin]], [[Earl of Mercia]], as earl in place of Tostig. Harold, perhaps to secure the support of Edwin and Morcar in his bid for the throne, supported the rebels and persuaded King Edward to replace Tostig with Morcar. Tostig went into exile in Flanders, along with his wife [[Judith of Flanders, Countess of Northumbria|Judith]], who was the daughter of Count [[Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders|Baldwin IV of Flanders]]. Edward was ailing, and he died on 5 January 1066. It is unclear what exactly happened at Edward's deathbed. One story, deriving from the ''[[Vita Ædwardi Regis|Vita Edwardi]]'', a biography of Edward, claims that Edward was attended by his wife Edith, Harold, Archbishop Stigand, and [[Robert FitzWimarc]], and that the king named Harold as his successor. The Norman sources do not dispute the fact that Harold was named as the next king, but they declare that Harold's oath and Edward's earlier promise of the throne could not be changed on Edward's deathbed. Later English sources stated that Harold had been elected as king by the clergy and magnates of England.&lt;ref name=Huscroft107&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 107–109&lt;/ref&gt;

== Invasion of England ==
{{Main article|Norman conquest of England}}

=== Harold's preparations ===
[[File:Norman-conquest-1066.svg|thumb|Locations of some of the events in 1066]]

Harold was crowned on 6 January 1066 in Edward's new [[Norman architecture|Norman-style]] [[Westminster Abbey]], although some controversy surrounds who performed the ceremony. English sources claim that [[Ealdred (bishop)|Ealdred]], the [[Archbishop of York]], performed the ceremony, while Norman sources state that the coronation was performed by Stigand, who was considered a non-canonical archbishop by the papacy.&lt;ref name=Huscroft115&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; Harold's claim to the throne was not entirely secure, however, as there were other claimants, perhaps including his exiled brother Tostig.&lt;ref name=Ruling12&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Edgar the Ætheling was another claimant,&lt;ref name=Bates78&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; but Edgar was young,&lt;ref name=Thomas18&gt;Thomas ''Norman Conquest'' p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; likely only 14 in 1066.&lt;ref name=Conquest132&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;}} King [[Harald Hardrada]] of Norway also had a claim to the throne as the uncle and heir of King [[Magnus I of Norway|Magnus I]], who had made a pact with Harthacnut in about 1040 that if either Magnus or Harthacnut died without heirs, the other would succeed.&lt;ref name=Huscroft118/&gt; The last claimant was William of Normandy, against whose anticipated invasion King Harold Godwinson made most of his preparations.&lt;ref name=Ruling12/&gt;

Harold's brother Tostig made probing attacks along the southern coast of England in May 1066, landing at the [[Isle of Wight]] using a fleet supplied by Baldwin of Flanders. Tostig appears to have received little local support, and further raids into [[Lincolnshire]] and near the [[River Humber]] met with no more success, so he retreated to Scotland, where he remained for a time. According to the Norman writer William of Jumièges, William had meanwhile sent an embassy to King Harold Godwinson to remind Harold of his oath to support William's claim, although whether this embassy actually occurred is unclear. Harold assembled an army and a fleet to repel William's anticipated invasion force, deploying troops and ships along the [[English Channel]] for most of the summer.&lt;ref name=Ruling12/&gt;

=== William's preparations ===
[[File:BayeuxTapestryScene37.jpg|left|thumb|Scene from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] showing Normans preparing for the invasion of England]]

William of Poitiers describes a council called by Duke William, in which the writer gives an account of a great debate that took place between William's nobles and supporters over whether to risk an invasion of England. Although some sort of formal assembly probably was held, it is unlikely that any debate took place, as the duke had by then established control over his nobles, and most of those assembled would have been anxious to secure their share of the rewards from the conquest of England.&lt;ref name=Bates79&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 79–81&lt;/ref&gt; William of Poitiers also relates that the duke obtained the consent of Pope [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]] for the invasion, along with a papal banner. The chronicler also claimed that the duke secured the support of Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and King [[Sweyn II of Denmark]]. Henry was still a minor, however, and Sweyn was more likely to support Harold, who could then help Sweyn against the Norwegian king, so these claims should be treated with caution. Although Alexander did give papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support prior to the invasion.{{efn|The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] may depict a papal banner carried by William's forces, but this is not named as such in the tapestry.&lt;ref name=Huscroft120/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Huscroft120&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 120–123&lt;/ref&gt; Events after the invasion, which included the penance William performed and statements by later popes, do lend circumstantial support to the claim of papal approval. To deal with Norman affairs, William put the government of Normandy into the hands of his wife for the duration of the invasion.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Throughout the summer, William assembled an army and an invasion fleet in Normandy. Although William of Jumièges's claim that the ducal fleet numbered 3,000 ships is clearly an exaggeration, it was probably large and mostly built from scratch. Although William of Poitiers and William of Jumièges disagree about where the fleet was built&amp;nbsp;– Poitiers states it was constructed at the mouth of the [[River Dives]], while Jumièges states it was built at [[Saint-Valery-sur-Somme]]&amp;nbsp;– both agree that it eventually sailed from Valery-sur-Somme. The fleet carried an invasion force that included, in addition to troops from William's own territories of Normandy and Maine, large numbers of mercenaries, allies, and volunteers from [[Brittany]], northeastern France, and Flanders, together with smaller numbers from other parts of Europe. Although the army and fleet were ready by early August, adverse winds kept the ships in Normandy until late September. There were probably other reasons for William's delay, including intelligence reports from England revealing that Harold's forces were deployed along the coast. William would have preferred to delay the invasion until he could make an unopposed landing.&lt;ref name=Huscroft120/&gt; Harold kept his forces on alert throughout the summer, but with the arrival of the harvest season he disbanded his army on 8&amp;nbsp;September.&lt;ref name=Carpenter72&gt;Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tostig and Hardrada's invasion ===
[[File:Battle Flat - geograph.org.uk - 285158.jpg|thumb|Modern day site of the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]]]]

Harold's brother Tostig and Harald Hardrada invaded [[Northumbria]] in September 1066 and defeated the local forces under Morcar and Edwin at the [[Battle of Fulford]] near [[York]]. King Harold received word of their invasion and marched north, defeating the invaders and killing Tostig and Hardrada on 25 September at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]].&lt;ref name=Huscroft118&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; The Norman fleet finally set sail two days later, landing in England at [[Pevensey Bay]] on 28 September. William then moved to [[Hastings]], a few miles to the east, where he built a castle as a base of operations. From there, he ravaged the interior and waited for Harold's return from the north, refusing to venture far from the sea, his line of communication with Normandy.&lt;ref name=Carpenter72/&gt;

=== Battle of Hastings ===
{{Main article|Battle of Hastings}}

After defeating Harald Hardrada and Tostig, Harold left much of his army in the north, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion.&lt;ref name=Carpenter72/&gt; He probably learned of William's landing while he was travelling south. Harold stopped in London, and was there for about a week before marching to Hastings, so it is likely that he spent about a week on his march south, averaging about {{convert|27|mi|km|abbr=off}} per day,&lt;ref name=Marren93&gt;Marren ''1066'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; for the distance of approximately {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=Huscroft124&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William's scouts reported the English arrival to the duke. The exact events preceding the battle are obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all agree that William led his army from his castle and advanced towards the enemy.&lt;ref name=Lawson180&gt;Lawson ''Battle of Hastings'' pp. 180–182&lt;/ref&gt; Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill (present-day [[Battle, East Sussex]]), about {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=off}} from William's castle at Hastings.&lt;ref name=Marren99&gt;Marren ''1066'' pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bayeux Tapestry Horses in Battle of Hastings.jpg|thumb|left|Scene from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] depicting the [[Battle of Hastings]].]]

The battle began at about 9&amp;nbsp;am on 14 October and lasted all day, but while a broad outline is known, the exact events are obscured by contradictory accounts in the sources.&lt;ref name=Huscroft126&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Although the numbers on each side were about equal, William had both cavalry and infantry, including many archers, while Harold had only foot soldiers and few, if any, archers.&lt;ref name=Carpenter73&gt;Carpenter  ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The English soldiers formed up as a [[shield wall]] along the ridge and were at first so effective that William's army was thrown back with heavy casualties. Some of William's [[Breton people|Breton]] troops panicked and fled, and some of the English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons until they themselves were attacked and destroyed by Norman cavalry. During the Bretons' flight, rumours swept through the Norman forces that the duke had been killed, but William succeeded in rallying his troops. Two further Norman retreats were feigned, to once again draw the English into pursuit and expose them to repeated attacks by the Norman cavalry.&lt;ref name=Huscroft127&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon, but it appears that the decisive event was Harold's death, about which differing stories are told. William of Jumièges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke. The Bayeux Tapestry has been claimed to show Harold's death by an arrow to the eye, but that may be a later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th-century stories in which Harold was slain by an arrow wound to the head.&lt;ref name=Huscroft129&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Harold's body was identified the day after the battle, either through his armour or marks on his body. The English dead, who included some of Harold's brothers and his [[housecarl]]s, were left on the battlefield. Gytha, Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke the weight of her son's body in gold for its custody, but her offer was refused.{{efn|[[William of Malmesbury]] states that William did accept Gytha's offer, but William of Poitiers states that William refused the offer.&lt;ref name=Godwine&gt;Williams "Godwine, earl of Wessex" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; Modern biographers of Harold agree that William refused the offer.&lt;ref name=Walker181&gt;Walker ''Harold'' p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rex254&gt;Rex ''Harold II'' p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;}} William ordered that Harold's body was to be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. [[Waltham Abbey (abbey)|Waltham Abbey]], which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his body had been secretly buried there.&lt;ref name=Huscroft131&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

=== March on London ===

William may have hoped the English would surrender following his victory, but they did not. Instead, some of the English clergy and magnates nominated Edgar the Ætheling as king, though their support for Edgar was only lukewarm. After waiting a short while, William secured [[Dover]], parts of Kent, and [[Canterbury]], while also sending a force to capture [[Winchester]], where the royal treasury was.&lt;ref name=Huscroft132/&gt; These captures secured William's rear areas and also his line of retreat to Normandy, if that was needed.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; William then marched to [[Southwark]], across the [[Thames]] from London, which he reached in late November. Next he led his forces around the south and west of London, burning along the way. He finally crossed the Thames at [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] in early December. Stigand submitted to William there, and when the duke moved on to [[Berkhamsted]] soon afterwards, Edgar the Ætheling, Morcar, Edwin, and Ealdred also submitted. William then sent forces into London to construct a castle; he was crowned at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.&lt;ref name=Huscroft132&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 131–133&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consolidation ==

=== First actions ===

William remained in England after his coronation and tried to reconcile the native magnates. The remaining earls&amp;nbsp;– Edwin (of Mercia), Morcar (of Northumbria), and [[Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria|Waltheof]] (of Northampton)&amp;nbsp;– were confirmed in their lands and titles.&lt;ref name=Huscroft138/&gt; Waltheof was married to William's niece Judith, daughter of Adelaide,&lt;ref name=Douglas423&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; and a marriage between Edwin and one of William's daughters was proposed. Edgar the Ætheling also appears to have been given lands. Ecclesiastical offices continued to be held by the same bishops as before the invasion, including the uncanonical Stigand.&lt;ref name=Huscroft138/&gt; But the families of Harold and his brothers lost their lands, as did some others who had fought against William at Hastings.&lt;ref name=Carpenter75/&gt; By March, William was secure enough to return to Normandy, but he took with him Stigand, Morcar, Edwin, Edgar, and Waltheof. He left his half-brother Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, in charge of England along with another influential supporter, [[William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford|William fitzOsbern]], the son of his former guardian.&lt;ref name=Huscroft138 /&gt; Both men were also named to earldoms&amp;nbsp;– fitzOsbern to Hereford (or Wessex) and Odo to Kent.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Although he put two Normans in overall charge, he retained many of the native English [[sheriff]]s.&lt;ref name=Carpenter75&gt;Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; Once in Normandy the new English king went to Rouen and the [[Abbey of Fecamp]],&lt;ref name=Huscroft138&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt; and then attended the consecration of new churches at two Norman monasteries.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

While William was in Normandy, a former ally, [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]], the [[Count of Boulogne]], invaded at [[Dover]] but was repulsed. English resistance had also begun, with [[Eadric the Wild]] attacking [[Hereford]] and revolts at [[Exeter]], where Harold's mother Gytha was a focus of resistance.&lt;ref name=Ruling57/&gt; FitzOsbern and Odo found it difficult to control the native population and undertook a programme of castle building to maintain their hold on the kingdom.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; William returned to England in December 1067 and marched on Exeter, which he besieged. The town held out for 18 days, and after it fell to William he built a castle to secure his control. Harold's sons were meanwhile raiding the southwest of England from a base in Ireland. Their forces landed near [[Bristol]] but were defeated by [[Eadnoth the Constable|Eadnoth]]. By Easter, William was at Winchester, where he was soon joined by his wife Matilda, who was crowned in May 1068.&lt;ref name=Ruling57&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English resistance ===
{{Main article|Harrying of the North}}
[[File:Baile Hill, York.JPG|The remains of [[Baile Hill]], the second [[motte-and-bailey castle]] built by William in York|thumb]]

In 1068 Edwin and Morcar revolted, supported by [[Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria|Gospatric]]. The chronicler Orderic Vitalis states that Edwin's reason for revolting was that the proposed marriage between himself and one of William's daughters had not taken place, but another reason probably included the increasing power of William fitzOsbern in Herefordshire, which affected Edwin's power within his own earldom. The king marched through Edwin's lands and built a castle at [[Warwick Castle|Warwick]]. Edwin and Morcar submitted, but William continued on to York, building castles at [[York Castle|York]] and [[Nottingham Castle|Nottingham]] before returning south. On his southbound journey, the king began constructing castles at [[Lincoln Castle|Lincoln]], [[Huntingdon Castle|Huntingdon]], and [[Cambridge Castle|Cambridge]]. William placed supporters in charge of these new fortifications&amp;nbsp;– among them [[William Peverel]] at Nottingham and [[Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick|Henry de Beaumont]] at Warwick. Then the king returned to Normandy late in 1068.&lt;ref name=Ruling57/&gt;

Early in 1069, Edgar the Ætheling rose in revolt and attacked York. Although William returned to York and built another castle, Edgar remained free, and in the autumn he joined up with King Sweyn of Denmark.{{efn|Medieval chroniclers frequently referred to 11th-century events only by the season, making more precise dating impossible.}} The Danish king had brought a large fleet to England and attacked not only York but Exeter and [[Shrewsbury]]. York was captured by the combined forces of Edgar and Sweyn. Edgar was proclaimed king by his supporters, but William responded swiftly, ignoring a continental revolt in Maine. William symbolically wore his crown in the ruins of York on Christmas Day 1069, and then proceeded to buy off the Danes. He marched to the [[River Tees]], ravaging the countryside as he went.  Edgar, having lost much of his support, fled to Scotland,&lt;ref name=Carpenter76/&gt; where King [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]] was married to Edgar's sister Margaret.&lt;ref name=Douglas225&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Waltheof, who had joined the revolt, submitted, along with Gospatric, and both were allowed to retain their lands. But William was not finished; he marched over the [[Pennines]] during the winter and defeated the remaining rebels at Shrewsbury before building castles at [[Chester Castle|Chester]] and [[Stafford Castle|Stafford]]. This campaign, which included the burning and destruction of part of the countryside that the royal forces marched through, is usually known as the "[[Harrying of the North]]"; it was over by April 1070, when William wore his crown ceremonially for Easter at Winchester.&lt;ref name=Carpenter76&gt;Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Church affairs ===

While at Winchester in 1070, William met with three [[papal legate]]s&amp;nbsp;– John Minutus, Peter, and Ermenfrid of Sion&amp;nbsp;– who had been sent by the pope. The legates ceremonially crowned William during the Easter court.&lt;ref name=Bates106/&gt; The historian [[David Bates (historian)|David Bates]] sees this coronation as the ceremonial papal "seal of approval" for William's conquest.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; The legates and the king then proceeded to hold a series of ecclesiastical councils dedicated to reforming and reorganising the English church. Stigand and his brother, [[Æthelmær of Elmham|Æthelmær]], the [[Bishop of Elmham]], were deposed from their bishoprics. Some of the native abbots were also deposed, both at the council held near Easter and at a further one near [[Whitsun]]. The Whitsun council saw the appointment of Lanfranc as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and [[Thomas of Bayeux]] as the new Archbishop of York, to replace Ealdred, who had died in September 1069.&lt;ref name=Bates106/&gt; William's half-brother Odo perhaps expected to be appointed to Canterbury, but William probably did not wish to give that much power to a family member.{{efn|The historian Frank Barlow points out that William had suffered from his uncle Mauger's ambitions while young and thus would not have countenanced creating another such situation.&lt;ref name=Barlow59/&gt;}} Another reason for the appointment may have been pressure from the papacy to appoint Lanfranc.&lt;ref name=Barlow59&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1066–1154'' p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Norman clergy were appointed to replace the deposed bishops and abbots, and at the end of the process, only two native English bishops remained in office, along with several continental prelates appointed by Edward the Confessor.&lt;ref name=Bates106&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; In 1070 William also founded [[Battle Abbey]], a new monastery at the site of the Battle of Hastings, partly as a penance for the deaths in the battle and partly as a memorial to the dead.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

== Troubles in England and the continent ==

=== Danish raids and rebellion ===

Although Sweyn had promised to leave England, he returned in spring 1070, raiding along the Humber and East Anglia toward the [[Isle of Ely]], where he joined up with [[Hereward the Wake]], a local [[thegn]]. Hereward's forces attacked [[Peterborough Abbey]], which they captured and looted. William was able to secure the departure of Sweyn and his fleet in 1070,&lt;ref name=Douglas221&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 221–222&lt;/ref&gt; allowing him to return to the continent to deal with troubles in Maine, where the town of [[Le Mans]] had revolted in 1069. Another concern was the death of Count [[Baldwin VI of Flanders]] in July 1070, which led to a succession crisis as his widow, [[Richilde, Countess of Hainaut|Richilde]], was ruling for their two young sons, [[Arnulf III, Count of Flanders|Arnulf]] and [[Baldwin II, Count of Hainaut|Baldwin]]. Her rule, however, was contested by [[Robert I, Count of Flanders|Robert]], Baldwin's brother. Richilde proposed marriage to William fitzOsbern, who was in Normandy, and fitzOsbern accepted. But after he was killed in February 1071 at the [[Battle of Cassel (1071)|Battle of Cassel]], Robert became count. He was opposed to King William's power on the continent, thus the Battle of Cassel upset the balance of power in northern France in addition to costing William an important supporter.&lt;ref name=Douglas223&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 223–225&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1071 William defeated the last rebellion of the north. Earl Edwin was betrayed by his own men and killed, while William built a causeway to subdue the Isle of Ely, where Hereward the Wake and Morcar were hiding. Hereward escaped, but Morcar was captured, deprived of his earldom, and imprisoned. In 1072 William invaded Scotland, defeating Malcolm, who had recently invaded the north of England. William and Malcolm agreed to peace by signing the [[Treaty of Abernethy]], and Malcolm probably gave up his son [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan]] as a hostage for the peace. Perhaps another stipulation of the treaty was the expulsion of Edgar the Ætheling from Malcolm's court.&lt;ref name=Bates107&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 107–109&lt;/ref&gt; William then turned his attention to the continent, returning to Normandy in early 1073 to deal with the invasion of Maine by [[Fulk le Rechin]], the [[Count of Anjou]]. With a swift campaign, William seized Le Mans from Fulk's forces, completing the campaign by 30 March 1073. This made William's power more secure in northern France, but the new count of Flanders accepted Edgar the Ætheling into his court. Robert also married his half-sister [[Bertha of Holland|Bertha]] to the king of France, [[Philip I of France|Philip I]], who was opposed to Norman power.&lt;ref name=Douglas228&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 228–229&lt;/ref&gt;

William returned to England to release his army from service in 1073 but quickly returned to Normandy, where he spent all of 1074.&lt;ref name=Bates111&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; He left England in the hands of his supporters, including [[Richard fitzGilbert]] and William de Warenne,&lt;ref name=Bates112 /&gt; as well as Lanfranc.&lt;ref name=Douglas231 /&gt; William's ability to leave England for an entire year was a sign that he felt that his control of the kingdom was secure.&lt;ref name=Bates112&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; While William was in Normandy, Edgar the Ætheling returned to Scotland from Flanders. The French king, seeking a focus for those opposed to William's power, then proposed that Edgar be given the castle of [[Montreuil-sur-Mer]] on the Channel, which would have given Edgar a strategic advantage against William.&lt;ref name=Douglas230 /&gt; Edgar was forced to submit to William shortly thereafter, however, and he returned to William's court.&lt;ref name=Bates111 /&gt;{{efn|Edgar remained at William's court until 1086 when he went to the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman principality in southern Italy]].&lt;ref name=Bates111 /&gt;}} Philip, although thwarted in this attempt, turned his attentions to Brittany, leading to a revolt in 1075.&lt;ref name=Douglas230&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 230–231&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revolt of the Earls ===
{{Main article|Revolt of the Earls}}
[[File:Castle Mound - Norwich - geograph.org.uk - 780624.jpg|thumb|left|[[Norwich Castle]]. The [[keep]] dates to after the Revolt of the Earls, but the castle mound is earlier.&lt;ref name=Castles161&gt;Pettifer ''English Castles'' pp. 161–162&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1075, during William's absence, [[Ralph de Gael]], the [[Earl of Norfolk]], and [[Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford|Roger de Breteuil]], the [[Earl of Hereford]], conspired to overthrow William in the "Revolt of the Earls".&lt;ref name=Douglas231/&gt; Ralph was at least part Breton and had spent most of his life prior to 1066 in Brittany, where he still had lands.&lt;ref name=Ralph&gt;Williams "Ralph, earl" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; Roger was a Norman, son of William fitzOsbern, but had inherited less authority than his father held.&lt;ref name=Roger&gt;Lewis "Breteuil, Roger de, earl of Hereford" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph's authority seems also to have been less than his predecessors in the earldom, and this was likely the cause of his involvement in the revolt.&lt;ref name=Ralph/&gt;

The exact reason for the rebellion is unclear, but it was launched at the wedding of Ralph to a relative of Roger, held at [[Exning]] in Suffolk. Another earl, Waltheof, although one of William's favourites, was also involved, and there were some Breton lords who were ready to rebel in support of Ralph and Roger. Ralph also requested Danish aid. William remained in Normandy while his men in England subdued the revolt. Roger was unable to leave his stronghold in Herefordshire because of efforts by [[Wulfstan (died 1095)|Wulfstan]], the [[Bishop of Worcester]], and [[Æthelwig]], the [[Abbot of Evesham]]. Ralph was bottled up in [[Norwich Castle]] by the combined efforts of Odo of Bayeux, [[Geoffrey de Montbray]], Richard fitzGilbert, and William de Warenne. Ralph eventually left Norwich in the control of his wife and left England, finally ending up in Brittany. Norwich was besieged and surrendered, with the garrison allowed to go to Brittany. Meanwhile, the Danish king's brother, [[Canute IV of Denmark|Cnut]], had finally arrived in England with a fleet of 200 ships, but he was too late as Norwich had already surrendered. The Danes then raided along the coast before returning home.&lt;ref name=Douglas231 /&gt; William returned to England later in 1075 to deal with the Danish threat, leaving his wife Matilda in charge of Normandy. He celebrated Christmas at Winchester and dealt with the aftermath of the rebellion.&lt;ref name=Bates181&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 181–182&lt;/ref&gt; Roger and Waltheof were kept in prison, where Waltheof was executed in May 1076. Before this, William had returned to the continent, where Ralph had continued the rebellion from Brittany.&lt;ref name=Douglas231&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 231–233&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Troubles at home and abroad ===

Earl Ralph had secured control of the castle at [[Dol-de-Bretagne|Dol]], and in September 1076 William advanced into Brittany and laid siege to the castle. King Philip of France later relieved the siege and defeated William at [[Battle of Dol (1076)|Dol]], forcing him to retreat back to Normandy. Although this was William's first defeat in battle, it did little to change things. An Angevin attack on Maine was defeated in late 1076 or 1077, with Count Fulk le Rechin wounded in the unsuccessful attack. More serious was the retirement of [[Simon de Crépy]], the [[Count of Amiens]], to a monastery. Before he became a monk, Simon handed his county of the [[Vexin]] over to King Philip. The Vexin was a buffer state between Normandy and the lands of the French king, and Simon had been a supporter of William.{{efn|Although Simon was a supporter of William, the Vexin was actually under the overlordship of King Philip, which is why Philip secured control of the county when Simon became a monk.&lt;ref name=Bates183/&gt;}} William was able to make peace with Philip in 1077 and secured a truce with Count Fulk in late 1077 or early 1078.&lt;ref name=Bates183&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1077 or early 1078 trouble began between William and his eldest son, Robert. Although Orderic Vitalis describes it as starting with a quarrel between Robert and his two younger brothers, [[William II of England|William]] and [[Henry I of England|Henry]], including a story that the quarrel was started when William and Henry threw water at Robert, it is much more likely that Robert was feeling powerless. Orderic relates that he had previously demanded control of Maine and Normandy and had been rebuffed. The trouble in 1077 or 1078 resulted in Robert leaving Normandy accompanied by a band of young men, many of them the sons of William's supporters. Included among them was [[Robert of Belleme]], [[William de Breteuil]], and Roger, the son of Richard fitzGilbert. This band of young men went to the castle at [[Remalard]], where they proceeded to raid into Normandy. The raiders were supported by many of William's continental enemies.&lt;ref name=Bates185&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 185–186&lt;/ref&gt; William immediately attacked the rebels and drove them from Remalard, but King Philip gave them the castle at [[Gerberoi]], where they were joined by new supporters. William then laid siege to Gerberoi in January 1079. After three weeks, the besieged forces [[sortie|sallied]] from the castle and managed to take the besiegers by surprise. William was unhorsed by Robert and was only saved from death by an Englishman, Toki son of Wigod, who was himself killed.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas and Greenaway, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; William's forces were forced to lift the siege, and the king returned to Rouen. By 12 April 1080, William and Robert had reached an accommodation, with William once more affirming that Robert would receive Normandy when he died.&lt;ref name=Douglas238&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 238–239&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Williams dominions 1087.jpg|thumb|upright|Map showing William's lands in 1087 (the light pink areas were controlled by William).]]
Word of William's defeat at Gerberoi stirred up difficulties in northern England. In August and September 1079 King Malcolm of Scots raided south of the [[River Tweed]], devastating the land between the [[River Tees]] and the Tweed in a raid that lasted almost a month. The lack of Norman response appears to have caused the Northumbrians to grow restive, and in the spring of 1080 they rebelled against the rule of [[Walcher]], the [[Bishop of Durham]] and Earl of Northumbria. The bishop was killed on 14 May 1080, and William dispatched his half-brother Odo to deal with the rebellion.&lt;ref name=Douglas240/&gt; William departed Normandy in July 1080,&lt;ref name=Bates188&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; and in the autumn William's son Robert was sent on a campaign against the Scots. Robert raided into Lothian and forced Malcolm to agree to terms, building a fortification at [[Newcastle-on-Tyne]] while returning to England.&lt;ref name=Douglas240&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 240–241&lt;/ref&gt; The king was at Gloucester for Christmas 1080 and at Winchester for [[Whitsun]] in 1081, ceremonially wearing his crown on both occasions. A papal embassy arrived in England during this period, asking that William do fealty for England to the papacy, a request that William rejected.&lt;ref name=Bates188/&gt; William also visited Wales during 1081, although the English and the Welsh sources differ on the exact purpose of the visit. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' states that it was a military campaign, but Welsh sources record it as a pilgrimage to [[St Davids]] in honour of [[Saint David]]. William's biographer David Bates argues that the former explanation is more likely, explaining that the balance of power had recently shifted in Wales and that William would have wished to take advantage of the changed circumstances to extend Norman power. By the end of 1081, William was back on the continent, dealing with disturbances in Maine. Although he led an expedition into Maine, the result was instead a negotiated settlement arranged by a papal legate.&lt;ref name=Bates189&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Last years ===

Sources for William's actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre. According to the historian David Bates, this probably means that little happened of note, and that because William was on the continent, there was nothing for the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' to record.&lt;ref name=Bates193&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; In 1082 William ordered the arrest of his half-brother Odo. The exact reasons are unclear, as no contemporary author recorded what caused the quarrel between the half-brothers. Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had aspirations to become pope. Orderic also related that Odo had attempted to persuade some of William's vassals to join Odo on an invasion of southern Italy. This would have been considered tampering with the king's authority over his vassals, which William would not have tolerated. Although Odo remained in confinement for the rest of William's reign, his lands were not confiscated. More difficulties struck in 1083, when William's eldest son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king. A further blow was the death of Matilda, William's wife, on 2 November 1083. William was always described as close to his wife, and her death would have added to his problems.&lt;ref name=Douglas243&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 243–244&lt;/ref&gt;

Maine continued to be difficult, with a rebellion by [[Hubert de Beaumont-au-Maine]], probably in 1084. Hubert was besieged in his castle at [[Siege of Saint-Suzanne, 1083-1086|Sainte-Suzanne]] by William's forces for at least two years, but he eventually made his peace with the king and was restored to favour. William's movements during 1084 and 1085 are unclear&amp;nbsp;– he was in Normandy at Easter 1084 but may have been in England before then to collect the [[danegeld]] assessed that year for the defence of England against an invasion by King [[Cnut IV of Denmark]]. Although English and Norman forces remained on alert throughout 1085 and into 1086, the invasion threat was ended by Cnut's death in July 1086.&lt;ref name=Bates196&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 196–198&lt;/ref&gt;

== William as king ==

=== Changes in England ===
{{See also|English castles|Royal forest#Royal forests in England}}

[[File:Tower of London White Tower.jpg|thumb|left|The [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] in London, begun by William&lt;ref name=Castles151&gt;Pettifer ''English Castles'' p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As part of his efforts to secure England, William ordered many [[castle]]s, [[keep]]s, and [[motte-and-bailey|mottes]] built&amp;nbsp;– among them the central keep of the [[Tower of London]], the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]]. These fortifications allowed Normans to retreat into safety when threatened with rebellion and allowed garrisons to be protected while they occupied the countryside. The early castles were simple earth and timber constructions, later replaced with stone structures.&lt;ref name=Bates147&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 147–148&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, most of the newly settled Normans kept household [[knight]]s and did not settle their retainers with [[fief]]s of their own, but gradually these household knights came to be granted lands of their own, a process known as [[subinfeudation]]. William also required his newly created magnates to contribute fixed quotas of knights towards not only military campaigns but also castle garrisons. This method of organising the military forces was a departure from the pre-Conquest English practice of basing military service on territorial units such as the [[Hide (unit)|hide]].&lt;ref name=Bates154&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt;

By William's death, after weathering a series of rebellions, most of the native Anglo-Saxon aristocracy had been replaced by Norman and other continental magnates. Not all of the Normans who accompanied William in the initial conquest acquired large amounts of land in England. Some appear to have been reluctant to take up lands in a kingdom that did not always appear pacified. Although some of the newly rich Normans in England came from William's close family or from the upper Norman nobility, others were from relatively humble backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Bates148&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; William granted some lands to his continental followers from the holdings of one or more specific Englishmen; at other times, he granted a compact grouping of lands previously held by many different Englishmen to one Norman follower, often to allow for the consolidation of lands around a strategically placed castle.&lt;ref name=Bates152&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]] says that the king also seized and depopulated many miles of land (36 parishes), turning it into the royal [[New Forest]] region to support his enthusiastic enjoyment of hunting. Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the New Forest depopulation was greatly exaggerated. Most of the lands of the New Forest are poor agricultural lands, and archaeological and geographic studies have shown that the New Forest was likely sparsely settled when it was turned into a royal forest.&lt;ref name=Young7&gt;Young ''Royal Forests'' pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; William was known for his love of hunting, and he introduced the [[Royal forest|forest law]] into areas of the country, regulating who could hunt and what could be hunted.&lt;ref name=Bates118&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administration ===
{{Main article|Norman conquest of England#Consequences}}

[[File:William the Conqueror 1066 1087.jpg|thumb|upright|English coin of William the Conqueror]]

After 1066, William did not attempt to integrate his separate domains into one unified realm with one set of laws. His [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] from after 1066, of which six impressions still survive, was made for him after he conquered England and stressed his role as king, while separately mentioning his role as Duke.{{efn|The seal shows a mounted knight and is the first extant example of an [[equestrian seal]].&lt;ref name=Bates138/&gt;}} When in Normandy, William acknowledged that he owed [[fealty]] to the French king, but in England no such acknowledgment was made&amp;nbsp;– further evidence that the various parts of William's lands were considered separate. The administrative machinery of Normandy, England, and Maine continued to exist separate from the other lands, with each one retaining its own forms. For example, England continued the use of [[writ]]s, which were not known on the continent. Also, the charters and documents produced for the government in Normandy differed in formulas from those produced in England.&lt;ref name=Bates138&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 138–141&lt;/ref&gt;

William took over an English government that was more complex than the Norman system. England was divided into [[shire]]s or counties, which were further divided into either [[hundred (county subdivision)|hundreds]] or [[wapentake]]s. Each shire was administered by a royal official called a sheriff, who roughly had the same status as a Norman [[viscount]]. A sheriff was responsible for royal justice and collecting royal revenue.&lt;ref name=Bates23/&gt; To oversee his expanded domain, William was forced to travel even more than he had as duke. He crossed back and forth between the continent and England at least 19 times between 1067 and his death. William spent most of his time in England between the Battle of Hastings and 1072, and after that, he spent the majority of his time in Normandy.&lt;ref name=Bates133134&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Between 1066 and 1072, William spent only 15 months in Normandy and the rest in England. After returning to Normandy in 1072, William spent around 130 months in Normandy as against about 40 months in England.&lt;ref name=Bates133134/&gt;}} Government was still centred on William's [[royal household|household]]; when he was in one part of his realms, decisions would be made for other parts of his domains and transmitted through a communication system that made use of letters and other documents. William also appointed deputies who could make decisions while he was absent, especially if the absence was expected to be lengthy. Usually, this was a member of William's close family&amp;nbsp;– frequently his half-brother Odo or his wife Matilda. Sometimes deputies were appointed to deal with specific issues.&lt;ref name=Bates136&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

William continued the collection of danegeld, a land tax. This was an advantage for William, as it was the only universal tax collected by western European rulers during this period. It was an annual tax based on the value of landholdings, and it could be collected at differing rates. Most years saw the rate of two shillings per hide, but in crises, it could be increased to as much as six shillings per hide.&lt;ref name=Bates151&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 151–152&lt;/ref&gt; Coinage between the various parts of his domains continued to be minted in different cycles and styles. English coins were generally of high silver content, with high artistic standards, and were required to be re-minted every three years. Norman coins had a much lower silver content, were often of poor artistic quality, and were rarely re-minted. Also, in England, no other coinage was allowed, while on the continent other coinage was considered [[legal tender]]. Nor is there evidence that many English [[pennies]] were circulating in Normandy, which shows little attempt to integrate the monetary systems of England and Normandy.&lt;ref name=Bates138/&gt;

Besides taxation, William's large landholdings throughout England strengthened his rule. As King Edward's heir, he controlled all of the former royal lands. He also retained control of much of the lands of Harold and his family, which made the king the largest secular landowner in England by a wide margin.{{efn|In ''[[Domesday Book]]'', the king's lands were worth four times as much as the lands of his half-brother Odo, the next largest landowner, and seven times as much as [[Roger of Montgomery]], the third-largest landowner.&lt;ref name=Bates150&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Domesday Book ===
{{Main article|Domesday Book}}
[[File:Domesday Book - Warwickshire.png|upright|thumb|A page from ''Domesday Book'' for Warwickshire]]

At Christmas 1085, William ordered the compilation of a survey of the landholdings held by himself and by his vassals throughout his kingdom, organised by counties. It resulted in a work now known as the ''Domesday Book''. The listing for each county gives the holdings of each landholder, grouped by owners. The listings describe the holding, who owned the land before the Conquest, its value, what the tax assessment was, and usually the number of peasants, ploughs, and any other resources the holding had. Towns were listed separately. All the English counties south of the River Tees and [[River Ribble]] are included, and the whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 August 1086, when the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' records that William received the results and that all the chief magnates swore the [[Oath of Salisbury|Salisbury Oath]], a renewal of their oaths of allegiance.&lt;ref name=Bates198&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 198–202&lt;/ref&gt; William's exact motivation in ordering the survey is unclear, but it probably had several purposes, such as making a record of feudal obligations and justifying increased taxation.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

== Death and aftermath ==

William left England towards the end of 1086. Following his arrival back on the continent he married his daughter [[Constance of Normandy|Constance]] to [[Alan Fergant]], the Duke of Brittany, in furtherance of his policy of seeking allies against the French kings. William's son Robert, still allied with the French king, appears to have been active in stirring up trouble, enough so that William led an expedition against the French [[Vexin]] in July 1087. While seizing [[Mantes-la-Jolie|Mantes]], William either fell ill or was injured by the [[pommel (saddle)|pommel]] of his saddle.&lt;ref name=Bates202/&gt; He was taken to the [[priory]] of Saint Gervase at Rouen, where he died on 9 September 1087.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Knowledge of the events preceding his death is confused because there are two different accounts. Orderic Vitalis preserves a lengthy account, complete with speeches made by many of the principals, but this is likely more of an account of how a king should die than of what actually happened. The other, the ''[[De Obitu Willelmi]]'', or ''On the Death of William'', has been shown to be a copy of two 9th-century accounts with names changed.&lt;ref name=Bates202&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 202–205&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Church of Saint-Étienne interior (2).jpg|thumb|left|William's grave at [[Abbaye-aux-Hommes]], Caen]]

William left Normandy to Robert, and the custody of England was given to William's second surviving son, also called William, on the assumption that he would become king. The youngest son, Henry, received money. After entrusting England to his second son, the elder William sent the younger William back to England on 7 or 8 September, bearing a letter to Lanfranc ordering the archbishop to aid the new king. Other bequests included gifts to the Church and money to be distributed to the poor. William also ordered that all of his prisoners be released, including his half-brother Odo.&lt;ref name=Bates202/&gt;

Disorder followed William's death; everyone who had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired to be buried in his foundation of the [[Abbaye-aux-Hommes]]. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations, the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb. The corpse was too large for the space, and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.&lt;ref name=Bates207&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 207–208&lt;/ref&gt;

William's grave is currently marked by a marble slab with a [[Latin]] inscription dating from the early 19th century. The tomb has been disturbed several times since 1087, the first time in 1522 when the grave was opened on orders from the papacy. The intact body was restored to the tomb at that time, but in 1562, during the [[French Wars of Religion]], the grave was reopened and the bones scattered and lost, with the exception of one thigh bone. This lone relic was reburied in 1642 with a new marker, which was replaced 100 years later with a more elaborate monument. This tomb was again destroyed during the [[French Revolution]] but was eventually replaced with the current marker.&lt;ref name=Douglas362&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 362–363&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The thigh bone currently in the tomb is assumed to be the one that was reburied in 1642, but the Victorian historian [[E. A. Freeman]] was of the opinion that the bone had been lost in 1793.&lt;ref name=Douglas363&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 363 footnote 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Legacy ==
The immediate consequence of William's death was a war between his sons Robert and William over control of England and Normandy.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Even after the younger William's death in 1100 and the succession of his youngest brother Henry as king, Normandy and England remained contested between the brothers until Robert's capture by Henry at the [[Battle of Tinchebray]] in 1106. The difficulties over the succession led to a loss of authority in Normandy, with the aristocracy regaining much of the power they had lost to the elder William. His sons also lost much of their control over Maine, which revolted in 1089 and managed to remain mostly free of Norman influence thereafter.&lt;ref name=Bates208&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 208–209&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact on England of William's conquest was profound; changes in the Church, aristocracy, culture, and language of the country have persisted into modern times. The Conquest brought the kingdom into closer contact with France and forged ties between France and England that lasted throughout the Middle Ages. Another consequence of William's invasion was the sundering of the formerly close ties between England and Scandinavia.  William's government blended elements of the English and Norman systems into a new one that laid the foundations of the later medieval English kingdom.&lt;ref name=Bates210&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; How abrupt and far-reaching were the changes is still a matter of debate among historians, with some such as [[Richard Southern]] claiming that the Conquest was the single most radical change in European history between the Fall of Rome and the 20th century. Others, such as H. G. Richardson and G. O. Sayles, see the changes brought about by the Conquest as much less radical than Southern suggests.&lt;ref name=Rulers31/&gt; The historian Eleanor Searle describes William's invasion as "a plan that no ruler but a Scandinavian would have considered".&lt;ref name=Searle232&gt;Searle ''Predatory Kinship'' p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

William's reign has caused historical controversy since before his death. William of Poitiers wrote glowingly of William's reign and its benefits, but the obituary notice for William in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' condemns William in harsh terms.&lt;ref name=Rulers31&gt;Clanchy ''England and its Rulers'' pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; In the years since the Conquest, politicians and other leaders have used William and the events of his reign to illustrate political events throughout English history. During the reign of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], Archbishop [[Matthew Parker]] saw the Conquest as having corrupted a purer English Church, which Parker attempted to restore. During the 17th and 18th centuries, some historians and lawyers saw William's reign as imposing a "[[Norman yoke]]" on the native Anglo-Saxons, an argument that continued during the 19th century with further elaborations along nationalistic lines. These various controversies have led to William being seen by some historians either as one of the creators of England's greatness or as inflicting one of the greatest defeats in English history. Others have viewed William as an enemy of the English constitution, or alternatively as its creator.&lt;ref name=Douglas4&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family and children ==
William and his wife Matilda of Flanders had at least nine children.&lt;ref name=Douglas393 /&gt; The birth order of the sons is clear, but no source gives the relative order of birth of the daughters.&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt;

# [[Robert Curthose|Robert]] was born between 1051 and 1054, died 10 February 1134.&lt;ref name=Douglas393&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 393–395&lt;/ref&gt; Duke of Normandy, married [[Sybilla of Conversano]], daughter of [[Geoffrey, Count of Conversano]].&lt;ref name=RobertDNB&gt;Thompson "Robert, duke of Normandy" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Richard, son of William the Conqueror|Richard]] was born before 1056, died around 1075.&lt;ref name=Douglas393/&gt;
# [[William II of England|William]] was born between 1056 and 1060, died 2 August 1100.&lt;ref name=Douglas393/&gt; King of England, killed in the New Forest.&lt;ref name=RufusDNB&gt;Barlow "William II" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Henry I of England|Henry]] was born in late 1068, died 1 December 1135.&lt;ref name=Douglas393/&gt; King of England, married [[Matilda of Scotland|Edith of Scotland]], daughter of [[Malcolm III of Scotland]]. His second wife was [[Adeliza of Louvain]].&lt;ref name=Handbook35/&gt;
# [[Adeliza]] (or Adelida,&lt;ref name=Adelida /&gt; Adelaide&lt;ref name=Handbook35&gt;Fryde, et al., ''Handbook of British Chronology'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;) died before 1113, reportedly betrothed to [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II of England]], probably a nun of Saint Léger at Préaux.&lt;ref name=Adelida&gt;Van Houts "Adelida" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Cecilia of Normandy|Cecilia]] (or Cecily) was born before 1066, died 1127, Abbess of [[Abbey of Sainte-Trinité, Caen|Holy Trinity, Caen]].&lt;ref name=Douglas393/&gt;
# Matilda&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Bates "William I" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adelida /&gt; was born around 1061, died perhaps about 1086.&lt;ref name=Handbook35/&gt; Mentioned in ''Domesday Book'' as a daughter of William.&lt;ref name=Douglas393/&gt;
# [[Constance of Normandy|Constance]] died 1090, married [[Alan IV, Duke of Brittany|Alan IV Fergent]], [[Duke of Brittany]].&lt;ref name=Douglas393/&gt;
# [[Adela of Normandy|Adela]] died 1137, married [[Stephen, Count of Blois]].&lt;ref name=Douglas393/&gt;
# (Possibly) Agatha, the betrothed of [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]].{{efn|[[William of Poitiers]] relates that two brothers, Iberian kings, were competitors for the hand of a daughter of William, which led to a dispute between them.&lt;ref name=Salazar&gt;Salazar y Acha "Contribución al estudio" ''Anales de la Real Academia'' pp. 307–308&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have identified these as [[Sancho II of León and Castile|Sancho II of Castile]] and his brother [[García II of Galicia]], and the bride as Sancho's documented wife Alberta, who bears a non-Iberian name.&lt;ref name=Reilly&gt;Reilly ''Kingdom of Leon-Castile Under Alfonso VI'' p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The anonymous ''vita'' of Count Simon of Crépy instead makes the competitors [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile|Alfonso VI of León]] and [[Robert Guiscard]], while [[William of Malmesbury]] and [[Orderic Vitalis]] both show a daughter of William to have been betrothed to Alfonso "king of Galicia" but to have died before the marriage.  In his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Orderic specifically names her as Agatha, "former fiancee of Harold".&lt;ref name=Salazar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reilly/&gt; This conflicts with Orderic's own earlier additions to the ''[[Gesta Normannorum Ducum]]'', where he instead named Harold's fiance as William's daughter, Adelidis.&lt;ref name=Adelida/&gt; Recent accounts of the complex marital history of Alfonso VI have accepted that he was betrothed to a daughter of William named Agatha,&lt;ref name=Salazar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reilly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canal Sánchez-Pagín "Jimena Muñoz" ''Anuario de Estudios Medievales'' pp. 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; while Douglas dismisses Agatha as a confused reference to known daughter Adeliza.&lt;ref name=Douglas393/&gt; Elisabeth van Houts is non-committal, being open to the possibility that Adeliza was engaged before becoming a nun, but also accepting that Agatha may have been a distinct daughter of William.&lt;ref name=Adelida/&gt;}}

There is no evidence of any illegitimate children born to William.&lt;ref name=Bastards59&gt;Given-Wilson and Curteis ''Royal Bastards'' p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research''' ('''WCFTR''') is a major archive of motion picture, television, radio, and theater research materials. Located in the headquarters building of the [[Wisconsin Historical Society]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], the WCFTR holds over three hundred collections from motion picture, television, and theater writers, producers, actors, designers, directors, and production companies. These collections include business records, personal papers, scripts, photographs, promotional graphics, and some twenty thousand films and videotapes of motion picture and television productions.

The WCFTR is regularly visited by researchers from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/about/ About Us page] at the WCFTR website.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1955 the Wisconsin Historical Society established the Mass Communications History Center to document the importance of journalism, broadcasting, advertising, and public relations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/libraryarchives/readroom/masscol.asp Mass Communications History Collections] at the Wisconsin Historical Society website.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that initiative's value, the University of Wisconsin's Speech and Theater Department formed the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research in 1960. Today the WCFTR is part of the university's Communication Arts Department and is operated in partnership with the Wisconsin Historical Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/about/history/ About Us:History page] at the WCFTR website.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film ==
The film collection contains a variety of American and international cinema with rich holdings of Hollywood films from the 1930s to the 1960s, independent films from the 1960s to the 1980s, post-World War II Soviet films from the 1950s to the 1970s, and Taiwanese films from the late 1970s to the 1990s.
Highlights of the film collection include
* 2,000 16mm reference prints of  Warner Brothers, RKO and Monogram Pictures films—nearly every feature released between 1931 and 1949
* 1500 Vitaphone short subjects
* 300 Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons from 1926 to 1949
* 270 Soviet features and documentaries
* 120 Taiwanese features
* films by independent filmmakers including [[Shirley Clarke]], [[Emile de Antonio]], [[Lionel Rogosin]], Richard Kaplan, Jill Godmilow, and [[Lewis Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/collections/film/ Collections:Film page] at the WCFTR website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Complementing the films are paper records usually organized by the donor's name. Prominent examples include these collections:&lt;ref&gt;http://srnconference2013.commarts.wisc.edu/research-opportunities/ Screenwriting Research Network International Conference 2013: Research&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://arcat.library.wisc.edu/ Details of donors' collections derived from Archives Computer Catalog searches (ArCat).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radio ==
Although the WCFTR is not primarily an archive of radio, many of its collections were donated by writers, producers, and actors—such as [[Nat Hiken]], [[Rod Serling]], [[Alvin Boretz]], [[Irna Phillips]], and [[William Spier]]—who were active in radio production in addition to their involvement with television, motion pictures, or the theater. As a result, the WCFTR holds collections touching on radio production in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The collections contain some sound recordings, but paper records predominate, including hundreds of scripts for radio productions. Here is a sample of radio programs for which there are scripts in the collections: ''[[The Adventures of Sam Spade]], [[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]], [[The Aldrich Family]], America in the Air, Best Plays, [[Beulah (series)|The Beulah Show]], [[The Big Story (radio/TV series)|The Big Story]], [[Big Town]], [[Cavalcade of America]], [[The Chesterfield Supper Club]], [[The Clock (radio)|The Clock]], [[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]], [[Dr. Sixgun]], [[Escape (radio program)|Escape]], [[Ford Theatre]], [[The Fred Allen Show]], The Grouch Club, Haven of Hope, Hollywood Love Story, [[Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar]], Kay Thompson and Company, Magazine Theater, [[The Marriage (radio)|The Marriage]], Modern Tales of Hoffman, My Secret Story, NBC Theatre, [[NBC University Theatre]], [[Nick Carter, Master Detective|Nick Carter—Master Detective]], [[Philip Morris Playhouse]], Prudential Family Hour of Stars, Rooftops of New York, [[The Shadow]], Star Spangled Theatre, [[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]], [[The United States Steel Hour|The Theatre Guild on the Air]], United Nations Radio, Up for Parole, Woman in Love,'' and ''[[X Minus One]],'' among many others.&lt;ref&gt;http://arcat.library.wisc.edu/ Details of collections with radio content derived from Archives Computer Catalog searches (ArCat).&lt;/ref&gt;
