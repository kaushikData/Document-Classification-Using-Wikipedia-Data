[[Image:ARC Centre for Complex Systems (logo).jpg|thumb|ACCS Logo]]

The '''ARC Centre for Complex Systems (ACCS''') was established in 2004 from a consortium of Australian universities, led by the [[University of Queensland]]. The objective of ACCS was to conduct basic and applied research in the field of [[complex systems]]. It conducted research into both the science and engineering of complex systems. Funding was provided by the [[Australian Research Council]] (ARC) and the universities involved. The ACCS was funded under the ARC's [[Center of excellence|Centre of Excellence]] Scheme &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arc.gov.au/ncgp/ce/2003_coe_funding.htm ARC Centres of Excellence Scheme 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625030916/http://www.arc.gov.au/ncgp/ce/2003_coe_funding.htm |date=25 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until mid-2009, after which industry collaborations and further funding was established to continue to apply the Centre's research.

== Overview ==
[[Complex systems]] science is an emerging discipline developing new ways of investigating large, highly intricate, dynamically changing systems across diverse areas such as biology, social networks and socio-technological systems, economics and the environment. The ACCS was established to conduct world-class research on questions fundamental to understanding, designing and managing complex systems.

While complex systems research is considered basic research, with commercialisation still some time off, complex computing holds answers to real-life systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/technology/making-the-pace-in-a-hot-new-year/2006/01/30/1138469633668.html Making the pace in a hot new year], Beverley Head, theAge.com.au, Technology, 1 January 2006
&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACCS provided a focus for complex systems science research in Australia, and developed strong infrastructure for modelling and analysing network-based systems, enabling the science to be applied to real-world problems.

The Centre had its headquarters at [[The University of Queensland]] in Brisbane, with nodes at [[Griffith University]] in Brisbane, [[Monash University]] in Melbourne, and [[The University of New South Wales]] campus at the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] in Canberra.

The ACCS's research programs emphasised cross-disciplinary research, involving leading researchers from a range of disciplines including: systems and software engineering, economics, visualisation, human factors, computational mathematics and statistics, and relevant application domains including aerospace, economics, energy and biology.

== Research program ==
The goal of the ACCS's research was to develop deeper understanding of fundamental phenomena in complex systems, such as how macro-level system properties and behaviours emerge from relatively simple micro-level interactions, what mechanisms enable complex systems to self-organise, and how complex systems can be managed and controlled.

The [http://www.accs.uq.edu.au/research.html Centre's core research program] was based around a number of application areas.

=== Genetic regulatory networks=== 
Research in this program tackled fundamental questions about growth and form in cellular biology. Computational modelling was used to study how the control of development results from an interaction between each cell's genetic regulatory network and its inputs from neighbouring cells and its environment, and how the process proceeds reliably, while coping with unreliable components, perturbation, injury, and changing environments.

=== Air traffic control ===
This program applied complex systems science to the problem of improving the efficiency of air travel without compromising safety. To do this, researchers developed and used air traffic simulators to study new concepts and tools for air traffic management, and developed new approaches to assurance of system-level properties including safety and efficiency&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/next/its-life-but-not-as-we-know-it/2005/11/28/1133026374254.html It's life, but not as we know it], Beverley Head, theAge.com.au, Technology, 29 November 2005
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Evolutionary economic systems=== 
In this program, complex systems and network theory was applied to economics and business to understand how evolutionary change occurs. Multi-agent modelling and associated simulation and calibration techniques were core components of the methodology used. We investigated new ways of testing for complex patterns in high frequency data, by studying trade-by trade data in stock markets and in electricity markets and seeking 'pattern matches' in artificially generated agent-based modelling data. We investigated new ways of dealing with spatial complexity in several contexts. Also visualisation techniques, rarely used in economics, were applied in a range of data-rich contexts to better understand the architecture and complex dynamics of systems. 

=== Electricity networks and energy markets=== 
This program investigated ways of integrating technical and market aspects of power systems with price dynamics to provide key insights into planning expansion of Australia's power transmission network. It also aimed to apply modern computational modelling techniques to the interface between the physical properties of the electricity system and its economic considerations. A particular focus was placed on the impacts of the transmission network and power station operation on electricity price behaviour and its influence on infrastructure investment decisions. It also looked into the importance of customer-load impact on system and market operations.

=== Dependable computer-based systems=== 
This program was concerned with the development of modelling and analysis tools to ensure that dependability is designed into complex computer-based systems, particularly in areas such as transport, health and finance. There is a constant need for new methods and tools to enable engineers to ensure that such systems meet society's demands for dependability, safety and reliability.
One of the tools, Behavior Trees, was successfully trialled by Raytheon Australia to analyse six large defence projects.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.raytheon.com.au/Default.aspx?x=501 Raytheon Australia supports pioneering systems research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915050723/http://www.raytheon.com.au/Default.aspx?x=501 |date=15 September 2009 }}, Raytheon News Release, 3 September 2008 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finding a simple solution to complex systems, David Binning, [http://www.afr.com/home/The Australian Financial Review], 9 October 2008, p7 Project Management Special Report &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex systems theory and applications === 
In addition to the research programs described above, the ACCS included a number of projects addressing key problems for complex systems. The projects were concerned with the application of theory to solve issues in the design and operation of complex socio-technological systems, and with the development of new analysis techniques for complex systems.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.calit2.net/newsroom/article.php?id=1483 Cyberinfrastructure expert spells out cooperation Between US and Australia], Tiffany Fox, Calit2 Newsroom Web article, 5 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tom Newberry, the spokesperson for GTC, the company plans to acquire additional approval for treatment of those with non-hereditary antithrombin deficiency.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"/&gt;

The [[Humane Society of the United States]] has said of the process used to manufacture ATryn, "It is a mechanistic use of animals that seems to perpetuate the notion of their being merely tools for human use rather than sentient creatures."&lt;ref name="HT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HSUS Position Statement: Genetic Engineering of Animals |url=http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/general_information_on_animal_research/hsus_position_statements/hsus_position_statement__genetic_engineering_of_animals.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203040734/http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/general_information_on_animal_research/hsus_position_statements/hsus_position_statement__genetic_engineering_of_animals.html |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the genetic change has no known ill-effects on the host animal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

[[File:Zebra Jumping Spider (2867026951).jpg|thumb|Zebra Jumping Spider showing its teeth.]]
The definition of [[biting]] is to seize, especially with teeth or jaws so as to enter, grip, or wound.&lt;ref&gt;Bite. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bite&lt;/ref&gt; The muscle fibers in the jaw are responsible for opening and closing of the mouth. They initially allow the organism to open the jaw, then contract to bring the teeth together, resulting in a bite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.09.028 |pmid=21129747 |title=Mechanics of biting in great white and sandtiger sharks |journal=Journal of Biomechanics |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=430–435 |year=2011 |last1=Ferrara |first1=T.L. |last2=Clausen |first2=P. |last3=Huber |first3=D.R. |last4=McHenry |first4=C.R. |last5=Peddemors |first5=V. |last6=Wroe |first6=S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour has many implications and is exhibited by many different types of organisms, typically dangerous species such as spiders, [snakes, and sharks. Biting is one of the main functions in an organisms life providing the ability to forage, digest, build, play, protect and much more.

==Types of Teeth==
[[File:NIE 1905 Lion - teeth.jpg|thumb|Teeth of a lion, showcasing the front canines, middle carnassials, and back molars.]]
The types of teeth organisms use to bite varies throughout the [[animal|animal kingdom]]. Different types of teeth are seen in [[Herbivore|herbivores]], [[Carnivore|carnivores]], and [[Omnivore|omnivores]] as they are adapted over many years to better fit their diets. Carnivores possess canine, [[carnassial]], and [[Molar (tooth)|molar teeth]], while herbivores are equipped with [[Incisor|incisor teeth]] and wide-back molars.&lt;ref&gt;Animal Teeth | Types of Teeth | DK Find Out. (2018). Retrieved October 28, 2018, from https://www.dkfindout.com/us/animals-and-nature/food-chains/types-teeth/&lt;/ref&gt; In general, tooth shape has traditionally been used to predict dieting habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0109 |pmid=27274799 |pmc=4843622 |title=Cutting food in terrestrial carnivores and herbivores |journal=Interface Focus |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=20150109 |year=2016 |last1=Sanson |first1=Gordon }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnivores have long, extremely sharp teeth for both gripping prey and cutting meat into chunks.&lt;ref&gt;Animal Teeth | Types of Teeth | DK Find Out. (2018). Retrieved October 28, 2018, from https://www.dkfindout.com/us/animals-and-nature/food-chains/types-teeth/&lt;/ref&gt; They lack flat chewing teeth because they swallow food in chunks. An example of this is shown by the broad, serrated teeth of great white sharks which prey on large marine animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.09.028 |pmid=21129747 |title=Mechanics of biting in great white and sandtiger sharks |journal=Journal of Biomechanics |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=430–435 |year=2011 |last1=Ferrara |first1=T.L. |last2=Clausen |first2=P. |last3=Huber |first3=D.R. |last4=McHenry |first4=C.R. |last5=Peddemors |first5=V. |last6=Wroe |first6=S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, herbivores have rows of wide, flat teeth to bite and chew grass and other plants. Cows spend up to eleven hours a day biting off grass and grinding it with their molars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2008.00494.x |title=Three-dimensional computer analysis of white shark jaw mechanics: How hard can a great white bite? |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=276 |issue=4 |pages=336–342 |year=2008 |last1=Wroe |first1=S. |last2=Huber |first2=D. R. |last3=Lowry |first3=M. |last4=McHenry |first4=C. |last5=Moreno |first5=K. |last6=Clausen |first6=P. |last7=Ferrara |first7=T. L. |last8=Cunningham |first8=E. |last9=Dean |first9=M. N. |last10=Summers |first10=A. P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Omnivores consume both meat and plants, so they possess a mixture of flat teeth and sharp teeth.

==Carrying Mechanism==
Biting can serve as a carrying mechanism for species such as beavers and ants, the raw power of their species-specific teeth allow them to carry large objects.

==Dangerous Bites==
Some organisms have dangerous bites that produce toxin or venom to its victim. Snakes carry a neurotoxic venom from one of the three major groups of toxins: postsynaptically active neurotoxins, presynaptically active neurotoxics, and myotoxic agents.&lt;ref name=HarrisGoonetilleke2004&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2004.045724 |pmid=15316044 |pmc=1765666 |title=Animal poisons and the nervous system: What the neurologist needs to know |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=75 |pages=iii40–iii46 |year=2004 |last1=Harris |first1=J. B. |last2=Goonetilleke |first2=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The toxins in a spiders arsenal are polypeptides and they target specific ion channels. This excites both components of the peripheral nervous system, the somatic and autonomic systems, causing immense hyperactivity of the channels and neurotransmitter release within the peripheral nervous system.&lt;ref name=HarrisGoonetilleke2004/&gt; Spiders and snakes are commonly known for having lethal bites and are considered very fearful to humans. Spider bites or, arachnidism, are mainly a form of predation, but also means of protection. When trapped or accidently tampered with by humans, spiders retaliate with biting.&lt;ref&gt;"Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topics Venomous Spiders". cdc.gov. February 24, 2012.

Arca-Net is a European Ark-network of institutions that keep endangered [[livestock]] breeds or rare cultivated plants, making them known to the public. Arca-Net is designed for a broad public and in form of a virtual guide, at any time available via Internet. Descriptions of the institutions, directions on getting there, offers and information on the [[livestock]] breeds kept and plants cultivated, their distribution, status of endangering and their history are available from Arca-Net.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictupdate.cta.int/en/Links/Web-Resources/Arca-Net2 Issue 53: Farmer services [[ICT update]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Rare and endangered livestock breeds and old cultivated plants have largely disappeared from agricultural production units but they continue to live on numerous Ark-farms, livestock parks, variety gardens, [[open-air museums]] and other institutions. Arca-Net is unique collection of establishments conserving the traditional breeds of their region&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ela-europe.org/read/Latest%20news/ELBARN European Livestock Association/ELBARN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726020733/http://www.ela-europe.org/read/Latest%20news/ELBARN |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and makes these institutions known and initiates visits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethicalsurfing.com/eng/Map-the-territory/Agriturismo-Capra-Matilda Ethical Sufring-Agriturismo Capra Matilda]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Moreover, Arca-Net offers easily understandable background information and raises about the topic of [[agrobiodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.save-foundation.net/english/PDF/Arca-Net_overview.pdf Arca-Net overview (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724054527/http://www.save-foundation.net/english/PDF/Arca-Net_overview.pdf |date=July 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the framework of the Ark- and Rescue centre census for rare and endangered breeds in Europe, the [[SAVE Foundation]] developed the information portal Arca-Net.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arca-net.info/pages/frame.asp?sprache=en&lt;/ref&gt; Over 570 institutions in 46 [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European Countries]] (2010) are enlisted in Arca-Net. All of these facilities offer access to their [[livestock]] animals and cultivated plants such as [[fruit]] and [[vegetables]].

== Layout ==
The different institutions are presented, details for a visit described, directions explained and breed descriptions to many livestock breeds are given.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120905152237/http://www.organic-market.info/web/News_in_brief/Other_Topics/Arca-Net/176/200/0/8284.html Organic-Market.info 2010-08-09]&lt;/ref&gt; Updates and new entries are processed by the institutions themselves via password protected user accounts. Arca-Net is a Europe-wide network that is constantly expanding. 

On the search site users can search for [[livestock]] breeds, cultivated plants, countries, kind of institutions and products. The search results are either listed or displayed on a map. The Ark station map with all the locations and categories of the centres makes searching in specific regions or countries in Europe easy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clubofrome.at/varieties/news.html News June 2010 [[Club of Rome]]]&lt;/ref&gt; After selecting an institution further background information such as the complete address, animals kept, directions, opening hours, entrance fees, products for sale etc. are shown.

== Guidelines ==
Conditions for gathering data on suitable establishments for the European Network Arca-Net&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arca-net.info/pages/pdf/Arca-Net_Guidelines.pdf Arca-Net Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basic conditions ===

* The differing characteristics of the breeds and varieties should be documented (using information boards, labels or numbered to use in reference with a brochure)
* It is possible to also include interesting processing points which use traditional means to manufacture and market products from traditional breeds and varieties

=== Plants ===
* It must be a collection of, at least, regional importance
* Or an important cross-section of one species (e.g. Limonaio, Olivaio)

=== Animals ===
* Breeding groups from at least three species from two size categories (see below)
* Or an important breeding station/stud of only one breed if this establishment has a significant part of the breed
* Or an important cross-section of one species, e.g. Donkey farm with national breeds

=== Processing point ===
* Processing point open to the public (e.g. wool workshop, mill) which uses traditional and complete production methods and also declares the products accordingly

The '''Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society''' was first established in 1974 to promote philosophical conferences, workshops, summer schools, and research that are inspired by the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and the [[Vienna Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graz: Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society |url=http://philosophie-gewi.uni-graz.at/en/researching/philosophical-societies/oesterreichische-ludwig-wittgenstein-gesellschaft/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224042/http://philosophie-gewi.uni-graz.at/en/researching/philosophical-societies/oesterreichische-ludwig-wittgenstein-gesellschaft/ |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ALWS&gt;{{cite web|title=Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society|url=http://www.alws.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an international society, which also has a publication series.&lt;ref name =ontos&gt;{{cite web|title=Publications of the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society|url=http://www.ontos-verlag.de/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=21&amp;Itemid=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1974, [[Elisabeth Leinfellner]], [[Werner Leinfellner]], Rudolf Haller, Paul Weingartner, and Adolf Hübner founded the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society (ALWS), but it was the impetus of the first [[International Wittgenstein Symposium]] in [[Kirchberg am Wechsel]], [[Lower Austria]] that led to its development as an international society. The location of the ALWS is in Kirchberg am Wechsel and the location was selected because Ludwig Wittgenstein taught at elementary schools close Kirchberg am Wechsel in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=ALWS/&gt;

==Goals==

The ALWS has two primary goals. 
*To promote the analysis, tradition, and dissemination of Wittgenstein’s philosophy.  
*To promote, more generally, philosophy that has its roots in Austria and other countries with emphasis on [[analytic philosophy]] inspired by Wittgenstein and [[philosophy of science]] inspired by, but not limited to, the philosophy of the Vienna Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goals|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/alws/view/unsere_ziele/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==

They currently report 120 members both national and international.  Individuals can download an application form their website.  Membership is decided by the Executive Committee of the ALWS based on academic criteria.  Students pay half the fee.  Members receive a 30% discount on fees for the International Wittgenstein Symposium and for ALWS publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Membership|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/alws/view/mitgliedschaft/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Since the first International Wittgenstein Symposium, the ALWS has published its proceedings.  In 2006, they started a new series (published by ontos verlag). The new series contains:&lt;ref name=ontos/&gt; 
*The official proceedings of the International Wittgenstein Symposium
*Special workshops 
*High-quality publications submitted to and reviewed by the ALWS.

==International Ludwig Wittgenstein Institute (ILWI)==

The ILWI was recently founded by the ALWS and supports scientific and cultural projects that are related to Wittgenstein’s philosophy and the goals of the ALWS. The ILWI presents:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ILWI|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/ilwi/view/ilwi_general_information/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Workshops
*Summer schools
*Wittgenstein lectures
*Research opportunities at the ILWI

==Sponsorship==

The Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society is funded by the government of [[Lower Austria]], the Austrian Federal Ministry for Science and Research, Austrian National Bank, Raiffeisenbank NÖ-Süd Alpin, Kirchberg am Wechsel, membership fees, and donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sponsors|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/credit/view/sponsoren/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''BTO'''&lt;ref name="Gremse2011"&gt;Gremse, M., Chang, A., Schomburg, I., Grote, A., Scheer, M., Ebeling, C., Schomburg, D. (2011): „[http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/suppl_1/D507.long The BRENDA Tissue Ontology (BTO): the first all-integrating ontology of all organisms for enzyme sources]“, ''Nucleic Acids Res.'', 39 (Database issue): D507–D513&lt;/ref&gt; ('''B'''RENDA '''T'''issue '''O'''ntology) represents a comprehensive structured [[encyclopedia]]. It provides terms, classifications, and definitions of [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], anatomical structures, plant parts, [[cell culture]]s, [[cell type]]s, and [[cell culture|cell lines]] of organisms from all taxonomic groups ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungis]], [[protozoa|protozoon]]) as enzyme sources. The information is connected to the functional data in the [[BRENDA]] ("BRaunschweig ENzyme DAtabase“)&lt;ref name="Schomburg20132"&gt;Schomburg, I., Chang, A., Placzek, S., Söhngen, C., Rother. M., Lang, M., Munaretto, C., Ulas, S., Stelzer, M., Grote, A., Scheer, M., Schomburg, D. (2013): „[http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/D1/D764.long BRENDA in 2013: integrated reactions, kinetic data, enzyme function data, improved disease classification: new options and contents in BRENDA]“, ''Nucleic Acids Res.'', 41 (Database issue): D764–D772&lt;/ref&gt; [[enzyme]] information system.

BTO is one of the first tissue-specific [[ontology|ontologies]] in [[life sciences]], not restricted to a specific organism or a specific organism group providing a user-friendly access to the wide range of tissue and cell-type information. Databases, such as ''Ontology Lookup Service'' or ses, such as ''[[MIRIAM Registry]]'' or  of the [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI-EMBL]], the ''TissueDistributionDB'', including the ''Tissue Synonym Library'' of the [[German Cancer Research Center]] (DKFZ) in Heidelberg or the ''Bioportal'' plattform of the [[National Center for Biomedical Ontology]] in Stanford, USA rely on BTO and implement the encyclopedia as an essential repository of information into their respective plattform.

BTO enables users from [[medical research]] and [[pharmaceutical sciences]] to search for the occurrence and [[histology|histological]] detection of disease-related enzymes in tissues, which play an important role in [[diagnosis]], therapies, and [[drug development]]. In [[biochemistry]] and [[biotechnology]] the organism-specific tissue terms linked to enzyme functional data are an important resource for the understanding of the metabolism and regulation in life sciences. Ontologies represent classification systems that provide controlled and structured vocabularies.&lt;ref name="Schomburg2014"&gt;Schomburg, I., Chang, A., Schomburg, D. (2014): „[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213020914000032 Standardization in enzymology—Data integration in the world’s enzyme information system BRENDA]“, ''Perspectives in Science'', 1: 15–23&lt;/ref&gt; They are important tools to illustrate and to link evolutionary correlations.

Development of BTO started in 2003, aimed to connect the biochemical and molecular biological enzyme data of BRENDA with a hierarchical and standardized collection of tissue-specific terms. The functional enzyme data and information in BRENDA have been manually annotated and structured by experts from biochemistry, biology, and chemistry. By August 2014, the BTO contained over 5,500 terms, linked to 4,000 synonyms and 4,500 definitions. The terms are classified under generic categories, rules, and formats of the Gene Ontology Consortium (GO,&lt;ref name="Roncaglia2013"&gt;Roncaglia, P., Martone, M.E., Hill, D.P., Berardini, T.Z., Foulger, R.E., Imam, F.T., Drabkin, H., Mungall, C.J., Lomax, J. (2013): „[http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/4/1/20 The Gene Ontology (GO) Cellular Component Ontology: integration with SAO (Subcellular Anatomy Ontology) and other recent developments]“, ''J. Biomed. Semantics'', 4: 20&lt;/ref&gt;), organized as a [[Directed acyclic graph|directed acyclic graph (DAG)]] created using the [[Open-source software|open-source]] OBO-Edit.&lt;ref name="Smith2010"&gt;Smith, B., Ashburner, M., Rosse, C., Bard, J., Bug, W., Ceusters, W., Goldberg, L.J., Eilbeck, K., Ireland, A., Mungall, C.J.; OBI Consortium, Leontis, N., Rocca-Serra, P., Ruttenberg, A., Sansone, S.A., Scheuermann, R.H., Shah, N., Whetzel,P.L,, Lewis, S. (2010): „[http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v25/n11/full/nbt1346.html The OBO Foundry: coordinated evolution of ontologies to support biomedical data integration]“, ''Nat.
Biotechnol.'', 25: 1251–1255&lt;/ref&gt; All terms from each level are directly connected the enzyme data in BRENDA. BTO is a suitable tool to distinguish between different enzymes which are expressed in a tissue-specific manner.

== Content and Features ==

BTO draws upon the comprehensive enzyme specific data of the BRENDA enzyme information system. Presently (August 2014) 90,500 enzyme-organism-tissue specific data from more than 11,000 proteins are stored in BRENDA. These entries were manually annotated from more thant 135,000 different literature references. All terms in BTO are evaluated and classified according to the OBO-format, and are connected by specific relationships. Each term is a distinct entry within the ontology and is automatically assigned to  a unique BTO-identifier (BTO-ID). The BTO-IDs serve as stable accession numbers in order to create cross-references to further external biochemical databases. Further tissue und cell-type specific terms from external databases (i.e. [[UniProt]]) are integrated into BTO.

The terms are classified in 4 main categories (subgraphs):

* animal
* plant
* fungus
* other sources

Further levels are defined below the main categories (=nodes), classifiying the “parent”, “child”, and “grandchild” all connected via specific relationships (=edges)

* is_a (e.g. skeletal muscle fibre is_a muscle fibre)
* part_of (e.g. muscle fibre part_of muscle)
* develops/derives_from (e.g.myoma cell develops/derives_from muscle fibre)
* related_to (description of more general relationships between terms which are not covered by the other ones)

Most of the terms are clearly associated with specific organisms, organs, tissues, or cell types. However, there are several  identical designations for tissues both in plants and animals, e.g. “epidermis”. To distinguish between those tissue terms and to classify them correctly into BTO for plant tissues the prefix “plant” is placed before the term, e.g. “plant epidermis”.

More than 80% of the tissue terms have definitions that describe the meaning and context. These definitions are obtained from i.e. medical dictionaries and cell line databases ([[Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary|Webster’s Dictionary]], [[Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen|DSMZ]]).

== Availability ==

The entries in BTO are updated bi-annually as part of the major update of BRENDA. It is available via the BRENDA website in the category “Ontology Explorer”. The enzyme source terms can be searched via the BTO query form. As a result, the user receives a list of EC numbers which are directly connected to  the enzyme information of BRENDA. It is also possible to search via the BRENDA “Source Tissue” search form (“Classic View”). The result page displays all enzymes which are isolated or detected in the searched tissue term, directly linked to BTO.

BTO and BRENDA are freely accessible for academic users. It can be freely downloaded via the “Ontology Explorer” of the BRENDA website or in the OBO format from “Obofoundry”. Commercial users require a license distributed by the ''biobase GmbH''.

'''Bioturbation''' is defined as the reworking of [[soil]]s and [[sediment]]s by animals or plants. These include burrowing, ingestion and defecation of sediment grains. Bioturbating activities have a profound effect on the environment and &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  are thought to be a primary driver of [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The formal study of bioturbation began in the 1800s by [[Charles Darwin]] experimenting in his garden.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The disruption of aquatic sediments and terrestrial soils through bioturbating activities provides significant [[ecosystem services]]. These include the alteration of [[nutrient]]s in aquatic sediment and overlying water, shelter to other species in the form of burrows in terrestrial and water ecosystems, and soil production on land.&lt;ref name="shaler1891"&gt;Shaler, N. S., 1891, The origin and nature of soils, in Powell, J. W., ed., USGS 12th Annual report 1890-1891: Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, p. 213-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

Bioturbators are deemed [[ecosystem engineer]]s because they alter resource availability to other species through the physical changes they make to their environments.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; This type of ecosystem change affects the evolution of cohabitating species and the environment,&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; which is evident in [[trace fossil]]s left in marine and terrestrial sediments. Other bioturbation effects include altering the texture of sediments [[diagenesis|(diagenesis]]), [[bioirrigation]], and displacement of microorganisms and non-living particles. Bioturbation is sometimes confused with the process of bioirrigation, however these processes differ in what they are mixing; bioirrigation refers to the mixing of water and solutes in sediments and is an effect of bioturbation.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

== History of the Study of Bioturbation ==
Bioturbation's importance for soil processes and [[geomorphology]] was ﬁrst realized by Charles Darwin, who devoted his last scientific book to the subject (''[[The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms]]'').&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Darwin spread chalk dust over a field to observe changes in the depth of the chalk layer over time.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Excavations 30 years after the initial deposit of chalk revealed that the chalk was buried 18 centimeters under the sediment, which indicated a burial rate of 6 millimeters per year.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Darwin attributed this burial to the activity of earthworms in the sediment and determined that these disruptions were important in soil formation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Marshall T.|last2=Richards|first2=Paul J.|last3=Humphreys|first3=Geoff S.|date=2009-12-01|title=Breaking ground: Pedological, geological, and ecological implications of soil bioturbation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825209001470|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=97|issue=1|pages=257–272|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.09.005|bibcode=2009ESRv...97..257W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, geologist [[Nathaniel Shaler]] expanded Darwin's concept to include soil disruption by ants and trees.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shaler1891" /&gt; The term "bioturbation" was later coined by Rudolf Richter in 1952 to describe structures in sediment caused by living organisms.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kristensen|first=E|last2=Penha-Lopes|first2=G|last3=Delefosse|first3=M|last4=Valdemarsen|first4=T|last5=Quintana|first5=CO|last6=Banta|first6=GT|date=2012-02-02|title=What is bioturbation?

== Evolution and Ecology ==

=== Evolution  ===
The onset of bioturbation had a profound effect on the environment and the evolution of other organisms.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meysman|first=F|last2=Meddelburg|first2=J|last3=Heip|first3=C|date=|title=Bioturbation: a fresh look at Darwin's last idea|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534706002436|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=21|issue=12|pages=688–695|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.08.002|via=|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbation is thought to have been an important co-factor of the [[Cambrian explosion|Cambrian Explosion]], during which most major animal [[Phylum|phyla]] appeared in the fossil record over a short time.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; [[Predation]] arose during this time and promoted the development of hard skeletons, for example bristles, spines, and shells, as a form of [[armored]] protection.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It is hypothesized that bioturbation resulted from this skeleton formation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  These new hard parts enabled animals to dig into the sediment to seek shelter from predators, which created an incentive for predators to search for prey in the sediment (see [[Evolutionary arms race|Evolutionary Arms Race]]).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Burrowing species fed on buried organic matter in the sediment which resulted in the evolution of deposit feeding (consumption of organic matter within sediment).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Prior to the development of bioturbation, laminated [[microbial mat]]s were the dominant biological structures of the ocean floor and drove much of the [[Ecosystem|ecosystem functions]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; As bioturbation increased, burrowing animals disturbed the microbial mat system and created a mixed sediment layer with greater biological and chemical diversity.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This greater biological and chemical diversity is thought to have led to the evolution and diversification of seafloor-dwelling species.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

An alternate, less widely accepted hypothesis for the origin of bioturbation exists. The [[trace fossil]] ''Nenoxites'' is thought to be the earliest record of bioturbation, predating the Cambrian Period.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogov|first=Vladimir|last2=Marusin|first2=Vasiliy|last3=Bykova|first3=Natalia|last4=Goy|first4=Yuriy|last5=Nagovitsin|first5=Konstantin|last6=Kochnev|first6=Boris|last7=Karlova|first7=Galina|last8=Grazhdankin|first8=Dmitriy|date=2012-05-01|title=The oldest evidence of bioturbation on Earth|url=http://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/geology/article/40/5/395/130862/The-oldest-evidence-of-bioturbation-on-Earth|journal=Geology|language=en|volume=40|issue=5|pages=395–398|doi=10.1130/g32807.1|issn=0091-7613|bibcode=2012Geo....40..395R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fossil is dated to 555 million years, which places it in the [[Ediacaran|Ediacaran Period.]]&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The fossil indicates a 5 centimeter depth of bioturbation in muddy sediments by a burrowing worm.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This is consistent with food-seeking behavior, as there tended to be more food resources in the mud than the water column.&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gingras|first=Murray|last2=Hagadorn|first2=James W.|last3=Seilacher|first3=Adolf|last4=Lalonde|first4=Stefan V.|last5=Pecoits|first5=Ernesto|last6=Petrash|first6=Daniel|last7=Konhauser|first7=Kurt O.|date=2011-05-15|title=Possible evolution of mobile animals in association with microbial mats|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ngeo1142|journal=Nature Geoscience|language=en|volume=4|issue=6|pages=372–375|doi=10.1038/ngeo1142|issn=1752-0908|bibcode=2011NatGe...4..372G}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this hypothesis requires more precise [[Geochronology|geological dating]] to rule out an early Cambrian origin for this specimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brasier|first=Martin D.|last2=McIlroy|first2=Duncan|last3=Liu|first3=Alexander G.|last4=Antcliffe|first4=Jonathan B.|last5=Menon|first5=Latha R.|title=The oldest evidence of bioturbation on Earth: COMMENT|url=http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1130%2FG33606C.1|journal=Geology|volume=41|issue=5|pages=e289–e289|doi=10.1130/g33606c.1|year=2013|bibcode=2013Geo....41E.289B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of trees during the [[Devonian|Devonian Period]] enhanced soil weathering and increased the spread of soil due to bioturbation by tree roots.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Algeo|first=Thomas J.|last2=Scheckler|first2=Stephen E.|date=1998-01-29|title=Terrestrial-marine teleconnections in the Devonian: links between the evolution of land plants, weathering processes, and marine anoxic events|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/353/1365/113|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=353|issue=1365|pages=113–130|doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0195|issn=0962-8436|pmc=1692181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Root penetration and uprooting also enhanced soil carbon storage by enabling mineral weathering and the burial of organic matter.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

=== Ecosystem function ===
==== Functional Groupings ====
Bioturbators have been organized by a variety of functional groupings based on either ecological characteristics or biogeochemical effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michaud|first=Emma|last2=Desrosiers|first2=Gaston|last3=Mermillod-Blondin|first3=Florian|last4=Sundby|first4=Bjorn|last5=Stora|first5=Georges|date=2006-10-03|title=The functional group approach to bioturbation: II.

Examples of categorizations include those based on feeding and motility,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fauchald|first=K|last2=Jumars|first2=P|date=1979|title=Diet of worms: a study of polychaete feeding guilds|url=|journal=Oceanography and Marine Biology|volume=17|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; feeding and biological interactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Josefson|first=Alf B.|date=1985-12-30|title=Distribution of diversity and functional groups of marine benthic infauna in the Skagerrak (eastern North Sea) - Can larval availability affect diversity?|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00364827.1985.10419680|journal=Sarsia|volume=70|issue=4|pages=229–249|doi=10.1080/00364827.1985.10419680|issn=0036-4827}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mobility modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Posey|first=MH|title=Influence of relative mobilities on the composition of benthic communities|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/39/m039p099.pdf|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=39|pages=99–104|doi=10.3354/meps039099|year=1987|bibcode=1987MEPS...39...99P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common set of groupings are based on sediment transport and are as follows: 
* '''Gallery-diffusers''' create complex tube networks within the upper sediment layers and transport sediment through feeding, burrow construction, and general movement throughout their galleries.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47927758|title=Organism-sediment interactions|last=|first=|date=2001|publisher=Published for the Belle W.

*'''Biodiffusers''' transport sediment particles randomly over short distances as they move through sediments. Animals mostly attributed to this category include [[Bivalvia|bivalves]] such as clams, and [[Amphipoda|amphipod]] species, but can also include larger vertebrates, such as bottom-dwelling fish and rays that feed along the sea floor.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Biodiffusers can be further divided into two subgroups, which include [[epifaunal]] (organisms that live on the surface sediments) biodiffusers and surface biodiffusers.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; This subgrouping may also include gallery-diffusers,&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; reducing the number of functional groups.
*'''Upward-conveyors''' are oriented head-down in sediments, where they feed at depth and transport sediment through their guts to the sediment surface.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Major upward-conveyor groups include burrowing [[polychaete]]s like the [[lugworm]], ''Arenicola marina,'' and [[Thalassinidea|thalassinid]] shrimps.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andersen|first=FO|last2=Kristensen|first2=E|date=1991|title=Effects of burrowing macrofauna on organic matter decomposition in coastal marine sediments|url=|journal=Symp. zool.

*'''Downward-conveyor''' species are oriented with their heads towards the [[sediment-water interface]] and defecation occurs at depth.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Their activities transport sediment from the surface to deeper sediment layers as they feed.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Notable downward-conveyors include those in the [[Sipuncula|peanut worm]] family, [[Sipunculidae]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;[[File:Arenicola marina 2010.JPG|alt=Lugworm|thumb|185x185px|The lugworm, ''Arenicola marina.'']]
* '''Regenerators''' are categorized by their ability to release sediment to the overlying water column, which is then dispersed as they burrow.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; After regenerators abandon their burrows, water flow at the sediment surface can push in and collapse the burrow.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Examples of regenerator species include [[Fiddler crab|fiddler]] and [[Ghost crab|ghost]] crabs.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

== Biogeochemical Effects of Bioturbation ==
Since its onset around 541 million years ago, bioturbation has been responsible for changes in ocean chemistry, primarily through nutrient cycling.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canfield|first=Donald E.|last2=Farquhar|first2=James|date=2009-05-19|title=Animal evolution, bioturbation, and the sulfate concentration of the oceans|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8123|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=20|pages=8123–8127|doi=10.1073/pnas.0902037106|issn=0027-8424|pmid=19451639|pmc=2688866|bibcode=2009PNAS..106.8123C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbators played, and continue to play, an important role in nutrient transport across sediments.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

For example, bioturbating animals are hypothesized to have affected the cycling of sulfur in the early oceans. According to this hypothesis, bioturbating activities had a large effect on the sulfate concentration in the ocean. Around the Cambrian-Precambrian boundary (541 million years ago), animals begin to mix reduced sulfur from ocean sediments to overlying water causing sulfide to oxidize, which increased the sulfate composition in the ocean. During large extinction events, the sulfate concentration in the ocean was reduced. Although this is difficult to measure directly, seawater sulfur isotope compositions during these times indicates bioturbators influenced the sulfur cycling in the early Earth.

Bioturbators have also altered phosphorus cycling on geologic scales.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dale|first1=A.W|date=2016|title=A model for microbial phosphorus cycling in bioturbated marine sediments: Significance for phosphorus burial in the early Paleozoic|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=189|pages=251–268|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2016.05.046|bibcode=2016GeCoA.189..251D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbators mix readily available particulate organic phosphorus (P) deeper into ocean sediment layers which prevents the precipitation of phosphorus [[Mineralization (biology)|(mineralization)]] by increasing the sequestration of phosphorus above normal chemical rates. The sequestration of phosphorus limits oxygen concentrations by decreasing production on a geologic time scale.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; This decrease in production results in an overall decrease in oxygen levels, and it has been proposed that the rise of bioturbation corresponds to a decrease in oxygen levels of that time.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyle|first1=R.A.|date=2014|title=Stabilization of the coupled oxygen and phosphorus cycles by the evolution of bioturbation|volume=7|page=671|doi=10.1038/ngeo2213|journal=Nature Geoscience|bibcode=2014NatGe...7..671B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative feedback of animals sequestering phosphorus in the sediments and subsequently reducing oxygen concentrations in the environment limits the intensity of bioturbation in this early environment.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

Nutrient cycling is still affected by bioturbation in the modern Earth. Some examples in the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are below.

=== Aquatic ===
==== Terrestrial freshwater ecosystems ====
Important sources of bioturbation in freshwater ecosystems include [[Bottom feeder|benthivorous]] (bottom-dwelling) fish, macroinvertebrates such as worms, insect larvae, crustaceans and molluscs, and seasonal influences from [[Fish migration|anadromous]] (migrating) fish such as salmon. Anadromous fish migrate from the sea into fresh-water rivers and streams to spawn. Macroinvertebrates act as biological pumps for moving material between the sediments and water column, feeding on sediment organic matter and transporting mineralized nutrients into the water column.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adámek|first=Zdeněk|last2=Maršálek|first2=Blahoslav|date=2013-02-01|title=Bioturbation of sediments by benthic macroinvertebrates and fish and its implication for pond ecosystems: a review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10499-012-9527-3|journal=Aquaculture International|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1007/s10499-012-9527-3|issn=0967-6120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both benthivorous and anadromous fish can affect ecosystems by decreasing primary production through sediment re-suspension,&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; the subsequent displacement of benthic primary producers, and recycling nutrients from the sediment back into the water column.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsuzaki|first=Shin-ichiro S.|last2=Usio|first2=Nisikawa|last3=Takamura|first3=Noriko|last4=Washitani|first4=Izumi|date=2007-01-01|title=Effects of common carp on nutrient dynamics and littoral community composition: roles of excretion and bioturbation|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/schweiz/fal/2007/00000168/00000001/art00004|journal=Fundamental and Applied Limnology / Archiv f??r Hydrobiologie|volume=168|issue=1|pages=27–38|doi=10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0168-0027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holtgrieve|first=Gordon W.|last2=Schindler|first2=Daniel E.|date=2011-02-01|title=Marine-derived nutrients, bioturbation, and ecosystem metabolism: reconsidering the role of salmon in streams|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/09-1694.1/abstract|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=92|issue=2|pages=373–385|doi=10.1890/09-1694.1|issn=1939-9170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lakes and ponds ====
[[File:Chironomidae.jpg|thumb|Chironomid larvae.]]
The sediments of lake and pond ecosystems are rich in organic matter, with higher organic matter and nutrient contents in the sediments than in the overlying water.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Nutrient re-regeneration through sediment bioturbation moves nutrients into the water column, thereby enhancing the growth of aquatic plants and phytoplankton ([[primary producers]]).&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The major nutrients of interest in this flux are nitrogen and phosphorus, which often limit the levels of primary production in an ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Bioturbation increases the flux of mineralized (inorganic) forms of these elements, which can be directly used by primary producers. In addition, bioturbation increases the water column concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus-containing organic matter, which can then be consumed by fauna and mineralized.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Lake and pond sediments often transition from the aerobic (oxygen containing) character of the overlaying water to the anaerobic (without oxygen) conditions of the lower sediment over sediment depths of only a few millimeters, therefore, even bioturbators of modest size can affect this transition of the chemical characteristics of sediments.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; By mixing anaerobic sediments into the water column, bioturbators allow aerobic processes to interact with the re-suspended sediments and the newly exposed bottom sediment surfaces.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Macroinvertebrates including [[Chironomidae|chironomid]] (non-biting midges) larvae and [[Tubifex tubifex|tubificed worms]] (detritus worms) are important agents of bioturbation in these ecosystems and have different effects based on their respective feeding habits. Tubificed worms do not form burrows, they are upward conveyors. Chironomids, on the other hand, form burrows in the sediment, acting as bioirrigators and aerating the sediments and are downward conveyors. This activity, combined with chironomid's respiration within their burrows, decrease available oxygen in the sediment and increase the loss of nitrates through enhanced rates of [[denitrification]].&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The increased oxygen input to sediments by macroinvertebrate bioirrigation coupled with bioturbation at the sediment-water interface complicates the total flux of phosphorus . While bioturbation results in a net flux of phosphorus into the water column, the bio-irrigation of the sediments with oxygenated water enhances the adsorption of phosphorus onto iron-oxide compounds, thereby reducing the total flux of phosphorus into the water column.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The presence of macroinvertebrates in sediment can initiate bioturbation due to their status as an important food source for benthivorous fish such as [[Common carp|carp]].&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Of the bioturbating, benthivorous fish species, carp in particular are important ecosystem engineers and their foraging and burrowing activities can alter the water quality characteristics of ponds and lakes.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Carp increase water [[turbidity]] by the re-suspension of benthic sediments. This increased turbidity limits light penetration and coupled with increased nutrient flux from the sediment into the water column, inhibits the growth of macrophytes (aquatic plants) favoring the growth of phytoplankton in the surface waters. Surface phytoplankton colonies benefit from both increased suspended nutrients and from recruitment of buried phytoplankton cells released from the sediments by the fish bioturbation.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Macrophyte growth has also been shown to be inhibited by displacement from the bottom sediments due to fish burrowing.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

==== Rivers and streams ====
River and stream ecosystems show similar responses to bioturbation activities, with chironomid larvae and tubificid worm macroinvertebrates remaining as important benthic agents of bioturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mermillod-Blondin|first=Florian|last2=Gaudet|first2=Jean-Paul|last3=Gerino|first3=Magali|last4=Desrosiers|first4=Gaston|last5=Jose|first5=Jacques|last6=Châtelliers|first6=Michel Creuzé des|date=2004-07-01|title=Relative influence of bioturbation and predation on organic matter processing in river sediments: a microcosm experiment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01233.x/abstract|journal=Freshwater Biology|language=en|volume=49|issue=7|pages=895–912|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01233.x|issn=1365-2427}}&lt;/ref&gt; These environments are can also be subject to strong season bioturbation effects from anadromous fish.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Salmon function as bioturbators on both gravel to sand-sized sediment and a nutrient scale, by moving and re-working sediments in the construction of redds (gravel depressions or "nests" containing eggs buried under a thin layer of sediment) in rivers and streams&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gottesfeld|first=AS|last2=Hassan|first2=MA|last3=Tunnicliffe|first3=JF|date=2008|title=Salmon bioturbation and stream process|url=|journal=American Fisheries Society Symposium|volume=65|pages=|via=researchgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by mobilization of nutrients.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buxton|first=Todd H.|last2=Buffington|first2=John M.|last3=Tonina|first3=Daniele|last4=Fremier|first4=Alexander K.|last5=Yager|first5=Elowyn M.|date=2015-04-13|title=Modeling the influence of salmon spawning on hyporheic exchange of marine-derived nutrients in gravel stream beds|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2014-0413|journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|volume=72|issue=8|pages=1146–1158|doi=10.1139/cjfas-2014-0413|issn=0706-652X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of salmon redds functions to increase the ease of fluid movement ([[hydraulic conductivity]]) and porosity of the stream bed.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In select rivers, if salmon congregate in large enough concentrations in a given area of the river, the total sediment transport from redd construction can equal or exceed the sediment transport from flood events.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The net effect on sediment movement is the downstream transfer of gravel, sand and finer materials and enhancement of water mixing within the river substrate.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The construction of salmon redds increases sediment and nutrient fluxes through the [[hyporheic zone]] (area between surface water and groundwater) of rivers and effects the dispersion and retention of marine derived nutrients (MDN) within the river ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; MDN are delivered to river and stream ecosystems by the fecal matter of spawning salmon and the decaying carcasses of salmon that have completed spawning and died.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Numerical modeling suggests that residence time of MDN within a salmon spawning reach is inversely proportional to the amount of redd construction within the river.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Measurements of respiration within a salmon-bearing river in Alaska further suggest that salmon bioturbation of the river bed plays a significant role in mobilizing MDN and limiting primary productivity while salmon spawning is active.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The river ecosystem was found to switch from a net [[autotroph]]ic to [[heterotroph]]ic system in response to decreased primary production and increased respiration.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The decreased primary production in this study was attributed to the loss of benthic primary producers who were dislodged due to bioturbation, while increased respiration was thought to be due to increased respiration of organic carbon, also attributed to sediment mobilization from salmon redd construction.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; While marine derived nutrients are generally thought to increase productivity in riparian and freshwater ecosystems, several studies have suggested that temporal effects of bioturbation should be considered when characterizing salmon influences on nutrient cycles.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== Marine environments ====
Major marine bioturbators range from small [[Sediment-dwelling organism|infaunal]] invertebrates to fish and marine mammals.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In most marine sediments, however, they are dominated by small invertebrates, including polychaetes, bivalves, burrowing shrimp, and amphipods.

===== Shallow and Coastal =====
Coastal ecosystems, such as estuaries, are generally highly productive, which results in the accumulation of large quantities of [[detritus]] (organic waste). These large quantities, in addition to typically small sediment grain size and dense populations, make bioturbators important in estuarine respiration.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/798834896|title=Interactions between macro- and microorganisms in marine sediments|date=2005|publisher=American Geophysical Union|others=American Geophysical Union.|isbn=9781118665442|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=798834896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbators enhance the transport of oxygen into sediments through irrigation and increase the surface area of oxygenated sediments through burrow construction.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; Bioturbators also transport organic matter deeper into sediments through general reworking activities and production of fecal matter.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; This ability to replenish oxygen and other solutes at sediment depth allows for enhanced respiration by both bioturbators as well as the microbial community, thus altering estuarine elemental cycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nitrogen Cycling in Coastal Marine Environments|last=Aller|first=Robert C.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|year=1988|isbn=|editor-last=Blackburn|editor-first=T.H.|location=|pages=301–338|chapter=13.

==== Role in Organic Contaminant Flux ====
Bioturbation can either enhance or reduce the [[flux]] of contaminants from the sediment to the water column, depending on the mechanism of sediment transport.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Josefsson|first=Sarah|last2=Leonardsson|first2=Kjell|last3=Gunnarsson|first3=Jonas S.|last4=Wiberg|first4=Karin|date=2010|title=Bioturbation-driven release of buried PCBs and PBDEs from different depths in contaminated sediments|url=|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=44|pages=7456–7464|doi=10.1021/es100615g|via=|bibcode=2010EnST...44.7456J}}&lt;/ref&gt; In polluted sediments, bioturbating animals can mix the surface layer and cause the release of sequestered contaminants into the water column.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Granberg|first=Maria E.|last2=Gunnarsson|first2=Jonas S.|last3=Hedman|first3=Jenny E.|last4=Rosenberg|first4=Rutger|last5=Jonsson|first5=Per|date=2008|title=Bioturbation-driven release of organic contaminants from Baltic Sea sediments mediated by the invading polychaete Marenzelleria neglecta|url=|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=42|pages=1058–1065|doi=10.1021/es071607j|via=|bibcode=2008EnST...42.1058G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thibodeaux|first=Louis J.|last2=Bierman|first2=Victor J.|date=2003|title=The bioturbation-driven chemical release process|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es032518j|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.1021/es032518j|bibcode=2003EnST...37..252T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upward-conveyor species, like polychaete worms, are efficient at moving contaminated particles to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reible|first=D.D.|last2=Popov|first2=V.|last3=Valsaraj|first3=K.T.|last4=Thibodeaux|first4=L.J.|last5=Lin|first5=F.|last6=Dikshit|first6=M.|last7=Todaro|first7=M.A.|last8=Fleeger|first8=J.W.|date=1996|title=Contaminant fluxes from sediment due to tubificid oligochaete bioturbation|url=|journal=Water Research|volume=30|issue=3|pages=704–714|via=|doi=10.1016/0043-1354(95)00187-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Invasive species|Invasive]] animals can remobilize contaminants previously considered to be buried at a safe depth.

=== Terrestrial ===
[[File:Camas pocket gopher mounds.JPG|thumb|Pocket gopher mounds |256x256px]]
Plants and animals utilize soil for food and shelter, disturbing the upper soil layers and transporting chemically weathered rock called [[saprolite]] from the lower soil depths to the surface.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Terrestrial bioturbation is important in soil production, burial, organic matter content, and downslope transport. Tree roots are sources of [[soil organic matter]], with root growth and stump decay also contributing to soil transport and mixing.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Death and decay of tree roots first delivers organic matter to the soil and then creates voids, decreasing soil density. Tree uprooting causes considerable soil displacement by producing mounds, mixing the soil, or inverting [[Soil profile|vertical sections of soil.]]&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

Burrowing animals, such as earth worms and small mammals form passageways for air and water transport which changes the soil properties, such as the vertical particle-size distribution, soil [[porosity]], and nutrient content.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Invertebrates that burrow and consume plant detritus help produce an organic-rich topsoil known as the [[soil biomantle]], and thus contribute to the formation of [[Soil horizon|soil horizons.]]&lt;ref name="shaler1891" /&gt; Small mammals such as [[pocket gophers]] also play an important role in the production of soil, possibly with an equal magnitude to abiotic processes.&lt;ref name=":38"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reichman|first=O.J.|last2=Seabloom|first2=Eric W.|title=The role of pocket gophers as subterranean ecosystem engineers|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534701023291|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=17|issue=1|pages=44–49|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02329-1|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pocket gophers form above-ground mounds, which moves soil from the lower soil horizons to the surface, exposing minimally weathered rock to surface erosion processes, speeding soil formation.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Pocket gophers are thought to play an important role in the downslope transport of soil, as the soil that forms their mounds is more susceptible to erosion and subsequent transport. Similar to tree root effects, the construction of burrows-even when backfilled- decreases soil density.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt; The formation of surface mounds also buries surface vegetation, creating nutrient hotspots when the vegetation decomposes, increasing soil organic matter. Due to the high metabolic demands of their burrow-excavating subterranean lifestyle, pocket gophers must consume large amounts of plant material.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt; Though this has a detrimental effect on individual plants, the net effect of pocket gophers is increased plant growth from their positive effects on soil nutrient content and physical soil properties.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt;

== In the fossil record ==
[[File:Planolites.jpg|thumb|Planolite fossil]]

=== In the sediment record ===
Patterns or traces of bioturbation are preserved in [[Lithification|lithified]] rock. The study of such patterns is called [[ichnology]], or the study of "trace fossils", which, in the case of bioturbators, are fossils left behind by digging or burrowing animals. This can be compared to the footprint left behind by these animals. In some cases bioturbation is so pervasive that it completely obliterates [[sedimentary structures]], such as laminated layers or [[cross-bedding]]. Thus, it affects the disciplines of [[sedimentology]] and [[stratigraphy]] within geology. The study of bioturbator ichnofabrics uses the depth of the fossils, the cross-cutting of fossils, and the sharpness (or how well defined) of the fossil&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=A. M.|last2=Goldring|first2=R.|date=|title=Description and analysis of bioturbation and ichnofabric|url=https://doi.org/10.1144/gsjgs.150.1.0141|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|volume=150|issue=1|pages=141–148|doi=10.1144/gsjgs.150.1.0141|via=|year=1993|bibcode=1993JGSoc.150..141T}}&lt;/ref&gt; to assess the activity that occurred in old sediments. Typically the deeper the fossil, the better preserved and well defined the specimen.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Important [[trace fossil]]s from bioturbation have been found in marine sediments from tidal, coastal and deep sea sediments. In addition sand dune, or [[Eolian dust|Eolian]], sediments are important for preserving a wide variety of fossils.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; Evidence of bioturbation has been found in deep-sea sediment cores including into long records, although the act extracting the core can disturb the signs of bioturbation, especially at shallower depths.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hertweck|first1=G|last2=Liebezeit|first2=G|title=Bioturbation structures of polychaetes in modern shallow marine environments and their analogues to Chondrites group traces|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date=2007|volume=245|issue=3|pages=382–389|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2006.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthropods, in particular are important to the geologic record of bioturbation of Eolian sediments.

== Mathematical Models ==
The role of bioturbators in sediment biogeochemistry makes bioturbation a common parameter in sediment biogeochemical models, which are often [[Numerical modeling (geology)|numerical models]] built using [[Ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[partial differential equation]]s.&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851842693|title=Diagenetic Models and Their Implementation : Modelling Transport and Reactions in Aquatic Sediments|last=P.|first=Boudreau, Bernard|date=1997|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=364264399X|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|oclc=851842693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbation is typically represented as D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, or the biodiffusion coefficient, and is described by a [[Diffusion equation|diffusion]] and, sometimes, an [[Advective derivative|advective]] term.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt; This representation and subsequent variations account for the different modes of mixing by functional groups and bioirrigation that results from them.

'''Christopher Newport University''', '''CNU''', is a public [[Liberal Arts College|liberal arts university]] in [[Newport News]], [[Virginia]]. CNU is the youngest comprehensive university in the commonwealth of Virginia. The institution is named after [[Christopher Newport]], who was a [[buccaneer]] (or [[privateer]]) and captain of the ''[[Susan Constant]]'', the largest of three ships which carried settlers for the [[Virginia Company]] in 1607, on their way to found [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in the [[Virginia Colony]], which became the first permanent [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlement in North America.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CNUmcmurran.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Making "History" as the new McMurran Hall is opened on the night of Monday, January 4, 2010 --&gt;

In 1960 the city of Newport News joined together with the [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] to create Christopher Newport College (CNC), which opened its doors in 1961&lt;ref&gt;[http://about.cnu.edu/history.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007010819/http://about.cnu.edu/history.cfm |date=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the time was located in the old [[John W. Daniel]] School building. The college was founded as an extension of the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] and offered extension courses that had already been available in the area for some time. In 1964 the college was relocated to its current location, a {{convert|75|acre|m2|adj=on}} tract of land purchased and donated by the city. In this same year, the college's first permanent building was dedicated as Christopher Newport Hall. In 1971, CNC became a four-year college;&lt;ref name="Q179"&gt;(Quarstein 179)&lt;/ref&gt; however, it remained an extension of William &amp; Mary until 1977 when it attained its independence.&lt;ref&gt;(Quarstein 209)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the college became a university under the leadership of President Anthony R. Santoro, who oversaw the building of the first residence hall.
In 1996, CNU made plans to become more competitive. Those plans included the expansion of University property, several new buildings and residence halls, as well as overhauling academic programs and the admission process.

==Athletics==
{{main|Christopher Newport Captains}}
CNU participates mainly in the [[Capital Athletic Conference]] (CAC), having moved from the [[USA South Athletic Conference]] in July 2013. The football team remains a USA South associate member because the CAC does not sponsor football. CNU fields a wide variety of college level teams on the Division III level. The Freeman Center houses the basketball, volleyball, and indoor track teams, while the lacrosse, soccer, baseball, softball, and field hockey teams play at a complex called "Captain's Field." The football and outdoor track teams compete at [[Pomoco Stadium]], named for a local car dealership chain. Ratcliffe Hall was expanded in 2012 and now includes various athletic offices as well as the varsity gym. A sailing center is also located close to the campus along the James river.

CNU sports club programs include ice hockey,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051025154345/http://clubs.users.cnu.edu/hockey/ CNU Ice Hockey - Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; equestrian, dressage, cycling, fishing, lacrosse, martial arts,&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/a/cnu.edu/cnumac/ ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; rock climbing, rugby, scuba diving, silver storm dance, soccer, swimming, table tennis, tennis, ultimate frisbee, rowing and volleyball.

==Campus==
[[File:CaptChristopherNewportStatue01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Statue of Sir Christopher Newport]]

===Boundaries===
[[File:CNU Campus.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Great Lawn of Christopher Newport University, featuring the David Student Union and the McMurran and Forbes academic buildings.]]
The traditional boundaries of the Christopher Newport University campus have been Warwick Boulevard, Shoe Lane, and Prince Drew Road in Newport News. In recent years, however, the university has "jumped" Warwick Boulevard, buying and demolishing properties in the immediate area to expand. The part of campus that is east of Warwick Boulevard is referred to as "East Campus" and is primarily used to house upper-class students.

===Residence halls===
Residence halls on campus are usually segregated into the class of student living in them. In the recent years, new policies have been enacted that require all freshman and sophomore students to live in an on campus housing facility, unless they live in the commuting zone. Starting with the class of 2014, all students must live on campus during the junior year in addition to their freshman and sophomore years.

;Freshman housing
The oldest housing facility on campus is Santoro Hall. Opened in 1992, the hall was named in honor of then President Anthony Santoro and his wife, Carol. This building is directly adjacent to one of the campus dining facilities, the Hiden-Hussey Commons. Santoro Hall, along with the newer York River Hall, is primarily used for freshman housing. York River Hall opened in 2002. This complex, consisting of two buildings (York River East/ York River West), houses over 500 students and is the largest residence hall on campus. Both Santoro and York River Halls are suite-style living residence halls. In each building, pairs of neighboring housing units share a common private restroom. Freshman also live in portions of Potomac River Hall.

;Upperclassmen housing
[[File:Potomac River Hall.jpg|thumb|left|300px|York River Hall]] Sophomore housing currently consists of James River Hall, opened in 2000, half of Potomac River Hall, opened in 2004, as well as Warwick River Hall, opened in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://housing.cnu.edu/residence.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109053147/http://housing.cnu.edu/residence.html%23 |date=November 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; James River Hall boasts a variety of floor plans, including 4, 5, and 6-person apartments, 4-person suites, and three 15-person Theme Units. Potomac Hall, like York River Hall, is divided into two buildings (North/ South), and consists of suites of two bedrooms, located around a central living room and bath. Warwick River Hall is the newest residence hall on campus and accommodates 447 students in 4, 5, and 6-person suites each with a shared living room and bathroom.

[[File:CNU Rappahanock Hall.gif|thumb|right|Rappahannock River Hall at Christopher Newport University]]Juniors and Seniors living on campus are generally assigned to either East Campus or Rappahannock River Hall. James River Hall also accommodates Juniors and Seniors in apartment style dorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cnu.edu/housing/residencehalls/|title=Residence Halls|website=cnu.edu|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNU is currently planning construction on a dedicated upperclassmen residence, to be called "Shenandoah Hall." It is expected to house more than 200 seniors and to open in summer 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Brett|title=New upperclassman housing to grace CNU’s campus|url=http://www.thecaptainslog.org/2017/news/new-upperclassman-housing-to-grace-cnus-campus/|website=The Captain's Log|publisher=Christopher Newport University|accessdate=19 October 2017|date=6 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906224649/http://www.thecaptainslog.org/2017/news/new-upperclassman-housing-to-grace-cnus-campus/|archive-date=2017-09-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2009, five sororities and four fraternities live in Barclay Apartments, CNU's temporary Greek Village, and any additional fraternities and sororities live in the adjacent townhouses of CNU Landing {{as of|2012|lc=y}}. Completed in 2002, CNU Apartments is a complex of five buildings of three or four stories, housing up to 355 students. These buildings, named after Virginia-born presidents, include Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Harrison, and Monroe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://housing.cnu.edu/apartments.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194451/http://housing.cnu.edu/apartments.html |date=July 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNU Village rose to accompany CNU Apartments in 2005, adding room for an additional 398 students in apartment living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://housing.cnu.edu/Villagefloorplans.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327173031/http://housing.cnu.edu/Villagefloorplans.html |date=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the apartments and the Village feature 2 to 4 single bedroom apartments with a common living area (full kitchen, living room/dinette, washer and dryer). Below CNU Village, along Warwick Blvd., are a variety of eating establishments including Panera Bread, Moe's Southwest Grill, Subway, 7-11, Sushi &amp; Spice, and Schooners, opened by three local restaurateurs who wanted to fill a void left by the lack of a social outlet on campus.

===Dining facilities===
The campus has two major dining facilities, Hiden-Hussey Commons and Regattas.

'''Hiden-Hussey Commons'''

The first dining facility on campus was originally named Harbour Lights. This all-you-can-eat cafeteria style facility is decorated internally with nautical memorabilia to go along with its name. In 2005 Harbour Lights was renamed to the Hiden-Hussey Commons. Newer students just refer to it as "The Commons." The dining hall was expanded in 2012 to include additional seating, serving lines, and a patio.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

'''Regattas'''

Regattas Restaurant is the newest dining hall on CNU's campus. Opened in 2002 inside the David Student Union, Regattas shares a similar format to the Hiden-Hussey Commons with the all-you-can-eat cafeteria style.  Regattas, however, sports a more up-tempo environment{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} and often features hand made waffle cones for ice cream and custom made omelettes.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} It is also home to CNU's Mongolian Grill&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cnu.edu/life/dining/dininghalls/|title=Dining Halls: Regatta's|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.   Regattas began an expansion in 2017 which was completed in Spring of 2018.

The David Student Union (DSU) is a $36 million, {{convert|116000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} facility whose construction began in 2003 and opened September 9, 2006. Constructed in a "Neo-[[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]" architectural style, the first floor contains the campus Convenience Store, parallel the DSU dining facilities: The Discovery Bistro, Discovery Cafe, [[Chick-fil-A]], Discovery [[Pizza]], and Regatta's. The campus Bookstore and Convenience Store closed during the Fall 2010 semester in favor of an online bookstore and instead contains a student lounge, admissions office, and apparel store. All on-campus students receive a mailbox and access to a full-service Post Office located on the second floor of the DSU. Four large conference rooms named for past U.S. Presidents are located around a central lobby area at the top of the steps. The Ballroom is also located on the second floor. The building provides offices for Student Life, The Captain's Log, Career Development, International Studies, Academic Advising, and others. Private desks with computers are provided for students as well as quiet study sections and recreational areas. The building was named in honor of William R. and Goldie R. David.

===Academic buildings===
For the opening of the Spring 2010 semester, Christopher Newport University opened the Lewis Archer McMurran, Jr. Hall. This building has neo-Georgian architecture. The building is 85,000 square feet and frames the university's Great Lawn on its western side. McMurran Hall houses the Departments of Modern and Classical Languages and Literatures, History, English, and Government. It has a 150-person lecture hall, two 50-person lecture halls, and over 25 other  classrooms.

To the north of McMurran Hall is Ratcliffe Hall, the former home of the Departments of English and Government. Once CNU's gymnasium, the building was renovated to include classroom and office space for students and faculty. Other academic buildings on campus include Gosnold Hall, Forbes Hall, and the Business and Technology Center (BTC Building), located across Prince Drew Lane. Finally, the [[Ferguson Center]] for the Arts is home to the Departments of Music and Theater &amp; Dance.

Wingfield Hall, the former home of the Departments of Psychology and Language, was demolished in 2011 to make way for the Joseph W. Luter Hall, home of the school of business.

The Joseph W. Luter, III Hall is the house of the Luter School of Business. The building, following the Neo-Georgian architecture of surrounding new structures, has a new 100-seat tiered lecture hall, 14 traditional classrooms, teachings labs, research labs and faculty offices.

The Mary Brock Forbes Integrated Science Building is a 156,000 sq ft academic hall situated on the north edge of the  great lawn, and houses the College of Natural and Behavioral Science as well as the Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science and Psychology departments. It also includes spaces for students to interact, 50 faculty offices, a large lecture hall, 50 classrooms, and research labs.

===The Paul and Rosemary Trible Library===

[[File:CNU Entrance.jpg|thumb|left|300px| The entrance to Christopher Newport University, featuring the York River Hall freshman residence hall, the Trible Library, and the Pope Chapel.]]
The university's library, renamed for Rosemary and [[Paul S. Trible, Jr.]], had a multimillion-dollar addition completed in early 2008. The new {{convert|110000|sqft|adj=on}} facility houses most of its collection in the original section. The new library was dedicated January 24, 2008, and fully opened at the start of the Spring 2008 semester. The Trible Library boasts a new Einstein's Cafe, a 24-hour study lounge, and an IT help desk.

In early 2009, the [[Mariners' Museum]] Library relocated to the Trible Library, providing students and the community with convenient access to the largest [[maritime history]] collection in the [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariner.org/library/about-library |title=About the Library |publisher=Mariners' Museum |date=1933-10-29 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paul and Rosemary Trible Library was slated for another expansion beginning in 2016 which would add another floor to the back portion of the facility. Due to the renovations, the Mariners' Museum Library moved back to the Mariners' Museum and reopened in Fall 2017.

In August of 2018, the library expansion opened adding 3 floors of new space.  Additions included a 100 seat theater, expanded Media Center, a two-story reading room, and 44 group study rooms.

===Ferguson Center for the Arts===
In 1996 the university acquired the [[Homer L. Ferguson High School|Ferguson High School]] building and property, which was adjacent to campus. This building was used for classrooms until it was extensively renovated to become the [[Ferguson Center for the Arts]], which opened in fall of 2005. Many features of the original high school, which was located between what is now the concert hall and the music and theatre hall, can still be seen throughout the current building. It houses a 1,725-seat concert hall which is acoustically engineered so that anyone on stage can be heard from any seat without a microphone, A 453-seat music and theatre hall, and a 200-seat studio theatre. It also contains two art galleries, a dance studio, and several classrooms.

===Pope Chapel===

Opened in early 2013, the Pope Chapel, named for Larry Pope of Smithfield Foods, is a 14,000 square foot gathering place for various on campus religious organizations located at the campus entrance across from York River Hall and the Trible Library.

===Christopher Newport Hall===
[[File:NewportHall May2015.jpg|alt=Christopher Newport Hall|left|thumb|250x250px|Christopher Newport Hall during the May 2015 commencement ceremony.]]
In the fall of 2015 a new administration building was opened and named Christopher Newport Hall. The 81,000 square foot structure houses the Office of Admission, Office of the Registrar, Financial Aid, Housing, the Center for Academic Success, the President's Leadership Program and the Center for Career Planning, among others. The $42 million facility serves as a new landmark on campus and is at the head of the Great Lawn opposite Lewis Archer McMurran, Jr. Hall. In May 2015, towards the end of construction, Newport Hall served as the backdrop for commencement ceremonies.

{{canon law}}
In the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the Catholic Church, '''the computation of time''',&lt;ref name=Peters39&gt;[[Edward N. Peters|Peters, Dr. Edward N.]], The 1917 or Pio-Benedictine Code of Canon Law, pg. 39 (Book I, Title III).&lt;/ref&gt; also translated as '''the reckoning of time'''&lt;ref name=Caparros160&gt;Caparros ''et al.'', ''[[1983 Code of Canon Law]]'', pg. 160 (Book I, Title XI: ''De temporis supputatione'')&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin:]] '''''supputatio temporis'''''&lt;ref name=Caparros160/&gt;), is the manner by which legally-specified periods of time are calculated according to the norm of the canons on the computation of time. The application of laws frequently involves a question of time: generally three months must elapse after their promulgation before they go into effect; some obligations have to be fulfilled within a certain number of days, or weeks, or months. Hence the need of the rules for the computation of time.&lt;ref name=Ayrinhac122&gt;Ayrinhac, ''General Legislation'' §122&lt;/ref&gt; With the Code of 1917 and the reformed [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Code of 1983]], the legislator has formulated these rules with a clearness and precision that they never had before.&lt;ref name=Ayrinhac122/&gt;
==Scope and nature of rules==
These rules hold in all canonical matters: universal ordinances, precepts, rescripts, privileges, judicial sentences; but they have nothing to do with problems of chronology or such questions as the determination of the date for the celebration of Easter.&lt;ref name=Ayrinhac122/&gt;

They are not absolute rules, but should be followed when no others have been expressly laid down; liturgical laws regarding, for example, the beginning of the ecclesiastical year, of the solemnity of a feast, remain unchanged.&lt;ref name=Ayrinhac122/&gt; The former use of 'time' in indulgences (prior to [[indulgentiarum doctrina|Paul VI's revision of sacred indulgences]]) had special provisions in the [[1917 Code of Canon Law|1917 Code]] (cc. 921, 922, 923, 931), and it is stated that in what pertains to the fulfilment or enforcement of [[contract (canon law)|contracts]], the prescriptions of the civil law should be complied with, unless there has been some other agreement to the contrary. Nothing prevents inferior legislators from adopting different rules for the application of their own laws, and it is clearly implied that private persons themselves have the same right in matters which depend on their will, like determining when an article sold should be delivered, paid for, etc.&lt;ref name=Ayrinhac122/&gt;

==Useful and continuous time==
By useful time is meant in law the time granted for the exercise or prosecution of one's rights in such a way that it does not run if one is prevented from using it through ignorance or some other cause.&lt;ref name=Ayrinhac129&gt;Ayrinhac, ''General Legislation'', §129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuous time suffers no delay or interruption from one's ignorance or impossibility to act.&lt;ref name=Ayrinhac129/&gt; 

Thus colleges which possess the right of appointment to a vacant office are given three months of useful time to exercise it, which implies  that if they were prevented, ''v.g.'' for ten days, from meeting for the election they would have that many additional days to exercise their right. On the contrary, capitular chapters have eight days after the vacancy of the episcopal see has been made known to them to elect a Vicar Capitular, and it is specified that if no election has been made within that time, whatever be the cause, that right devolves to the Metropolitan (cf. [[1917 Code of Canon Law|1917 CIC]] cc. 161, 432).&lt;ref name=Ayrinhac129/&gt;

==Months==
Months are computed according to the calendar from the date of publication.&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, Fernando. ''Manual of Canon Law'', pg. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; A "canonical month" (in contradistinction to a "calendar month") is a period of 30 days,&lt;ref&gt;Canon 202 §1, [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; while a "calendar month" is a continuous month. 
==''Vacatio legis''==
{{main|Vacatio legis}}
The ''[[vacatio legis]]'' is computed according to the calendar; for example, if a law is promulgated on 2 November, and the ''vacatio legis'' is 3 months, then the law takes effect on 2 February.&lt;ref&gt;De Meester, ''Juris Canonici Compendium'', v. 1, pg. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; So a universal law has a ''[[vacatio legis]]'' of approximately 90 days—3 months taken according to the calendar—while a particular law has a ''vacatio legis'' of approximately 30 days—1 month taken according to the calendar—unless specified to the contrary.
==History==
{{see also|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
From 1918&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]], [[apostolic constitution|ap. const.]] ''Providentissima Mater Ecclesia''&lt;/ref&gt; to 1983,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]], [[apostolic constitution|ap. const.]] ''[[Sacræ disciplinæ leges]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Book I, Title III of the ''[[1917 Code of Canon Law]]''&lt;ref name=Peters39/&gt; regulated the computation of time in the [[Latin Church]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13541">In [[database theory]], a '''conjunctive query''' is a restricted form of [[first-order logic|first-order]] queries using the [[logical conjunction]] operator. Many first-order queries can be written as conjunctive queries.  In particular, a large part of queries issued on [[relational database]]s can be expressed in this way.  Conjunctive queries also have a number of desirable theoretical properties that larger classes of queries (e.g., the [[relational algebra]] queries) do not share.

==Definition==
The conjunctive queries are simply the fragment of (domain independent) [[first-order logic]] given by the set of
formulae that can be constructed from [[atomic formula]]e using [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] &amp;and; and
[[existential quantification]] &amp;exist;, but not using [[disjunction]] &amp;or;, [[negation]] &amp;not;,
or [[universal quantification]] &amp;forall;.
Each such formula can be rewritten (efficiently) into an equivalent formula in [[prenex normal form]], thus this form is usually simply assumed.

Thus conjunctive queries are of the following general form:

:&lt;math&gt;(x_1, \ldots, x_k).\exists x_{k+1}, \ldots x_m. A_1 \wedge \ldots \wedge A_r&lt;/math&gt;,

with the [[Free variables and bound variables|free variables]] &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_k&lt;/math&gt; being called distinguished variables, and the [[Free variables and bound variables|bound variables]] &lt;math&gt;x_{k+1}, \ldots, x_m&lt;/math&gt; being called undistinguished variables. &lt;math&gt;A_1, \ldots, A_r&lt;/math&gt; are [[atomic formula]]e.

As an example of why the restriction to domain independent first-order logic is important,  consider &lt;math&gt;x_1.\exists x_2. R(x_2)&lt;/math&gt;, which is not domain independent; see [[Codd's theorem]].  This formula cannot be implemented in the select-project-join fragment of relational algebra, and hence should not be considered a conjunctive query.

Conjunctive queries can express a large part of queries, which are frequently issued on [[relational database]]s. To give an example, imagine a relational database for storing information about students, their address, the courses they take and their gender. Finding all male students and their addresses who attend a course that is also attended by a female student is expressed by the following conjunctive query:

 (student, address) . &amp;exist; (student2, course) .
    attends(student, course) &amp;and; gender(student, 'male') &amp;and; 
    attends(student2, course) &amp;and;
    gender(student2, 'female') &amp;and; lives(student, address)

Note that since the only entity of interest is the male student and his address, these are the only distinguished variables, while the variables &lt;code&gt;course&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;student2&lt;/code&gt; are only [[existential quantification|existentially quantified]], i.e. undistinguished.

== Fragments ==

Conjunctive queries without distinguished variables are called [[boolean conjunctive query|boolean conjunctive queries]]. Conjunctive queries where all variables are distinguished (and no variables are bound) are called '''equi-join queries''',&lt;ref&gt;Dan Olteanu, Jakub Závodný, ''Size Bounds for Factorised Representations of Query Results'', 2015, DOI 10.1145/2656335, [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/dan.olteanu/papers/oz-tods15.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; because they are the equivalent, in the [[relational calculus]], of the [[equi-join]] queries in the [[relational algebra]] (when selecting all columns of the result).

==Relationship to other query languages==
Conjunctive queries also correspond to select-project-join queries in [[relational algebra]] (i.e.,
relational algebra queries that do not use the operations union or difference) and to select-from-where queries in [[SQL]] in which the where-condition uses exclusively conjunctions of atomic equality conditions, i.e. conditions constructed from column names and constants using no comparison operators other than "=", combined using "and". Notably, this excludes the use of aggregation and subqueries. For example, the above query can be written as an SQL query of the conjunctive query fragment as

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="sql"&gt;
select l.student, l.address
from   attends a1, gender g1,
       attends a2, gender g2,
       lives l
where  a1.student = g1.student and
       a2.student = g2.student and
       l.student = g1.student and
       a1.course = a2.course and
       g1.gender = 'male' and
       g2.gender = 'female';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Datalog==
Besides their logical notation, conjunctive queries can also be written as [[Datalog]] rules. Many authors in fact prefer the following Datalog notation for the query above:
&lt;source lang="prolog"&gt;
 result(student, address) :- attends(student, course),  gender(student, male),
                             attends(student2, course), gender(student2, female),
                             lives(student, address).
&lt;/source&gt;
Although there are no quantifiers in this notation, variables appearing in the head of the rule are still implicitly [[universal quantification|universally quantified]], while variables only appearing in the body of the rule are still implicitly existentially quantified.

While any conjunctive query can be written as a Datalog rule, not every Datalog program can be written as a conjunctive query. In fact, only single rules over extensional predicate symbols can be easily rewritten as an equivalent conjunctive query. The problem of deciding whether for a given Datalog program there is an equivalent [[recursion|nonrecursive program]] (corresponding to a positive relational algebra query, or, equivalently, a formula of positive existential [[first-order logic]], or, as a special case, a conjunctive query) is known as the [[Datalog boundedness]] problem and is undecidable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerd G. Hillebrand]], [[Paris C. Kanellakis]], [[Harry G. Mairson]], [[Moshe Y. Vardi]]: Undecidable Boundedness Problems for Datalog Programs. J. Log. Program. 25(2): 163-190 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions==
Extensions of conjunctive queries capturing more [[expressive power (computer science)|expressive power]] include unions of conjunctive queries, which are equivalent to positive (i.e., [[negation]]-free) [[relational algebra]], conjunctive queries extended by union and [[negation]], which by [[Codd's theorem]] correspond to [[relational algebra]] and [[first-order logic]], conjunctive queries with built-in predicates and conjunctive queries with [[aggregate function]]s. The formal study of all of these extensions is justified by their application in [[relational databases]] and is in the realm of [[database theory]].

==Complexity==
For the study of the [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] of evaluating conjunctive queries, two problems have to be distinguished. The first is the problem of evaluating a conjunctive query on a [[relational database]] where both the query and the database are considered part of the input. The complexity of this problem is usually referred to as '''combined complexity''', while the complexity of the problem of evaluating a query on a relational database, where the query is assumed fixed, is
called '''data complexity'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Vardi | first=Moshe Y. | authorlink=Moshe Y. Vardi | title=The Complexity of Relational Query Languages (Extended Abstract) | year=1982 | pages=137–146 | url=http://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/papers/stoc82.pdf.gz | doi=10.1145/800070.802186| journal=Proceedings of [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjunctive queries are [[NP-complete]] with respect to combined complexity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ashok K. Chandra]] and [[Philip M. Merlin]], 1977. ''Optimal Implementation of Conjunctive Queries in Relational Data Bases''. STOC '77: Proceedings of the ninth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=803397&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM]&lt;/ref&gt; while the data complexity of conjunctive queries is very low, in the parallel complexity class [[AC0]], which is contained in [[LOGSPACE]] and thus in [[polynomial time]]. The [[NP-hard]]ness of conjunctive queries may appear surprising, since [[relational algebra]] and [[SQL]] strictly subsume the conjunctive queries and are thus at least as hard (in fact, relational algebra is [[PSPACE]]-complete with respect to combined complexity and is therefore even harder under widely held complexity-theoretic assumptions). However, in the usual application scenario, databases are large, while queries are very small, and the data complexity model may be appropriate for studying and describing their difficulty.

==Formal properties==
Conjunctive queries are one of the great success stories of [[database theory]] in that many interesting problems that are computationally hard or [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] for larger classes of queries are feasible for conjunctive queries.&lt;ref name="AHV"&gt;[[Serge Abiteboul]], [[Richard B. Hull]], [[Victor Vianu]]: Foundations of Databases. Addison-Wesley, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the query containment problem. We write &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq S&lt;/math&gt; for two [[database relation]]s &lt;math&gt;R, S&lt;/math&gt; of the same [[database schema|schema]] if and only if each tuple occurring in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; also occurs in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Given a query &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and a [[relational database]] instance &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, we write the result relation of evaluating the query on the instance simply as &lt;math&gt;Q(I)&lt;/math&gt;. Given two queries &lt;math&gt;Q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_2&lt;/math&gt; and a [[database schema]], the query containment problem is the problem of deciding whether for all possible database instances &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; over the input database schema, &lt;math&gt;Q_1(I) \subseteq Q_2(I)&lt;/math&gt;. The main application of query containment is in query optimization: Deciding whether two queries are equivalent is possible by simply checking mutual containment.

The query containment problem is undecidable for [[relational algebra]] and [[SQL]] but is decidable and [[NP-complete]] for conjunctive queries. In fact, it turns out that the query containment problem for conjunctive queries is exactly the same problem as the query evaluation problem.&lt;ref name="AHV"/&gt; Since queries tend to be small, [[NP-completeness]] here is usually considered acceptable.  The query containment problem for conjunctive queries is also equivalent to the [[constraint satisfaction problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

An important class of conjunctive queries that have polynomial-time combined complexity are the '''acyclic''' conjunctive queries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mihalis Yannakakis]]: Algorithms for Acyclic Database Schemes . Proc. VLDB 1981: 82-94.&lt;/ref&gt; The query evaluation, and thus query containment, is [[LOGCFL]]-complete and thus in [[polynomial time]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Gottlob]], [[Nicola Leone]], and [[Francesco Scarcello]] (2001). "The complexity of acyclic conjunctive queries". Journal of the ACM 48 (3): 431–498. {{doi|10.1145/382780.382783}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Acyclicity of conjunctive queries is a structural property of queries that is defined with respect to the query's [[hypergraph]]:&lt;ref name="AHV"/&gt; a conjunctive query is acyclic if and only if it has hypertree-width 1. For the special case of conjunctive queries in which all relations used are binary, this notion corresponds to the treewidth of the [[dependency graph]] of the variables in the query (i.e., the graph having the variables of the query as nodes and an undirected edge &lt;math&gt;\{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt; between two variables if and only if there is an atomic formula &lt;math&gt;R(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;R(y,x)&lt;/math&gt; in the query) and the conjunctive query is acyclic if and only if its dependency graph is [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|acyclic]].

An important generalization of acyclicity is the notion of [[hypertree decomposition|bounded hypertree-width]], which is a measure of how close to acyclic a hypergraph is, analogous to bounded [[treewidth]] in [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]]. Conjunctive queries of bounded tree-width have [[LOGCFL]] combined complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Gottlob]], [[Nicola Leone]], and [[Francesco Scarcello]]: Hypertree Decompositions and Tractable Queries. J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 64(3): 579-627 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Unrestricted conjunctive queries over tree data (i.e., a relational database consisting of a binary child relation of a tree as well as unary relations for labeling the tree nodes) have polynomial time combined complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Gottlob]], [[Christoph Koch]], [[Klaus U. Schulz]]: Conjunctive queries over trees. J. ACM 53(2): 238-272 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Party politics}}

The '''conservation movement''', also known as '''nature conservation''', is a political, environmental, and social movement that seeks to protect [[natural resource]]s including animal and plant species as well as their habitat for the future.

The early conservation movement included [[fisheries]] and wildlife management, water, [[soil]] conservation, and [[sustainable forestry]]. The contemporary conservation movement has broadened from the early movement's emphasis on use of sustainable yield of natural resources and preservation of [[wilderness]] areas to include preservation of [[biodiversity]]. Some say the conservation movement is part of the broader and more far-reaching [[environmental movement]], while others argue that they differ both in ideology and practice. Chiefly in the United States, conservation is seen as differing from [[environmentalism]] in that it aims to preserve natural resources expressly for their continued [[sustainable]] use by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Early history===
[[File:Sylva paper 1662.jpg|right|thumb| ''Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber in His Majesty's Dominions,'' title page of the first edition (1664).]]
The conservation movement can be traced back to [[John Evelyn]]'s work ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber|Sylva]]'', presented as a paper to the [[Royal Society]] in 1662. Published as a book two years later, it was one of the most highly influential texts on [[forestry]] ever published.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Evelyn]], ''Sylva, Or A Discourse of Forest Trees ... with an Essay on the Life and Works of the Author by John Nisbet'', Fourth Edition (1706), reprinted London: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1908, V1, p. lxv; online edn, March 2007 [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20778/20778-h/20778-h.htm], accessed 29 Dec 2012. This source (John Nisbet) states: "There can be no doubt that John Evelyn, both during his own lifetime and throughout the two centuries which have elapsed since his death in 1706, has exerted more individual influence, through his charming ''Sylva'', ... than can be ascribed to any other individual." Nisbet adds that "Evelyn was by no means the first [author] who wrote on [forestry]. That honour belongs to Master [[Anthony Fitzherbert|Fitzherbert]], whose ''Boke of Husbandrie'' was published in 1534" (V1, p. lxvi).&lt;/ref&gt; Timber resources in England were becoming dangerously depleted at the time, and Evelyn advocated the importance of conserving the forests by managing the rate of depletion and ensuring that the cut down trees get replenished.

The field developed during the 18th century, especially in [[Prussia]] and France where scientific forestry methods were developed. These methods were first applied rigorously in [[British India]] from the early-19th century. The government was interested in the use of [[forest produce]] and began managing the forests with measures to reduce the risk of wildfire in order to protect the "household" of nature, as it was then termed. This early ecological idea was in order to preserve the growth of delicate [[teak]] trees, which was an important resource for the [[Royal Navy]]. Concerns over teak depletion were raised as early as 1799 and 1805 when the Navy was undergoing a massive expansion during the [[Napoleonic War]]s; this pressure led to the first formal conservation Act, which prohibited the felling of small teak trees. The first forestry officer was appointed in 1806 to regulate and preserve the trees necessary for shipbuilding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edugreen.teri.res.in/explore/forestry/history.htm|title=History of forests in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; This promising start received a setback in the 1820s and 30s, when [[laissez-faire]] economics and complaints from private landowners brought these early conservation attempts to an end.

===Origins of the modern conservation movement===
Conservation was revived in the mid-19th century, with the first practical application of scientific conservation principles to the forests of India. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in [[British India]] through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, E.P (1922)''The forests of India'' vol. 1, pp. 72-81&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Percy Stebbing]] warned of desertification of India. The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barton |first=Greg |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WDYlNljAP5AC|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|isbn=9781139434607 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These local attempts gradually received more attention by the British government as the unregulated felling of trees continued unabated. In 1850, the [[British Association]] in Edinburgh formed a committee to study forest destruction at the behest of [[Hugh Francis Cleghorn|Dr. Hugh Cleghorn]] a pioneer in the nascent conservation movement.

He had become interested in [[Sustainable forest management|forest conservation]] in [[Mysore]] in 1847 and gave several lectures at the Association on the failure of agriculture in India. These lectures influenced the government under [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] to introduce the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the [[United States]]. In the same year, Cleghorn organised the [[Tamil Nadu Forest Department|Madras Forest Department]] and in 1860 the Department banned the use [[shifting cultivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=Nov 5, 2007|work=Metro Plus Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleghorn's 1861 manual, ''The forests and gardens of South India'', became the definitive work on the subject and was widely used by forest assistants in the subcontinent.&lt;ref name="Cleghorn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

[[File:Sir William Schlich07.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Schlich, in the middle of the seated row, with students from the forestry school at Oxford, on a visit to the forests of Saxony in the year 1892.]]
Sir [[Dietrich Brandis]], a [[Germany|German]] forester, joined the British service in 1856 as superintendent of the teak forests of Pegu division in eastern [[Myanmar|Burma]]. During that time Burma's [[teak]] forests were controlled by militant [[Karen people|Karen]] tribals. He introduced the "taungya" system,&lt;ref&gt;King KFS (1968). "Agro-silviculture (the taungya system)". University of Ibadan / Dept. of Forestry, Bulletin no. 1, 109&lt;/ref&gt; in which Karen villagers provided labour for clearing, planting and weeding teak plantations. After seven years in Burma, Brandis was appointed Inspector General of Forests in India, a position he served in for 20 years. He formulated new forest legislation and helped establish research and training institutions. The [[Imperial Forest School]] at [[Dehradun]] was founded by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weil|first1=Benjamin|title=Conservation, Exploitation, and Cultural Change in the Indian Forest Service, 1875-1927|journal=Environmental History|date=1 April 2006|volume=11|issue=2|pages=319–343|doi=10.1093/envhis/11.2.319|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233861694_Conservation_Exploitation_and_Cultural_Change_in_the_Indian_Forest_Service_1875-1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madhav Gadgil and Ramachandra Guha, ''This Fissured Land: An Ecological History of India'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Germans were prominent in the forestry administration of British India. As well as Brandis, [[Berthold Ribbentrop]] and [[Sir William P.D. Schlich]] brought new methods to Indian conservation, the latter becoming the Inspector-General in 1883 after Brandis stepped down. Schlich helped to establish the journal ''[[Indian Forester]]'' in 1874, and became the founding director of the first [[forestry]] school in England at [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Cooper's Hill]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Burley, Jeffery, et al. 2009. "A History of Forestry at Oxford", ''British Scholar'', Vol. 1, No. 2., pp.236-261. Accessed: May 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He authored the five-volume ''Manual of Forestry'' (1889–96) on [[silviculture]], [[forest management]], [[forest protection]], and [[forest utilisation]], which became the standard and enduring textbook for forestry students.

{{Main|Conservation in the United States}}
The American movement received its inspiration from 19th century works that exalted the inherent value of nature, quite apart from human usage. Author [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817-1862) made key philosophical contributions that exalted nature. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book ''[[Walden]],'' which argued that people should become intimately close with nature. The ideas of [[Dietrich Brandis|Sir Brandis]], [[Sir William P.D. Schlich]] and [[Carl A. Schenck]] were also very influential - [[Gifford Pinchot]], the first chief of the [[USDA Forest Service]], relied heavily upon Brandis' advice for introducing professional forest management in the U.S. and on how to structure the Forest Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaticsociety.org.bd/journals/Golden_jubilee_vol/articles/H_468%20(Brett%20M%20Benet).htm America has been the context for both the origins of conservation history and its modern form, environmental history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313144333/http://www.asiaticsociety.org.bd/journals/Golden_jubilee_vol/articles/H_468%20%28Brett%20M%20Benet%29.htm |date=2012-03-13 }}.

Both conservationists and preservationists appeared in political debates during the [[Progressive Era]] (the 1890s&amp;mdash;early 1920s). There were three main positions. The laissez-faire position held that owners of private property—including lumber and mining companies, should be allowed to do anything they wished for their property.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Hays, ''Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement, 1890-1920'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservationists, led by future President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his close ally [[George Bird Grinnell]], were motivated by the wanton waste that was taking place at the hand of market forces, including logging and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Redekop, "Embodying the Story: The Conservation Leadership of Theodore Roosevelt" in ''Leadership'' (2015).  DOI: 10.1177/1742715014546875.  [http://cnu.edu/leadershipstudies/faculty/pdf/redekop-embodying_the_story_theodore_roosevelts_conservation_leadership.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114045519/http://cnu.edu/leadershipstudies/faculty/pdf/redekop-embodying_the_story_theodore_roosevelts_conservation_leadership.pdf |date=2016-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice resulted in placing a large number of North American game species on the edge of extinction. Roosevelt recognized that the laissez-faire approach of the U.S. Government was too wasteful and inefficient. In any case, they noted, most of the natural resources in the western states were already owned by the federal government.  The best course of action, they argued, was a long-term plan devised by national experts to maximize the long-term economic benefits of natural resources. To accomplish the mission, Roosevelt and Grinnell formed the [[Boone and Crockett Club]] in 1887. The Club was made up of the best minds and influential men of the day. The [[Boone and Crockett Club]]'s contingency of conservationists, scientists, politicians, and intellectuals became Roosevelt's closest advisers during his march to preserve wildlife and habitat across North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives of the Boone and Crockett Club|url=http://cdm16013.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16013coll13/id/1220/rec/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Preservationists, led by [[John Muir]] (1838–1914), argued that the conservation policies were not strong enough to protect the interest of the natural world because they continued to focus on the natural world as a source of economic production.

The debate between conservation and preservation reached its peak in the public debates over the construction of California's [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (California)|Hetch Hetchy dam]] in [[Yosemite National Park]] which supplies the water supply of San Francisco. Muir, leading the [[Sierra Club]], declared that the valley must be preserved for the sake of its beauty: "No holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man."

President [[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] put conservationist issue high on the national agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas G. Brinkley, ''The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter, [[Gifford Pinchot]] and was deeply committed to conserving natural resources. He encouraged the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres (360,000&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 930,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more federal land for [[national park]]s and [[nature preserve]]s than all of his predecessors combined.&lt;ref&gt;W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservations Legacy'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:TR-Enviro.JPG|Thumb|250px|right|Roosevelt was a leader in conservation, fighting to end the waste of natural resources]]

Roosevelt established the [[United States Forest Service]], signed into law the creation of five [[National parks (United States)|national parks]], and signed the year 1906 [[Antiquities Act]], under which he proclaimed 18 new [[National Monument (United States)|national monuments]]. He also established the first 51 [[bird reserve]]s, four [[game preserve]]s, and 150 [[United States National Forest|national forests]], including [[Shoshone National Forest]], the nation's first. The area of the United States that he placed under public protection totals approximately {{convert|230000000|acre|km2}}.

[[Gifford Pinchot]] had been appointed by McKinley as chief of Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture. In 1905, his department gained control of the national forest reserves.  Pinchot promoted private use (for a fee) under federal supervision. In 1907, Roosevelt designated 16 million acres (65,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of new national forests just minutes before a deadline.&lt;ref&gt;Char Miller, ''Seeking the Greatest Good: The Conservation Legacy of Gifford Pinchot'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the [[Conference of Governors]] held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: "Conservation as a National Duty.".

In 1903 Roosevelt toured the Yosemite Valley with [[John Muir]], who had a very different view of conservation, and tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests.

Theodore Roosevelt's view on conservationism remained dominant for decades; - [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] authorised the building of many large-scale dams and water projects, as well as the expansion of the National Forest System to buy out sub-marginal farms.  In 1937, the [[Pittman–Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act]] was signed into law, providing funding for state agencies to carry out their conservation efforts.

====Since 1970====
Environmental reemerged on the national agenda in 1970, with Republican [[Richard Nixon]] playing a major role, especially with his creation of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. The debates over the public lands and environmental politics played a supporting role in the decline of liberalism and the rise of modern environmentalism. Although Americans consistently rank environmental issues as "important", polling data indicates that in the voting booth voters rank the environmental issues low relative to other political concerns.

The growth of the Republican party's political power in the inland West (apart from the Pacific coast) was facilitated by the rise of popular opposition to public lands reform.  Successful Democrats in the inland West and Alaska typically take more conservative positions on environmental issues than Democrats from the Coastal states.  Conservatives drew on new organizational networks of think tanks, industry groups, and citizen-oriented organizations, and they began to deploy new strategies that affirmed the rights of individuals to their property, protection of extraction rights, to hunt and recreate, and to pursue happiness unencumbered by the federal government at the expense of resource conservation.&lt;ref&gt;* Turner, James Morton, "The Specter of Environmentalism": Wilderness, Environmental Politics, and the Evolution of the New Right.

=== Conservation in Costa Rica ===
[[File:Areas Conservacion CR.svg|thumb|Figure 1. Costa Rica divided into different areas of conservation]]

Although the conservation movement developed in Europe in the 18th century, [[Costa Rica]] as a country has been heralded its champion in the current times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/25/costa-rica-biodiversity|title=Costa Rica recognised for biodiversity protection|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=2010-10-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa Rica hosts an astonishing number of species, given its size, having more animal and plant species than the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]] combined&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; while being only 250 miles long and 150 miles wide. A widely accepted theory for the origin of this unusual density of species is the free mixing of species from both North and South America occurring on this "inter-oceanic" and "inter-continental" landscape.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Preserving the natural environment of this fragile landscape, therefore, has drawn the attention of many international scholars.

Costa Rica has made conservation a national priority, and has been at the forefront of preserving its natural environment with over a quarter of its land designated as protected in some form, which is under the administrative control of [[National System of Conservation Areas|SINAC]] (National System of Conservation Areas) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inbio.ac.cr/es/biod/estrategia/estudio.html|title=http://www.inbio.ac.cr/es/biod/estrategia/estudio.html|website=inbio.ac.cr|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a division of [[Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications|MINAE]] (Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications). SINAC has subdivided the country into various zones depending on the ecological diversity of that region - these zones are depicted in figure 1.

The country has used this ecological diversity to its economic advantage in the form of a thriving [[Ecotourism in Costa Rica|ecotourism industry]], putting its commitment to nature, on display to visitors from across the globe. It is estimated that a record 2.6 million foreigners visited the country in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/01/16/costa-rica-welcomes-2-6-million-tourists-2015-hits-new-record|title=Costa Rica tourism sets new record with 2.6 million visitors in 2015|work=The Tico Times Costa Rica|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost half the population of Costa Rica itself. This tourism is facilitated by the fact that Costa Rica has a stable democracy and has a [[human development index]] of 0.776, the highest for any country in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/CRI|title={{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the only country in the world that generates more than 99% of its electricity from renewable sources, relying on hydropower (78%), wind (10%), geothermal energy (10%), biomass and solar (1%). Critics have pointed out however, that in achieving this milestone, the country has built several dams (providing the bulk of its electricity) some of which have negatively impacted indigenous communities as well as the local flora and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/costa-rica-electricity-renewable-energy-300-days-2017-record-wind-hydro-solar-water-a8069111.html|title=Costa Rica runs entirely on renewable energy for 300 days this year|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Historical development ====
[[File:16th century Spanish expansion in the Caribbean.png|thumb|Figure 2. 16th century Spanish expansion in the Caribbean]]
"The Green Republic: A Conservation History of Costa Rica" by Sterling Evans is a renowned book that traces the development of the conservation movement in Costa Rica from the mid 1700s to present day.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=NckTGXhHZgQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=The+Green+Republic:+A+Conservation+History+of+Costa+Rica,&amp;ots=83nGtAQb-k&amp;sig=sg06Dd_009atdW-IjCOB_in1xM4#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Green%20Republic:%20A%20Conservation%20History%20of%20Costa%20Rica,&amp;f=false|title=The Green Republic: A Conservation History of Costa Rica|last=Evans|first=Sterling|date=2010-06-28|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292789289|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans mentions that when the Spaniards first arrived in the Americas, the landscape of Costa Rica did not appear particularly hospitable to them, compared to Guatemala or Mexico which seemed more reminiscent of the Spanish climate. Therefore, up until the 18th century, there was very little agricultural development in the region. It also lacked gold and other minerals that [[Christopher Columbus]] had hoped to find in these areas (hence the name, Rich Coast). As a result, the forest cover of Costa Rica was left more or less intact by the European settlement in the Americas.

By the mid-19th century, it was observed that the Costa Rican soil was particularly conducive to the growth of coffee. The global demand for coffee was growing rapidly, fueled by the demand from the working class in the industrializing west. The agricultural model adopted by coffee growers in Costa Rica was of small family owned farms known as ''cafeteras,'' and they strove to be responsible stewards of the land. This approach was in stark contrast to the coffee [[monoculture]] that would've developed by adopting a purely capitalistic ideology. As a result, even though the coffee production increased substantially from 1850 to 1950, there wasn't large scale deforestation in Costa Rica until the 1950s, contrary to popular belief.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Some of the key points often overlooked in Costa Rica's conservation history between 1850 and 2000 according to Evans, are as follows:

1. President Bernardo Soto's government in 1888 began the process of attracting scholars from all over the world, particularly Switzerland and Germany in an effort to educate the locals about agricultural practices harmonious with the environment such that by 1914, Costa Rica became a leading scientific research center in tropical America

2. The establishment of the [[University of Costa Rica]] (UCR) in the 1940s was a landmark event, since the university acted as a springboard for research into tropical studies in Central America. At the helm of UCR were many influential academics such as [[Rafael Lucas Rodríguez]] and [[Alexander Skutch]] whose forward thinking publications served as a foundation for the future policy decisions. Skutch noted,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

"&lt;small&gt;in the mid-1930s, Costa Rica was still largely unspoiled. Its population of less than a half a million people . . .was concentrated in the narrow Meseta Central. . . . Other advantages . . . to the naturalist were its political stability and the friendliness of its people. . . . Costa Rica has a record of continuous, orderly constitutional government that scarcely any other country in Latin America can match. Thus the naturalist working in some remote spot was not likely to have his studies suddenly interrupted or his thin lines of communication cut by a violent upheaval, as has happened to many in Latin America. .&lt;/small&gt;"

3. By 1950, Costa Rica became heavily reliant on coffee exports to Europe and the US. Around the same time, it was battling the dilemma between increasing agricultural output on one hand and protecting natural resources for future use on the other. In 1958, however, the world coffee prices plummeted, and Costa Rica's main source of income was shown to be very vulnerable to unpredictable forces. The government responded by promoting internal manufacturing and encouraging other industries. One such industry that emerged as a result, was the meat industry.

The Central American valley has been described as "perfect for cattle" by [[Carl Hoffman]]. Until 1970, the cattle raised in Costa Rica were primarily used for domestic consumption. Around 1970, the demand for beef from the US started showing an exponential growth due to the rise of the fast-food industry. This robust demand, coupled with the falling coffee prices gave the cattle industry a boost and forests started getting replaced with pastures. At its worst, Costa Rica was losing 4% of its forested area per year.

An alternative analysis by Julia Flagg within the framework of "[[Process tracing|process-tracing]]" reveals that after gaining independence in 1821 the isolation of Costa Rica from El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua was critical in shaping its future and served as a divergence point in the evolution of the Central American nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flagg|first=Julia A.|date=2018-01-24|title=Carbon Neutral by 2021: The Past and Present of Costa Rica’s Unusual Political Tradition|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/2/296|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=296|doi=10.3390/su10020296}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mahoney &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511750328|title=Colonialism and Postcolonial Development|last=Mahoney|first=James|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511750328|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; “ . . . while all of the other provinces quickly became engulfed in warfare and political chaos, Costa Rica escaped such devastation and made tentative economic strides forward”. She also argues that the lack of a land-owning elite class in Costa Rica was instrumental in the development of good governance and  maintaining a stable democracy in the country. The abolishing of the military in 1948 helped free up valuable resources that the government chose to invest into education and resource protection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The country entered into a positive reinforcement cycle thereafter, where new laws enacted drew international praise which helped solidify Costa Rica's position as global leader in resource protection .

==== Examples of active efforts ====

===== Environmental Services Program =====
To counter reducing forest area coverage in the 1980's, the Costa Rican government pioneered a [[Payment for ecosystem services#Costa Rica|scheme]] in 1997 known as ''PES'', which rewarded private land owners for keeping forests intact on their lands in lieu of the services provided by these forests to the environment and the economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iied.org/payments-for-ecosystem-services-costa-rica-s-recipe|title=Payments for ecosystem services: Costa Rica’s recipe|date=2013-11-29|work=International Institute for Environment and Development|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank, which provided the loan initially from 2000 to 2006 to support the payments incentivizing afforestation, viewed the program as a success overall despite some of its shortcomings.

It is estimated that the percentage of Costa Rican land covered by forests has gone up from around 20% in the 1980's to over 50% of the total area in 2013 - a growth of 250%. The program has also reduced the national carbon emissions by 11 million tons over a period of 6 years from 1999 to 2005. Indigenous communities and women in particular, have benefited due to this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2015/12/16/costa-rica-improves-the-efficiency-of-its-payment-for-environmental-services-program|title=Costa Rica Improves the Efficiency of its Payment for Environmental Services Program|work=World Bank|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buoyed by this success, the World Bank extended its support to the Costa Rican government's initiative by funding a new program titled "Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projects.worldbank.org/P093384/mainstreaming-market-based-instruments-environmental-management-project?lang=en|title=Projects  : Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management Project {{!}} The World Bank|website=projects.worldbank.org|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, many international agencies have pushed the national government to make the process of obtaining the payments easier so as to include more underdeveloped communities and cast a wider net for the program.

===== Green sea turtle conservation =====
[[File:Green sea turtle (1).jpg|thumb|A Green sea turtle]]
The [[green sea turtle]] is a globally endangered species and one of the most important nesting grounds for it is in [[Tortuguero National Park|Tortuguero]], Costa Rica&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-01-01|title=Long-term conservation efforts contribute to positive green turtle Chelonia mydas nesting trend at Tortuguero, Costa Rica|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320704001715|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=121|issue=1|pages=111–116|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.04.014|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the word Totuguero is derived from old Spanish maps meaning "place of turtles". After a steady global decline in its population due to overhunting for its meat and eggs, the Tortuguero National Park was established in 1975 in an effort to protect and save the turtle's breeding zone. A highly cited study&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; by Tröeng and Rankin, investigated in 2004, the effects that this protective measure has had on the nesting trend. Although the population of turtles shows a large inter-annual variation thus making the task of determining the exact number very difficult, on an average, the trend has been positive over a long time scale of almost 35 years. The study illustrated that the enactment of three laws by the Costa Rican government was vital in stabilizing and increasing the population of these green sea turtles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

1. A ban on turtle and egg collection in 1963

2. A ban on the export of [[calipee]] (a part of the turtle's head that is considered a delicacy) in 1970 and finally,

3. The creation of the Tortuguero National Park in 1975 by the legislative assembly.

The lasting impact created by such forward thinking political decisions exhibits the necessity of meaningful governmental intervention.

===== Carbon neutral goal =====
[[File:EARTH-La Flor Campus Classroom.jpg|thumb|Classroom of [[EARTH University|Earth University]] in Costa Rica - a carbon neutral university]]
Although they contribute only 0.15% to the world's [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]], the governments of New Zealand and Costa Rica&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5439|title=Costa Rica and New Zealand on Path to Carbon Neutrality {{!}} Worldwatch Institute|website=worldwatch.org|language=cust-en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; have independently expressed their intents to become carbon neutral in the next decade, with Costa Rica aiming to achieve an ambitious target of becoming carbon neutral by 2021.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thecostaricanews.com/costa-rica-promotes-carbon-neutral-program-2021/|title=Costa Rica Promotes the Carbon Neutral Program in 2021 {{!}} The Costa Rica News|last=Villegas|first=Charito|date=2017-11-14|work=The Costa Rica News|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, it would become the world's first carbon neutral country, with the expectation of influencing policy decisions in other major countries. The proposal hopes to ignite the interest of private companies to engage in practices that reduce their emissions, for example, using more fuel efficient routes in transportation, relying more on digital documents than printed ones, adopting LED lighting in offices and using more efficient air conditioning systems.

==== Criticisms of active efforts ====
The government's approach to attain zero net emissions has yielded positive results overall, but has been described as insufficient and lacking by experts &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; because it neglects vehicular emissions which account for nearly 20% of the country's total emissions. The 2021 target has also been called "arbitrary" and "overambitious", since the efforts to reduce the country's reliance on imported oil &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thecostaricanews.com/costa-rica-carbon-neutral-2021-reality-or-unrealistic/|title=Costa Rica Carbon Neutral 2021: Reality or Unrealistic?|last=STAFF|first=TCRN|date=2014-07-21|work=The Costa Rica News|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; will take much longer to take effect.

In 2006, a study by Sierra and Russman&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-08-05|title=On the efficiency of environmental service payments: A forest conservation assessment in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800905004982|journal=Ecological Economics|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=131–141|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.10.010|issn=0921-8009}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the additional conservation obtained through PES, over and above the baseline conservation rate. The study concluded that the PES program definitely affected land use decisions because land owners used the payments for other productive activities thus keeping the forest cover intact. However, they also concluded that this was not the most effective use of funds because the majority of these forests would have remained intact even without the payments. The study suggested that it would a better strategy to engage in the protection of more critical habitats instead.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;    
[[File:Represa Hidroeléctrica Reventazón, Costa Rica (1).jpg|thumb|The Reventazón Dam has come under criticism recently for the loss of habitat it has caused for many species]]

Protestors of this project claim that the construction has failed to meet the expectations on the following issues:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

1) The constructors did not completely clear vegetation from the areas that would be flooded due to this project. As a result, the uncleared vegetation in the flooded areas began to stagnate, creating the perfect conditions for the growth of the [[Eichhornia crassipes|Water Hyacinth]] (an invasive species). The Water Hyacinth acted as a source for a large amount of carbon dioxide and methane emitted into the atmosphere.

2) Reforestation around the reservoir lake to assist in the migration of the jaguars has not been completed making their movement more difficult.

3) Due to the removal of a lot of material to facilitate construction, the neighboring Lancaster wetlands (home to more than 250 species of birds and 80 species of mammals, reptiles and amphibians) have been left in a state more susceptible to landslides.

What appears to be common in these criticisms is that the initiatives have moved things in the right direction overall, but the implementation hasn't been as good as promised.

== Areas of concern ==
[[Deforestation]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] are issues affecting all regions of the world.  The consequent destruction of wildlife habitat has prompted the creation of conservation groups in other countries, some founded by local hunters who have witnessed declining wildlife populations first hand.  Also, it was highly important for the conservation movement to solve problems of living conditions in the cities and the overpopulation of such places.

=== Boreal forest and the Arctic ===
The idea of incentive conservation is a modern one but its practice has clearly defended some of the sub Arctic wildernesses and the wildlife in those regions for thousands of years, especially by indigenous peoples such as the Evenk, Yakut, Sami, Inuit and Cree. The fur trade and hunting by these peoples have preserved these regions for thousands of years. Ironically, the pressure now upon them comes from non-renewable resources such as oil, sometimes to make synthetic clothing which is advocated as a humane substitute for fur. (See [[Raccoon dog]] for case study of the conservation of an animal through fur trade.) Similarly, in the case of the beaver, hunting and fur trade were thought to bring about the animal's demise, when in fact they were an integral part of its conservation. For many years children's books stated and still do, that the decline in the beaver population was due to the fur trade. In reality however, the decline in beaver numbers was because of habitat destruction and deforestation, as well as its continued persecution as a pest (it causes flooding). In Cree lands however, where the population valued the animal for meat and fur, it continued to thrive. The Inuit defend their relationship with the seal in response to outside critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icc.gl/UserFiles/File/sealskin/2006-03-07_icc_saelskind_pressemeddelse_eng.pdf|title=Inuit Ask Europeans to Support Its Seal Hunt and Way of Life|date=6 March 2006|accessdate=12 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628204105/http://www.icc.gl/UserFiles/File/sealskin/2006-03-07_icc_saelskind_pressemeddelse_eng.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin America (Bolivia) ===
The [[Izoceño people|Izoceño]]-[[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]], [[Bolivia]] is a tribe of hunters who were influential in establishing the Capitania del Alto y Bajo Isoso (CABI). CABI promotes economic growth and survival of the Izoceno people while discouraging the rapid destruction of habitat within Bolivia's [[Gran Chaco]]. They are responsible for the creation of the 34,000 square kilometre Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Area (KINP).  The KINP protects the most biodiverse portion of the Gran Chaco, an ecoregion shared with Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. In 1996, the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] joined forces with CABI to institute wildlife and hunting monitoring programs in 23 Izoceño communities. The partnership combines traditional beliefs and local knowledge with the political and administrative tools needed to effectively manage habitats. The programs rely solely on voluntary participation by local hunters who perform self-monitoring techniques and keep records of their hunts.  The information obtained by the hunters participating in the program has provided CABI with important data required to make educated decisions about the use of the land. Hunters have been willing participants in this program because of pride in their traditional activities, encouragement by their communities and expectations of benefits to the area.

=== Africa (Botswana) ===
In order to discourage illegal South African hunting parties and ensure future local use and sustainability, indigenous hunters in [[Botswana]] began lobbying for and implementing conservation practices in the 1960s. The Fauna Preservation Society of Ngamiland (FPS) was formed in 1962 by the husband and wife team: Robert Kay and June Kay, environmentalists working in conjunction with the Batawana tribes to preserve wildlife habitat.

The FPS promotes habitat conservation and provides local education for preservation of wildlife. Conservation initiatives were met with strong opposition from the Botswana government because of the monies tied to big-game hunting. In 1963, BaTawanga Chiefs and tribal hunter/adventurers in conjunction with the FPS founded [[Moremi Wildlife Reserve|Moremi National Park and Wildlife Refuge]], the first area to be set aside by tribal people rather than governmental forces. Moremi National Park is home to a variety of wildlife, including lions, giraffes, elephants, buffalo, zebra, cheetahs and antelope, and covers an area of 3,000 square kilometers.  Most of the groups involved with establishing this protected land were involved with hunting and were motivated by their personal observations of declining wildlife and habitat.

'''Copy number variation'''  ('''CNV''') is a phenomenon in which sections of the genome are repeated and the number of repeats in the genome varies between individuals in the human population.&lt;ref name="Mccaroll and altshuler"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mccarroll|first1=S.

R.|last3=Merico|first3=D.|last4=Scherer|first4=S.

Copy number variations can be generally categorized into two main groups: short repeats and long repeats. However, there are no clear boundaries between the two groups and the classification depends on the nature of the [[locus (genetics)|loci]] of interest. Short repeats include mainly [[Tandem repeat|bi-nucleotide]] repeats (two repeating nucleotides e.g. A-C-A-C-A-C...) and tri-nucleotide repeats. Long repeats include repeats of entire genes. This classification based on size of the repeat is the most obvious type of classification as size is an important factor in examining the types of mechanisms that most likely gave rise to the repeats,&lt;ref name="hastings"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hastings|first1=P. J.|last2=Lupski|first2=J. R.|last3=Roseberg|first3=S. M.|last4=Ira|first4=G.|title=Mechanisms of change in gene copy number|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=2009|volume=10|pages=551–564|doi=10.1038/nrg2593|pmid=19597530|pmc=2864001}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence the likely effects of these repeats on phenotype.

==Types and chromosomal rearrangements==
One of the most well known examples of a short copy number variation is the tri-nucleotide repeat of the CAG base pairs in the [[Huntingtin|Huntingtin gene]], the gene that is responsible for the neurological disorder [[Huntington's disease]].&lt;ref name="macdonald et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macdonald|first1=M.|last2=Ambrose|first2=C. M.|last3=Duyao|first3=M. P.|last4=Myers|first4=R. H.|last5=Lin|first5=C.|last6=Srinidhi|first6=L.|last7=Barnes|first7=G.|last8=Taylor|first8=S. A.|last9=James|first9=M.|last10=Groot|first10=N.|title=A novel gene containing a trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on Huntington's disease chromosomes|journal=Cell|date=1993|volume=72|issue=6|pages=971–983|pmid=8458085|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(93)90585-e|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/30901/3/0000570.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this particular case, once the CAG tri-nucleotide repeats more than 36 times, Huntington’s disease will likely develop in the individual and it will likely be inherited by his or her offspring.&lt;ref name="macdonald et al"/&gt; The number of repeats of the CAG tri-nucleotide is correlated with the [[age of onset]] of Huntington’s disease.&lt;ref name=myer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myer|first1=R. H.|title=Huntington’s Disease Genetics|journal=NeuroRx|date=2004|volume=1|issue=2|pages=255–262|doi=10.1602/neurorx.1.2.255|pmid=15717026|pmc=534940}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of short repeats are often thought to be due to errors in [[polymerase]] activity during [[DNA replication|replication]] including polymerase slippage, template switching, and fork switching which will be discussed in detail later. The short repeat size of these copy number variations lends itself to errors in the polymerase as these repeated regions are prone to misrecognition by the polymerase and replicated regions may be replicated again, leading to extra copies of the repeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albertini|first1=A. M.|last2=Hofer|first2=M.|last3=Calos|first3=M. P.|last4=Miller|first4=J. H.|title=On the formation of spontaneous deletions: The importance of short sequence homologies in the generation of large deletions|journal=Cell|date=1982|volume=29|issue=2|pages=319–328|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(82)90148-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if these tri-nucleotide repeats are in the same [[reading frame]] in the [[Coding region|coding]] portion of a gene, it may lead to a long chain of the same [[amino acid]], possibly creating [[Protein aggregation|protein aggregates]] in the cell,&lt;ref name=myer/&gt; and if these short repeats fall into the non-coding portion of the gene, it may affect [[gene expression]] and regulation. On the other hand, a variable number of repeats of entire genes is less commonly identified in the genome. One example of a whole gene repeat is the [[alpha-amylase]] 1 gene (AMY1) that encodes alpha-amylase which has a significant copy number variation between different populations with different diets.&lt;ref name="perry"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perry|first1=G. H.|last2=Dominy|first2=N. J.|last3=Claw|first3=K. G.|last4=Lee|first4=A. S.|last5=Fiegler|first5=H.|last6=Redon|first6=R.|last7=Werner|first7=J.|last8=Villanae|first8=F. A.|last9=Mountain|first9=J. L.|last10=Misra|first10=R|title=Diet and the evolution of human amylase gene copy number variation|journal=Nature Genetics|date=2007|volume=39|issue=10|pages=1256–1260|doi=10.1038/ng2123|pmid=17828263|pmc=2377015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the specific mechanism that allows the AMY1 gene to increase or decrease its copy number is still a topic of debate, some hypotheses suggest that the [[non-homologous end joining]] or the [[microhomology-mediated end joining]] is likely responsible for these whole gene repeats.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; Repeats of entire genes has immediate effects on expression of that particular gene, and the fact that the copy number variation of the AMY1 gene has been related to diet is a remarkable example of recent human evolutionary adaptation.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; Although these are the general groups that copy number variations are grouped into, the exact number of base pairs copy number variations affect depends on the specific loci of interest. Currently, using data from all reported copy number variations, the mean size of copy number variant is around 118kb, and the median is around 18kb.&lt;ref name=freeman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=J. L.|title=Copy number variation: New insights in genome diversity|journal=Genome Research|date=2006|volume=16|pages=949–961|doi=10.1101/gr.3677206|pmid=16809666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the structural architecture of copy number variations, research has suggested and defined hotspot regions in the genome where copy number variations are four times more enriched.&lt;ref name="Sharp et al"/&gt; These hotspot regions were defined to be regions containing long repeats that are 90–100% similar known as [[segmental duplication]]s either [[tandem]] or interspersed and most importantly, these hotspot regions have an increased rate of [[chromosomal rearrangement]].&lt;ref name="Sharp et al"/&gt; It was thought that these large-scale chromosomal rearrangements give rise to normal [[Genetic variation|variation]] and [[genetic diseases]], including copy number variations.&lt;ref name="Mccaroll and altshuler"/&gt; Moreover, these copy number variation hotspots are consistent throughout many populations from different continents, implying that these hotspots were either independently acquired by all the populations and passed on through generations, or they were acquired in early human evolution before the populations split, the latter seems more likely.&lt;ref name="Mccaroll and altshuler"/&gt; Lastly, spatial biases of the location at which copy number variations are most densely distributed does not seem to occur in the genome.&lt;ref name="Mccaroll and altshuler"/&gt; Although it was originally detected by [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]] and [[Microsatellite|microsatellite analysis]] that copy number repeats are localized to regions that are highly repetitive such as [[telomere]]s, [[centromere]]s, and [[heterochromatin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bailey|first1=J. A.|last2=Gu|first2=Z.|last3=Clark|first3=R. A.|last4=Reinert|first4=K.|last5=Samonte|first5=R. V.|last6=Schwartz|first6=S.|last7=Adams|first7=M. D.|last8=Myers|first8=E. W.|last9=Li|first9=P. W.|last10=Eichler|first10=E. E.|title=Recent Segmental Duplications in the Human Genome|journal=Science|date=2002|volume=297|issue=5583|pages=1003–1007|doi=10.1126/science.1072047}}&lt;/ref&gt; recent [[Genome-wide association study|genome-wide studies]] have concluded otherwise.&lt;ref name="Sharp et al"/&gt; Namely, the [[subtelomeric]] regions and pericentromeric regions are where most chromosomal rearrangement hotspots are found, and there is no considerable increase in copy number variations in that region.&lt;ref name="Sharp et al"/&gt; Furthermore, these regions of chromosomal rearrangement hotspots do not have decreased gene numbers, again, implying that there is minimal spatial bias of the genomic location of copy number variations.&lt;ref name="Sharp et al"/&gt;

==Detection and identification==
Copy number variation was initially thought to occupy an extremely small and negligible portion of the genome through [[cytogenetic]] observations.&lt;ref name=jacobs&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=P. A.|last2=Browne|first2=C.|last3=Gregson|first3=N.|last4=Joyce|first4=C.|last5=White|first5=H.|title=Estimates of the frequency of chromosome abnormalities detectable in unselected newborns using moderate levels of banding|journal=Journal of Medical Genetics|date=1992|volume=29|issue=2|pages=103–108|doi=10.1136/jmg.29.2.103|pmid=1613759|pmc=1015848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copy number variations were generally associated only with small tandem repeats or specific genetic disorders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inuoe|first1=K|last2=Lupski|first2=J. R.|title=Molecular mechanism for genetic disorders|journal=Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics|date=2002|volume=3|pages=199–242|doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.3.032802.120023}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, copy number variations were initially only examined in terms of specific loci. However, breakthroughs in the past decade or so led to an increasing number of highly accurate ways of identifying and studying copy number variations, one of which is the genome-wide association study that allow copy number variations in general to be located and identified in the genome. Copy number variations were originally studied by cytogenetic techniques, which are techniques that allow one to observe the physical structure of the chromosome.&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt; One of these techniques is [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]] (FISH) which involves inserting fluorescent probes that require a high degree of [[Complementation (genetics)|complementarity]] in the genome for binding.&lt;ref name=freeman/&gt; [[Comparative genomic hybridization]] was also commonly used to detect copy number variations by [[fluorophore]] visualization and then comparing the length of the chromosomes.&lt;ref name=freeman/&gt; One major drawback of these early techniques is that the genomic resolution is relatively low and only large repeats such as whole gene repeats can be detected.

Recent advances in [[biotechnology]] gave rise to many important techniques that are of extremely high genomic resolution and as a result, an increasing number of copy number variations in the genome have been reported.&lt;ref name=freeman/&gt; One of these advances involves using [[bacterial artificial chromosome]] (BAC) array with around 1 megabase of intervals throughout the entire gene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iafrate|first1=A. J.|last2=Feuk|first2=L.|last3=Rivera|first3=M. N.|last4=Listewnik|first4=M. L.|last5=Donahoe|first5=P. K.|last6=Qi|first6=Y.|last7=Scherer|first7=S. W.|last8=Lee|first8=C.|title=Detection of large-scale variation in the human genome|journal=Nature Genetics|date=2004|volume=36|issue=9|pages=949–951|pmid=15286789|doi=10.1038/ng1416}}&lt;/ref&gt; BACs can also detect copy number variations in rearrangement hotspots allowing for the detection of 119 novel copy number variations.&lt;ref name="Sharp et al"/&gt; Throughout the past decade or so, [[Genomic sequencing|high throughput genomic sequencing]] has revolutionized the field of human genomics and [[in silico]] studies have been performed to detect copy number variations in the genome.&lt;ref name="Sharp et al"/&gt; Reference sequences have been compared to other sequences of interest using [[fosmid]]s by strictly controlling the fosmid clones to be 40kb.&lt;ref name=tuzun&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tuzun|first1=E.|last2=Sharp|first2=A. J.|last3=Bailey|first3=J. A.|last4=Kaul|first4=R.|last5=Morrison|first5=V. A.|last6=Pertz|first6=L. M.|last7=Haugen|first7=E.|last8=Hayden|first8=H.|last9=Albertson|first9=D.|last10=Pinkel|first10=D.|title=Fine-scale structural variation of the human genome|journal=Nature Genetics|date=2005|volume=37|issue=7|pages=727–732|pmid=15895083|doi=10.1038/ng1562}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequencing end reads would provide adequate information to align the reference sequence to the sequence of interest, and any misalignments are easily noticeable thus concluded to be copy number variations within that region of the clone.&lt;ref name=tuzun/&gt; This type of detection technique offers a high genomic resolution and precise location of the repeat in the genome, and it can also detect other types of structural variation such as inversions.&lt;ref name=freeman/&gt;
In addition, another way of detecting copy number variation that can ensure high genomic resolution is using [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNP).&lt;ref name=freeman/&gt; Since the [[International HapMap Project|International HapMap project]] had begun, common SNPs that occur between four different populations from different continents have been sequenced and located. Due to the abundance of the human SNP data, the direction of detecting copy number variation has changed to utilize these SNPs.&lt;ref name=conrad&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conrad|first1=D. F.|last2=Antonarakis|first2=S. E.|title=Gene Duplication: A Drive for Phenotypic Diversity and Cause of Human Disease. Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics|journal=Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics|date=2007|volume=8|pages=17–35|pmid=17386002|doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.8.021307.110233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relying on the fact that human [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] is relatively rare and that many recombination events occur in specific regions of the genome known as recombination hotspots, [[linkage disequilibrium]] can be used to identify copy number variations.&lt;ref name=conrad/&gt; Efforts have been made in associating copy number variations with specific [[haplotype]] SNPs by analyzing the linkage disequilibrium, using these associations, one is able to recognize copy number variations in the genome using SNPs as markers.&lt;ref name=conrad/&gt; One drawback of this method is that because SNPs in the International HapMap are not optimized for detecting copy number variations, therefore the data is biased towards large copy number variations.&lt;ref name=freeman/&gt; [[DNA sequencing|Next-generation sequencing]] has also been used recently to detect copy number variations with high genomic resolutions. Using [[Shotgun sequencing|whole-genome shot-gun sequencing]] data, assays have been developed to accurately detect and identify regions of duplications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xie|first1=C|last2=Tammi|first2=M. T.|title=CNV-seq, a new method to detect copy number variation using high-throughput sequencing|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=2009|volume=10|issue=8|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-10-80|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is very challenging to detect CNVs in targeted sequencing because it is extremely unlikely that breakpoints will occur inside the scant number of regions captured by a gene panel. Thus, soft-clipped reads and discordant reads are unlikely to be found in targeted sequencing. On average, there is about 1 SNP per 800 bit/s, so over a long enough region, B-allele frequencies (BAF) can be used to detect copy number changes. However, in targeted sequencing, there are not enough heterozygous variants within a short region to detect deviations from the expected 50% BAF. Lastly, high resolution microarrays that have copy number probes as well as SNP probes are the gold standard for detecting copy number changes down to 50 kbs with whole genome coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biocompare.com/Editorial-Articles/139157-Detecting-Copy-Number-Variation-at-High-Resolution/|title=Detecting Copy-Number Variation at High Resolution|author=|date=|website=www.biocompare.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Accurately detecting, identifying, and categorizing copy number variations is extremely important because of the complications they bring to DNA sequencing. Traditionally, DNA sequencing relied heavily on sequencing short reads from a large genome and using any overlapping regions of the reads to combine the short reads to form longer reads. This will eventually be mapped together to give the sequence of the entire genome. However, the issues related to copy number variations arise in linking the overlapping regions together. By definition, copy number variation is a region of the genome duplicated a variable number of times in the population and due to the large variation between the number of times portions of the genome are duplicated, when mapping overlapping sequences, it becomes unclear whether or not a region is an overlap or a duplicated region. With all the challenges faced by sequencing to detect copy number variations, high resolution microarrays are the technology of choice.

==Molecular mechanism==
There are two main types of molecular mechanism for the formation of copy number variations: [[homology (biology)|homologous]] based and non-homologous based.&lt;ref name="hastings"/&gt; Although many suggestions have been put forward, most of these theories are speculations and conjecture. There is no conclusive evidence that correlates a specific copy number variation to a specific mechanism.
[[File:Non allelic homologous recombination.png|thumb|''Diagrammatic representation of non-allelic homologous recombination. Here, Gene X represents the gene of interest and the black line represents the chromosome. When the two homologous chromosomes are misaligned and recombination occurs, it may result in a duplication of the gene.'']]
One of the best-recognized theories that leads to copy number variations as well as [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]] and inversions is [[non-allelic homologous recombination]]s.&lt;ref name=pagues&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pagues|first1=F|last2=Haber|first2=J. E.|title=Multiple pathways of recombination induced by double-strand breaks in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae|journal=Microbiological Reviews|date=1999|volume=63|issue=2|pages=349–404|pmid=10357855|pmc=98970}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[meiotic recombination]], homologous chromosomes pair up and form two ended double-stranded breaks leading to [[Holliday junctions]]. However, in the aberrant mechanism, during the formation of Holliday junctions, the double-stranded breaks are misaligned and the [[chromosomal crossover|crossover]] lands in non-allelic positions on the same chromosome. When the Holliday junction is resolved, the unequal crossing over event allows transfer of genetic material between the two homologous chromosomes, and as a result, a portion of the DNA on both the homologues is repeated.&lt;ref name=pagues/&gt; Since the repeated regions are no longer [[Independent segregation|segregating independently]], the duplicated region of the chromosome is inherited. Another type of homologous recombination based mechanism that can lead to copy number variation is known as break induced replication.&lt;ref name=bauters&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauters|first1=M.|last2=Esch|first2=H. V.|last3=Friez|first3=M. J.|last4=Boespflug-Tanguy|first4=O.|last5=Zenker|first5=M.|last6=Vianna-Morgante|first6=A. M.|last7=Rosenberg|first7=C.|last8=Ignatius|first8=J.|last9=Raynaud|first9=M.|last10=Hollanders|first10=K.|title=Nonrecurrent MECP2 duplications mediated by genomic architecture-driven DNA breaks and break-induced replication repair|journal=Genome Research|date=2008|volume=18|issue=6|pages=847–858|doi=10.1101/gr.075903.107|pmid=18385275|pmc=2413152}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a double stranded break occurs in the genome unexpectedly the cell activates pathways that mediate the repair of the break.&lt;ref name=bauters/&gt; Errors in repairing the break, similar to non-allelic homologous recombination, can lead to an increase in copy number of a particular region of the genome. During the repair of a double stranded break, the broken end can invade its homologous chromosome instead of rejoin the original strand.&lt;ref name=bauters/&gt; As in the non-allelic homologous recombination mechanism, an extra copy of a particular region is transferred to another chromosome, leading to a duplication event. Furthermore, [[cohesin]] proteins are found to aid in the repair system of double stranded breaks through clamping the two ends in close proximity which prevents interchromosomal invasion of the ends.&lt;ref name=kobayashi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kobayashi|first1=T.|last2=Ganley|first2=A. R.|title=Recombination Regulation by Transcription-Induced Cohesin Dissociation in rDNA Repeats|journal=Science|date=2005|volume=309|issue=5740|pages=1581–1584|doi=10.1126/science.1116102|pmid=16141077}}&lt;/ref&gt; If for any reason, such as activation of [[ribosomal RNA]], cohesin activity is affected then there may be local increase in double stranded break repair errors.&lt;ref name=kobayashi/&gt;

The other class of possible mechanisms that are hypothesized to lead to copy number variations is non-homologous based. To distinguish between this and homologous based mechanisms, one must understand the concept of homology. Homologous pairing of chromosomes involved using DNA strands that are highly similar to each other (~97%) and these strands must be longer than a certain length to avoid short but highly similar pairings.&lt;ref name="hastings"/&gt; Non-homologous pairings, on the other hand, rely on only few base pairs of similarity between two strands, therefore it is possible for genetic materials to be exchanged or duplicated in the process of non-homologous based double stranded repairs.&lt;ref name="hastings"/&gt;

One type of non-homologous based mechanism is the non-homologous end joining or [[Microhomology-mediated end joining|micro-homology end joining]] mechanism.&lt;ref name=leiber&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leiber|first1=M.R.|title=The Mechanism of Human Nonhomologous DNA End Joining|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=2007|volume=283|issue=1|pages=1–5|pmid=17999957|doi=10.1074/jbc.R700039200}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanisms are also involved in repairing double stranded breaks but require no homology or limited micro-homology.&lt;ref name="hastings"/&gt; When these strands are repaired, oftentimes there are small deletions or insertions added into the repaired strand. It is possible that [[retrotransposons]] are inserted into the genome through this repair system.&lt;ref name=leiber/&gt; If retrotransposons are inserted into a non-allelic position on the chromosome, meiotic recombination can drive the insertion to be recombined into the same strand as an already existing copy of the same region. Another mechanism is the break-fusion-bridge cycle which involves [[sister chromatids]] that have both lost its telomeric region due to double stranded breaks.&lt;ref name=mcclintock&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McClintock|first1=B.|title=Chromosome Organization And Genic Expression|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology|date=1951|volume=16|pages=13–47|pmid=14942727|doi=10.1101/sqb.1951.016.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that these sister chromatids will fuse together to form one [[dicentric chromosome]], and then segregate into two different nuclei.&lt;ref name=mcclintock/&gt; Because pulling the dicentric chromosome apart causes a double stranded break, the end regions can fuse to other double stranded breaks and repeat the cycle.&lt;ref name=mcclintock/&gt; The fusion of two sister chromatids can cause inverted duplication and when these events are repeated throughout the cycle, the inverted region will be repeated leading to an increase in copy number.&lt;ref name=mcclintock/&gt; The last mechanism that can lead to copy number variations is polymerase slippage, which is also known as template switching.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=C. E.|last2=Llorente|first2=B.|last3=Symington|first3=L. S.|title=Template switching during break-induced replication|journal=Nature|date=2007|volume=447|pages=102–105|doi=10.1038/nature05723}}&lt;/ref&gt; During normal DNA replication, the polymerase on the [[lagging strand]] is required to unclamp and re-clamp the replication region continuously.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; When small scale repeats in the DNA sequence exist already, the polymerase can be ‘confused’ when it re-clamps to continue replication and instead of clamping to the correct base pairs, it may shift a few base pairs and replicate a portion of the repeated region again.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Note that although this has been experimentally observed and is a widely accepted mechanism, the molecular interactions that led to this error remains unknown. In addition, because this type of mechanism requires the polymerase to jump around the DNA strand and it is unlikely that the polymerase can re-clamp at another locus some kilobases apart, therefore this is more applicable to short repeats such as bi-nucleotide or tri-nucleotide repeats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bi|first1=S.|last2=Liu|first2=L.

==Alpha-amylase gene==
[[File:Hominin Diet Timeline.jpg|thumb|''Timeline of the change in hominin diet throughout late Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods. As seen, root vegetables rich in starch are consumed around 20,000 years ago when the AMY1 diploid gene number was estimate to increase.'']]
Amylase is an [[enzyme]] in saliva that is responsible for the breakdown of [[starch]] into [[monosaccharides]], and one type of amylase is encoded by the alpha-amylase gene (AMY1).&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; The AMY1 locus, as well as the amylase enzyme, is one of the most extensively studied and sequenced gene in the human genome. Its homologs are also found in other primates and therefore it is likely that the [[primate]] AMY1 gene is ancestral to the human AMY1 gene and was adapted early in primate evolution.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; AMY1 is one of the most well studied genes which has wide range of variable numbers of copies throughout different human populations.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; The AMY1 gene is also one of the few genes that had been studied that displayed convincing evidence which correlates its protein function to its copy number.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; Copy number is known to alter [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] as well as [[translation]] levels of a particular gene, however research has shown that the relationship between protein levels and copy number is variable.&lt;ref name=korbel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korbel|first1=J. O.|last2=Kim|first2=P. M.|last3=Chen|first3=X.|last4=Urban|first4=A. E.|last5=Weissman|first5=S.|last6=Snyder|first6=M.|last7=Gerstein|first7=M. B.|title=The current excitement about copy-number variation: how it relates to gene duplications and protein families|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|date=2008|volume=18|issue=3|pages=366–374|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2008.02.005|pmid=18511261|pmc=2577873}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the AMY1 genes of European Americans it is found that the concentration of salivary amylase is closely correlated to the copy number of the AMY1 gene.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; As a result, it was hypothesized that the copy number of the AMY1 gene is closely correlated with its protein function, which is to digest starch.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt;

The AMY1 gene copy number has been found to be correlated to different levels of starch in diets of different populations.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; 8 Populations from different continents were categorized into high starch diets and low starch diets and their AMY1 gene copy number was visualized using high resolution FISH and [[qPCR]].&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; It was found that the high starch diet populations which consists of the Japanese, Hadza, and European American populations had a significantly higher (2 times higher) average AMY1 copy number than the low starch diet populations including Biaka, Mbuti, Datog, Yakut populations.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; It was hypothesized that the levels of starch in one’s regular diet, the substrate for AMY1, can directly affect the copy number of the AMY1 gene.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; Since it was concluded that the copy number of AMY1 is directly correlated with salivary amylase,&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; the more starch present in the population’s daily diet, the more evolutionarily favorable it is to have multiple copies of the AMY1 gene. The AMY1 gene was the first gene to provide strong evidence for evolution on a [[molecular genetics]] level.&lt;ref name=korbel/&gt; Moreover, using [[comparative genomic hybridization]], copy number variations of the entire genomes of the Japanese population was compared to that of the Yakut population.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; It was found that the copy number variation of the AMY1 gene was significantly different from the copy number variation in other genes or regions of the genome, suggesting that the AMY1 gene was under a strong selective pressure that had little or no influence on the other copy number variations.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; Finally, the variability of length of 783 [[microsatellite]]s between the two populations were compared to copy number variability of the AMY1 gene. It was found that the AMY1 gene copy number range was larger than that of over 97% of the microsatellites examined.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; This implies that [[natural selection]] played a considerable role in shaping the average number of AMY1 genes in these two populations.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; However, as only 6 populations were studied, it is important to consider the possibility that there may be other factors in their diet or culture that influenced the AMY1 copy number other than starch.
[[File:Amy1 gene in apes.png|thumb|''Simplified phylogenetic tree of the great ape lineage and the number of diploid AMY1 gene that each species has. AMY1 gene number shown to increase after split with the chimpanzee lineage.'']]
Although it is unclear when the AMY1 gene copy number began to increase, it is known and confirmed that the AMY1 gene existed in early primates. [[Chimpanzee]]s, the closest evolutionary relatives to humans, were found to have 2 [[Ploidy|diploid]] copies of the AMY1 gene that is identical in length to the human AMY1 gene,&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; which is significantly less than that of humans. On the other hand, [[bonobo]]s, also a close relative of modern humans, was found to have more than 2 diploid copies of the AMY1 gene.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; Nonetheless, the bonobo AMY1 genes were sequenced and analyzed, and it was found that the coding sequences of the AMY1 genes were disrupting, which may lead to the production of dysfunctional salivary amylase.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; It can be inferred from the results that the increase in bonobo AMY1 copy number is likely not correlated to the amount of starch in their diet. It was further hypothesized that the increase in copy number began recently during early [[hominin]] evolution as none of the [[great apes]] had more than two copies of the AMY1 gene that produced functional protein.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; In addition, it was speculated that the increase in the AMY1 copy number began around 20,000 years ago when humans shifted from a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to [[Agriculture|agricultural]] societies, which was also when humans relied heavily on [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]] high in starch.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; This hypothesis, although logical, lacks experimental evidence due to the difficulties in gathering information on the shift of human diets, especially on root vegetables that are high in starch as they cannot be directly observed or tested. Recent breakthroughs in DNA sequencing has allowed researchers to sequence older DNA such as that of [[Neanderthal]]s to a certain degree of accuracy. Perhaps sequencing Neanderthal DNA can provide a time marker as to when the AMY1 gene copy number increased and offer insight into human diet and gene evolution.

Currently it is unknown which mechanism gave rise to the initial duplication of the amylase gene, and it can imply that the insertion of the [[retroviral]] sequences was due to non-homologous end joining, which caused the duplication of the AMY1 gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samuelson|first1=L. C.|last2=Wiebauer|first2=L.|last3=Snow|first3=C. M.|last4=Meisler|first4=M. H.|title=Retroviral and pseudogene insertion sites reveal the lineage of human salivary and pancreatic amylase genes from a single gene during primate evolution|journal=Molecular and Cell Biology|date=1990|volume=10|issue=6|pages=2513–2520|pmid=1692956|doi=10.1128/mcb.10.6.2513|pmc=360608}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is currently no evidence to support this theory and therefore this hypothesis remains conjecture. The recent origin of the multi-copy AMY1 gene implies that depending on the environment, the AMY1 gene copy number can increase and decrease very rapidly relative to genes that do not interact as directly with the environment.&lt;ref name=korbel/&gt; The AMY1 gene is an excellent example of how [[gene dosage]] affects the survival of an organism in a given environment. The multiple copies of the AMY1 gene gives those who rely more heavily on high starch diets an evolutionary advantage, therefore the high gene copy number persists in the population.&lt;ref name=korbel/&gt;

==Gene families, and natural selection==
[[File:Gene families.png|thumb|''Possible mechanism of how multiple copies of a gene can lead to a protein family over years with natural selection. Here, Gene X is the gene of interest that is duplicated and Gene X1 and Gene X2 are genes that acquired mutations and became functionally different to Gene X.'']]
Recently, there had been discussion connecting copy number variations to [[gene families]]. Gene families are defined as a set of related genes that serve similar functions but have minor temporal or spatial differences and these genes likely derived from one [[Ancestor|ancestral]] gene.&lt;ref name=korbel/&gt; The main reason copy number variations are connected to gene families is that there is a possibility that genes in a family may have derived from one ancestral gene which got duplicated into different copies.&lt;ref name=korbel/&gt; Mutations accumulate through time in the genes and with [[natural selection]] acting on the genes, some mutations lead to environmental advantages allowing those genes to be inherited and eventually clear gene families are separated out. An example of a gene family that may have been created due to copy number variations is the [[globin]] gene family. The globin gene family is an elaborate network of genes consisting of [[Hemoglobin, alpha 1|alpha]] and [[HBB|beta]] globin genes including genes that are expressed in both embryos and adults as well as [[pseudogenes]].&lt;ref name=goodman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodman|first1=M.|last2=Koop|first2=B. F.|last3=Czelnusniak|first3=J.|last4=Weiss|first4=M. L.|title=The n-globin gene: Its long evolutionary history in the B-globin gene family of mammals|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=1984|volume=180|issue=4|pages=803–823|pmid=6527390|doi=10.1016/0022-2836(84)90258-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These globin genes in the globin family are all well conserved and only differ by a small portion of the gene, indicating that they were derived from a common ancestral gene, perhaps due to duplication of the initial globin gene.&lt;ref name=goodman/&gt;

Research has shown that copy number variations are significantly more common in genes that encode proteins that directly interact with the environment than proteins that are involved in basic cellular activities.&lt;ref name=redon&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redon|first1=R.|last2=Ishikawa|first2=S.|last3=Fitch|first3=K. R.|last4=Feuk|first4=L.|last5=Perry|first5=G. H.|last6=Andrew|first6=T. D.|last7=Fiegler|first7=H.|last8=Shapero|first8=M. H.|last9=Carson|first9=A. R.|last10=Chen|first10=W.|title=Global variation in copy number in the human genome|journal=Nature|date=2006|volume=444|pages=444–454|doi=10.1038/nature05329|pmid=17122850|pmc=2669898}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that the gene dosage effect accompanying copy number variation may lead to detrimental effects if essential cellular functions are disrupted, therefore proteins involved in cellular pathways are subjected to strong [[purifying selection]].&lt;ref name=redon/&gt; In addition, proteins function together and interact with proteins of other pathways, therefore it is important to view the effects of natural selection on bio-molecular pathways rather than on individual proteins. With that being said, it was found that proteins in the periphery of the pathway are enriched in copy number variations whereas proteins in the center of the pathways are depleted in copy number variations.&lt;ref name=kim&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=P. M.|last2=Korbel|first2=J. O.|last3=Gerstein|first3=M. B.|title=Positive selection at the protein network periphery: Evaluation in terms of structural constraints and cellular context|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2007|volume=104|issue=51|pages=20274–20279|doi=10.1073/pnas.0710183104|pmid=18077332|pmc=2154421}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was explained that proteins in the periphery of the pathway interact with fewer proteins and so a change in protein dosage affected by a change in copy number may have a smaller effect on the overall outcome of the cellular pathway.&lt;ref name=kim/&gt;

In the past few years, researchers seem to have shifted their focus from detecting, locating, and sequencing copy number variations to in depth analyses of the role of these copy number variations in the human genome and in nature in general. Evidence is needed to further validate the relationship between copy number variations and gene families as well as the role that natural selection plays in shaping these relationships and changes. Furthermore, researchers are also aiming to elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in copy number variations as it may reveal essential information regarding structural variations in general. Taking a step back, the area of structural variation in the human genome seems to be a rapidly growing research topic. Not only can these research data provide additional evidence for evolution and natural selection, it can also be used to develop treatments for a wide range of genetic diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4219">'''Croatian National Corpus''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatski nacionalni korpus}}, ''HNK'') is the biggest and the most important corpus of the [[Croatian language]]. Its compilation started in 1998 at the Institute of Linguistics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffzg.hr/zzl Institute of Linguistics]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]], [[University of Zagreb]] following the ideas of  [http://hnk.ffzg.hr/mt Marko Tadić]. The theoretical foundations and the expression of the need for a general-purpose, representative and multi-million corpus of the Croatian language started to appear even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Tadić 1990, [http://www.hnk.ffzg.hr/txts/mt4hnk.pdf 1996], [http://www.hnk.ffzg.hr/txts/mt4hnk2.pdf 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian National Corpus is compiled from selected texts written in Croatian covering all fields, topics, genres and styles: from literary and scientific texts to text-books, newspaper, user-groups and chat rooms.

The initial composition was divided in two constituents:
# ''30-million corpus of contemporary Croatian language'' (30m) where samples from texts from 1990 on were included. The criteria for inclusion of text samples were: written by native speakers, different fields, genres and topics. Translated text or poetry were excluded.
# ''Croatian Electronic Text Archive'' (HETA) where the complete text were included, particularly serial publications (volumes, series, editions etc.) which would imbalance the 30m if they were inserted there.

In [[ecology]], a '''disturbance''' is a temporary change in environmental conditions that causes a pronounced change in an [[ecosystem]]. Disturbances often act quickly and with great effect, to alter the physical structure or arrangement of biotic and [[abiotic]] elements. Disturbance can also occur over a long period of time and can impact the [[biodiversity]] within an ecosystem. Major ecological disturbances may include [[fires]], [[flooding]], [[windstorm]]s, [[insect]] [[outbreaks]] and [[trampling]]. [[Earthquake]]s, various [[types of volcanic eruptions]], [[tsunami]], [[firestorm]]s, [[impact events]], [[climate change]], and the devastating effects of [[human impact on the environment]] ([[anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] disturbances) such as [[clearcutting]], [[deforestation|forest clearing]] and the introduction of [[invasive species]]&lt;ref name="bioscience"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dale, V.|author2=Joyce, L.|author3=McNulty, S.|author4=Neilson, R.|author5=Ayres, M.|author6=Flannigan, M.|author7=Hanson, P.|author8=Irland, L.|author9=Lugo, A.|author10=Peterson, C.|author11=Simberloff, D.|author12=Swanson, F.|author13=Stocks, B.|author14=Wotton, B.|date=September 2001|title=Climate Change and Forest Disturbances|journal=[[BioScience]]|volume=51|issue=9|pages=723–734|doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0723:CCAFD]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be considered major disturbances. Not only invasive species can have a profound effect on an ecosystem, but also naturally occurring species can cause disturbance by their behavior.  Disturbance forces can have profound immediate effects on ecosystems and can, accordingly, greatly alter the [[biocoenosis|natural community]]. Because of these and the impacts on populations, disturbance determines the future shifts in dominance, various species successively becoming dominant as their life history characteristics, and associated life-forms, are exhibited over time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Use of Vital Attributes to Predict Successional Changes in Plant Communities Subject to Recurrent Disturbances|last=Nobel|first=I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==

Conditions under which natural disturbances occur are influenced mainly by [[climate]], weather, and location.&lt;ref name="bioscience" /&gt;Natural fire disturbances for example occur more often in areas with a higher incidence of lightning and flammable biomass, such as [[Longleaf pine ecosystem|longleaf pine ecosystems]] in the southeastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1035947633|title=Fire ecology of Florida and the southeastern coastal plain|last=F.,|first=Noss, Reed|isbn=9780813052199|location=Gainesville|oclc=1035947633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions often occur as part of a cycle and disturbances may be periodic. Other disturbances, such as those caused by humans, invasive species or impact events, can occur anywhere and are not necessarily cyclic. [[extinction vortex|Extinction vortices]] may result in multiple disturbances or a greater frequency of a single disturbance. Immediately after a disturbance there is a pulse of recruitment or regrowth under conditions of little [[Competition (biology)|competition]] for space or other resources. After the initial pulse, recruitment slows since once an individual plant is established it is very difficult to displace.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the varying forms of disturbance this directly impacts the organisms which will exploit the disturbance and create diversity within an ecosystem.

== Cyclic disturbance ==
[[File:Kyrill-Schäden-04.JPG|thumb|Damages of storm [[Kyrill (storm)|Kyrill]] in Wittgenstein, [[Germany]].]]

Often, when disturbances occur naturally, they provide conditions that favor the success of different species over pre-disturbance organisms. This can be attributed to physical changes in the biotic and abiotic conditions of an ecosystem. Because of this, a disturbance force can change an ecosystem for significantly longer than the period over which the immediate effects persist. With the passage of time following a disturbance, shifts in dominance may occur with ephemeral herbaceous life-forms progressively becoming over topped by taller perennials herbs, shrubs and trees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in the absence of further disturbance forces, many ecosystems trend back toward pre-disturbance conditions. Long lived species and those that can regenerate in the presence of their own adults finally become dominant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such alteration, accompanied by changes in the [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] of different species over time, is called [[ecological succession]]. Succession often leads to conditions that will once again predispose an ecosystem to disturbance.

Pine forests in the western North America provide a good example of such a cycle involving insect outbreaks. The [[mountain pine beetle]] (''Dendroctonus ponderosae'') play an important role in limiting pine trees like [[lodgepole pine]] in forests of western North America. In 2004 the beetles affected more than 90,000 square kilometres. The beetles exist in [[endemic]] and [[epidemic]] phases. During epidemic phases swarms of beetles kill large numbers of old pines. This mortality creates openings in the forest for new vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mock | first1 = K.E. | last2 = Bentz | first2 = B.J. | last3 = O'Neill | first3 = E.M. | last4 = Chong | first4 = J.P. | last5 = Orwin | first5 = J. | last6 = Pfrender | first6 = M.E. | year = 2007 | title = Landscape-scale genetic variation in a forest outbreak species, the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) | url = | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 553–568 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2006.03158.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spruce, fir, and younger pines, which are unaffected by the beetles, thrive in canopy openings. Eventually pines grow into the canopy and replace those lost. Younger pines are often able to ward off beetle attacks but, as they grow older, pines become less vigorous and more susceptible to infestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ham | first1 = D.L. | last2 = Hertel | first2 = G.D. | year = 1984 | title = Integrated Pest Management of the Southern Pine Beetle in the Urban Setting | url = | journal = Journal of Arboriculture | volume = 10 | issue = 10| pages = 279–282 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This cycle of death and re-growth creates a temporal mosaic of pines in the forest.&lt;ref&gt;Forest Practices Board. 2007. Lodgepole Pine Stand Structure 25 Years after Mountain Pine Beetle Attack. {{cite web|url=http://www.fpb.gov.bc.ca/special/reports/SR32/Lodgepole_Pine_Stand_Structure_25_Years_after_Mountain_Pine_Beetle_Attack.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029182506/http://www.fpb.gov.bc.ca/special/reports/SR32/Lodgepole_Pine_Stand_Structure_25_Years_after_Mountain_Pine_Beetle_Attack.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar cycles occur in association with other disturbances such as fire and windstorms.

When multiple disturbance events affect the same location in quick succession, this often results in a "compound disturbance," an event which, due to the combination of forces, creates a new situation which is more than the sum of its parts.  For example, windstorms followed by fire can create fire temperatures and durations that are not expected in even severe wildfires, and may have surprising effects on post-fire succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1890/ES11-00038.1|title=Disturbance interactions can impact resilience mechanisms of forests|journal=Ecosphere|volume=2|issue=5|pages=art64|year=2011|last1=Buma|first1=B.|last2=Wessman|first2=C. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental stresses can be described as pressure on the environment, with compounding variables such as extreme temperature or precipitation changes—which all play a role in the diversity and succession of an ecosystem. With environmental moderation, diversity increases because of the intermediate- disturbance effect, decreases because of the competitive-exclusion effect, increases because of the prevention of competitive exclusion by moderate predation, and decreases because of the local extinction of prey by severe predation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Menge|first=A|year=1987|title=Community Regulation: Variation in Disturbance, Competition, and Predation in Relation to Environmental Stress and Recruitment|jstor=2461716|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=130|doi=10.1086/284741}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reduction in recruitment density reduces the importance of competition for a given level of environmental stress.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Species adapted to disturbance ==

[[Image:Greece Forest Fire July 25 2007.jpg|thumb|Forest fire burns on the island of [[Zakynthos]] in [[Greece]] on July 25th, 2007.]]

A disturbance may change a forest significantly. Afterwards, the forest floor is often littered with dead material. This decaying matter and abundant sunlight promote an abundance of new growth. In the case of forest fires a portion of the [[nutrient]]s previously held in plant biomass is returned quickly to the soil as biomass burns. Many plants and animals benefit from disturbance conditions.&lt;ref name="pringle"&gt;Pringle, L. 1979. Natural Fire: Its Ecology in Forests. William Morrow and Company, New York. 27-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some species are particularly suited for exploiting recently disturbed sites. Vegetation with the potential for rapid growth can quickly take advantage of the lack of competition. In the northeastern United States, [[shade-intolerant]] trees like pin cherry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = P.L. | year = 1974 | title = The Role of Pin Cherry (Prunus pensylvanica) in the Maintenance of Stability in Northern Hardwood Ecosystems | url = | journal = Ecological Monographs | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 73–88 | doi=10.2307/1942319}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aspen]] quickly fill in forest gaps created by fire or windstorm (or human disturbance). Silver maple and eastern sycamore are similarly well adapted to floodplains. They are highly tolerant of standing water and will frequently dominate floodplains where other species are periodically wiped out.

When a tree is blown over, gaps typically are filled with small herbaceous [[seedling]]s but, this is not always the case; shoots from the fallen tree can develop and take over the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=J|year=2001|title=Ecology of sprouting in woody plants: the persistence niche|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=16|pages=45–51|via=|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(00)02033-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sprouting ability can have major impacts on the plant population, plant populations that typically would have exploited the tree fall gap get over run and can not compete against the shoots of the fallen tree. Species adaptation to disturbances is species specific but how each organism adapts effects all the species around them.

Another species well adapted to a particular disturbance is the [[Jack Pine]] in boreal forests exposed to crown fires. They, as well as some other pine species, have specialized [[serotinous]] cones that only open and disperse seeds with sufficient heat generated by fire. As a result, this species often dominates in areas where competition has been reduced by fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwilk | first1 = D. | last2 = Ackerly | first2 = D. | year = 2001 | title = Flammability and serotiny as strategies: correlated evolution in pines | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 94 | issue = | pages = 326–336 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.940213.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species that are well adapted for exploiting disturbance sites are referred to as pioneers or early successional species. These [[shade-intolerant species]] are able to photosynthesize at high rates and as a result grow quickly. Their fast growth is usually balanced by short life spans. Furthermore, although these species often dominate immediately following a disturbance, they are unable to compete with shade-tolerant species later on and replaced by these species through succession. However these shifts may not reflect the progressive entry to the community of the taller long-lived forms, but instead, the gradual emergence and dominance of species that may have been present, but inconspicuous directly after the disturbance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While plants must deal directly with disturbances, many animals are not as immediately affected by them. Most can successfully evade fires, and many thrive afterwards on abundant new growth on the forest floor. New conditions support a wider variety of plants, often rich in nutrients compared to pre-disturbance vegetation. The plants in turn support a variety of wildlife, temporarily increasing biological diversity in the forest.&lt;ref name="pringle" /&gt;

== Importance ==

[[Biological diversity]] is dependent on natural disturbance. The success of a wide range of species from all taxonomic groups is closely tied to natural disturbance events such as fire, flooding, and windstorm. As an example, many shade-intolerant plant species rely on disturbances for successful establishment and to limit competition. Without this perpetual thinning, diversity of forest flora can decline, affecting animals dependent on those plants as well.

A good example of this role of disturbance is in [[ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa'') forests in the western United States, where surface fires frequently thin existing vegetation allowing for new growth. If fire is suppressed, [[douglas fir]] (''Pesudotsuga menziesii''), a shade tolerant species, eventually replaces the pines. Douglas firs, having dense crowns, severely limit the amount of sunlight reaching the forest floor. Without sufficient light new growth is severely limited. As the diversity of surface plants decreases, animal species that rely on them diminish as well. Fire, in this case, is important not only to the species directly affected but also to many other organisms whose survival depends on those key plants.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, L. 1979. Natural Fire: Its Ecology in Forests. William Morrow and Company, New York. 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversity is low in harsh environments because of the intolerance of all but opportunistic and highly resistant species to such conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The interplay between disturbance and these biological processes seems to account for a major portion of the organization and spatial patterning of natural communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sousa|first=W|year=1984|title=The Role of Disturbance in Natural Communities|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002033|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=15|pages=353–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Disturbance variability and species diversity are heavily linked, and as a result require adaptations that help increase plant fitness necessary for survival.

'''Fibre-reinforced plastic''' ('''FRP''') (also called '''fiber-reinforced polymer''', or '''fiber-reinforced plastic''') is a [[composite material]] made of a [[polymer]] matrix reinforced with [[fibre]]s. The fibres are usually [[glass fibre|glass]] (in [[fibreglass]]), [[Carbon fibers|carbon]] (in [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]]), [[aramid]], or [[Basalt fibre|basalt]]. Rarely, other fibres such as paper, wood, or [[asbestos]] have been used. The polymer is usually an [[epoxy]], [[vinyl ester resin|vinylester]], or [[polyester]] [[thermosetting plastic]], though [[phenol formaldehyde resin]]s are still in use.

FRPs are commonly used in the aerospace, automotive, marine, and construction industries. They are commonly found in ballistic armor as well.

==Process definition==
A [[polymer]] is generally manufactured by [[step-growth polymerization]] or [[addition polymerization]]. When combined with various agents to enhance or in any way alter the material properties of polymers, the result is referred to as a [[plastic]]. [[Composite material|Composite plastics]] refers to those types of plastics that result from bonding two or more homogeneous materials with different material properties to derive a final product with certain desired material and mechanical properties. Fibre-reinforced plastics are a category of composite plastics that specifically use fibre materials to mechanically enhance the strength and [[Elastic modulus|elasticity]] of plastics.

The original plastic material without fibre reinforcement is known as the [[Composite material#Matrices|matrix]] or [[binder (material)|binding agent]]. The matrix is a tough but relatively weak plastic that is reinforced by stronger stiffer reinforcing filaments or fibres. The extent that strength and elasticity are enhanced in a fibre-reinforced plastic depends on the mechanical properties of both the fibre and matrix, their volume relative to one another, and the fibre length and orientation within the matrix.&lt;ref name="Smallman"&gt;Smallman, R. E., and R.J. Bishop. [https://books.google.com/books?id=S7zWcHBnMzAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Modern+Physical+Metallurgy+and+Materials+Engineering Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering]. 6th ed. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  Reinforcement of the matrix occurs by definition when the FRP material exhibits increased strength or elasticity relative to the strength and elasticity of the matrix alone.&lt;ref name="Gunter"&gt;Erhard, Gunter. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mesU4WbE5CIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Designing+with+Plastics Designing with Plastics]. Trans. Martin Thompson. Munich: Hanser Publishers, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Bakelite]] was the first fibre-reinforced plastic. [[Leo Baekeland]] had originally set out to find a replacement for [[shellac]] (made from the excretion of lac beetles). Chemists had begun to recognize that many natural resins and fibres were polymers, and Baekeland investigated the reactions of phenol and formaldehyde. He first produced a soluble phenol-formaldehyde shellac called "Novolak" that never became a market success, then turned to developing a binder for [[asbestos]] which, at that time, was moulded with rubber. By controlling the pressure and temperature applied to [[phenol]] and [[formaldehyde]], he found in 1905 he could produce his dreamed-of hard mouldable material (the world's first [[synthetic plastic]]): bakelite.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web | last = Amato | first = Ivan | authorlink = | title = Leo Baekeland | work = Time 100 | publisher = [[TIME]] | date = 29 March 1999 | url = http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/baekeland.html | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | last =  | first = | authorlink = | title = Leo Baekeland | work = Plastics | publisher = UK history site | date = 28 June 2000 | url = http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/plastic.htm | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He announced his invention at a meeting of the [[American Chemical Society]] on February 5, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=New Chemical Substance | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 6, 1909 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/02/06/101025892.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of fibre-reinforced plastic for commercial use was being extensively researched in the 1930s. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], considerable research was undertaken by pioneers such as [[Norman de Bruyne]]. It was particularly of interest to the aviation industry.&lt;ref&gt;Synthetic Resin – Use in Aircraft Construction, The Times, London England, Monday 5 October 1936, page 14, Issue 47497&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass production of glass strands was discovered in 1932 when [[Games Slayter]], a researcher at [[Owens-Illinois]] accidentally directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibres. A patent for this method of producing glass wool was first applied for in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=0EMBAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=%22G.+Slayter%22 US Patent Number 2133235: Method &amp; Apparatus for Making Glass Wool] First Slayter glass wool patent, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;
Owens joined with the Corning company in 1935 and the method was adapted by Owens Corning to produce its patented "fibreglas" (one "s") in 1936. Originally, fibreglas was a [[glass wool]] with fibres entrapping a great deal of gas, making it useful as an insulator, especially at high temperatures.

A suitable resin for combining the "fibreglas" with a plastic to produce a composite material, was developed in 1936 by [[du Pont]]. The first ancestor of modern polyester resins is [[Cyanamid]]'s resin of 1942. [[Peroxide]] curing systems were used by then.&lt;ref&gt;50 years of reinforced plastic boats, George Marsh, 8 October 2006, http://www.reinforcedplastics.com/view/1461/50-years-of-reinforced-plastic-boats-/&lt;/ref&gt; With the combination of fibreglas and resin the gas content of the material was replaced by plastic. This reduced the insulation properties to values typical of the plastic, but now for the first time the composite showed great strength and promise as a structural and building material. Confusingly, many glass fibre composites continued to be called "[[fibreglass]]" (as a generic name) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic.

Ray Greene of [[Owens Corning]] is credited with producing the first composite boat in 1937, but did not proceed further at the time due to the brittle nature of the plastic used.

[[Carbon fibre]] production began in the late 1950s and was used, though not widely, in British industry beginning in the early 1960s. Aramid fibres were being produced around this time also, appearing first under the trade name [[Nomex]] by [[DuPont]]. Today, each of these fibres is used widely in industry for any applications that require plastics with specific strength or elastic qualities. Glass fibres are the most common across all industries, although carbon-fibre and carbon-fibre-aramid composites are widely found in aerospace, automotive and sporting good applications.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt; These three ([[glass]], carbon, and [[aramid]]) continue to be the important categories of fibre used in FRP.

Global polymer production on the scale present today began in the mid 20th century, when low material and productions costs, new production technologies and new product categories combined to make polymer production economical. The industry finally matured in the late 1970s when world polymer production surpassed that of [[steel]], making polymers the ubiquitous material that they are today. Fibre-reinforced plastics have been a significant aspect of this industry from the beginning.

==Process description==
FRP involves two distinct processes, the first is the process whereby the fibrous material is manufactured and formed, the second is the process whereby fibrous materials are bonded with the matrix during moulding.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt;

===Fibre===

====Manufacture of fibre fabric====
Reinforcing Fibre is manufactured in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional orientations:
#Two-dimensional fibreglass-reinforced polymer is characterized by a laminated structure in which the fibers are only aligned along the plane in [[Cartesian coordinate system|x-direction, and y-direction]] of the material. This means that no fibers are aligned in the through-thickness or the [[Cartesian coordinate system|z-direction]], this lack of alignment in the through thickness can create a disadvantage in cost and processing. Costs and labor increase because conventional processing techniques used to fabricate composites, such as wet hand lay-up, autoclave and resin transfer molding, require a high amount of skilled labor to cut, stack and consolidate into a preformed component.
#Three-dimensional fiberglass-reinforced polymer composites are materials with three-dimensional fiber structures that incorporate fibers in the [[Cartesian coordinate system|x-direction, y-direction and z-direction]]. The development of three-dimensional orientations arose from industry's need to reduce fabrication costs, to increase through-thickness mechanical properties, and to improve impact damage tolerance; all were problems associated with two-dimensional fibre-reinforced polymers.

==== Manufacture of fibre preforms ====
Fibre preforms are how the fibres are manufactured before being bonded to the matrix. Fibre preforms are often manufactured in sheets, continuous mats, or as continuous filaments for spray applications. The four major ways to manufacture the fibre preform is through the textile processing techniques of [[weaving]], [[knitting]], [[braiding]] and [[Stitch (textile arts)|stitching]].

#Weaving can be done in a conventional manner to produce two-dimensional fibres as well in a multilayer weaving that can create three-dimensional fibres. However, multilayer weaving is required to have multiple layers of warp yarns to create fibres in the z- direction creating a few disadvantages in manufacturing,namely the time to set up all the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] yarns on the [[loom]]. Therefore, most multilayer weaving is currently used to produce relatively narrow width products, or high value products where the cost of the preform production is acceptable. Another one of the main problems facing the use of multilayer woven fabrics is the difficulty in producing a fabric that contains fibres oriented with angles other than 0" and 90" to each other respectively.
#The second major way of manufacturing fibre preforms is Braiding. Braiding is suited to the manufacture of narrow width flat or tubular fabric and is not as capable as weaving in the production of large volumes of wide fabrics. Braiding is done over top of mandrels that vary in cross-sectional shape or dimension along their length. Braiding is limited to objects about a brick in size. Unlike standard weaving, braiding can produce fabric that contains fibres at 45-degree angles to one another. Braiding three-dimensional fibres can be done using four step, two-step or Multilayer Interlock Braiding.Four step or row and column braiding utilizes a flat bed containing rows and columns of yarn carriers that form the shape of the desired preform. Additional carriers are added to the outside of the array, the precise location and quantity of which depends upon the exact preform shape and structure required. There are four separate sequences of row and column motion, which act to interlock the yarns and produce the braided preform. The yarns are mechanically forced into the structure between each step to consolidate the structure in a similar process to the use of a reed in weaving. Two-step braiding is unlike the four-step process because the two-step includes a large number of yarns fixed in the axial direction and a fewer number of braiding yarns. The process consists of two steps in which the braiding carriers move completely through the structure between the axial carriers. This relatively simple sequence of motions is capable of forming preforms of essentially any shape, including circular and hollow shapes. Unlike the four-step process, the two-step process does not require mechanical compaction the motions involved in the process allows the braid to be pulled tight by yarn tension alone. The last type of braiding is multi-layer interlocking braiding that consists of a number of standard circular braiders being joined together to form a cylindrical braiding frame. This frame has a number of parallel braiding tracks around the circumference of the cylinder but the mechanism allows the transfer of yarn carriers between adjacent tracks forming a multilayer braided fabric with yarns interlocking to adjacent layers. The multilayer interlock braid differs from both the four step and two-step braids in that the interlocking yarns are primarily in the plane of the structure and thus do not significantly reduce the in-plane properties of the preform. The four-step and two-step processes produce a greater degree of interlinking as the braiding yarns travel through the thickness of the preform, but therefore contribute less to the in-plane performance of the preform. A disadvantage of the multilayer interlock equipment is that due to the conventional sinusoidal movement of the yarn carriers to form the preform, the equipment is not able to have the density of yarn carriers that is possible with the two step and four step machines.
#Knitting fibre preforms can be done with the traditional methods of Warp and [Weft] Knitting, and the fabric produced is often regarded by many as two-dimensional fabric, but machines with two or more needle beds are capable of producing multilayer fabrics with yams that traverse between the layers. Developments in electronic controls for needle selection and knit loop transfer, and in the sophisticated mechanisms that allow specific areas of the fabric to be held and their movement controlled. This has allowed the fabric to form itself into the required three-dimensional preform shape with a minimum of material wastage.
#Stitching is arguably the simplest of the four main textile manufacturing techniques and one that can be performed with the smallest investment in specialized machinery. Basically stitching consists of inserting a needle, carrying the stitch thread, through a stack of fabric layers to form a 3D structure. The advantages of stitching are that it is possible to stitch both dry and prepreg fabric, although the tackiness of the prepreg makes the process difficult and generally creates more damage within the prepreg material than in the dry fabric. Stitching also utilizes the standard two-dimensional fabrics that are commonly in use within the composite industry therefore there is a sense of familiarity concerning the material systems. The use of standard fabric also allows a greater degree of flexibility in the fabric lay-up of the component than is possible with the other textile processes, which have restrictions on the fibre orientations that can be produced.&lt;ref&gt;Tong, L, A.P. Mouritz, and M.k. Bannister. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QWfsk0_vFWAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=3D+Fibre+Reinforced+Polymer+Composites 3D Fibre-Reinforced Polymer Composites]. Oxford: Elsevier, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forming processes===
A rigid structure is usually used to establish the shape of FRP components. Parts can be laid up on a flat surface referred to as a "caul plate" or on a cylindrical structure referred to as a "mandrel". However, most fibre-reinforced plastic parts are created with a mold or "tool." Molds can be concave female molds, male molds, or the mold can completely enclose the part with a top and bottom mold.

The [[Moulding (process)|moulding processes]] of FRP plastics begins by placing the fibre preform on or in the mold. The fibre preform can be dry fibre, or fibre that already contains a measured amount of resin called "prepreg". Dry fibres are "wetted" with resin either by hand or the resin is injected into a closed mold. The part is then cured, leaving the  matrix and fibres in the shape created by the mold. Heat and/or pressure are sometimes used to cure the resin and improve the quality of the final part.
The different methods of forming are listed below.

====Bladder moulding====
Individual sheets of prepreg material are laid up and placed in a female-style mould along with a balloon-like bladder. The mould is closed and placed in a heated press. Finally, the bladder is pressurized forcing the layers of material against the mould walls.

====Compression moulding====
When the raw material (plastic block,rubber block, plastic sheet, or granules) contains reinforcing fibres, a compression molded part qualifies as a fibre-reinforced plastic. More typically the plastic preform used in compression molding does not contain reinforcing fibres. In compression molding, a "preform" or "charge", of [[Sheet moulding compound|SMC]], BMC is placed into mould cavity. The mould is closed and the material is formed &amp; cured inside by pressure and heat. Compression moulding offers excellent detailing for geometric shapes ranging from pattern and relief detailing to complex curves and creative forms, to [[precision engineering]] all within a maximum curing time of 20 minutes.&lt;ref name="quatro"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215010801/http://www.quatrocomposites.com/comp101proc.htm|title=Quatro Composites Processes 101: Molding Carbon Composite Parts|author=|date=15 February 2008|website=archive.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autoclave and vacuum bag====
Individual sheets of prepreg material are laid-up and placed in an open mold. The material is covered with release film, bleeder/breather material and a [[Composite material#Vacuum bag moulding|vacuum bag]]. A vacuum is pulled on part and the entire mould is placed into an autoclave (heated pressure vessel). The part is cured with a continuous vacuum to extract entrapped gasses from laminate. This is a very common process in the aerospace industry because it affords precise control over moulding due to a long, slow cure cycle that is anywhere from one to several hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dogan|first=Fatih|author2=Hadavinia, Homayoun |author3=Donchev, Todor |author4= Bhonge, Prasannakumar S. |title=Delamination of impacted composite structures by cohesive zone interface elements and tiebreak contact|journal=Central European Journal of Engineering|date=5 August 2012|volume=2|issue=4|pages=612–626|doi=10.2478/s13531-012-0018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This precise control creates the exact laminate geometric forms needed to ensure strength and safety in the aerospace industry, but it is also slow and labour-intensive, meaning costs often confine it to the aerospace industry.&lt;ref name="quatro"/&gt;

====Mandrel wrapping====
Sheets of prepreg material are wrapped around a steel or aluminium mandrel. The prepreg material is compacted by nylon or polypropylene cello tape. Parts are typically batch cured by vacuum bagging and hanging in an oven. After cure, the cello and mandrel are removed leaving a hollow carbon tube. This process creates strong and robust hollow carbon tubes.

====Wet layup====
Wet layup forming combines fibre reinforcement and the matrix as they are placed on the forming tool.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt; Reinforcing Fibre layers are placed in an open mould and then saturated with a wet [[resin]] by pouring it over the fabric and working it into the fabric. The mould is then left so that the resin will cure, usually at room temperature, though heat is sometimes used to ensure a proper cure. Sometimes a vacuum bag is used to compress a wet layup. Glass fibres are most commonly used for this process, the results are widely known as [[fibreglass]], and is used to make common products like skis, canoes, kayaks and surf boards.&lt;ref name="quatro"/&gt;

====Chopper gun====
Continuous strands of fibreglass are pushed through a hand-held gun that both chops the strands and combines them with a catalysed resin such as polyester. The impregnated chopped glass is shot onto the mould surface in whatever thickness and design the human operator thinks is appropriate. This process is good for large production runs at economical cost, but produces geometric shapes with less strength than other moulding processes and has poor dimensional tolerance.&lt;ref name="quatro"/&gt;

====Filament winding====
[[Continuous filament winding machine|Machines]] pull fibre bundles through a wet bath of resin and wound over a rotating steel mandrel in specific orientations Parts are cured either room temperature or elevated temperatures. Mandrel is extracted, leaving a final geometric shape but can be left in some cases.&lt;ref name="quatro"/&gt;

====Pultrusion====
Fibre bundles and slit fabrics are pulled through a wet bath of resin and formed into the rough part shape. Saturated material is extruded from a heated closed die curing while being continuously pulled through die. Some of the end products of pultrusion are structural shapes, i.e. I beam, angle, channel and flat sheet. These materials can be used to create all sorts of fibreglass structures such as ladders, platforms, handrail systems tank, pipe and pump supports.&lt;ref name="quatro"/&gt;

====Resin transfer molding====
Also called '''resin infusion'''. Fabrics are placed into a mould into which wet resin is then injected. Resin is typically pressurized and forced into a cavity which is under vacuum in [[Out of autoclave composite manufacturing|resin transfer molding]]. Resin is entirely pulled into cavity under vacuum in vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding. This moulding process allows precise tolerances and detailed shaping, but can sometimes fail to fully saturate the fabric leading to weak spots in the final shape.&lt;ref name="quatro"/&gt;

==Advantages and limitations==
FRP allows the alignment of the glass fibres of thermoplastics to suit specific design programs. Specifying the orientation of reinforcing fibres can increase the strength and resistance to deformation of the polymer. Glass reinforced polymers are strongest and most resistive to deforming forces when the polymers fibres are parallel to the force being exerted, and are weakest when the fibres are perpendicular. Thus, this ability is at once both an advantage or a limitation depending on the context of use. Weak spots of perpendicular fibres can be used for natural hinges and connections, but can also lead to material failure when production processes fail to properly orient the fibres parallel to expected forces. When forces are exerted perpendicular to the orientation of fibres, the strength and elasticity of the polymer is less than the matrix alone. In cast resin components made of glass reinforced polymers such as UP and EP, the orientation of fibres can be oriented in two-dimensional and three-dimensional weaves. This means that when forces are possibly perpendicular to one orientation, they are parallel to another orientation; this eliminates the potential for weak spots in the polymer.

===Failure modes===
Structural failure can occur in FRP materials when:
*Tensile forces stretch the matrix more than the fibres, causing the material to shear at the interface between matrix and fibres.
*Tensile forces near the end of the fibres exceed the tolerances of the matrix, separating the fibres from the matrix.
*Tensile forces can also exceed the tolerances of the fibres causing the fibres themselves to fracture leading to material failure.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt;

==Material requirements==
{{see also|Basalt fibre}}
A [[thermoset polymer matrix]] material, or engineering grade thermoplastic polymer matrix material, must meet certain requirements in order to first be suitable for FRPs and ensure a successful reinforcement of itself. The matrix must be able to properly saturate, and preferably bond chemically with the fibre reinforcement for maximum adhesion within a suitable curing period. The matrix must also completely envelop the fibres to protect them from cuts and notches that would reduce their strength, and to transfer forces to the fibres. The fibres must also be kept separate from each other so that if failure occurs it is localized as much as possible, and if failure occurs the matrix must also debond from the fibre for similar reasons. Finally, the matrix should be of a plastic that remains chemically and physically stable during and after the reinforcement and moulding processes. To be suitable as reinforcement material, fibre additives must increase the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of the matrix and meet the following conditions; fibres must exceed critical fibre content; the strength and rigidity of fibres itself must exceed the strength and rigidity of the matrix alone; and there must be optimum bonding between fibres and matrix

===Glass fibre===
{{further|Fibreglass}}
"Fibreglass reinforced plastics" or FRPs (commonly referred to simply as [[fibreglass]]) use textile grade [[glass fibre]]s. These textile fibres are different from other forms of glass fibres used to deliberately trap air, for insulating applications (see [[glass wool]]). Textile glass fibres begin as varying combinations of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CaO, or MgO in powder form. These mixtures are then heated through direct melting to temperatures around 1300 degrees Celsius, after which dies are used to extrude filaments of glass fibre in diameter ranging from 9 to 17&amp;nbsp;µm. These filaments are then wound into larger threads and spun onto bobbins for transportation and further processing. Glass fibre is by far the most popular means to reinforce plastic and thus enjoys a wealth of production processes, some of which are applicable to aramid and carbon fibres as well owing to their shared fibrous qualities.

Roving is a process where filaments are spun into larger diameter threads. These threads are then commonly used for woven reinforcing glass fabrics and mats, and in spray applications.

Fibre fabrics are web-form fabric reinforcing material that has both warp and weft directions. Fibre mats are web-form non-woven mats of glass fibres. Mats are manufactured in cut dimensions with chopped fibres, or in continuous mats using continuous fibres. Chopped fibre glass is used in processes where lengths of glass threads are cut between 3 and 26&amp;nbsp;mm, threads are then used in plastics most commonly intended for moulding processes. Glass fibre short strands are short 0.2–0.3&amp;nbsp;mm strands of glass fibres that are used to reinforce thermoplastics most commonly for injection moulding.

===Carbon fibre===
{{main article|carbon (fibre)|l1=Carbon fibre}}

Carbon fibres are created when polyacrylonitrile fibres (PAN), Pitch resins, or Rayon are carbonized (through oxidation and thermal pyrolysis) at high temperatures. Through further processes of graphitizing or stretching, the fibres strength or elasticity can be enhanced respectively. Carbon fibres are manufactured in diameters analogous to glass fibres with diameters ranging from 4 to 17&amp;nbsp;µm. These fibres wound into larger threads for transportation and further production processes.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt;  Further production processes include weaving or braiding into carbon fabrics, cloths and mats analogous to those described for glass that can then be used in actual reinforcements.&lt;ref name="Smallman"/&gt;

===Aramid fibre===
{{main article|Aramid|l1=Aramid}}
Aramid fibres are most commonly known as Kevlar, Nomex and Technora. Aramids are generally prepared by the reaction between an amine group and a carboxylic acid halide group (aramid);.&lt;ref name="Smallman"/&gt; Commonly, this occurs when an aromatic polyamide is spun from a liquid concentration of sulphuric acid into a crystallized fibre.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt; Fibres are then spun into larger threads in order to weave into large ropes or woven fabrics (Aramid).&lt;ref name="Smallman"/&gt; Aramid fibres are manufactured with varying grades to based on varying qualities for strength and rigidity, so that the material can be somewhat tailored to specific design needs concerns, such as cutting the tough material during manufacture.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Glass-aramid-hybrid-area used-for-reinforced-plastics.jpg|thumb|Glass-aramid-hybrid fabric (for high tension and compression)]]
Fibre-reinforced plastics are best suited for any design program that demands weight savings, precision engineering, finite tolerances, and the simplification of parts in both production and operation. A moulded polymer artefact is cheaper, faster, and easier to manufacture than cast aluminium or steel artefact, and maintains similar and sometimes better tolerances and material strengths.

=== Structural applications ===
FRP can be applied to strengthen the [[Beam (structure)|beams]], [[column]]s, and [[Concrete slab|slabs]] of buildings and bridges. It is possible to increase the strength of structural members even after they have been severely damaged due to [[Structural loads|loading]] conditions. In the case of damaged [[reinforced concrete]] members, this would first require the repair of the member by removing loose debris and filling in cavities and cracks with [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or [[Epoxy|epoxy resin]]. Once the member is repaired, strengthening can be achieved through wet, hand lay-up of impregnating the [[Carbon (fibre)|fibre sheets]] with epoxy resin then applying them to the cleaned and prepared surfaces of the member.

Two techniques are typically adopted for the strengthening of beams, relating to the strength enhancement desired: [[flexural strength]]ening or [[shear strength]]ening. In many cases it may be necessary to provide both strength enhancements. For the flexural strengthening of a beam, FRP sheets or plates are applied to the tension face of the member (the bottom face for a simply supported member with applied top loading or gravity loading). Principal tensile fibres are oriented in the beam longitudinal axis, similar to its internal flexural steel reinforcement. This increases the beam strength and its [[stiffness]] ([[structural load|load]] required to cause unit deflection), however decreases the [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection capacity]] and ductility.

For the shear strengthening of a beam, the FRP is applied on the web (sides) of a member with fibres oriented transverse to the beam's longitudinal axis. Resisting of shear forces is achieved in a similar manner as [[rebar|internal steel stirrups]], by bridging shear cracks that form under applied loading. FRP can be applied in several configurations, depending on the exposed faces of the member and the degree of strengthening desired, this includes: side bonding, U-wraps (U-jackets), and closed wraps (complete wraps). Side bonding involves applying FRP to the sides of the beam only. It provides the least amount of shear strengthening due to failures caused by [[Adhesive#Failure of the adhesive joint|de-bonding]] from the concrete surface at the FRP free edges. For U-wraps, the FRP is applied continuously in a 'U' shape around the sides and bottom (tension) face of the beam. If all faces of a beam are accessible, the use of closed wraps is desirable as they provide the most strength enhancement. Closed wrapping involves applying FRP around the entire perimeter of the member, such that there are no free ends and the typical failure mode is [[fracture|rupture]] of the fibres. For all wrap configurations, the FRP can be applied along the length of the member as a continuous sheet or as discrete strips, having a predefined minimum width and spacing.

Slabs may be strengthened by applying FRP strips at their bottom (tension) face. This will result in better flexural performance, since the tensile resistance of the slabs is supplemented by the tensile strength of FRP. In the case of beams and slabs, the effectiveness of FRP strengthening depends on the performance of the resin chosen for bonding. This is particularly an issue for shear strengthening using side bonding or U-wraps. Columns are typically wrapped with FRP around their perimeter, as with closed or complete wrapping. This not only results in higher shear resistance, but more crucial for [[reinforced concrete column|column design]], it results in increased compressive strength under axial loading. The FRP wrap works by restraining the lateral expansion of the column, which can enhance confinement in a similar manner as spiral reinforcement does for the column core.

=== Elevator cable ===
In June 2013, KONE elevator company announced Ultrarope for use as a replacement for steel cables in elevators. It seals the carbon fibres in high-friction [[polymer]]. Unlike steel cable, Ultrarope was designed for buildings that require up to 1,000 meters of lift. Steel elevators top out at 500 meters. The company estimated that in a 500-meter-high building, an elevator would use 15 per cent less electrical power than a steel-cabled version. As of June 2013, the product had passed all European Union and US certification tests.&lt;ref name="phys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-06-ultrarope-one-stop-tall.html |title=UltraRope announced to one-stop zoom up tall buildings |publisher=Phys.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design considerations==
FRP is used in designs that require a measure of strength or modulus of elasticity that non-reinforced plastics and other material choices are either ill-suited for mechanically or economically. This means that the primary design consideration for using FRP is to ensure that the material is used economically and in a manner that takes advantage of its structural enhancements specifically. This is however not always the case, the orientation of fibres also creates a material weakness perpendicular to the fibres. Thus the use of fibre reinforcement and their orientation affects the strength, rigidity, and elasticity of a final form and hence the operation of the final product itself. Orienting the direction of fibres either, unidirectional, 2-dimensionally, or 3-dimensionally during production affects the degree of strength, flexibility, and elasticity of the final product. Fibres oriented in the direction of forces display greater resistance to distortion from these forces and vice versa, thus areas of a product that must withstand forces will be reinforced with fibres in the same direction, and areas that require flexibility, such as natural hinges, will use fibres in a perpendicular direction to forces.

Using more dimensions avoids this either-or scenario and creates objects that seek to avoid any specific weak points due to the unidirectional orientation of fibres. The properties of strength, flexibility and elasticity can also be magnified or diminished through the geometric shape and design of the final product. These include such design consideration such as ensuring proper wall thickness and creating multifunctional geometric shapes that can be moulding as single pieces, creating shapes that have more material and structural integrity by reducing joints, connections, and hardware.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt;

===Disposal and recycling concerns===
As a subset of plastic FR plastics are liable to a number of the issues and concerns in [[plastic pollution|plastic waste]] disposal and recycling. Plastics pose a particular challenge in recycling because they are derived from polymers and monomers that often cannot be separated and returned to their virgin states, for this reason not all plastics can be recycled for re-use, in fact some estimates claim only 20% to 30% of plastics can be recycled at all. Fibre-reinforced plastics and their matrices share these disposal and environmental concerns. Investigation of safe disposal methods has led to two main variations involving the application of intense heat: in one binding agents are burned off - in the process recapturing some of the sunk material cost in the form of heat - and incombustible elements captured by filtration; in the other the incombustible material is burned in a cement kiln, the fibres becoming an integral part of the resulting cast material.&lt;ref&gt;https://compositesuk.co.uk/system/files/documents/Composite%20Recycling.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to concerns regarding safe disposal  the fact that the fibres themselves are difficult to remove from the matrix and preserve for re-use means FRP's amplify these challenges. FRP's are inherently difficult to separate into base materials, that is into fibre and matrix, and the matrix is difficult to separate into usable plastics, polymers, and monomers. These are all concerns for environmentally-informed design today. Plastics do often offer savings in energy and economic savings in comparison to other materials. In addition, with the advent of new more environmentally friendly matrices such as [[bioplastic]]s and [[ultraviolet|UV]]-degradable plastics, FRP will gain environmental sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Smallman"/&gt;

'''National Financial Literacy Month''' is recognized in the United States in April in an effort to highlight the importance of [[financial literacy]] and teach Americans how to establish and maintain healthy financial habits.&lt;ref&gt;Senate Resolution 316; sponsored by Sen. Daniel Akaka D-HI&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, The National Endowment for Financial Education introduced Youth Financial Literacy Day and turned it over to the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy so that the event would not promote any one organization and instead focus on financial literacy as a whole. The Jump$tart Coalition and its approximately 150 partners expanded the event to a month.
  
In 2003, the [[United States Senate]] designated April as ''Financial Literacy for Youth Month''. In March 2004 the Senate passed Resolution 316 that officially recognized April as ''National Financial Literacy Month''.

Many{{Weasel-inline|date=May 2010}} of the country’s [[financial institutions]] and [[nonprofit]] financial educational organizations promote the month{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} by holding promotional events and creating educational materials that center around effectively handling money and dealing with debt.

==Educational initiatives==
{{see also|Financial Literacy Curriculum}}
[[Money Management International]], a nonprofit credit and debt counseling firm, created a [[microsite]] to support the mission of National Financial Literacy Month, with a step by step process for improving financial wellness.

==Government support==
In 2003 the [[United States Congress]] showed its support for the idea of a financial literacy month. Senate Resolution 48 and House Resolution 127 asked President [[George W. Bush]] to declare April Financial Literacy for Youth Month. At that time, governors of eight states had already named the month of April as such.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jumpstartcoalition.org/fileuptemp/AprilFinancialLiteracyMonth.doc&lt;/ref&gt; April was named National Financial Literacy Month by the passing of Senate Resolution 316 with [[unanimous consent]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jumpstartcoalition.org/fileuptemp/AprilFinancialLiteracyMonth.doc and http://www.jumpstartcoalition.org/fileuptemp/FINAL%20PR%202004%20Legislator%20Award.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a bill supporting the goals and ideals of Financial Literacy Month.&lt;ref name=2005house&gt;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:HE00148:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;  This bill, and the resolution passed by the Senate, called on President Bush to issue a proclamation calling on Federal Government, States, localities, schools, nonprofit organizations business and the people of the United States to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.&lt;ref name=2005house/&gt; During his term in office, President Bush did not issue a proclamation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

During Financial Literacy Month in 2006, The [[Financial Literacy and Education Commission]] unveiled a new national strategy in their report "Taking Ownership of the Future: The National Strategy for Financial Literacy". The report outlined a series of outreach and education goals for the public and private sectors aimed to help Americans improve their understanding of financial issues such as credit management, savings, and homeownership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mymoney.gov/pdfs/ownership.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the years, multiple states have also proclaimed April as Financial Literacy Month including [http://www.cscuf.coop/repository/arkansas+proclamation.pdf Arkansas], [http://www.cscuf.coop/repository/Oklahoma+April+Proclamation+optimized.pdf Oklahoma], [http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2017&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=R&amp;bn=0777 Pennsylvania], and [http://www.cscuf.coop/repository/Texas+April+Proclamation.pdf Texas].

==Financial Literacy Month in Canada==
Differing from the US, November is Canada’s Financial Literacy Month. The month is organized by the Financial Literacy Action Group (FLAG), a coalition of 7 non-profit organizations who work with the federal government body [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]] (FCAC).

Throughout November FLAG organizes events across Canada to educate and engage with the public regarding the need for financial literacy and promote services available to the public: 
“[FLAG] raises awareness of the need for financial literacy and highlights the programs, services and tools available to help Canadians improve their financial knowledge, skills and confidence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialliteracymonth.ca/en/about-flm&lt;/ref&gt;”

The purpose of this month is to educate the public so Canadians are equipped to:

- Provide for themselves and their family

- Invest in their future and the future of their children

- Understand their financial rights and obligations

- Contribute to the community as a good citizen

Similar to the United States, many of the country’s [[financial institutions]] (such as Planswell, Wealthsimple, RBC) and [[nonprofit]] financial educational organizations promote the month by creating educational material and hosting promotional events that center around topics of personal finances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22835">'''Forensic biology''' is the [[Applied science|application]] of [[biology]] to associate a person(s), whether suspect or victim, to a location, an item (or collection of items), another person (victim or suspect, respectively).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Forensic Science|last=Houck|first=Max|last2=Siegal|first2=Jay|publisher=Academic Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-12-356762-8|location=China|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be utilized to further investigations for both criminal and civil cases. Two of the most important factors to be constantly considered throughout the collection, processing, and analysis of evidence, are the maintenance of chain of custody as well as contamination prevention, especially considering the nature of the majority of biological evidence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Techniques of Crime Scene Investigation|last=Fisher|first=Barry A.

When the phrase "forensic biology" is utilized, it is often regarded as synonymous with [[DNA Analysis|DNA analysis]] of biological evidence. {{Forensic science|physio}}

==Disciplines==

===DNA analysis===
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is one of the most popular pieces of evidence to recover at a crime scene.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More often than not, evidence containing DNA is regarded to as ''biological evidence''. With all of the substantial advances that have been made regarding DNA, biological evidence is recognized to be the golden standard in forensic science.

At the scene, biological evidence must be initially visibly recognized. Sometimes this is not always possible and the aid of an alternative light source, or ALS, is required. Once identified as a potential source, presumptive tests are conducted to establish the possibility of the specified biological presence (semen, saliva, blood, urine, etc.).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If positive, samples are collected and submitted for analysis in the laboratory, where confirmatory tests and further tests are performed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[DNA Analysis|DNA analysis]] has numerous applications such as paternity testing, identifications of unknown human remains, cold case breakthroughs, as well as connecting suspects and/or victims to a piece(s) of evidence, a scene, or to another person (victim or suspect, respectively).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nuclear DNA evidence can be recovered from [[blood]], [[semen]], [[saliva]], [[epithelial cells]] and [[hair]] (if the root is still intact).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, [[Mitochondrial DNA]] can be recovered from the shaft of hair, [[bone]] and the roots of [[teeth]]. For most forensic DNA samples, [[STR analysis]] of autosomal short tandem repeats is performed in an attempt to individualize the sample to one person with a high degree of statistical confidence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Using DNA to Solve Cold Cases|last=National Institute of Justice|first=Office of Justice Programs|publisher=|year=July 2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TaqMan Probes.jpg|thumb|TaqMan Probes]][[File:STR electropherogram of a three person mixture.jpg|thumb|STR electropherogram of a three person mixture]]
Laboratory analysis of DNA evidence involves the sample DNA being [[DNA extraction|extracted]], quantitated, amplified, and visualized. There are several methods of DNA extraction possible including [[Phenol-chloroform extraction|organic (phenol-chloroform) extraction]], [[Chelex 100|Chelex]] extraction, and [[differential extraction]]. Quantitation is commonly conducted using a form of the [[polymerase chain reaction]], known as [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|real-time PCR]], quantitative PCR, or qPCR.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Higuchi |first1=R. |last2=Fockler |first2=C. |last3=Dollinger |first3=G. |last4=Watson |first4=R. |title=Kinetic PCR analysis: real-time monitoring of DNA amplification reactions |journal=Bio/Technology |date=1993 |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=1026–1030 |doi=10.1038/nbt0993-1026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Higuchi |first1=R. |last2=Dollinger |first2=G. |last3=Walsh |first3=P.S. |last4=Griffith |first4=R. |title=Simultaneous amplification and detection of specific DNA sequences |journal=Bio/Technology |date=1992 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=413–417 |doi=10.1038/nbt0492-413}}&lt;/ref&gt; qPCR is the preferred method of DNA quantitation for forensic cases because it is very precise, human-specific, qualitative, and quantitative.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Forensic DNA Typing: Biology, Technology, and Genetics of STR Markers |date=2005 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Burlington, MA, USA |isbn=0-12-147952-8 |pages=75–79 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique analyses changes in fluorescence signals of amplified DNA fragments between each PCR cycle without needing to pause the reaction or open the temperature-sensitive PCR tubes.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"/&gt; In addition to the components necessary for standard a PCR reaction (i.e. template DNA, carefully designed forward and reverse [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]], [[DNA polymerase]] [usually ''[[Taq polymerase|Taq]]''], [[Nucleoside triphosphate|dNTPs]], and a buffer solution containing Mg2+), qPCR reactions involve fluorescent dye-labelled [[Hybridization probe|probes]] that complement and anneal to the DNA sequence of interest that lies between the two primers.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"/&gt; A “reporter” (R) dye is attached at the 5’ end of the fluorescent probe while a “quencher” (Q) dye is attached at the 3’ end. Before the DNA strands are extended by the polymerase, the reporter and quencher are close enough in space that no fluorescence is detected by the [[Quantitative PCR instrument|instrument]] (the quencher completely absorbs/masks the fluorescence of the reporter). As the polymerase begins to extend the strand, the 5' end of the probe is degraded by the polymerase due to its [[exonuclease]] activity. The reporter dye is released from the 5’ end and is no longer quenched, thus enabling detection of fluorescence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; A graph is constructed for the sample DNA comparing the presence of fluorescence (y-axis) to cycle number (x-axis) of the qPCR process. This is then compared to a standard curve of the cycle fluorescence threshold (y-axis) versus the log of known DNA concentrations (x-axis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Forensic DNA Typing: Biology, Technology, and Genetics of STR Markers |date=2005 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Burlington, MA, USA |isbn=0-12-147952-8 |page=78 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing the sample data to the standard curve, one may extrapolate the DNA concentration in the sample, which is essential to move forward with PCR amplification and [[capillary electrophoresis]] to obtain a [[genetic fingerprinting|DNA profile]]. DNA profiles are produced in the form of an [[electropherogram]]. The obtained profile can be compared to known samples such as those in [[CODIS]] in order to identify a possible suspect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Based on known frequencies of the [[genotype]] found in the DNA profile, the DNA analyst may place a statistical measure of confidence on DNA match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Advanced Topics in Forensic DNA Typing: Interpretation |date=2015 |publisher=Academic Press |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-0-12-405213-0 |pages=213–444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mitochondrial DNA analysis ====
[[Mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) is used instead of nuclear DNA when forensic samples have been degraded, are damaged, or are in very small quantities. In many cases there may be human remains that are older, sometimes ancient, and the only options for DNA collection are the bone, teeth, or hair of the body.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic DNA Typing: Biology, Technology, and Genetics of STR Markers, Second Edition|last=Butler|first=John|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|year=2005|isbn=0121479528|location=London, UK|pages=241–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; mtDNA is able to be extracted from such degraded samples because its presence in cells is much higher than nuclear DNA. There can be more than 1,000 copies of mtDNA in a cell, while there are only two copies of nuclear DNA.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Nuclear DNA is inherited from both the mother and the father but mtDNA is passed down from only the mother to all of her offspring.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Due to this type of inheritance, mtDNA is useful for identification purposes in forensic work but can also be used for mass disasters, missing persons cases, complex kinship, and genetic genealogy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As mentioned, the main advantage of using mtDNA is its high copy number. However, there are a few disadvantages of using mtDNA as opposed to nuclear DNA. Since mtDNA is inherited maternally and passed to each offspring, all members of the maternal familial line will share a [[haplotype]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jobling|first=Mark A.|last2=Gill|first2=Peter|date=October 2004|title=Correction: Encoded evidence: DNA in forensic analysis|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1455.pdf|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=En|volume=5|issue=10|pages=739–751|doi=10.1038/nrg1455|issn=1471-0056}}&lt;/ref&gt; A haplotype "is a group of alleles in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Haplotype|date=2018-04-19|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Haplotype&amp;oldid=837214748|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sharing of this haplotype among family members can cause an issue in forensic samples because these samples are often mixtures that contain more than one DNA contributor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Deconvolution and interpretation of mtDNA mixtures is more difficult than that of nuclear DNA and some laboratories choose not to attempt the process&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/36c9/9e996c645ede5c596c692356c6aef1660ff8.pdf?_ga=2.268566321.1937055804.1541653920-1523377491.1541653920|title=Forensic Mitochondrial DNA Analysis: Current Practice and Future Potential|last=Melton|first=T.|date=July 2012|website=Semantic Scholar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since mtDNA does not recombine, the genetic markers are not as diverse as autosomal STRs are in the case of nuclear DNA.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another issue is that of [[heteroplasmy]]. Heteroplasmy is when an individual has more than one type of mtDNA in their cells.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This can cause an issue in the interpretation of data from questioned forensic samples and known samples that contain mtDNA.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melton|first=Terry|date=2004|title=Mitochondrial DNA Heteroplasmy|url=http://mitotyping.com/PDF/MtDNA_Heteroplasmy_Melton_FSR.pdf|journal=Forensic Science Review|volume=16|pages=1–20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having adequate knowledge and understanding of heteroplasmy can help ensure successful interpretation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

There are some ways to improve success of mtDNA analysis. Preventing contamination at all testing stages and using positive and negative controls is a priority.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In addition, the use of mini-amplicons can be beneficial. When a sample of mtDNA is severely degraded or has been obtained from an ancient source, the use of small [[amplicon]]s can be used to improve the success of amplification during [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In these cases primers amplifying smaller regions of HV1 and HV2 in the control region of mtDNA are used. This process has been referred to as the 'ancient DNA' approach.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The first use of mtDNA as evidence in court was in 1996 in ''State of Tennessee v. Paul Ware''.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/profiles-in-dna/103/mitochondrial-dna-state-of-tennessee-v-paul-ware.pdf?la=en|title=Mitochondrial DNA: State of Tennessee v. Paul Ware|last=Davis|first=C. Leland|date=1998|website=Promega|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was only circumstantial evidence against Ware so the admittance of mtDNA from hairs found in the victim’s throat and at the scene were key to the case.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 2004, with the help of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and ChoicePoint, mtDNA was used to solve a 22-year-old cold case where the nuclear DNA evidence was not originally strong enough.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/public-safety/DNA-Profiling-Helps-Solve-22-year-old-Murder.html|title=DNA Profiling Helps Solve 22-year-old Murder Case|website=www.govtech.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After mtDNA analysis, Arbie Dean Williams was convicted of the murder of 15-year-old Linda Strait, which had occurred in 1982.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In 2012, mtDNA evidence allowed investigators to establish a link in a 36-year-old investigation into the murder of four Michigan children.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2012/07/17/justice/michigan-dna-cold-case/index.html|title=New DNA work may offer break in 36-year-old Michigan slayings - CNN|last=CNN|first=By Chris Boyette,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hair fibers found on the bodies of two of the children were tested and the mtDNA found to be the same for each sample. For the investigators this was a big break because it meant that the murders were likely connected.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===[[Forensic anthropology]]===
[[Anthropology]] is applied to forensics most regularly through the collection and analysis of human skeletal remains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The primary goals of anthropological involvement include identification and aiding in scene reconstruction by determining details regarding the circumstances of the victim's death. In cases where conventional techniques are unable to determine the identity of the remains due to the lack of soft tissue, anthropologists are required to deduce certain characteristics based on the skeletal remains. Race, sex, age and possible ailments can often be determined through bone measurements and looking for clues throughout the skeletal structure.

===Forensic odontology===
Odontologists or [[dentistry|dentists]] can be used in order to aid in an identification of degraded remains. Remains that have been buried for a long period or which have undergone fire damage often contain few clues to the identity of the individual. [[Tooth enamel]], as the hardest substance in the human body, often endures and as such odontologists can in some circumstances compare recovered remains to dental records.

===Forensic pathology===
A [[Forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] is a medical doctor who is an expert in both trauma and disease and is responsible for performing autopsies. He/she applies their extensive knowledge of the human body and possible internal and external inflictions as he/she performs an autopsy, to hopefully ascertain the manner and cause of death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Information derived from the autopsy often greatly assists investigative efforts as well as scene reconstruction.

===Forensic toxicology===
[[Forensic toxicology]] is the use of [[toxicology]] and other disciplines such as [[analytical chemistry]], [[pharmacology]] and [[clinical chemistry]] to aid medical or legal investigation of death, poisoning, and drug use. The primary concern for forensic toxicology is not the legal outcome of the toxicological investigation or the technology utilized, but rather the obtainment and interpretation of results.

== Forensic microbiology ==
With recent advances in [[massive parallel sequencing]] (MPS), or [[next-generation sequencing]] (NGS), forensic microbiology has become an increasingly promising area of research. “Initial applications in circumstances of biocrime, bioterrorism and epidemiology are now accompanied by the prospect of using microorganisms (i) as ancillary evidence in criminal cases; (ii) to clarify causes of death (e.g., drownings, toxicology, hospital-acquired infections, sudden infant death and shaken baby syndromes); (iii) to assist human identification (skin, hair and body fluid microbiomes); (iv) for geolocation (soil microbiome); and (v) to estimate postmortem interval (thanatomicrobiome and epinecrotic microbial community)”.&lt;ref&gt;Oliveira, M. &amp; Amorim, A. Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2018). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-9414-6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioterrorism and epidemiology ===
“It is important to remember that biological agents that can be used as weapons are often found in the environment. For this reason, it is always difficult to determine whether infections associated with these bioagents are accidental or purposely started”.&lt;ref&gt;González, Alfredo A., Jessica I. Rivera-Pérez, Gary A. Toranzos. Forensic Approaches to Detect Possible Agents of Bioterror. Microbiology Spectrum April 2017 vol. 5 no. 2.
doi:10.1128/microbiolspec.EMF-0010-2016
&lt;/ref&gt; While not the first, or only, incidence of bioterrorism, perhaps the most notable case in recent memory involved the sending of at least four anthrax-containing envelopes in the United States in September and October 2001. “At least 22 victims contracted anthrax as a result of the mailings: 11 individuals contracted inhalation anthrax, with 5 of these infections resulting in fatalities; another 11 individuals suffered cutaneous anthrax. In addition, 31 persons tested positive for exposure to B. anthracis spores”.&lt;ref&gt;Rasko, David A.,a Patricia L. Worsham,b Terry G. Abshire,b Scott T. Stanley,c,1 Jason D. Bannan,d Mark R. Wilson,d,2Richard J. Langham,c R. Scott Decker,c,3 Lingxia Jiang,a,4 Timothy D. Read,e Adam M. Phillippy,f Steven L. Salzberg,fMihai Pop,f Matthew N. Van Ert,g,h Leo J. Kenefic,g,h,5 Paul S. Keim,g,h Claire M. Fraser-Liggett,i and Jacques Ravela,6. Bacillus anthracis comparative genome analysis in support of the Amerithrax investigation. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Mar 22; 108(12): 5027–5032
doi:10.1073/pnas.1016657108
&lt;/ref&gt; However, thanks to advancements in PCR and whole-genome sequencing, scientists were able to collaborate with the FBI and were able to identify the source of the letter spores.

=== Postmortem analysis ===
“Post-mortem microbiology (PMM) aims to detect unexpected infections causing sudden deaths; confirm clinically suspected but unproven infection; evaluate the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy; identify emergent pathogens; and recognize medical errors. Additionally, the analysis of the thanatomicrobiome may help to estimate the post-mortem interval.”.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Rodríguez, A.,1 J.L.Burton2 L.Andreoletti3 J.Alberola4 P.Fornes5 I.Merino67 M.J.Martínez89 P.Castillo810 B.Sampaio-Maia11 I.M.Caldas12 V.Saegeman13 M.C.Cohen14 ESGFOR and the ESP. Postmortem microbiology in sudden death: sampling protocols proposed in different clinical settings. Clinical Microbiology and Infection.
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2018.08.009
&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently an extensive amount of research being performed, most notably using the famous “body farms” throughout the United States, to determine if there is a consistent microbial decomposition “clock” that could be used by itself, or in conjunction with other techniques (such as forensic entomology) to help estimate postmortem intervals.

== Current issues ==

=== Sexual assault kit backlog ===
Prior to DNA testing, many sexual assault cases could only rely on "his said, she said" and possible witnesses. Even once DNA analysis was available, many sexual assault kits, or SAKs, were never tested and thrown into a backroom or storage facility, only to be forgotten about until discovered. Now that DNA analysis is frequently utilized in the majority of cases, most SAKs are examined and analyzed. However, the issue remains about the preexisting SAKs that have never been tested. A prevalent issue then, that still extends to now, is the absence of funds to actually process and analyze these SAKs. Many districts would dedicate their funds to homicides or more high profile cases and sexual assaults would be swept to the side. The biggest concern about all of these SAKs, is how to go about processing all of them, especially as more and more are being found each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo67935/249234.pdf|title=Creating a Plan to Test a Large Number of Sexual Assault Kits|last=National Institute of Justice|first=|date=March 2016|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cold cases ===
With the considerable amount of advances in DNA analysis, old, open cases that still have intact evidence can be examined for biological evidence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; New profiles are uploaded to [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]] everyday so the base population to search and compare to increases. Biological testing for cold cases, specifically homicides, encounter similar roadblocks as the SAKs - lack of funds or the DNA samples have not been properly stored thus too much degradation has occurred for viable analyses.

==Popular culture==

In popular culture, forensic biology is frequently portrayed in shows like ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI]]'', ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' and ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]''. However thanks to Hollywood's depiction of forensic science, the analysis of biological evidence has fallen prey to the [[CSI effect|CSI Effect]], which results in the public's perception of its capabilities being severely distorted and its limits blurred.

{{Redirect|Big Freeze}}
{{Cosmology|expansion}}
Observations suggest that the [[Expansion of the universe|expansion]] of the [[universe]] will continue forever. If so, then a popular theory is that the universe will cool as it expands, eventually becoming too cold to sustain [[life]].  For this reason, this future scenario once popularly called "[[Heat death of the universe|heat death]]" is now known as the '''Big Chill''' or '''Big Freeze'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html WMAP – Fate of the Universe], ''WMAP's Universe'', [[NASA]]. Accessed online July 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As existing stars run out of fuel and cease to shine, the universe will slowly and inexorably grow darker, one star at a time.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = Fred C. | last2 = Laughlin | first2 = Gregory | year = 1997 | title = A dying universe: the long-term fate and evolution of astrophysical objects | url = | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 69 | issue = 2| pages = 337–372 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337 | bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A | arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dying-IIE&gt;Adams &amp; Laughlin (1997), §IIE.&lt;/ref&gt; According to theories that predict [[proton decay]], the [[compact star|stellar remnants]] left behind will disappear, leaving behind only [[black hole]]s, which themselves eventually disappear as they emit [[Hawking radiation]].&lt;ref name=dying-IV&gt;Adams &amp; Laughlin (1997), §IV.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, if the universe reaches a state in which the temperature approaches a uniform value, no further [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] will be possible, resulting in a final heat death of the universe.&lt;ref name=dying-VID&gt;Adams &amp; Laughlin (1997), §VID&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cosmology==
Infinite expansion does not determine the [[Shape of the universe|overall spatial curvature of the universe]].  It can be open (with negative spatial curvature), flat, or closed (positive spatial curvature), although if it is closed, sufficient [[dark energy]] must be present to counteract the gravitational forces. Open and flat universes will expand forever even in the absence of dark energy.&lt;ref name=calibrating&gt;Chapter 7, ''Calibrating the Cosmos'', Frank Levin, New York: Springer, 2006, {{ISBN|0-387-30778-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Observations of the [[cosmic background radiation]] by the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] and the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck mission]] suggest that the universe is spatially flat and has a significant amount of [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name=wmap_5yr&gt;[http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr3/pub_papers/fiveyear/basic_results/wmap5basic.pdf Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results], G. Hinshaw et al., ''The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series'' (2008), submitted, {{arxiv|0803.0732}}, {{bibcode|2008arXiv0803.0732H}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=planck2015XIII&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1502.01589 Planck 2015 results. XIII. Cosmological parameters {{arxiv|1502.01589}}]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, the universe should continue to expand at an accelerating rate.  The acceleration of the universe's expansion has also been confirmed by observations of distant [[supernovae]].&lt;ref name=calibrating /&gt;  If, as in the [[Lambda-CDM model|concordance model]] of [[physical cosmology]] (Lambda-cold dark matter or ΛCDM), dark energy is in the form of a [[cosmological constant]], the expansion will eventually become exponential, with the size of the universe doubling at a constant rate.

If the theory of [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] is true, the universe went through an episode dominated by a different form of dark energy in the first moments of the Big Bang; but inflation ended, indicating an equation of state much more complicated than those assumed so far for present-day dark energy. It is possible that the dark energy equation of state could change again resulting in an event that would have consequences which are extremely difficult to parametrize or predict.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Future history==
In the 1970s, the future of an expanding universe was studied by the astrophysicist [[Jamal Nazrul Islam|Jamal Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;Possible Ultimate Fate of the Universe, Jamal N. Islam, ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'' '''18''' (March 1977), pp. 3–8, {{bibcode|1977QJRAS..18....3I}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the physicist [[Freeman Dyson]].&lt;ref name=twoe&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = Freeman J. | year = 1979 | title = Time without end: Physics and biology in an open universe | url = | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 447–460 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447 | bibcode=1979RvMP...51..447D}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Then, in their 1999 book [[The Five Ages of the Universe]], the astrophysicists [[Fred Adams]] and Gregory Laughlin divided the past and future history of an expanding universe into five eras.  The first, the ''Primordial Era'', is the time in the past just after the [[Big Bang]] when [[star]]s had not yet formed.  The second, the ''Stelliferous Era'', includes the present day and all of the stars and [[galaxies]] now seen.  It is the time during which stars form from [[Molecular cloud|collapsing clouds of gas]].  In the subsequent ''Degenerate Era'', the stars will have burnt out, leaving all stellar-mass objects as [[compact star|stellar remnants]]—[[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron stars]], and [[black hole]]s.  In the ''Black Hole Era'', white dwarfs, neutron stars, and other smaller [[astronomical objects]] have been destroyed by [[proton decay]], leaving only black holes.  Finally, in the ''Dark Era'', even black holes have disappeared, leaving only a dilute gas of [[photons]] and [[leptons]].&lt;ref name=fiveages /&gt;

This future history and the timeline below assume the continued expansion of the universe. If space in the universe begins to contract, subsequent events in the timeline may not occur because the [[Big Crunch]], the collapse of the universe
into a hot, dense state similar to that after the Big Bang, will supervene.&lt;ref name=fiveages /&gt;&lt;ref name=dying-VA&gt;Adams &amp; Laughlin (1997), §VA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stelliferous Era===
:''From the present to about 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; (100 trillion) years after the Big Bang''
{{See also|Graphical timeline of the Stelliferous Era}}
The observable universe is currently 1.38×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; (13.8&amp;nbsp;billion) years old.&lt;ref name='planck_cosmological_parameters'&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv=1303.5076 | title=Planck 2013 results.

About 155 million years after the Big Bang, the first star formed.  Since then, stars have formed by the collapse of small, dense core regions in large, cold [[molecular cloud]]s of [[hydrogen]] gas.  At first, this produces a [[protostar]], which is hot and bright because of energy generated by [[gravitational contraction]].  After the protostar contracts for a while, its center will become hot enough to [[nuclear fusion|fuse]] hydrogen and its lifetime as a star will properly begin.&lt;ref name=fiveages /&gt;

Stars of very low mass will eventually exhaust all their fusible [[hydrogen]] and then become [[helium]] [[white dwarf]]s.&lt;ref name=endms&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laughlin | first1 = Gregory | last2 = Bodenheimer | first2 = Peter | last3 = Adams | first3 = Fred C. | year = 1997 | title = The End of the Main Sequence | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 482 | issue = | pages = 420–432 | doi = 10.1086/304125 | bibcode=1997ApJ...482..420L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stars of low to medium mass, such as our own [[Sun#after core hydrogen exhaustion|sun]], will expel some of their mass as a [[planetary nebula]] and eventually become [[white dwarfs]]; more massive stars will explode in a [[core-collapse supernova]], leaving behind [[neutron star]]s or [[stellar-mass black hole|black holes]].&lt;ref name="evo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heger | first1 = A. | last2 = Fryer | first2 = C.

Therefore, the supply of gas available for [[star formation]] is steadily being exhausted.

====Milky Way Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy merge into one====
:''4–8 billion years from now (17.7&amp;nbsp;– 21.7 billion years after the Big Bang)''
{{main|Andromeda–Milky Way collision}}

The [[Andromeda Galaxy]] is currently approximately 2.5 million light years away from our galaxy, the [[Milky Way Galaxy]], and they are moving towards each other at approximately 300 kilometers (186 miles) per second. Approximately five billion years from now, or 19 billion years after the Big Bang, the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy will collide with one another and merge into one large galaxy based on current evidence. Up until 2012, there was no way to know whether the possible collision was definitely going to happen or not.&lt;ref name=vanderMarel2012&gt;{{cite journal|title=The M31 Velocity Vector. III.

====Coalescence of Local Group and galaxies outside the Local Supercluster are no longer accessible====
:''10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; (100 billion) to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (1 trillion) years''

The [[galaxies]] in the [[Local Group]], the cluster of galaxies which includes the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy, are gravitationally bound to each other. It is expected that between 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; (100 billion) and 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (1 trillion) years from now, their orbits will decay and the entire Local Group will merge into one large galaxy.&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;

Assuming that [[dark energy]] continues to make the universe expand at an accelerating rate, in about 150 billion years all galaxies outside the [[Local Supercluster]] will pass behind the [[cosmological horizon]]. It will then be impossible for events in the Local Group to affect other galaxies. Similarly it will be impossible for events after 150 billion years, as seen by observers in distant galaxies, to affect events in the Local Group.&lt;ref name=lun /&gt; However, an observer in the Local Supercluster will continue to see distant galaxies, but events they observe will become exponentially more [[Gravitational time dilation|time dilated]] (and [[Gravitational redshift|red shifted]]&lt;ref name=lun /&gt;) as the galaxy approaches the horizon until time in the distant galaxy seems to stop. The observer in the Local Supercluster never actually sees the distant galaxy pass beyond the horizon and never observes events after 150 billion years in their local time. Therefore, after 150 billion years intergalactic transportation and communication beyond the Local Supercluster becomes causally impossible.

====Luminosities of galaxies begin to diminish====
:''8×10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; (800 billion) years''

8×10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; (800 billion) years from now, the luminosities of the different galaxies, approximately similar until then to the current ones thanks to the increasing luminosity of the remaining stars as they age, will start to decrease, as the less massive red dwarf stars begin to die as [[black dwarf]]s.&lt;ref name="bluedwarf"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Galaxies outside the Local Supercluster are no longer detectable====
:''2×10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (2 trillion) years''

2×10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (2 trillion) years from now, all galaxies outside the [[Virgo Supercluster|Local Supercluster]] will be [[red-shift]]ed to such an extent that even [[gamma ray]]s they emit will have wavelengths longer than the size of the [[observable universe]] of the time. Therefore, these galaxies will no longer be detectable in any way.&lt;ref name=lun&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krauss | first1 = Lawrence M. | last2 = Starkman | first2 = Glenn D. | year = 2000 | title = Life, the Universe, and Nothing: Life and Death in an Ever-expanding Universe | url = | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 531 | issue = | pages = 22–30 | doi = 10.1086/308434 | bibcode=2000ApJ...531...22K|arxiv = astro-ph/9902189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degenerate Era===
:''From 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; (100 trillion) to 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; (10 duodecillion) years''

By 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; (100 trillion) years from now, star formation will end,&lt;ref name=dying /&gt; leaving all stellar objects in the form of [[compact star|degenerate remnants]]. If [[proton decay|protons do not decay]], stellar-mass objects will disappear more slowly, making this era [[Future of an expanding universe#Future without proton decay|last longer]].

====Star formation ceases====
:''10&lt;sup&gt;12-14&lt;/sup&gt; (1-100 trillion) years''

By 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; (100 trillion) years from now, star formation will end. This period, known as the Degenerate Era, will last until the degenerate remnants finally decay.&lt;ref&gt;Adams &amp; Laughlin (1997), §&amp;nbsp;III–IV.&lt;/ref&gt; The least massive stars take the longest to exhaust their hydrogen fuel (see [[stellar evolution]]). Thus, the longest living stars in the universe are low-mass [[red dwarf]]s, with a mass of about 0.08 [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=y}}), which have a lifetime of order 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; (10 trillion) years.&lt;ref name=low_mass_lifetime&gt;Adams &amp; Laughlin (1997), §IIA and Figure&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, this is comparable to the length of time over which star formation takes place.&lt;ref name=dying /&gt; Once star formation ends and the least massive red dwarfs exhaust their fuel, [[nuclear fusion]] will cease. The low-mass red dwarfs will cool and become [[black dwarf]]s.&lt;ref name=endms /&gt; The only objects remaining with more than [[planemo|planetary mass]] will be [[brown dwarf]]s, with mass less than {{Solar mass|0.08}}, and [[compact star|degenerate remnants]]; [[white dwarf]]s, produced by stars with initial masses between about 0.08 and 8 solar masses; and [[neutron star]]s and [[stellar black hole|black holes]], produced by stars with initial masses over {{Solar mass|8}}. Most of the mass of this collection, approximately 90%, will be in the form of white dwarfs.&lt;ref name=dying-IIE /&gt; In the absence of any energy source, all of these formerly luminous bodies will cool and become faint.

The universe will become extremely dark after the last star burns out. Even so, there can still be occasional light in the universe. One of the ways the universe can be illuminated is if two [[carbon]]–[[oxygen]] white dwarfs with a combined mass of more than the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] of about 1.4 solar masses happen to merge. The resulting object will then undergo runaway thermonuclear fusion, producing a [[Type Ia supernova]] and dispelling the darkness of the Degenerate Era for a few weeks.&lt;ref name=dying-IIIC&gt;Adams &amp; Laughlin (1997), §IIIC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys240/lectures/future/future.html The Future of the Universe], M. Richmond, lecture notes, "Physics 240", [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]. Accessed on line July 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; If the combined mass is not above the Chandrasekhar limit but is larger than the minimum mass to [[nuclear fusion|fuse]] carbon (about {{Solar mass|0.9}}), a [[carbon star]] could be produced, with a lifetime of around 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; (1 million) years.&lt;ref name=fiveages /&gt; Also, if two helium white dwarfs with a combined mass of at least {{Solar mass|0.3}} collide, a [[helium star]] may be produced, with a lifetime of a few hundred million years.&lt;ref name=fiveages /&gt; Finally brown dwarfs can form new stars colliding with each other to form a [[red dwarf]] star, that can survive for 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; (10 trillion) years,&lt;ref name=low_mass_lifetime /&gt;&lt;ref name=dying-IIIC/&gt; or accreting gas at very slow rates from the remaining [[interstellar medium]] until they have enough mass to start [[hydrogen burning]] as red dwarfs too. This process, at least on white dwarfs, could induce Type Ia supernovae too.&lt;ref name=browndwarf&gt;Brown Dwarf Accretion: Nonconventional Star Formation over Very Long Timescales,  Cirkovic, M. M., ''Serbian Astronomical Journal'' '''171''', (December 2005), pp. 11–17.  {{bibcode|2005SerAJ.171...11C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Planets fall or are flung from orbits by a close encounter with another star====
:''10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; (1 quadrillion) years''
Over time, the [[orbit]]s of planets will decay due to [[gravitational radiation]], or planets will be ejected from their local systems by [[gravitational perturbations]] caused by encounters with another [[compact star|stellar remnant]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams &amp; Laughlin (1997), §IIIF,&amp;nbsp;Table I.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stellar remnants escape galaxies or fall into black holes====
:''10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; (10 to 100 quintillion) years''
Over time, objects in a [[galaxy]] exchange [[kinetic energy]] in a process called [[dynamical relaxation]], making their velocity distribution approach the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 428, A deep focus on NGC 1883, A. L. Tadross, ''Bulletin of the Astronomical Society of India'' '''33''', #4 (December 2005), pp. 421–431, {{bibcode|2005BASI...33..421T}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamical relaxation can proceed either by close encounters of two stars or by less violent but more frequent distant encounters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webusers.astro.umn.edu/~llrw/a4002/SG_notes.txt Reading notes], Liliya L. R. Williams, Astrophysics II: Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy, [[University of Minnesota]], accessed on line July 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a close encounter, two [[brown dwarfs]] or [[compact star|stellar remnants]] will pass close to each other. When this happens, the trajectories of the objects involved in the close encounter change slightly, in such a way that their [[kinetic energy|kinetic energies]] are more nearly equal than before. After a large number of encounters, then, lighter objects tend to gain speed while the heavier objects lose it.&lt;ref name=fiveages&gt;''[[The Five Ages of the Universe]]'', Fred Adams and Greg Laughlin, New York: The Free Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-684-85422-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of dynamical relaxation, some objects will gain enough energy to reach galactic [[escape velocity]] and depart the galaxy, leaving behind a smaller, denser galaxy. Since encounters are more frequent in the denser galaxy, the process then accelerates. The end result is that most objects (90% to 99%) are ejected from the galaxy, leaving a small fraction (maybe 1% to 10%) which fall into the central [[supermassive black hole]].&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;&lt;ref name=fiveages /&gt; It has been suggested that the matter of the fallen remnants will form an [[accretion disk]] around it that will create a [[quasar]], as long as enough matter is present there.&lt;ref name=deeptime&gt;''Deep Time'', [[David J. Darling]], New York: Delacorte Press, 1989, {{ISBN|978-0-38529-757-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nucleons start to decay====
:{{See also|Nucleon}}''Chance: 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; (10 decillion) &lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; years (1 duodecillion)''
The subsequent evolution of the universe depends on the possibility and rate of [[proton decay]]. Experimental evidence shows that if the [[proton]] is unstable, it has a [[half-life]] of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; years.&lt;ref&gt;G Senjanovic ''Proton decay and grand unification'', Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the [[Grand Unified Theory|Grand Unified theories]] (GUTs) predict long-term proton instability between 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; years, with the upper bound on standard (non-supersymmetry) proton decay at 1.4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; years and an overall upper limit maximum for any proton decay (including [[supersymmetry]] models) at 6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; years.&lt;ref&gt;"Upper Bound on the Proton Lifetime and the Minimal Non-SUSY Grand Unified Theory", Pavel Fileviez Perez, Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, June 2006. {{doi|10.1063/1.2735205}} https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2020161_Upper_Bound_on_the_Proton_Lifetime_and_the_Minimal_Non-SUSY_Grand_Unified_Theory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pran Nath and Pavel Fileviez Perez, "Proton Stability
in Grand Unified Theories, in Strings and in Branes", Appendix H; 23 April 2007.  arXiv:hep-ph/0601023  https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0601023&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research showing proton lifetime (if unstable) at or exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; year range rules out simpler GUTs and most non-supersymmetry models.

[[Neutron]]s bound into [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] are also expected to decay with a half-life comparable to that of protons. Planets (substellar objects) would decay in a simple cascade process from heavier elements to pure hydrogen while radiating energy.&lt;ref name="dying-IVH"&gt;Adams &amp; Laughlin (1997), §IV-H.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event that the proton does not decay at all, stellar objects would still disappear, but more slowly. See [[#Future without proton decay|Future without proton decay]] below.

Shorter or longer proton half-lives will accelerate or decelerate the process. This means that after 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; years (the maximum proton half-life used by Adams &amp; Laughlin (1997)), one-half of all baryonic matter will have been converted into [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s and [[leptons]] through proton decay.

====All nucleons decay====
:''10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; (10 duodecillion) years''

Given our assumed half-life of the proton, [[nucleon]]s (protons and bound neutrons) will have undergone roughly 1,000 half-lives by the time the universe is 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; years old.  To put this into perspective, there are an estimated 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; protons currently in the  universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/jhp/oneuniverse/frontiers_solution_17.html Solution, exercise 17], ''One Universe: At Home in the Cosmos'', Neil de Grasse Tyson, Charles Tsun-Chu Liu, and Robert Irion, Washington, D.C.: Joseph Henry Press, 2000.  {{ISBN|0-309-06488-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that the number of nucleons will be slashed in half 1,000 times by the time the universe is 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; years old. Hence, there will be roughly ½&lt;sup&gt;1,000&lt;/sup&gt; (approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−301&lt;/sup&gt;) as many nucleons remaining as there are today; that is, ''zero'' nucleons remaining in the universe at the end of the Degenerate Age. Effectively, all baryonic matter will have been changed into [[photon]]s and [[lepton]]s. Some models predict the formation of stable [[positronium]] atoms with a greater diameter than the observable universe's current diameter in 10&lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt; years, and that these will in turn decay to gamma radiation in 10&lt;sup&gt;141&lt;/sup&gt; years.&lt;ref name="dying" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dying-IIE" /&gt;

[[File:BlackHole.jpg|thumb|right|245px|The [[supermassive black hole]]s are all that remain of galaxies once all protons decay, but even these giants are not immortal.]]

====If protons decay on higher order nuclear processes====
:''Chance: 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; years to 10&lt;sup&gt;200&lt;/sup&gt; years''
In the event that the proton does not decay according to the theories described above, the Degenerate Era will last longer, and will overlap or surpass the Black Hole Era.  However, degenerate stellar objects can still experience proton decay, for example via processes involving the [[Chiral anomaly|Adler–Bell–Jackiw anomaly]], [[virtual black hole]]s, or higher-dimension [[supersymmetry]] possibly with a half-life of under 10&lt;sup&gt;200&lt;/sup&gt; years.&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;

[[File:Photon waves.png|thumb|right|245px|The [[photon]] is now the last remnant of the universe as the last of the [[supermassive black hole]]s evaporates.]]

===Black Hole Era===
:''10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; (10 duodecillion) years to approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; (1 [[googol]]) years, up to 10&lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt; years for the largest supermassive black holes ''

After 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years, black holes will dominate the universe. They will slowly evaporate via [[Hawking radiation]].&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;A black hole with a mass of around {{Solar mass|1}} will vanish in around 2×10&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt; years. As the lifetime of a black hole is proportional to the cube of its mass, more massive black holes take longer to decay.  A supermassive black hole with a mass of 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; (100 billion) {{Solar mass|}} will evaporate in around 2×10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; years.&lt;ref name=page&gt;Particle emission rates from a black hole: Massless particles from an uncharged, nonrotating hole, Don N. Page, ''Physical Review D'' '''13''' (1976), pp. 198–206.  {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevD.13.198}}. See in particular equation (27).&lt;/ref&gt;

The monster black holes in the universe are predicted to continue to grow. Larger black holes of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; (100 trillion) {{solar mass}} may form during the collapse of superclusters of galaxies. Even these would evaporate over a timescale of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt; years&lt;ref&gt;Frautschi, S., 1982. Entropy in an expanding universe. Science, 217(4560), pp.593-599. See page 596: table 1 and section "black hole decay" and previous sentence on that page
{{quote|"Since we have assumed a maximum scale of gravitational binding - for instance, superclusters of galaxies - black hole formation eventually comes to an end in our model, with masses of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;{{solar mass}} ... the timescale for black holes to radiate away all their energy ranges ... to 10&lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt; years for black holes of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;{{solar mass}}"}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Hawking radiation has a [[thermal radiation|thermal spectrum]].  During most of a black hole's lifetime, the radiation has a low temperature and is mainly in the form of massless particles such as [[photon]]s and hypothetical [[graviton]]s. As the black hole's mass decreases, its temperature increases, becoming comparable to the [[Sun]]'s by the time the black hole mass has decreased to 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; kilograms.  The hole then provides a temporary source of light during the general darkness of the Black Hole Era. During the last stages of its evaporation, a black hole will emit not only massless particles, but also heavier particles, such as [[electron]]s, [[positron]]s, [[proton]]s, and [[antiproton]]s.&lt;ref name=fiveages /&gt;

{{Anchor|Dark Era}}

===Dark Era and Photon Age===
:''From 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; years (10 duotrigintillion years or 1 googol years)''

After all the black holes have evaporated (and after all the ordinary matter made of protons has disintegrated, if protons are unstable), the universe will be nearly empty. Photons, neutrinos, electrons, and positrons will fly from place to place, hardly ever encountering each other. Gravitationally, the universe will be dominated by [[dark matter]], electrons, and positrons (not protons).&lt;ref name=dying-VD&gt;Adams &amp; Laughlin (1997), §VD.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this era, with only very diffuse matter remaining, activity in the universe will have tailed off dramatically (compared with previous eras), with very low energy levels and very large time scales. Electrons and positrons drifting through space will encounter one another and occasionally form [[positronium]] atoms. These structures are unstable, however, and their constituent particles must eventually annihilate.&lt;ref name=dying-VF3&gt;Adams &amp; Laughlin (1997), §VF3.&lt;/ref&gt; Other low-level annihilation events will also take place, albeit very slowly. The universe now reaches an extremely low-energy state.

===Beyond===
:''Beyond 10&lt;sup&gt;2500&lt;/sup&gt; years''
{{See also|Ultimate fate of the universe}}

What happens beyond 10&lt;sup&gt;2500&lt;/sup&gt; years is speculative. It is possible that a [[Big Rip]] event may occur far off into the future.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, Robert R.; Kamionkowski, Marc; and Weinberg, Nevin N. (2003). {{cite news | title = Phantom energy and cosmic doomsday | arxiv = astro-ph/0302506|bibcode = 2003PhRvL..91g1301C |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.071301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bohmadi-Lopez, Mariam; Gonzalez-Diaz, Pedro F.; and Martin-Moruno, Prado (2008). {{cite news | title = Worse than a big rip? | arxiv = gr-qc/0612135|bibcode = 2008PhLB..659....1B |doi = 10.1016/j.physletb.2007.10.079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This singularity would take place at a finite scale factor.

If the current [[vacuum state]] is a [[false vacuum]], the vacuum may decay into a lower-energy state.&lt;ref name=dying-VE&gt;Adams &amp; Laughlin (1997), §VE.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presumably, extreme low-energy states imply that localized quantum events become major macroscopic phenomena rather than negligible microscopic events because the smallest perturbations make the biggest difference in this era, so there is no telling what may happen to space or time. It is perceived that the laws of "macro-physics" will break down, and the laws of "quantum-physics" will prevail.&lt;ref name=dying-VID/&gt;

The universe could possibly avoid eternal heat death through random [[quantum tunnelling]] and [[quantum fluctuation]]s, given the non-zero probability of producing a new Big Bang in roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; years.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Sean M. and Chen, Jennifer (2004). {{cite news | title = Spontaneous Inflation and Origin of the Arrow of Time | arxiv = hep-th/0410270|bibcode = 2004hep.th...10270C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over an infinite time there could be a spontaneous [[entropy]] decrease, by a [[Poincaré recurrence theorem|Poincaré recurrence]] or through [[thermal fluctuations]] (see also [[fluctuation theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark, Max (2003) {{cite news | title = Parallel Universes | arxiv = astro-ph/0302131|bibcode = 2003SciAm.288e..40T |doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0503-40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werlang, T., Ribeiro, G. A. P. and Rigolin, Gustavo (2012) {{ cite news | title = Interplay between quantum phase transitions and the behavior of quantum correlations at finite temperatures | arxiv = 1205.1046|bibcode = 2012IJMPB..2745032W |doi = 10.1142/S021797921345032X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xing, Xiu-San (2007) {{ cite news | title = Spontaneous entropy decrease and its statistical formula | arxiv = 0710.4624|bibcode = 2007arXiv0710.4624X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linde, Andrei (2007) {{ cite news | title = Sinks in the Landscape, Boltzmann Brains, and the Cosmological Constant Problem | arxiv = hep-th/0611043|bibcode = 2007JCAP...01..022L |doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2007/01/022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibilities above are based on a simple form of [[dark energy]]. But the physics of dark energy are still a very active area of research, and the actual form of dark energy could be much more complex.  For example, during [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] dark energy affected the universe very differently than it does today, so it's possible that dark energy could trigger another inflationary period in the future. Until dark energy is better understood its possible effects are extremely difficult to predict or parametrize.

==Future without proton decay==
If the protons do not decay, stellar-mass objects will still become [[black hole]]s, but more slowly.  The following timeline assumes that [[proton decay]] does not take place.

===Degenerate Era===
====Possible ionization of matter====
:''&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; years from now''
In an expanding universe with decreasing density and nonzero cosmological constant, matter density would reach zero, resulting in all matter including stellar objects and planets ionizing and dissipating at thermal equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;[[John C. Baez|John Baez]], University of California-Riverside (Department of Mathematics), "The End of the Universe" 7 Feb 2016 http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/end.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sphaleron transitions and possible baryon violation====
:''&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt; years from now''

Although protons are stable in standard model physics, a [[chiral anomaly|quantum anomaly]] may exist on the electroweak level, which can cause groups of baryons (protons and neutrons) to annihilate into antileptons via the [[sphaleron]] transition.&lt;ref&gt;G. ’t Hooft, "Symmetry breaking through Bell-Jackiw anomalies". Phys. Rev. Lett. 37 (1976) 8&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[baryon number|baryon/lepton violations]] have a number of 3 and can only occur in multiples or groups of three baryons, which can restrict or prohibit such events. No experimental evidence of sphalerons has yet been observed at low energy levels, though they are believed to occur regularly at high energies and temperatures.

====Matter decays into iron====
:''10&lt;sup&gt;1500&lt;/sup&gt; years from now''

In 10&lt;sup&gt;1500&lt;/sup&gt; years, [[Muon-catalyzed fusion|cold fusion]] occurring via [[quantum tunnelling]] should make the light [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in ordinary matter fuse into [[iron-56]] nuclei (see [[isotopes of iron]]). [[Nuclear fission|Fission]] and [[alpha particle]] emission should make heavy nuclei also decay to iron, leaving stellar-mass objects as cold spheres of iron, called [[iron star]]s.&lt;ref name=twoe /&gt;

===Black Hole Era===
====Collapse of iron star to black hole====
:''10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;76&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; years from now''

Quantum tunnelling should also turn large objects into [[black hole]]s.  Depending on the assumptions made, the time this takes to happen can be calculated as from 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; years to 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;76&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; years. Quantum tunnelling may also make iron stars collapse into [[neutron star]]s in around 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;76&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; years.&lt;ref name=twoe /&gt;

'''Glassblowing''' is a glassforming technique that involves inflating molten [[glass]] into a bubble (or parison) with the aid of a [[Blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]] (or blow tube). A person who blows glass is called a '''glassblower''', '''glassmith''', or '''gaffer'''. A '''[[lampworking|lampworker]]''' (often also called a glassblower or glassworker) manipulates glass with the use of a torch on a smaller scale, such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of [[borosilicate glass]].

==Technology==

===Principles===
As a novel glass forming technique created in the middle of the [[1st century BC]], glassblowing exploited a working property of glass that was previously unknown to glassworkers; inflation, which is the expansion of a molten blob of glass by introducing a small amount of air to it. That is based on the liquid structure of glass where the atoms are held together by strong chemical bonds in a disordered and random network,&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;Frank, S 1982. Glass and Archaeology. Academic Press: London. {{ISBN|0-12-265620-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freestone"&gt;Freestone, I. (1991). "Looking into Glass". In S. Bowman (ed.) ''Science and the Past''. pp.37–56. University of Toronto Press: Toronto &amp; Buffalo. {{ISBN|0-7141-2071-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pollard"&gt;Pollard, A.M. and C. Heron 2008. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CT_FWEfanCIC&amp;printsec=frontcover Archaeological Chemistry]. The Royal Society of Chemistry {{ISBN|0-85404-262-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore molten glass is viscous enough to be blown and gradually hardens as it loses heat.&lt;ref name="Cummings"&gt;Cummings, K. 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nm387Ui_DEAC&amp;printsec=frontcover A History of Glassforming]. University of Pennsylvania Press {{ISBN|0812236475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase the stiffness of the molten glass, which in turn facilitates the process of blowing, there was a subtle change in the composition of glass. With reference to their studies of the ancient glass assemblages from [[Sepphoris]] of Israel, Fischer and McCray&lt;ref name="Fischer"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/jasc.1999.0398|title=Glass Production Activities as Practiced at Sepphoris, Israel (37 ?–? 1516)|year=1999|last1=Fischer|first1=A|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=26|pages=893|issue=8|last2=McGray|first2=W.Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulated that the concentration of [[natron]], which acts as [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in glass, is slightly lower in blown vessels than those manufactured by casting. Lower concentration of natron would have allowed the glass to be stiffer for blowing.

During blowing, thinner layers of glass cool faster than thicker ones and become more viscous than the thicker layers. That allows production of blown glass with uniform thickness instead of causing blow-through of the thinned layers.

A full range of glassblowing techniques was developed within decades of its invention.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The two major methods of glassblowing are free-blowing and mold-blowing.

====Free-blowing====
[[File:Glassblowing demo at Norcal Ren Faire 2010-09-19 20.JPG|alt=Glassblowing demo at North California Renaissance Fair in 2010|thumb|Glassblowing demo at North California Renaissance Fair in 2010]]
This method held a pre-eminent position in glassforming ever since its introduction in the middle of the 1st century BC until the late 19th century, and is still widely used nowadays as a glassforming technique, especially for artistic purposes. The process of free-blowing involves the blowing of short puffs of air into a molten portion of glass called a '"gather" which has been spooled at one end of the blowpipe. This has the effect of forming an elastic skin on the interior of the glass blob that matches the exterior skin caused by the removal of heat from the furnace. The glassworker can then quickly inflate the molten glass to a coherent blob and work it into a desired shape.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mariacher"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mariacher|first1=G|title=Glass: from Antiquity to the Renaissance|date=1970|publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=Middlesex}} (apparently out of print)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zerwick"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chloe Zerwick|author2=Corning Museum of Glass|title=A short history of glass|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1ZQAAAAMAAJ|date=May 1990|publisher=H.N. Abrams in association with the Corning Museum of Glass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the Toledo Museum of Art attempted to reconstruct the ancient free-blowing technique by using clay blowpipes. The result proved that short clay blowpipes of about {{convert|30|–|60|cm|abbr=on}} facilitate free-blowing because they are simple to handle and to manipulate and can be re-used several times.&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Birgit Schlick-Nolte|author2=E. Marianne|title=Early glass of the ancient world: 1600 B.C.-A.D. 50 : Ernesto Wolf collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dJUsAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=clay+blowpipe|year=1994|publisher=[[Gerd Hatje|Verlag Gerd Hatje]]|isbn=978-3-7757-0502-8|pages=81–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled workers are capable of shaping almost any vessel forms by rotating the pipe, swinging it and controlling the temperature of the piece while they blow. They can produce a great variety of glass objects, ranging from drinking cups to window glass.

An outstanding example of the free-blowing technique is the [[Portland Vase]], which is a cameo manufactured during the Roman period. An experiment was carried out by Gudenrath and Whitehouse&lt;ref name="Gudnerath"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gudenrath |first1=W. |last2=Whitehouse |first2=D. |year=1990 |title= The Manufacture of the Vase of its Ancient Repair |journal=Journal of Glass Studies |volume= 32 |pages= 108–121 |jstor=24188035}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of re-creating the Portland Vase. A full amount of blue glass required for the body of the vase was gathered on the end of the blowpipe and was subsequently dipped into a pot of hot white glass. Inflation occurred when the glassworker blew the molten glass into a sphere which was then stretched or elongated into a vase with a layer of white glass overlying the blue body.

====Mold-blowing====
[[File:Bamboo Framing.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Glassblower [[Jean-Pierre Canlis]] sculpting a section of his piece "Insignificance"]]
Mold-blowing was an alternative glassblowing method that came after the invention of free-blowing, during the first part of the second quarter of the [[1st century AD]].&lt;ref name="Lightfoot"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lightfoot, C.S.|year= 1987|title= A Group of early Roman Mould-Blown Flasks from the West|journal= Journal of Glass Studies |volume=29|pages= 11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pricea"&gt;Price, J. (1991). "Decorated Mould-Blown Glass Tablewares in the First century AD". In M. Newby &amp; K. Painter (eds.) ''Roman Glass: Two Centuries of Art and Invention''. pp. 56–75. The Society of Antiquaries of London: London {{ISBN|0-85431-255-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A glob of molten glass is placed on the end of the blowpipe, and is then inflated into a wooden or metal carved mold. In that way, the shape and the texture of the bubble of glass is determined by the design on the interior of the mold rather than the skill of the glassworker.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;

Two types of molds, namely single-piece mold and multi-piece mold, are frequently used to produce mold-blown vessels. The former allows the finished glass object to be removed in one movement by pulling it upwards from the single-piece mold and is largely employed to produce tableware and utilitarian vessels for storage and transportation.&lt;ref name="Tattona"&gt;Tatton-Brown, V. (1991). "The Roman Empire". In H. Tait (ed.) ''Five Thousand Years of Glass''. pp. 62–97. British Museum Press: London {{ISBN|0-8122-1888-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the latter is made in multi-paneled mold segments that join together, thus permitting the development of more sophisticated surface modeling, texture and design.

The Roman leaf beaker which is now on display in the J. Paul Getty Museum was blown in a three-part mold decorated with the foliage relief frieze of four vertical plants.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wright, K.|year= 2000|title= Leaf Beakers and Roman Mould-blown Glass Production in the First Century AD|journal=Journal of Glass Studies |volume=42|pages= 61–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Taylor and Hill&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, M. &amp; D. Hill 1998. Making Roman Glass Today. In The Colchester Archaeologist 11&lt;/ref&gt; tried to reproduce mold-blown vessels by using three-part molds made of different materials. The result suggested that metal, in particular bronze, molds are more effective in producing high-relief design on glass than plaster molds and wooden molds.

The development of the mold-blowing technique has enabled the speedy production of glass objects in large quantity, thus encouraging the mass production and widespread distribution of glass objects.&lt;ref name="Pricea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cuneaz"&gt;Cuneaz, G. (2003). "Introduction". In R.B. Mentasti, R. Mollo, P. Framarin, M. Sciaccaluga &amp; A. Geotti (eds.)

The transformation of raw materials into glass takes place around {{convert|2400|°F|°C|abbr=on|order=flip}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NJBAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=glass+at+2,400+%C2%BAF+white+hot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Jp2zDacTFp&amp;sig=_YDd_WvTydE_gY9mNTl3EatB8Mk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu57OEj_DTAhVL4mMKHRsVDL4Q6AEIQzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=glass%20at%202,400%20%C2%BAF%20white%20hot&amp;f=false|title=Purchasing Agent: Magazine of Centralized Buying|date=1919-01-01|publisher=Purchasing agent Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the glass emits enough heat to appear almost white hot. The glass is then left to "fine out" (allowing the [[liquid bubble|bubbles]] to rise out of the mass), and then the working temperature is reduced in the furnace to around {{convert|2000|°F|°C|abbr=on|order=flip}}. At this stage, the glass appears to be a bright orange color. Though most glassblowing is done between {{convert|1600|and|1900|°F|°C|order=flip}}, "soda-lime" glass remains somewhat plastic and workable as low as {{convert|1350|°F|°C|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Annealing is usually done between {{convert|700|and|900|°F|°C|order=flip}}.

{{anchor|glory hole|lehr|annealer}}
Glassblowing involves three [[furnace]]s. The first, which contains a [[crucible]] of molten glass, is simply referred to as '''the furnace'''. The second is called the '''glory hole''', and is used to reheat a piece in between steps of working with it. The final furnace is called the '''lehr''' or '''annealer''', and is used to slowly cool the glass, over a period of a few hours to a few days, depending on the size of the pieces. This keeps the glass from cracking or shattering due to [[thermal stress]]. Historically, all three furnaces were contained in one structure, with a set of progressively cooler chambers for each of the three purposes.

{{anchor|punty|pontil|blowpipe|marver}}
The major tools used by a glassblower are the blowpipe (or blow tube), punty (or punty rod, pontil, or mandrel), bench, marver, blocks, jacks, paddles, tweezers, newspaper pads, and a variety of shears.

The tip of the '''[[blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]]''' is first preheated; then dipped in the molten glass in the furnace. The molten glass is "gathered" onto the end of the blowpipe in much the same way that viscous [[honey]] is picked up on a [[honey dipper]]. This glass is then rolled on the '''[[marver]]''', which was traditionally a flat slab of [[marble]], but today is more commonly a fairly thick flat sheet of [[steel]]. This process, called marvering,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100118153111/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/269.html Marvering]. glassonline.com&lt;/ref&gt; forms a cool skin on the exterior of the molten glass blob, and shapes it. Then air is blown into the pipe, creating a bubble. Next, the glassworker can gather more glass over that bubble to create a larger piece. Once a piece has been blown to its approximate final size, the bottom is finalized. Then, the molten glass is attached to a [[stainless steel]] or [[iron]] rod called a punty  for shaping and transferring the hollow piece from the blowpipe to provide an opening and/or to finalize the top.

The '''bench''' is a glassblower's workstation, and has a place for the glassblower to sit, a place for the handheld tools, and two rails that the pipe or punty rides on while the blower works with the piece. '''Blocks''' are ladle-like tools made from water-soaked [[fruitwood]], and are used similarly to the marver to shape and cool a piece in the early steps of creation.  In similar fashion, pads of '''water-soaked newspaper''' (roughly {{cvt|6|in|cm|order=flip}} square, {{convert|0.5|to|1|in|cm|order=flip}} thick), held in the bare hand, can be used to shape the piece.  '''Jacks''' are tools shaped somewhat like large tweezers with two blades, which are used for forming shape later in the creation of a piece. '''Paddles''' are flat pieces of wood or [[graphite]] used for creating flat spots such as a bottom. '''Tweezers''' are used to pick out details or to pull on the glass. There are two important types of shears, straight shears and diamond shears. '''Straight shears''' are essentially bulky [[scissors]], used for making linear cuts. '''Diamond shears''' have blades that form a diamond shape when partially open. These are used for cutting off masses of glass.

There are many ways to apply patterns and color to blown glass, including rolling molten glass in powdered color or larger pieces of colored glass called [[frit]]. Complex patterns with great detail can be created through the use of [[caneworking|cane]] (rods of colored glass) and [[murrine]] (rods cut in cross-sections to reveal patterns). These pieces of color can be arranged in a pattern on a flat surface, and then "picked up" by rolling a bubble of molten glass over them. One of the most exacting and complicated caneworking techniques is "reticello", which involves creating two bubbles from cane, each twisted in a different direction and then combining them and blowing out the final form.

A [[lampworking|lampworker]], usually operating on a much smaller scale, historically used [[alcohol]] lamps and breath or [[bellows]]-driven air to create a hot flame at a workbench to manipulate preformed glass rods and tubes. These stock materials took form as [[laboratory glassware]], beads, and durable scientific "specimens"—miniature glass sculpture. The craft, which was raised to an art form in the late 1960s by [[Hans Godo Frabel]] (later followed by lampwork artists such as Milon Townsend and Robert Mickelson), is still practiced today. The modern lampworker uses a flame of [[oxygen]] and [[propane]] or [[natural gas]]. The modern torch permits working both the soft glass from the furnace worker and the [[borosilicate glass]] (low-expansion) of the [[scientific glassblowing|scientific glassblower]]. This latter worker may also have multiple headed torches and special [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]]s to help form the glass or [[fused quartz]] used for special projects.

==History==

===Origins===

The earliest evidence of glassblowing was found by [[Roman Ghirshman]] in [[Chogha Zanbil]], where many glass bottles were found in the excavations of the 2nd millennium BC site.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Sève, L (2012). Ghirshman, Roman. Encyclopaedia Iranica Vol. X, Fasc. 6, pp. 583-586&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;شیشه‌گری (In Persian: Glassblowing) [[:fa:شیشه‌گری]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later evidence comes from a collection of waste from a glass shop, including fragments of glass tubes, glass rods and tiny blown bottles, which was dumped in a [[mikvah]], a ritual bath in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of [[Jerusalem]], dated from 37 to 4 BC.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Avigad"&gt;Avigad, N (1983). ''Discovering Jerusalem''. Nashville. {{ISBN|0-8407-5299-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the glass tubes recovered are fire-closed at one end and are partially inflated by blowing through the open end while still hot to form a small bottle; thus they are considered as a rudimentary form of blowpipe.&lt;ref name="Gudnerath"/&gt;

Hence, tube blowing not only represents the initial attempts of experimentation by glassworkers at blowing glass, it is also a revolutionary step that induced a change in conception and a deep understanding of glass.&lt;ref name="Israeli"&gt;Israeli, Y. (1991). "The Invention of Blowing". In M. Newby &amp; K. Painter (eds.) ''Roman Glass: Two Centuries of Art and Invention''. pp. 46–55. The Society of Antiquaries of London: London {{ISBN|0-85431-255-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such inventions swiftly eclipsed all other traditional methods, such as casting and core-forming, in working glass.

===Roman Empire===
{{Main|Roman glass}}

[[File:Glassworking and glassblowing.jpg|thumb|upright|Glassblowing production methods in England in 1858]]

The invention of glassblowing coincided with the establishment of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 1st century BC, which enhanced the spread and dominance of this new technology.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vosea"&gt;Vose, R.H. (1989). ''Glass''. Collins Archaeology: London. {{ISBN|0-85223-714-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glassblowing was greatly supported by the Roman government (although Roman citizens could not be "in trade", in particular under the reign of [[Augustus]]), and glass was being blown in many areas of the Roman world.&lt;ref name="Pricea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Isings"&gt;Isings, C. 1957. Roman Glass: from dated finds. Archaeologica Traiectina. J.B. Wolters: Groningen.&lt;/ref&gt; On the eastern borders of the Empire, the first large glass workshops were set up by the [[Phoenicians]] in the birthplace of glassblowing in contemporary [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]] as well as in the neighbouring province of [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;

[[Ennion]] for example, was among one of the most prominent glassworkers from Lebanon of the time. He was renowned for producing the multi-paneled mold-blown glass vessels that were complex in their shapes, arrangement and decorative motifs.&lt;ref name="Pricea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; The complexity of designs of these mold-blown glass vessels illustrated the sophistication of the glassworkers in the eastern regions of the Roman Empire. Mold-blown glass vessels manufactured by the workshops of Ennion and other contemporary glassworkers such as Jason, Nikon, Aristeas, and Meges, constitutes some of the earliest evidence of glassblowing found in the eastern territories.&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horicht"&gt;Hőricht, L.A.S. (1991). "Syrian Elements among the Glass from Pompeii". In M. Newby &amp; K. Painter (eds.) ''Roman Glass: two centuries of art and invention''. pp. 76–85. The Society of Antiquaries of London: London {{ISBN|0-85431-255-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the glassblowing technique reached [[Egypt]] and was described in a fragmentary poem printed on [[papyrus]] which was dated to 3rd century AD.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coles"&gt;Coles, R.A. 1983. The Oxyrhynchus Papyri 50. Egypt Exploration Society for the British Academy: London.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean areas resulted in the substitution of glassblowing for earlier Hellenistic casting, core-forming and mosaic fusion techniques.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt; The earliest evidence of blowing in Hellenistic work consists of small blown bottles for perfume and oil retrieved from the glass workshops on the Greek island of [[Samothrace]] and at [[Corinth]] in mainland [[Greece]] which were dated to the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;

Later, the Phoenician glassworkers exploited their glassblowing techniques and set up their workshops in the western territories of the Roman Empire, first in [[Italy]] by the middle of the 1st century AD. [[Rome]], the heartland of the Empire, soon became a major glassblowing center, and more glassblowing workshops were subsequently established in other provinces of Italy, for example [[Campania]], [[Morgantina]] and [[Aquileia]].&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grose"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grose, D.F.|year=1982|title=The Hellenistic and Early Roman Glass from Morgantina (Serra Orlando), Sicily|journal=Journal of Glass Studies |volume=24|page=s 20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A great variety of blown glass objects, ranging from [[unguentaria]] (toiletry containers for [[perfume]]) to [[cameo (carving)|cameo]], from [[tableware]] to [[window]] glass, were produced.

From there, escaping craftsmen (who had been forbidden to travel) otherwise advanced to the rest of Europe by building their glassblowing workshops in the north of the [[Alps]] (which is now [[Switzerland]]), and then at sites in northern Europe in present-day [[France]] and [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="Vosea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;Allen, D. (1998). "Roman Glass in Britain". ''Shire Archaeology'' No. 76. CTT Printing Series Ltd.: Pembrokeshire.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Priceb"&gt;Price, J. (2000). "Roman Glass Production in Western Europe". In M-D Nenna (ed.) ''La Route Du Verre: ateliers primaries et secondaires du second millenaire av. J-C au Moyen Age''. pp. 123–124. Maison de l’Orient Mediterranean: Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most prolific glassblowing centers of the Roman period was established in [[Cologne]] on the river [[Rhine]] in [[Germany]] by late 1st century BC. Stone base molds and [[terracotta]] base molds were discovered from these Rhineland workshops, suggesting the adoption and the application of mold-blowing technique by the glassworkers.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; Besides, blown [[flagon]]s and blown jars decorated with ribbing, as well as blown perfume bottles with letters CCAA or CCA which stand for Colonia Claudia Agrippiniensis, were produced from the Rhineland workshops.&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vosea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt; Remains of blown blue-green glass vessels, for example [[bottle]]s with a handle, collared bowls and indented beakers, were found in abundance from the local glass workshops at [[Poetovio]] and [[Celeia]] in [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref name="Lazar"&gt;Lazar, I. 2006. Glass finds in Slovenia and neighbouring areas. In Journal of Roman Archaeology 19: 299–342.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving physical evidence, such as blowpipes and molds which are indicative of the presence of blowing, is fragmentary and limited. Pieces of clay blowpipes were retrieved from the late 1st century AD glass workshop at [[Avenches]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt; Clay blowpipes, also known as mouthblowers, were made by the ancient glassworkers due to the accessibility and availability of the resources before the introduction of the metal blowpipes. Hollow iron rods, together with blown vessel fragments and glass waste dating to approximately 4th century AD, were recovered from the glass workshop in [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]] of [[Spain]], as well as in [[Salona]] in [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;

===Middle Ages===
The glass blowing tradition was carried on in Europe from the medieval period through the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Renaissance]] in the demise of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. During the early medieval period, the Franks manipulated the technique of glassblowing by creating the simple corrugated molds and developing the claws decoration techniques.&lt;ref name="Tattonb"&gt;Tatton-Brown, V. (1991). "Early Medieval Europe AD 400 – 1066". In H. Tait (ed.) ''Five Thousand Years of Glass''. pp. 98–111.

''The History of Glass''. pp. 39–66. Macdonald &amp; Co. (Publishers) Ltd.: {{ISBN|0-85613-516-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blown glass objects, such as the drinking vessels that imitated the shape of the animal horn were produced in the Rhine and Meuse valleys, as well as in Belgium. The [[Byzantine]] glassworkers made mold-blown glass decorated with [[Christian]] and [[Jewish]] symbols in [[Jerusalem]] between late 6th century and the middle of the 7th century AD.&lt;ref name="Voseb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tait"/&gt; Mold-blown vessels with facets, relief and linear-cut decoration were discovered at [[Samarra]] in the Islamic lands.&lt;ref name="Voseb"/&gt;

[[Renaissance]] Europe witnessed the revitalization of glass industry in Italy. Glassblowing, in particular the mold-blowing technique, was employed by the [[Venice|Venetian]] glassworkers from [[Murano]] to produce the fine glassware which is also known as [[cristallo]].&lt;ref name="Tait"&gt;Tait, H. (1994). "Europe from the Middle Ages to Industrial Revolution". In H. Tait (ed.) ''Five Thousand Years of Glass''. pp. 145–187. British Museum Press: London {{ISBN|0-8122-1888-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Wood, P. (1989). "The Tradition from Medieval to Renaissance". In D. Klein &amp; W. Lloyd (eds.) ''The History of Glass''. pp. 67–92. Macdonald &amp; Co. (Publishers) Ltd.: {{ISBN|0-85613-516-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique of glassblowing, coupled with the cylinder and crown methods, was used to manufacture sheet or flat glass for [[window]] panes in the late 17th century.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt; The applicability of glassblowing was so widespread that glass was being blown in many parts of the world, for example, in [[China]], [[Japan]] and the Islamic Lands.

The Nøstetangen Museum at [[Hokksund]], [[Norway]] shows how glass was made according to ancient tradition. The Nøstetangenglassworks had operated there from 1741 to 1777, producing  table-glass and chandeliers in the German and English style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nostetangenmuseum.no/ ''Nøstetangen Glassworks'' (Nøstetangen)]. nostetangenmuseum.no&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nostetangenmuseum.no/?page_id=14 ''Gamle Sorenskrivergaarden'' (Nøstetangen)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324192422/http://nostetangenmuseum.no/?page_id=14 |date=2012-03-24 }}. nostetangenmuseum.no&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}

===Recent developments===
The "[[studio glass movement]]" began in 1962 when [[Harvey Littleton]], a ceramics professor, and [[Dominick Labino]], a chemist and engineer, held two workshops at the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], during which they started experimenting with melting glass in a small [[furnace]] and creating blown glass art. Littleton promoted the use of small furnaces in individual artists studios([http://www.handblownglass.com/Modern-Hand-Blown-Glass]). This approach to glassblowing blossomed into a worldwide movement, producing such flamboyant and prolific artists as [[Dale Chihuly]], [[Dante Marioni]], Fritz Driesbach and [[Marvin Lipofsky]] as well as scores of other modern glass artists. Today there are many different institutions around the world that offer glassmaking resources for training and sharing equipment.

Working with large or complex pieces requires a team of several glassworkers, in a complex [[choreography]] of precisely timed movements.  This practical requirement has encouraged collaboration among glass artists, in both semi-permanent and temporary working groups.

===In literature===
The writer [[Daphne du Maurier]] was descended from a family of glass-blowers in 18th century France, and she wrote about her forebears in the 1963 [[historical novel]] ''The Glass-Blowers''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382723.The_Glass_Blowers&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of mystery novelist [[Donna Leon]]'s ''Through a Glass, Darkly'' is the investigation of a crime in a Venetian glassworks on the island of Murano.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/donna-leon/through-a-glass-darkly/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Globalization and World Cities Research Network''', commonly abbreviated to '''GaWC''', is a [[think tank]] that studies the relationships between [[global city|world cities]] in the context of [[globalization]]. It is based in the [[geography]] department of [[Loughborough University]] in [[Leicestershire]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. GaWC was founded by [[Peter J. Taylor]] in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Peter J.|title=World city network: a global urban analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKpvD7nvBKUC&amp;pg=PR9|accessdate=2010-10-10|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-30249-8|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Together with Jon Beaverstock and [[Richard G. Smith (geographer)|Richard G. Smith]], they create the GaWC's bi-annual categorization of world cities into "Alpha", "Beta" and "Gamma" tiers, based upon their international connectedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donald|first1=Stephanie|last2=Gammack|first2=John G.|title=Tourism and the branded city|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gcAx3bjuC98C&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=2010-10-10|year=2007 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |location=London|isbn=0-7546-4829-X|page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GaWC city classification ==
The GaWC examines cities worldwide to narrow them down to a roster of world cities, then ranks these based on their connectivity through four "advanced producer services": accountancy, advertising, banking/finance, and law.&lt;ref name = "intro"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2018link.html |title=GaWC – The World According to GaWC 2018|publisher=Lboro.ac.uk |date= 13 November 2018|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GaWC inventory ranks city [[economics]] more heavily than political or cultural factors. Beyond the categories of "Alpha" world cities (with four sub-categories), "Beta" world cities (three sub-categories) and "Gamma" world cities (three sub-categories), the GaWC cities include additional cities at "High sufficiency" and "Sufficiency" level.

The 2004 rankings added several new indicators while continuing to rank city [[economics]] more heavily than political or cultural factors. The 2008 roster, similar to the 1998 version, is sorted into categories of Alpha world cities (with four sub-categories), Beta world cities (three sub-categories), Gamma world cities (three sub-categories) and additional cities with High sufficiency or Sufficiency presence. 

== 2018 city classification ==

[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|right|220px|[[Standing Buddha]] with a halo, 1st–2nd century AD (or earlier), [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]].]]
[[File:Masaccio chapelle Brancacci.png|thumb|right|320px|[[Jesus]] and nine of the [[Twelve Apostles]] depicted with "Floating" disk haloes in perspective (detail from ''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|The Tribute Money]]'', illustrating {{bibleverse||Matthew|17:24-27|KJV}}, by [[Masaccio]], 1424, [[Brancacci Chapel]]).]]

A '''halo''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἅλως}}, ''halōs'';&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|halo}} {{LSJ|a(/lws|ἅλως|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as a '''nimbus''', '''[[Aureola|aureole]]''', '''glory''', or '''gloriole''') is a crown of light rays, circle or disk of light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/halo-art|title=halo – art|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that surrounds a person in art.  They have been used in the [[iconography]] of many religions to indicate holy or sacred figures, and have at various periods also been used in images of rulers or heroes.  In the sacred art of [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]], among other religions, sacred persons may be depicted with a halo in the form of a circular glow, or flames in [[Asian art]], around the head or around the whole body—this last one is often called a [[mandorla]].  Halos may be shown as almost any color or combination of colors, but are most often depicted as golden, yellow or white when representing light or red when representing flames.

== Ancient Greek world ==
[[File:Octadrachm Ptolemy III BM CMBMC103.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Octadrachm]] of [[Ptolemy III]]]]

[[Homer]] describes a more-than-natural light around the heads of [[Greek hero|heroes]] in battle.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]]'' v.4ff, xviii.203ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of [[Perseus]] in the act of slaying [[Medusa]], with lines radiating from his head, appear on a white-ground toiletry box in the [[Louvre]] and on a slightly later [[Red-figure pottery|red-figured vase]] in the style of [[Polygnotos (vase painter)|Polygnotos]], ca. 450-30 BC, in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie J. Milne, "[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/bibliography/?id=12253 Perseus and Medusa on an Attic Vase]" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'' New Series, '''4'''.5 (January 1946, pp. 126-130) 126.p.) {{JSTOR|3257993}}&lt;/ref&gt; On painted wares from [[Magna Graecia|south Italy]], radiant lines or simple haloes appear on a range of mythic figures: Lyssa, a personification of madness; a [[sphinx]]; a sea demon; and [[Thetis]], the sea-nymph who was mother to [[Achilles]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Stephani, ''Nimbus und Strahlenkranz in den Werken der Alten Kunst" in ''Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences de Saint-Petersbourg'', series vi, vol. vol ix, noted in Milne 1946:130.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Colossus of Rhodes]] was a statue of the sun-god [[Helios]] and had his usual [[radiate crown]] (copied for the [[Statue of Liberty]]). [[Hellenistic]] rulers are often shown wearing radiate crowns that seem clearly to imitate this effect.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Further afield, [[Sumer]]ian religious literature frequently speaks of ''melam'' (loaned into [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] as ''melammu''), a "brilliant, visible glamour which is exuded by gods, heroes, sometimes by kings, and also by temples of great holiness and by gods' symbols and emblems."&lt;ref&gt;J. Black and A. Green, ''Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotmia'' (Austin, 1992) p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Asian art ==
[[File:Menander II with nimbate Nike.jpg|thumb|350px|Coin of [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Menander II]] (90–85 BCE), displaying [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] with a halo on the reverse.]]
The halo and the [[aureola]] have been widely used in Indian art, particularly in [[Buddhist]] iconography&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/publications/pdfs/asia/divided/d1_Art_S_Asia.pdf|title=Metropolitan Museum of Art: Art of South Asia|website=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it has appeared since at least the 1st century AD; the Kushan [[Bimaran casket]] in the [[British Museum]] is dated 60AD (at least between 30BC and 200AD).  The rulers of the [[Kushan Empire]] were perhaps the earliest to give themselves haloes on their coins, and the nimbus in art may have originated in Central Asia and spread both east and west.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org" /&gt;

In Chinese and Japanese [[Buddhist art]] the halo has also been used since the earliest periods in depicting the image of [[Amitabha|Amitabha Buddha]] and others. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] uses haloes and aureoles of many types, drawing from both Indian and Chinese traditions, extensively in statues and [[Thangka]] paintings of Buddhist saints such as [[Milarepa]] and [[Padmasambhava]] and deities.  Different coloured haloes have specific meanings: orange for monks, green for the Buddha and other more elevated beings,&lt;ref&gt;including the [[Qianlong Emperor]] – see note below. Rhie, Marylin and Thurman, Robert (eds):''Wisdom And Compassion: The Sacred Art of Tibet'', p. 99, &amp; passim, 2000, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8109-2526-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly figures have both a halo for the head, and another circular one for the body, the two often intersecting somewhere around the head or neck. Thin lines of gold often radiate outwards or inwards from the rim of the halo, and sometimes a whole halo is made up of these.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, pp 77, 176, 197 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In India the head halo is called ''Prabhamandala'' or ''Siras-cakra'', while the full body halo is ''Prabhavali''.&lt;ref&gt; Gopinatha  Rao, T. A. (1985).

[[Motilal Banarsidass]]. {{ISBN|9788120808782}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elaborate haloes and especially aureoles also appear in [[Hindu]] sculpture, where they tend to develop into architectural frames in which the original idea can be hard to recognise. [[Theravada]] Buddhism and [[Jainism]] did not use the halo for many centuries, but later adopted it, though less thoroughly than other religious groups.

In Asian art, the nimbus is often imagined as consisting not just of light, but of flames.  This type seems to first appear in Chinese bronzes of which the earliest surviving examples date from before 450.&lt;ref&gt;No doubt, as later, the same motif appeared in paintings, but none survive from this early.  L Sickman &amp; A Soper, "The Art and Architecture of China", Pelican History of Art, 3rd ed 1971, pp 86-7, Penguin (now Yale History of Art), LOC 70-125675&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of the flames may be very formalized, as in the regular little flames on the ring aureole surrounding many [[Chola]] bronzes and other classic Hindu sculptures of divinities, or very prominent, as with the more realistic flames, and sometimes smoke, shown rising to a peak behind many Tibetan Buddhist depictions of the "wrathful aspect" of divinities, and also in Persian miniatures of the classic period.  This type is also very rarely found, and on a smaller scale, in medieval Christian art.&lt;ref&gt;See Didron&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}  Sometimes a thin line of flames rise up from the edges of a circular halo in Buddhist examples.&lt;ref&gt;Often in paintings from the [[Dunhuang caves]], see Anne Farrer (ed), "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas" , 1990, British Museum publications, nos 42, 53, 54 etc, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Tibetan paintings the flames are often shown as blown by a wind, usually from left to right.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

Halos are found in [[Islamic art]] from various places and periods, especially in [[Persian miniature]]s and [[Moghul]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] art influenced by them.  Flaming halos derived from Buddhist art surround angels, and similar ones are often seen [[Depiction of Muhammad|around Muhammad]] and other sacred human figures.  From the early 17th century, plainer round haloes appear in portraits of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperors]] and subsequently [[Rajput]] and [[Sikh]] rulers;&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org" /&gt; despite the more local precedents art historians believe the Mughals took the motif from European religious art, though it expresses a Persian idea of the God-given [[charisma]] of kingship that is far older.&lt;ref&gt;Crill &amp; Jariwala, 29 and note&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] avoided using halos for the [[sultan]]s, despite their title as [[Caliph]], and they are only seen on Chinese emperors if they are posing as Buddhist religious figures, as some felt entitled to do.&lt;ref&gt;Such as the [[Qianlong Emperor]] [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:The_Qianlong_Emperor_in_Buddhist_Dress.jpg the Qianlong Emperor in Buddhist Dress], and his father.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo1.JPG|thumb|240px|right|[[Apollo]] with a radiant halo in a Roman floor [[mosaic]] (late 2nd century, [[El Djem]], Tunisia)]]

The halo represents an [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] or the glow of sanctity which was conventionally drawn encircling the head. It first appeared in the culture of Hellenistic Greece and [[Rome]], possibly related to the [[Zoroastrian]] ''hvarena'' – "glory" or "divine lustre" – which marked the Persian kings, and may have been imported with [[Mithraism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramsden|first=E.

In a late 2nd century AD floor mosaic from Thysdrus, [[El Djem]],   (''illustration'') [[Helios|Apollo Helios]] is identified by his effulgent halo.  Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from [[Hadrumentum]], is in the museum at [[Sousse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |title=Illustration |accessdate= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708143541/http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |archivedate=8 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling [[Hairstyle|hair cut]] in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BC to depict [[Alexander the Great]] (Bieber 1964; Yalouris 1980).

== In Christian art ==

[[File:ChristAsSol.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Early pre-4th century Mosaic of [[Sol Invictus]]&lt;ref&gt;According to the 1967 [[New Catholic Encyclopedia]], a standard library reference, in an article on ''[[Constantine the Great]]'': "Besides, the Sol Invictus had been adopted by the Christians in a Christian sense, as demonstrated in the Christ as [[Helios|Apollo-Helios]] in a [[mausoleum]] (c. 250) discovered beneath [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's in the Vatican]]."&lt;/ref&gt; in Mausoleum M in the pre-4th-century necropolis [http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/Necropolis/Scavi.htm beneath] [[St Peter's Basilica]] – interpreted by many as representing Christ.]]

The halo was incorporated into [[Early Christian art]] sometime in the 4th century with the earliest [[icon]]ic images of Christ, initially the only figure shown with one (together with his symbol, the [[Lamb of God]]).  Initially the halo was regarded by many as a representation of the ''[[Logos]]'' of Christ, his divine nature, and therefore in very early (before 500) depictions of Christ before his Baptism by [[John the Baptist|John]] he tends not to be shown with a halo, it being a matter of debate whether his ''Logos'' was innate from conception (the Orthodox view), or acquired at Baptism (the [[Nestorian doctrine|Nestorian]] view).  At this period he is also shown as a child or youth in ''Baptisms'', though this may be a hieratic rather than an age-related representation.&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'', 1971 (English trans. from German), Lund Humphries, London, p. 135, figs 150-53, 346-54. {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kölner Meister eines Evangelienbuches 001.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]'' and ''[[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|Transfiguration]]'' of Christ, with cross haloes; the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]], [[angel]]s and [[prophet]]s have plain ones. (1025–50, [[Cologne]]).]]

A '''cruciform halo''', that is to say a cross within, or extending beyond, a halo is used to represent the persons of the [[Holy Trinity]], especially [[Jesus]], and especially in medieval art.  In Byzantine and Orthodox images, inside each of the bars of the cross in Christ's halo is one of the [[Greek letter]]s Ο Ω Ν, making up {{lang|grc|[[I Am that I Am|ὁ ὢν]]}}—"ho ōn", literally, "the Existing One"—indicating the [[divinity of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Early Christian Symbols |url=http://www.catholicbiblical.ca/wp-content/uploads/Early-Christian-symbols.pdf |publisher=Catholic Biblical Association of Canada |accessdate=20 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223120343/http://www.catholicbiblical.ca/wp-content/uploads/Early-Christian-symbols.pdf |archivedate=23 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least in later Orthodox images, each bar of this cross is composed of three lines, symbolising the [[dogma]]s of the Trinity, the [[Divine simplicity|oneness of God]] and the [[Christology|two natures of Christ]].

In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] (432-40) the juvenile Christ has a four-armed cross either on top of his head in the radius of the nimbus, or placed above the radius, but this is unusual.  In the same mosaics the accompanying angels have haloes (as, in a continuation of the Imperial tradition, does [[Herod the Great|King Herod]]), but not [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]].  Occasionally other figures have crossed haloes, such as the seven doves representing the [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] in the 11th century [[Codex Vyssegradensis]] [[Tree of Jesse]] (where [[Jesse]] and [[Isaiah]] also have plain haloes, as do the [[Ancestors of Christ]] in other miniatures).&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'', 1971 (English trans. from German), Lund Humphries, London, figs 20-22, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, triangular haloes are sometimes given to [[God the Father]] to represent the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Halo Nationalgallery.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423223708/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Halo |date=23 April 2007 }},  Late 15th century reliefs by [[Jacopo della Quercia]] on the portal of San Petronio, Bologna are an early example of the triangular halo. According to Didron, Adolphe Napoléon: ''Christian Iconography: Or, The History of Christian Art in the Middle Ages'', London, 1851, Vol 2, p30, this is "extremely rare in France, but common enough in Italy and Greece&lt;/ref&gt;  When he is represented by a [[Hand of God (art)|hand emerging from a cloud]], this may be given a halo.

Plain round haloes are typically used to signify [[saint]]s, the Virgin Mary, [[Old Testament]] prophets, angels, symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]], and some other figures. [[Byzantine emperor]]s and empresses were often shown with them in compositions including saints or Christ, however the haloes were outlined only.  This was copied by Ottonian and later Russian rulers. Old Testament figures become less likely to have haloes in the West as the Middle Ages go on.&lt;ref&gt;Didron, Vol 2, pp.68-71&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pope Paschalis I. in apsis mosaic of Santa Prassede in Rome.gif|thumb|right|180px|[[Pope Paschal I]] is depicted during his lifetime, so with a square halo, c. 820, [[Santa Prassede]], Rome.]]
[[Beatification|Beatified]] figures, not yet canonised as saints, are sometimes shown in medieval Italian art with linear rays radiating out from the head, but no circular edge of the nimbus defined; later this became a less obtrusive form of halo that could be used for all figures.&lt;ref&gt;The distinction is observed in the ''Christ Glorified in the Court of Heaven'' (1423-4) by [[Fra Angelico]], [[National Gallery, London]], where only the beatified saints at the edges have radiating linear haloes.&lt;/ref&gt;   Mary has, especially from the [[Baroque]] period onwards, a special form of halo in a [[circle of stars|circle of twelve stars]], derived from her identification as the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]].

'''Square haloes''' were sometimes used for the living in [[donor portrait]]s of about 500-1100 in Italy;&lt;ref&gt;only in Italy, according to Didron, Vol 2 p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; Most surviving ones are of Popes and others in [[mosaic]]s in Rome, including the [[Episcopa Theodora]] head of the mother of the Pope of the day.  They seem merely an indication of a contemporary figure, as opposed to the saints usually accompanying them, with no real implication of future canonization. A late example is of [[Desiderius, Abbot of Monte Cassino]], later Pope, from a manuscript of 1056–86;&lt;ref&gt;see Didron, Vol 2 p.79 and Dodwell, C.R.; ''The Pictorial arts of the West, 800-1200'', 1993, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-06493-4}}, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Pope [[Gregory the Great]] had himself depicted with one, according to the 9th-century writer of his ''[[Hagiography|vita]]'', [[John, deacon of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Diaconus gives the reason: ''circa verticem tabulae similitudinem, quod viventis insigne est, preferens, non-coronam'' ("bearing around his head the likeness of a square, which is the sign for a living person, and not a crown") ([[Migne]], ''Pat. Lat.'' 75, 231). The deacon of Rome was unaware of the Eastern tradition of depicting the emperor with a halo.  Surviving examples are rare, and seem to be becoming rarer; Bishop Ecclesius has a clear one in older photos of the mosaics in [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale, Ravenna]], which appears to have been removed in recent restoration [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:SanVitale16.jpg Cupola of the choir] – see: James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', p100 &amp; photo p.93, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}.  Other surviving examples are [[Pope Hadrian I]] in a mural formerly in [[Santa Prassede]], Rome, donor figures in the church at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]  [http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/cr-03/cr-01/index.html and two more Roman examples – items 3 and 5]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630131544/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/cr-03/cr-01/index.html |date=30 June 2007 }}, one of Paschal's mother, the rather mysterious [[Episcopa Theodora]]. see also: Fisher, Sally.

Edited by Harriet Whelchel, Harry N Abrams, Inc., 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  A figure who may represent [[Moses]] in the 3rd century [[Dura Europos Synagogue]] has one, where no round halos are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dura_Europos_fresco_holy_man.jpg|title=Joshua.

James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', p202, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scalloped haloes, sometimes just appearing as made of radiating bars, are found in the manuscripts of the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] "Ada School", such as the [[Ada Gospels]].

The whole-body image of radiance is sometimes called the  '[[Aureola|aureole]]' or ''glory''; it is shown radiating from all round the body, most often of Christ or Mary, occasionally of saints (especially those reported to have been seen surrounded by one).  Such an aureola is often a [[mandorla]] ("almond-shaped" [[vesica piscis]]), especially around [[Christ in Majesty]], who may well have a halo as well.  In [[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|depictions of the Transfiguration of Jesus]] a more complicated shape is often seen, especially in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition, as in the famous 15th century icon in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;Didron, Vol 2, pp. 107-126&lt;/ref&gt;

Where gold is used as a background in [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], [[mosaic]]s and panel paintings, the halo is often formed by inscribing lines in the [[gold leaf]], and may be decorated in patterns ([[diapering]]) within the outer radius, and thus becomes much less prominent.  The gold leaf inside the halo may also be burnished in a circular manner, so as to produce the effect of light radiating out from the subject's head. In the early centuries of its use, the Christian halo may be in most colours (though black is reserved for [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], [[Satan]] and other evil figures) or multicoloured; later gold becomes standard, and if the entire background is not gold leaf, the halo itself usually will be.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Margaret Jensen, ''Understanding Early Christian Art'', p. 112, 2000, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-20454-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline of the halo ===
[[File:Fra Angelico 082.jpg|thumb|left|290px|[[Fra Angelico]]. ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]''.  Note the haloes of the kneeling figures at the front, seen from behind.]]

With increasing [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] in painting, the halo came to be a problem for artists.  So long as they continued to use the old compositional formulae which had been worked out to accommodate haloes, the problems were manageable, but as Western artists sought more flexibility in composition, this ceased to be the case.  In free-standing medieval [[sculpture]], the halo was already shown as a flat disk above or behind the head.  When [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] came to be considered essential, painters also changed the halo from an aura surrounding the head, always depicted as though seen full-on, to a flat golden disk or ring that appeared in perspective, floating above the heads of the saints, or vertically behind, sometimes transparent.  This can be seen first in [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]], who still gives Christ the cruciform halo which began to be phased out by his successors.  In northern Europe the radiant halo, made up of rays like a [[sunburst]], came into fashion in French painting around the end of the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tait, Hugh. ''Catalogue of the Waddesdon Bequest in the British Museum'', p. 43, 1986, British Museum Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7141-0525-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 15th century [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Robert Campin]] largely abandoned their use, although some other [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] artists continued to use them.&lt;ref&gt;Haloes were also often added by later dealers and restorers to such works, and indeed sometimes used to convert portraits into "saints". [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/neth/hd_neth.htm Intentional Alterations of Early Netherlandish Painting, Metropolitan Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Italy at around the same time, [[Pisanello]] used them if they did not clash with one of the enormous hats he liked to paint.  Generally they lasted longer in Italy, although often reduced to a thin gold band depicting the outer edge of the nimbus, usual for example in [[Giovanni Bellini]].  Christ began to be shown with a plain halo.
[[File:Madonna Benois.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (attributed),  ''[[The Benois Madonna|Benois Madonna]]''.  Floating semi-transparent haloes in perspective.]]

[[Fra Angelico]], himself a [[monk]], was a conservative as far as haloes are concerned, and some of his paintings demonstrate the problems well, as in several of his more crowded compositions, where they are shown as solid gold disks on the same plane as the picture surface, it becomes difficult to prevent them obstructing other figures.  At the same time they were useful in crowded narrative scenes for distinguishing the main, identifiable, figures from the mass of a crowd. [[Giotto]]'s [[Lamentation of Christ]] from the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] has eight figures with haloes and ten without, to whom the viewer knows they are not meant to attach a specific identity. In the same way, a ''Baptism of Christ'' by [[Perugino]] in Vienna gives neither Christ nor [[John the Baptist]] haloes, as sufficiently recognisable without them, but a saint in the background, not usually present in this scene, has a ring halo to denote his status.&lt;ref&gt;If not their identity. The painting has been partly repainted, and the current appearance may not be the original one. [[:File:Pietro Perugino 077.jpg|Vienna Perugino]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[High Renaissance]], even most Italian painters dispensed with haloes altogether, but in the Church's reaction to the [[Protestant Reformation]], that culminated in the [[Art in the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation#Council of Trent|decrees on images of the Council of Trent]] of 1563, their use was mandated by clerical writers on religious art such as [[Molanus]] and Saint [[Carlo Borromeo]].  Figures were placed where natural light sources would highlight their heads, or instead more discreet quasi-naturalistic flickering or glowing light was shown around the head of Christ and other figures (perhaps pioneered by [[Titian]] in his late period). [[Rembrandt]]'s [[etching]]s, for example, show a variety of solutions of all of these types, as well as a majority with no halo effect at all.  The disk halo was rarely used for figures from [[classical mythology]] in the Renaissance, although they are sometimes seen, especially in the classical radiant form, in [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] art.

By the 19th century haloes have become unusual in Western mainstream art, although retained in iconic and popular images, and sometimes as a medievalising effect.  When [[John Millais]] gives his otherwise realist ''[[St Stephen]]'' (1895) a ring halo, it seems rather surprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-saint-stephen-n01563|title=‘Saint Stephen’, Sir John Everett Millais, Bt, 1895 – Tate|first=|last=Tate|website=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular graphic culture, a simple ring has become the predominant representation of a halo since at least the late 19th century, as seen for example in the logo for the [[Simon Templar]] ("The Saint") series of novels and other adaptations.

== Spiritual significance in Christianity ==

The early [[Church Fathers]] expended much rhetorical energy on conceptions of God as a source of light; among other things this was because "in the controversies in the 4th century over the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son, the relation of the ray to the source was the most cogent example of emanation and of distinct forms with a common substance" – key concepts in the theological thought of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Notes on Castelseprio (1957) in Meyer Schapiro, Selected Papers, volume 3, p117, Late Antique, Early Christian and Mediaeval Art, 1980, Chatto &amp; Windus, London, {{ISBN|0-7011-2514-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more [[Catholic]] interpretation, less dualistic in its assumptions, is that the halo represents the light of divine grace suffusing the soul, which is perfectly united and in harmony with the physical body.

In the theology of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], an [[icon]] is a "window into heaven" through which Christ and the Saints in heaven can be seen and communicated with. The gold background of the icon indicates that what is depicted is in heaven. The halo is a symbol of the [[Uncreated Light]] (Greek: Ἄκτιστον Φῶς) or [[Divine grace|grace]] of God shining forth through the icon. [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] in his ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia|Celestial Hierarchies]]'' speaks of the angels and saints being illuminated by the grace of God, and in turn illumining others.

== Origins and usage of the different terms ==
[[File:Preobrazhenie.jpeg|thumb|Late Byzantine/Russian [[icon]] of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|Transfiguration]]. Christ is shown surrounded by a light blue aureole with white flashes of lightning (15th century,  attributed to [[Theophanes the Greek]], [[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[Moscow]]).]]

The distinction between the alternative terms in English is rather unclear.  The oldest term in English is "glory", the only one available in the [[Middle Ages]], but now largely obsolete. It came from the French "gloire" which has much the same range of meanings as "glory".  "Gloriole" does not appear in this sense until 1844, being a modern invention, as a diminutive, in French also. "Halo" is first found in English in this sense in 1646 (nearly a century after the optical or astronomical sense). Both "halos" and "haloes" may be used as plural forms, and halo may be used as a verb.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "glory", "gloriole" and "halo".&lt;/ref&gt;  Halo comes originally from the Greek for "threshing-floor" – a circular, slightly sloping area kept very clean, around which slaves or oxen walked to thresh the grain.  In Greek, this came to mean the divine bright disk.

Nimbus means a cloud in Latin and is found as a divine cloud in 1616, whereas as "a bright or golden disk surrounding the head" it does not appear until 1727.  The plural "nimbi" is correct but "rare"; "nimbuses" is not in the OED but sometimes used. "Nimb" is an obsolete form of the noun, but not a verb, except that the obsolete "nimbated", like the commoner "nimbate", means "furnished with a nimbus".  It is sometimes preferred by art-historians, as sounding more technical than halo.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "nimbus" etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Aureole", from the Latin for "golden", has been used in English as a term for a gold crown, especially that traditionally considered the reward of [[martyr]]s, since the Middle Ages (OED 1220).  But the first use recorded as a term for a halo is in 1848, very shortly after which matters were greatly complicated by the publication in 1851 of the English translation of [[Adolphe Napoléon Didron]]'s important ''Christian Iconography: Or, The History of Christian Art in the Middle Ages''.  This, by what the OED calls a "strange blunder", derived the word from the Latin "aura" as a diminutive, and also defined it as meaning a halo or glory covering the whole body, whilst saying that "nimbus" referred only to a halo around the head.  This, according to the OED, reversed the historical usage of both words, but whilst Didron's diktat was "not accepted in France", the OED noted it had already been picked up by several English dictionaries, and influenced usage in English, which still seems to be the case, as the word "nimbus" is mostly found describing whole-body haloes, and seems to have also influenced "gloriole" in the same direction.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "aureole".&lt;/ref&gt;

The only English term that unequivocally means a full-body halo, and cannot be used for a circular disk around the head is "[[mandorla]]", first occurring in 1883.  However, this term, which is the Italian word for "[[almond]]", is usually reserved for the [[vesica piscis]] shape, at least in describing Christian art.  In discussing Asian art, it is used more widely.&lt;ref&gt;For example by Sickman and Soper, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise, there could be said to be an excess of words that could refer to either a head-disk or a full-body halo, and no word that clearly denotes a full-body halo that is not vesica piscis shaped.  "Halo" by itself, according to recent dictionaries,&lt;ref&gt;Concise Oxford Dictionary, 1995, and Collins English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; means only a circle around the head, although Rhie and Thurman use the word also for circular full-body aureoles.&lt;ref&gt;op &amp; pages cit.  The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1911 (link above) has a further set of meanings for these terms, including glory.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9038">'''Heliotropism''', a form of [[tropism]], is the [[diurnal motion]] or seasonal motion of plant parts (flowers or leaves) in response to the direction of the sun. 
The habit of some plants to move in the direction of the sun was already known by the Ancient Greeks. They named one of those plants after that property [[Heliotropium]], meaning ''sun turn''. The Greeks assumed it to be a passive effect, presumably the loss of fluid on the illuminated side, that did not need further study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.plantcell.org/content/18/5/1110.full |title=Phototropism: Bending towards Enlightenment |first=Craig W. |last=Whippo |journal=The Plant Cell |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages= 1110–1119 |year=2006 |accessdate=2012-08-08 |doi=10.1105/tpc.105.039669 |pmid=16670442 |pmc=1456868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's logic that plants are passive and immobile organisms prevailed. In the 19th century, however, botanists discovered that growth processes in the plant were involved, and conducted increasingly ingenious experiments. [[A. P. de Candolle]] called this phenomenon in ''any'' plant ''heliotropism'' (1832).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=nl&amp;id=9T76HvJfH4AC&amp;dq=heliotropism+growth++candolle+-wikipedia&amp;q=candolle#v=snippet&amp;q=candolle&amp;f=false | author=Hart, J.W.| title=Plant Tropisms: And other Growth Movements| page=36| publisher=Springer|year=1990 |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed [[phototropism]] in 1892, because it is a response to light rather than to the sun, and because the phototropism of algae in lab studies at that time strongly depended on the brightness (positive phototropic for weak light, and negative phototropic for bright light, like sunlight).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ige.tohoku.ac.jp/outou/outou-e/Phototropism-e.html |title=Phototropism and photomorphogenesis of Vaucheria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nevsljDiCYC&amp;pg=PA673 |author1=Donat-Peter Häder |author2=Michael Lebert | title=Photomovement| page=676| publisher=Elsevier|year=2001 |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A botanist studying this subject in the lab, at the cellular and subcellular level, or using artificial light, is more likely to employ the more abstract word phototropism. The French scientist [[Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan]] was one of the first to study heliotropism when he experimented with the ''[[Mimosa pudica]]'' plant.
==Floral heliotropism==
Heliotropic flowers track the sun's motion across the sky from east to west. During the night, the flowers may assume a random orientation, while at dawn they turn again toward the east where the sun rises. The motion is performed by [[motor cell]]s in a flexible segment just below the flower, called a [[pulvinus]]. The motor cells are specialized in pumping [[potassium]] [[ion]]s into nearby tissues, changing their [[turgor pressure]]. The segment flexes because the motor cells at the shadow side elongate due to a ''turgor rise''. This is considered to be turgor-mediated heliotropism. For plant organs that lack pulvini, heliotropism can occur through irreversible cell expansion producing particular growth patterns. This form of heliotropism is considered to be growth-mediated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandenbrink|first=Joshua P.|last2=Brown|first2=Evan A.|last3=Harmer|first3=Stacey L.|last4=Blackman|first4=Benjamin K.|date=July 2014|title=Turning heads: The biology of solar tracking in sunflower|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/J.PLANTSCI.2014.04.006|journal=Plant Science|volume=224|pages=20–26|doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2014.04.006|issn=0168-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heliotropism is a response to light from the sun.

Several hypotheses have been proposed for the occurrence of heliotropism in flowers:
* The pollinator attraction hypothesis holds that the warmth associated with full [[insolation]] of the flower is a direct reward for [[pollinators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hocking B. |author2=Sharplin D. |title= Flower basking by arctic insects |journal=Nature |volume=206 |pages=206–215 |year=1965 |doi=10.1038/206215b0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v206/n4980/pdf/206215b0.pdf |issue=4980}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The growth promotion hypothesis assumes that effective [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of solar energy and the consequent rise in temperature has a favourable effect on [[pollen germination]], growth of the [[pollen tube]] and [[Seed|seed production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kevan, P.G. |title= Sun-tracking solar furnaces in high arctic flowers: significance for pollination and [[insects]]. |journal=Science |volume=189 |issue=4204|pages=723–726 |year=1975 |doi=10.1126/science.189.4204.723}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The cooling hypothesis, appropriate to flowers in hot climates, assumes that the position of flowers is adjusted to avoid overheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lang A.R.G. |author2=Begg J.E. |title= Movements of Helianthus annuus leaves and heads |journal= J Appl Ecol |volume=16 |pages=299–305 |year=1979 |doi=10.2307/2402749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, flower heliotropism could increase reproductive success by increasing [[pollination]], [[fertilization]] success, and/or seed development,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the spring flowers.

Some solar tracking plants are not purely heliotropic: in those plants the change of orientation is an innate circadian motion triggered by light, which continues for one or more periods if the light cycle is interrupted.

[[Tropical]] [[convolvulaceous]] flowers show a preferred orientation, pointing in the general direction of the sun but not exactly tracking the sun. They demonstrated no [[diurnal cycle|diurnal]] heliotropism but strong [[seasonal]] heliotropism. If solar tracking is exact, the sun’s rays would always enter the [[corolla tube]] and warm the [[gynoecium]], a process which could be dangerous in a [[tropical climate]]. However, by adopting a certain angle away from the solar angle, this is prevented. The trumpet shape of these flowers thus acts as a [[parasol]] shading the gynoecium at times of maximum [[solar radiation]], and not allowing the rays to impinge on the [[gynoecium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Patiño, S. |author2=Jeffree, C. |author3=Grace, J. |title=The ecological role of orientation in tropical convolvulaceous flowers |journal=Oecologia |volume=130 |pages=373–379 |year=2002 |doi=10.1007/s00442-001-0824-1 |url=http://www.biology.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/plant/PDF/2002/Patino-2002-373.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of [[sunflower]], a common [[List of common misconceptions|misconception]] is that sunflower heads track the Sun across the sky. The uniform alignment of the flowers does result from heliotropism in an earlier development stage, the [[bud]] stage, before the appearance of flower heads.  The apical bud of the plant will track the sun during the day from east to west, and then will quickly move west to east overnight as a result of the plant's circadian clock.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandenbrink|first=Joshua P.|last2=Brown|first2=Evan A.|last3=Harmer|first3=Stacey L.|last4=Blackman|first4=Benjamin K.|title=Turning heads: The biology of solar tracking in sunflower|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2014.04.006|journal=Plant Science|volume=224|pages=20–26|doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2014.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buds are heliotropic until the end of the bud stage, and finally face east. Phototropic bending can be catalyzed in the hypocotyls of juvenile sunflower seedlings while heliotropic bending in the shoot apex does not start occurring until the later developmental stages of the plant, showing a difference between these two processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The flower of the sunflower preserves the final orientation of the bud, thus keeping the mature flower facing east.

==Leaf heliotropism==
Leaf heliotropism is the solar tracking behavior of plant leaves. Some plant species have leaves that orient themselves perpendicularly to the sun's rays in the morning (''[[diaheliotropism]]''), and others have those that orient themselves parallel to these rays at midday (''[[paraheliotropism]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nevsljDiCYC&amp;pg=PA676|title=Photomovement|first1=D.-P.|last1=Häder|first2=M.|last2=Lebert|date=19 June 2001|publisher=Elsevier|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Floral heliotropism is not necessarily exhibited by the same plants that exhibit leaf heliotropism.

[[File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|thumb|''Birthday Book Printing'', the fourth of the six [[Walk of Ideas]] sculptures displayed in [[Berlin]] during 2006, represents a pile of modern [[codex]] books.]]

The '''history of books''' starts with the [[History of writing|development of writing]], and various other inventions such as [[paper]] and [[printing]], and continues through to the modern day business of [[book printing]]. The earliest history of books actually predates what would conventionally be called "books" today and begins with tablets, scrolls, and sheets of [[papyrus]]. Then hand-bound, expensive, and elaborate books known as [[codices]] appeared. These gave way to [[printing press|press-printed]] volumes and eventually lead to the mass printed tomes prevalent today. Contemporary books may even have no physical presence with the advent of the [[e-book]]. The book also became more accessible to the disabled with the advent of [[Braille]] and spoken books.

== Clay tablets ==
[[File:Tablet describing goddess Inanna's battle with the mountain Ebih, Sumerian - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - DSC07117.JPG|thumb|[[Sumer]]ian [[clay tablet]], currently housed in the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] at the [[University of Chicago]], inscribed with the text of the poem ''[[Inanna#Justice myths|Inanna and Ebih]]'' by the priestess [[Enheduanna]], the first author whose name is known&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberta Binkley|title=Rhetoric before and beyond the Greeks|year=2004|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791460993|pages=47|chapter=Reading the Ancient Figure of Enheduanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Clay tablets were used in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 3rd millennium BC. The calamus, an instrument in the form of a triangle, was used to make characters in moist clay. People used to use fire to dry the tablets out. At [[Nineveh]], over 20,000 tablets were found, dating from the 7th century BC; this was the archive and library of the kings of [[Assyria]], who had workshops of copyists and conservationists at their disposal. This presupposes a degree of organization with respect to books, consideration given to conservation, classification, etc. Tablets were used right up until the 19th century in various parts of the world, including Germany, Chile, Philippines and the Saharan Desert.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/educator/modules/gutenberg/books/early/|title=Early Writing|website=www.hrc.utexas.edu|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuneiform and Sumerian Writing ===
Writing originated as a form of record keeping in Sumer during the fourth millennium BCE with the advent of cuneiform. Many clay tablets have been found that show cuneiform writing used to record legal contracts, create lists of assets, and eventually to record Sumerian literature and myths. Scribal schools have been found by archaeologists from as early as the second millennium BCE where students were taught the art of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Papyrus ==
{{Main|Papyrus}}
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian Papyrus]]

After extracting the marrow from the stems of '''Papyrus reed''', a series of steps (humidification, pressing, drying, gluing, and cutting) produced media of variable quality, the best being used for sacred writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/papyrology-collection/how-ancient-papyrus-was-made|title=How Ancient Papyrus Was Made {{!}} U-M Library|website=www.lib.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Egypt]], papyrus was used as a medium for writing surfaces, maybe as early as from [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], but first evidence is from the account books of King [[Neferirkare Kakai]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty]] (about 2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books. The Book Arts from Antiquity to the Renaissance''. American Library Association / The British Library 1991, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; A calamus, the stem of a reed sharpened to a point, or bird feathers were used for writing. The script of Egyptian [[scribes]] was called [[hieratic]], or sacerdotal writing; it is not [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]], but a simplified form more adapted to manuscript writing (hieroglyphs usually being engraved or painted). Egyptians exported papyrus to other Mediterranean civilizations including Greece and Rome where it was used until parchment was developed.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Papyrus]] books were in the form of a [[scroll]] of several sheets pasted together, for a total length of 10 meters or more.  Some books, such as the history of the reign of [[Ramses III]], were over 40 meters long. Books rolled out horizontally; the text occupied one side, and was divided into columns. The title was indicated by a label attached to the cylinder containing the book. Many papyrus texts come from tombs, where prayers and sacred texts were deposited (such as the [[Book of the Dead]], from the early 2nd millennium BC).

[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|upright|A Chinese bamboo book]]

Before the introduction of books, writing on [[Oracle bone|bone]], shells, [[Bamboo and wooden slips|wood]] and [[silk]] was prevalent in [[China]] long before the 2nd century BC, until [[paper]] was invented in China around the 1st century AD. China's first recognizable books, called jiance or jiandu, were made of rolls of thin split and dried bamboo bound together with hemp, silk, or leather.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 18&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the process using the bark of the blackberry bush to create paper is attributed to [[Cai Lun|Ts'ai Lun]] (the cousin of Kar-Shun), but it may be older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipst.gatech.edu/amp/collection/museum_invention_paper.htm|title=Invention of Paper|website=www.ipst.gatech.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texts were reproduced by [[woodblock printing]]; the diffusion of Buddhist texts was a main impetus to large-scale production. The format of the book evolved with intermediate stages of scrolls folded [[concertina]]-style, scrolls bound at one edge ("butterfly books") and so on.

Although there is no exact date known, between 618 and 907 AD–The period of the Tang Dynasty–the first printing of books started in China.&lt;ref name=mcd&gt;{{cite book|last=McDermott|first=Joseph P.|title=A social history of the Chinese book: Books and literati culture in late imperial China|year=2006|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-962-209-782-7|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancientpages.com/2017/09/25/ancient-romans-invented-first-bound-book/|title=Ancient Romans Invented The First Bound Book {{!}} Ancient Pages|date=2017-09-25|work=Ancient Pages|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest extant printed book is a work of the [[Diamond Sutra]] and dates back to 868 AD, during the Tang Dynasty.&lt;ref name=mcd /&gt; The Diamond Sutra was printed by method of [[woodblock printing]], a strenuous method in which the text to be printed would be carved into a woodblock's surface, essentially to be used to stamp the words onto the writing surface medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://open.lib.umn.edu/mediaandculture/chapter/3-2-history-of-books/|title=3.2 History of Books {{!}} Understanding Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass Communication|website=open.lib.umn.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodblock printing was a common process for the reproduction of already handwritten texts during the earliest stages of book printing.

Because of the meticulous and time-consuming process that woodblock printing was, [[Bi Sheng]], a key contributor to the history of printing, invented the process of [[Movable type|movable type printing]] (1041-1048 AD).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/invention-woodblock-printing-tang-618%E2%80%93906-and-song-960%E2%80%931279|title=The Invention of Woodblock Printing in the Tang (618–906) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties|work=Asian Art Museum {{!}} Education|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silk-road.com/artl/movableprt.shtml|title=The Invention of Movable Type|last=Lee|first=Silkroad Foundation, Adela C.Y.|website=www.silk-road.com|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bi Sheng developed a printing process in which written text could be copied with the use of formed character types, the earliest types being made of [[ceramic]] or clay material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The method of movable type printing would later become improved by [[Johannes Gutenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html|title=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html|website=www.historyguide.org|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-columbian codices of the Americas ==
[[File:Dresden codex, page 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dresden Codex]] (page 49)]]

In Mesoamerica, information was recorded on long strips of paper, agave fibers, or animal hides, which were then folded and protected by wooden covers.  These were thought to have existed since the time of the Classical Period between the 3rd and 8th centuries, CE.  Many of these codices were thought to contain astrological information, religious calendars, knowledge about the gods, genealogies of the rulers, cartographic information, and tribute collection.  Many of these codices were stored in temples but were ultimately destroyed by the Spanish explorers.&lt;ref&gt;Suarez, M.E. &amp; Wooudhuysen, H.R. (2013). The book: A global history. Oxford, Oxford University Press. Pages 656–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the only completely deciphered pre-Columbian writing system is the [[Maya script]].  The Maya, along with [[Mesoamerican writing systems|several]] other cultures in [[Mesoamerica]], constructed concertina-style books written on [[Amate]] paper. Nearly all Mayan texts were [[Diego de Landa|destroyed]] by the Spanish during colonization on cultural and religious grounds.  One of the few surviving examples is the [[Dresden Codex]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/pt/item/11621/ |title = O Códice de Dresden |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1200–1250 |accessdate = 2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although only the Maya have been shown to have a writing system capable of conveying any concept that can be conveyed via speech (at about the same level as the modern [[Japanese writing system]]), other [[Mesoamerican]] cultures had more rudimentary [[Ideogram|ideographical writing systems]] which were contained in similar concertina-style books, one such example being the [[Aztec codices]].

=== Florentine Codex ===
There are more than 2,000 illustrations drawn by native artists that represent this era. Bernardino de Sahagun tells the story of Aztec people’s lives and their natural history. The Florentine Codex speaks about the culture religious cosmology and ritual practices, society, economics, and natural history of the Aztec people. The manuscript are arranged in both the Nahuatl language and in Spanish. The English translation of the complete Nahuatl text of all twelve volumes of the Florentine Codex took ten years. Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble had a decade of long work but made it an important contribution to Mesoamerican ethnohistory. Years later, in 1979, the Mexican government published a full-color volume  of the Florentine Codex. Now, since 2012, it is available digitally and fully accessible to those interested in Mexican and Aztec History.

The Florentine Codex is a 16th century ethnographic research study brought about by the Spanish Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagun. The codex itself was actually named ''La Historia Universal de las Cosas de Nueva España.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/516552.|title=Project MUSE|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernardino de Sahagun worked on this project from 1545 up until his death in 1590. The Florentine Codex consist of twelve books. It is 2400 pages long but divided into the twelve books by categories such as; The Gods, Ceremonies, Omens, and other cultural aspects of Aztec people.

== Wax tablets ==
[[File:Herkulaneischer Meister 002b.jpg|thumb|right|Woman holding wax tablets in the form of the [[codex]]. Wall painting from [[Pompeii]], before 79 AD.]]

Romans used wax-coated wooden tablets or ''pugillares'' upon which they could write and erase by using a [[stylus]]. One end of the stylus was pointed, and the other was spherical. Usually these tablets were used for everyday purposes (accounting, notes) and for teaching writing to children, according to the methods discussed by [[Quintilian]] in his ''Institutio Oratoria'' X Chapter 3. Several of these tablets could be assembled in a form similar to a [[codex]]. Also the etymology of the word codex (block of wood) suggest that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', Cambridge University Press 2003 [reprint], p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parchment ==
{{Main|Parchment}}

Parchment progressively replaced [[papyrus]].  Legend attributes its invention to [[Eumenes II]], the king of [[Pergamon]], from which comes the name "pergamineum," which became "parchment."  Its production began around the 3rd century BC.  Made using the skins of animals (sheep, cattle, donkey, antelope, etc.), parchment proved to be easier to conserve over time; it was more solid, and allowed one to erase text.  It was a very expensive medium because of the rarity of material and the time required to produce a document. [[Vellum]] is the finest quality of parchment.

=== Greece and Rome ===
The scroll of [[papyrus]] is called "volumen" in Latin, a word which signifies "circular movement," "roll," "spiral," "whirlpool," "revolution" (similar, perhaps, to the modern English interpretation of "swirl") and finally "a roll of writing paper, a rolled manuscript, or a book."
In the 7th century [[Isidore of Seville]] explains the relation between codex, book and scroll in his ''Etymologiae'' (VI.13) as this:
{{cquote|A codex is composed of many books (''librorum''); a book is of one scroll (''voluminis''). It is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks (''caudex'') of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock, because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches.}}

=== Description ===
The scroll is rolled around two vertical wooden axes.  This design allows only sequential usage; one is obliged to read the text in the order in which it is written, and it is impossible to place a marker in order to directly access a precise point in the text.  It is comparable to modern video cassettes.  Moreover, the reader must use both hands to hold on to the vertical wooden rolls and therefore cannot read and write at the same time.  The only volumen in common usage today is the Jewish [[Torah]].

=== Book culture ===
The authors of [[ancient history|Antiquity]] had no rights concerning their published works; there were neither authors' nor publishing rights.  Anyone could have a text recopied, and even alter its contents.  Scribes earned money and authors earned mostly glory, unless a patron provided cash; a book made its author famous.  This followed the traditional conception of the culture: an author stuck to several models, which he imitated and attempted to improve.  The status of the author was not regarded as absolutely personal.

From a political and religious point of view, books were censored very early: the works of [[Protagoras]] were burned because he was a proponent of [[agnosticism]] and argued that one could not know whether or not the gods existed. Generally, cultural conflicts led to important periods of book destruction: in 303, the emperor [[Diocletian]] ordered the burning of Christian texts.  Some [[Christians]] later burned libraries, and especially heretical or non-canonical Christian texts.  These practices are found throughout human history but have ended in many nations today.  A few nations today still greatly censor and even burn books.

But there also exists a less visible but nonetheless effective form of censorship when books are reserved for the elite; the book was not originally a medium for expressive liberty.  It may serve to confirm the values of a political system, as during the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]], who skillfully surrounded himself with great authors.  This is a good ancient example of the control of the media by a political power.  However, private and public censorship have continued into the modern era, albeit in various forms.

=== Proliferation and conservation of books in Greece ===
Little information concerning books in Ancient [[Greece]] survives.  Several vases (6th and 5th centuries BC) bear images of volumina.  There was undoubtedly no extensive trade in books, but there existed several sites devoted to the sale of books.

The spread of books, and attention to their cataloging and conservation, as well as literary criticism developed during the [[Hellenistic]] period with the creation of large libraries in response to the desire for knowledge exemplified by [[Aristotle]].  These libraries were undoubtedly also built as demonstrations of political prestige:
* The [[Library of Alexandria]], a library created by [[Ptolemy I|Ptolemy Soter]] and set up by [[Demetrius Phalereus]] (Demetrius of Phaleron). It contained 500,900 volumes (in the ''Museion'' section) and 40,000 at the Serapis temple (''Serapeion''). All books in the luggage of visitors to Egypt were inspected, and could be held for copying. The Museion was partially destroyed in 47 BC.
* The Library at [[Pergamon]], founded by [[Attalus I]]; it contained 200,000 volumes which were moved to the Serapeion by [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]], after the destruction of the Museion. The Serapeion was partially destroyed in 391, and the last books disappeared in 641 CE following the [[Arab]] conquest.
* The Library at [[Athens]], the ''Ptolemaion'', which gained importance following the destruction of the [[Library at Alexandria]] ; the [[Library of Pantainos]], around 100 CE; the library of [[Hadrian]], in 132 CE.
* The Library at [[Rhodes]], a library that rivaled the [[Library of Alexandria]].
* The Library at [[Antioch]], a public library of which [[Euphorion of Chalcis]] was the director near the end of the 3rd century.

The libraries had copyist workshops, and the general organisation of books allowed for the following:
* Conservation of an example of each text
* Translation (the [[Septuagint]] [[Bible]], for example)
* Literary criticisms in order to establish reference texts for the copy (example : ''[[The Iliad]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]'')
* A catalog of books
* The copy itself, which allowed books to be disseminated

=== Book production in Rome ===
Book production developed in [[Rome]] in the 1st century BC with Latin literature that had been influenced by the Greek. Conservative estimates places the number of potential readers in Imperial Rome at around 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/books/review/Beard-t.html|title=Scrolling Down the Ages|last=Beard|first=Mary|date=April 16, 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629200012/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/books/review/Beard-t.html|archive-date=June 29, 2017|dead-url=|quote=Imperial Rome had a population of at least a million. Using a conservative estimate of literacy levels, there would have been more than 100,000 readers in the city.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This diffusion primarily concerned circles of literary individuals.  [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]] was the editor of his friend [[Cicero]].  However, the book business progressively extended itself through the [[Roman Empire]]; for example, there were bookstores in [[Lyon]].  The spread of the book was aided by the extension of the Empire, which implied the imposition of the [[Latin]] tongue on a great number of people (in Spain, Africa, etc.).

[[Library|Libraries]] were private or created at the behest of an individual. [[Julius Caesar]], for example, wanted to establish one in Rome, proving that libraries were signs of political prestige.

In the year 377, there were 28 libraries in Rome, and it is known that there were many smaller libraries in other cities. Despite the great distribution of books, scientists do not have a complete picture as to the literary scene in antiquity as thousands of books have been lost through time.

== Paper ==
{{Main|History of paper}}

Papermaking has traditionally been traced to China about AD 105, when [[Cai Lun]], an official attached to the Imperial court during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD), created a sheet of paper using [[mulberry]] and other [[bast fibre]]s along with [[fishnets]], old rags, and [[hemp]] waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While paper used for wrapping and padding was used in China since the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]], p.&amp;nbsp;122&lt;/ref&gt;  paper used as a writing medium only became widespread by the 3rd century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 1"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century in China, sheets of paper were beginning to be used for [[toilet paper]] as well.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]], p.&amp;nbsp;123&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 AD) paper was folded and sewn into square [[tea bag|bags]] to preserve the flavor of tea.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt; The [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) that followed was the first government to issue [[banknote|paper currency]].

An important development was the mechanization of paper manufacture by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] papermakers. The introduction of water-powered [[paper mill]]s, the first certain evidence of which dates to the 11th century in Córdoba, Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Robert I.: "Paper comes to the West, 800–1400", in: Lindgren, Uta: ''Europäische Technik im Mittelalter. 800 bis 1400.

Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of [[parchment]] and then falling further.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Robert I.: "Paper comes to the West, 800–1400", in: Lindgren, Uta: ''Europäische Technik im Mittelalter. 800 bis 1400.

== Middle Ages ==
{{Main|Manuscript culture|Illuminated manuscript}}
[[File:Codex Manesse Ulrich von Singenberg.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[codex Manesse]]'', a book from the Middle Ages]]

By the end of antiquity, between the 2nd and 4th centuries, the [[scroll]] was replaced by the [[codex]]. The book was no longer a continuous roll, but a collection of sheets attached at the back.  It became possible to access a precise point in the text quickly.  The codex is equally easy to rest on a table, which permits the reader to take notes while he or she is reading.  The codex form improved with the separation of words, capital letters, and punctuation, which permitted silent reading.  Tables of contents and indices facilitated direct access to information.  This form was so effective that it is still the standard book form, over 1500 years after its appearance.

Paper would progressively replace parchment.  Cheaper to produce, it allowed a greater diffusion of books.

=== Books in monasteries ===
A number of Christian books were destroyed at the order of [[Diocletian]] in 304 AD. During the turbulent periods of the invasions, it was the monasteries that conserved religious texts and certain works of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for the West.  But there would also be important copying centers in [[Byzantium]].

The role of monasteries in the conservation of books is not without some ambiguity:
* Reading was an important activity in the lives of monks, which can be divided into prayer, intellectual work, and manual labor (in the [[Benedictine]] order, for example).  It was therefore necessary to make copies of certain works.  Accordingly, there existed scriptoria (the plural of scriptorium) in many monasteries, where monks copied and decorated manuscripts that had been preserved.
* However, the conservation of books was not exclusively in order to preserve ancient culture; it was especially relevant to understanding religious texts with the aid of ancient knowledge.  Some works were never recopied, having been judged too dangerous for the monks.  Moreover, in need of blank media, the monks scraped off manuscripts, thereby destroying ancient works.  The transmission of knowledge was centered primarily on sacred texts.

=== Copying and conserving books ===
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|An author portrait of [[Jean Miélot]] writing his compilation of the ''Miracles of Our Lady'', one of his many popular works.]]

Despite this ambiguity, monasteries in the West and the Eastern Empire permitted the conservation of a certain number of secular texts, and several libraries were created: for example, [[Cassiodorus]] ('Vivarum' in Calabria, around 550), or [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] in [[Constantinople]].  There were several libraries, but the survival of books often depended on political battles and ideologies, which sometimes entailed massive destruction of books or difficulties in production (for example, the distribution of books during the [[Iconoclasm]] between 730 and 842).  A long list of very old and surviving libraries that now form part of the [[Vatican Archives]] can be found in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]].

A very strong example of the early copying and conserving books is that of the [[Quran]]. After Muhammad, his companion Abu Bakr, on the recommendation of Umar Bin Alkhattab, assigned Zayd bin Saabit to compile the first official scripture of the Quran. Zayd collected all the available scriptures of the Quran scripted by different companions of Muhammad during his life. He compiled one scripture and got it verified by all the companions who had memorized the whole book while Muhammad was alive. Then this first official scripture was kept at the house of Hafsa, the wife of the Muhammad. By the time of the third caliph Uthmaan, the Islamic state had spread over a large portion of the known world. He ordered the preparation of the official copies of the first official scripture. The copies were duly verified for accuracy. These copies were sent to each city of the caliphate so that further copies can be made locally with the perfect accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quran#Compilation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To help preserve books and protect them from thieves, librarians would create [[Chained library|chained libraries]]. Chained Libraries were books displayed next to each other to create a tight bond. This eliminated unauthorised removal of books. One of the earliest chained libraries was in England during the 1500s. Popular culture also has examples of chained libraries, such as in [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]] by [[J.K Rowling]].

=== The ''scriptorium'' ===
The scriptorium was the workroom of monk copyists; here, books were copied, decorated, rebound, and conserved.  The armarius directed the work and played the role of librarian.

The role of the copyist was multifaceted: for example, thanks to their work, texts circulated from one monastery to another.  Copies also allowed monks to learn texts and to perfect their religious education.  The relationship with the book thus defined itself according to an intellectual relationship with [[God]].  But if these copies were sometimes made for the monks themselves, there were also copies made on demand.

The task of copying itself had several phases: the preparation of the manuscript in the form of notebooks once the work was complete, the presentation of pages, the copying itself, revision, correction of errors, decoration, and [[bookbinding|binding]].  The book therefore required a variety of competencies, which often made a manuscript a collective effort.

=== Transformation from the literary edition in the 12th century ===

[[File:Sandro Botticelli - The Virgin and Child (The Madonna of the Book) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|The scene in [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[Madonna of the Book]]'' (1480) reflects the presence of books in the houses of richer people in his time.]]
The revival of cities in Europe would change the conditions of book production and extend its influence, and the monastic period of the book would come to an end.  This revival accompanied the intellectual renaissance of the period. The [[Manuscript culture]] outside of the monastery developed in these university-cities in Europe in this time.  It is around the first universities that new structures of production developed: reference manuscripts were used by students and professors for teaching [[theology]] and liberal arts.  The development of commerce and of the bourgeoisie brought with it a demand for specialized and general texts (law, history, novels, etc.).  It is in this period that writing in the common vernacular developed (courtly poetry, novels, etc.).  Commercial scriptoria became common, and the profession of book seller came into being, sometimes dealing internationally.

There is also the creation of royal [[libraries]] as in the case of [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] and [[Charles V of France|Charles V]]. Books were also collected in private libraries, which became more common in the 14th and 15th centuries.

The use of paper diffused through Europe in the 14th century.  This material, less expensive than [[parchment]], came from China via the [[Arabs]] in Spain in the 11th and 12th centuries. It was used in particular for ordinary copies, while [[parchment]] was used for luxury editions.

== Printing press ==
{{Main|Printing press}}

The invention of the moveable type on the [[printing press]] by Johann Fust, Peter Schoffer and [[Johannes Gutenberg]] around 1440 marks the entry of the book into the industrial age.  The Western book was no longer a single object, written or reproduced by request.  The publication of a book became an enterprise, requiring capital for its realization and a market for its distribution. The cost of each individual book (in a large edition) was lowered enormously, which in turn increased the distribution of books.  The book in codex form and printed on paper, as we know it today, dates from the 15th century. Books printed before January 1, 1501, are called [[incunable]]s. The spreading of book printing all over Europe occurred relatively quickly, but most books were still printed in [[Latin]]. The spreading of the concept of printing books in the [[vernacular]] was a somewhat slower process.

== Contemporary era ==
During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] more books began to pour off European presses, creating an early form of information overload for many readers.  Nowhere was this more the case than in Enlightenment Scotland, where students were exposed to a wide variety of books during their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=Natural History, Natural Philosophy and Readership|journal=The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland|year=2012|volume=2|pages=297–309|url=https://www.academia.edu/3770441/Natural_History_Natural_Philosophy_and_Readership_in_Stephen_Brown_and_Warren_McDougall_eds._The_Edinburgh_History_of_the_Book_in_Scotland_Vol._II_Enlightenment_and_Expansion_1707-1800_Edinburgh_University_of_Edinburgh_Press_2012_297-309}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The demands of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (founded 1804), the [[American Bible Society]] (founded 1816), and other non-denominational publishers for enormously large inexpensive runs of texts led to numerous innovations. The introduction of steam printing presses a little before 1820, closely followed by new steam paper mills, constituted the two most major innovations.  Together, they caused book prices to drop and the number of books to increase considerably.  Numerous bibliographic features, like the positioning and formulation of titles and subtitles, were also affected by this new production method.  New types of documents appeared later in the 19th century:  [[photography]], [[sound recording]] and [[film]].

[[Typewriter]]s and eventually computer based word processors and printers let people print and put together their own documents. [[Desktop publishing]] is common in the 21st century.

Among a series of developments that occurred in the 1990s, the spread of digital multimedia, which encodes texts, images, animations, and sounds in a unique and simple form was notable for the book publishing industry. [[Hypertext]] further improved access to information. Finally, the [[internet]] lowered production and distribution costs.

=== E-books and the future of the book ===
It is difficult to predict the future of the book in an era of fast-paced technological change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Darnton]], ''The Case for Books: Past, Present and Future'', New York, Public Affairs, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-58648-826-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anxieties about the "death of books" have been expressed throughout the history of the medium, perceived as threatened by competing media such as radio, television, and the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8xg8EfQnnAC|title=The Future of the Book|last=Nunberg|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20451-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpNtvB4YF2cC|title=This is Not the End of the Book: A Conversation Curated by Jean-Philippe de Tonnac|last=Carrière|first=Jean-Claude|last2=Eco|first2=Umberto|date=2012-05-01|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0-09-955245-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these views are generally exaggerated, and "dominated by fetishism, fears about the end of humanism and ideas of techno-fundamentalist progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ballatore|first=Andrea|last2=Natale|first2=Simone|date=2015-05-18|title=E-readers and the death of the book: Or, new media and the myth of the disappearing medium|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/05/18/1461444815586984|journal=New Media &amp; Society|pages=1461444815586984|doi=10.1177/1461444815586984|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; The print book medium has proven to be very resilient and adaptable.

A good deal of reference material, designed for direct access instead of sequential reading, as for example [[encyclopedia]]s, exists less and less in the form of books and increasingly on the web. Leisure reading materials are increasingly published in e-reader formats.

Although electronic books, or e-books, had limited success in the early years, and readers were resistant at the outset, the demand for books in this format has grown dramatically, primarily because of the popularity of e-reader devices and as the number of available titles in this format has increased. Since the [[Amazon Kindle]] was released in 2007, the e-book has become a digital phenomenon and many theorize that it will take over hardback and paper books in future. E-books are much more accessible and easier to buy and it’s also cheaper to purchase an E-Book rather than its physical counterpart due to paper expenses being deducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teenink.com/opinion/current_events_politics/article/211256/Are-E-books-Taking-Over-the-Printed-World/|title=Are E-books Taking Over the Printed World? – Teen Politics Essay|website=www.teenink.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another important factor in the increasing popularity of the e-reader is its continuous diversification. Many e-readers now support basic operating systems, which facilitate email and other simple functions. The [[iPad]] is the most obvious example of this trend, but even mobile phones can host e-reading software.

== Reading for the blind ==
[[Braille]] is a system of reading and writing through the use of the finger tips. Braille was developed as a system of efficient communication for blind and partially blind alike.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://brailleworks.com/braille-resources/history-of-braille/|title=History of Braille - Braille Works|work=Braille Works|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system consists of sixty-three characters and is read left to right. These characters are made with small raised dots in two columns similar to a modern [[Dominoes|domino piece]] to represent each letter.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Braille-writing-system|title=Braille {{!}} writing system|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers can identify characters with two fingers. Reading speed averages one hundred and twenty-five words per minute and can reach two hundred words per minute.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== The making of Braille ===
Braille was named after its creator [[Louis Braille]] in 1824 in [[France]]. Braille stabbed himself in the eyes at the age of three with his father's leather working tools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Braille spent nine years working on a previous system of communication called [[night writing]] by [[Charles Barbier]]. Braille published his book "procedure for writing words, music, and plainsong in dots", in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nfb.org/1829-braille-book|title=1829 Braille Book|date=2010-10-04|work=National Federation of the Blind|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854 France made Braille the "official communication system for blind individuals".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; [[Valentin Haüy]] was the first person to put Braille on paper in the form of a book.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 1932 Braille became accepted and used in English speaking countries.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 1965 the Nemeth Code of Braille Mathematics and Scientific Notation was created. The code was developed to assign symbols to advanced mathematical notations and operations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The system has remained the same, only minor adjustments have been made to it since its creation.

=== Spoken books ===
The spoken book was originally created in the 1930s to provide the blind and visually impaired with a medium to enjoy books. In 1932 the [[American Foundation for the Blind]] created the first recordings of spoken books on vinyl records.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silksoundbooks.com/history-of-audiobooks.html|title=The History of the audiobooks|last=Silksoundbooks|website=www.silksoundbooks.com|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, a British based foundation, [[Royal National Institute of Blind People|Royal National Institute for the Blind]] (RNIB), was the first to deliver talking books to the blind on vinyl records.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each record contained about thirty minutes of audio on both sides, and the records were played on a [[Phonograph|gramophone]]. Spoken books changed mediums in the 1960s with the transition from vinyl records to cassette tapes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/a-short-history-of-the-audiobook-20-years-after-the-first-portable-digital-audio-device|title=A short history of the audiobook, 20 years after the first portable digital audio device|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next progression of spoken books came in the 1980s with the widespread use of compact discs. Compact discs reached more people and made it possible to listen to books in the car.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1995 the term [[audiobook]] became the industry standard.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Finally, the internet enabled audiobooks to become more accessible and portable. Audiobooks could now be played in their entirety instead of being split onto multiple disks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Academic discipline==

[[File:Bucheinband.15.Jh.r.Inkunabel.jpg|thumb|right|A 15th-century [[Incunable]]. Notice the blind-tooled cover, corner bosses and clasps.]]
The history of the book as an [[academic discipline]] studies the production, transmission, circulation and dissemination of text from [[Ancient history|antiquity]] to the present day. Its scope includes the book as object, the [[history of ideas]], [[history of religion]], [[bibliography]], [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]], [[archiving|curation]] and the future of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sites.hps.cam.ac.uk/research/hb.html Johns, A. (1998) Research Guide: The History of the Book. Department of History and Philosophy of Science. University of Cambridge]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
The history of the book came into existence in the latter half of the 20th century. It was fostered by [[William Ivins Jr.]]'s ''Prints and Visual Communication'' (1953) and [[Henri-Jean Martin]] and [[Lucien Febvre]]'s ''L'apparition du livre'' (''The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing, 1450–1800'') in 1958 as well as [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s ''Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man'' (1962).  Another notable pioneer in the History of the Book is [[Robert Darnton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=I.R.Willison|url=http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/8/1/July.pdf|title=The History of the Book as a Field of Study within the Humanities|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Certainty}}

A '''hypothesis''' (plural '''hypotheses''') is a proposed [[explanation]] for a [[phenomenon]]. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the [[scientific method]] requires that one can [[testable|test]] it. [[Scientist]]s generally base scientific hypotheses on previous [[observation]]s that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words "hypothesis" and "[[theory]]" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a [[scientific theory]]. A [[working hypothesis]] is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further [[research]],&lt;ref name="HilbornMangel1997"/&gt; in a process beginning with an educated guess or thought.&lt;ref name=Feynman /&gt; 

A different meaning of the term ''hypothesis'' is used in [[formal logic]], to denote the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] of a [[proposition]]; thus in the proposition "If ''P'', then ''Q''", ''P'' denotes the hypothesis (or antecedent); ''Q'' can be called a [[consequent]]. ''P'' is the [[:wikt:assumption|assumption]] in a (possibly [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]]) ''[[wikt:what if|What If]]'' question.

The adjective ''hypothetical'', meaning "having the nature of a hypothesis", or "being assumed to exist as an immediate consequence of a hypothesis", can refer to any of these meanings of the term "hypothesis".

==Uses==

In its ancient usage, ''[[Hypothesis (drama)|hypothesis]]'' referred to a summary of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[Theatre of ancient Greece|classical drama]]. The English word ''hypothesis'' comes from the [[ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:ὑπόθεσις|ὑπόθεσις]] word ''hupothesis'', meaning "to put under" or "to suppose".&lt;ref name="HilbornMangel1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hilborn |first1=Ray |last2=Mangel |first2=Marc |title=The ecological detective: confronting models with data |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=katmvQDi8PMC&amp;pg=PA24 |accessdate=22 August 2011 |year=1997 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03497-3 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Meno]]'' (86e–87b), [[Socrates]] dissects [[virtue]] with a method used by mathematicians,&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wilbur Knorr|Wilbur R. Knorr]], "Construction as existence proof in ancient geometry", p. 125, as selected by Jean Christianidis (ed.), ''Classics in the history of Greek mathematics'', Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt; that of "investigating from a hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt; [[Gregory Vlastos]], Myles Burnyeat (1994) ''Socratic studies'', Cambridge {{ISBN|0-521-44735-6}}, p. 1 &lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, 'hypothesis' refers to a clever idea or to a convenient mathematical approach that simplifies cumbersome [[calculation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Neutral hypotheses, those of which the subject matter can never be directly proved or disproved, are very numerous in all sciences." — [[Morris Raphael Cohen|Morris Cohen]] and  [[Ernest Nagel]] (1934) ''An introduction to logic and scientific method'' p. 375. New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bellarmine|Cardinal Bellarmine]] gave a famous example of this usage in the warning issued to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] in the early 17th century: that he must not treat the motion of the Earth as a reality, but merely as a hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;"Bellarmine (Ital. ''Bellarmino''), Roberto Francesco Romolo", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Eleventh Edition.: 'Bellarmine did not proscribe the Copernican system ... all he claimed was that it should be presented as a hypothesis until it should receive scientific demonstration.' {{EB1911|wstitle=Hypothesis|volume=14|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage in the 21st century, a ''hypothesis'' refers to a provisional idea whose merit requires evaluation. For proper evaluation, the framer of a hypothesis needs to define specifics in operational terms. A hypothesis requires more work by the researcher in order to either confirm or disprove it. In due course, a confirmed hypothesis may become part of a theory or occasionally may grow to become a theory itself. Normally, scientific hypotheses have the form of a [[mathematical model]].&lt;ref&gt;Crease, Robert P.  (2008) ''The Great Equations'' {{ISBN|978-0-393-06204-5}},  p.112 lists the [[conservation of energy]] as an example of accounting a [[constant of motion]]. Hypothesized by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], truth demonstrated by [[James Prescott Joule]], proven by [[Emmy Noether]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, but not always, one can also formulate them as [[existential quantification|existential statements]], stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon under examination has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of [[Universal quantification|universal statements]], stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic.

In entrepreneurial science, a hypothesis is used to formulate provisional ideas within a business setting. The formulated hypothesis is then evaluated where either the hypothesis is proven to be "true" or "false" through a [[Authentication|verifiability]]- or [[falsifiability]]-oriented [[experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything Harvard Business Review (2013) "Why Lean Startup Changes Everything"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://grasshopperherder.com/success-metric-vs-fail-condition-to-the-pain/ Tristan Kromer 2014 "Success Metric vs. Fail Condition"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://leanstartup.pbworks.com/w/page/65946049/Intro%20to%20Lean%20Startup Lean Startup Circle "What is Lean Startup?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Any useful hypothesis will enable [[prediction]]s by [[reasoning]] (including [[deductive reasoning]]). It might predict the outcome of an [[experiment]] in a [[laboratory]] setting or the observation of a phenomenon in [[nature]]. The prediction may also invoke statistics and only talk about probabilities. [[Karl Popper]], following others, has argued that a hypothesis must be [[falsificationism|falsifiable]], and that one cannot regard a proposition or theory as scientific if it does not admit the possibility of being shown false. Other philosophers of science have rejected the criterion of falsifiability or supplemented it with other criteria, such as verifiability (e.g., [[verificationism]]) or coherence (e.g., [[confirmation holism]]). The [[scientific method]] involves experimentation, to test the ability of some hypothesis to adequately answer the question under investigation. In contrast, unfettered observation is not as likely to raise unexplained issues or open questions in science, as would the formulation of a [[crucial experiment]] to test the hypothesis. A [[thought experiment]] might also be used to test the hypothesis as well.

In framing a hypothesis, the investigator must not currently know the outcome of a test or that it remains reasonably under continuing investigation. Only in such cases does the experiment, test or study potentially increase the probability of showing the truth of a hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp17,49–50}} If the researcher already knows the outcome, it counts as a "consequence" — and the researcher should have already considered this while formulating the hypothesis. If one cannot assess the predictions by observation or by [[experience]], the hypothesis needs to be tested by others providing observations. For example, a new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible.

==Scientific hypothesis==
People refer to a trial solution to a problem as a hypothesis, often called an "[[educated guess]]"&lt;ref&gt;
"When it is not clear under which law of nature an effect or class of effect belongs, we try to fill this gap by means of a guess. Such guesses have been given the name ''conjectures'' or ''hypotheses''.", [[Hans Christian Ørsted]](1811) "First Introduction to General Physics" ¶18. ''Selected Scientific Works of Hans Christian Ørsted'', {{ISBN|0-691-04334-5}} p.297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feynman &gt;"In general we look for a new law by the following process. First we guess it. ...", —[[Richard Feynman]] (1965) ''[[The Character of Physical Law]]'' p.156&lt;/ref&gt; because it provides a suggested outcome based on the evidence. However, some scientists reject the term "educated guess" as incorrect. Experimenters may test and reject several hypotheses before solving the problem.

According to Schick and Vaughn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Schick, Theodore |authorlink1=Theodore Schick |author2=Vaughn, Lewis |title=How to think about weird things: critical thinking for a New Age |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |location=Boston |year=2002 |isbn=0-7674-2048-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers weighing up alternative hypotheses may take into consideration:
* [[Testability]] (compare [[falsifiability]] as discussed above)
* Parsimony (as in the application of "[[Occam's razor]]", discouraging the postulation of excessive numbers of [[entity|entities]])
* Scope – the apparent application of the hypothesis to multiple cases of [[Phenomenon|phenomena]]
* Fruitfulness – the prospect that a hypothesis may explain further phenomena in the future
* Conservatism – the degree of "fit" with existing recognized knowledge-systems.

==Working hypothesis==
{{main|Working hypothesis}}
A [[working hypothesis]] is a hypothesis that is provisionally accepted as a basis for further research&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science &amp; Medicine''. [http://www.answers.com/topic/working-hypothesis Eprint] via Answers.com.&lt;/ref&gt; in the hope that a tenable theory will be produced, even if the hypothesis ultimately fails.&lt;ref name=Century&gt;See in "hypothesis", ''[[Century Dictionary]] Supplement'', v. 1, 1909, New York: [[The Century Company]]. Reprinted, [https://archive.org/stream/centurydictionar11whituoft#page/616/mode/1up v. 11, p. 616] (via ''Internet Archive'') of the ''Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia'', 1911. {{quote|'''hypothesis''' [...]—'''Working hypothesis''', a hypothesis suggested or supported in some measure by features of observed facts, from which consequences may be deduced which can be tested by experiment and special observations, and which it is proposed to subject to an extended course of such investigation, with the hope that, even should the hypothesis thus be overthrown, such research may lead to a tenable theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like all hypotheses, a working hypothesis is constructed as a statement of expectations, which can be linked to the [[exploratory research]] purpose in empirical investigation. Working hypotheses are often used as a [[conceptual framework]] in qualitative research.&lt;ref&gt;

The provisional nature of working hypotheses make them useful as an organizing device in applied research. Here they act like a useful guide to address problems that are still in a formative phase.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields]] and Nandhini Rangarajan. 2013. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false.  ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management'']. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. pp. 109–157&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, philosophers of science have tried to integrate the various approaches to evaluating hypotheses, and the scientific method in general, to form a more complete system that integrates the individual concerns of each approach. Notably, [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]], Karl Popper's colleague and student, respectively, have produced novel attempts at such a synthesis.

==Hypotheses, concepts and measurement==
[[Concept]]s in Hempel's [[deductive-nomological model]] play a key role in the development and testing of hypotheses. Most formal hypotheses connect concepts by specifying the expected relationships between [[proposition]]s. When a set of hypotheses are grouped together they become a type of [[conceptual framework]]. When a [[conceptual framework]] is complex and incorporates causality or explanation it is generally referred to as a theory. According to noted philosopher of science [[Carl Gustav Hempel]] "An adequate empirical interpretation turns a theoretical system into a testable theory: The hypothesis whose constituent terms have been interpreted become capable of test by reference to observable phenomena. Frequently the interpreted hypothesis will be derivative hypotheses of the theory; but their confirmation or disconfirmation by empirical data will then immediately strengthen or weaken also the primitive hypotheses from which they were derived."&lt;ref&gt;Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Hempel provides a useful metaphor that describes the relationship between a [[conceptual framework]] and the framework as it is observed and perhaps tested (interpreted framework).  "The whole system floats, as it were, above the plane of observation and is anchored to it by rules of interpretation. These might be viewed as strings which are not part of the network but link certain points of the latter with specific places in the plane of observation. By virtue of those interpretative connections, the network can function as a scientific theory."&lt;ref&gt;Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Hypotheses with concepts anchored in the plane of observation are ready to be tested. In "actual scientific practice the process of framing a theoretical structure and of interpreting it are not always sharply separated, since the intended interpretation usually guides the construction of the theoretician."&lt;ref name="Hempel, C. G. 1952 p. 33"&gt;Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, "possible and indeed desirable, for the purposes of logical clarification, to separate the two steps conceptually."&lt;ref name="Hempel, C. G. 1952 p. 33"/&gt;

===Statistical hypothesis testing===
{{Main|Statistical hypothesis testing}}
When a possible [[correlation]] or similar relation between phenomena is investigated, such as whether a proposed remedy is effective in treating a disease, the hypothesis that a relation exists cannot be examined the same way one might examine a proposed new law of nature. In such an investigation, if the tested remedy shows no effect in a few cases, these do not necessarily falsify the hypothesis. Instead, [[statistical test]]s are used to determine how likely it is that the overall effect would be observed if the hypothesized relation does not exist. If that likelihood is sufficiently small (e.g., less than 1%), the existence of a relation may be assumed. Otherwise, any observed effect may be due to pure chance.

In statistical hypothesis testing, two hypotheses are compared. These are called the [[null hypothesis]] and the [[alternative hypothesis]]. The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that states that there is no relation between the phenomena whose relation is under investigation, or at least not of the form given by the alternative hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis, as the name suggests, is the alternative to the null hypothesis: it states that there ''is'' some kind of relation. The alternative hypothesis may take several forms, depending on the nature of the hypothesized relation; in particular, it can be two-sided (for example: there is ''some'' effect, in a yet unknown direction) or one-sided (the direction of the hypothesized relation, positive or negative, is fixed in advance).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v-walRnRxWQC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=statistical+hypothesis+medical&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oFm-U_CbLYexPIragIAB&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=statistical%20hypothesis%20medical&amp;f=false Altman. DG., ''Practical Statistics for Medical Research'', CRC Press, 1990, Section 8.5,]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional significance levels for testing hypotheses (acceptable probabilities of wrongly rejecting a true null hypothesis) are .10, .05, and .01. The significance level for deciding whether the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted must be determined in advance, before the observations are collected or inspected. If these criteria are determined later, when the data to be tested are already known, the test is invalid.&lt;ref name="Mellenbergh, 2008"&gt;Mellenbergh, G.J.(2008). Chapter 8: Research designs: Testing of research hypotheses. In [[H.J. Adèr]] &amp; [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|G.J. Mellenbergh]] (Eds.) (with contributions by D.J. Hand), Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion (pp. 183-209). Huizen, The Netherlands: Johannes van Kessel Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The above procedure is actually dependent on the number of the participants (units or [[sample size]]) that are included in the study. For instance, to avoid having the sample size be too small to reject a null hypothesis, it is recommended that one specify a sufficient sample size from the beginning. It is advisable to define a small, medium and large effect size for each of a number of important statistical tests which are used to test the hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v-walRnRxWQC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=statistical+hypothesis+medical&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oFm-U_CbLYexPIragIAB&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=statistical%20hypothesis%20medical&amp;f=false Altman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24162">'''IEEE 754-1985''' was an industry [[technical standard|standard]] for representing [[floating-point]] numbers in [[computers]], officially adopted in 1985 and superseded in 2008 by [[IEEE 754-2008]]. During its 23 years, it was the most widely used format for floating-point computation. It was implemented in software, in the form of floating-point [[library (computing)|libraries]], and in hardware, in the [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] of many [[CPU]]s and [[floating-point unit|FPUs]]. The first [[integrated circuit]] to implement the draft of what was to become IEEE&amp;nbsp;754-1985 was the [[Intel 8087]].

IEEE 754-1985 represents numbers in [[binary numeral system|binary]], providing definitions for four levels of precision, of which the two most commonly used are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Level
!Width
!Range at full precision
!Precision{{efn|Precision: The number of decimal digits precision is calculated via number_of_mantissa_bits * Log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(2). Thus ~7.2 and ~15.9 for single and double precision respectively.}}
|-
|Single precision
|32 bits
|±1.18{{e|-38}} to ±3.4{{e|38}}
|Approximately 7 decimal digits
|-
|Double precision
|64 bits
|±2.23{{e|-308}} to ±1.80{{e|308}}
|Approximately 16 decimal digits
|}

The standard also defines representations for positive and negative [[infinity]], a "[[negative zero]]", five exceptions to handle invalid results like [[division by zero]], special values called [[NaN]]s for representing those exceptions, [[denormal numbers]] to represent numbers smaller than shown above, and four [[rounding]] modes.

== Representation of numbers ==

[[Image:IEEE 754 Single Floating Point Format.svg|right|frame|The number 0.15625 represented as a single-precision IEEE 754-1985 floating-point number. See text for explanation.]]
[[Image:IEEE 754 Double Floating Point Format.svg|right|frame|The three fields in a 64bit IEEE 754 float]]

Floating-point numbers in IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 format consist of three fields: a [[sign bit]], a [[exponent bias|biased exponent]], and a fraction. The following example illustrates the meaning of each.

The decimal number 0.15625&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; represented in binary is 0.00101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (that is, 1/8 + 1/32). (Subscripts indicate the number [[radix|base]].) Analogous to [[scientific notation]], where numbers are written to have a single non-zero digit to the left of the decimal point, we rewrite this number so it has a single 1 bit to the left of the "binary point". We simply multiply by the appropriate power of 2 to compensate for shifting the bits left by three positions:

: &lt;math&gt;0.00101_2 = 1.01_2 \times 2^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can read off the fraction and the exponent: the fraction is .01&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the exponent is −3.

As illustrated in the pictures, the three fields in the IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 representation of this number are:

: ''sign'' = 0, because the number is positive. (1 indicates negative.)
: ''biased exponent'' = −3 + the "bias". In '''single precision''', the bias is '''127''', so in this example the biased exponent is 124; in '''double precision''', the bias is '''1023''', so the biased exponent in this example is 1020.
: ''fraction'' = .01000…&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 adds a [[offset binary|bias]] to the exponent so that numbers can in many cases be compared conveniently by the same hardware that compares signed [[2's-complement]] integers. Using a biased exponent, the lesser of two positive floating-point numbers will come out "less than" the greater following the same ordering as for [[sign and magnitude]] integers. If two floating-point numbers have different signs, the sign-and-magnitude comparison also works with biased exponents. However, if both biased-exponent floating-point numbers are negative, then the ordering must be reversed. If the exponent were represented as, say, a 2's-complement number, comparison to see which of two numbers is greater would not be as convenient.

The leading 1 bit is omitted since all numbers except zero start with a leading 1; the leading 1 is implicit and doesn't actually need to be stored which gives an extra bit of precision for "free."

=== Zero ===

The number zero is represented specially:

: ''sign'' = 0 for [[signed zero|positive zero]], 1 for [[signed zero|negative zero]].
: ''biased exponent'' = 0.
: ''fraction'' = 0.

=== Denormalized numbers ===

The number representations described above are called ''normalized,'' meaning that the implicit leading binary digit is a 1. To reduce the loss of precision when an [[Arithmetic underflow|underflow]] occurs, IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 includes the ability to represent fractions smaller than are possible in the normalized representation, by making the implicit leading digit a 0. Such numbers are called [[denormal numbers|denormal]]. They don't include as many [[significant digits]] as a normalized number, but they enable a gradual loss of precision when the result of an [[Floating-point arithmetic#Floating-point arithmetic operations|arithmetic operation]] is not exactly zero but is too close to zero to be represented by a normalized number.

A denormal number is represented with a biased exponent of all 0 bits, which represents an exponent of −126 in single precision (not −127), or −1022 in double precision (not −1023).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hennessy|title=Computer Organization and Design|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the smallest biased exponent representing a normal number is 1 (see [[#Examples|examples]] below).

== Representation of non-numbers ==

The biased-exponent field is filled with all 1 bits to indicate either infinity or an invalid result of a computation.

=== Positive and negative infinity ===

[[Extended real line|Positive and negative infinity]] are represented thus:

: ''sign'' = 0 for positive infinity, 1 for negative infinity.
: ''biased exponent'' = all 1 bits.
: ''fraction'' = all 0 bits.

=== NaN ===

Some operations of [[Floating-point arithmetic#Floating-point arithmetic operations|floating-point arithmetic]] are invalid, such as taking the square root of a negative number. The act of reaching an invalid result is called a floating-point ''exception.'' An exceptional result is represented by a special code called a NaN, for "[[Not a Number]]". All NaNs in IEEE&amp;nbsp;754-1985 have this format:

: ''sign'' = either 0 or 1.

== Range and precision ==
[[File:IEEE 754 relative precision.svg|thumb|Relative precision of single (binary32) and double precision (binary64) numbers, compared with decimal representations using a fixed number of [[significant digits]]. Relative precision is defined here as ulp(''x'')/''x'', where ulp(''x'') is the [[unit in the last place]] in the representation of ''x'', i.e. the gap between ''x'' and the next representable number.]]
Precision is defined as the minimum difference between two successive mantissa representations; thus it is a function only in the mantissa; while the gap is defined as the difference between two successive numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Computer Arithmetic |author1=Hossam A.

As an example, 16,777,217 can not be encoded as a 32-bit float as it will be rounded to 16,777,216. This shows why floating point arithmetic is unsuitable for accounting software.  However, all integers within the representable range that are a power of 2 can be stored in a 32-bit float without rounding.

=== Double precision ===

[[Double-precision]] numbers occupy 64 bits. In double precision:
* The positive and negative numbers closest to zero (represented by the denormalized value with all 0s in the Exp field and the binary value 1 in the Fraction field) are
*: ±2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1074&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ ±4.94066{{e|−324}}
* The positive and negative normalized numbers closest to zero (represented with the binary value 1 in the Exp field and 0 in the fraction field) are

* The finite positive and finite negative numbers furthest from zero (represented by the value with 2046 in the Exp field and all 1s in the fraction field) are
*: ±(1−2&lt;sup&gt;−53&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;times; 2&lt;sup&gt;1024&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Kahan" /&gt; ≈ ±1.79769{{e|308}}

=== Extended formats ===

The standard also recommends extended format(s) to be used to perform internal computations at a higher precision than that required for the final result, to minimise round-off errors: the standard only specifies minimum precision and exponent requirements for such formats. The [[x87]] [[extended precision|80-bit extended format]] is the most commonly implemented extended format that meets these requirements.

==Comparing floating-point numbers==
Every possible bit combination is either a NaN or a number with a unique value in the [[affinely extended real number system]] with its associated order, except for the two bit combinations negative zero and positive zero, which sometimes require special attention (see below).  The [[#Representation_of_numbers|binary representation]] has the special property that, excluding NaNs, any two numbers can be compared as [[sign and magnitude]] integers ([[endianness]] issues apply).  When comparing as [[2's-complement]] integers:  If the sign bits differ, the negative number precedes the positive number, so 2's complement gives the correct result (except that negative zero and positive zero should be considered equal).  If both values are positive, the 2's complement comparison again gives the correct result.  Otherwise (two negative numbers), the correct FP ordering is the opposite of the 2's complement ordering.

Rounding errors inherent in floating point calculations often make comparison of results for exact equality not useful.  Choosing an acceptable range is a complex topic.

Although negative zero and positive zero are generally considered equal for comparison purposes, some [[programming language]] [[relational operator]]s and similar constructs might or do treat them as distinct. According to the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] Language Specification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/|title=Java Language and Virtual Machine Specifications|website=Java Documentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; comparison and equality operators treat them as equal, but &lt;code&gt;Math.min()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Math.max()&lt;/code&gt; distinguish them (officially starting with Java version 1.1 but actually with 1.1.1), as do the comparison methods &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;compareTo()&lt;/code&gt; and even &lt;code&gt;compare()&lt;/code&gt; of classes &lt;code&gt;Float&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt;.

==Rounding floating-point numbers==
The IEEE standard has four different rounding modes; the first is the default; the others are called ''[[directed rounding]]s''.

* '''Round to Nearest''' &amp;ndash; rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway it is rounded to the nearest value with an even (zero) least significant bit, which means it is rounded up 50% of the time (in [[IEEE 754-2008]] this mode is called ''roundTiesToEven'' to distinguish it from another round-to-nearest mode)
* '''Round toward 0''' &amp;ndash; directed rounding towards zero
* '''Round toward +∞''' &amp;ndash; directed rounding towards positive infinity
* '''Round toward −∞''' &amp;ndash; directed rounding towards negative infinity.

==Extending the real numbers==
The IEEE standard employs (and extends) the [[affinely extended real number system]], with separate positive and negative infinities. During drafting, there was a proposal for the standard to incorporate the [[projectively extended real number system]], with a single unsigned infinity, by providing programmers with a mode selection option. In the interest of reducing the complexity of the final standard, the projective mode was dropped, however. The [[Intel 8087]] and [[Intel 80287]] [[floating point]] [[co-processor]]s both support this projective mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems|volume=18|issue=2|date=March 1996|format=PDF|url=http://www.jhauser.us/publications/1996_Hauser_FloatingPointExceptions.html|author=John R. Hauser|title=Handling Floating-Point Exceptions in Numeric Programs|doi=10.1145/227699.227701|pages=139–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=IEEE Task P754: A proposed standard for binary floating-point arithmetic|date=March 1981|journal=IEEE Computer|volume=14|issue=3|pages=51–62|author=David Stevenson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= William Kahan and John Palmer|year=1979|title=On a proposed floating-point standard|journal=SIGNUM Newsletter|volume=14|issue=Special|pages=13–21|doi= 10.1145/1057520.1057522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions and predicates==

===Standard operations===
The following functions must be provided:
*[[arithmetic operations|Add, subtract, multiply, divide]]
*[[Square root]]
*Floating point remainder. This is not like a normal [[modulo operation]], it can be negative for two positive numbers. It returns the exact value of {{math|x–(round(x/y)·y)}}.
*[[rounding to integer|Round to nearest integer]]. For undirected rounding when halfway between two integers the even integer is chosen.
*Comparison operations. Besides the more obvious results, IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 defines that −∞&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−∞, +∞&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+∞ and &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;NaN&lt;/code&gt; for any &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; (including &lt;code&gt;NaN&lt;/code&gt;).

===Recommended functions and predicates===
* &lt;code&gt;copysign(x,y)&lt;/code&gt; returns x with the sign of y, so &lt;code&gt;abs(x)&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;copysign(x,1.0)&lt;/code&gt;. This is one of the few operations which operates on a NaN in a way resembling arithmetic. The function &lt;code&gt;copysign&lt;/code&gt; is new in the C99 standard.
* &amp;minus;x returns x with the sign reversed. This is different from 0&amp;minus;x in some cases, notably when x is 0. So &amp;minus;(0) is &amp;minus;0, but the sign of 0&amp;minus;0 depends on the rounding mode.
* &lt;code&gt;scalb(y, N)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;logb(x)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;finite(x)&lt;/code&gt; a [[Predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] for "x is a finite value", equivalent to &amp;minus;Inf &lt; x &lt; Inf
* &lt;code&gt;isnan(x)&lt;/code&gt; a predicate for "x is a NaN", equivalent to "x ≠ x"
* &lt;code&gt;x &lt;&gt; y&lt;/code&gt; which turns out to have different exception behavior than NOT(x = y).
* &lt;code&gt;unordered(x, y)&lt;/code&gt; is true when "x is unordered with y", i.e., either x or y is a NaN.
* &lt;code&gt;class(x)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;nextafter(x,y)&lt;/code&gt; returns the next representable value from x in the direction towards y

=={{anchor|P754}}History==
In 1976 [[Intel]] began planning to produce a floating point coprocessor. John Palmer, the manager of the effort, persuaded them that they should try to develop a standard for all their floating point operations. [[William Kahan]] was hired as a consultant; he had helped improve the accuracy of [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s calculators.  Kahan initially recommended that the floating point base be decimal&lt;ref&gt;W. Kahan 2003, pers. comm. to [[Mike Cowlishaw]] and others after an IEEE 754 meeting{{rs|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the hardware design of the coprocessor was too far along to make that change.

The work within Intel worried other vendors, who set up a standardization effort to ensure a 'level playing field'. Kahan attended the second IEEE 754 standards working group meeting, held in November 1977. Here, he received permission from Intel to put forward a draft proposal based on the standard arithmetic part of their design for a coprocessor. The arguments over [[gradual underflow]] lasted until 1981 when an expert hired by [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] to assess it sided against the dissenters.

Even before it was approved, the draft standard had been implemented by a number of manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/754story.html|title=An Interview with the Old Man of Floating-Point| author=Charles Severance |author-link=Charles Severance |date=20 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Connexions |url=http://cnx.org/content/m32770/latest/ |title=History of IEEE Floating-Point Format|author=Charles Severance |author-link=Charles Severance}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intel 8087]], which was announced in 1980, was the first chip to implement the draft standard.

[[Image:AberdeenBestiaryFolio004vChristInMajesty.jpg|thumb|250px|In the strictest definition of illuminated manuscript, only manuscripts with gold or silver, like this [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] of [[Christ in Majesty]] from the [[Aberdeen Bestiary]] (folio 4v), would be considered illuminated.]]
[[Image:Meister des Maréchal de Boucicaut 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The decoration of this page from a French [[Book of Hours]], c. 1400, includes a miniature, initials and borders]]

An '''illuminated manuscript''' is a [[manuscript]] in which the text is supplemented with such decoration as [[initial]]s, borders ([[marginalia]]) and [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature illustrations]]. In the strictest definition, the term refers only to manuscripts decorated with either gold or silver; but in both common usage and modern scholarship, the term refers to any decorated or illustrated manuscript from Western traditions. Comparable Far Eastern and Mesoamerican works are described as painted. [[Islam]]ic manuscripts may be referred to as illuminated, illustrated or painted, though using essentially the same techniques as Western works. 

The earliest extant substantive illuminated manuscripts are from the period 400 to 600, produced in the [[Kingdom of the Ostrogoths]] and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Their significance lies not only in their inherent artistic and historical value, but also in the maintenance of a link of literacy offered by non-illuminated texts. Had it not been for the [[monastic]] scribes of [[Late Antiquity]], most literature of Greece and Rome would have perished. As it was, the patterns of textual survivals were shaped by their usefulness to the severely constricted literate group of Christians. Illumination of manuscripts, as a way of aggrandizing ancient documents, aided their preservation and informative value in an era when new ruling classes were no longer literate, at least in the language used in the manuscripts.

The majority of extant manuscripts are from the [[Middle Ages]], although many survive from the [[Renaissance]], along with a very limited number from Late Antiquity. The majority are of a religious nature. Especially from the 13th century onward, an increasing number of secular texts were illuminated. Most illuminated manuscripts were created as [[codex|codices]], which had superseded [[scroll]]s. A very few illuminated fragments survive on [[papyrus]], which does not last nearly as long as [[vellum]] or [[parchment]]. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on parchment (most commonly of [[calfskin|calf]], sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts important enough to illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called vellum.

Beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]], manuscripts began to be produced on paper.&lt;ref&gt;The untypically early 11th century [[Missal of Silos]] is from Spain, near to Muslim paper manufacturing centres in [[Al-Andaluz]]. Textual manuscripts on paper become increasingly common, but the more expensive parchment was mostly used for illuminated manuscripts until the end of the period.&lt;/ref&gt; Very early printed books were sometimes produced with spaces left for [[rubric]]s and miniatures, or were given illuminated initials, or decorations in the margin, but the introduction of printing rapidly led to the decline of illumination. Illuminated manuscripts continued to be produced in the early 16th century but in much smaller numbers, mostly for the very wealthy. They are among the most common items to survive from the Middle Ages; many thousands survive. They are also the best surviving specimens of medieval painting, and the best preserved. Indeed, for many areas and time periods, they are the only surviving examples of painting.

==History==
{{main|History of miniature (illuminated manuscript)}}
Art historians classify illuminated manuscripts into their historic periods and types, including (but not limited to) Late Antique, [[Insular art|Insular]], [[Carolingian art|Carolingian manuscripts]], [[Ottonian art|Ottonian manuscripts]], [[Romanesque art|Romanesque manuscripts]], [[Gothic art|Gothic manuscripts]], and [[Renaissance art|Renaissance manuscripts]]. There are a few examples from later periods. The type of book most often heavily and richly illuminated, sometimes known as a "display book", varied between periods. In the first millennium, these were most likely to be [[Gospel Book]]s, such as the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] and the [[Book of Kells]]. The Romanesque period saw the creation of many large illuminated complete [[Bible]]s – one in Sweden requires three librarians to lift it. Many [[Psalter]]s were also heavily illuminated in both this and the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]]. Single cards or posters of [[vellum]], [[leather]] or paper were in wider circulation with short stories or legends on them about the lives of saints, chivalry knights or other mythological figures, even criminal, social or miraculous occurrences; popular events much freely used by story tellers and itinerant actors to support their plays. Finally, the [[Book of Hours]], very commonly the personal devotional book of a wealthy layperson, was often richly illuminated in the Gothic period. Other books, both liturgical and not, continued to be illuminated at all periods. 

The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] world produced manuscripts in its own style, versions of which spread to other Orthodox and Eastern Christian areas. The [[Islamic Golden Age|Muslim World]] and in particular the Iberian Peninsula, with their [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|traditions of literacy]] uninterrupted by the Middle Ages, were instrumental in delivering ancient classic works to the growing intellectual circles and [[universities]] of Western Europe all through the 12th century, as books were produced there in large numbers and on [[History of paper|paper]] for the first time in Europe, and with them full treatises on the sciences, especially astrology and medicine where illumination was required to have profuse and accurate representations with the text.

The Gothic period, which generally saw an increase in the production of these artifacts, also saw more secular works such as [[chronicle]]s and works of literature illuminated. Wealthy people began to build up personal libraries; [[Philip the Bold]] probably had the largest personal library of his time in the mid-15th century, is estimated to have had about 600 illuminated manuscripts, whilst a number of his friends and relations had several dozen.

[[File:Books in the monastery museum (5494269533).jpg|thumb|Illuminated manuscripts housed in the 16th-century [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox church]] of [[Ura Kidane Mehret]], [[Zege Peninsula]], [[Lake Tana]], [[Ethiopia]]]]
Up to the 12th century, most manuscripts were produced in monasteries in order to add to the library or after receiving a [[Commission (art)|commission]] from a wealthy patron. Larger monasteries often contained separate areas for the [[monks]] who specialized in the production of manuscripts called a [[scriptorium]]. Within the walls of a scriptorium were individualized areas where a monk could sit and work on a manuscript without being disturbed by his fellow brethren. If no scriptorium was available, then “separate little rooms were assigned to book copying; they were situated in such a way that each scribe had to himself a window open to the cloister walk.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1962"&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The separation of these monks from the rest of the cloister indicates just how revered these monks were within their society.

By the 14th century, the [[cloisters]] of monks writing in the scriptorium had almost fully given way to commercial urban scriptoria, especially in Paris, Rome and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, 45&lt;/ref&gt; While the process of creating an illuminated manuscript did not change, the move from monasteries to commercial settings was a radical step. Demand for manuscripts grew to an extent that Monastic libraries began to employ secular scribes and illuminators.&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, 57&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals often lived close to the monastery and, in instances, dressed as monks whenever they entered the monastery, but were allowed to leave at the end of the day. In reality, illuminators were often well known and acclaimed and many of their identities have survived.&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

First, the manuscript was “sent to the [[rubricator]], who added (in red or other colors) the titles, [[headlines]], the initials of chapters and sections, the notes and so on; and then – if the book was to be illustrated – it was sent to the illuminator.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1962"/&gt; In the case of manuscripts that were sold commercially, the writing would “undoubtedly have been discussed initially between the patron and the scribe (or the scribe’s agent,) but by the time that the written gathering were sent off to the illuminator there was no longer any scope for innovation.”&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, Christopher. Medieval Craftsmen: Scribes and Illuminations. Buffalo: University of Toronto, 1992. p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
[[File:Roman de la Rose f. 28r (Author at writing desk).jpg|thumb|The author of a manuscript at his writing desk. 14th Century]]
Illumination was a complex and frequently costly process. It was usually reserved for special books: an altar Bible, for example. Wealthy people often had richly illuminated "[[book of hours|books of hours]]" made, which set down prayers appropriate for various times in the [[liturgy|liturgical day]].

In the early Middle Ages, most books were produced in monasteries, whether for their own use, for presentation, or for a commission. However, commercial [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] grew up in large cities, especially [[School of Paris|Paris]], and in Italy and the Netherlands, and by the late 14th century there was a significant industry producing manuscripts, including agents who would take long-distance commissions, with details of the heraldry of the buyer and the saints of personal interest to him (for the calendar of a Book of hours). By the end of the period, many of the painters were women, perhaps especially in Paris.

=== Text ===
The text was usually written before the manuscripts were illuminated. Sheets of [[parchment]] or [[vellum parchment|vellum]] were cut down to the appropriate size. After the general layout of the page was planned (including the initial capitals and borders), the page was lightly ruled with a pointed stick, and the scribe went to work with ink-pot and either sharpened [[quill]] feather or reed pen. The script depended on local customs and tastes. The sturdy Roman letters of the early [[Middle Ages]] gradually gave way to scripts such as [[Uncial]] and half-Uncial, especially in the [[British Isles]], where distinctive scripts such as [[insular majuscule]] and [[insular minuscule]] developed. Stocky, richly textured [[blackletter]] was first seen around the 13th century and was particularly popular in the later Middle Ages.

Prior to the days of such careful planning, “A typical black-letter page of these [[Gothic art|Gothic]] years would show a page in which the lettering was cramped and crowded into a format dominated by huge ornamented capitals that descended from uncial forms or by illustrations.”&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Donald M. The Art of Written Forms: The Theory and Practice of Calligraphy. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc, 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent such poorly made manuscripts and illuminations from occurring a script was typically supplied first, “and blank spaces were left for the decoration. This pre-supposes very careful planning by the scribe even before he put pen to parchment.” If the [[scribe]] and the illuminator were separate labors the planning period allowed for adequate space to be given to each individual.

=== The process of illumination ===

[[Image:Thomas Becket Murder.JPG|thumb|A 13th-century manuscript illumination, the earliest known depiction of [[Thomas Becket]]'s assassination]]
The following steps outline the detailed labor involved to create the illuminations of one page of a manuscript:
# [[Silverpoint]] drawing of the design were executed
# Burnished gold dots applied
# The application of modulating colors
# Continuation of the previous three steps in addition to the outlining of marginal figures
# The penning of a rinceaux appearing in the border of a page
# The final step, the marginal figures are painted&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, Robert G. "Stages of Execution: Procedures of Illumination as Revealed in an Unfinished Book of Hours." International Center of Medieval Art 17.1 (1978): 61–70. JSTOR.org. Web. 17 April 2010. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/766713&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The illumination and decoration was normally planned at the inception of the work, and space reserved for it. However, the text was usually written before illumination began. In the Early Medieval period the text and illumination were often done by the same people, normally monks, but by the [[High Middle Ages]] the roles were typically separated, except for routine initials and flourishes, and by at least the 14th century there were secular workshops producing manuscripts, and by the beginning of the 15th century these were producing most of the best work, and were commissioned even by monasteries. When the text was complete, the illustrator set to work. Complex designs were planned out beforehand, probably on wax tablets, the sketch pad of the era. The design was then traced or drawn onto the vellum (possibly with the aid of pinpricks or other markings, as in the case of the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]). Many incomplete manuscripts survive from most periods, giving us a good idea of working methods.

At all times, most manuscripts did not have images in them. In the early Middle Ages, manuscripts tend to either be display books with very full illumination, or manuscripts for study with at most a few decorated initials and flourishes. By the Romanesque period many more manuscripts had decorated or [[historiated initial]]s, and manuscripts essentially for study often contained some images, often not in color. This trend intensified in the Gothic period, when most manuscripts had at least decorative flourishes in places, and a much larger proportion had images of some sort. Display books of the Gothic period in particular had very elaborate decorated borders of foliate patterns, often with small [[drolleries]]. A Gothic page might contain several areas and types of decoration: a miniature in a frame, a historiated initial beginning a passage of text, and a border with drolleries. Often different artists worked on the different parts of the decoration.

=== Use of color in illuminated manuscripts ===
While the use of gold is by far one of the most captivating features of illuminated manuscripts, the bold use of varying colors provided multiple layers of dimension to the illumination. From a religious perspective, "the diverse colors wherewith the book is illustrated, not unworthily represent the multiple grace of heavenly wisdom."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1962"/&gt; While religious authors view themselves as instilling a part of God's vast glory on the work, many illustrations can be linked to "the history of the texts that were required to be illustrated and the needs and tastes of the readers of those manuscripts."&lt;ref name="jrank1"&gt;"Manuscript." http://arts.jrank.org/pages/9716/Manuscript.html. Web. 17 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Color brought the images on the page to life and captivated the readers. Without color the impact of the image would have been completely lost.

=== Paints ===
The medieval artist's palette was broad; a partial list of pigments is given below. In addition, unlikely-sounding substances such as urine and earwax were used to prepare pigments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanities.uci.edu/spanishandportuguese/spanish/medievaliberia/manuscript_glossary_O-P.html Iberian manuscripts (pigments)] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20030329222834/http://www.humanities.uci.edu/spanishandportuguese/spanish/medievaliberia/manuscript_glossary_O-P.html |date=29 March 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--True, check this and other references before taking this as a joke!--&gt;

=== Gilding ===
[[Image:Sakramentarz tyniecki 02.jpg|thumb|The 11th-century ''Tyniec Sacramentary'' was written with gold on a purple background. [[National Library of Poland]], [[Warsaw]].]]
A manuscript is not considered illuminated unless one or many illuminations contained [[gold foil]] or was brushed with gold specks, a process known as ''burnishing''. The inclusion of gold alludes to many different possibilities for the text. If the text is of religious nature the gold is a sign of exalting the text. In the early centuries of Christianity, “[[Gospel]] manuscripts were sometimes written entirely in gold.”&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, Christopher. The British Library Guide to Manuscript Illumination: History and Techniques. Toronto: University of Toronto, 2001. Print,52.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from adding flashy decoration to the text, scribes during the time considered themselves to be praising God with their use of gold. In one particular instance, “The life of Christ executed on gold backgrounds with much greater richness in the midst of innumerable scenes of the chase, tourneys, games and grotesque subjects.”&lt;ref name="newadvent1910"&gt;Brehier, Louis. “Illuminated Manuscripts.” The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol.9. New York: Robert Appelton Company, 1910. 17 April 2010 http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09620a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, gold was used if a patron who had commissioned a book to be written wished to display the vastness of his riches. Eventually, the addition of gold to manuscripts became so frequent, “that its value as a barometer of status with the manuscript was degraded.”&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, Christopher. Medieval Craftsmen: Scribes and Illuminations. Buffalo: University of Toronto, 1992. Print,49.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period the price of gold had become so cheap that its inclusion in an illuminated manuscript accounted for only a tenth of the cost of production.&lt;ref name="Brehier"&gt;Brehier, Louis. “Illuminated Manuscripts.” The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol.9. New York: Robert Appelton Company, 1910. 17 April 2010 http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09620a.htm, page 45.&lt;/ref&gt; By adding richness and depth to the manuscript, the use of gold in illuminations created pieces of art that are still valued today.

The application of gold leaf or dust to an illumination is a very detailed process that only the most skilled illuminators can undertake and successfully achieve. The first detail an illuminator considered when dealing with gold was whether to use [[gold leaf]] or specks of gold that could be applied with a brush. When working with gold leaf the pieces would be hammered and thinned until they were “thinner than the thinnest paper.”&lt;ref name="Brehier" /&gt; The use of this type of leaf allowed for numerous areas of the text to be outlined in gold. There were several ways of applying gold to an illumination one of the most popular included mixing the gold with stag’s glue and then “pour it into water and dissolve it with your finger.”&lt;ref&gt;Blondheim, D.S. "An Old Portuguese Work on Manuscript Illumination." The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Series 19.2 (1928): 97–135. JSTOR. Web. 17 April 2010. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1451766&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the gold was soft and malleable in the water it was ready to be applied to the page. Illuminators had to be very careful when applying gold leaf to the manuscript. Gold leaf is able to "adhere to any pigment which had already been laid, ruining the design, and secondly the action of burnishing it is vigorous and runs the risk of smudging any painting already around it."

== Patrons of illumination ==
Monasteries produced manuscripts for their own use; heavily illuminated ones tended to be reserved for liturgical use in the early period, while the monastery library held plainer texts. In the early period manuscripts were often commissioned by rulers for their own personal use or as diplomatic gifts, and many old manuscripts continued to be given in this way, even into the [[Early Modern]] period. Especially after the book of hours became popular, wealthy individuals commissioned works as a sign of status within the community, sometimes including [[donor portrait]]s or [[heraldry]]: "In a scene from the New Testament, Christ would be shown larger than an apostle, who would be bigger than a mere bystander in the picture, while the humble donor of the painting or the artist himself might appear as a tiny figure in the corner."&lt;ref name="jrank1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 1 | publisher = University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division | isbn = 0-8020-8173-8 | last = Hamel | first = Christopher de | title = The British Library Guide to Manuscript Illumination: History and Techniques | page = 20 | date = 29 December 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossH.asp|title = Heraldry|date = n.d.|accessdate = 14 December 2015|website = Glossary for Illuminated Manuscripts|publisher = British Library|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The calendar was also personalized, recording the feast days of local or family saints. By the end of the Middle Ages many manuscripts were produced for distribution through a network of agents, and blank spaces might be reserved for the appropriate heraldry to be added locally by the buyer.

Displaying the amazing detail and richness of a text, the addition of illumination was never an afterthought. The inclusion of illumination is twofold, it added value to the work, but more importantly it provides pictures for the illiterate members of society to "make the reading seem more vivid and perhaps more credible.”&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Susan. "Manuscript Illumination in Northern Europe". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/manu/hd_manu.htm (October 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indian calligraphy''' is the [[Culture of India|Indian]] tradition of [[calligraphy]], or artistic writing. The art form has served multiple purposes since its inception in the second century BCE, including the duplication of religious texts and as a form of basic communication.

== History ==
===Early calligraphy (2nd century BCE-6th century CE)===
Beginning in the 2nd century AD, Indic language was transferred using [[Birch bark manuscript|birch bark]] as a writing surface. Locally, the birch bark was called Bhojpatra in [[India]] - patra meaning leaf/bark/sheet in [[Sanskrit]]. Palm leaves were used as a substitute to paper, even after paper was available for Indic manuscripts. The leaves were commonly used because they were a good surface for pen writing, which created the delicate and decorative handwriting that is known as calligraphy today. Both sides of these leaves were used and they were stacked on top of each other. People then created holes on the leaves and held them together by string, thus creating the early Indian manuscripts, common in Southeast Asia at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indic Calligraphy|last=Anderson|first=D.M.|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages (6th century-16th century)===
Indian calligraphy took off starting around 500 AD when Indian traders, colonists, military adventurers, [[Bhikku|Buddhist monks]] and missionaries brought the [[Indic script]] to Central Asia from [[South East Asia]]. Different concepts and ideas were being created throughout the late 400s to late 1400s, in a 1000-year span. The [[Gilgit]] scripts are the earliest notable form of calligraphy in India that date back to the 5th and 6th centuries. The earliest painted covers of manuscripts were created between the 7th and 9th centuries, and the earliest illustrated manuscript in South Asia was not formed until around the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred Calligraphy of the East|last=Stevens|first=John|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=0877734585|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Qutb Minar Minaret Delhi India.jpg|160px|thumb|Inscriptions in the [[Kufic]] style of [[calligraphy]] form regular bands throughout the [[Qutb Minar]], [[Delhi]], built 1192 CE]]

The languages of South East Asia were influenced by Indic language and culture. The languages that were created came in the form of the basic internal structure, the arrangement and construction of syllabic units, manner of representation of characters, and the direction of writing (left to right). Before this left to right reading, the technique of [[Palm-leaf manuscript|Pothi]] was utilized, which is the format of a book that is written vertically. This was useful for the illustrations made in these early manuscripts. [[Persian people|Persian]] influence in Indian calligraphy gave rise to a unique and influential blend in Indian calligraphy, although a number of different calligraphic traditions existed in India already, and Indic scripts were fundamentally different from scripts used in Arabic and Persian traditions. The notable achievements of the [[Mughal era|Mughals]] included some of their fine manuscripts, which were usually autobiographies and chronicles of the noble class. They were initially written in flowing [[Persian language|Persian]] script, which was one of the main forms of communication during this time, and which showed a multi-directionality and mutuality of influence on Indic calligraphers.

From the 16th century onwards [[Sikhism]] played a key role in the history of Indian calligraphy. Sikhs have traditionally handwritten their holy book, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], and furnished it with illumination. [[Sikh]] calligrapher [[Pratap Singh Giani]] (1855–1920) is known for one of the first definitive translations of Sikh scriptures into [[English language|English]].[[Image:Asokan brahmi pillar edict.jpg|thumb|right|184x184px|A fragment of [[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashoka's 6th pillar edict]].]]

=== Modern Period (16th century-today) ===
There was a bigger goal to this style of language than just to communicate with one another. There was no one true form of [[communication]] before this was created, and calligraphy helped to guide community members to connect in more than one aspect of life, that was not just language. A rich heritage of calligraphy was embraced as this was a time before [[printing]] technology was accessible to Indian counties. This brought people closer together as they began to communicate in the same ways. While it may be used as an art form today, it was essential for communication before the 16th century.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Features of Indian calligraphy ==
[[Religious text]]s are the most frequent vehicle for calligraphy in India. [[Monastic]] Buddhist communities had members trained in calligraphy and shared responsibility for duplicating sacred scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-Aryan Languages|last=Salomon|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0195099843|location=Oxford, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jainism|Jaina]] traders incorporated illustrated manuscripts celebrating Jaina saints. These manuscripts were produced using inexpensive material, like palm leave and birch, with fine calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Art|last=Mitter|first=Partha|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Oxford, New York|pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48192">The '''intentional stance''' is a term coined by [[philosopher]] [[Daniel Dennett]] for the level of [[abstraction]] in which we view the behavior of an entity in terms of [[mental properties]]. It is part of a theory of [[mental content]] proposed by Dennett, which provides the underpinnings of his later works on [[free will]], [[consciousness]], [[folk psychology]], and [[evolution]].

{{Quote|text=Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do.|sign=Daniel Dennett|source=''The Intentional Stance'', p. 17}}

== Dennett and intentionality ==
Dennett (1971, p.&amp;nbsp;87) states that he took the concept of "[[intentionality]]" from the work of the German philosopher [[Franz Brentano]].&lt;ref&gt;In his second edition (1973/1924, pp. 180–81), Brentano added this explanation of "intentional" to his 1911 edition: "This expression had been misunderstood in that some people thought it had to do with intention and the pursuit of a goal. In view of this, I might have done better to avoid it altogether. Instead of the term 'intentional' the Scholastics very frequently used the expression 'objective'. This has to do with the fact that something is an object for the mentally active subject, and, as such, is present in some manner in his consciousness, whether it is merely thought of or also desired, shunned, etc. I preferred the expression 'intentional' because I thought there would be an even greater danger of being misunderstood if I had described the object of thought as 'objectively existing', for modern day thinkers use this expression to refer to what really exists as opposed to 'mere subjective appearances'."&lt;/ref&gt; When clarifying the distinction between mental phenomena (viz., mental activity) and physical phenomena, Brentano (p.&amp;nbsp;97) argued that, in contrast with physical phenomena,&lt;ref&gt;In addition to cogitations (such as judgement, recollection and inference) and emotions (such as joy and sorrow and fear), Brentano (op.cit. p. 79) includes things such as "hearing a sound, seeing a colored object, feeling warm or cold" in his category of physical phenomena.&lt;/ref&gt; the "distinguishing characteristic of all mental phenomena"&lt;ref&gt;By contrast, Brentano (p. 80) includes things such as "a color... a chord which I hear, warmth, cold, odor which I sense" in his category of mental phenomena.&lt;/ref&gt; was "the reference to something as an object" – a characteristic he called "''intentional inexistence''".&lt;ref&gt;Note that, whilst the term "inexistence" appears haphazardly right throughout the text of Bretano's work as both '''''in-existence''''' and ''''''inexistence''''', it very clearly always carries the "inherence" meaning (i.e., the fact or condition of existing in something), rather than the "non-existence" meaning (i.e., the fact or condition of not existing).&lt;/ref&gt; Dennett constantly speaks of the "''[[aboutness]]''" of ''intentionality''; for example: "the aboutness of the pencil marks composing a shopping list is derived from the intentions of the person whose list it is" (Dennett, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;240).

[[John Searle]] (1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;85) stresses that "competence" in predicting/explaining human behaviour involves being able to both recognize others as "''intentional''" beings, and interpret others' minds as having "intentional states" (e.g., beliefs and desires):
:"The primary evolutionary role of the mind is to relate us in certain ways to the environment, and especially to other people. My subjective states relate me to the rest of the world, and the general name of that relationship is "intentionality." These subjective states include beliefs and desires, intentions and perceptions, as well as loves and hates, fears and hopes. "Intentionality," to repeat, is the general term for all the various forms by which the mind can be directed at, or be about, or of, objects and states of affairs in the world." (p.85)&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1999, pp. 85–86) clarifies his usage: "'''''Intentionality''''' is an unfortunate word, and like a lot of unfortunate words in philosophy, we owe it to the German-speaking philosophers. The word suggests that intentionality, in the sense of directedness, must always have some connection with 'intending' in the sense in which, for example, I intend to go to the movies tonight. (German has no problem with this because '''''Intentionalität'''''' does not sound like '''''Absicht'''''', the word for intention in the ordinary sense of intending to go to the movies.) So we have to keep in mind that in English intending is just one form of intentionality among many.&lt;br/&gt; Foss and Bow (1986, p. 94) present a far more [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.-oriented]] view:&lt;br/&gt;"We assume that people understand the actions of others by viewing those actions as purposive, as goal directed. People use their knowledge of human intentionality, of the types of goals people have and of the types of plans they devise in service of those goals, to understand action sequences that are described in narratives or observed directly. Many recent approaches to comprehension emphasize the role of goal planning knowledge when understanding narratives and conversations, and when remembering observed sequences and goal directed actions. According to these approaches, understanding involves inferring the intentions (i.e. the plans and goals) of the characters, speakers, or actors. Such inferences are ubiquitous because narratives frequently provide only sketchy descriptions of the character's actions and goals; speakers rarely state their intentions directly; and observers rarely see all the events preceding or following the action to be explained. Therefore, people are forced to use their general knowledge of human intentionality to fill in the missing information; they do this by generating expectations and drawing inferences in order to come up with a plan that explains an actor's behavior. Although the importance of this type of knowledge for understanding natural discourse and action sequences has been recognized, only recently have cognitive scientists begun examining the psychological processes involved in drawing inferences about human intentionality..."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dennett (1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49), [[folk psychology]] provides a systematic, "reason-giving explanation" for a particular action, and an account of the historical origins of that action, based on deeply embedded assumptions  about the agent;&lt;ref&gt;Because we use folk psychology effortlessly all the time to ''systematically predict'' actions, and because this way of thinking about things seems to be so very effective – Fodor (1987, p. 3) speaks of its "extraordinary predictive power" – Dennett is certain that the practice of treating others as rational agents must have evolved and developed over time: "we treat each other as if we were rational agents, and this myth – for surely we are not all that rational – works very well because we are pretty rational" (p. 50). Siegert (2001, p. 183), agrees: "Evolutionary psychology argues that the ability to form a representation of what another human is thinking is an ability that has been acquired and developed through natural selection. The ability to interpret other people's facial expressions, their body language, and their tone of voice, has obvious advantages for survival. In earlier environments, our ancestors had to be able determine who was a friend and who was an enemy, who was a potential mate and who was not. The ability to distinguish between facial expressions associated with suspicion and curiosity, fear and anger, or disgust and sadness, may have been the difference between life and death. In modern society we also rely on this ability for surviving socially, if not literally. Our ability to accurately express our emotions, to know how and when to express them, to know when to conceal our emotions, and to be able read and interpret the emotions of other people are skills that impact hugely on our ability to form lasting relationships, breed and raise healthy children, and gain high status in our careers" (p. 183).&lt;/ref&gt; namely that:
:(a) the agent's action was entirely rational;&lt;ref&gt;Dennett stresses how research into artificial intelligence has shown just how rational humans actually are: "Even the most sophisticated AI programs stumble blindly into misinterpretations and misunderstandings that even small children reliably evade without a second thought" (1987, p. 52).&lt;/ref&gt;
:(b) the agent's action was entirely reasonable (in the prevailing circumstances);
:(c) the agent held certain ''beliefs'';&lt;ref&gt;Note that it is irrelevant whether the agent actually holds these particular beliefs or not; the critical feature is that the observer ascribes them to the agent. The intentional stance involves an observer amassing a constellation of subjective, observer-centred assumptions, unique to that specific observer, that are expressed in the form of a set of supposed beliefs and desires which are attributed to (and projected upon) the object of that observation ''in order to explain something to the observer''. The observer is not trying to objectively determine the agent's actual state of mind. His only need is to be able to represent the agent's behaviour to himself in such a way that he can respond to the agent's behaviour. Consequently, these attributions rarely describe any actual belief or desire an agent might maintain at any time; and the objective truth of the observer's subjective assumptions about the agent's "inner life" is entirely irrelevant – always provided, of course, that his response to the agent's behaviour has been appropriate.&lt;/ref&gt;
:(d) the agent ''desired'' certain things; and
:(e) the agent's future action could be systematically predicted from the ''beliefs'' and ''desires'' so ascribed.

This approach is also consistent with the earlier work of [[Fritz Heider]] and [[Marianne Simmel]], whose joint study revealed that, when subjects were presented with an animated display of 2-dimensional shapes, they were inclined to ascribe intentions to the shapes.&lt;ref&gt;See Heider &amp; Simmel (1944); the animation used in the experiment is at "youtube.com/watch?v=n9TWwG4SFWQ".&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, Dennett (1987, p.&amp;nbsp;52) argues that, based on our fixed personal views of what all humans ought to believe, desire and do, we predict (or explain) the beliefs, desires and actions of others "by calculating in a normative system";&lt;ref&gt;In other words, humans have a propensity to systematically think as follows: '''X''' has performed action '''A''' because they believe '''B''', and desires '''D''', and (on the basis of their desire for '''D''', and their belief that '''B''' is how things obtain in the real world) '''X''' has chosen to '''A''', with the intention of achieving goal '''G''' (which, as they understand things, will produce outcome '''D'''). This deep desire to eschew disorder and make things systematic has a parallel in the way that humans assess the concept of "randomness". In many circumstances, according to Falk and Konold (1997; 1998), an individual's concept of what is "random" is, in fact, far from it – and this "''subjective randomness''" is, often, far more disordered than a truly random sequence. Lisanby and Lockhead (1991), also differentiate between subjective randomness and genuine randomness (upon which they which they bestow the tautologous title of "''stochastic randomness''").

:"That subjective randomness results from people's failure to make sense of their observations is not a new idea. Piaget and Inhelder [viz., 1951/1975] attribute the origin of the idea of chance in children to their realizing the impossibility of predicting oncoming events or finding causal explanations. The experience of randomness is thus construed as an admission of failure of our intellectual operations" (Falk and Konold, 1988, p. 658).&lt;/ref&gt; and, driven by the reasonable assumption that all humans are rational beings – who do ''have'' specific beliefs and desires and do ''act'' on the basis of those beliefs and desires in order to get what they want – these predictions/explanations are based on four simple rules:

# The agent's ''beliefs'' are those a rational individual ought to have (i.e., given their "perceptual capacities", "epistemic needs" and "biography");&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne (2001, pp. 39–40) argues that one of the most important features of beliefs is that they are involuntary: "Belief is a passive state; believing is a state in which you are, it is not a matter of you doing something. And it is an involuntary state, a state in which you find yourself and which you cannot change at will at an instant. I believe that today is Tuesday, that I am now in Oxford, that Aquinas died in AD 1274, and so on and so on. I cannot sudden-ly decide to believe that today is Monday, that I am now in Italy, or that Aquinas lived in the eighteenth century. That belief is involuntary was a claim of Locke, Leibniz, and Hume. "Belief consists", wrote Hume, "merely in a certain feeling or sentiment; in something that depends not on the will, but must arise from certain determinate causes and principles of which we are not masters."&lt;/ref&gt;
# In general, these beliefs "are both true and relevant to [their] life;&lt;ref&gt;In addressing cases where an agent's beliefs are not "both true and relevant to [their] life", Dennett (1987, p. 49) notes that "when false beliefs are attributed, special stories must be told to explain how the error resulted from the presence of features in the environment that are deceptive relative to the perceptual capacities of the system."&lt;/ref&gt;
# The agent's ''desires'' are those a rational individual ought to have (i.e., given their "biological needs", and "the most practicable means of satisfying them") in order to further their "survival" and "procreation" needs;&lt;ref&gt;Dennett also addresses the cases in which the desires are "abnormal" and remarks that "[these] 'abnormal' desires are attributable if special stories can be told" (1987, p. 49).&lt;/ref&gt; and 
# The agent's behaviour will be composed of those acts a rational individual holding those ''beliefs'' (and having those ''desires'') ought to perform.

==Dennett's three levels==
The core idea is that, when understanding, explaining, and/or predicting the behavior of an object, we can choose to view it at varying levels of abstraction. The more concrete the level, the more accurate ''in principle'' our predictions are; the more abstract, the greater the computational power we gain by zooming out and skipping over the irrelevant details.

Dennett defines three levels of abstraction, attained by adopting one of three entirely different "stances", or intellectual strategies: the physical stance; the design stance; and the intentional stance:&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D. C., (1987) "Three Kinds of Intentional Psychology", pp. 43–68 in Dennett, D. C., ''The Intentional Stance'', The MIT Press, (Cambridge), 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The most concrete is the ''physical stance'', the domain of physics and chemistry, which makes predictions from knowledge of the physical constitution of the system and the physical laws that govern its operation; and thus, given a particular set of physical laws and initial conditions, and a particular configuration, a specific future state is predicted (this could also be called the "''structure stance''").&lt;ref&gt;Perkins (1983, p. 360), refers to the results of this "'''''machine style'''''" of perception as a "'''''physicist's system'''''".&lt;/ref&gt; At this level, we are concerned with such things as mass, energy, velocity, and chemical composition. When we predict where a ball is going to land based on its current trajectory, we are taking the physical stance. Another example of this stance comes when we look at a strip made up of two types of metal bonded together and predict how it will bend as the temperature changes, based on the physical properties of the two metals.
* Somewhat more abstract is the ''design stance'', the domain of biology and engineering, which requires no knowledge of the physical constitution or the physical laws that govern a system's operation. Based on an implicit assumption that there is no malfunction in the system, predictions are made from knowledge of the purpose of the system's design (this could also be called the "''teleological stance''").&lt;ref&gt;Like Rudyard Kipling's ''Just So Stories'', the theme of the "design" category is that things are simply just that way: a parallel to the doctoral candidate in Molière's ''Le Malade imaginaire'', who, when asked why opium made people go to sleep, spoke of it having a "dormitive virtue" (a sleep-inducing factor): "If you know something about the design of an artifact, you can predict its behavior without worrying yourself about the underlying physics of its parts. Even small children can readily learn to manipulate such complicated objects as VCRs without having a clue how they work; they know just what will happen when they press a sequence of buttons, because they know what is designed to happen. They are operating from what I call the design stance" (Dennett, 1995, p. 229).&lt;/ref&gt; At this level, we are concerned with such things as purpose, function and design. When we predict that a bird will fly when it flaps its wings on the basis that wings are made for flying, we are taking the design stance. Likewise, we can understand the bimetallic strip as a particular type of thermometer, not concerning ourselves with the details of how this type of thermometer happens to work. We can also recognize the purpose that this thermometer serves inside a thermostat and even generalize to other kinds of thermostats that might use a different sort of thermometer. We can even explain the thermostat in terms of what it's good for, saying that it keeps track of the temperature and turns on the heater whenever it gets below a minimum, turning it off once it reaches a maximum.
* Most abstract is the ''intentional stance'', the domain of software and minds, which requires no knowledge of either structure or design,&lt;ref&gt;Perkins (1983, p. 360), refers to the results of this "'''''human style'''''" of perception as a "'''''pragmatist's system'''''".&lt;/ref&gt; and "[clarifies] the logic of mentalistic explanations of behaviour, their predictive power, and their relation to other forms of explanation" (Bolton &amp; Hill, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;24). Predictions are made on the basis of ''explanations'' expressed in terms of meaningful mental states; and, given the task of predicting or explaining the behaviour of a specific agent (a person, animal, corporation, artifact, nation, etc.), it is implicitly assumed that the agent will always act on the basis of its ''beliefs'' and ''desires'' in order to get precisely what it wants (this could also be called the "''folk psychology stance''").&lt;ref&gt;Observing that the term "belief" has a very wide range of meanings – and remarking that "we seldom talk about what people ''believe'', we [usually] talk about what they ''think'' and what they ''know''" – Dennett (1987, p. 46) produces a precise definition: "folk psychology has it that '''''beliefs''''' are information-bearing states of people that arise from perceptions and that, together appropriately related '''''desires''''', lead to intelligent '''''action'''''".&lt;/ref&gt; At this level, we are concerned with such things as belief, thinking and intent. When we predict that the bird will fly away because it knows the cat is coming and is afraid of getting eaten, we are taking the intentional stance. Another example would be when we predict that Mary will leave the theater and drive to the restaurant because she sees that the movie is over and is hungry.
* In 1971, Dennett also postulated that, whilst "the intentional stance ''presupposes'' neither lower stance", there may well be a fourth, higher level: a "truly moral stance toward the system" – the "''personal stance''" – which not only "presupposes the intentional stance" (viz., treats the system as ''rational'') but also "views it as a person" (1971/1978, p.&amp;nbsp;240).

A key point is that switching to a higher level of abstraction has its risks as well as its benefits. For example, when we view both a bimetallic strip and a tube of mercury as thermometers, we can lose track of the fact that they differ in accuracy and temperature range, leading to false predictions as soon as the thermometer is used outside the circumstances for which it was designed. The actions of a mercury thermometer heated to 500&amp;nbsp;°C can no longer be predicted on the basis of treating it as a thermometer; we have to sink down to the physical stance to understand it as a melted and boiled piece of junk.  For that matter, the "actions" of a dead bird are not predictable in terms of beliefs or desires.

Even when there is no immediate error, a higher-level stance can simply fail to be useful. If we were to try to understand the thermostat at the level of the intentional stance, ascribing to it beliefs about how hot it is and a desire to keep the temperature just right, we would gain no traction over the problem as compared to staying at the design stance, but we would generate theoretical commitments that expose us to absurdities, such as the possibility of the thermostat not being in the mood to work today because the weather is so nice. Whether to take a particular stance, then, is determined by how successful that stance is when applied.

Dennett argues that it is best to understand human behavior at the level of the intentional stance, without making any specific commitments to any deeper reality of the artifacts of [[folk psychology]]. In addition to the controversy inherent in this, there is also some dispute about the extent to which Dennett is committing to [[Philosophical realism|realism]] about mental properties. Initially, Dennett's interpretation was seen as leaning more towards [[instrumentalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Papineau (1995) defines instrumentalism as: "The doctrine that scientific theories are not true descriptions of an unobservable reality, but merely useful instruments which enable us to order and anticipate the observable world": a parallel to Perkins' "pragmatist's system" (Perkins, 1983, p. 360).&lt;/ref&gt; but over the years, as this idea has been used to support more extensive theories of [[consciousness]], it has been taken as being more like Realism. His own words hint at something in the middle, as he suggests that the self is as real as a center of gravity, "an [[abstract object]], a theorist's fiction", but [[operationalism|operationally]] valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a way of thinking about things, Dennett's intentional stance is entirely consistent with everyday commonsense understanding; and, thus, it meets [[Eleanor Rosch]]'s (1978, p. 28) criterion of the "maximum information with the least cognitive effort". Rosch argues that, implicit within any system of categorization, are the assumptions that:
:(a) the major purpose of any system of categorization is to reduce the randomness of the universe by providing "maximum information with the least cognitive effort", and
:(b) the real world is structured and systematic, rather than being arbitrary or unpredictable. Thus, if a particular way of categorizing information does, indeed, "provide maximum information with the least cognitive effort", ''it can only do so because the structure of that particular system of categories corresponds with the perceived structure of the real world''.

Also, the intentional stance meets the criteria Dennett specified (1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;50–51) for algorithms:
:(1) ''Substrate Neutrality'': It is a "mechanism" that produces results regardless of the material used to perform the procedure ("the power of the procedure is due to its logical structure, not the causal powers of the materials used in the instantiation").
:(2) ''Underlying Mindlessness'': Each constituent step, and each transition between each step, is so utterly simple, that they can be performed by a "dutiful idiot".
:(3) ''Guaranteed Results'': "Whatever it is that an algorithm does, it always does it, if it is executed without misstep. An algorithm is a foolproof recipe."

== Variants of Dennett's three stances ==
The general notion of a three level system was widespread in the late 1970s/early 1980s; for example, when discussing the mental representation of information from a [[cognitive psychology]] perspective, Glass and his colleagues (1979, p.&amp;nbsp;24) distinguished three important aspects of representation:
:(a) the ''content'' ("what is being represented");
:(b) the ''code'' ("the format of the representation");&lt;ref&gt;Glass et al. (1979, p. 3) distinguish between ''content'' and ''code'' as follows: "A simple English word like '''''cat''''' is a representation. It represents a certain '''''concept''''' or idea, namely the concept of a furry house-hold pet that purrs. Note that this same concept can be represented in many different ways. We could use a picture of a cat to represent the concept. We could translate cat into Spanish and represent it by '''''gato'''''. We could represent it in Morse code by a series of dots and dashes, or in Braille by a certain tactile pattern. Across all these examples the information being represented stays the same. This common information is called the content of the representation. Each different way the information can be expressed is called a representational code. So the words '''''cat''''' and '''''gato''''' represent the same content, but in different codes (i.e., written English vs. written Spanish). In contrast the words '''''cat''''' and '''''lawyer''''' represent different contents, but in the same code (written English)."&lt;/ref&gt; and
:(c) the ''medium'' ("the physical realization of the code").&lt;ref&gt;Glass et al. (1979, p. 3) distinguish between ''code'' and ''media'' as follows: "Listen to someone singing. Then listen to a recording of the same person singing the same song. The two sounds would probably be virtually identical. Yet the sound would be produced in very different ways – in one case by human vocal cords, in the other by electronic components. These are two different '''''media''''' for producing the same auditory '''''code'''''." Glass et al. also make the point that "cognitive psychology primarily explores representational codes" (p. 24) and "cognitive psychologists study representational codes rather than media" (p. 7).&lt;/ref&gt;
Other significant cognitive scientists who also advocated a three level system were [[Allen Newell]], [[Zenon Pylyshyn]], and [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|David Marr]]. The parallels between the four representations (each of which implicitly assumed that computers ''and'' human minds displayed each of the three distinct levels) are detailed in the following table:

|-
| &lt;br/&gt;Physical Stance.&lt;ref&gt;In the case of both Dennett and Pylyshyn's terminology the designation "physical" means "relating to physics" (as in "physical laws"), with the strong implication that we are speaking of "[[Hard and soft science|hard science]]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  || Physical Level, or Biological Level.&lt;ref&gt;"The structure and the principles by which the physical object functions correspond to the physical or the biological level" (Pylyshyn, 1989, p. 57). "We obviously need the biological level to explain such things as the effects of drugs or jet lag or brain damage on behavior" (p.6 1).&lt;/ref&gt; || Physical Level, or Device Level.&lt;ref&gt;Essentially the same as Pylyshyn's ''Physical Level or Biological Level''.&lt;/ref&gt; || Hardware Implementation Level.&lt;ref&gt;Specifies the algorithm's physical substrates (Marr, 1982, p. 24): "How can the representation and algorithm be realized physically?" (p. 25).&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| &lt;br/&gt;Design Stance.&lt;ref&gt;In "Brain Writing and Mind Reading" (1975), Dennett very clearly states that he is agnostic about what he terms "Brain Writing".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; || Symbol Level.&lt;ref&gt;"The semantic content of knowledge and goals is assumed to be encoded by symbolic expressions" (Pylyshyn, 1989, p. 57). "We need the symbol level to explain such things as why some tasks take longer or result in more errors than other tasks" (p. 60). "Information processing psychology is full of examples of discovering that the form of the representation makes a difference to their [sic] behavior in experiments. For example, in problem-solving experiments it makes a difference whether subjects encode the fact that all the objects in a box are red or the equivalent fact that none of the objects is blue" (p. 61).&lt;/ref&gt; || Program Level, or Symbol Level.&lt;ref&gt;Essentially the same as Pylyshyn's ''Symbol Level''.&lt;/ref&gt; || Representation and Algorithm Level.&lt;ref&gt;Specifies how the device does what it does (Marr, 1982, p. 23): "How can this computational theory be implemented? In particular, what is the representation for the input and output, and what is the algorithm for the transformation?" (p. 25).&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| &lt;br/&gt;Intentional Stance.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett stressed "that the intentional stance presupposes '''''neither''''' lower stance" (Dennett 1971/1978, p. 240)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; || Semantic,&lt;ref&gt;: "Although the cognitive science community tends to use the term knowledge quite freely in discussing semantic level principles, it is sometimes worth distinguishing those semantic entities that are knowledge from those that are goals, percepts, plans, and so on. The more general term semantic level is used in contexts where such distinctions are important. Philosophers even talk about the 'intentional' level or 'intentional' objects, but because the use of that terminology tends to raise a large, ancient, and not entirely relevant set of issues, we [viz., Pylyshyn and Newell] shun that term here" (Pylyshyn, 1989, p. 86).&lt;/ref&gt; or Knowledge Level.&lt;ref&gt;Pylyshyn (1989): "[Explains] why people, or appropriately programmed computers, do certain things by saying what they know and what their goals are and by showing that these are connected in certain meaningful or even rational ways." (p. 57) "We need the knowledge level to explain why certain goals and beliefs tend to lead to certain behaviors, and why the behaviors can be changed in rational ways when new beliefs are added by telling things." (p. 60)&lt;/ref&gt; || Knowledge Level.&lt;ref&gt;Newell was aware of Dennett's views prior to Newell's (1980) address that was, later, published in full 1982: "Before I finished preparing that address I found and read ''Brainstorms''. It was instantly clear to  me that the knowledge level and the intentional stance are fundamentally the same, and I indicated as much in the talk." (Newell, 1988, p. 521)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newell (1982), p. 98: "The system at the knowledge level is the agent. The components at the knowledge level are '''''goals''''', '''''actions''''', and '''''bodies'''''. Thus, an agent is composed of a set of actions, a set of goals and a body. The medium at the knowledge level is '''''knowledge''''' (as might be suspected). Thus, the agent processes its knowledge to determine the actions to take. Finally, the behavior law is the '''''principle of rationality''''': Actions are selected to attain the agent's goals.&lt;br /&gt;"To treat a system at the knowledge level is to treat it as having some knowledge and some goals, and believing it will do whatever is within its power to attain its goals, in so far as its knowledge indicates."&lt;/ref&gt; || Computational Theory Level.&lt;ref&gt;This level specifies "'''''what''''' the device does and why" (Marr, 1982, p. 22): "What is the goal of the computation, why is it appropriate, and what is the logic of the strategy by which it can be carried out?" (p. 25)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections and replies==
The most obvious objection to Dennett is the intuition that it "matters" to us whether an object has an inner life or not. The claim is that we don't just imagine the intentional states of other people in order to predict their behaviour; the fact that they have thoughts and feelings just like we do is central to notions such as trust, friendship and love. The [[Blockhead argument]] proposes that someone, Jones, has a twin who is in fact not a person but a very sophisticated robot which looks and acts like Jones in every way, but who (it is claimed) somehow does not have any thoughts or feelings at all, just a chip which controls his behaviour; in other words, "the lights are on but no one's home". According to the intentional systems theory (IST), Jones and the robot have precisely the same beliefs and desires, but this is claimed to be false. The IST expert assigns the same mental states to Blockhead as he does to Jones, "whereas in fact [Blockhead] has not a thought in his head."  Dennett has argued against this by denying the premise, on the basis that the robot is a [[philosophical zombie]] and therefore metaphysically impossible.  In other words, if something acts in all ways conscious, it necessarily is, as consciousness is defined in terms of behavioral capacity, not ineffable [[qualia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/unzombie.htm Daniel Dennett, The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objection attacks the premise that treating people as [[perfect rationality|ideally rational]] creatures will yield the best predictions. [[Stephen Stich]] argues that people often have beliefs or desires which are irrational or bizarre, and IST doesn't allow us to say anything about these. If the person's "environmental niche" is examined closely enough, and the possibility of malfunction in their brain (which might affect their reasoning capacities) is looked into, it may be possible to formulate a predictive strategy specific to that person. Indeed this is what we often do when someone is behaving unpredictably &amp;mdash; we look for the reasons why. In other words, we can only deal with irrationality by contrasting it against the background assumption of rationality. This development significantly undermines the claims of the intentional stance argument.

The rationale behind the intentional stance is based on evolutionary theory, particularly the notion that the ability to make quick predictions of a system's behaviour based on what we think it might be thinking was an evolutionary adaptive advantage. The fact that our predictive powers are not perfect is a further result of the advantages sometimes accrued by acting contrary to expectations.

==Neural evidence==

Philip Robbins and Anthony I. Jack suggest that "Dennett's philosophical distinction between the physical and intentional stances has a lot going for it" from the perspective of psychology and neuroscience. They review studies on abilities to adopt an intentional stance (variously called "mindreading," "mentalizing," or "theory of mind") as distinct from adopting a physical stance ("folk physics," "intuitive physics," or "theory of body"). [[Autism]] seems to be a deficit in the intentional stance with preservation of the physical stance, while [[Williams syndrome]] can involve deficits in the physical stance with preservation of the intentional stance. This tentatively suggests a [[double dissociation]] of intentional and physical stances in the brain.&lt;ref name=RobbinsJack2006&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Philip Robbins|author2=Anthony I. Jack|title=The phenomenal stance|journal=Philosophical Studies|date=Jan 2006|volume=127|issue=1|pages=59–85|doi=10.1007/s11098-005-1730-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton AF | title = Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 881–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19508497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.621.6275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins and Jack point to a 2003 study&lt;ref name=MartinWeisberg2003&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Alex Martin|author2=Jill Weisberg|title=Neural Foundations For Understanding Social And Mechanical Concepts|journal=Cogn Neuropsychol|date=2003|volume=20|issue=3-6|pages=575–87|doi=10.1080/02643290342000005|pmc=1450338|pmid=16648880}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which participants viewed animated geometric shapes in different "vignettes," some of which could be interpreted as constituting social interaction, while others suggested mechanical behavior. Viewing social interactions elicited activity in brain regions associated with identifying faces and biological objects (posterior temporal cortex), as well as emotion processing (right amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex). Meanwhile, the mechanical interactions activated regions related to identifying objects like tools that can be manipulated (posterior temporal lobe). The authors suggest "that these findings reveal putative 'core systems' for social and mechanical understanding that are divisible into constituent parts or elements with distinct processing and storage capabilities."&lt;ref name=MartinWeisberg2003 /&gt;

==Phenomenal stance==

Robbins and Jack argue for an additional stance beyond the three that Dennett outlined. They call it the ''phenomenal stance'': Attributing consciousness, emotions, and inner experience to a mind. The [[explanatory gap]] of the [[hard problem of consciousness]] illustrates this tendency of people to see phenomenal experience as different from physical processes. The authors suggest that psychopathy may represent a deficit in the phenomenal but not intentional stance, while people with autism appear to have intact moral sensibilities, just not mind-reading abilities. These examples suggest a double dissociation between the intentional and phenomenal stances.&lt;ref name=RobbinsJack2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anthony I. Jack|author2=Philip Robbins|title=The Phenomenal Stance|journal=Philosophical Studies|date=Sep 2006|volume=|issue=127|pages=59–85|doi=10.1007/s11098-005-1730-x|url=https://www.academia.edu/173969/The_phenomenal_stance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a follow-up paper, Robbins and Jack describe four experiments about how the intentional and phenomenal stances relate to feelings of moral concern. The first two experiments showed that talking about lobsters as strongly emotional led to a much greater sentiment that lobsters deserved welfare protections than did talking about lobsters as highly intelligent. The third and fourth studies found that perceiving an agent as vulnerable led to greater attributions of phenomenal experience. Also, people who scored higher on the empathetic-concern subscale of the [[Interpersonal Reactivity Index]] had generally higher absolute attributions of mental experience.&lt;ref name=JackRobbins2012&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anthony I. Jack|author2=Philip Robbins|title=The Phenomenal Stance Revisited|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|date=Sep 2012|volume=3|issue=3|pages=383–403|doi=10.1007/s13164-012-0104-5|url=http://www.tonyjack.org/files/2012%20Jack%20and%20Robbins%20The%20phenomenal%20stance%20revisited.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryce Huebner (2010) performed two [[experimental philosophy]] studies to test students' ascriptions of various mental states to humans compared with cyborgs and robots. Experiment 1 showed that while students attributed both beliefs and pains most strongly to humans, they were more willing to attribute beliefs than pains to robots and cyborgs.&lt;ref name=Huebner2010&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bryce Huebner|title=Commonsense concepts of phenomenal consciousness: Does anyone ''care'' about functional zombies?|journal=Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences|date=Mar 2010|volume=9|issue=1|pages=133–55|doi=10.1007/s11097-009-9126-6|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/lbh24/CCPC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|138}} "[T]hese data seem to confirm that commonsense psychology does draw a distinction between phenomenal and non-phenomenal states--and this distinction seems to be dependent on the structural properties of an entity in a way that ascriptions of non-phenomenal states are not."&lt;ref name=Huebner2010 /&gt;{{rp|138–39}} However, this conclusion is only tentative in view of the high variance among participants.&lt;ref name=Huebner2010 /&gt;{{rp|139}} Experiment 2 showed analogous results: Both beliefs and happiness were ascribed most strongly to biological humans, and ascriptions of happiness to robots or cyborgs were less common than ascriptions of beliefs.&lt;ref name=Huebner2010 /&gt;{{rp|142}}

Though the 1968 '''''Encyclopedia''''' was initially intended to "complement, not supplant" MacMillan's earlier, fifteen-volume '''''[[Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences]]''''', which had been published from 1930 to 1967 and was edited by American economists [[Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman]] and [[Alvin Saunders Johnson]], it effectively replaced the earlier '''''Encyclopaedia''''', in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1237578|title=The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences: A Review Article|first=James P.|last=Cavin|date=1 January 1969|publisher=|journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics|volume=51|issue=2|pages=268–278|via=|doi=10.2307/1237578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences, Inc.

==Features==
[[File:Lds1blockdiagram05.svg|thumb|480px|Block diagram of Evans and Sutherland Line Drawing System 1.]]
It was controlled by a variety of host computers.  Straight lines were smoothly rendered in real-time animation.  General principles of operation were similar to the systems used today: 4x4 [[Transformation matrix|transformation matrices]], 1x4 [[Vertex (computer graphics)|vertices]].  Possible uses included flight simulation (in the product brochure there are screenshots of landing on a carrier), scientific imaging and [[Geographic information system|GIS]] systems.

==History==
The first LDS-1 was shipped to the customer ([[BBN Technologies|BBN]]) in August 1969.
Only a few of these systems were ever built. One was used by the [[Los Angeles Times]] as their first typesetting/layout computer. One went to [[NASA]] Ames Research Center for Human Factors Research. Another was bought by the [[Port Authority of New York]] to develop a tugboat pilot trainer for navigation in the harbor.

'''Marathon Reading''' is a yearly program put on by the [[UCLA]] department of [[English studies|English]], where a group of students, faculty, community members, [[alumni]], and often even [[celebrity|celebrities]] read a novel (or two) out loud non-stop for a 24-hour period.

Texas Tech University also hosts an annual marathon reading, coordinated by Dr. Rich Rice, Assistant Professor of English. Other higher-learning institutions that put on annual marathon readings include James Madison College at Michigan State University, Cleveland State University, Grand Valley State University, and Ball State University, Dr. Rice's doctoral alma mater.

The [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] in Massachusetts hosts an annual nonstop reading aloud of [[Moby-Dick]], the novel by [[Herman Melville]]. Held each January since 1995, the event marks the anniversary of Melville’s 1841 departure from the Port of New Bedford and Fairhaven aboard the whale ship Acushnet. Hundreds attend the approximately 25-hour multimedia event, which is [[live-streamed]] on the Internet.

The '''Planetary Science Decadal Survey''' is a publication of the [[United States National Research Council]] produced for [[NASA]] and other United States Government Agencies such as the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name= "NAP"&gt;National Academy of Sciences, National Academies Press, http://www.nap.edu/download.php?record_id=13117 , ''Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013–2022'', 2011; {{ISBN|978-0-309-22464-2}}. Retrieved February 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The document identifies key questions facing planetary science and outlines recommendations for space and ground-based exploration ten years into the future. Missions to gather data to answer these big questions are described and prioritized, where appropriate.&lt;ref name="statementofwork"&gt;{{cite journal|title=STATEMENT OF TASK|journal=Planetary Science Decadal Survey: 2013-2022|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/ssbsite/documents/webpage/ssb_052804.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=releaseanc&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Decadal Survey|url=http://www.planetary.org/get-involved/be-a-space-advocate/become-an-expert/what-is-the-decadal-survey.html/|publisher=Planetary Society|accessdate=22 Feb 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320224924/http://www.planetary.org/get-involved/be-a-space-advocate/become-an-expert/what-is-the-decadal-survey.html|archivedate=2015-03-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Decadal Survey and NASA Planetary Science (Prepublication version)|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/2013decadal/|publisher=NASA |accessdate= 22 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major purpose of the program is to maintain an overall balance to space exploration, where, at a given year the focus may shift to one target of interest, over time-scales of 10 to 15 years the general direction and scope of the programs goes in the desired way.&lt;ref name = "strategy 1986–1996"/&gt;

==2013–2022, Visions and Voyages for Planetary Science==
''Visions and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013 – 2022 (2011)'' was published in prepublication form on March 7, 2011,&lt;ref name="nasa2013" /&gt; and in final form later that year.&lt;ref name= "NAP" /&gt; Draft versions of the document were presented at town hall meetings around the country, at lunar and planetary conferences, and made available publicly on the NASA website and via the National Academies Press.&lt;ref name=nasa2013 /&gt; The report differed from previous reports in that it included "brutally honest" budgetary review from a 3rd party contractor.

The report highlighted a new Mars rover, a mission to Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and a mission to [[Uranus]] and its moons as proposed [[Flagship Program|Flagship Missions]].&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; The Mars mission was given highest priority, followed by the Europa mission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livestream.com/2011lpsc/video?clipId=pla_18e48f98-4a78-4acc-ad2a-29c7a8ae326c&lt;/ref&gt; The Mars rover proposal was called [[Mars Astrobiology Explorer Cacher|MAX-C]] and it would store samples for eventual return to Earth, but the method of return was left open.&lt;ref name=zab&gt;{{cite news|title=Lean U.S. missions to Mars, Jupiter moon recommended|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/08/us-space-usa-future-idUSTRE7266XJ20110308|work=7 March 2011|publisher=Reuters|date=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It only recommended the rover mission if it could be done cheaply enough (2.5 billion USD).&lt;ref name=zab/&gt;

The committee producing the survey was led by [[Steve Squyres]] of Cornell University and included 5 panels focusing on the [[Terrestrial planet|inner planets]] ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], and the [[Moon]]), [[Mars]] (not including [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]), the [[gas giant]] planets, satellites ([[Galilean satellites]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and other satellites of the giant planets) and [[Asteroid|primitive bodies]]  (Asteroids, comets, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]], [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], [[Pluto]]/[[Charon (moon)|Charon]] and other [[Kuiper belt object]]s, [[meteorite]]s, and [[interplanetary dust]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Planetary Exploration 2013–2022: Scientists are ready, what about you?|first1=Kunio M.|last1=Sayanagi|work=[[ArsTechnica]]|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/03/planetary-exploration-2013-2022-scientists-are-ready-what-about-you.ars|date=March 14, 2011|accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier NASA Planetary Science Surveys and studies of direction==

===2003–2013, New Frontiers in the Solar System===
[[File:Europa Rising.jpg|thumb|230px|Jupiter and Europa as viewed by New Horizons in 2007]]
The previous study, ''New Frontiers in the Solar System: An Integrated  Exploration Strategy 2003–2013'' was published by the National Academies Press, in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10432 New Frontiers in the Solar System: An Integrated  Exploration Strategy 2003–2013, National Academies Press]&lt;/ref&gt; The committee producing the survey was led by [[Michael J. Belton]].  The 5 panels focused on the [[Terrestrial planet|inner planets]], [[Mars]], the Giant planets, Large satellites and [[Astrobiology]].  The survey placed heavy emphasis on Mars exploration including the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s, established of the [[New Frontiers program]] including [[New Horizons]] mission to study Pluto and established programs in power and propulsion to lay a technological basis for programs in later decades including manned missions beyond Earth orbit.

===1995 to 2015, Space Science in the Twenty-First Century, Imperatives for the Decades===
While not titled as a decadal survey, a planetary science plan covering 1995–2015 was published by the Space Studies Board.  The report recommended a focus on "[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]-like missions to study Saturn, Uranus and Neptune" including a mission to rendezvous with Saturn's rings and study of Titan.  It also recommended study of the moon with a "[[Lunar Geoscience Orbiter]]", a network of lunar rovers and sample return from the lunar surface.  The report recommended a [[Mercury Orbiter]] to study not only that planet but provide some solar study as well.  A "Program of Extensive Study of Mars" beginning with [[Mars Pathfinder]] mission was planned for 1995 to be followed up by one in 1998 to return samples to Earth for study.  Study of primitive bodies such a comet or asteroid was recommended as a flyby mission of [[List of Apollo asteroids|Apollo]] and [[Amor asteroid]].&lt;ref name="1988 Decadal"&gt;{{cite book|title=Space Science in the Twenty-First Century – Imperatives for the Decades 1995 to 2015|year=1988|publisher=Space Studies Board|isbn=978-0-309-03885-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1965, Wood's Hole Study===
[[File:NASA Apollo 17 Lunar Roving Vehicle.jpg|thumb|Apollo 17's lunar roving vehicle, 1972]]
In the summer of 1965 the Space Science Board reviewed lunar and planetary science opportunities.&lt;ref name=ssb1968/&gt; Space exploration, astronomy, and the humans in space were major topics.&lt;ref name=compton&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4214/ch3-6.html#source42  Chapter 3 of NASA SP-4214]&lt;/ref&gt; These meetings brought together major ideas like the Grand tour, study of the outer planets and sun, and large space telescopes and there additional Woods hole meetings in 1969 and 1970 that influenced some of the large projects of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butrica|first1=Andrew J.|title=Voyager: The Grand Tour of Big Science|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter11.html|website=history.nasa.gov|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also showed signs of how the scientific community began to siphon the public's excitement about the manned exploration of space into more eccentric scientific projects, marking a shift from a more supportive role to actually taking the place of manned exploration.&lt;ref name="woods hole"&gt;{{cite web|title=Where No Man Has Gone Before, Ch3-6|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch3-6.html|website=www.hq.nasa.gov|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study marked a distinction between manned and unmanned missions, laying the foundation for a collision between two concepts in which scientists would explore the solar system from Earth using unmanned vehicles because that, rather than human exploration as an end in and of itself supported by science.&lt;ref name="woods hole"/&gt; Without boots on the ground public interest collapsed leaving astronauts purpose to be doing even more science experiments.&lt;ref name="woods hole"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6211">[[Polarization (waves)|Polarization]] is an important phenomenon in [[astronomy]]. 

==Stars==
The polarization of [[star#Radiation|starlight]] was first observed by the [[astronomer]]s [[William Hiltner]] and John S. Hall in 1949. Subsequently, [[Jesse Greenstein]] and [[Leverett Davis, Jr.]] developed theories allowing the use of polarization data to trace interstellar magnetic fields. 
Though the integrated [[thermal radiation]] of [[star]]s is not usually appreciably polarized at source, scattering by [[interstellar dust]] can impose polarization on starlight over long distances.  Net polarization at the source can occur if the [[photosphere]] itself is asymmetric, due to [[limb polarization]].  Plane polarization of starlight generated at the star itself is observed for [[Ap star]]s (peculiar A type stars).[https://web.archive.org/web/20040920073655/http://www.edpsciences.org/articles/eas/abs/2003/04/eas0928/eas0928.html]

==Sun==
Both [[circular polarization|circular]] and [[linear polarization]] of light from the Sun has been measured. Circular polarization is mainly due to transmission and absorption effects in strongly magnetic regions of the Sun's surface. Another mechanism that gives rise to circular polarization is the so-called "alignment-to-orientation mechanism". Continuum light is linearly polarized at different locations across the face of the Sun (limb polarization) though taken as a whole, this polarization cancels. Linear polarization in spectral lines is usually created by [[anisotropic scattering]] of photons on atoms and ions which can themselves be polarized by this interaction. The linearly polarized spectrum of the Sun is often called the [[second solar spectrum]]. [[Atomic polarization]] can be modified in weak magnetic fields by the [[Hanle effect]]. As a result, polarization of the scattered photons is also modified providing a diagnostics tool for understanding [[stellar magnetic field]]s.&lt;ref name=Landi&gt;{{cite book |author=Egidio Landi Degl'Innocenti|title=Polarization in Spectral Lines|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht|date=2004|isbn=1-4020-2414-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polarization is also present in radiation from [[coherent radiation|coherent]] astronomical sources due to the [[Zeeman effect]] (e.g. hydroxyl or methanol [[Astrophysical maser|masers]]).

The large radio lobes in [[Active galaxy|active galaxies]], and [[pulsar]] radio radiation (which may, it is speculated, sometimes be coherent) also show polarization. 

Apart from providing information on sources of radiation and scattering, polarization also probes the interstellar [[magnetic field]] in our Galaxy as well as in radio galaxies via [[Faraday rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Cosmic microwave background==
The polarization of the [[cosmic microwave background#polarization|cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) is also being used to study the physics of the very [[early universe]].&lt;ref name="boyle"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=96|date=2006|pages=111301|first=Latham A.|last=Boyle|title=Inflationary predictions for scalar and tensor fluctuations reconsidered|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.111301|pmid=16605810|last2=Steinhardt|first2=PJ|last3=Turok|first3=N|issue=11|arxiv = astro-ph/0507455 |bibcode = 2006PhRvL..96k1301B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tegmark"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Max|last=Tegmark|title=What does inflation really predict? | doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2005/04/001|journal=JCAP|volume=0504|issue=4|pages=001|date=2005|arxiv=astro-ph/0410281|bibcode = 2005JCAP...04..001T }}&lt;/ref&gt; CMB exhibits 2 components of polarization: [[B-modes|B-mode]] (divergence-free like magnetic field) and [[B-modes|E-mode]] (curl-free gradient-only like electric field) polarization. The [[BICEP2]] telescope located at the South Pole helped in the detection of B-mode polarization in the CMB. The polarization modes of the CMB may provide more information about the influence of [[Gravitational Waves]] on the development of the early universe.

Many of the world's countries, including many in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[South Asia]] and [[South East Asia]], have seen a sharp rise in population since the end of the [[Cold War]]. The fear is that high population numbers are putting further strain on natural resources, food supplies, fuel supplies, employment, housing, etc. in some of the less fortunate countries. For example, the population of [[Chad]] has ultimately grown from 6,279,921 in 1993 to 10,329,208 in 2009,&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; further straining its resources.

==History==

Population began growing rapidly in the [[Western world]] early in the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] of the late 18th century. The reasons for the "Modern Rise of Population"&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Modern Rise of Population|last=McKeown|first=Thomas|publisher=Edward Arnold|year=1976|isbn=9780713159868|location=London, UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were particularly investigated by the British health scientist [[Thomas McKeown (physician)|Thomas McKeown]] (1912-1988). In his publications, McKeown challenged four theories about the population growth: 
# McKeown stated that the growth in Western population, particularly surging in the 19th century, was not so much caused by an increase in [[fertility]], but largely by a decline of [[Mortality rate|mortality]] particularly of childhood mortality followed by [[infant mortality]],&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKeown T, Brown RG|date=1955|title=Medical evidence related to English population changes in the eighteenth century|journal=Population Studies|volume=9|issue=2|pages=119–141|doi=10.1080/00324728.1955.10404688|jstor=2172162|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKeown T, Brown RG, Record RG|date=1972|title=An interpretation of the modern rise of population in Europe|journal=Population Studies |volume=26 |pages=345-382|doi=|jstor=2173815|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The decline of mortality could largely be attributed to rising standards of living, whereby McKeown put most emphasis on improved nutritional status,
# His most controversial idea, at least his most disputed idea, was that he questioned the effectiveness of public health measures, including sanitary reforms, vaccination and quarantine,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKeown T, Record RG|date=1962
 |title=Reasons for the Decline of Mortality in England and Wales during the Nineteenth Century
 |journal=Population Studies|volume=16|issue=2|pages=94–122
 |doi=10.2307/2173119|jstor=2173119|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The sometime fierce disputes that his publication provoked around the "McKeown thesis", have overshadowed his more important and largely unchallenged argument that [[curative medicine]] measures played little role in mortality decline, not only prior to the mid-20th century&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; but also until well into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKeown T, Record RG, Turner RD|date=1975
 |title=An Interpretation of the Decline of Mortality in England and Wales during the Twentieth Century
 |journal=Population Studies|volume=29|issue=3|pages=391–422
 |doi=10.1080/00324728.1975.10412707|jstor=2173935|pmid=11630508}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the McKeown thesis has been heavily disputed, recent studies have confirmed the value of his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Korotayev |first=A. V. |last2=Malkov |first2=A. S. |year=2016 |url=https://www.academia.edu/35548090 |title=Compact Mathematical Model of the World System Economic and Demographic Growth, 1 CE–1973 CE |journal=INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL MODELS AND METHODS IN APPLIED SCIENCES |volume=10 |pages=200-209}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work is pivotal for present day thinking about population growth, birth control, public health and medical care. McKeown had a major influence on many population researchers, such as health economists and Nobel prize winners [[Robert Fogel|Robert W. Fogel]] (1993) and [[Angus Deaton]] (2015). The latter considered McKeown as 'the founder of [[social medicine]]'.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Great Escape. Health, wealth, and the origins of inequality|last=Deaton|first=Angus|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2013|isbn=978 0 691 15354 4|location=Princeton and Oxford|pages=91–93|quote=McKeown's views, updated to modern circumstances, are still important today in debates between those who think that health is primarily determined by medical discoveries and medical treatment and those who look to the background social conditions of life.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population growth rate==
The "population growth rate" is the rate at which the number of individuals in a population increases in a given time period, expressed as a fraction of the initial population. Specifically, population growth rate refers to the change in population over a unit time period, often expressed as a percentage of the number of individuals in the population at the beginning of that period. This can be written as the formula, valid for a sufficiently small time interval:

:&lt;math&gt;Population\ growth\ rate = \frac{ P(t_2)  -  P(t_1)} {P(t_1)(t_2-t_1)}&lt;/math&gt;

A positive growth rate indicates that the population is increasing, while a negative growth rate indicates that the population is decreasing. A growth ratio of zero indicates that there were the same number of individuals at the beginning and end of the period—a growth rate may be zero even when there are significant changes in the [[birth rate]]s, [[death rate]]s, [[immigration rate]]s, and age distribution between the two times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apheo.ca/index.php?pid=61 Association of Public Health Epidemiologists in Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522092307/http://www.apheo.ca/index.php?pid=61 |date=2008-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related measure is the [[net reproduction rate]]. In the absence of migration, a net reproduction rate of more than 1 indicates that the population of females is increasing, while a net reproduction rate less than one ([[sub-replacement fertility]]) indicates that the population of females is decreasing.

Most populations do not grow exponentially, rather they follow a [[Logistic function|logistic model]]. Once the population has reached its [[carrying capacity]], it will stabilize and the exponential curve will level off towards the carrying capacity, which is usually when a population has depleted most its [[natural resource]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Campbell Biology|last=Reece|first=Jane|last2=Urry|first2=Lisa|last3=Cain|first3=Michael|last4=Wasserman|first4=Steven|last5=Minorsky|first5=Peter|last6=Jackson|first6=Robert|publisher=Pearson|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Logistic growth graph (population ecology).JPG|thumb|The logistic growth of a population.]]

===Logistic equation===

The growth of a population can often be modelled by the [[Population_dynamics#Logistic_population_growth|logistic equation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brief Applied Calculus|last=Stewart|first=James|last2=Clegg|first2=Daniel|publisher=Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=kP\left(1-\frac{P}{K}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;P(t)&lt;/math&gt; = the population after time t;
* &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; = time a population grows;
* &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; = the relative growth rate coefficient;
* &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = the carrying capacity of the population; defined by ecologists as the maximum population size that a particular environment can sustain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As it is a separable differential equation, the population may be solved explicitly, producing a [[logistic function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=\frac{K}{1+Ae^{-rt}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;A=\frac{K-P_0}{P_0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial population at time 0.

In some countries the [[population decline|population is declining]], especially in [[Eastern Europe]], mainly due to low [[Total fertility rate|fertility rate]]s, high death rates and [[emigration]].

Many of the world's countries, including many in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[South Asia]] and [[South East Asia]], have seen a sharp rise in population since the end of the [[Cold War]]. The fear is that high population numbers are putting further strain on natural resources, food supplies, fuel supplies, employment, housing, etc. in some of the less fortunate countries. For example, the population of [[Chad]] has ultimately grown from 6,279,921 in 1993 to 10,329,208 in 2009,&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; further straining its resources. [[Vietnam]], [[Mexico]], [[Nigeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]] are witnessing a similar growth in population.

The following table gives some example countries:

==Growth by region==
Population growth rates vary by world region, with the highest growth rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and the lowest in Europe. For example, from 1950 to 2010, Sub-Saharan African grew over three and a half times, from about 186 million to 856 million. On the other hand, Europe only increased by 35%, from 547 million in 1950 to 738 million in 2010. As a result of these varying population growths, Sub-Saharan Africa changed from 7.4% of world population in 1950 to 12.4% in 2010, while Europe declined from 22% to 11% in the same time period.

According to the UN's 2017 revision to its population projections, world population is projected to reach 11.2 billion by 2100 compared to 7.6 billion in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/wpp/Documentation/publications.htm|title=World Population Prospects - Population Division - United Nations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Indian economist Sanjeev Sanyal disputed the UN's figures and argued that birth rates will fall below replacement rates in the 2020s. According to his projections, population growth will be only sustained till the 2040s by rising longevity, but will peak below 9 bn by 2050.&lt;ref name="Sanjeev Sanyal"/&gt; Conversely, a 2014 paper by demographers from several universities and the United Nations Population Division projected that the world's population would reach about 10.9 billion in 2100 and continue growing thereafter.&lt;ref name = Science&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1257469| pmid = 25301627| title = World population stabilization unlikely this century| journal = Science| volume = 346| issue = 6206| pages = 234–7| date = September 14, 2014| url  = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/09/17/science.1257469| issn  =  1095-9203| last1 = Gerland | first1 = P.| last2 = Raftery | first2 = A.

We found there’s a 70 percent probability the world population will not stabilize this century. Population, which had sort of fallen off the world’s agenda, remains a very important issue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/news/2014/09/18/world-population-to-keep-growing-this-century-hit-11-billion-by-2100/ World population to keep growing this century, hit 11 billion by 2100].

'''Public humanities''' is the work of engaging diverse publics in reflecting on heritage, traditions, and history, and the relevance of the [[humanities]] to the current conditions of civic and cultural life. Public humanities is often practiced within federal, state, [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] and community-based cultural organizations that engage people in conversations, facilitate and present lectures, exhibitions, performances and other programs for the general public on topics such as history, philosophy, popular culture and the arts. 

Workers within the public humanities endeavor to create physical and virtual spaces where the public can engage in conversation, learning and reflection about issues and ideas.  Public humanities projects include exhibitions and programming related to historic preservation, oral history, archives, material culture, public art, cultural heritage, and cultural policy. The [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] notes that public humanities projects it has supported in the past include "interpretation at historic sites, television and radio productions, museum exhibitions, podcasts, short videos, digital games, websites, mobile apps, and other digital media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/divisions/public|title=Division of Public Programs|website=National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many practitioners of public humanities are invested in ensuring the [[accessibility]] and relevance of the humanities to the general public or [[community group]]s.

The American Council of Learned Societies' National Task Force on Scholarship and the Public Humanities suggests that the nature of public humanities work is to teach the public the findings of academic scholarship: it sees "scholarship and the public humanities not as two distinct spheres but as parts of a single process, the process of taking private insight, testing it, and turning it into public knowledge."&lt;ref name="Quay1989" /&gt; Others suggest a more balanced understanding of the ways in which history, heritage and culture are shared between the academy and the public, drawing on the notion of [[shared historical authority]].

Subfields of the public humanities include [[public history]], [[public sociology]], [[public folklore]], [[public anthropology]], [[public philosophy]], [[historic preservation]], [[museum studies]], [[museum education]], [[cultural heritage management]], [[community archaeology]], [[public art]], and [[public science]].

== Programs in Public Humanities ==
Several universities have established programs in the public humanities (or have otherwise expressed commitments to public humanities via the creation of centers, degrees, or certificate programs with investments in various forms of "public" work), including:

*[http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx Bishop Grosseteste University], Lincoln, UK, whose newly created [http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/study/courses/Pages/sociology.aspx BA Sociology degree] has deliberately been placed within a School of Humanities, and will be delivered by members of a research cluster wherein the idea of "public sociology" (i.e. a sociology that engages audiences beyond the academy in cultural, literary and sociology debate) is activeliy cultivated and fostered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27564">'''Radiobiology''' (also known as '''radiation biology''') is a field of clinical and basic [[medical sciences]] that involves the study of the action of [[ionizing radiation]] on living things, especially '''health effects of radiation'''. Ionizing radiation is generally harmful and potentially lethal to living things but can have health benefits in [[radiation therapy]] for the treatment of cancer and [[thyrotoxicosis]]. Its most common impact is the [[radiation-induced cancer|induction of cancer]] with a [[Incubation period|latent period]] of years or decades after exposure. High doses can cause visually dramatic [[radiation burns]], and/or rapid fatality through [[acute radiation syndrome]]. Controlled doses are used for [[medical imaging]] and [[radiotherapy]].

==Health effects==
In general, ionizing radiation is harmful and potentially lethal to living beings but can have health benefits in [[radiation therapy]] for the treatment of cancer and [[thyrotoxicosis]].

Most adverse health effects of radiation exposure may be grouped in two general categories:
*deterministic effects (harmful tissue reactions) due in large part to the killing/ malfunction of cells following high doses; and
*stochastic effects, i.e., cancer and heritable effects involving either cancer development in exposed individuals owing to mutation of somatic cells or heritable disease in their offspring owing to mutation of reproductive (germ) cells.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 | loc= paragraph 55}}

===Stochastic===
Some effects of ionizing radiation on human health are [[stochastic]], meaning that their probability of occurrence increases with dose, while the severity is independent of dose.&lt;ref name="Christensen2014"/&gt; [[Radiation-induced cancer]], [[teratogenesis]], [[Radiation induced cognitive decline|cognitive decline]], and [[heart disease]] are all examples of stochastic effects.

Its most common impact is the stochastic [[radiation-induced cancer|induction of cancer]] with a latent period of years or decades after exposure. The mechanism by which this occurs is well understood, but quantitative models predicting the level of risk remain controversial. The most widely accepted model posits that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation increases linearly with [[effective radiation dose]] at a rate of 5.5% per [[sievert]].{{sfn | ICRP | 2007}} If this [[Linear no-threshold model|linear model]] is correct, then natural background radiation is the most hazardous source of radiation to general public health, followed by medical imaging as a close second. Other stochastic effects of ionizing radiation are [[teratogenesis]], [[Radiation-induced cognitive decline|cognitive decline]], and [[heart disease]].

Quantitative data on the effects of ionizing radiation on human health is relatively limited compared to other medical conditions because of the low number of cases to date, and because of the stochastic nature of some of the effects. Stochastic effects can only be measured through large epidemiological studies where enough data has been collected to remove confounding factors such as smoking habits and other lifestyle factors. The richest source of high-quality data comes from the study of Japanese [[atomic bomb survivors]]. In vitro and animal experiments are informative, but [[radioresistance]] varies greatly across species.

The added lifetime risk of developing cancer by a single abdominal CT of 8 [[sievert|mSv]] is estimated to be 0.05%, or 1 one in 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-ct-scans-cause-cancer|title=Do CT scans cause cancer?|date=March 2013|website=[[Harvard Medical School]]|accessdate=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deterministic===
{{Further|Acute radiation syndrome}}
[[Deterministic]] effects are those that reliably occur above a threshold dose, and their severity increases with dose.&lt;ref name="Christensen2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Christensen DM, Iddins CJ, Sugarman SL |title=Ionizing radiation injuries and illnesses|date=February 2014|journal=Emerg Med Clin North Am|volume=32|issue=1|pages=245–65|pmid=24275177|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2013.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High radiation dose gives rise to deterministic effects which reliably occur above a threshold, and their severity increases with dose. Deterministic effects are not necessarily more or less serious than stochastic effects; either can ultimately lead to a temporary nuisance or a fatality. Examples of deterministic effects are:
*[[Acute radiation syndrome]], by acute whole-body radiation
*[[Radiation burn]]s, from radiation to a particular body surface
*[[Radiation-induced thyroiditis]], a potential side effect from radiation treatment against [[hyperthyroidism]]
*[[Chronic radiation syndrome]], from long-term radiation.
*[[Radiation-induced lung injury]], from for example [[radiation therapy]] to the lungs
*[[Cataract]]s, and infertility.&lt;ref name="Christensen2014"/&gt;

The US National Academy of Sciences Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation Committee "has concluded that there is no compelling evidence to indicate a dose threshold below which the risk of tumor induction is zero"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11340&amp;page=10|title=Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation: BEIR VII Phase 2|year=2006|publisher=National Academy of Science|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Whole-body absorbed dose symptom}}

===By type of radiation===
When alpha particle emitting isotopes are ingested, they are far more dangerous than their half-life or decay rate would suggest. This is due to the high [[relative biological effectiveness]] of alpha radiation to cause biological damage after alpha-emitting radioisotopes enter living cells. Ingested alpha emitter radioisotopes such as [[Transuranium element|transuranics]] or [[actinides]] are an average of about 20 times more dangerous, and in some experiments up to 1000 times more dangerous than an equivalent activity of beta emitting or gamma emitting radioisotopes. If the radiation type is not known then it can be determined by differential measurements in the presence of electrical fields, magnetic fields, or varying amounts of shielding.

[[File:Dose quantities and units.png|thumb|400px|External dose quantities used in radiation protection. See article on [[sievert]] on how these are calculated and used.]]

===In pregnancy===
The risk for developing radiation-induced cancer at some point in life is greater when exposing a fetus than an adult, both because the cells are more vulnerable when they are growing, and because there is much longer lifespan after the dose to develop cancer.

Possible deterministic effects include of radiation exposure in pregnancy include [[miscarriage]], structural [[birth defect]]s,  [[Intrauterine growth restriction|Growth restriction]] and [[intellectual disability]].&lt;ref name=acog&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Guidelines-for-Diagnostic-Imaging-During-Pregnancy-and-Lactation|title=Guidelines for Diagnostic Imaging During Pregnancy and Lactation|website=[[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]]}} February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The determinstistic effects have been studied at for example survivors of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and cases where [[radiation therapy]] has been necessary during pregnancy:

{|class="wikitable"
! [[Gestational age]] !! [[Embryonic age]] !! Effects !! Estimated threshold dose ([[Gray (unit)|mGy]])
|-
| 2 to 4 weeks || 0 to 2 weeks || [[Miscarriage]] or none (all or nothing) || 50 - 100&lt;ref name=acog/&gt;
|-
|rowspan=2| 4 to 10 weeks ||rowspan=2| 2 to 8 weeks || Structural [[birth defect]]s || 200&lt;ref name=acog/&gt;
|-
| [[Intrauterine growth restriction|Growth restriction]] || 200 - 250&lt;ref name=acog/&gt;
|-
| 10 to 17 weeks || 8 to 15 weeks || Severe [[intellectual disability]] || 60 - 310&lt;ref name=acog/&gt;
|-
| 18 to 27 weeks || 16 to 25 weeks || Severe [[intellectual disability]] (lower risk) || 250 - 280&lt;ref name=acog/&gt;
|}

The intellectual deficit has been estimated to be about 25 [[Intelligence quotient|IQ-points]] per 1,000 mGy at 10 to 17 weeks of gestational age.&lt;ref name=acog/&gt;

These effects are sometimes relevant when deciding about [[medical imaging in pregnancy]], since [[projectional radiography]] and [[CT scan]]ning exposes the fetus to radiation.

Also, the risk for the mother of later acquiring [[radiation-induced cancer|radiation-induced]] [[breast cancer]] seems to be particularly high for radiation doses during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="RonckersErdmann2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ronckers|first1=Cécile M|last2=Erdmann|first2=Christine A|last3=Land|first3=Charles E|title=Radiation and breast cancer: a review of current evidence|journal=Breast Cancer Research|volume=7|issue=1|pages=21–32|year=2004|issn=1465-542X|doi=10.1186/bcr970|pmid=15642178|pmc=1064116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
The human body cannot sense ionizing radiation except in very high doses, but the effects of ionization can be used to characterize the radiation. Parameters of interest include disintegration rate, particle flux, particle type, beam energy, kerma, dose rate, and radiation dose.

The monitoring and calculation of doses to safeguard human health is called [[dosimetry]] and is undertaken within the science of [[health physics]]. Key measurement tools are the use of [[dosimeter]]s to give the external [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] uptake and the use of bio-assay for ingested dose. The article on the [[sievert]] summarises the recommendations of the ICRU and ICRP on the use of dose quantities and includes a guide to the effects of ionizing radiation as measured in sieverts, and gives examples of approximate figures of dose uptake in certain situations.

The [[committed dose]] is a measure of the stochastic health risk due to an intake of radioactive material into the human body. The ICRP states "For internal exposure, committed effective doses are generally determined from an assessment of the intakes of radionuclides from bioassay measurements or other quantities. The radiation dose is determined from the intake using recommended dose coefficients".{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 | loc= paragraph 144 }}

===Absorbed, equivalent and effective dose===
The [[Absorbed dose]] is a physical dose quantity ''D'' representing the mean energy imparted to [[matter]] per unit mass by [[ionizing radiation]]. In the SI system of units, the unit of measure is joules per kilogram, and its special name is [[Gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy).{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 | loc=glossary }} The non-SI [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS]] unit [[rad (unit)|rad]] is sometimes also used, predominantly in the USA.

To represent stochastic risk the [[equivalent dose]] ''H'' &lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and [[Effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] ''E'' are used, and appropriate dose factors and coefficients are used to calculate these from the absorbed dose.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 | loc= paragraphs 104 and 105 }} Equivalent and effective dose quantities are expressed in units of the [[sievert]] or [[rem (unit)|rem]] which implies that biological effects have been taken into account. These are usually in accordance with the recommendations of the [[ICRP|International Committee on Radiation Protection]] (ICRP) and [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU). The coherent system of radiological protection quantities developed by them is shown in the accompanying diagram.

==Organizations==
The [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) manages the International System of Radiological Protection, which sets recommended limits for dose uptake. Dose values may represent absorbed, equivalent, effective, or committed dose.

Other important organizations studying the topic include
*[[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU)
*[[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR)
*US [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (NCRP)
*UK [[Public Health England]] 
*US [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS through the BEIR studies)
*French [[Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire]] (IRSN)
*[[European Committee on Radiation Risk]] (ECRR) the stage of radiation depends on the stage the body parts are affected

== Exposure pathways ==

===External===
[[File:Externalsource.svg|thumb|A schematic diagram showing a rectangle being irradiated by an external source (in red) of radiation (shown in yellow).]]
[[File:Contaminationonskin.svg|thumb|A schematic diagram showing a rectangle being irradiated by radioactive contamination (shown in red) which is present on an external surface such as the skin; this emits radiation (shown in yellow) which can enter the animal's body]]
External exposure is exposure which occurs when the radioactive source (or other radiation source) is outside (and remains outside) the organism which is exposed. Examples of external exposure include:

* A person who places a sealed [[radioactive source]] in his pocket
* A space traveller who is irradiated by [[cosmic ray]]s
* A person who is treated for [[cancer]] by either [[teletherapy]] or [[brachytherapy]]. While in brachytherapy the source is inside the person it is still considered external exposure because it does not result in a [[committed dose]].
* A nuclear worker whose hands have been dirtied with radioactive dust. Assuming that his hands are cleaned before any radioactive material can be absorbed, inhaled or ingested, skin contamination is considered external exposure.

External exposure is relatively ''easy'' to estimate, and the irradiated organism does not become radioactive, except for a case where the radiation is an intense [[neutron]] beam which causes [[neutron activation|activation]].

====By type of medical imaging====
{{Effective dose by medical imaging type}}

===Internal===
Internal exposure occurs when the radioactive material enters the organism, and the radioactive atoms become incorporated into the organism. This can occur through inhalation, ingestion, or injection. Below are a series of examples of internal exposure.

* The exposure caused by [[potassium-40]] present within a ''normal'' person.
* The exposure to the ingestion of a soluble radioactive substance, such as [[strontium-89|&lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr]] in [[cow]]s' [[milk]].
* A person who is being treated for cancer by means of a [[radiopharmaceutical]] where a radioisotope is used as a drug (usually a liquid or pill). A review of this topic was published in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wynn |first=Volkert |last2=Hoffman |first2=Timothy |title=Therapeutic Radiopharmaceuticals afrtin=2+3=9000 |journal=Chemical Reviews |volume=99 |issue=9 |pages=2269–92 |year=1999 |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/chreay/1999/99/i09/pdf/cr9804386.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1021/cr9804386 |pmid=11749482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the radioactive material becomes intimately mixed with the affected object it is often difficult to decontaminate the object or person in a case where internal exposure is occurring. While some very insoluble materials such as [[fission product]]s within a [[uranium dioxide]] matrix might never be able to truly become part of an organism, it is normal to consider such particles in the lungs and digestive tract as a form of internal contamination which results in internal exposure.
*[[Boron neutron capture therapy]] (BNCT) involves injecting a [[boron-10]] tagged chemical that preferentially binds to tumor cells. Neutrons from a [[nuclear reactor]] are shaped by a [[neutron moderator]] to the neutron energy spectrum suitable for BNCT treatment. The tumor is selectively bombarded with these neutrons. The neutrons quickly slow down in the body to become low energy ''thermal neutrons''. These ''thermal neutrons'' are captured by the injected boron-10, forming excited (boron-11) which breaks down into [[lithium-7]] and a [[helium-4]] [[alpha particle]] both of these produce closely spaced ionizing radiation.This concept is described as a binary system using two separate components for the therapy of cancer. Each component in itself is relatively harmless to the cells, but when combined together for treatment they produce a highly cytocidal ([[cytotoxic]]) effect which is lethal (within a limited range of 5-9 micrometers or approximately one cell diameter). Clinical trials, with promising results, are currently carried out in Finland and Japan.

When radioactive compounds enter the human body, the effects are different from those resulting from exposure to an external radiation source. Especially in the case of alpha radiation, which normally does not penetrate the skin, the exposure can be much more damaging after ingestion or inhalation. The radiation exposure is normally expressed as a [[committed dose]].

==History==
Although radiation was discovered in late 19th century, the dangers of radioactivity and of radiation were not immediately recognized. Acute effects of radiation were first observed in the use of X-rays when [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] intentionally subjected his fingers to X-rays in 1895. He published his observations concerning the burns that developed, though he misattributed them to ozone, a [[free radical]] produced in air by X-rays. Other free radicals produced within the body are now understood to be more important. His injuries healed later.

As a field of medical sciences, radiobiology originated from [[Leopold Freund]]'s 1896 demonstration of the therapeutic treatment of a hairy [[Melanocytic nevus|mole]] using a new type of [[electromagnetic radiation]] called [[x-rays]], which was discovered 1 year previously by the German physicist, [[Wilhelm Röntgen]]. After irradiating frogs and insects with X-rays in early 1896, [[Ivan Romanovich Tarkhanov]] concluded that these newly discovered rays not only photograph, but also "affect the living function".&lt;ref&gt;Y. B. Kudriashov. ''Radiation Biophysics''. {{ISBN|9781600212802}}. Page xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Pierre and [[Marie Curie]] discovered the radioactive polonium and radium later used  to treat [[cancer]].

The genetic effects of radiation, including the effects on cancer risk, were recognized much later. In 1927 [[Hermann Joseph Muller]] published research showing genetic effects, and in 1946 was awarded the [[Nobel prize]] for his findings.

More generally, the 1930s saw attempts to develop a general model for radiobiology. Notable here was Douglas Lea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=E J |title=Radiation and the single cell: the physicist's contribution to radiobiology |journal=Physics in Medicine and Biology |date=1 May 1976 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=347–359 |doi=10.1088/0031-9155/21/3/001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiobiology in the 1940s |url=https://www.bir.org.uk/patients-public/history-of-radiology/1940s/1940s-radiobiology/ |website=British Institute of Radiology |accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose presentation also included an exhaustive review of some 400 supporting publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lea |first1=Douglas |title=Actions of Radiations on Living Cells |date=1955 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=9781001281377 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nTw4AAAAIAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=J.

Before the biological effects of radiation were known, many physicians and corporations had begun marketing radioactive substances as [[patent medicine]] and [[radioactive quackery]]. Examples were radium [[enema]] treatments, and radium-containing waters to be drunk as tonics. [[Marie Curie]] spoke out against this sort of treatment, warning that the effects of radiation on the human body were not well understood. Curie later died of [[aplastic anemia]] caused by radiation poisoning. [[Eben Byers]], a famous American socialite, died of multiple cancers (but not acute radiation syndrome) in 1932 after consuming large quantities of [[radium]] over several years; his death drew public attention to dangers of radiation. By the 1930s, after a number of cases of bone necrosis and death in enthusiasts, radium-containing medical products had nearly vanished from the market.

In the United States, the experience of the so-called [[Radium Girls]], where thousands of radium-dial painters contracted oral cancers&lt;ref name= "NYT_1998-10-06"&gt;{{cite news

[[Robley D. Evans (physicist)|Robley D. Evans]], at [[MIT]], developed the first standard for permissible body burden of [[radium]], a key step in the establishment of [[nuclear medicine]] as a field of study. With the development of [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s in the 1940s, heightened scientific attention was given to the study of all manner of radiation effects.

The [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] resulted in a large number of incidents of radiation poisoning, allowing for greater insight into its symptoms and dangers. Red Cross Hospital Surgeon, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki led intensive research into the Syndrome in the weeks and months following the Hiroshima bombings. Dr Sasaki and his team were able to monitor the effects of radiation in patients of varying proximities to the blast itself, leading to the establishment of three recorded stages of the syndrome. Within 25–30 days of the explosion, the Red Cross surgeon noticed a sharp drop in white blood cell count and established this drop, along with symptoms of fever, as prognostic standards for Acute Radiation Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carmichael|first=Ann G.|title=Medicine: A Treasury of Art and Literature|year=1991|publisher=Harkavy Publishing Service|location=New York|isbn=978-0-88363-991-7|pages=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Actress [[Midori Naka]], who was present during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, was the first incident of radiation poisoning to be extensively studied. Her death on August 24, 1945 was the first death ever to be officially certified as a result of radiation poisoning (or "Atomic bomb disease").

The activity of biological and astronomical systems inevitably generates magnetic and electrical fields, which can be measured with sensitive instruments and which have at times been suggested as a basis for "[[Energy (esotericism)|esoteric]]" ideas of energy.

==Radiation sources for experimental radiobiology==
Radiobiology experiments typically make use of a radiation source which could be:
* An [[radioactive isotope|isotopic source]], typically [[Caesium-137|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] or [[Cobalt-60|&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co]].
* A  [[particle accelerator]] generating high energy [[protons]], [[electrons]] or charged ions. Biological samples can be irradiated using either a broad, uniform beam&lt;ref&gt;Pattison, J.

==Introduction==

===Relative species abundance===
[[File:Hollow curve beetles.png|thumb|'''Figure 1'''. Relative species abundance of beetles sampled from the river Thames showing the universal "hollow curve". (derived from data presented in Magurran (2004)&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt; and collected by [[C.B. Williams]] (1964)&lt;ref name=Williams64&gt;Williams, C.B. 1964. ''Patterns in the balance of nature and related problems in quantitative ecology''. Academic Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;)]]
Relative species abundance and species richness describe key elements of [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; Relative species abundance refers to how common or rare a species is relative to other species in a given location or community.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;&lt;ref name=McGill&gt;McGill, B. J., Etienne R. S., Gray J. S., Alonso D., Anderson M. J., Benecha H. K., Dornelas M., Enquist B. J., Green J. L., He F., Hurlbert A. H., Magurran A. E., Marquet P. A., Maurer B. A., Ostling A., Soykan C. U., Ugland K. I., White E. P. 2007. "Species abundance distributions: moving beyond single prediction theories to integration within an ecological framework". ''Ecology Letters'' 10: 995–1015&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually relative species abundances are described for a single [[trophic level]]. Because such species occupy the same [[trophic level]] they will potentially or actually compete for similar resources.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; For example, relative species abundances might describe all terrestrial birds in a forest community or all [[planktonic]] [[copepods]] in a particular marine environment.

Relative species abundances follow very similar patterns over a wide range of ecological communities. When plotted as a histogram of the number of species represented by 1, 2, 3, ..., ''n'' individuals usually fit a hollow curve, such that most species are rare, (represented by a single individual in a community sample) and relatively few species are abundant (represented by a large number of individuals in a community sample)(Figure 1).&lt;ref name=McGill/&gt; This pattern has been long-recognized and can be broadly summarized with the statement that "most species are rare".&lt;ref&gt;Andrewartha, H. G.; Birch L. C. 1954. ''The Distribution and Abundance of Animals''. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Charles Darwin]] noted in 1859 in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' that "... rarity is the attribute of vast numbers of species in all classes...."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 2004 (1859). ''The Origin of Species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life''. Castle Books, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Species abundance patterns can be best visualized in the form of relative abundance distribution plots. The consistency of relative species abundance patterns suggests that some common macroecological "rule" or process determines the distribution of individuals among species within a trophic level.

===Distribution plots===
[[File:PrestonPlot beetles.png|thumb|'''Figure 2'''. ''Preston plot'' of beetles sampled from the river Thames showing a strong right-skew.&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams64/&gt;]]
[[File:Rank abundance beetles.png|thumb|'''Figure 3'''. ''Whittaker plot'' of beetles sampled from the river Thames showing a slight "s"-shape.&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams64/&gt;]]
Relative species abundance distributions are usually graphed as frequency histograms ("Preston plots"; Figure 2)&lt;ref name=Preston&gt;{{cite journal | author = Preston, F. W. | year = 1948 | title = The Commonness, and Rarity, of Species | journal = Ecology | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 254–283 | url = http://www.bgu.ac.il/desert_agriculture/Vegecology/Papers/Preston48.pdf | doi = 10.2307/1930989}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[rank abundance curve|rank-abundance diagrams]] ("Whittaker Plots"; Figure 3).&lt;ref name=Whittaker65&gt;Whittaker, R. H. 1965. "Dominance and diversity in land plant communities", ''Science'' 147: 250–260&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frequency histogram (Preston plot)''':

::'''''x''-axis''': logarithm of abundance bins (historically log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a rough approximation to the natural logarithm)

::'''''y''-axis''': number of species at given abundance

'''Rank-abundance diagram (Whittaker plot)''':

::'''''x''-axis''': species list, ranked in order of descending abundance (i.e. from common to rare)

::'''''y''-axis''': logarithm of % relative abundance

When plotted in these ways, relative species abundances from wildly different data sets show similar patterns: frequency histograms tend to be right-skewed (e.g. Figure 2) and rank-abundance diagrams tend to conform to the curves illustrated in Figure 4.

==Understanding relative species abundance patterns==
Researchers attempting to understand relative species abundance patterns usually approach them in a descriptive or mechanistic way. Using a descriptive approach biologists attempt to fit a mathematical model to real data sets and infer the underlying biological principles at work from the model parameters. By contrast, mechanistic approaches create a mathematical model based on biological principles and then test how well these models fit real data sets.&lt;ref name=Tokeshi99&gt;Tokeshi, M. 1999. ''Species coexistence: ecological and evolutionary perspectives''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive approaches===

====Geometric series (Motomura 1932)====
[[File:Common descriptiveWhittaker.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 4'''. Generic Rank-abundance diagram of three common mathematical models used to fit species abundance distributions: Motomura's geometric series, Fisher's logseries, and Preston's log-normal series (modified from Magurran 1988)&lt;ref name=Magurran88&gt;Magurran, A. E. 1988. ''Ecological Diversity and Its Measurement''. Princeton Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Succession.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 5'''. Plant succession in abandoned fields within Brookhaven National Laboratory, NY. Species abundances conform to the geometric series during early succession but approach lognormal as the community ages. (modified from Whittaker 1972&lt;ref name=Whittaker72&gt;Whittaker, R. H. 1972. "Evolution and measurement of species diversity". ''Taxon'' 21:213&amp;ndash;251&lt;/ref&gt;)]]
I. Motomura developed the geometric series model based on benthic community data in a lake.&lt;ref name=Motomura&gt;Motomura, I. 1932. "A statistical treatment of associations", ''Japanese Journal of Zoology''. 44: 379–383 (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; Within the geometric series each species' level of abundance is a sequential, constant proportion (''k'') of the total number of individuals in the community. Thus if ''k'' is 0.5, the most common species would represent half of individuals in the community (50%), the second most common species would represent half of the remaining half (25%), the third, half of the remaining quarter (12.5%) and so forth.

Although Motomura originally developed the model as a statistical (descriptive) means to plot observed abundances, the "discovery" of his paper by Western researchers in 1965 led to the model being used as a [[niche apportionment models|niche apportionment model]] &amp;ndash; the "niche-preemption model".&lt;ref name=Whittaker65/&gt; In a mechanistic model ''k'' represents the proportion of the resource base acquired by a given species.

The geometric series rank-abundance diagram is linear with a slope of –''k'', and reflects a rapid decrease in species abundances by rank (Figure 4).&lt;ref name=Motomura/&gt; The geometric series does not explicitly assume that species colonize an area sequentially, however, the model fits the concept of niche preemption, where species sequentially colonize a region and the first species to arrive receives the majority of resources.&lt;ref name=He_Tang&gt;He , F., Tang D. 2008. "Estimating the niche preemption parameter of the geometric series" ''Acta Oecologica'' 33 (1):105&amp;ndash;107&lt;/ref&gt; The geometric series model fits observed species abundances in highly uneven communities with low diversity.&lt;ref name=He_Tang/&gt; This is expected to occur in terrestrial plant communities (as these assemblages often show strong dominance) as well as communities at early successional stages and those in harsh or isolated environments (Figure 5).&lt;ref name=Whittaker65/&gt;

====Logseries (Fisher ''et al'' 1943)====

: &lt;math&gt;S=\alpha\ln{\left(1+{N\over{\alpha\,\!}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

''where'':

:''S'' = the number of species in the sampled community

:''N'' = the number of individuals sampled

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = a constant derived from the sample data set

The logseries was developed by [[Ronald Fisher]] to fit two different abundance data sets: British moth species (collected by [[Carrington Bonsor Williams|Carrington Williams]]) and Malaya butterflies (collected by [[Alexander Steven Corbet]]).&lt;ref name=Fisher_etal&gt;Fisher, R. A; Corbet, A. S.; Williams, C. B. 1943. "The relation between the number of species and the number of individuals in a random sample of an animal population". ''Journal of Animal Ecology'' 12: 42&amp;ndash;58.&lt;/ref&gt; The logic behind the derivation of the logseries is varied&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. L.; Adrienne, W. K.; Kotz, S. (2005). ''Univariate and Discrete Distributions'', 3rd edn. John Wiley and Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt; however Fisher proposed that sampled species abundances would follow a negative binomial from which the zero abundance class (species too rare to be sampled) was eliminated.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; He also assumed that the total number of species in a community was infinite. Together, this produced the [[logarithmic series distribution|logseries distribution]] (Figure 4). The logseries predicts the number of species at different levels of abundance (''n'' individuals) with the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;S_n= {\alpha\,\!x^n \over n}&lt;/math&gt;

''where:''

:S = the number of species with an abundance of ''n''

:''x''&amp;nbsp;= a positive constant (0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1) which is derived from the sample data set and generally approaches 1 in value

The number of species with 1, 2, 3, ..., ''n'' individuals are therefore:
 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha, {\alpha\,\!x^2\over{2}}, {\alpha\,\!x^3\over{3}}, \dots, {\alpha\,\!x^n\over{n}} &lt;/math&gt;

=====Fisher’s constants=====
[[File:R. A. Fischer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ronald Fisher]]
The constants ''α'' and ''x'' can be estimated through iteration from a given species data set using the values ''S'' and ''N''.&lt;ref name=Magurran04&gt;Magurran, A. E. 2004. ''Measuring biological diversity''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher's [[dimensionless]] ''α'' is often used as a measure of biodiversity, and indeed has recently been found to represent the fundamental biodiversity parameter ''θ'' from neutral theory ([[Relative species abundance#Fisher.E2.80.99s alpha and Hubbell.E2.80.99s theta .E2.80.93 an interesting convergence|see below]]).

====Log normal (Preston 1948)====
[[File:Prestonsveil copy.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 6'''. An example of Preston's veil. Fish species abundances sampled using repeated trawling over a one-month (blue bars), two month (gold bars) and one-year period (yellow). One year of sampling indicates that the fish community is log-normally distributed. (derived from Magurran 2004&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;)]]
Using several data sets (including breeding bird surveys from New York and Pennsylvania and moth collections from Maine, Alberta and Saskatchewan) [[Frank W. Preston]] (1948) argued that species abundances (when binned logarithmically in a Preston plot) follow a [[Gaussian function|Normal (Gaussian) distribution]], partly as a result of the [[Central Limit Theorem]] (Figure 4).&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt; This means that the abundance distribution is [[Lognormal]]. According to his argument, the right-skew observed in species abundance frequency histograms (including those described by Fisher ''et al.'' (1943)&lt;ref name=Fisher_etal/&gt;) was, in fact, a sampling artifact. Given that species toward the left side of the ''x''-axis are increasingly rare, they may be missed in a random species sample. As the sample size increases however, the likelihood of collecting rare species in a way that accurately represents their abundance also increases, and more of the normal distribution becomes visible.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt; The point at which rare species cease to be sampled has been termed ''Preston's veil line''. As the sample size increases Preston's veil is pushed farther to the left and more of the normal curve becomes visible&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Magurran88/&gt;(Figure 6).  Williams' moth data, originally used by Fisher to develop the logseries distribution, became increasingly lognormal as more years of sampling were completed.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams64/&gt;

=====Calculating theoretical species richness=====
Preston's theory has an application: if a community is truly lognormal yet under-sampled, the lognormal distribution can be used to estimate the true species richness of a community. Assuming the shape of the total distribution can be confidently predicted from the collected data, the normal curve can be fit via statistical software or by completing the [[Gaussian function|Gaussian formula]]:&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; n = n_0 e^{-(aR)^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;

''where:''

:''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of species in the modal bin (the peak of the curve)
 
:''n'' is the number of species in bins ''R'' distant from the modal bin

:''a'' is a constant derived from the data

It is then possible to predict how many species are in the community by calculating the total area under the curve&amp;nbsp;(''N''):

: &lt;math&gt;N= {n_0\sqrt{\pi}\over a}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of species missing from the data set (the missing area to the left of the veil line) is simply ''N'' minus the number of species sampled.&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt; Preston did this for two lepidopteran data sets, predicting that, even after 22 years of collection, only 72% and 88% of the species present had been sampled.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

====Yule model (Nee 2003) ====
The Yule model is based on a much earlier, [[Galton&amp;ndash;Watson process|Galton&amp;ndash;Watson model]] which was used to describe the distribution of species among [[genera]].&lt;ref&gt;Yule, G. U. 1924. "A mathematical theory of evolution based on the conclusions of Dr. J. C. Willis, FRS". ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B'' 213: 21–87&lt;/ref&gt; The Yule model assumes random branching of species trees, with each species (branch tip) having the equivalent probability of giving rise to new species or becoming extinct. As the number of species within a genus, within a clade, has a similar distribution to the number of individuals within a species, within a community (i.e. the "hollow curve"), Sean Nee (2003) used the model to describe relative species abundances.&lt;ref name=McGill/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nee&gt;Nee, S. 2003. "The unified phenomenological theory of biodiversity". In T. Blackburn and K. Gaston, editors, ''Macroecology: concepts and consequences''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways this model is similar to [[niche apportionment models]], however, Nee intentionally did not propose a biological mechanism for the model behavior, arguing that any distribution can be produced by a variety of mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Nee/&gt;

===Mechanistic approaches: niche apportionment===
''Note'': This section provides a general summary of niche apportionment theory, more information can be found under [[niche apportionment models]].

Most mechanistic approaches to species abundance distributions use niche-space, i.e. available resources, as the mechanism driving abundances. If species in the same [[trophic level]] consume the same resources (such as nutrients or sunlight in plant communities, prey in carnivore communities, nesting locations or food in bird communities) and these resources are limited, how the resource "pie" is divided among species determines how many individuals of each species can exist in the community. Species with access to lots of resources will have higher carrying capacities than those with little access. Mutsunori Tokeshi&lt;ref&gt;Tokeshi, M. 1990. "Niche apportionment or random assortment: species abundance patterns revisited". ''Journal of Animal Ecology'' 59: 1129&amp;ndash;1146&lt;/ref&gt; later elaborated niche apportionment theory to include niche filling in unexploited resource space.&lt;ref name=Tokeshi99/&gt; Thus, a species may survive in the community by carving out a portion of another species' niche (slicing up the pie into smaller pieces) or by moving into a vacant niche (essentially making the pie larger, for example, by being the first to arrive in a newly available location or through the development of a novel trait that allows access previously unavailable resources). Numerous [[niche apportionment models]] have been developed. Each make different assumptions about how species carve up niche-space.

====Unified neutral theory (Hubbell 1979/2001)====
{{main|Unified neutral theory of biodiversity}}

The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (UNTB) is a special form of mechanistic model that takes an entirely different approach to community composition than the niche apportionment models.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; Instead of species populations reaching equilibrium within a community, the UNTB model is dynamic, allowing for continuing changes in relative species abundances through drift.

A community in the UNTB model can be best visualized as a grid with a certain number of spaces, each occupied with individuals of different species.  The model is [[zero-sum]] as there are a limited number of spaces that can be occupied: an increase in the number of individuals of one species in the grid must result in corresponding decrease in the number of individuals of other species in the grid. The model then uses birth, death, immigration, extinction and speciation to modify community composition over time.

;Hubbell's theta

The UNTB model produces a dimensionless "fundamental biodiversity" number,&amp;nbsp;''θ'', which is derived using the formula:

: ''θ'' = 2''J''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;''v''

''where'':

: ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is the size of the metacommunity (the outside source of immigrants to the local community)

:''v'' is the speciation rate in the model

Relative species abundances in the UNTB model follow a zero-sum multinomial distribution.&lt;ref name=Hubbell_Lake&gt;Hubbell, S. P.; Lake J. 2003. "The neutral theory of biogeography and biodiversity: and beyond". In T. Blackburn and K. Gaston, editors, ''Macroecology: concepts and consequences''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of this distribution is a function of the immigration rate, the size of the sampled community (grid), and&amp;nbsp;''θ''.&lt;ref name=Hubbell_Lake/&gt; When the value of ''θ'' is small, the relative species abundance distribution is similar to the geometric series (high dominance). As ''θ'' gets larger, the distribution becomes increasingly s-shaped (log-normal) and, as it approaches infinity, the curve becomes flat (the community has infinite diversity and species abundances of one). Finally, when ''θ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 the community described consists of only one species (extreme dominance).&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;

===== Fisher's alpha and Hubbell's theta – an interesting convergence=====

An unexpected result of the UNTB is that at very large sample sizes, predicted relative species abundance curves describe the [[metacommunity]] and become identical to Fisher's logseries. At this point ''θ'' also becomes identical to Fisher's &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for the equivalent distribution and Fisher's constant ''x'' is equal to the ratio of birthrate : deathrate. Thus, the UNTB unintentionally offers a mechanistic explanation of the logseries 50 years after Fisher first developed his descriptive model.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;

'''High salt marsh dieback''', or salt marsh browning, is the primary force in [[salt marsh]] degradation in the high marsh. The general effect is that the plants in the marsh die off and brown, leaving dead [[organic matter]], and ultimately open [[sediment]].  Without strong plant roots holding the sediment, these open areas of land [[erosion|erode]], causing the salt marsh to retreat back to the mainland.&lt;ref name=Webetal&gt;Webb E.C., Mendelssohn I.A., Wilsey B.J. (1995) "Causes for vegetation dieback in a Louisiana salt marsh: a bioassay approach". ''[[Aquatic Botany]]'' 51: 281–289&lt;/ref&gt; Dieback zones lack their main producers, such as the salt marsh cord grass, or ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]'', and ultimately become completely unproductive.&lt;ref&gt;Bertness M, Silliman B.R., Jefferies R. (2004) "Salt marshes under siege". ''American Scientist'' 92(1): 54&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview of hypotheses ==

Scientists have studied salt marsh dieback for decades, and they still argue about its causes.  One of the main ideas suggests that salt marsh dieback is caused by [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] in ''S. alterniflora'' from increased submersion within the tides, increased sediment, and [[oxygen]] deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman P.J, Williams W.T. (1961) "Investigations into 'die-back' in ''Spartina townsendii'' agg." ''Journal of Ecology'' 49(2): 391–398&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists have researched the possibility of increased [[soil salinity]] and decreased soil water as the causes for dieback.&lt;ref&gt;Brown C.E., Pezeshki S.R. (2007) "Threshold for recovery in the marsh halophyte ''Spartina alterniflora'' grown under the combined effects of salinity and soil drying". ''Journal of Plant Physiology'' 164: 274–282&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance of salt marshes ===

Salt marshes are important in preserving the brooding and nursery habitats of shellfish, fish, and insects.

== Waterlogging hypothesis ==

Waterlogging is the result of too much water in a plant's [[root]] system and the surrounding soil, and usually occurs in the inland areas of the marsh.  With the increase of surface water, waterlogged soils contain many reduced molecules, which can induce the accumulation of sulfide and other toxic compounds.&lt;ref name=MendelssohnMcKee&gt;Mendelssohn I.A., McKee K.L. (1988) "''Spartina alterniflora'' die-back in Louisiana: Time-course investigation of soil waterlogging effects". ''Journal of Ecology'' 76: 509–521&lt;/ref&gt; Current studies suggest that increased waterlogging is caused by [[sea level rise]], a possible effect of [[global warming]], which has many natural and anthropologic causes of its own.&lt;ref name=MendelssohnKuhn&gt;Mendelssohn I.A., Kuhn N.L. (2003) "Sediment subsidy: effects on soil-plant responses in a rapidly submerging coastal salt marsh". ''Ecological Engineering'' 21: 115–128&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reduced aerobic respiration ===

Salt marsh dieback results in the death of marsh-specific plants and the erosion of the landscape. One of the causes of waterlogging is the reduced [[cellular respiration|aerobic respiration]] by the roots of ''S. alterniflora''.  It occurs  mainly in the  inland zones, though the streamside plants show partial anaerobic respiration.

Aerobic respiration takes sugars and oxygen to create carbon dioxide, water, and energy.

As aerobic respiration decreases, the plants become oxygen deficient, since the roots are unable to produce enough oxygen in the reduced soil conditions.  Decreased oxygen uptake can also decrease plant productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelssohn I.A., McKee K.L., Patrick, W.H. (1981) "Oxygen deficiency in ''Spartina alterniflora'' roots: Metabolic adaptation to anoxia". ''Science'' 214: 439–441&lt;/ref&gt;

To gain energy, these plants then go through a process of alcoholic [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] (Mendelssohn et al. 1981).  This fermentation process has an end product of carbon in the form of ethanol, which is diffused from the roots.  Therefore, the plants are unable to use the diffused carbon, so the available plant energy decreases.&lt;ref name=MendelssohnMcKee/&gt;

=== Increased soil sulfide ===

Another product of waterlogging is the increase of [[sulfide]] in soil.  The increase of sulfide is caused by [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] and aerobic bacteria, which are mainly seen in reduced soils.&lt;ref name=MendelssohnKuhn/&gt;

Increased sulfide has been shown to inhibit NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N (ammoniacal nitrogen, an ammonium salt) uptake within the plant.&lt;ref name=MendelssohnMcKee/&gt; NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N is the most available form of [[nitrogen]] within the soil and it is a limiting nutrient in ''S. alterniflora'' productivity.

A higher concentration of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N in the soil may show that the plant's uptake of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N has decreased, leaving excess molecules in the soil.  In addition, reduced soils can cause plant nitrification to decrease, leading to a greater lack of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N uptake.&lt;ref name=Webetal/&gt;

=== Possible solutions ===

Some scientists have found solutions to this problem.  Mendelssohn and Kuhn set up an experiment with plants and soils in a Louisiana salt marsh in 2003.  They found that when sediment deposits are increased within an unhealthy salt marsh area, the plants and soils are in better conditions. 

The experiment showed that the plants with the greater sediment levels had more plant cover, with higher plants and a greater bulk density.  The surface elevation increased with the increase of sediment, therefore reducing flooding.  The roots could respire aerobically, so they did not have to rely on fermentation for energy.  The plants with more sediment also showed a decrease in sulfide and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N concentrations in the soil.  Mendelssohn postulates that since the concentration of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N decreased after the addition of sediment, more of the nitrogen was used by the plants.&lt;ref name=MendelssohnKuhn/&gt;

== Salinity hypothesis ==

A second hypothesis of salt marsh dieback focuses on increased salinity and lack of soil water being the main causes of salt marsh dieback.  Some scientists see this hypothesis as relevant, since global warming suggests that increased global temperatures may lead to increased [[evaporation]] and [[transpiration]].

Brown and Pezeshki devised an experiment in which many ''S. alterniflora'' individuals were put under situations of increased salinity, increased water stress, and then a combined treatment.  They found that those plants that experienced the combined treatment exhibited an increase in water stress, where plants are unable to get a sufficient amount of water from the soil, a decrease in photosynthetic activity, and ultimately death (Brown &amp; Pezeshki 2007).

{{Table Numeral Systems}}
The '''ternary''' [[numeral system]] (also called '''base 3''') has [[3 (number)|three]] as its [[Base (exponentiation)|base]]. Analogous to a [[bit]], a ternary [[numerical digit|digit]] is a '''trit''' ('''tr'''inary dig'''it'''). One trit is equivalent to log₂3 (about 1.58496) bits of [[Units of information|information]].

Although ''ternary'' most often refers to a system in which the three digits are all non–negative numbers, specifically {{num|0}}, {{num|1}}, and {{num|2}}, the adjective also lends its name to the [[balanced ternary]] system, comprising the digits [[−1]], 0 and +1, used in comparison logic and [[ternary computer]]s.

Representations of [[integer number]]s in ternary do not get uncomfortably lengthy as quickly as in [[binary numeral system|binary]]. For example, decimal [[365 (number)|365]] corresponds to binary 101101101 (nine digits) and to ternary 111112 (six digits). However, they are still far less compact than the corresponding representations in bases such as [[decimal]]{{snd}}see below for a compact way to codify ternary using nonary and [[septemvigesimal]].

As for [[rational number]]s, ternary offers a convenient way to represent 1÷3 (as opposed to its cumbersome representation as an infinite string of [[recurring decimal|recurring digits]] in decimal); but a major drawback is that, in turn, ternary does not offer a finite representation for 1÷2 (neither for 1÷4, 1÷8, etc.), because [[2 (number)|2]] is not a [[Prime number|prime]] [[factorization|factor]] of the base; as with base 2, 1÷10 is not representable exactly (that would need e.g. base 10); nor is 1÷6.

===Sum of the digits in ternary as opposed to binary===
The value of a binary number with ''n'' bits that are all 1 is 2''ⁿ''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1.

Similarly, for a number ''N''(''b'', ''d'') with base ''b'' and ''d'' digits, all of which are the maximal digit value ''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1, we can write:

:''N''(''b'', ''d'') = (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1) ''bᵈ''⁻¹ + (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1) ''bᵈ''⁻² + … + (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1) ''b''¹ + (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1) ''b''⁰
,

:''N''(''b'', ''d'') = (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1) (''bᵈ''⁻¹ + ''bᵈ''⁻² + … + ''b''¹ + 1),

:''N''(''b'', ''d'') = (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1) ''M''.

:''bM'' = ''bᵈ'' + ''bᵈ''⁻¹ + … + ''b''² + ''b''¹, and

:-''M'' = -''bᵈ''⁻¹&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;''bᵈ''⁻²&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;b¹&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1, so

:''bM''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;''M'' = ''bᵈ''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1, or

:''M'' = (''bᵈ''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1)÷(''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1).

Then

:''N''(''b'', ''d'') = (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1)''M'',

:''N''(''b'', ''d'') = (''b''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1) (''bᵈ''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1)÷(''b'' &amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1), and

:''N''(''b'', ''d'') = ''bᵈ''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1.

For a three-digit ternary number, ''N''(3, 3) = 3³&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1 = 26 = 2 × 3² + 2 × 3¹ + 2 × 3⁰ = 18 + 6 + 2.

===Compact ternary representation: base 9 and 27===
Nonary (base 9, each digit is two ternary digits) or [[septemvigesimal]] (base 27, each digit is three ternary digits) can be used for compact representation of ternary, similar to how [[octal]] and [[hexadecimal]] systems are used in place of [[binary numeral system|binary]].

==Practical usage==
In certain analog logic, the state of the circuit is often expressed ternary. This is most commonly seen in [[CMOS]] circuits, and also in [[Transistor–transistor logic]] with totem-pole output. The output is said to either be low (grounded), high, or open ([[High impedance|high–Z]]). In this configuration the output of the circuit is actually not connected to any voltage reference at all. Where the signal is usually grounded to a certain reference, or at a certain voltage level, the state is said to be high impedance because it is open and serves its own reference. Thus, the actual voltage level is sometimes unpredictable.

A rare "ternary point" is used to denote fractional parts of an [[inning]] in [[baseball]]. Since each inning consists of three [[Out (baseball)|outs]], each out is considered one third of an inning and is denoted as '''.1'''. For example, if a player pitched all of the 4th, 5th and 6th innings, plus 2 outs of the 7th inning, his [[Innings pitched]] column for that game would be listed as '''3.2''', meaning 3⅔. In this usage, only the fractional part of the number is written in ternary form.

Ternary numbers can be used to convey self–similar structures like the [[Sierpinski triangle]] or the [[Cantor set]] conveniently. Additionally, it turns out that the ternary representation is useful for defining the Cantor set and related point sets, because of the way the Cantor set is constructed. The Cantor set consists of the points from 0 to 1 that have a ternary expression that does not contain any instance of the digit 1.&lt;ref name="Soltanifar_2006_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soltanifar_2006_2"/&gt; Any terminating expansion in the ternary system is equivalent to the expression that is identical up to the term preceding the last non-zero term followed by the term one less than the last nonzero term of the first expression, followed by an infinite tail of twos. For example: .1020 is equivalent to .1012222... because the expansions are the same until the "two" of the first expression, the two was decremented in the second expansion, and trailing zeros were replaced with trailing twos in the second expression.

Ternary is the integer base with the lowest [[radix economy]], followed closely by [[Binary numeral system|binary]] and [[Quaternary numeral system|quaternary]]. It has been used for some computing systems because of this efficiency. It is also used to represent three-option ''trees'', such as phone menu systems, which allow a simple path to any branch.

A form of [[redundant binary representation]] called [[balanced ternary]] or [[signed-digit representation]] is sometimes used in low-level software and hardware to accomplish fast addition of integers because it can eliminate carries.&lt;ref name="Phatak_1994"/&gt;

===Binary-coded ternary===
Simulation of ternary computers using binary computers, or interfacing between ternary and binary computers, can involve use of binary-coded ternary (BCT) numbers, with two bits used to encode each trit.&lt;ref name="Frieder_1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parhami_2013"/&gt; BCT encoding is analogous to [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD) encoding. If the trit values 0, 1 and 2 are encoded 00, 01 and 10, conversion in either direction between binary-coded ternary and binary can be done in [[Time complexity#Logarithmic time|logarithmic time]].&lt;ref name="Jones_2016_1"/&gt; A library of [[C (programming language)|C code]] supporting BCT arithmetic is available.&lt;ref name="Jones_2016_2"/&gt;

===Tryte===
Some [[ternary computer]]s such as the [[Setun]] defined a '''tryte''' to be six trits&lt;ref name="Impagliazzo_2006"/&gt; or approximately 9.5 [[bit]] (holding more information than the ''de facto'' [[Binary number|binary]] [[byte]]).&lt;ref name="Brousentsov_2010"/&gt;

'''Thermogenesis''' is the process of [[heat]] production in organisms.  It occurs in all [[warm-blooded]] animals, and also in a few species of [[thermogenic plants]] such as the [[Eastern skunk cabbage]], the [[Voodoo lily]], and the giant water lilies of the genus ''[[Victoria (plant)|Victoria]]''. The lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe, ''[[Arceuthobium americanum]]''  disperses its seeds explosively through thermogenesis.&lt;ref name="Thermogenesis-triggered seed dispersal"&gt;Rolena A.J. deBruyn, Mark Paetkau, Kelly A. Ross, David V. Godfrey &amp; [[Cynthia Ross Friedman]]. (2015). [http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150209/ncomms7262/full/ncomms7262.html Thermogenesis-triggered seed dispersal in dwarf mistletoe.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Depending on whether or not they are initiated through locomotion and intentional movement of the [[muscle]]s, thermogenic processes can be classified as one of the following:
* Exercise-associated thermogenesis ('''EAT''')
* Non-exercise activity thermogenesis ('''NEAT'''), energy expended for everything that is not sleeping, eating or sports-like exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levine|first1=JA|title=Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT).|journal=Best practice &amp; research. Clinical endocrinology &amp; metabolism|date=December 2002|volume=16|issue=4|pages=679-702|pmid=12468415}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[thermic effect of food|Diet-induced thermogenesis]] ('''DIT''')

===Shivering===
One method to raise temperature is through [[shivering]]. It produces heat because the conversion of the chemical energy of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] into [[kinetic energy]] causes almost all of the energy to show up as heat. Shivering is the process by which the body temperature of hibernating mammals (such as some bats and ground squirrels) is raised as these animals emerge from hibernation.

=== Non-shivering ===
[[File:ThermogeneseAdipozyten-en.svg|thumb|right|Activation cascade of thermogenin in cells of brown adipose tissue]]
Non-shivering thermogenesis occurs in [[brown adipose tissue]] (brown fat)&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Ira Fox. Human Physiology. Twelfth Edition. McGraw Hill. 2011. p. 667.&lt;/ref&gt; that is present in almost all [[eutherian]]s ([[Swine (disambiguation)#Animal|swine]] being the only exception currently known).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayward|first1=John S.|last2=Lisson|first2=Paul A.|title=Evolution of brown fat: its absence in marsupials and monotremes|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1992|volume=70|issue=1|pages=171–179|doi=10.1139/z92-025|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1139%2Fz92-025|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown adipose tissue has a unique [[uncoupling protein]] ([[thermogenin]], also known as uncoupling protein 1) that allows the uncoupling of protons moving down their mitochondrial gradient from the synthesis of ATP, thus allowing the energy to be dissipated as heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=B.|author2=Nedergaard, J. |title=Brown Adipose Tissue: Function and Physiological Significance|pmid=14715917|journal=Physiol. Rev.|year=2004|issue=1|pages=277–359|doi=10.1152/physrev.00015.2003|volume=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this process, substances such as free [[fatty acids]] (derived from triacylglycerols) remove purine (ADP, GDP and others) inhibition of thermogenin, which causes an influx of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the matrix of the [[mitochondrion]] and bypasses the [[ATP synthase]] channel. This uncouples [[oxidative phosphorylation]], and the energy from the [[proton motive force]] is dissipated as [[heat]] rather than producing ATP from ADP, which would store chemical energy for the body's use.  Thermogenesis can also be produced by leakage of the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pump]] and the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morrissette |first1=Jeffery M. |last2=Franck |first2=Jens P. G. |last3=Block |first3=Barbara A. |title=Characterization of ryanodine receptor and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase isoforms in the thermogenic heater organ of blue marlin (''Makaira nigricans'') |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/5/805.short |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=206 |pages=805–812 |date=2003 |issn=0022-0949 |doi=10.1242/jeb.00158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermogenesis is contributed to by [[futile cycle]]s, such as the simultaneous occurrence of [[lipogenesis]] and [[lipolysis]] or [[glycolysis]] and [[gluconeogenesis]].

[[Acetylcholine]] stimulates muscle to raise [[Basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]].&lt;ref name="pmid25976513 "&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Evans SS, Repasky EA, Fisher DT | title=Fever and the thermal regulation of immunity: the immune system feels the heat| journal= [[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=15 | issue=6 | pages=335–349 | year=2015 | doi= 10.1038/nri3843 | pmc=4786079 | PMID = 25976513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The low demands of thermogenesis mean that free fatty acids draw, for the most part, on [[lipolysis]] as the method of energy production.

A comprehensive list of human and mouse genes regulating cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) ''[[in vivo]]'' or ''[[ex vivo]]'' has been curated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=29688375|pmc=5868181|doi=10.1093/database/bay012|title=CITGeneDB: a comprehensive database of human and mouse genes enhancing or suppressing cold-induced thermogenesis validated by perturbation experiments in mice|first1=Jin|last1=Li|first2=Su-Ping|last2=Deng|first3=Gang|last3=Wei|first4=Peng|last4=Yu|journal=[[Database (journal)]]|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is available in [http://citgenedb.yubiolab.org CITGeneDB].

==Regulation==
Non-shivering thermogenesis is regulated mainly by [[thyroid hormone]] and the [[sympathetic nervous system]].  Some hormones, such as [[norepinephrine]] and [[leptin]], may stimulate thermogenesis by activating the sympathetic nervous system.  Rising [[insulin]] levels after eating may be responsible for diet-induced thermogenesis ([[thermic effect of food]]).
Progesterone also increases body temperature.

He was well known throughout the architecture community for his role in the development of [[Postmodern architecture|Contextualism]], along with [[Colin Rowe]], under whom he studied at Cornell; and for his expertise in rationalist Italian architecture.  Schumacher is ranked in the 90th percentile for research in architecture in a survey of over 3,000 architecture professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://papers.archsoc.com/Ratingprofs2010.pdf |title=Rating the Architecture Professors in Research: 2010 Report |publisher=Key Centre for Architectural Sociology |accessdate=September 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913020445/http://papers.archsoc.com/Ratingprofs2010.pdf |archivedate=September 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a registered architect and a member of the [[Society of Architectural Historians]].

==Life, education and career==
Thomas L. Schumacher was born on November 7, 1941, in New York City, and grew up in the Bronx, where he attended the now defunct [[William Howard Taft High School (New York City)|Wm. Howard Taft High School]], graduating in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taftreunion1958.myevent.com/3/custom_form.htm |title=Gone Too Soon II |accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schumacher Attended [[Cornell University]] where he earned a Bachelor of Architecture in 1963 and a Master of Architecture in 1966.  His M.Arch thesis, "South Amboy new town; an exercise in urban form", was directed by Colin Rowe and was influential in the development of the contextualism school of thought.  Schumacher was awarded the Rome Prize for architecture in 1967, studying at the American Academy in Rome until 1969.  In 1977, he became a registered architect in the state of New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newjersey.mylicense.com/verification/Details.aspx?agency_id=1&amp;license_id=44583&amp; |title=State of New Jersey Department of Consumer Affairs License Search |publisher=newjersey.mylicense.com |accessdate=September 12, 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Plant Breeding (IPB)''' is a research institute of the [[University of the Philippines Los Baños]]. It is the national [[biotechnology]] research center and repository for all crops other than [[rice]], which is handled by the [[Philippine Rice Research Institute]].

It traces its roots to the [[Plant Breeding]] Division of the Department of [[Agronomy]], [[UPLB College of Agriculture|College of Agriculture]]. In 1975, President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] elevated the Division to an Institute and provided additional funds for new facilities and expanded research initiatives.

==Core functions==
*Develop new and improved varieties of dryland crops
*Conduct studies in plant breeding and allied disciplines related to crop improvement
*Collect, introduce, preserve, and maintain germplasm of important and potentially useful agricultural and horticultural crops
*Assist other agencies in multiplying quality seeds and vegetative materials of recommended crop varieties
*Promote widescale use of IPB varieties and ensure that seeds are made available to small farmers

==Divisions and laboratories==
*Cereal Crops Division
*Feed and Industrial Crops Division
*Fruit and Ornamental Crops Division
*Legume Crops Division
*Vegetables and Special Crops Division
*Plant Pathology Laboratory
*Entomology Laboratory
*Plant Physiology Laboratory
*Extension Division
*Genetics Laboratory
*National Plant Genetic Resources Laboratory
*Biochemistry Laboratory
*Plant Cell and Tissue Culture Laboratory
*National Seed Foundation

==Samples of IPB research==
*'''Papaya Ringspot Virus (PSRV)-Resistant'''
This variety is a genetically-enhanced [[papaya]] with PRSV resistance and delayed ripening trait. This trait will help reduce post-harvest losses due to spoilage which is another major problem to farmers. The first and second generation papayas had been previously subjected to polymerase chain reaction analysis, which indicated that the lines contain a copy of the PRSV coat protein gene. A third generation papaya is currently under development.

*'''Fruit and Shoot Borer Resistant Eggplant'''
Initial crosses had already been made between Indian transgenic [[eggplants]] and selected Philippine varieties Mara, Mistisa, Dumaguete Long Purple, and Casino. The progeny of these crosses were then back-crossed with their Philippine variety parent in [[India]].

*'''Multiple Virus Resistant Tomato'''
The multiple virus resistant project aims to combine transgenic technologies for Cucumber Mosaic Virus with conventional resistance against Tomato Leaf Curl Virus (ToLCV) to produce commercial tomato varieties. After introgression lines and appropriate controls were supplied by IPB partners, these tomato lines were screened to identify the genome regions that confer resistance against each local ToLCV. Reliable DNA markers are also being developed for each identified genome (introgression) region.

*'''Mutation Breeding of Philippine Avocado'''
Although engaged in [[genetic engineering]], the Institute also uses mutation breeding, which is an alternative method of improving crop varieties. Small portions of [[avocado]] plant tissue (embryos) were allowed to grow (embryogenic cultures) and to differentiate into somatic embryos and shoots. Some of the plant tissue cultures were subjected to gamma irradiation to facilitate mutation from the regenerated plant tissue cultures. During the irradiation, some cells were killed and those capable of regrowth were multiplied. The surviving cells were grown to produce somatic embryos and shoots. The shoots from irradiated and non-irradiated tissues were then treated in a [[test tube]] environment to promote root growth and prepare them for natural growth environment. The IPB is currently undertaking the rooting and potting out of the plantlets to enable maximum recovery. The established regenerated plants will then be transferred to the greenhouse, and finally to the field for further evaluation.
