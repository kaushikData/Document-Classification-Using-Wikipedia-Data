The '''Agrarian People's Union''' ({{lang-bg|земеделски народен съюз}}, ''Zemedelski Naroden Sajuz'', ZNS), until 2006 known as the Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union – People's Union (Balgarski Zemedelski Naroden Sajuz – Naroden Sajuz, BZNS-NS), is a [[conservative]] [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] party in [[Bulgaria]]. 

It was founded in 1996 by a faction of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union]] led by [[Anastasia Dimitrova-Moser]]. It contested the parliamentary election in 1997 and 2001 within the center-right [[United Democratic Forces]]. In 2005 it was part of the [[Bulgarian People's Union]], that won at the [[legislative]] [[elections in Bulgaria|elections]], 25 June 2005, 5.7% of the popular vote and 13 out of 240 seats.

The party is a former observer of the [[Centrist Democrat International]] (CDI).

An '''all call''' is a general term for a [[broadcast]] message. In particular, it may be used to refer to an automated [[Telephone|phone]] [[notification system]] that will quickly call individuals with a recorded message in the event of a [[Weather-related cancellation|weather-related school closing]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.viennahighschool.com/allcallsysteminformation.htm&lt;/ref&gt; or emergency situation.

An example of an ALL-CALL in a school would be, "Please excuse the interruption, please report to the Auditorium at this time. Thank you." 

On a Norstar system, you can make an "ALL-CALL" by entering Feature 60 BOTH ALL. This will broadcast a message throughout the entire campus. 

On Panasonic systems, you can make an "ALL-CALL" by entering the numbers 339. This activates the entire campus' paging devices.

An "ALL-CALL" function may also be referred to as a "PAGE".

The first meeting of an enduring municipal association was held in Hamilton on September 6, 1899. The name "Ontario Municipal Association" was chosen, and it was agreed that there would be annual meetings, or "oftener if need be, upon the call of the executive committee", so that both appointed and elected representatives of municipalities could discuss common concerns. A constitution for the organization was drawn up, officers elected and the mandate decided ‑ to establish regular meetings between the association and the government to speak to, and to influence legislation.

The Association of Municipalities of Ontario was created through the merger and reconstitution of the Ontario Municipal Association and the Ontario Association of Mayors and Reeves on June 22, 1972. Further organizational change continued to be discussed in the late 1970s when exploratory meetings were held between AMO and two other major municipal organizations which also existed at that time: The Rural Ontario Municipal Association and The Association of Counties and Regions. Discussions were also held with affiliated associations: The Organization of Small Urban Municipalities (OSUM), The Association of District Municipalities, The Federation of Northern Ontario Municipalities (FONOM), and The Northwestern Ontario Municipal Association (NOMA).

In February 1980, an Association Review Committee was struck and presented its report in June 1980. A new association of municipal representatives was proposed, consisting of five sections, "restructured to ensure accurate representation of the positions of the different types of municipalities in the province". The newly constituted Association of Municipalities of Ontario came into being on January 1, 1982. In May 1990 AMO became formally incorporated without share capital. AMO's constitution was re‑formulated into governing By‑law No. 1. The By‑law has been amended a number of times to implement significant changes to the Association.

==Mandate==
The mandate of the organization is to support and enhance strong and effective municipal government in Ontario. It promotes the value of the municipal level of government as a vital and essential component of Ontario and Canada's political system.

The Mandate is delivered in a variety of ways. Of particular importance is the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between AMO and the Province. The MOU provides the opportunity for municipal input and reaction to provincial policy ideas (pre-consultation) so that they are fully informed as part of any provincial policy making process. The MOU also includes a Protocol that obligates the Province to consult with AMO and municipalities on matters that are of a federal-provincial nature that could affect municipal services and finances.  The Protocol also sets out the Province's commitment to pursue a federal-provincial-municipal framework where municipalities have a 'seat at the federal-provincial table.'" &lt;ref&gt;Association of Municipalities of Ontario http://amo.on.ca/About.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The activities of AMO support both its Mandate and Vision Statement.  AMO develops policy positions and reports on issues of general interest to municipal governments; conducts ongoing liaison with provincial government elected and non-elected representatives; informs and educates governments, the media and the public on municipal issues; markets innovative and beneficial services to the municipal sector; and maintains a resource centre on issues of municipal interest. The Association's Annual Meeting is held in August and is combined with a comprehensive conference program.

==Organizational Structure==
The governing body of the Association is the Board of Directors, elected every two years at the Association's Annual Meeting. The Board comprise 43 elected and non-elected municipal representatives which meets five times per year. An Executive Committee of the Board, responsible for the business of the Association between Board of Director meetings, meets monthly.

AMO hosts many foreign delegates who wish to learn about starting a similar local government organization and our business and information services.

'''Aung San Suu Kyi''' ({{IPAc-en|aʊ|ŋ|ˌ|s|æ|n|.|s|uː|ˈ|tʃ|iː}}; {{MYname|MY=အောင်ဆန်းစုကြည်|MLCTS=aung hcan: cu. krany}} {{IPA-my|àʊɴ sʰáɴ sṵ tɕì}}; born 19 June 1945) is a [[Myanmar|Burmese]] politician, diplomat, author, and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate (1991). She is the leader of the [[National League for Democracy]] and the first and incumbent [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]], a position akin to a prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41139319|title=Johnson warns Suu Kyi over Rohingya|date=3 September 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also the [[List of female foreign ministers|first woman]] to serve as Minister for [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Myanmar)|Foreign Affairs]], for the [[Office of the President of Myanmar|President's Office]], for Electric Power and Energy, and for [[Ministry of Education (Myanmar)|Education]]. From 2012 to 2016 she was an [[member of parliament|MP]] for [[Kawhmu Township]] to the [[House of Representatives (Myanmar)|House of Representatives]].

The youngest daughter of [[Aung San]], [[Father of the Nation]] of modern-day Myanmar, and [[Khin Kyi]], Aung San Suu Kyi was born in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]]. After graduating from the [[University of Delhi]] in 1964 and the [[University of Oxford]] in 1968, she worked at the [[United Nations]] for three years. She married [[Michael Aris]] in 1972, with whom she had two children. Aung San Suu Kyi rose to prominence in the [[8888 Uprising|1988 Uprisings]], and became the General Secretary of the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD), which she had newly formed with the help of several retired army officials who criticized the military junta. In the [[Burmese general election, 1990|1990 elections]], NLD won 81% of the seats in Parliament, but the results were nullified, as the [[State Peace and Development Council|military]] refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. She had, however, already been detained under [[house arrest]] before the elections. She remained under house arrest for almost 15 of the 21 years from 1989 to 2010, becoming one of the world's most prominent [[political prisoner]]s.

Her party boycotted the [[Myanmar general election, 2010|2010 elections]], resulting in a decisive victory for the military-backed [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]]. Aung San Suu Kyi became a [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] while her party won 43 of the 45 vacant seats in the [[Burmese by-elections, 2012|2012 by-elections]]. In the [[Myanmar general election, 2015|2015 elections]], her party won a [[landslide victory]], taking 86% of the seats in the [[Assembly of the Union]] – well more than the 67 percent [[supermajority]] needed to ensure that its preferred candidates were elected [[President of Myanmar|President]] and [[Vice President of Myanmar|Second Vice President]] in the [[Presidential Electoral College]]. Although she was prohibited from becoming the President due to a clause in [[Constitution of Myanmar|the constitution]] – her late husband and children are foreign citizens – she assumed the newly created role of [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]], a role akin to a [[Prime Minister of Myanmar|Prime Minister]] or a [[head of government]].

[[File:Khin Kyi and family.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A portrait of Khin Kyi and her family in 1948. Aung San Suu Kyi is seated on the floor.]]
Aung San Suu Kyi was born on 19 June 1945 in Rangoon (now [[Yangon]]), British Burma. According to Peter Popham, she was born in a small village outside Rangoon called Hmway Saung.&lt;ref name="Popham"&gt;{{cite book |last=Popham |first=Peter |date=April 2013 |title=The Lady and the Peacock: The Life of Aung San Suu Kyi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCL1drLmsmQC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;q=%22hmway%20saung%22 |location=New York, NY |publisher=The Experiment, LLC |page=163 |isbn=978-1-61519-081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, [[Aung San]], founded the [[Tatmadaw|modern Burmese army]] and negotiated Burma's independence from the [[British Empire]] in 1947; he was [[Burmese Martyrs' Day|assassinated by his rivals]] in the same year. She grew up with her mother, [[Khin Kyi]], and two brothers, Aung San Lin and [[Aung San Oo]], in Rangoon. Aung San Lin died at the age of eight, when he drowned in an ornamental lake on the grounds of [[Bogyoke Aung San Museum|the house]].&lt;ref name="Nobel.org" /&gt; Her elder brother emigrated to [[San Diego]], California, becoming a [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizen]].&lt;ref name="Nobel.org" /&gt; After Aung San Lin's death, the family moved to [[54 University Avenue|a house]] by [[Inya Lake]] where Aung San Suu Kyi met people of various backgrounds, political views and religions.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart (1997), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated in [[Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon|Methodist English High School]] (now Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon) for much of her childhood in Burma, where she was noted as having a talent for learning languages.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart (1997), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; She speaks four languages: Burmese, English, French and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Aung San Suu Kyi: A Biography, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; She is a [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhist]].

Suu Kyi's mother, [[Khin Kyi]], gained prominence as a political figure in the newly formed Burmese government. She was appointed Burmese ambassador to [[India]] and [[Nepal]] in 1960, and Aung San Suu Kyi followed her there.

In 1988, Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma, at first to tend for her ailing mother but later to lead the pro-democracy movement. Aris' visit in Christmas 1995 turned out to be the last time that he and Aung San Suu Kyi met, as Aung San Suu Kyi remained in Burma and the Burmese dictatorship denied him any further entry visas.&lt;ref name = "azjarp" /&gt; Aris was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] in 1997 which was later found to be [[terminal illness|terminal]]. Despite appeals from prominent figures and organizations, including the United States, UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] and [[Pope John Paul II]], the Burmese government would not grant Aris a [[visa (document)|visa]], saying that they did not have the facilities to care for him, and instead urged Aung San Suu Kyi to leave the country to visit him. She was at that time temporarily free from [[house arrest]] but was unwilling to depart, fearing that she would be refused re-entry if she left, as she did not trust the [[military junta]]'s assurance that she could return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/304497.stm Suu Kyi rejects UK visit offer].

==Political career==

===Political beginning===
Coincidentally, when Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma in 1988, the long-time military leader of Burma and head of the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party|ruling party]], General [[Ne Win]], stepped down. Mass demonstrations for democracy followed that event on 8 August 1988 (8–8–88, a day seen as auspicious), which were violently suppressed in what came to be known as the [[8888 Uprising]]. On 26 August 1988, she addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] in the capital, calling for a democratic government.&lt;ref name="azjarp" /&gt; However, in September, a [[State Peace and Development Council|new military junta]] took power.

Offered freedom if she left the country, she refused. Despite her philosophy of non-violence, a group of ex-military commanders and senior politicians who joined NLD during the crisis believed that she was too confrontational and left NLD. However, she retained enormous popularity and support among NLD youths with whom she spent most of her time.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite journal | title=Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar: A Review of the Lady's Biographies | author=Kyaw Yin Hlaing | journal=Contemporary Southeast Asia: A Journal of International &amp; Strategic Affairs |date=August 2007  | volume=29 | issue=2 | page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her time under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi devoted herself to Buddhist meditation practices and to studying Buddhist thought. This deeper interest in Buddhism is reflected in her writings as more emphasis is put on love and compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Voice of Hope: Conversations with Alan Clements | author=Aung San Suu Kyi | publisher=Seven Stories Press | year=1998 | page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also emerged more discussion on the compatibility of democracy and Buddhism and the ability of gaining freedom from an authoritarian government through Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Buddhist Political Rhetoric of Aung San Suu Kyi | author=Stephen McCarthy | journal=Contemporary Buddhism |year=2004 | volume=5 | page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the crisis, the previous democratically elected Prime Minister of Burma, [[U Nu]], initiated to form an interim government and invited opposition leaders to join him. Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] had signaled his readiness to recognize the interim government. However, Aung San Suu Kyi categorically rejected U Nu's plan by saying "the future of the opposition would be decided by masses of the people". Ex-Brigadier General [[Aung Gyi]], another influential politician at the time of the 8888 crisis and the first chairman in the history of the NLD, followed the suit and rejected the plan after Aung San Suu Kyi's refusal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Aung San Suu Kyi: Between Biographical Myth and Hard Realities | author=Susanne Prager-Nyein | journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia |date=February 2013 | volume=3 | issue=43 | pages=546–554 | doi=10.1080/00472336.2013.771942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aung Gyi later accused several NLD members of being communists and resigned from the party.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

In 1990, the military junta called a [[Burmese general election, 1990|general election]], in which the National League for Democracy (NLD) received 59% of the votes, guaranteeing NLD 80% of the parliament seats.

Instead, the results were nullified and the military refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest at her home on University Avenue ({{Coord|16|49|32|N|96|9|1|E|region:MM_type:landmark}}) in Rangoon, during which time she was awarded the [[Sakharov Prize]] for Freedom of Thought in 1990, and the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] the year after. Her sons [[Alexander Aris|Alexander]] and Kim accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf.

... Suu Kyi's struggle is one of the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent decades. She has become an important symbol in the struggle against oppression ...

... In awarding the Nobel Peace Prize for 1991 to Aung San Suu Kyi, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to honour this woman for her unflagging efforts and to show its support for the many people throughout the world who are striving to attain democracy, human rights and ethnic conciliation by peaceful means.|Oslo, 14 October 1991}}

In 1995 Aung San Suu Kyi delivered the keynote address at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing.&lt;ref name="nobelprize.org"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=nobelprize.org |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991/kyi-bio.html |title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1991 |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996 attack===
On 9 November 1996, the [[motorcade]] that Aung San Suu Kyi was traveling in with other [[National League for Democracy]] leaders [[Tin Oo]] and [[Kyi Maung]], was attacked in Yangon. About 200 men swooped down on the motorcade, wielding metal chains, metal batons, stones and other weapons. The car that Aung San Suu Kyi was in had its rear window smashed, and the car with Tin Oo and Kyi Maung had its rear window and two backdoor windows shattered. It is believed the offenders were members of the [[Union Solidarity and Development Association]] (USDA) who were allegedly paid 500 [[kyat]]s (@ USD $0.50) each to participate. The NLD lodged an official complaint with the police, and according to reports the government launched an investigation, but no action was taken. ([[Amnesty International]] 120297)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aappb.org/biography_1.html|title=Aung San Suu Kyi profile|publisher=Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma)|accessdate=5 November 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104202315/http://www.aappb.org/biography_1.html|archivedate=4 November 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House arrest===
Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under [[house arrest]] for a total of 15 years over a 21-year period, on numerous occasions, since she began her political career,&lt;ref name=sk&gt;Moe, Wait (3 August 2009). [http://www2.irrawaddy.org/highlight.php?art_id=16470 Suu Kyi Questions Burma's Judiciary, Constitution]. ''[[The Irrawaddy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; during which time she was prevented from meeting her party supporters and international visitors. In an interview, she said that while under house arrest she spent her time reading philosophy, politics and biographies that her husband had sent her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZFpURJGv00&amp;feature=related Aung San Suu Kyi interview (video)]. YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; She also passed the time playing the piano, and was occasionally allowed visits from foreign diplomats as well as from her personal physician.&lt;ref&gt;Buncombe, Andrew (5 July 2009). [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/5000-days-in-captivity-the-worlds-most-famous-political-prisoner-and-a-dismal-landmark-1731998.html 5,000 days in captivity: The world's most famous political prisoner and a dismal landmark]. ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi was granted permission to leave Burma under the condition that she never return, which she refused: "As a mother, the greater sacrifice was giving up my sons, but I was always aware of the fact that others had given up more than me. I never forget that my colleagues who are in prison suffer not only physically, but mentally for their families who have no security outside- in the larger prison of Burma under authoritarian rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Voice of Hope: Conversations with Alan Clements|author=Aung San Suu Kyi|year=1998|publisher=Seven Stories Press|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her loyalty to the people of Burma and her solidarity with those imprisoned for their pro-democratic acts have earned her deep respect among the Burmese people.

The media were also prevented from visiting Aung San Suu Kyi, as occurred in 1998 when journalist [[Maurizio Giuliano]], after photographing her, was stopped by customs officials who then confiscated all his films, tapes and some notes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=BBAB&amp;d_place=BBAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F98E4ECFAA2A5EF&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Burma expels Italian reporter for "illegal reporting], TV Myanmar, Rangoon, 18 August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Aung San Suu Kyi did have visits from government representatives, such as during her autumn 1994 house arrest when she met the leader of Burma, General [[Than Shwe]] and General [[Khin Nyunt]] on 20 September in the first meeting since she had been placed in detention.&lt;ref name="azjarp" /&gt; On several occasions during her house arrest, she had periods of poor health and as a result was hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick |last=Wadhams|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060901000.html |title=Myanmar's Suu Kyi Hospitalized |agency=Associated Press |work=The Washington Post |date=9 June 2006 |accessdate=9 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burmese government detained and kept Aung San Suu Kyi imprisoned because it viewed her as someone "likely to undermine the community peace and stability" of the country, and used both Article 10(a) and 10(b) of the 1975 State Protection Act (granting the government the power to imprison people for up to five years without a trial),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=5798 Opposition Condemns Extension of Suu Kyi's Detention], The Irrawaddy, 27 May 2006.

===United Nations involvement===
The United Nations (UN) has attempted to facilitate dialogue between the [[military junta|junta]] and Aung San Suu Kyi.&lt;ref name = "azjarp"/&gt; On 6 May 2002, following secret confidence-building negotiations led by the UN, the government released her; a government spokesman said that she was free to move "because we are confident that we can trust each other". Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed "a new dawn for the country". However, on 30 May 2003 in an incident similar to the 1996 attack on her, a [[Depayin massacre|government-sponsored mob attacked]] her caravan in the northern village of [[Tabayin|Depayin]], murdering and wounding many of her supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseanmp.org/resources/Depayin%20Massacre.pdf |title=The Depayin Massacre 2 Years On, Justice Denied |accessdate=4 February 2007 |date=30 May 2005 |format=PDF |publisher=ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Burma Caucus |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614185341/http://www.aseanmp.org/resources/Depayin%20Massacre.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aung San Suu Kyi fled the scene with the help of her driver, Kyaw Soe Lin, but was arrested upon reaching [[Ye-U]]. The government imprisoned her at [[Insein Prison]] in Rangoon. After she underwent a [[hysterectomy]] in September 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3119038.stm | title =Suu Kyi has 'major' operation |publisher=BBC News | date =19 September 2003 | accessdate =4 July 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government again placed her under house arrest in Rangoon.

The results from the UN facilitation have been mixed; [[Razali Ismail]], UN special envoy to Burma, met with Aung San Suu Kyi. Ismail resigned from his post the following year, partly because he was denied re-entry to Burma on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://english.dvb.no/news.php?id=6287 | title =Annan expresses sadness for the resignation of his envoy for Burma | publisher=Democratic Voice of Burma | date =10 January 2006 | accessdate =4 July 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928172156/http://english.dvb.no/news.php?id=6287 |archivedate = 28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later in 2006, [[Ibrahim Gambari]], UN [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Undersecretary-General]] (USG) of [[United Nations Department of Political Affairs|Department of Political Affairs]], met with Aung San Suu Kyi, the first visit by a foreign official since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=20 May 2006 |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=18557&amp;Cr=Myanmar&amp;Cr1= |title=After meeting Aung San Suu Kyi, UN envoy leaves Burma|publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 May 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060528170633/http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=18557&amp;Cr=Myanmar&amp;Cr1=| archivedate= 28 May 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also met with Suu Kyi later the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/International/2006/11/11/010-emissaire-suukyi.shtml |title=Rare visite |accessdate=12 January 2007 |date=8 January 2007 |publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 2007 Gambari returned to talk to her again after seeing [[Than Shwe]] and other members of the senior leadership in [[Naypyidaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UN envoy meets with Burma's top general to discuss 'current situation' |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=24129 |publisher=UN News Service |date=2 October 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[State television]] broadcast Aung San Suu Kyi with Gambari, stating that they had met twice. This was Aung San Suu Kyi's first appearance in state media in the four years since her current detention began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burma junta releases footage of Suu Kyi (AFP) |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/06/2052595.htm |publisher=ABC News (Australia) |date=6 October 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2007 |language=en | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011095451/http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/06/2052595.htm| archivedate= 11 October 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Working Group for Arbitrary Detention published an Opinion that Aung San Suu Kyi's deprivation of liberty was arbitrary and in contravention of Article 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] 1948, and requested that the authorities in Burma set her free, but the authorities ignored the request at that time.&lt;ref name="unWrkGrp"&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/wgad/9-2004.html Daw Aung San Suu Kyi v. Myanmar], U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, U.N. Doc. E/CN.4/2005/6/Add.1 at 47 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The U.N. report said that according to the Burmese Government's reply, "Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has not been arrested, but has only been taken into protective custody, for her own safety", and while "it could have instituted legal action against her under the country's domestic legislation&amp;nbsp; ... it has preferred to adopt a magnanimous attitude, and is providing her with protection in her own interests".&lt;ref name="unWrkGrp" /&gt;

Such claims were rejected by Brig-General [[Khin Yi]], Chief of [[Myanmar Police Force]] (MPF). On 18 January 2007, the [[State media|state-run]] paper ''[[New Light of Myanmar]]'' accused Suu Kyi of [[tax evasion]] for spending her Nobel Prize money outside the country. The accusation followed the defeat of a US-sponsored [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution condemning Burma as a threat to international security; the resolution was defeated because of strong opposition from China, which has strong ties with the military junta (China later voted against the resolution, along with Russia and South Africa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/world/asia/19myanmar.html |title=Burmese Daily at Odds With Democracy Advocate |author=Mydans, Seth |accessdate=19 January 2007 |date=18 January 2008 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, it was reported that Aung San Suu Kyi would meet her political allies [[National League for Democracy]] along with a government minister. The ruling junta made the official announcement on state TV and radio just hours after UN special envoy [[Ibrahim Gambari]] ended his second visit to Burma. The NLD confirmed that it had received the invitation to hold talks with Suu Kyi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7085292.stm |title=Suu Kyi to meet party colleagues|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 November 2007|date=8 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071109163856/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7085292.stm| archivedate= 9 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the process delivered few concrete results.

On 3 July 2009, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] went to Burma to pressure the junta into releasing Aung San Suu Kyi and to institute democratic reform. However, on departing from Burma, Ban Ki-moon said he was "disappointed" with the visit after junta leader [[Than Shwe]] refused permission for him to visit Aung San Suu Kyi, citing her ongoing trial. Ban said he was "deeply disappointed that they have missed a very important opportunity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Heilprin |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/05/un-chief-leaves-myanmar-039disappointed039-with-junta.html |title=UN chief leaves Myanmar 'disappointed' with junta |work=The Jakarta Post |date=5 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714054213/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/05/un-chief-leaves-myanmar-039disappointed039-with-junta.html |archivedate=14 July 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions were held between Suu Kyi and the Burmese government during 2011, which led to a number of official gestures to meet her demands. In October, around a tenth of Burma's political prisoners were freed in an amnesty and trade unions were legalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma frees dozens of political prisoners|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15269259|accessdate=19 November 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma law to allow labour unions and strikes|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15303968|accessdate=19 November 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2011, Thai Prime Minister [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] met Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangoon, marking Aung San Suu Kyi's "first-ever meeting with the leader of a foreign country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PM Yingluck backs Suu Kyi in landmark Myanmar talks|url=http://www.manager.co.th/Home/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9540000162276|newspaper=WBDJ7|date=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2012, British Foreign Minister William Hague met Aung San Suu Kyi and his Burmese counterpart. This represented a significant visit for Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi studied in the UK and maintains many ties there, whilst Britain is Burma's largest bilateral donor.
During Aung San Suu Kyi's visit to Europe, she visited the Swiss parliament, collected her 1991 Nobel Prize in Oslo and her honorary degree from Oxford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18454243 | title=Aung San Suu Kyi to visit Swiss parliament | date=15 June 2012 | publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she and other MP-elects were expected to take office on 23 April when the Hluttaws resumed session, National League for Democracy MP-elects, including Aung San Suu Kyi, said they might not take their oaths because of its wording; in its present form, parliamentarians must vow to "safeguard" the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/20/us-myanmar-idUSBRE83J0AI20120420|title=Suu Kyi Myanmar parliament debut in doubt over oath stalemate|author=Aung Hla Tun|date=20 April 2012|agency=Reuters|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The line in question is Schedule Four of the 2008 Constitution (Form of Oaths or Affirmation), which states: "After being elected as an MP, I do solemnly swear to preserve, protect, and nurture the Constitution while following the nation's laws."

The NLD won a sweeping victory in those elections, winning at least 255 seats in the House of Representatives and 135 seats in the House of Nationalities. In addition, Aung San Suu Kyi won re-election to the House of Representatives. Under the 2008 constitution, the NLD needed to win at least a two-thirds majority in both houses to ensure that its candidate would become president. Before the elections, Aung San Suu Kyi announced that even though she is constitutionally barred from the presidency, she would hold the real power in any NLD-led government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Wins Majority in Myanmar |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34805806 |accessdate=13 November 2015 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 March 2016 she became Minister for the President's Office, for Foreign Affairs, for Education and for Electric Power and Energy in President [[Htin Kyaw]]'s government; later she relinquished the latter two ministries and President Htin Kyaw appointed her [[State Counsellor (Myanmar)|State Counsellor]], a position akin to a [[Prime Minister of Myanmar|Prime Minister]] created especially for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/burmese/burma/2016/03/160321_dassk_foreign_minister|title=ဒေါ်စု နိုင်ငံခြားရေးဝန်ကြီး ဖြစ်လာမလား|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VOA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://editorials.voa.gov/content/burmese-parliamentary-elections-146265885/1493313.html |title=Burmese Parliamentary Elections |date=4 April 2012 |publisher=Voice of America News |accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NLD Claims Suu Kyi Victory"&gt;[http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/1661 NLD Claims Suu Kyi Victory], The Irrawaddy, 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign Minister and State Counsellor (2016–present)===
[[File:The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi receiving the State Counsellor of Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi, in Hyderabad House, New Delhi on January 24, 2018.jpg|thumb|Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] meeting Aung San Suu Kyi in New Delhi, 24 January 2018]]
As soon as she became foreign minister, she invited Chinese Foreign Minister [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi]], Canadian Foreign Minister [[Stephane Dion]] and Italian Foreign Minister [[Paolo Gentiloni]] in April and Japanese Foreign Minister [[Fumio Kishida]] in May and discussed to have good diplomatic relationships with these countries.{{citation needed|date= May 2016}}

Initially, upon accepting the State Counsellor position, she granted amnesty to the students who were arrested for opposing the [[Myanmar National Education Law 2014|National Education Bill]], and announced a creation of the commission on [[Rakhine state]], which had a long record of persecution of the Muslim [[Rohingya]] minority. However, soon Aung San Suu Kyi's government did not manage with the ethnic conflicts in [[Shan state|Shan]] and [[Kachin state]]s, where thousands of refugees fled to China, and by 2017 the [[2017 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar|persecution of the Rohingya by the government forces]] escalated to the point that it is not uncommonly called a genocide. Aung San Suu Kyi, when interviewed, has denied the allegations of ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/31/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmars-great-hope-fails-to-live-up-to-expectations|title=Aung San Suu Kyi: Myanmar's great hope fails to live up to expectations|last=McPherson|first=Poppy|date=31 March 2017|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-39510271|title=Myanmar: Aung San Suu Kyi exclusive interview|last=Keane|first=Fergal|date=5 April 2017|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also refused to grant citizenship to the Rohingya, instead taking steps to issue ID cards for residency but no guarantees of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-myanmar-rohingya-2017-story.html|title=Myanmar's long-suffering Rohingya Muslims hoped that Aung San Suu Kyi would make them full citizens.

Her tenure as State Counsellor of Myanmar has drawn international criticism for her failure to address her country's economic and ethnic problems, particularly the plight of the [[Rohingya]] following the [[Northern Rakhine State clashes#25 August 2017 ARSA attacks|25 August 2017 ARSA attacks]] (described as "certainly one of the biggest refugee crises and cases of ethnic cleansing since the [[second world war]]"), for the weakening of [[freedom of the press]] and for her style of leadership, described as imperious and "distracted and out of touch".&lt;ref name="veconomist5" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Is the world getting Myanmar wrong?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21730684-future-not-long-ago-deemed-bright-now-feels-bleak-world-getting-myanmar-wrong|work=[[The Economist]]|date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press freedom is waning in Myanmar|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21738413-no-law-too-obscure-tool-silence-awkward-journalists-press-freedom-waning-myanmar|accessdate=9 March 2018|work=[[The Economist]]|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to violence against Rohingya Muslims and refugees====
In 2017, critics have called for Aung San Suu Kyi's Nobel prize to be revoked, citing her silence over the [[Rohingya persecution in Myanmar (2016–present)|persecution of Rohingya people]] in Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/asia/should-aung-san-suu-kyi-give-back-her-nobel-peace-prize/news-story/2a2e214551ba4e490b99116c5a9fc406|title=Should Aung San Suu Kyi give back her Nobel Peace Prize?|work=News.com.au|date=6 September 2017|accessdate=6 September 2017|first=Kirrily|last=Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/04/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-suu-kyi-.html?mcubz=3|title=Why Aung San Suu Kyi's Nobel Peace Prize Won't Be Revoked|work=The New York Times|date=4 September 2017|accessdate=6 September 2017|first=Russell|last=Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 BBC News article, reporter [[Jonah Fisher]] suggested that Aung San Suu Kyi's silence over the Rohingya issue is due to a need to obtain support from the majority [[Bamar people|Bamar]] ethnicity as she is in "the middle of [[Myanma general election, 2015|a general election]] campaign".&lt;ref name="bbcfisher"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-32974061|title=Aung San Suu Kyi: Where are you?|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] publicly called upon her to do more to help the Rohingya in Myanmar, claiming that he had previously urged her to address the plight of the Rohingya in private during two separate meetings and that she had resisted his urging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dalai Lama presses Aung San Suu Kyi over Rohingya migrants|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32925805|accessdate=3 June 2015|publisher=BBC|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi asked the newly appointed [[United States Ambassador to Myanmar]], [[Scot Marciel]], not to refer to the Rohingya by that name as they "are not recognized as among the 135 official ethnic groups" in Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-aung-san-suu-kyi.html?_r=0 | title=Aung San Suu Kyi Asks U.S. Not to Refer to Rohingya | date=6 May 2016 | accessdate=7 May 2016 | publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed [[Bamar people|Bamar]] protests at Marciel's use of the word "Rohingya".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sanctions on Myanmar|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21699166-america-tweaks-sanctions-not-wholly-democratic-country-not-clear-yet|accessdate=20 May 2016|work=The Economist|date=20 May 2016|quote=Suu Kyi unsettled Western diplomats (who not long ago used unequivocally to adore her) when she asked the new American ambassador not to refer to a persecuted Muslim minority by their name, the Rohingyas.

In 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi was accused of failing to protect Myanmar's [[Rohingya people|Rohingya Muslims]] during the [[2016–17 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar|2016–17 persecution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/17/asia/myanmar-rohingya-aung-san-suu-kyi/ Is The Lady listening?

In early October 2018, both the Canadian Senate and its House of Commons voted unanimously to strip Aung San Suu Kyi of her honourary citizenship.

Asked what democratic models Myanmar could look to, she said: "We have many, many lessons to learn from various places, not just the [[Asian countries]] like [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Indonesia]]." She also cited "the [[eastern European]] countries, which made the transition from communist autocracy to democracy in the 1980s and 1990s, and the [[Latin American]] countries, which made the transition from military governments. "And we cannot of course forget South Africa, because although it wasn't a military regime, it was certainly an authoritarian regime." She added: "We wish to learn from everybody who has achieved a transition to democracy, and also&amp;nbsp; ... our great strong point is that, because we are so far behind everybody else, we can also learn which mistakes we should avoid."&lt;ref name="LA Speech"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g7jcSqNCiDcId7mEJs9DXzmqzGtA?docId=CNG.a49d8e2a5f23889e2d2987feb130e63f.31 Myanmar's Suu Kyi ends US trip, hailing democracy], AFP, 3 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation secured several opinions from the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention that her detention was in violation of international law; engaged in political advocacy such as spearheading a letter from 112 former presidents and Prime Ministers to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urging him to go to Burma to seek her release, which he did six weeks later; and published numerous opeds and spoke widely to the media about her ongoing detention. Its representation of her ended when she was released from house arrest on 13 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110204230501/http://www.freedom-now.org/campaign/aung-san-suu-kyi/ www.freedom-now.org]. www.freedom-now.org.

The '''Black People's Convention''' ('''BPC''') was founded at the end of 1972 as the Nationalist Liberatory Flagship of the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] (BCM) in South Africa. The BCM was a product of three historicultural and ideological imperatives: 

a) Black students were tired of the hypocrisy of white [[Liberalism|liberal]] college/university students of [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]]. The South African Students Organisation (SASO) originated Black Consciousness and Bantu Steve Biko was its founding President in 1969.

b) Blacks were undermining reactionary tribalist/national chauvinist/sexists divide and rule by white racialist settler-colonial governments since 1910 and earlier. 

c) Young people globally were taking their part in the international radical/revolutionary militancy of the mid and late sixties. This tendency was a legacy of the Congress Youth League led by Muziwakhe Lembede, the Unity Movement of South Africa and the Mangaliso Sobukwe-led Pan-Africanist Congress that linked continental and global working class struggle with South Africa's national oppression of Black people.

The BPC was founded by the Black communities from various ethnic and national groups in South Africa, excluding white [[Europe]]ans. The BPC went farther than the [[African National Congress|ANC]]'s civil rights integrationist agenda and agreed with the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] on "National Land" repossession. They went further by espousing scientific [[socialism]] under the guise of "Black Communalism".

When the BPC was gaining ideological [[hegemony]] over the leadership of Blacks in the country, Chief [[Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi]] was given permission by the apartheid government to go to [[London]] and meet the ANC leadership. Later he formed the [[Inkatha Freedom Party|Inkatha]] Cultural Movement, claiming allegiance to Black Consciousness but "not communism or socialism".

[[Steve Biko|Bantu Steve Biko]] was the first among equals in the leadership of the BPC, although he was legally not a member as he was outlawed or banned in March 1973. That restricted him to his home from 6pm till 6am and he was not allowed to belong to any political or social organisation. The BPC was to the [[South African Student Organisation]] ((SASO)) South Africa's Black Consciousness Movement the same role that the [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP) was to [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] and the [[Black Power]] Movement.

The BPC was resurrected in 1978 and was renamed the [[Azanian People's Organisation]] (AZAPO). In exile from 1974 onwards BCM activists and organisers re-built the movement as the [[Black Consciousness Movement of Azania]] (BCMA) and in 1980, became the external wing of AZAPO, with an interim executive leadership committee.

In 1981 the founding National Organiser, [[Mosibudi Mangena]] was nominated to be the Chairperson of the Botswana Region of the BCMA and later by 1983, a motion was moved asking the [[Botswana]] Chapter to invite other external branches to dissolve the BCMA Interim Committee. This was done and Mosibudi Mangena was elected in 1983 Chairperson of the BCMA in exile. Mangena is, since 1996, President AZAPO in [[post-apartheid South Africa]].

The three factors that led to BPC founding its ideology can be found in the indigenous African culture of resistance. The ideology is no further from the [[Convention People's Party]] of [[Ghana]] and the politics not unlike that of the Black Panther Party - hence the Black Peoples Convention.

In the years after the [[Soweto Uprising]] of 1976 black consciousness declined was marginalized as a political force in South Africa, as the ANC demonstrated that it could both opportunistically put a [[Umkhonto we Sizwe|guerilla army]] in the field against apartheid as well as lead a new wave of liberal accommodationist and capitalist collaborationist mass organisations, such as the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]]. Organisations previously associated with black consciousness either were hijacked by political careerist to gravitate towards the ANC's position (e.g. [[AZASO]], Institute of Contextual Theology) or effectively became alternative, although marginalized, core of cadres with consistency like AZAPO 's President Mosibudi who is Minister of Science and Technology in Thabo Mbeki's Cabinet and earlier been Deputy Minister of National Education. Also Azapo as parliamentary representative, Pandelani Nevelofhodwe, MP and former Robben Island prisoner.

The '''National Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (Military Commission)''', '''(NBIS or BIS)''' ({{zh|c=國民政府軍事委員會調查統計局|p=guómín zhèngfǔ jūnshì wěiyuánhuì diàochá tǒngjìjú}}), commonly known as '''Juntong''' ({{zh |s =军统 |t =軍統 |p = Jūntǒng |first = t}}), was the military intelligence agency of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] before 1946. It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.

The NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a "secret police" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.
 
During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.

From a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.

== History ==
=== Early stages ===
The NBIS was founded in 1927 as the "Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]" ({{zh|c=國民革命軍總司令部密查組}})  with the "Special Works Department"({{zh|c=國民政府軍事委員會特務處}}) set up in 1932. When the "Investigation and Statistics Bureau" was established under the Military Commission, the "Special Works Department" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the "Second Division", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Dai sought to make the ''Juntong'' into an extended family with himself as the stern paternal figure, stressing traditional Chinese Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, and righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;Wen-hsin Yeh "Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 pages 546-547&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Juntong'' operated as a traditional sworn brotherhood with all of the senior officers taking an oath making themselves into "brothers".&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547&gt;Wen-hsin Yeh "Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 547&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration for the ''Juntong'' were the secret sworn brotherhoods portrayed in the classics of Chinese literature like ''Water Margin'' and ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.&lt;ref&gt;Wen-hsin Yeh "Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 546&lt;/ref&gt; Dai presented himself as a stern Confucian father figure to the men and women of the ''Juntong'' and liked to quote from book ''The Dynastic History of the Han'' is "Is personal happiness possible before the extermination of the Xiongnu?"&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/&gt; Reflecting this mentality, the men and women serving in the ''Juntong'' were forbidden to marry and expected to be celibate as their only love was to be China.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/&gt; The rules about celibacy were not always followed as Liu Gequing, the ''Juntong'' ace assassin fell in love with and had a relationship with a fellow agent, Lu Ti, during his time in Shanghai.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556&gt;Wen-hsin Yeh "Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance" pages 545–562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 556.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''Juntong'' agents were expected to forsake smoking, gambling and playing mahjong as Dai wanted them to hard work and dedicate their lives totally to China.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/&gt; Reflecting this ethos of absolute dedication to the cause, many of the assassination missions that ''Juntong'' agents were sent on against the Chinese Communists and later on during the war with Japan were known to be suicide missions as the expectation was that ''Juntong'' agents were to value China more than their own lives.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548&gt;Wen-hsin Yeh "Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 548&lt;/ref&gt; Dai often said that the ''Juntong'' were to serve Chiang "like dogs and horses serving their masters without a mind of their own" as Dai presented Chiang as "the Leader" to whom all Chinese had to obey unconditionally.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548/&gt; As the world of espionage was a secretive one, ''Juntong'' agents were advised that they were to be "anonymous heroes" whose deeds would not be remembered by historians.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549&gt;Wen-hsin Yeh "Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 549&lt;/ref&gt;

''Juntong'' agents tended to come from the provincial schools as Dai disliked recruiting those who attended universities, whom the xenophobic, ultra-conservative Dai felt were too exposed to Western influence to fit into the ''Juntong''.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/&gt; ''Juntong'' agents, especially those working as assassins were generally expected to know martial arts before joining, both to improve their skills at killing and because Dai felt the sort of self-discipline needed to master the martial arts was the same sort of dedication that he expected in his agents.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/&gt; Reflecting Dai's traditionalism, the model for the ''Juntong'' were the assassins of the Warring States period and those portrayed in ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/&gt; One of the most best loved books among the ''Juntong'' was the novel ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' (''Legendary Roving Knights of the Rivers and Lakes''), a ''[[wuxia]]'' (martial arts) book that was very popular in Republican China.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/&gt; Dai liked the book so much that he recruited the ''kung fu'' master who was said to be the inspiration for the hero of ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' into the ''Juntong''.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/&gt; The men and women of the ''Juntong'' liked to see themselves as "knights" who would use their skills to defend the weak from the strong and save China from its enemies.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/&gt; A disproportionate number of the men and women of the ''Juntong'' came from the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, all places where Western influence was limited and traditional values flourished.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/&gt;

In 1938, the Special Works Department was expanded and took over the "Investigation and Statistics Bureau" to cope with the increasingly demanding tasks of intelligence operations. [[Dai Li]] was assigned as the ''de facto'' responsibility for running the unit.  Dai's preference for recruiting on the basis of familial loyalties, where one sibling would recruit other siblings to the ''Juntong'' proved to be a weakness, when in 1938 a number of ''Juntong'' agents defected over to work for the "reformed" government of [[Wang Jingwei]], pitting brother literally against brother.&lt;ref&gt;Wen-hsin Yeh "Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 pages 549-550&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sino-Japanese War period ===
During the Sino-Japanese War, NBIS had orchestrated the assassinations of several key Japanese enemy military and government personnel. Between 1937-41, the ''Juntong'', working together with the Green Gang triad, carried out 150 assassinations of Chinese collaborators and 40 Japanese officers in Shanghai alone.&lt;ref name=FJp356&gt;Fenby, Jonathan ''Chiang Kai-Shek China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost'', New York : Carrol &amp; Graf, 2004 page 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552&gt;Wen-hsin Yeh "Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance" pages 545–562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 552.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Juntong'' favored assassinating Chinese collaborators over the Japanese partly because they were easier to kill as the Japanese tended to stick to certain enclaves, but mostly to prevent the Japanese from imposing any sort of ordered government in parts of China they had occupied.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551&gt;Wen-hsin Yeh "Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance" pages 545–562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 551.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan had occupied vast sections of China inhabited by millions of people requiring hundreds of thousands of civil servants to administer while the number of Japanese who were fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese was limited, and to a very large extent the Japanese depended upon Chinese collaborators to administer China for them.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551/&gt; Zhang Xiaolin, a leading member of the Green Gang who went over to the Japanese in 1937 was gunned down by a ''Juntong'' assassin.&lt;ref name=FJp356/&gt; In October 1938, [[Tang Shaoyi]], a former prime minister of the Republic of China who had agreed to serve the Japanese was killed at his home when a ''Juntong'' assassin posing as an antique dealer used the antique axe he was showing to Tang to smash in his head.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550&gt;Wen-hsin Yeh "Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 550&lt;/ref&gt; As the Japanese had no idea of who the ''Juntong'' assassins were, they restored to lashing out by executing at random innocent people who had nothing to do with the assassinations.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/&gt;

On Chinese New Year (18 February 1939), four ''Juntong'' agents assassinated Chen Lu, the foreign minister of the [[Wang Jingwei]] puppet government as he paying respects to his ancestors in his mansion in the French Concession of Shanghai.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/&gt; Led by the ''Juntong'' ace assassin Liu Geqing, he and three others entered Chen's mansion as two of his bodyguards let them in, machine-gunned Chen down as he paying his respects before the family shrine, and then draped over his corpse a scroll reading "Death to Collaborators! Long Live Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek!".&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/&gt; Fu Xiaoan, the banker and shipping tycoon who had long been an enemy of the Kuomintang and had thrown in his lot with the Japanese, becoming the collaborating mayor of Shanghai, was hacked to death with a meat chopper in his bed by his cook who was secretly a ''Juntong'' assassin.&lt;ref name=FJp356/&gt; In 1939, a banquet to celebrate the friendship between Japan and the [[Wang Jingwei]] regime attended by senior Japanese officers and Chinese collaborators in Shanghai were ruined when the cooks, many of whom were working for the ''Juntong'' poisoned the food, and only prompt medical attention that required pumping the stomachs of the guests prevented hundreds of deaths.&lt;ref name=FJp357&gt;Fenby, Jonathan ''Chiang Kai-Shek China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost'', New York : Carrol &amp; Graf, 2004 page 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1939, a train that carrying various Japanese officers and officials of the Wang Jingwei regime from Shanghai to Nanking for a ceremony marking a new treaty that was meant to cement Wang's regime in its place in the "New Order in Asia" was blown up by ''Juntong'' agents, killing 74 and wounding hundreds more.&lt;ref name=FJp357/&gt;

The chief enemy of the ''Juntong'' in Shanghai were not the Japanese, most of whom did not speak Mandarin and even those who did speak Mandarin did so with a Japanese accent that betrayed where they were from, but rather the secret service loyal to the Wang regime that was based in the Huxi "badlands" district in Shanghai headed by [[Ding Mocun]] and Li Shiqun, two former Communists  who defected over to the ''Juntong'' before going over to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=FJp357/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/&gt; The No. 76 organization as it was known after its address at 76 Jessfield Road was founded in February 1939 when Ding and Li presented themselves to General [[Kenji Doihara]], the chief of Japanese intelligence in China, at a restaurant in Shanghai's "Little Tokyo" district, and proclaimed their willingness to serve Japan, stating as former ''Juntong'' agents that they were the only men who could beat the ''Juntong'' at its own game.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/&gt; On 1 March 1939, the No. 76 organization came into being, and its liaison officer was Colonel Haruke Yoshitane of the Plum Blossom Agency, who in turn reported to Colonel Kagesa Sadaaki of the ''[[Kempeitai]]'', the much feared Japanese military police.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/&gt; On 8 May 1939, Wu Shibao, a Green Gang member and the leader of "a gang of local thugs and bullies" agreed to become Li's bodyguard and to provide the "muscle" for the No. 76 organization.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553&gt;Wen-hsin Yeh "Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 553&lt;/ref&gt; Li boosted in a speech "With the left hand we'll annihilate the Blue Shirts, with the right we'll knock down the C.C Clique!".&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/&gt; The No. 76 organization, which moved into its base at No. 76 Jessfield Road in July 1939, was based in a mansion that had once belonged to the warlord General Chen Diaoyuan that was turned into a fortress with concrete blocks on the drive-way and electrified iron gates as both Ding and Li had an obsessive fear of assassination.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/&gt;

As both Ding and Li had been senior ''Juntong'' agents until 1938 with Ding heading the Third Section of the Military Affairs Bureau until late 1938 while Li had been a member of the Green Gang, the two men knew the ''Juntong'' very well and in many ways the No. 76 organization was a mirror image of the ''Juntong''.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/&gt; The collaborating secret police assassinated anti-Japanese Chinese; had powers to arrest without warrant, torture and to kill extrajudicially; kidnapped businessmen for ransom; and were deeply involved in organized crime, charging a "fee" to all of the opium dens, brothels and casinos of Shanghai to allow them to operate.&lt;ref name=FJp357/&gt; In September 1939, Wang Tianmu, the chief ''Juntong'' agent in Shanghai was kidnapped on the Nanjing road by No. 76 agents, was taken to 76 Jessfield Road where he was held for three weeks before being released.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYehp554&gt;Wen-hsin Yeh "Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance" pages 545–562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 554.&lt;/ref&gt; Suspecting Wang, who had not been tortured had been "turned", Dai ordered him assassinated and a ''Juntong'' agent shot him in the shoulder during a failed attempt to kill him.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYehp554/&gt; 

The No. 76 organization blew up the headquarters of the ''Juntong'' in Shanghai while the ''Juntong'' assassins killed a dozen of No. 76 organization leaders in the fall of 1939.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555&gt;Wen-hsin Yeh "Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance" pages 545–562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 555.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang's defection to the No. 76 organization proved a most serious blow as he betrayed all of the agents under his command, and the ''Kempeitai'' arrested dozens of ''Juntong agents'' in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin due to the information provided by Wang.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/&gt; On 15 November 1939, Zhao Gangyi, the ''Juntong'' chief in Qingdao, fearing it was only a matter of time before the ''Kempeitai'' arrested him owning to the information provided by Wang, decided to save himself and defected over to the Wang regime,  betraying all of the agents under his command to the ''Kempeitai''.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/&gt; On 24 November 1939, thanks to information provided by Zhao, the ''Kempeitai'' raided the ''Juntong'''s headquarters in Beijing.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/&gt; 

On 21 December 1939, Ding was almost killed when his mistress, the teenage schoolgirl Zheng Pingru, led him into a ''Juntong'' assassination attempt.&lt;ref name=WFp194&gt;Wakeman, Frederic ''The Shanghai Badlands: Wartime Terrorism and Urban Crime, 1937-1941'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002 page 194.&lt;/ref&gt; When Ding ordered his men to execute Zheng, a girl born to a Chinese father and a Japanese mother, she asked them not to shoot her in the face, so she would still be beautiful at her funeral, a request that No. 76 execution squad honored.&lt;ref name=WFp194/&gt; This incident is generally believed to have been the inspiration for the 1979 novella [[Lust, Caution (novella)|''Lust, Caution'']] by [[Eileen Chang]], which in turn inspired the 2007 film ''[[Lust, Caution]]''. On Christmas Eve 1939, Chen Mingchu, a former ''Juntong'' agent who had joined the No. 76 organization was assassinated by the ''Juntong'' agents at the Huierdeng nightclub in Shanghai.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/&gt; Chen and his twenty bodyguards were celebrating Christmas on the floor of the nightclub when a group of ''Juntong'' agents armed with machine-guns burst in to gun down Chen and his bodyguards.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/&gt; On 8 September 1940, Zhou Guangshi, the chief of ''Juntong'' operations in occupied China was captured by the ''Kempeital'' who tortured and executed him.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/&gt; By late 1941, most of the ''Juntong'' agents operating in the major cities occupied by Japan were either killed or captured.&lt;ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/&gt;

Various "guerrilla command" and "traffic police" groups under the NBIS carried out a wide range of covert espionage and counterintelligence activities against the Japanese and Japanese collaborators. In 1942, the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization]] was founded, which led to 3, 000 Americans being sent to China for joint operations with the ''Juntong''.&lt;ref&gt;Pomar, Norman &amp; Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Dai's relations with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) were unfriendly and at one point Dai warned William "Wild Bill" Donovan, the chief of the OSS: "If the OSS tries to operate outside of SACO, I will kill your agents".&lt;ref&gt;Pomar, Norman &amp; Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 pages 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Juntong'' co-operated with the OSS in parachuting agents, mostly Chinese-Americans, behind Japanese lines, but relations were stained in 1943 when the OSS sent [[Ilya Andreyevich Tolstoy]] to Tibet to contact the Dali Lama as China's government did not recognize Tibet's ''de facto'' independence.&lt;ref name=PNATp112&gt;Pomar, Norman &amp; Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 112.&lt;/ref&gt; China which regarded Tibet, which had become ''de facto'' independent in 1911, as a breakaway province that was still legally part of China, greatly resented the Tolstoy mission as a tacit American recognition of Tibetan independence.&lt;ref name=PNATp112/&gt; From 1937-41, more than 18,000 NBIS intelligence agents lost their lives, and by the end of the war the number has increased to more than 45,000.

=== Chinese Civil War period ===
In August 1946, the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]]  was established to replace the Military Commission, and the NBIS changed its name to the Counterintelligence Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense ({{zh|c=國防部保密局}}). [[Mao Renfeng]] was the director given the de facto responsibility for running the unit.

=== After 1949 in mainland China ===
After Nationalist government was moved to Taiwan in 1949, a number of BIS staff remained in mainland China for intelligence activities. The NBIS operatives were severely repressed by Chinese Communist government during the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], and were mostly executed by firing squad or received heavy punishment. By end of the 1950s, the NBIS staff were largely shot or serving hard labor on the mainland.

=== In Taiwan ===
In 1955, the Bureau was again reorganized as the Intelligence Bureau ({{zh|c=國防部情報局}}), responsible for early-warning intelligence collection and strategic analysis. Since then, the [[Ministry of Justice]] took over the functions of counterintelligence and investigation from the Bureau.

On 1 July 1985, the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' ({{zh|c=國防部軍事情報局}}) was created by merging the Special Military Intelligence Office with the Intelligence Bureau. The Military Intelligence Bureau was subordinated to the  [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] under the direct command of the Chief of the [[Staff (military)|General Staff]].

The '''Canadian Jewish Congress''' ({{Lang-fr|Congrès juif canadien}}, {{Lang-yi|קאַנאַדער ײִדישער קאָנגרעס}}, {{Lang-he|הקונגרס היהודי הקנדי}}) was, for more than ninety years, the main [[advocacy group]] for the [[Jewish community in Canada]]. Regarded by many as the "Parliament of Canadian Jewry," the Congress was at the forefront of the struggle for [[Human rights in Canada|human rights]], [[Social equality|equality]], [[Immigration to Canada|immigration reform]] and [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founding of the Canadian Jewish Congress National Historic Event|website=Directory of Federal Heritage Designations|publisher=[[Government of Canada]]|access-date=14 November 2018|url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=10931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization disbanded in July 2011 following a reorganization of the [[Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs]], of which the CJA became a subsidiary in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjc.ca/2011/06/30/12198/|title=Canadian Jewish Congress is discontinuing its activities|website=Canadian Jewish Congress|date=30 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720045227/http://www.cjc.ca/|archive-date=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Founding and early history===
[[File:1943–44 Jewish calendar for the Canadian Armed Forces.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Jewish calendar]] for the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] in World War II, published by the Canadian Jewish Congress]]
The immediate predecessor to the CJC was formed in 1915 by the Montreal chapter of [[Poalei Zion]], a [[working class]] [[Labor Zionism|Labour Zionist]] organization. They were soon joined by thirteen other organizations, mostly other chapters of Poalei Zion and the [[Workmen's Circle|Arbeiter Ring]], in forming the Canadian Jewish Alliance. The organization, composed of elected officials, set out to represent all of Canadian Jewry on its major political, national and international affairs. It also aimed to respond to problems arising from the [[First World War]], specifically the [[Antisemitism in Europe|oppression of Jews]] overseas, the immigration of [[Expulsions and exoduses of Jews|Jewish refugees]], and Britain's [[Balfour declaration|promises]] to create a [[Jewish state]].&lt;ref name=juifsdici&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Jewish Congress|website=Juifs d'ici|url=http://www.juifsdici.ca/en/canadian-jewish-congress/|year=2017|access-date=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=discredit&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Discredit: Anti-Semitism, Social Credit, and the Jewish Response|first=Janine|last=Stingel|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=2000||url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt809xh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, over 25,000 Jews from across Canada voted for delegates to the first convention of the CJC held in [[Montreal]] that March. Diverse groups including the [[Zionist Organization of Canada|Canadian Federation of Zionist Societies]], [[Poalei Zion]], [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]], and the [[Arbeiter Ring]] were present at the convention. While there, they were addressed by the [[Canadian Solicitor General|Solicitor General of Canada]], and were entertained at [[Montreal City Hall]], where a large [[Zionism|Zionist]] flag was draped over the Mayor's chair. The main decision at that meeting was the founding of the Jewish Immigrant Aid Society to assist Jewish settlers and refugees in Canada. They also passed motions expressing the Jewish community's loyalty to Canada and others declaring their support for the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]]. The convention elected [[Lyon Cohen]], former President of the Montreal Clothing Manufacturers Union, as their President.

Despite this auspicious start, the CJC fell into abeyance and was inactive until 1934, due to lack of leadership and funding.{{r|discredit}} With the rise in [[anti-Semitism]] and restricted immigration policies in the 1930s, the CJC re-convened in 1934 and held the Congress' second plenum in [[Toronto]] in January. Cohen's friend and close colleague, [[Samuel William Jacobs]], a prominent Jewish leader and [[Member of Parliament]], became the revived Congress' first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shuchat|first=Wilfred|author-link=Wilfred Shuchat|year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWuH05fuO9wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=Jacobs%20Congress&amp;f=false|title=The Gate of Heaven: The Story of Congregation Shaar Hashomayim of Montreal|page=114|publisher=McGill-Queens University Press|isbn=0773520899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the Canadian Jewish Congress partnered with [[B'nai Brith Canada]] to create the Joint Public Relations Committee, with the goal of developing a strategy to combat discrimination and find allies within other [[minority group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=James W. S.

===Post–World War II===
[[File:News. Canadian Jewish Congress - Meeting at His Majesty's Theatre BAnQ P48S1P13832.jpg|right|230px|thumb|Meeting of the Canadian Jewish Congress in 1946]]
The CJC was active before and during [[World War II]] in lobbying the government (with limited success) to open the borders to Jewish refugees fleeing Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Goldberg|first=Adara|title=Canada and the Holocaust| encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Historica Canada|date=6 May 2016|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/holocaust|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, over 1,100 [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|child Holocaust survivors]] immigrated to Canada in the War Orphans Project, a refugee resettlement program administered by the CJC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Fraiman|date=28 March 2018|url=http://www.cjnews.com/perspectives/features/the-story-of-1123-orphans-who-came-to-canada-after-the-holocaust|title=A fresh start: The story of Canada's postwar Jewish orphans|newspaper=[[The Canadian Jewish News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CJC also organized relief aid for [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors who were being detained in [[Displaced Person]]s camps. Along with the efforts of Senator [[Arthur Roebuck]] and Rabbi [[Avraham Aharon Price]], the CJC helped obtain the release of young, Jewish refugees from internment camps, bringing them to study in Toronto.

The Congress' dominant figure from 1939 to 1962 was its president, [[Samuel Bronfman]] who was elected president following Jacobs' death in 1938. During the [[Cold War]] at Bronfman's urging, the CJC expelled the [[United Jewish People's Order]] and other [[Jewish Bolshevism|communist Jewish]] organizations in 1951. At the time, the UJPO was one of the largest Jewish fraternal organizations in Canada. It would not be readmitted to the CJC until 1995.&lt;ref name = "Ester2"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Ester|last1=Reiter|first2=Roz|last2=Usiskin|url=http://www.vcn.bc.ca/outlook/library/articles/jewsontheleft/p05Forum1.htm|title=Jewish Dissent in Canada: The United Jewish People's Order|conference=Forum on Jewish Dissent|publisher=Association of Canadian Jewish Studies|location=Winnipeg|date=30 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the CJC gifted approximately 7,000 volumes of rare [[Judaica]] to the [[Library and Archives Canada|National Library]] on behalf of the Canadian Jewish community in honour of the [[Canadian Centennial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thediscoverblog.com/tag/canadian-jewish-congress/|website=Library and Archives Canada Blog|title=From the Lowy Room: commemorating a centennial gift|date=19 September 2017|first=Michael|last=Kent|publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1982 Lebanon War|war between Israel and Lebanon]] in 1982, former Prime Minister [[Joe Clark]] issued a public rebuke to the CJC at its annual policy convention for its stance of unconditionally supporting the State of [[Israel]] in that war. During the speech, Clark was interrupted with heckles from the crowd and approximately 50 people left the room in protest. Near the end of his remarks, the audience began to sing ''[[Hatikvah]]'', the Israeli national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Domestic_Battleground.html?id=O4ZFvl2gkZcC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Domestic Battleground: Canada and the Arab-Israeli Conflict|editor1-first=David|editor1-last=Taras|editor2-first=David|editor2-last=Goldberg|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the initiatives sponsored by the CJC was the International Jewish Correspondence, founded in 1978, whose goal was to link Jews around the world as [[pen-pal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Struthers|first=Gord|date=13 September 1986|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O0VgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=znANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1087,3384572&amp;dq=barry+simon+pen+pals&amp;hl=en|title=Pen-pal service connects thousands around world|newspaper=[[Star-Phoenix]]|access-date=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of the internet in the 1990s, IJC became less active and had folded by 2002. The organization also provided addresses for Jews living in Arab and Soviet Bloc countries as well as Jewish prisoners who were put in contact with others in the same situation. Jewish people from nearly 20 countries participated in the initiative, including those with declining Jewish populations such as [[Estonia]], [[Morocco]] and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=James|date=9 January 1987|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-01-09/features/8701020647_1_pen-pals-american-jewish-congress-simon|title=Canadian Teacher Brings Jewish Pen Pals Together|newspaper=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite archive|publisher=The Canadian Jewish Heritage Network|collection-url=http://www.cjhn.ca/permalink/86|collection=International Jewish Correspondence|institution=Canadian Jewish Congress Charities Committee National Archives|fonds=I0084|access-date=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later history and disbandment===
In its later decades the CJC launched campaigns to pressure the [[Soviet Union]] to allow [[Refusenik|Jewish emigration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jewishtoronto.com/wendyspeech|date=May 2015|first=Wendy R.|last=Eisen|title=Canadian Soviet Jewry Movement|website=UJA Federation of Greater Toronto|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to pressure the Canadian government to prosecute [[Nazism|Nazi]] war criminals who had settled in Canada, and to enact and use [[hate crime]]s legislation against anti-Semites and [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] such as [[Ernst Zündel]]. The CJC was actively opposed to [[Quebec separatism]] in the 1990s, and formed a national coalition of Canada's [[Italian Canadians|Italian]], [[Greek Canadians|Greek]] and [[History of the Jews in Canada|Jewish]] communities during the debate on the [[Charlottetown Accord]].&lt;ref name=globeandmail&gt;{{cite news|last=Sallot|first=Jeff|title=New president wants CJC to be more active: Winner of bitter leadership race is convinced fences will be mended soon|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=17 May 1995|url=https://search-proquest-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/docview/1143983045|issn=03190714|page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CJC to maintain role in boosting Canadian unity|date=15 February 1996|newspaper=[[The Canadian Jewish News]]|url=https://search-proquest-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/docview/351423336|page=22|issn=00083941|language=en|volume=36|issue=41|location=Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CJC also worked to promote tolerance and understanding between religious and ethnic groups, promote anti-racist work and other campaigns.

The CJC introduced significant changes to its internal organization in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishindependent.ca/archives/June07/archives07June22-01.html|first=Freeman|last=Poritz|title=Plenary brings change|newspaper=Jewish Independent|date=22 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The previous system of electing representatives to the Board of Directors was discarded, and a new system was introduced wherein Board members were chosen by indirect elections from "regional Congress representatives" and "delegates from Jewish federations".  Congress CEO [[Bernie Farber]] supported the change, arguing that it would streamline a complicated process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Lungen|title=Congress prepares to elect new president|newspaper=[[The Canadian Jewish News]]|date=16 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others argued that the new system would give disproportionate power to the [[Canadian Council for Israel and Jewish Advocacy]].  One individual, described by ''[[The Canadian Jewish News]]'' as a "close observer of Congress", argued that CIJA was "stacking the deck" in a bid to take over the CJC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Lungen|title=Congress headed for joint presidency|newspaper=[[The Canadian Jewish News]]|date=21 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the renamed [[Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs]] (CIJA) assumed the functions of the CJC after an 18-month restructuring process in which the functions of the Canadian Jewish Congress, the Canada-Israel Committee, the Quebec-Israel Committee, National Jewish Campus Life and the University Outreach Committee were consolidated, a move that left the Jewish community divided.&lt;ref name=restructure&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada's restructured Jewish advocacy agency gets name|url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/08/23/3089089/canadas-restructured-jewish-advocacy-agency-gets-name|accessdate=23 August 2011|newspaper=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Canadian Jewish Congress has been replaced by the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs|first=Kenneth|last=Kidd|date=30 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]]|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/08/30/the_canadian_jewish_congress_has_been_replaced_by_the_centre_for_israel_and_jewish_affairs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 2011 the CJC posted a message on its website declaring that it had halted its activities and that its functions would be assumed by CIJA.&lt;ref name=levy&gt;{{cite news|last=Levy-Ajzenkopf|first=Andy|title=Congress era over as CIJA reboot start|url=http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21927&amp;Itemid=86|accessdate=24 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Canadian Jewish News]]|date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19793">The '''ceasefire attempts during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict''' started immediately, with [[Lebanon]] calling for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire already the day after the start of the hostilities. [[Israel]], however, strongly backed by the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], insisted that there could be no ceasefire until Hezbollah's militia had been disarmed or removed from southern Lebanon.  The [[United Nations Security Council]] held meetings throughout the conflict but failed to agree on a ceasefire resolution.

==Day-by-day account of the ceasefire attempts==

===13 July===
The Lebanese Prime Minister [[Fouad Siniora]] stated that his government had not been aware of Hezbollah's raid before it happened "and does not take responsibility for, nor endorses what happened on the international border", and Lebanon urged the [[United Nations]] to take an immediate decision to stop the firing and lift the Israeli sea and air blockade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Siniora’s Cabinet makes clear it had nothing to do with ‘what happened’|date=2006-07-13|publisher=[[Daily Star (Lebanon)]]|url=http://dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=73930|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714183432/http://dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=73930|archivedate=2006-07-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Headlines for July 14, 2006|date=2006-07-14|publisher=[[Democracy Now!]]|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/07/14/146251&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811170101/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F07%2F14%2F146251&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=25|archivedate=August 11, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, the United States vetoed a draft resolution before the [[Security Council]] calling for a ceasefire and release of all hostages in relating the Gaza conflict, citing the "fluid and volatile nature of events on the ground" which rendered it outmoded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undemocracy.com/securitycouncil/meeting_5488|title=Security Council Meeting 5488|date=13 July 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702182624/http://www.undemocracy.com/securitycouncil/meeting_5488|archivedate=2 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC News reported that Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] would agree to a ceasefire only if Hezbollah returned the two captured soldiers, stopped firing rockets at Israel, and if Lebanon implemented [[UN Security Council Resolution 1559]], which calls for the group’s disarmament.&lt;ref name="BBCNews"&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel hits Hezbollah leader’s HQ|date=2006-07-14|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5179862.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Security Council]] met to consider the situation.

U.S. President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] stated that, "We of course are continuing discussions with Israel, all sovereign nations have a right to defend themselves from terrorist attacks. Our message (to Israel) is defend yourself, but be mindful of the consequences, so we are urging restraint."&lt;br&gt;On the same day, [[United Nations Security Council]] rejected pleas from Lebanon that it call for an immediate ceasefire, the U.S. reportedly being the only member of the 15-nation Council to oppose any action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Headlines for July 17, 2006 |date=2006-07-17 |publisher=[[Democracy Now!]] |url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/07/17/1423239 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060802090436/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F07%2F17%2F1423239 |archivedate=2006-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign ministers from the United States, Europe and the Middle East meeting in [[Rome]] vowed "to work immediately to reach with the utmost urgency a ceasefire that puts an end to the current violence and hostilities," though the U.S. maintained strong support for the Israeli campaign and the conference's results were reported to have fallen short of Arab and European leaders' expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rome talks yield no plan to end Lebanon fighting |date=2006-07-26 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-07-26T185440Z_01_L26848349_RTRUKOC_0_US-MIDEAST-MEETING.xml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710034338/http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=topNews |archivedate=2006-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Rome meeting, Lebanon's Prime Minister Fuad Siniora presented the 7-point [[Siniora Plan]], which called for a mutual release of Lebanese and Israeli prisoners and detainees, a withdrawal of the Israeli ground troops behind the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Blue Line]], that the disputed [[Shebaa Farms]] area is placed under UN jurisdiction until the ownership issue has been settled, that the Lebanese army full takes control over southern Lebanon, and that a strong multi-national force with a UN mandate is placed in southern Lebanon and given the necessary powers to guarantee stability and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One way out: the Siniora plan|publisher=[[Daily Star (Lebanon)]]|date=2006-08-02|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=5&amp;article_id=74418}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan received the support of Hezbollah, the [[European Union|EU]] and the [[Arab League]], including countries such as [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EU backs Lebanon PM's truce plan|publisher=EU Business|date=2006-07-28|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/afp/060728160709.kyqd7ixg|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181706/http://www.eubusiness.com/afp/060728160709.kyqd7ixg|archivedate=2007-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EU enlists Syrian help with Lebanon crisis| publisher=[[Ynetnews]]|date=2006-08-04|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3286074,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=King Affirms Support of Plan to Defuse Lebanese Crisis|publisher=[[Petra (Agency)|Petra]]|date=2006-08-05|url=http://www.petra.gov.jo/nepras/2006/Aug/05/12000.htm}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the bombing raid on [[2006 Qana airstrike|Qana]], the Israeli government announced a 48-hour limited suspension of air operations over southern Lebanon. The reason given was to allow the UN to coordinate "humanitarian efforts on the ground in southern Lebanon, to allow the IDF time to investigate events at Qana, and, according to an Israeli Army spokesman, to "allow a 24-hour period of safe passage for all residents of south Lebanon who wish to leave". The IDF reserved the right to attack targets that threatened its forces during the pause.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news | title = Israel halts attacks for 48 hours| date=2006-07-30| publisher=[[CNN]]|url= http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/30/mideast.main/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite news | title = Israel suspends air raids Death of 50 in strike prompts 48-hour break; Rice rebuffed| date=2006-07-31| publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0607310188jul31,1,3817146.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news | title = Deadly Israeli Attack Escalates Conflict| date=2006-07-30| work=[[The New York Times]]|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/world/middleeast/30cnd-mideast.html | first1=Steven | last1=Erlanger | first2=Hassan M. | last2=Fattah | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===4 August===
[[France]] and the [[United States]] presented a draft UN Security Council [[United Nations resolution|resolution]]. It was, however, regarded as much too favourable to Israel by Lebanon and most Arab nations, as it didn't call for an immediate Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory, and only called on Israel to stop its offensive activities, while calling for Hezbollah to stop all activities.

===7 August===
At an emergency meeting of the [[Arab League]] in [[Beirut]], the Siniora Plan was further detailed, by specifying that 15,000 Lebanese Army troops would fill the void in southern Lebanon between an Israeli withdrawal and the arrival of the international force. The number of soldiers corresponded with what Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] earlier had said that the size of the international force would need to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanon ready to send 15,000 troops to south when Israel pulls out|publisher=TurkishPress.com|date=2006-08-07|url=http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=136698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olmert: 15,000 int'l troops needed|publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=2006-08-03|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1154525796501&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708035818/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1154525796501&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===8 August===
A delegation from the [[Arab League]] came to New York to try to persuade the architects of the UN draft, France and USA, to base it on the Siniora Plan. This, combined with a strong opposition to the existing draft from several of the 15 Council members, especially [[Qatar]], resulted in a change of France's position. In order to avoid a total collapse of the UN efforts to end the hostilities, this eventually led to a substantial revision of the draft proposal (with several re-drafts in between), which included many elements from the Siniora Plan.

The [[Security Council]] met and discussed the merits of a draft resolution which was before them (although not publicly available).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undemocracy.com/securitycouncil/meeting_5508|title=Security Council Meeting 5508|date=8 August 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234151/http://www.undemocracy.com/securitycouncil/meeting_5508|archivedate=26 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===11 August===
The Security Council unanimously adopted a revised draft of the resolution as [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701]] in a meeting attended by the Secretaries of State or Foreign Ministers of [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Qatar]], [[Greece]], and [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undemocracy.com/securitycouncil/meeting_5511|title=Security Council Meeting 5511|date=11 August 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234207/http://www.undemocracy.com/securitycouncil/meeting_5511|archivedate=26 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chilean expansionism''' refers to the [[foreign policy]] of [[Chile]] to [[expansionism|expand its territorial control]] over key strategic locations and economic resources as a means to ensure its [[national security]] and assert its geopolitical [[Power (international relations)|power]] in [[South America]].{{efn-ua|According to political scientist Marcus J. Kurtz: "It was the construction of an elite consensus in Chile around the desirability of initiating wars of conquest — from which the dominant classes expected to benefit — that turned military conflict into a component of the process by which an effective administration was constructed. Successive conflicts — with the Araucanian Indians to the south, with Spain, and repeatedly with Peru and Bolivia — were both initiated by the Chilean state and used to justify the expansion of public powers, the creation of an effective standing army, and the imposition of substantial new tax burdens, and the creation of major public infrastructure."{{sfn|Kurtz|2013|pp=89-90}}}} Chile's significant territorial acquisitions, which occurred mostly throughout the 19th century, paved the way for its [[Emerging power|emergence]] as one of the [[ABC countries|three most powerful and wealthiest]] states in South America during the 20th century.

After achieving its [[Chilean War of Independence|independence from Spain in 1818]], Chile held control of territory spanning roughly the same boundaries of the colonial [[General Captaincy of Chile|general captaincy]] that was under the control of the [[Spanish Empire]]'s [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Under the ''[[uti possidetis iuris]]'' principle that delimited the international boundaries of the independent South American states, Chile bordered at its north with [[Bolivia]] in the [[Atacama Desert]] and at its east with [[Argentina]]. To the south Chile claimed all lands west of the Andes but controlled only the area down to [[Bío Bío River]] plus the area between [[Valdivia]] and [[Chiloé Archipelago|Chiloé]], with the rest either belonging to independent [[Mapuche]] of [[Araucanía (historic region)|Araucanía]] or being sparsely populated by other tribes. The ''uti possidetis'' system proved ephemeral, nonetheless; the lack of formal border treaties caused disputes throughout the continent.

This period of uncertainty presented both challenges and opportunities for Chile, with regional instability creating a precarious state of diplomatic affairs but also allowing the growth of Chilean power ambitions. The Chilean national [[elite]] sought to ensure that the country's territorial limits and the regional [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] would favor their economic and political aspirations. Thus, the country increased its military power, especially its [[Command of the sea|naval presence]], to pursue a policy of intimidation and force.{{sfn|Rauch|1999|pp=186}}

To its north, Chile imposed its dominance by eliminating the threat posed by the union of [[Bolivia]] with [[Peru]] during the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836-1839), followed by the conquest of these countries' mineral-rich territories in the Atacama during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879-1884)—in the process leaving Bolivia [[landlocked]] and [[Occupation of Lima|pillaging the Peruvian capital]]. To its south and east, Chile used military force and [[Settler colonialism|colonization]] to [[Occupation of Araucanía|occupy Araucanía]] (1861-1883) and successfully [[Argentine–Chilean boundary dispute|dispute Argentine claims]] over westernmost [[Patagonia]] and the [[Strait of Magellan]]—the outbreak of war only narrowly avoided in multiple occasions. Chile's expansionist drive practically culminated with [[Easter Island]]'s annexation in 1888, but vestiges of it continued well into the 20th century—''e.g.'', the country's [[Chilean Antarctic Territory|claim over Antarctic territory]] in 1940.

Although Chile did not fulfill all of its territorial ambitions, its relative success attracted the attention of the Western Hemisphere's other major [[Manifest Destiny|expansionist polity]], the [[United States]], and cemented Chile's status as a [[regional power]] in [[Latin America]]. Chile's territorial expansion also left a legacy of distrust with its neighbors, all of which continue having boundary disputes with Chile. The country's mistreatment of the non-Chilean inhabitants of its conquered territories, particularly the state-sponsored forced [[cultural assimilation]] process of "Chilenization", have further led to internal tensions and calls for greater autonomy, if not independence, from the [[Mapuche conflict|Mapuche]] and the [[Rapa Nui people|Rapa Nui]].&lt;ref name="EGAÑA, R.

== Origins ==
[[File:DPortales.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Portrait of a man|upright=.75|Chilean statesman Diego Portales was the lead proponent of his country's aggressive foreign policy]]

The newly-independent [[Republic of Chile]]'s territorial possessions, inherited from the colonial general captaincy (''capitanía general'') that was under the control of the [[Spanish Empire]]'s [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], had left the state surrounded by undefined boundaries. Its northernmost settlement was [[Copiapó]] in the southern [[Atacama Desert]], bordering [[Bolivia]]; however, its exact boundary was [[Atacama border dispute|disputed]] until 1866, when both countries [[Boundary Treaty of 1866 between Chile and Bolivia|delimited their boundaries]] at the 24° South parallel from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Its southernmost settlement was [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]], a few kilometers north of the [[La Frontera, Chile|frontier]] fortifications between Chile and the [[Araucanía (historic region)|Araucanía]], the territory that the [[Mapuche]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] had successfully retained after defeating Spain in the [[Arauco War]].

== History ==
=== Conquest of the Atacama ===
[[File:Cambate Naval de Angamos.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Two ironclad ships fighting|Chile's [[Battle of Angamos|capture]] of Peru's warship ''[[Huáscar (ironclad)|Huáscar]]'', in 1879, further assured its naval supremacy and victory in the war.]]

To its north, Chile imposed its dominance by eliminating the threat posed by the union of [[Bolivia]] with [[Peru]] during the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836-1839), followed by the conquest of these countries' mineral-rich territories in the Atacama during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879-1884)—in the process leaving Bolivia [[landlocked]] and [[Occupation of Lima|sacking the Peruvian capital]]. 

Chile slowly started to expand its influence and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of Chiloé was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of silver ore in Chañarcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valparaíso, which led to conflict over maritime supremacy in the Pacific with Peru. 

The [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] confirmed Chilean sovereignty over the Strait of Magellan. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with Peru and Bolivia (1879–83), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable [[Caliche (mineral)#Chilean caliche|nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence. Chile had joined the stand as one of the high-income countries in South America by 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=137|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occupation of Araucanía ===
[[File:Acción de Quecherehuas 1868.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Painting of infantry about to face a cavalry charge|Chile's occupation of Araucanía was fiercely resisted by the Mapuche, who resorted to [[Malón|cavalry raids]] for defence]]
{{main|Occupation of Araucanía}}

To its south and east, Chile used military force and [[Settler colonialism|colonization]] to [[Occupation of Araucanía|occupy Araucanía]] (1861-1883) and successfully [[Argentine–Chilean boundary dispute|dispute Argentine claims]] over westernmost [[Patagonia]] and the [[Strait of Magellan]]—the outbreak of war only narrowly avoided in multiple occasions.

=== Colonization of Patagonia ===
At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern Chile intensifying [[Occupation of Araucanía|penetration into Araucanía]] and [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|colonizing Llanquihue with German immigrants]] in 1848. Through the founding of [[Fort Bulnes]] by the [[Schooner Ancud]] under the command of [[John Williams Wilson]], the Magallanes region joined the country in 1843, while the Antofagasta area, at the time part of, Bolivia, began to fill with people.

=== Annexation of Easter Island ===

[[File:Vicuña Mackenna por Lemoine.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Portrait of a man|upright=.75|Chilean statesman Vicuña Mackenna was a major advocate of Chilean expansionism into Polynesia]]

Chile's interest in expanding into the [[Pacific Islands|islands of the Pacific Ocean]] dates to the presidency of [[José Joaquín Prieto]] (1831-1841) and the ideology of Diego Portales, who considered that Chile's expansion into Polynesia was a natural consequence of its maritime destiny.{{sfn|Barros|1970|p=497}}{{efn-ua|According to economist Neantro Saavedra-Rivano: "Of all Latin American countries, Chile has been the most explicit and consistent throughout its history in expressing its vocation as a Pacific nation and acting in accordance with this conception."{{sfn|Saavedra-Rivano|1993|p=193}}}} The first stage of the country's expansionism into the Pacific began a decade later, in 1851, when—in response to an American incursion into the [[Juan Fernández Islands]]—Chile's government formally organized the islands into a subdelegation of [[Valparaíso]].{{sfn|Barros|1970|pp=213-214}} That same year, Chile's [[Merchant navy|merchant fleet]] briefly succeeded in creating an agricultural goods exchange market that connected the [[California|Californian]] port of [[San Francisco]] with [[Australia]], renewing Chile's economic interest in the Pacific.{{sfn|Barros|1970|p=213}} By 1861, Chile had established a lucrative enterprise across the Pacific, its [[Chilean peso|national currency]] abundantly circulating throughout Polynesia and its merchants trading in the markets of [[Tahiti]], [[New Zealand]], [[Tasmania]], [[Shanghai]]; negotiations were also made with the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines|Spanish Philippines]], and altercations reportedly occurred between Chilean and American whalers in the [[Sea of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{harvnb|Barros|1970|p=214}}
* {{harvnb|Saavedra-Rivano|1993|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period ended as a result of the [[Bombardment of Valparaíso|Chilean merchant fleet's destruction]] by Spanish forces in 1866, during the [[Chincha Islands War]].{{sfn|Barros|1970|p=214}}

Chile's Polynesian aspirations would again be awakened in the aftermath of the country's decisive victory against Peru in the War of the Pacific, which left the Chilean fleet as the dominant maritime force in the Pacific coast of the Americas.{{sfn|Barros|1970|p=497}} Valparaíso had also become the most important port in the Pacific coast of South America, providing Chilean merchants with the capacity to find markets in the Pacific for its new mineral wealth acquired from the Atacama.{{sfn|Delsing|2012|p=56}} During this period, the Chilean intellectual and politician [[Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna]] (who served as senator in the [[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]] from 1876 to 1885) was an influential voice in favor of Chilean expansionism into the Pacific—he considered that Spain's discoveries in the Pacific had been stolen by the British, and envisioned that Chile's duty was to create an empire in the Pacific that would reach [[Asia]].{{sfn|Barros|1970|p=497}} In the context of this imperialist fervor is that, in 1886, Captain [[Policarpo Toro]] of the [[Chilean Navy]] proposed to his superiors the annexation of [[Easter Island]]; a proposal that attained support from President [[José Manuel Balmaceda]] because of the island's apparent strategic location and economic value. After Toro transferred the rights to the island's sheep ranching operations from Tahiti-based businesses to the Chilean-based [[Williamson-Balfour Company]] in 1887, Easter Island's annexation process was culminated with the signing of the "Agreement of Wills" between Rapa Nui chieftains and Toro, in name of the Chilean government, in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;See:

== Consequences ==
In 1978, amid [[Direct negotiations between Chile and Argentina in 1977–78|direct negotiations]] attempting to settle the [[Beagle conflict]], Chilean President [[Augusto Pinochet]] assured that Chile had no expansionist intentions, but that his government would "defend the patrimony that belongs to it by right."{{sfn|Lagos Carmona|1980|p=339}}

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Chile temporarily resolved its border disputes with Argentina with the [[Puna de Atacama Lawsuit]] of 1899 and the [[Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case 1902 (Argentina, Chile)|Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case, 1902]].

Chile's rise as a major geopolitical power in the South Pacific also had the consequence of placing it in direct confrontation with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;See:

== Criticism ==
[[File:General Pinochet junto a una pascuense.jpg|thumb|right|200px|General Pinochet posing with a native [[Rapa Nui people|Rapa Nui]] woman]]
According to Chilean diplomat [[Juan Salazar Sparks]], the political theories of [[Andrés Bello]] and Diego Portales were neither expansionist nor [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]]; rather, he argues, they believed that Chile's status as a [[maritime nation]] and its role as a promoter of [[Pan-Americanism]] rested on its moral leadership, [[Cultural imperialism|cultural influence]], and success in maintaining the regional balance of power.{{sfn|Salazar Sparks|1999|p=173}} Moreover, he considers that Chile was forced into wars with Peru and Bolivia in order to protect the regional balance of power, and that the country's participation in the [[Chincha Islands War]] is evidence of its commitment to Pan-Americanism.{{sfn|Salazar Sparks|1999|p=173}} Chilean researcher Felipe Sanfuentes also argues that Chile was not an expansionist country and considers that this perspective is promoted by Argentine [[irrendentism]] over [[Tierra del Fuego]] and [[Patagonia]].{{sfn|Sanfuentes|1992|p=68}}

A '''confessional state''' is a state which officially practices a particular [[religion]], and at least encourages its citizens to do likewise.

Over human history, many [[State (polity)|states]] have been confessional states. This is especially true in countries where [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Buddhism]] were the religions of the state. The idea of [[religious pluralism]] in modern terms is relatively recent, and until the beginning of the 20th century, many if not most nations had [[state religion]]s enshrined in their respective [[constitution]]s or by decree of the [[monarch]], even if other religions were permitted to practice.

However, there are many examples of large multicultural empires that have existed throughout time where the religion of the state was not imposed on subjected regions. For instance, the [[Mongol Empire]], where [[Tengrism]] was the religion of the court, but not imposed on those ruled by the Mongols, the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and the [[Roman Empire]] before [[Constantine I]], where regional [[clergies]] and practices were allowed to dominate as long as offerings were made to Roman Gods and tribute paid to Rome.

[[Religious minorities]] are accorded differing degrees of tolerance under confessional states; adherents may or may not have a set of legal rights, and these rights may not be accessible in practice. For example, in [[Middle ages|medieval]] [[Europe]] [[Jewish people]] suffered various degrees of official and unofficial discrimination; during the same period in [[Islam]]ic states, non-Muslims or [[dhimmi]] were legally inferior to Muslims but accorded certain protections.

In Europe, the 1648 [[Treaty of Westphalia]] institutionalized the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''—that rulers of a state had the right to determine the religion of its subjects. This was in an effort to curb the religious warfare that had wracked Europe after the [[Protestant Reformation]].

==United States==

Several of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] were confessional states, although of different denominations, before the [[American Revolution]]; [[Connecticut]] remained one until 1818. Other American states required each town or individual to support ''some'' religious body, without the state deciding which one; but this was also abolished, the last instance being [[Massachusetts]], which restricted the obligation in 1821 and ended it in 1843. Both systems are unconstitutional under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]], and preference in matters of religion was forbidden in several colonies.

==Modern times==

The confessional state is largely gone in the Western World, although in the [[Middle East]], the confessional state, particularly in the form of the [[Islamic republic]] is still quite common. A number of modern countries have state religions; they usually also allow [[freedom of religion]]. An example of such a state is [[Costa Rica]], a Catholic Confessional State. This status explains why sexual education, abortion and in vitro fertilization are considered highly controversial in Costa Rica.

'''Containment''' is a [[geopolitical]] strategy to stop the expansion of an enemy. It is best known as a [[Cold War]] foreign policy of the United States and its allies to prevent the spread of [[communism]]. As a component of the Cold War, this [[foreign policy|policy]] was a response to a series of moves by the [[Soviet Union]] to increase communist influence in [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Europe]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Africa]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Latin America]]. Containment represented a middle-ground position between [[detente]] and [[rollback]].

The basis of the [[doctrine]] was articulated in a [[Long Telegram|1946 cable]] by U.S. diplomat [[George F. Kennan]] during the post-[[World War II]] administration of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]]. As a description of [[U.S. foreign policy]], the word originated in a report Kennan submitted to [[U.S. Defense Secretary]] [[James Forrestal]] in 1947, which was later used in a magazine article. It is a translation of the French term'' [[cordon sanitaire]]'', which was used to describe Western policy toward the Soviet Union in the 1920s.

==Earlier uses of term==
There were major historical precedents familiar to Americans and Europeans. In the 1850s, anti-slavery forces in the United States developed a [[free soil]] strategy of containment, without using the word, to stop the expansion of slavery until it later collapsed. Historian [[James Oakes (historian)|James Oakes]] explains the strategy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Federal government would surround the south with free states, free territories, and free waters, building what they called a 'cordon of freedom' around slavery, hemming it in until the system's own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Oakes|title=Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MaVp-YES1F0C&amp;pg=PR12|year=2012|publisher=W. W. Norton|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Between 1873 and 1877, Germany repeatedly intervened in the internal affairs of France's neighbors. In Belgium, Spain, and Italy, Bismarck exerted strong and sustained political pressure to support the election or appointment of liberal, anticlerical governments. This was part of an integrated strategy to promote [[republicanism]] in France by strategically and ideologically isolating the clerical-monarchist regime of President [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon, Duke of Magenta|Patrice de Mac-Mahon]]. It was hoped that by ringing France with a number of liberal states, French republicans could defeat MacMahon and his reactionary supporters. The modern concept of containment provides a useful model for understanding the dynamics of this policy.&lt;ref&gt;James Stone, "Bismarck and the Containment of France, 1873–1877," ''Canadian Journal of History'' (1994) 29#2 pp 281–304 [http://utpjournalsreview.com/index.php/CJOH/article/download/10365/9240  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1917 [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in Russia, there were calls by Western leaders to isolate the Bolshevik government, which seemed intent on promoting worldwide revolution. In March 1919, French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] called for a ''cordon sanitaire'', a ring of non-communist states, to isolate the Soviet Union. Translating that phrase, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] called for a "quarantine." Both phrases compare communism to a contagious disease.

The U.S. initially refused to recognize the Soviet Union, but President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] reversed the policy in 1933 in the hope to expand American export markets.

The [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938 was a failed attempt to contain Nazi expansion in Europe. The U.S. tried to contain Japanese expansion in Asia in 1937 to 1941, and Japan reacted with its [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Pash, "Containment, Rollback and the Onset of the Pacific War, 1933-1941" in G. Kurt Piehler and Sidney Pash, eds. ''The United States and the Second World War: New Perspectives on Diplomacy, War, and the Home Front'' (2010) pp 38-67&lt;/ref&gt;

After Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in 1941 during [[World War II]], the U.S. and the Soviet Union found themselves [[Allies of World War II|allied]] against Germany and used [[rollback]] to defeat the [[Axis Powers]]: Germany, Italy, and Japan.

==Origin (1944–1947)==

Key State Department personnel grew increasingly frustrated with and suspicious of the Soviets as the war drew to a close. [[Averell Harriman]], U.S. Ambassador in Moscow, once a "confirmed optimist" regarding U.S.-Soviet relations,&lt;ref name="Larson69"&gt;Larson, Deborah Welch, ''Origins of Containment: A Psychological Explanation'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; was disillusioned by what he saw as the Soviet betrayal of the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]] as well as by violations of the February 1945 [[Yalta Agreement]] concerning [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="Larson116"&gt;Larson, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Harriman would later have a significant influence in forming Truman's views on the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Larson68"&gt;Larson, p.68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1946, the U.S. State Department asked [[George F. Kennan]], then at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, why the Russians opposed the creation of the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. He responded with a wide-ranging analysis of Russian policy now called the ''[[X Article|Long Telegram]]'':&lt;ref name="John Lewis Gaddis 2011 pp 201-24"&gt;John Lewis Gaddis, ''George F. Kennan: An American Life'' (2011) pp 201-24&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| Soviet power, unlike that of Hitlerite Germany, is neither schematic nor adventuristic. It does not work by fixed plans. It does not take unnecessary risks. Impervious to logic of reason, and it is highly sensitive to logic of force. For this reason it can easily withdraw—and usually does when strong resistance is encountered at any point.&lt;ref name="LongTel"&gt;Kennan, George, "[[s:The Long Telegram|The Long Telegram]]"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Kennan:

* The Soviets perceived themselves to be in a state of perpetual war with capitalism;
* The Soviets would use controllable Marxists in the capitalist world as allies;
* Soviet aggression was not aligned with the views of the Russian people or with economic reality, but with historic Russian xenophobia and paranoia;
* The Soviet government's structure prevented objective or accurate pictures of internal and external reality.

Kennan's cable was hailed in the State Department as "the appreciation of the situation that had long been needed."&lt;ref name="Larson28"&gt;Larson, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennan himself attributed the enthusiastic reception to timing: "Six months earlier the message would probably have been received in the State Department with raised eyebrows and lips pursed in disapproval. Six months later, it would probably have sounded redundant."&lt;ref name="Larson28"/&gt; [[Clark Clifford]] and [[George Elsey]] produced a report elaborating on the ''Long Telegram'' and proposing concrete policy recommendations based on its analysis. This report, which recommended "restraining and confining" Soviet influence, was presented to Truman on September 24, 1946.&lt;ref name="Hechler1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hechler|first=Ken|authorlink=Ken Hechler|title=Working with Truman: a personal memoir of the White House years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=92HTPugIIoIC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=23 September 2011|year=1996|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-1067-8|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1947, Kennan drafted an essay entitled "[[X Article|The Sources of Soviet Conduct]]."&lt;ref name="John Lewis Gaddis 2011 pp 201-24"/&gt; Navy Secretary [[James V. Forrestal]] gave permission for the report to be published in the journal ''Foreign Affairs'' under the pseudonym "X."&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, ''George F. Kennan: An American Life'' (2011) pp 249-75.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Douglas Brinkley]] has dubbed Forrestal "godfather of containment" on account of his work in distributing Kennan's writing.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/47988/william-g-hyland/driven-patriot-the-life-and-times-of-james-forrestal-the-chairman Driven Patriot: The Life And Times Of James Forrestal]"&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word "containment" originates from this so-called "X Article": "In these circumstances it is clear that the main element of any United States policy toward the Soviet Union must be that of long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian R. Lewis|title=The American Culture of War: A History of US Military Force from World War II to Operation Iraqi Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT0WQxnbdxIC&amp;pg=PA67|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennan later turned against the containment policy and noted several deficiencies in his X Article. He later said that by containment he meant not the containment of Soviet Power "by military means of a military threat, but the political containment of a political threat." &lt;ref&gt;George F. Kennan, ''Memoirs 1925-1950'' P. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Kennan admitted a failure in the article to specify the geographical scope of "containment", and that containment was not something he believed the United States could necessarily achieve everywhere successfully.&lt;ref&gt;George F. Kennan, ''Memoirs 1925-1950'' P. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harry S. Truman (1945–1953)==

After Republicans gained control of Congress in the 1946 elections, President Truman, a Democrat, made a dramatic speech that is often considered to mark the beginning of the [[Cold War]]. In March 1947, he requested that Congress appropriate $400 million in aid to the Greek and Turkish governments, which were fighting Communist subversion.&lt;ref name="Truman"&gt;[[s:Truman Doctrine|President Harry S. Truman's Address Before a Joint Session of Congress]], March 12, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; Truman pledged to, "support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures."&lt;ref name="Truman"/&gt; This pledge became known as the [[Truman Doctrine]]. Portraying the issue as a mighty clash between "totalitarian regimes" and "free peoples," the speech marks the adoption of containment as official U.S. policy. Congress appropriated the money.

Truman's motives on that occasion have been the subject of considerable scholarship and several schools of interpretation. In the orthodox explanation of [[Herbert Feis]], a series of aggressive Soviet actions in 1945–47 in Poland, Iran, Turkey, and elsewhere awakened the American public to the new danger to freedom to which Truman responded.&lt;ref name="Larson9"&gt;Larsen, Deborah Welch, ''Origins of Containment'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the revisionist view of [[William Appleman Williams]], Truman's speech was an expression of longstanding American expansionism.&lt;ref name="Larson9"/&gt; In the [[realpolitik]] view of [[Lynn E. Davis]], Truman was a naive idealist who unnecessarily provoked the Soviets by couching disputes in terms like democracy and freedom that were alien to the Communist vision.&lt;ref name="Larson15"&gt;Larson, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to psychological analysis by Deborah Larson, Truman felt a need to prove his decisiveness and feared that aides would make unfavorable comparisons between him and his predecessor, Roosevelt.&lt;ref name="Larson147"&gt;Larson, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; "I am here to make decisions, and whether they prove right or wrong I am going to take them," he once said.&lt;ref name="Larson145-46"&gt;Larson, pp 145-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The drama surrounding the announcement of the Truman Doctrine catered to president's self-image of a strong and decisive leader, but his real decision-making process was more complex and gradual. The timing of the speech was not a response to any particular Soviet action but to the fact that the Republican Party had just gained control of Congress.&lt;ref name="Larson302"&gt;Larson, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; Truman was little involved in drafting the speech and did not himself adopt the hard-line attitude that it suggested until several months later.&lt;ref name="LarsonXI"&gt;Larson, p. xi., p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

The British, with their own position weakened by economic distress, urgently called on the U.S. to take over the traditional British role in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence S. Wittner, ''American Intervention in Greece, 1943-1949'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; Undersecretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] took the lead in Washington, warning congressional leaders in late February 1947 that if the United States did not take over from the British, the result most probably would be a "Soviet breakthrough" that "might open three continents to Soviet penetration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dean Acheson|title=Present at the creation: my years in the State Department|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OirSz3Wtaa0C&amp;pg=PA219|year=1987|publisher=W W Norton|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Chace|authorlink=James Chace|title=Acheson: The Secretary Of State Who Created The American World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Jf32GR7t3IC&amp;pg=PA166|year=2008|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|pages=166–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truman was explicit about the challenge of Communism taking control of Greece. He won wide support from both parties as well as experts in foreign policy inside and outside the government. It was strongly opposed by the Left, notably by former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]], who ran against Truman in the 1948 presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Schuessler, "Absorbing The First Blow: Truman And The Cold War," ''White House Studies'' (2009) 9#3 pp 215-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Truman, under the guidance of Acheson, followed up his speech with a series of measures to contain Soviet influence in Europe, including the [[Marshall Plan]], or European Recovery Program, and [[NATO]], a 1949 military alliance between the U.S. and Western European nations. Because containment required detailed information about Communist moves, the government relied increasingly on the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Established by the National Security Act of 1947, the CIA conducted espionage in foreign lands, some of it visible, more of it secret. Truman approved a classified statement of containment policy called NSC 20/4 in November 1948, the first comprehensive statement of security policy ever created by the United States. The Soviet Union's first nuclear test in 1949 prompted the National Security Council to formulate a revised security doctrine. Completed in April 1950, it became known as [[NSC 68]].&lt;ref&gt;Efstathios T. Fakiolas, "Kennan's Long Telegram and NSC-68: A Comparative Theoretical Analysis," ''East European Quarterly'' (1997) 31#4 pp 415-433.&lt;/ref&gt;  It concluded that a massive military buildup was necessary to deal with the Soviet threat. According to the report, drafted by [[Paul Nitze]] and others:

{{quote|In the words of the Federalist (No. 28) "The means to be employed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief." The mischief may be a global war or it may be a Soviet campaign for limited objectives. In either case we should take no avoidable initiative which would cause it to become a war of annihilation, and if we have the forces to defeat a Soviet drive for limited objectives it may well be to our interest not to let it become a global war.&lt;ref name="Nitze"&gt;''[https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsc-hst/nsc-68-4.htm NSC 68: United States Objectives and Programs for National Security]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Alternative strategies==
There were three alternative policies to containment under discussion in the late 1940s. The first was a return to [[isolationism]], minimizing American involvement with the rest of the world, a policy that was supported by conservative Republicans, especially from the [[Midwest]], including former President [[Herbert Hoover]] and Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]. However, many other Republicans, led by Senator [[Arthur H. Vandenberg]], said that policy had helped cause World War II and so was too dangerous to revive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David McCullough]]|title=Truman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fp1A2s6aQwC&amp;pg=PA631|year=2003|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page=631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second policy was continuation of the [[détente]] policies that aimed at friendly relationships with the Soviet Union, especially trade. Roosevelt had been the champion of détente, but he was dead, and most of his inner circle had left the government by 1946. The chief proponent of détente was Henry  Wallace, a former vice president and the [[Secretary of Commerce]] under Truman. Wallace's position was supported by far left elements of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]], but they were purged in 1947 and 1948. Wallace ran against Truman on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] ticket in 1948, but his campaign was increasingly dominated by Communists, which helped to discredit détente.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jerel A. Rosati|author2=James M. Scott|title=The Politics of United States Foreign Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQjN0TpG7tAC&amp;pg=PA342|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third policy was [[rollback]], an aggressive effort to undercut or destroy the Soviet Union itself. Military rollback against the Soviet Union was proposed by [[James Burnham]]&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kelly, ''James Burnham and the Struggle for the World: A Life'' (2002) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; and other conservative strategists in the late 1940s. After 1954, Burnham and like-minded strategists became editors and regular contributors to [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]'s ''[[National Review]]'' magazine.

Truman himself adopted a rollback strategy in the [[Korean War]] after the success of the [[Inchon]] landings in September 1950, only to reverse himself after the Chinese [[counterattack]] two months later and revert to containment. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] called on Congress to continue the rollback policy, but Truman fired him for insubordination.&lt;ref&gt;James I. Matray, "Truman's Plan for Victory: National Self-Determination and the Thirty-Eighth Parallel Decision in Korea." ''Journal of American History'' (1979): 314-333. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1900879 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], a rollback strategy was considered against communism in [[Eastern Europe]] from 1953 to 1956. Eisenhower agreed to a propaganda campaign to rollback the influence of communism psychologically, but he refused to intervene in the 1956 [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]],&lt;ref&gt;László Borhi, "Rollback, Liberation, Containment, or Inaction? U.S. Policy and Eastern Europe in the 1950s", ''Journal of Cold War Studies'', 1#3 (1999), pp 67–110 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_cold_war_studies/v001/1.3borhi.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; mainly for fear that it would cause the [[Third World War]]. Since 1950, the Soviets had been known to possess [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert R. Bowie and Richard H. Immerman. eds.|title=Waging Peace: How Eisenhower Shaped an Enduring Cold War Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPHLOOMDP0UC&amp;pg=PA158|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=158–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korea==
[[File:Operation Dominic - Frigate Bird nuclear explosion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A 1962 [[nuclear explosion]] as seen through the periscope of a U.S. Navy submarine. The goal of containment was to 'contain' communism without a nuclear war.]]
The U.S. followed containment when it entered the [[Korean War]] to defend [[South Korea]] from a communist invasion by [[North Korea]]. However, the success of the [[Inchon landing]] inspired the U.S. and the [[United Nations]] to adopt a [[rollback]] strategy to overthrow communist North Korea, thus allowing nationwide elections under U.N. auspices.&lt;ref&gt;James I. Matray, "Truman's Plan for Victory: National Self-Determination and the Thirty-Eighth Parallel Decision in Korea," ''[[Journal of American History]]'', Sept. 1979, Vol. 66 Issue 2, pp. 314–333, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1900879 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Douglas MacArthur]] then advanced across the [[Division of Korea|38th parallel]] into North Korea. The Chinese then sent in a large army and defeated the U.N. forces, pushing them below the 38th parallel. Although the Chinese had been planning to intervene for months,&lt;ref name="AcademyC2000"&gt;[[Chinese Military Science Academy]] (September 2000). ''History of War to Resist America and Aid Korea'' (抗美援朝战争史) I. Beijing: Chinese Military Science Academy Publishing House. pp. 35–36. {{ISBN|7-80137-390-1}}. On 4 August 1950, with the proposed [[Chinese invasion of Taiwan]] aborted, [[Mao Zedong]] reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea as soon as the Taiwan invasion force was reorganized.&lt;/ref&gt; this action was interpreted by Truman's supporters as a response to U.S. forces crossing the 38th parallel. That interpretation allowed the episode to be used to confirm the wisdom of the containment doctrine as opposed to rollback. The Communists were later pushed back to around the original border. Truman blamed MacArthur's focus on victory and adopted a "[[limited war]]" policy. His focus shifted to negotiating a settlement, which was finally reached in 1953. For his part, MacArthur denounced Truman's "no-win policy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Safire, William]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jK-0NPoMiYoC Safire's Political Dictionary]'', p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dulles==

Many Republicans, including [[John Foster Dulles]], were concerned that Truman had been too timid. In 1952, Dulles called for rollback and the eventual liberation of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="StateDept"&gt;"[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/cwr/17601.htm Kennan and Containment, 1947]", ''Diplomacy in Action,'' U.S. Department of State,&lt;/ref&gt; Dulles was named secretary of state by incoming President Eisenhower, but Eisenhower's decision not to intervene during the 1956 Hungarian Uprising made containment a bipartisan doctrine. Eisenhower relied on clandestine CIA actions to undermine hostile governments and used economic and military foreign aid to strengthen governments supporting the American position in the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;John Prados, ''Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA,''  (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuba==
In the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962, the top officials in Washington debated using rollback to get rid of Soviet nuclear missiles, which were threatening the United States. There was fear of a [[nuclear war]] until a deal was reached in which the Soviets would publicly remove their nuclear weapons, the United States would secretly remove its missiles from Turkey and to avoid invading Cuba. The policy of containing Cuba was put into effect by President [[John F. Kennedy]] and continued until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Alice L. George, ''The Cuban missile crisis: The threshold of nuclear war'' (Routledge, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vietnam==
Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], the Republican candidate for president in 1964, challenged containment and asked, "Why not victory?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Jensen]], Jon Thares Davidann, Yoneyuki Sugita, ''Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century'', p. 178. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Lyndon Johnson]], the Democratic nominee, answered that rollback risked nuclear war. Johnson explained containment doctrine by quoting the Bible: "Hitherto shalt thou come, but not further."&lt;ref name="Jensen1"&gt;Jensen, p. 180. The quote is from [[Book of Job|Job]] 38:11.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldwater lost to Johnson in the 1964 election by a wide margin. Johnson adhered closely to containment during the [[Vietnam War]]. Rejecting proposals by General [[William Westmoreland]] for U.S. ground forces to advance into Laos and cut communist supply lines, Johnson gathered a group of elder statesmen called [[The Wise Men (book)|The Wise Men]]. The group included Kennan, Acheson and other former Truman advisors.

Rallies in support of the troops were discouraged for fear that a patriotic response would lead to demands for victory and rollback.&lt;ref name="Jensen1"/&gt; Military responsibility was divided among three generals so that no powerful theater commander could emerge to challenge Johnson as MacArthur had challenged Truman.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon, who replaced Johnson in 1969, referred to his foreign policy as détente, a relaxation of tension. Although it continued to aim at restraining the Soviet Union, it was based on political realism, thinking in terms of national interest, as opposed to crusades against communism or for democracy. Emphasis was placed on talks with the Soviet Union concerning nuclear weapons called the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]]. Nixon reduced U.S. military presence in Vietnam to the minimum required to contain communist advances, in a policy called [[Vietnamization]]. As the war continued, it grew less popular. A Democratic Congress forced Nixon, a Republican, to abandon the policy in 1973 by enacting the [[Case–Church Amendment]], which ended U.S. military involvement in Vietnam and led to successful communist invasions of South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.

==Afghanistan==
President [[Jimmy Carter]] came to office in 1977 and was committed to a foreign policy that emphasized [[human right]]s. However, in response to the Soviet invasion of [[Afghanistan]], containment was again made a priority. The wording of the [[Carter Doctrine]] (1980) intentionally echoed that of the Truman Doctrine.

==Reagan Doctrine==
{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--2 paragraphs without citations--&gt;
Following the communist victory of Vietnam, Democrats began to view further communist advance as inevitable, but Republicans returned to the rollback doctrine. [[Ronald Reagan]], a long-time advocate of rollback, was elected US President in 1980. He took a more aggressive approach to dealings with the Soviets and believed that détente was misguided and [[peaceful coexistence]] was tantamount to surrender. When the Soviet Union invaded [[Afghanistan]] in 1979, American policy makers worried that the Soviets were making a run for control of the Persian Gulf. Throughout the 1980s, under a policy that came to be known as the [[Reagan Doctrine]], the United States provided technical and economic assistance to the Afghan guerrillas fighting against the Soviet army ([[Mujahideen]]).&lt;ref&gt;Olson, James Stuart. Historical dictionary of the 1950s. Westport, Conn: Greenwood P, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

By sending military aid to anti-communist insurgents in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, and Nicaragua, Reagan confronted existing communist governments and went beyond the limits of containment doctrine. He deployed the [[Pershing II]] missile in Europe and promoted research on a [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], called "Star Wars" by its critics, to shoot down missiles fired at the United States.

Reagan's aim was to defeat the Soviets through an expensive arms buildup the Soviets could not match. However, Reagan continued to follow containment in several key areas. He pursued a comprehensive nuclear disarmament initiative called [[START I]] and policy toward Europe continued to emphasize a NATO-based defensive approach.

==After Cold War==
The [[history of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|end of the Cold War]] in 1991 marked the official end of the containment policy, but the U.S. kept its bases in the areas around Russia, such as those in Iceland, Germany, and Turkey. Also, much of the policy helped influence U.S. foreign policy in later years, such as during the [[War on Terror]] and dealing with post-Cold War dictators, such as [[Iraq]]'s [[Saddam Hussein]].

A '''deputy leader''' (in [[Scottish English]], sometimes '''depute leader''') in the [[Westminster system]] is the second-in-command of a [[political party]], behind the [[party leader]]. Deputy leaders often become [[deputy prime minister]] when their parties are elected to government. The deputy leader may take on the role of the leader if the current leader is, for some reason, unable to perform their role as leader. For example, the deputy leader often takes the place of the party leader at [[Question Time]] sessions in their absence. They also often have other responsibilities of party management.

'''Estragole''' ('''''p''-allylanisole''', '''methyl chavicol''') is a [[phenylpropene]], a natural organic compound. Its chemical structure consists of a [[benzene]] ring substituted with a [[methoxy group]] and a [[propenyl]] group.  It is an isomer of [[anethole]], differing with respect to the location of the double bond.  It is a colorless liquid, although impure samples can appear yellow.  It is a component of various trees and plants, including [[turpentine]] (pine oil), anise, fennel, bay, tarragon, and basil. It is used in the preparation of fragrances.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Karl-Georg Fahlbusch, Franz-Josef Hammerschmidt, Johannes Panten, Wilhelm Pickenhagen, Dietmar Schatkowski, Kurt Bauer, Dorothea Garbe, Horst Surburg "Flavors and Fragrances" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim: 2002. Published online: 15 January 2003; {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Production==
Hundreds of tonnes of [[basil oil]] are produced annually by steam distillation of ''[[Ocimum basilicum]]'' (common basil).  This oil is mainly estragole but also contains substantial amounts of [[linalool]].
Estragole is the primary constituent of [[essential oil]] of [[tarragon]] (comprising 60–75%). It is also present in [[pine oil]], [[turpentine]], [[fennel]], [[anise]] (2%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;), ''[[Clausena anisata]]'' and ''[[Syzygium anisatum]]''.

Estragole is used in perfumes and as a food additive for flavor.  Upon treatment with potassium hydroxide, estragole converts to [[anethole]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; A known use of estragole is in the synthesis of [[magnolol]].

==Safety==
Estragole is suspected to be carcinogenic and [[genotoxic]], as is indicated by a report of the European Union, Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products.&lt;ref&gt;EMEA/HMPC/137212/2005, Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products. Final Public Statement on the Use of Herbal Medicinal Products Containing Estragole http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2010/04/WC500089960.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have clearly established that the profiles of metabolism, metabolic activation, and covalent binding are dose dependent and that the relative importance diminishes markedly at low levels of exposure (i.e. these events are not linear with respect to dose). In particular, [[animal testing on rodents|rodent studies]] show that these events are minimal probably in the dose range of 1–10&amp;nbsp;mg/kg body weight, which is approximately 100-1000 times the anticipated human exposure to this substance. For these reasons it is concluded that the present exposure to estragole resulting from consumption of herbal medicinal products (short time use in adults at recommended posology) does not pose a significant cancer risk. In the meantime exposure of estragole to sensitive groups such as young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women should be minimized. 

The Scientific Committee on Food from the Health &amp; Consumer Protection Directorate-General took a more concerned position and concluded that "Estragole has been demonstrated to be genotoxic and carcinogenic. Therefore the existence of a threshold cannot be assumed and the Committee could not establish a safe exposure limit. Consequently, reductions in exposure and restrictions in use levels are indicated."&lt;ref&gt;SCF/CS/FLAV/FLAVOUR/6, 26 September 2001, Opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food on Estragole (1-Allyl-4-methoxybenzene){{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out104_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302102822/http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out104_en.pdf |archivedate=2007-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sovereignty]] over the [[Falkland Islands]] ({{lang-es|Islas Malvinas}}) is disputed by [[Argentina]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

The British claim to sovereignty dates from 1690, and the United Kingdom has exercised ''[[de facto]]'' sovereignty over the [[archipelago]] almost continuously since 1833. Argentina has long disputed this claim, having been in control of the islands for a few years prior to 1833. The dispute escalated in 1982, when [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|Argentina invaded the islands]], precipitating the [[Falklands War]].

Contemporary Falkland Islanders overwhelmingly prefer to remain British.  They gained full British [[citizenship]] with the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]], after British victory in the Falklands War.

==Historical basis of the dispute==

===French settlement===
[[File:Louis-Antoine de Bougainville portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|French nobleman, Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]
France was the first country to establish [[de facto]] control in the Falkland Islands, with the foundation of Port Saint Louis in [[East Falkland]] by French explorer [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], in 1764. The French colony consisted of a small fort and some settlements with a population of around 250. The Islands were named after the Breton port of [[St. Malo]] as the ''Îles Malouines'', which remains the French name for the islands. In 1766, France agreed to leave the islands to Spain, with Spain reimbursing de Bougainville and the St. Malo Company for the cost of the settlement.&lt;ref name="StMaloCompanyReimbursed"&gt;

The following year, the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] between those countries agreed that the dividing line between the two should be 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde Islands]].&lt;ref name="Dawson1899"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Edward Dawson|title=The Lines of demarcation of Pope Alexander VI and the Treaty of Tordesillas A.D. 1493 and 1494|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xBUNAQAAMAAJ|year=1899|publisher=Hope &amp; Sons|page=543}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Falklands lie on the western (Spanish) side of this line.

Spain made claims that the Falkland Islands were held under provisions in the 1713 [[s:Peace and Friendship Treaty of Utrecht between Spain and Great Britain|Treaty of Utrecht]] which settled the limits of the [[Spanish Empire]] in the [[Americas]]. However, the treaty only promised to restore the territories in the Americas held prior to the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. The Falkland Islands was not held at the time, and were not mentioned in the treaty. When Spain discovered the British and French colonies on the Islands, a diplomatic row broke out among the claimants. In 1766, Spain and France, who were allies at the time, agreed that France would hand over Port Saint Louis, and Spain would repay the cost of the settlement. France insisted that Spain maintain the colony in Port Louis and thus prevent Britain from claiming the title to the Islands and Spain agreed.&lt;ref name="Laver"/&gt;  Spain and Great Britain enjoyed uneasy relations at the time, and no corresponding agreement was reached.&lt;ref name="briefhistory2"/&gt;

The Spanish took control of Port Saint Louis and renamed it [[Puerto Soledad]] in 1767. On 10 June 1770, a Spanish expedition expelled the British colony at [[Port Egmont]], and Spain took [[de facto]] control of the Islands. Spain and Great Britain came close to war over the issue, but instead, concluded a treaty on 22 January 1771, allowing the British to return to Port Egmont with neither side relinquishing sovereignty claims.&lt;ref name = "1771Declaration"&gt;

From 1774 to 1811, the islands were ruled as part of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Viceroyalty of the River Plate]]. In that period, 18 governors were appointed to rule the islands.

[[Luis Vernet]] approached the British for permission to build a settlement at the former Spanish settlement of [[Puerto Soledad]], initially in 1826&lt;ref name="Cawkell2001a" /&gt;{{rp|48}} and again in 1828,&lt;ref name="Cawkell2001a" /&gt;{{rp|50}} following the failure of the earlier 1824 expedition.&lt;ref name="Cawkell1983" /&gt;{{rp|31}} In addition, Vernet requested British protection for his settlement in the event of their returning to the islands.&lt;ref name="Cawkell2001a" /&gt;{{rp|50}} After receiving assurances from the British minister [[chargé d'affaires]], Sir [[Woodbine Parish]], Vernet provided regular reports to the British on the progress of his enterprise.

Britain protested again when Vernet announced his intention to exercise exclusive rights over fishing and sealing in the islands. (Similar protests were received from the American representative, who protested at the curtailment of established rights and stated that the United States did not recognise the jurisdiction of the United Provinces over the islands.)&lt;ref name="PETERSON1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold F.

The [[History of the Falkland Islands#USS Lexington raid|raid]] of the {{USS|Lexington|1825|6}} in December 1831 combined with the United Provinces assertions of sovereignty were the spur for the British to establish a military presence on the islands.

[[File:HMS Clio c1812.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=A sketch believed to be HMS Clio|Sketch of a brig-sloop, probably HMS Clio, by Cmdr. William Farrington, c. 1812]]
On 2 January 1833, Captain James Onslow, of the brig-sloop [[HMS Clio (1807)|HMS ''Clio'']], arrived at the Spanish settlement at Port Louis to request that the Argentine flag be replaced with the British one, and that the Argentine administration leave the islands.

The colony was set up and the islands continued under a British presence until the [[Falklands War]].

After their return in 1833, the British did not attempt to develop the islands as a colony. Initially, plans were based upon the settlers remaining in Port Louis, supported by the annual visit of a warship. Vernet's deputy, [[Matthew Brisbane]], returned in March 1833 to take charge of the settlement and was encouraged to further Vernet's business interests provided he did not seek to assert Argentine Government authority.&lt;ref name="Destéfani1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Darwin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CPEL"&gt;[http://www.cpel.uba.ar/filargenta/correo/malv0020.htm Islas del Atlántico Sur, Islas Malvinas, Historia, Ocupación británica: Port Stanley (Puerto Argentino)].

The first British Resident, Lt Smith, was established in 1834 and under his administration and initiative the settlement recovered and began to prosper. Lt Smith's commanding officer was not enthusiastic about Royal Navy officers engaged in encouraging commerce, and rebuked Smith. Smith resigned, and subsequent Residents allowed the settlement to stagnate.

In 1841, [[Juan Manuel de Rosas|General Rosas]] offered to relinquish any Argentine territorial claims in return for relief of debts owed to [[Barings Bank]] in the [[City of London]]. The British Government chose to ignore the offer.&lt;ref name="Rosas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.falklands.info/history/history1.html | title=Falkland Islands Newsletter, No.14, May 1983 | publisher=falklands.info | work=The Long View of the Falklands Situation | accessdate=19 July 2007 | last=Lewis | first=Jason | author2=Inglis, Alison | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006062930/http://www.falklands.info/history/history1.html | archivedate=6 October 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1840, under pressure from merchants in London, the decision was made{{Fix|text=by whom?}} to establish a permanent colony in the Falklands. A British colonial administration was formed in 1842. This was expanded in 1908, when in addition to [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], claimed in 1775, and the [[South Shetland Islands]], claimed in 1820, the UK unilaterally declared sovereignty over more Antarctic territory south of the Falklands, including the [[South Sandwich Islands]], the [[South Orkney Islands]], and [[Graham Land]], grouping them into the Falkland Islands Dependencies.

In 1850, the [[Arana-Southern Treaty]] otherwise known as the [[s:1850 Convention of Settlement|Convention of Settlement]] was signed between the United Kingdom and Argentina. It has been argued by [[Arana-Southern Treaty#Historians’ opinions|several authors]] on both sides of the dispute that Argentina tacitly gave up her claim by failing to mention it and ceasing to protest over the Falklands. Between December 1849 and 1941, the Falklands were not mentioned in the President's Messages to Congress.

Following the introduction of the [[Antarctic Treaty System]] in 1959 the Falkland Islands Dependencies were reduced to include just South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Territory south of the 60th parallel was formed into a new dependency, the [[British Antarctic Territory]], which overlaps claims by Argentina ([[Argentine Antarctica]]) and [[Chile]] ([[Antártica Chilena Province]]).

In 1976 the British Government commissioned a study on the future of the Falklands, which looked at the ability of the islands to sustain themselves, and the potential for economic development. The study was led by [[Edward Shackleton, Baron Shackleton|Lord Shackleton]], son of the Antarctic explorer, [[Ernest Shackleton]]. Argentina reacted with fury to the study and refused to allow Lord Shackleton permission to travel to the islands from Argentina, forcing the British to send a [[Royal Navy]] ship to transport him to the islands. In response Argentina severed diplomatic links with the UK. An Argentine naval vessel later fired upon the ship carrying Shackleton as he visited his father's grave in South Georgia.

Shackleton's report found that contrary to popular belief, the Falkland Islands actually produced a surplus by its economic activities, and was not dependent on British aid to survive. However the report stressed the need for a political settlement if further economic growth was to be achieved, particularly from the exploitation of any natural resources in the water around the islands.

[[File:FalklandIslands1794.jpg|thumb|200px|800px|center|A map from a world atlas published in 1794 complete with marginal notes describing sovereignty: the Falklands belonged "to Great Britain by right of first discovery", the British had "a fort and settlement" on "the North of Western Falkland", while Spaniards "had a fort in the Eastern Isle".]]

In October 1820, the [[frigate]] [[Heroína (ship)|''Heroína'']], under the command of American [[privateer]] Colonel [[David Jewett]], arrived in [[Puerto Soledad]] after an eight-month voyage and with most of her crew incapacitated by scurvy and other disease. A storm had severely damaged the ''Heroína'' and had sunk a Portuguese ship pirated by Jewett called the ''Carlota''.&lt;ref&gt;Report dated 30 April 1822 by Portuguese Auditor General of Marine, Manuel José de Figueredo; translated version reprinted in William R.

Weddell reported that only thirty seamen and forty soldiers out of a complement of 200 were fit for duty, and that Jewett slept with pistols over his head following an attempted mutiny. On 6 November 1820, Jewett raised the flag of the United Provinces of the River Plate and claimed possession of the islands for the new state. Weddell reported that the letter he received from Jewett read:&lt;ref name="Weddell"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Voyage Towards the South Pole | publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green | last=Weddell | first=James | authorlink=James Weddell | year=1827 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823, the Buenos Aires government granted land on [[East Falkland]] to Jorge Pacheco, a businessman from Buenos Aires who owed money to the merchant [[Luis Vernet]].&lt;ref name="Caillet-Bois"&gt;{{cite book | title=Las Islas Malvinas | publisher=Ediciones Peuser | author=Caillet-Bois, Ricardo R. | year=1952 | edition=2nd | pages=195–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; A first expedition travelled to the islands the following year, arriving on the East Falkland on 2 February 1824. This was deemed as "a failure" by author Mary Cawkell:&lt;ref name="Cawkell1983" /&gt;{{rp|31}} "A week after arrival in February 1824, Areguati sent a despairing letter to Pacheco."&lt;ref name="Cawkell2001a" /&gt;{{rp|47}} Its leader was Pablo Areguatí, who brought with him 25 gauchos. Ten days later Areguatí wrote that the colony was perishing because the horses they had brought were too weak to be used, thus they could not capture wild cattle and their only other means of subsistence was wild rabbits. On 7 June, Areguatí left the islands, taking with him 17 gauchos. On 24 July, the remaining eight gauchos were rescued by the ''Susannah Anne'', a British sealer. After the failure, Pacheco agreed to sell his share{{Fix|text=of what?}} to Vernet.&lt;ref name="Caillet-Bois" /&gt;

A second attempt, in 1826, sanctioned by the British &lt;ref name="Cawkell2001a" /&gt;{{rp|48}} (but delayed until winter by a Brazilian blockade), also failed after arrival in the islands.&lt;ref name="Cawkell2001a" /&gt;{{rp|52}} In 1828, the Buenos Aires government granted Vernet all of East Falkland, including all its resources, with exemption from taxation for 20 years, if a colony could be established within three years. He took settlers, including British Captain Matthew Brisbane, and before leaving once again sought permission from the British Consulate in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="Cawkell2001a" /&gt;{{rp|50}} The British asked for a report on the islands for the British government, and Vernet asked for British protection should they return.&lt;ref name="Cawkell2001a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="briefhistory3"&gt;

On Vernet's return to the Falklands, Puerto Soledad was renamed Puerto Luis. The Buenos Aires Government, headed by [[Juan Lavalle|General Juan Galo de Lavalle]] (who took the governorship by force on 1 December 1828, and executed the elected governor [[Manuel Dorrego]]) appointed Vernet "Political and Military Commander" in a decree of 13 June 1829. The British objected to this as an Argentine attempt to foster political and economic ties to the islands. One of Vernet's first acts was to curb [[seal hunting]] on the islands to conserve the dwindling seal population. In response, the British [[consul (representative)|consul]] at [[Buenos Aires]] protested the move and restated the claim of his government. Islanders were born during this period (including Malvina María Vernet y Saez, Vernet's daughter).&lt;ref name="briefhistory3"/&gt;

Vernet later seized three American ships, the ''Harriet'', ''Superior'' and ''Breakwater'', for disobeying his restrictions on seal hunting. The ''Breakwater'' escaped to raise the alarm and the ''Superior'' was allowed to continue its work for Vernet's benefit. Property on board the ''Harriet'' was seized and Vernet returned with it to [[Buenos Aires]] for the captain to stand trial. The American Consul in Argentina protested Vernet's actions and stated that the United States did not recognise Argentine sovereignty in the Falklands. The consul dispatched a warship, the [[USS Lexington (1825)|USS ''Lexington'']], to [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Puerto Luis]] to [[Falklands Expedition|retake]] the confiscated property.

By 1831, the colony was successful enough to be advertising for new colonists, although a report by the captain of the ''Lexington'' suggests that the conditions on the islands were quite miserable.&lt;ref name = "Duncan"&gt;[[s:Report by Silas Duncan Commander U.S.S.

Upon leaving to return to [[Montevideo]], the captain of the ''Lexington'' declared the islands to be ''[[res nullius]]'' (nobody's property).&lt;ref name="briefhistory3"/&gt; (Darwin's visit in 1833 confirmed the squalid conditions in the settlement, although Captain Matthew Brisbane (Vernet's deputy) later insisted that these were the result of the attack by the ''Lexington''.)&lt;ref name = "Darwin"&gt;FitzRoy, R. 1839.

Vol. II.&lt;/ref&gt; Vernet had returned to Buenos Aires in 1831 before the attack, and resigned as governor. An interim governor, [[Esteban Mestivier|Esteban José Francisco Mestivier]], was appointed by the Buenos Aires Government. He arrived at Puerto Luis with his family aboard the schooner ''Sarandí'' in October 1832.&lt;ref name="briefhistory3"/&gt; Mestivier's appointment again drew protests from the British consul in Buenos Aires.

The ''Sarandí'', under the command of its captain, José María Pinedo, then began to patrol the surrounding seas. Upon its return to Puerto Luis on 29 December 1832, the ''Sarandí'' found the colony in an uproar. In Pinedo's absence there had been a mutiny led by a man named Gomila; Mestivier had been murdered and his wife raped. The captain of the French vessel ''Jean Jacques'' had meanwhile provided assistance, disarming and incarcerating the mutineers. Pinedo dispatched the mutineers to Buenos Aires with the British schooner ''Rapid''. Gomila was condemned to exile, while seven other mutineers were executed.

On 2 January 1833, Captain John Onslow arrived and delivered written requests that Pinedo lower the Argentine flag in favour of the British one, and that the Argentine administration leave the islands. Pinedo asked if war had been declared between Argentina and the United Kingdom; Onslow replied that it had not. Nonetheless, Pinedo, heavily outmanned and outgunned, left the islands under protest, with the Argentine flag being lowered by British officers and delivered to him. Argentines subsequently claimed that the population of Puerto Luis was expelled at the same time, though contemporary sources dispute this, suggesting that the colonists were encouraged to remain under Vernet's deputy, Matthew Brisbane. It is also documented that at least 27 members of Vernet's colony were still in residence in the islands in July 1833.&lt;ref name="briefhistory3"/&gt; Back on the mainland, Pinedo faced court martial; he was suspended for four months and transferred to the army, though he was recalled to the navy in 1845.

===Sovereignty dispute===
It is said that in 1833, [[Manuel Moreno]] (representing the United Provinces) protested against the British occupation of the islands, and the issue was then debated in the Argentine Congress every year until 1849, with a formal protest issued each year. The British government denies this. It is also stated that the British rejected the initial protest, and did not answer the subsequent protests; and that the matter was not raised again in Congress until 1941.

The American sealing vessels ''Harriet'' and ''Breakwater'' that had been seized by Vernet (see above) brought claims against their insurers, and in 1839 these claims reached the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of ''Williams v. Suffolk Insurance Company''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/38/415/case.html|title=Williams v. Suffolk Insurance Company :: 38 U.S. 415 (1839) :: Justia U.S. Supreme Court Center|work=Justia Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insurers argued that Vernet was the legal governor of the Falkland Islands, the sealing was therefore illegal and so they ought not to have to pay. The ruling of the Supreme Court was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The government of the United States having insisted, and continuing to insist, through its regular executive authority, that the Falkland Islands do not constitute any part of the dominions within the sovereignty of Buenos Ayres, and that the seal fishery at those islands is a trade free and lawful to the citizens of the United States, and beyond the competence of the Buenos Ayres government to regulate, prohibit, or punish, it is not competent for a circuit court of the United States to inquire into and ascertain by other evidence the title of the government of Buenos Ayres to the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1850 [[s:1850 Convention of Settlement|Convention of Settlement]], otherwise known as the [[Arana-Southern Treaty]], which did not mention the islands, agreed to restore "perfect relations of friendship" between the two countries. There were no further protests until 1885, when Argentina included the Falkland Islands in an officially sponsored map.{{citation needed|reason=The Bluth paper quite simply does not support the proposition for which it is cited.|date=April 2015}}. In 1888, Argentina made an offer to have the matter subject to arbitration, but this was rejected by the British Government.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}. Other than the protest lodged in 1885, the British Government did not acknowledge any further protests by Argentina until the 1940s, although the official position of the Argentine Government is that "During the first half of the twentieth century, the successive Argentine governments made it standard practice to submit protests to the United Kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrecic.gov.ar/portal/seree/malvinas/homeing.html |title=Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores, Argentina’s Position on Different Aspects of the Question of the Malvinas Islands |publisher=Mrecic.gov.ar |accessdate=2013-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106192913/http://www.mrecic.gov.ar/portal/seree/malvinas/homeing.html |archivedate=6 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Argentine Government does not identify these annual protests, but authors such as Roberto Laver &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cNKtX4mYVZUC |title = The Falklands/Malvinas case: breaking the deadlock in the Anglo-Argentine sovereignty dispute |last = Laver |first = Roberto C |year = 2001 |publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|pages= 88–89|isbn = 9789041115348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claim at least "27 sovereignty claims, both to Britain, domestically in Argentina and to international bodies".

Following [[World War II]], the [[British Empire]] declined, and many colonies in [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and the [[Caribbean]] gained their independence. Argentina saw this as an opportunity to push its case for gaining sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, and raised the issue in the [[United Nations]], first stating its claim after joining the UN in 1945. Following this claim, the United Kingdom offered to take the dispute over the Falkland Islands Dependencies to mediation at the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[The Hague]] (1947,&lt;ref name="MODRAF"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110606073350/http://www.raf.mod.uk/falklands/preface.html The Falkland Islands, A history of the 1982 conflict, Preface to a conflict].

On each occasion Argentina declined.

In 1965, the United Nations passed a [[UN General Assembly Resolution|resolution]] calling on the UK and Argentina to proceed with negotiations on finding a peaceful solution to the sovereignty question which would be "bearing in mind the provisions and objectives of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] and of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the interests of the population of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)."&lt;ref name="UN2065"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/2065(XX)&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=RESOLUTION | title=UN 2065 (XX).

A series of talks between the two nations took place over the next 17 years until 1981, but failed to reach a conclusion on sovereignty. Although the sovereignty discussions had some success in establishing economic and transport links between the Falklands and Argentina, there was no progress on the question of sovereignty of the islands.

Following the signing of the Communications Agreement, on 3 July 1971 the [[Argentine Air Force]] broke the islands' airways isolation by opening an air route with an amphibious flight from [[Comodoro Rivadavia]] with [[HU-16 Albatross|Grumman HU-16B Albatross]] aircraft operated by [[LADE]], Argentina's military airline. In 1972, after an Argentine request, the United Kingdom agreed to allow Argentina to construct a temporary air strip near Stanley. On 15 November 1972 a temporary runway was inaugurated with the first arrival of a [[Fokker F-27]]; subsequent flights arrived twice weekly. Flights were improved in 1978 with [[Fokker F-28]] jets, after the completion of a permanent runway funded by the British Government. This service, the only air connection to the islands, was maintained until the 1982 war.&lt;ref name="LADE"&gt;[http://www1.hcdn.gov.ar/proyxml/expediente.asp?fundamentos=si&amp;numexp=4812-D-2006 H.Cámara de Diputados de la Nación] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20121129035731/http://www1.hcdn.gov.ar/proyxml/expediente.asp?fundamentos=si&amp;numexp=4812-D-2006 |date=29 November 2012 }}.

Also [[Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales|YPF]], which was then the Argentine national oil and gas company, was in charge of supplying the island regularly.&lt;ref name="FAA_Falklands"&gt;[http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/conflicto/1971_1982.html ''La Fuerza Aérea en Malvinas desde 1971 hasta 1982''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114052302/http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/conflicto/1971_1982.html |date=14 January 2007 }}. Argentine Air Force.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst maintaining the British claim, the British Government considered a transfer of sovereignty less than two years before the outbreak of war.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jun/28/falklands.past | title=UK held secret talks to cede sovereignty: ''Minister met junta envoy in Switzerland, official war history reveals'' | work=The Guardian | date=2005-06-28 | accessdate=2013-01-05 |author1=Norton-Taylor, Richards |author2=Evans, Rob }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the British Government had limited room for manoeuvre owing to the strength of the Falkland Islands lobby in the [[Houses of Parliament]]. Any measure that the Foreign Office suggested on the sovereignty issue was loudly condemned by the islanders, who reiterated their determination to remain British. This led to the British Government maintaining a position that the right to [[self-determination]] of the islanders was paramount. But Argentina did not recognise the rights of the islanders, and so negotiations on the sovereignty issue remained at a stalemate.&lt;ref name="GrahamBound"&gt;{{cite book | title=Falkland Islanders at War | publisher=Pen &amp; Swords Ltd | author=Bound, Graham | year=2002 | isbn=1-84415-429-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Argentina landed an expedition in [[Southern Thule]], an island in the [[South Sandwich Islands]] which at that time was part of the Falkland Islands Dependency. The landing was reported in the UK only in 1978, although the British government issued a rejection of the notion of sending a force of [[Royal Marines]] to dismantle the Argentine base [[Corbeta Uruguay]].

There was a more serious confrontation in 1977 when the Argentine Navy cut off the fuel supply to Port Stanley Airport, and said they would no longer fly the [[Red Ensign]] in Falklands waters. (Traditionally ships in a foreign country's waters would fly the country's maritime flag as a courtesy.) The British Government suspected Argentina would attempt another expedition in the manner of its Southern Thule operation. [[James Callaghan]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], ordered the dispatch of a nuclear submarine, [[HMS Dreadnought (S101)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] and the [[frigate]]s [[HMS Alacrity (F174)|''Alacrity'']] and [[HMS Phoebe (F42)|''Phoebe'']] to the South Atlantic, with rules of engagement set in the event of a clash with the Argentine navy. The British even considered setting up an exclusion zone around the islands, but this was rejected in case it escalated matters. These events were not made public until the Parliamentary debates in 1982 during the Falklands War.

===Falklands War===
[[File:LocationFalklandIslands.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Location of the Falkland Islands]]
{{Main article|Falklands War}}

The Falklands War of 1982 was the largest and most severe armed conflict over the sovereignty of the islands. It started following the occupation of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] by Argentine scrap merchants whose number included some Argentine Marines. However, the UK had also reduced its presence in the Islands by announcing the withdrawal of [[HMS Endurance (1967)|HMS ''Endurance'']], the Royal Navy's icebreaker ship and only permanent presence in the South Atlantic. The UK had also denied Falkland Islanders full British [[citizenship]] under the [[British Nationality Act 1981]].

[[File:Jorge Anaya.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Commander-in-chief of the Argentine Navy, Admiral Jorge Anaya]]
In 1982, Argentina was in the midst of a devastating economic crisis and large-scale civil unrest against the repressive [[Proceso de Reorganización Nacional|military junta]] that was governing the country. On 2 April, with [[Argentine Navy]] commander-in-chief Admiral [[Jorge Anaya]] as the main architect and supporter of the operation, a combined Argentine amphibious force [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invaded the Islands]]. Immediately, the UK severed diplomatic ties with Argentina, and began to assemble a task force to retake the Islands. A diplomatic offensive began, to gain support for economic and military sanctions. The [[United Nations Security Council]] issued [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 502|Resolution 502]] calling on Argentina to withdraw forces from the Islands and on both parties to seek a diplomatic solution.&lt;ref name="UN502"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/435/26/IMG/NR043526.pdf?OpenElement | title=UN Resolution 502 (1982) | work=United Nations Security Council 2350th meeting | date=3 April 1982 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203085518/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/435/26/IMG/NR043526.pdf?OpenElement | archivedate=3 February 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another resolution&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/05/world/un-resolution-on-falkland-war.html | title=U.N. Resolution on Falkland War | work=New York Times | date=5 June 1982 | accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; called for an immediate ceasefire, but this was vetoed by both the United States and the United Kingdom. The European Community condemned the invasion and imposed economic sanctions on Argentina, although several EC states expressed reservations about British policy in this area, and two EC states ([[Denmark]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]) defected{{clarify|date=July 2017}} from co-operation.&lt;ref name = "Columbia"&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/class/ips216/Readings/martin_92.pdf ''Sanctions during Falkland Islands Conflict'']. Columbia International Affairs Online.&lt;/ref&gt; France and Germany also temporarily suspended several military contracts with the Argentine military. The United States supported mediated talks, via Secretary of State [[Alexander Haig]], and initially took a neutral stance, although in private substantial material aid was made available to the UK from the moment of invasion. The US publicly supported the UK's position following the failure of peace talks.

The British Task Force began offensive action against Argentina on 23 April 1982 and recaptured South Georgia after a short naval engagement. The operation to recover the Falkland Islands began on 1 May, and after fierce naval and air engagements an amphibious landing was made at [[Port San Carlos|San Carlos Bay]] on 21 May. On 14 June the Argentine forces surrendered, and control of the islands returned to the UK. Two Royal Navy ships then sailed to the [[South Sandwich Islands]] and expelled the Argentine military from [[Thule Island]], leaving no Argentine presence in the Falkland Islands Dependencies.

===Post-war===
Following the 1982 war, the British increased their presence in the Falkland Islands. [[RAF Mount Pleasant]] was constructed. This allowed fighter jets to be based on the islands and strengthened the UK's ability to reinforce the Islands at short notice. The military garrison was substantially increased and a new garrison was established on [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]. The Royal Navy [[Standing Royal Navy deployments#Atlantic Patrol Task (South)|South Atlantic patrol]] was strengthened to include both HMS ''Endurance'' and a Falkland Islands guard ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/operations/south-atlantic/falkland-islands-patrol-vessel|title=Falkland Islands Patrol Vessel|publisher=Royal Navy|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as this military build-up, the UK also passed the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]], which granted full British citizenship to the islanders. To show British commitment to the islands, high-profile British dignitaries visited the Falklands, including [[Margaret Thatcher]], the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] and [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra, The Hon Lady Ogilvy]]. The UK has also pursued links to the islands from Chile, which had provided help to British Forces during the Falklands War. [[LATAM Chile|LATAM]] now provides a direct air link to Chile from Mount Pleasant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/02/falklands-argentina-direct-flights|title=Argentine president calls for direct flights from Falklands to Buenos Aires|last=Goni|first=Uki|date=March 1, 2012|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies]], comprising at that time the island groups of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and [[Shag Rocks, South Georgia|Shag Rocks]] and [[Clerke Rocks]], became a distinct [[British overseas territory]] — [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].

Under the 1985 constitution the Falkland Islands Government (FIG) became a parliamentary representative democratic dependency, with the governor as head of government and representative of the Queen. Members of the FIG are democratically elected, the governor is effectively a figurehead. Theoretically the governor has the power under the 1985 constitution to exercise executive authority, in practice he is obliged to consult the [[Executive Council of the Falkland Islands|Executive Council]] in the exercise of his functions. The main responsibilities of the governor are external affairs and public services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/south-america/falkland-islands/?profile=politics&amp;pg=7 |title=Country Profile: Falkland Islands (British Overseas Territory) |publisher=Fco.gov.uk |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=15 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524122425/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/south-america/falkland-islands/?profile=politics&amp;pg=7 |archivedate=24 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively under this constitution, the Falkland Islands are self-governing with the exception of foreign policy, although the FIG represents itself at the [[United Nations Special Committee on Decolonisation]] as the British Government no longer attends.

Relations between the UK and Argentina remained hostile after 1982, and diplomatic relations were restored in 1989. Although the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling for the UK and Argentina to return to negotiations over the Islands' future,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r009.htm | title=UN A/RES/37/9. Question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) | work=United Nations General Assembly | date=4 November 1982 | accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the UK ruled out any further talks over the Islands' sovereignty. The UK has also maintained controls on arms exports to Argentina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/current-arms-embargoes-and-other-restrictions | title=UK current arms embargo | publisher=United Kingdom Government | accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although these were relaxed in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/18/world/britain-eases-post-falklands-arms-embargo-against-argentina.html | title=Britain Eases Post-Falklands Arms Embargo Against Argentina | work=New York Times | date=18 December 1998 | accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between the UK and Argentina improved further in the 1990s. In 1998, [[Carlos Menem]], the [[President of Argentina]], visited London, where he reaffirmed his country's claims to the Islands, although he stated that Argentina would use only peaceful means for their recovery. In 2001, [[Tony Blair]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], visited Argentina and said he hoped the UK and Argentina could resolve their differences that led to the 1982 war. However, no talks on sovereignty took place during the visit, and Argentina's President [[Néstor Kirchner]] stated that he regarded gaining sovereignty over the islands as a "top priority" of his government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_3063000/3063463.stm | title=Blair y Kirchner adelantaron diálogo | work=BBC World Service | date=14 July 2003 | accessdate=14 June 2010 | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentina renewed claims in June 2006, citing concern over fishing and petroleum rights; the UK changed from annually granting fishing concessions, to granting a 25-year concession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/argentina/1522729/Argentina-renews-campaign-over-Falklands-claim.html | title=Argentina renews campaign over Falklands claim | work=The Telegraph | date=30 June 2006 | author=McDermott, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 March 2009, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown stated that there was "nothing to discuss" with [[Cristina Kirchner]], the Argentine president, over sovereignty of the islands, when they met in Chile on his pre-[[2009 G-20 London Summit]] world tour.&lt;ref name="Times5991995"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article2027614.ece | title=Gordon Brown rejects Argentina’s claim to the Falklands | work=The Times (London) | date=28 March 2009 | author=Bourne, Brendan}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 April 2009 Argentina presented to the UN a formal claim to an area of the continental shelf encompassing the Falklands, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, and parts of Antarctica, citing 11 years worth of maritime survey data.&lt;ref name="BBC8011539"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8011539.stm | title=Argentina claims vast ocean area | work=BBC News | date=22 April 2009 | author=Piette, Candace}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK quickly protested these claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-1172802/Not-fast-says-Britain-Argentina-makes-fresh-appeal-UN-Falkland-Islands.html | title='Not so fast,' says Britain as Argentina makes fresh appeal to UN over Falkland Islands | work=The Mail on Sunday | date=23 April 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, in response to British plans to begin drilling for oil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/world/americas/oil+drilling+begins+in+the+falkland+islands/3554857.html | title=Oil drilling begins in the Falkland Islands | work=Channel 4 News | date=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Argentine government announced that ships travelling to the Falklands (as well as South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands) would require a permit to use Argentine territorial waters. The British and Falkland governments stated that this announcement did not affect the waters surrounding the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8518982.stm | title=Argentina toughens shipping rules in Falklands oil row | work=BBC | date=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.casarosada.gov.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6926 |title=Press conference with Chief Cabinet Aníbal Fernández (Conferencia de Prensa del Jefe de Gabinete Aníbal Fernández) |date=16 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326214059/http://www.casarosada.gov.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6926 |archivedate=26 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the new restrictions, [[Desire Petroleum]] began drilling for oil on 22 February 2010, about {{convert|100|km|nmi|disp=output only|abbr=off}} (100&amp;nbsp;km, 62&amp;nbsp;mi) north of the Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8527307.stm | title=Drilling for oil begins off the Falkland Islands | work=BBC News | date=22 February 2010 | accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current claims==
{{See also|List of Falkland Islands placenames}}

===Argentina===
The Argentine government argues that it has maintained a claim over the Falkland Islands since 1833, and renewed it as recently as December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1140883 |title=Malvinas: la ONU hará más gestiones para abrir el diálogo |publisher=Lanacion.com.ar |accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers the archipelago part of the [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego Province]], along with [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]].

Supporters of the Argentine position make the following claims:
* That sovereignty of the islands was transferred to Argentina from Spain upon independence in 1810,&lt;ref name="hasani"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://operationkosovo.kentlaw.edu/symposium/resources/hasani-fletcher.htm | title=Uti Possidetis Juris: From Rome To Kosovo | author=Hasani, Enver | journal=Fletcher Forum of World Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; a principle known as ''[[uti possidetis juris]]''.
* That the British dropped their claim by [[acquiescence]] by not protesting the many years of pacific and effective Spanish occupation, after the abandonment of Port Egmont.&lt;ref name="rizzo-romano"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.malvinasonline.com.ar/index.php/derecho-internacional/articulos/100-el-estoppel-y-la-problematica-juridicospolitica-de-las-islas-malvinas.html | title=El estoppel y la problemática jurídicopolítica de las Islas Malvinas | author1=Rizzo Romano | author2=Alfredo H. | journal=La Ley | year=1987 | volume=A | issue=847 | quote=El Reino Unido jamás protestó o efectuó reserva alguna ante la larga, pacífica, efectiva y pública posesión hispana sobre las Islas Malvinas y sus dependencias del Atlántico Sur, durante casi 60 años; plazo mucho mayor que el exigido por tribunales internacionales para adquirir por prescripción.

* That, in addition to ''[[uti possidetis juris]]'', sovereignty was obtained when the islands were formally claimed in Argentina's name in 1820, followed by Argentina's confirmation and effective occupation from 1826 to 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Gustafson, pp. 21–25.

* That the [[Reassertion of British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (1833)|establishment of British ''de facto'' rule on the Falklands]] in 1833 (referred to as an "act of force" by Argentina) was illegal under international law, and this has been noted and protested by Argentina on 17 June 1833 and repeated in 1841, 1849, 1884, 1888, 1908, 1927, 1933, 1946, and yearly thereafter in the UN.&lt;ref&gt;[[:s:es:Protesta diplomática de la Argentina por la ocupación de las Malvinas en 1833|Argentine diplomatic protest for the occupation of the Malvinas in 1833]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gustafson|1998|p=34}}

====The Nootka Sound Conventions====
In 1789, both the United Kingdom and Spain attempted settlement in the [[Nootka Sound]], on [[Vancouver Island]]. On 25 October 1790, these two Kingdoms approved the [[Nootka Convention|Nootka Sound Convention]]. The Conventions included provisions recognising that the coasts and islands of South America colonised by Spain at the time were Spanish, and that areas south of the southernmost settlements were off limits to both countries, provided (in a secret article) that no third party settled there either. The conventions were unilaterally repudiated by Spain in 1795{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} but implicitly revived by the [[Treaty of Madrid (1814)|Treaty of Madrid]] in 1814.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The sixth article of the convention states:&lt;ref name="nootka"&gt;E.O.S Scholefield [http://www.ourroots.ca/e/page.aspx?id=267207 British Columbia from Earliest Times to Present] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095542/http://www.ourroots.ca/e/page.aspx?id=267207 |date=29 September 2007 }}. p. 666&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It is further agreed with respect to the eastern and western coasts of South America and the islands adjacent, that the respective subjects shall not form in the future any establishment on the parts of the coast situated to the south of the parts of the same coast and of the islands adjacent already occupied by Spain; it being understood that the said respective subjects shall retain the liberty of landing on the coasts and islands so situated for objects connected with their fishery and of erecting thereon huts and other temporary structures serving only those objects.}}

Whether or not this affected sovereignty over the islands is disputed. The British argue that the agreement did not affect the respective claims and only stipulated that neither party would make further establishments on the coasts or "adjacent" islands already held by Spain.&lt;ref name="RichardD.Chenette"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Argentine Seizure of the Malvinas &amp;#91;Falkland&amp;#93; Islands: History and Diplomacy|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1987/CRD.htm|accessdate=27 May 2013|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina argues that "the islands adjacent" includes the Falklands and that the UK renounced any claim by the agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Todini |first= Bruno |title= Falkland Islands, History, War and Economics.

====Constitution of Argentina====
The Argentine claim is included in the transitional provisions of the [[Constitution of Argentina]] as [[1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution|amended in 1994]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/interes/constitucion/cuerpo1.php |title=Constitución Nacional |date=22 August 1994 |accessdate=17 June 2011 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040617152239/http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/interes/constitucion/cuerpo1.php |archivedate=17 June 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/interes/constitucion/english.php |title=Constitution of the Argentine Nation |date=22 August 1994 |accessdate=17 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604215413/http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/interes/constitucion/english.php |archivedate=4 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Argentine Nation ratifies its legitimate and non-prescribing sovereignty over the Malvinas, Georgias del Sur and Sandwich del Sur Islands and over the corresponding maritime and insular zones, as they are an integral part of the National territory.

The recovery of these territories and the full exercise of sovereignty, respecting the way of life for its inhabitants and according to the principles of international law, constitute a permanent and unwavering goal of the Argentine people.}}

In addition, Argentina demonstrates its claim to the islands by stating they are part of its [[Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina|Tierra del Fuego Province]].

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Falklands-Police.JPG|thumb|right|The UK exercises both ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' control over the islands]]
In 1964 the Argentine government raised the matter at the [[United Nations]] in a sub-committee of the Special Committee on the situation with regard to the implementation of the UN Declaration of the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. In reply, the British Representative on the committee declared that the British Government held that the question of sovereignty over the islands was "not negotiable". Following a report by the Special Committee, [[UN General Assembly Resolution]] 2065 was passed on 16 December 1965. In its preamble it referred to the UN's "cherished aim to bring colonialism to an end everywhere", and invited both nations to proceed with negotiations to find a peaceful solution bearing in mind "the interests of the population of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)".&lt;ref name="UN2065" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Franks"&gt;{{cite book | title=Falkland Islands Review: Report of a Committee of Privy Counsellors. Chmn.Lord Franks | publisher=Pimlico Books | author=Franks, Lord | year=1992 | isbn=9780712698405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1966 the British Foreign Secretary, Michael Stewart, visited Buenos Aires when the Argentine claim to the islands was raised with him, following which, in July, a preliminary meeting was held in London, where the British delegation "formally rejected" the Argentine Ambassador's suggestion that the UK's occupation of the Islands was illegal.&lt;ref name = "Franks"/&gt;

On 2 December 1980, [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]], Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, stated in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]: "We have no doubt about our sovereignty over the Falkland Islands... we have a perfectly valid title".&lt;ref name = "Franks"/&gt;  The British government regards the right of the islanders to self-determination as "paramount"&lt;ref name = "Franks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.mercopress.com/2010/03/29/falklands-no-return-to-the-80s-tacit-uk-argentine-agreement | title=Falklands: "No return to the 80s", tacit UK/Argentine agreement | publisher=[[MercoPress]] South Atlantic News Agency | date=29 March 2010 | accessdate=4 April 2010 | quote=... as a country and as democrats we believe in self determination, and if the people of the Islands want to remain British, that is their choice and we will always support them”, said [Foreign Office minister Chris] Bryant who insisted that “we have no doubts as to whom the Falklands belong”.

* That the 2013 [[Falkland Islands sovereignty referendum, 2013|referendum]], in which 99.8% of Falklands voters voted to remain a [[British Overseas Territory]] on a 92% turnout, was an exercise in self-determination that "demonstrated beyond all doubt" the islanders' views on the dispute; and that the result should be respected by all other countries including Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21750909 | title=Falklands referendum: Voters choose to remain UK territory | work=BBC News | date=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/mar/12/falkland-islands-referendum-votes-yes | title=Falkland Islands: respect overwhelming 'yes' vote, Cameron tells Argentina | work=The Guardian | date=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/supporting-the-falkland-islanders-right-to-self-determination|title=Falkland Islanders' right to self-determination|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* That the UK both claimed and settled the islands in 1765 before Argentina existed.&lt;ref name="RichardD.Chenette" /&gt;

* That the UK abandoned its settlement in 1774 due to economic pressures, but left a plaque behind proving sovereignty was not relinquished.&lt;ref name="RichardD.Chenette" /&gt;
* That the [[Nootka Sound Convention]] only stipulated against further establishments and did not affect existing claims to sovereignty.&lt;ref name="RichardD.Chenette" /&gt;
* That ''[[uti possidetis juris]]'' "is not a universally accepted principle of international law" and Argentina could not inherit the islands upon independence anyway as Spain did not have ''[[de facto]]'' control since 1811.&lt;ref name="COFFEY"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/mar/2/falklands-are-british-not-argentine/?page=all | title=COFFEY: Falklands are British, not Argentine | work=Washington Times | date=March 2012 | accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Falkland Islands Constitution====
The [[Constitution of the Falkland Islands]], which came into force on 1 January 2009, claims the right to self-determination, specifically mentioning political, economic, cultural, and other matters.&lt;ref name = "Falkland Islands Constitution"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20082846_en_3#sch1-pt1 |title=Chapter 1 of the Falkland Islands Constitution |date=5 November 2008 (came into force on 1 January 2009)|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International and regional views===
Argentina has pursued an aggressive diplomatic agenda, regularly raising the issue and seeking international support. Most [[South America]]n countries have expressed support for the Argentine position and called for negotiations to restart at regional summits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn05602.pdf | title=Argentina and the Falkland Islands | publisher=House of Commons Library | accessdate=22 February 2013 | author=Miller, Vaughne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[People's Republic of China]] has backed Argentina's sovereignty claim, reciprocating Argentina's support of the Chinese claim to [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="diplomaticoffensive"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18424768 | title=Q&amp;A: Argentina's diplomatic offensive on Falklands | work=BBC News | date=14 June 2012 | accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the Republic of China (Taiwan) acknowledges British sovereignty and ignores Argentina's sovereignty claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boca.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=3346&amp;ctNode=753&amp;mp=1 | title=英屬福克蘭群島 Falkland Islands | publisher=Bureau of Consular Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China (Taiwan) | accessdate=26 November 2013|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1964, Argentina has lobbied its case at the [[Special Committee on Decolonization|Decolonization Committee of the UN]], which annually recommends dialogue to resolve the dispute. The [[UN General Assembly]] has passed several resolutions on the issue. In 1988, the General Assembly reiterated a 1965 request that both countries negotiate a peaceful settlement to the dispute and respect the interests of the Falkland Islanders and the principles of UN GA resolution 1514.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/p.willetts/SAC/UN/UN-LIST.HTM | title=United Nations Documents on the Falklands-Malvinas Conflict | publisher=South Atlantic Council | accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In''''' is a best-selling 1981 non-fiction book by [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] and [[William Ury|William L. Ury]]. Subsequent editions in 1991 and 2011 added Bruce Patton as co-author. All of the authors were members of the [[Harvard Negotiation Project]]. The book made appearances for years on the ''[[Business Week]]'' [[bestseller]] list. The book suggests a method called '''principled negotiation''' or "[[negotiation]] of merits".

==Background==
Members of the [[Harvard Negotiation Project]], Fisher and Ury focused on the psychology of negotiation in their method, "principled negotiation", finding acceptable solutions by determining which needs are fixed and which are flexible for negotiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Dance of Negotiation | last = Morrow | first = Lance | date = Dec 7, 1981 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953270-1,00.html | journal = Time | accessdate = 2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1987, the book had been adopted in several U.S. school districts to help students understand "non-adversarial bargaining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Alternatives To adversarial negotiations being used successfully | work = Eugene Register-Guard | date = May 12, 1987 | last = Piele | first = Philip K. |author2=Stuart C.

The book became a perennial best-seller. By July 1998, it had been appearing for more than three years on the ''Business Week'' "Best-Seller" book list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Business Week Best-Seller List |work=Business Week |date=July 6, 1998 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/1998/27/b3585036.htm |accessdate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215040748/http://www.businessweek.com/1998/27/b3585036.htm |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2007, it was still making appearances on the list as one of the "Longest Running Best Sellers" in paperback business books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_49/b4061103.htm |title=The Business Week Best Seller List |work=Business Week |date=December 3, 2007 |accessdate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003024129/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_49/b4061103.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third edition was published in 2011.&lt;ref name="3rd ed"/&gt;

==Method of principled negotiation==
{{Page numbers needed|section|date=May 2017}}
The method of principled negotiation was developed at the Harvard [[Program on Negotiation]] by Fisher, Ury, and Patton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = About the Harvard Negotiation Project | work = Program on Negotiation Harvard Law School | date = April 19, 2009 | url = http://www.pon.harvard.edu/research_projects/harvard-negotiation-project/hnp/ | accessdate = January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to reach agreement without jeopardizing business relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Harvard Principled Negotiation | work = The World of Collaborative Practice | last = Gladel | first = Florence | date = July 1, 2012 | url = http://theworldofcollaborativepractice.com/?p=1305 | accessdate = January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is based on five propositions:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fisher |first1=Roger |last2=Ury |first2=William |last3=Patton |first3=Bruce |date=1991 |origyear=1981 |title=Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=9780140157352 |oclc=24318769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Separate the people from the problem" ===
The first principle of ''Getting to Yes''—"Separate the people from the problem"—applies to the interaction between the two parties to a negotiation. The principle is broken down into three subcategories: perception, emotion, and communication. The authors point out that negotiators are people first—people who have values, cultural backgrounds, and emotions that vary by person.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Getting to Yes'' teaches that this human aspect can be either helpful or disastrous. Negotiation can either build trust and understanding with a positive relationship established at the end, or lead to frustration or dissatisfaction. The authors discuss how the relationship between parties tends to become entangled with the problem that the parties are discussing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Incorrectly deducing the intentions of the other party based on one's own fear is a common mistake; the authors describe it as a bad habit that could cost "fresh ideas in the direction of agreement".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The authors explain that feelings are just as important as the content of the dispute during negotiation. Communication is the main aspect of negotiating, and the authors point out three common problems in communication:
# Not clearly speaking with the other party, but instead attempting to impress those within one's constituency by taking a side instead of working toward a mutual agreement;
# Not actively listening to the other party, but instead only listening to rebut the other party's statements;
# Misunderstanding or misinterpreting what the other party has said.

Similarly, in the book, ''I Win You Win'', Carl Lyons explored the principle of "separating the person from the problem" and discovered that interests are an extension of values. People's current interests are always attempting to satisfy something that they value. Understanding this principle is a key first step in understanding people's behavior in negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=I win, you win: the essential guide to principled negotiation|last=Lyons|first=Carl|publisher=London : A &amp; C Black|year=2007|isbn=|location=9781408101902|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Focus on interests, not positions" ===
The second principle—"Focus on interests, not positions"—is about the position that the parties hold and the interests that led them to that position. The authors recommend that negotiators should focus on the interests behind the position that each party holds. Both parties should discuss their interests and keep an open mind to the other side of the argument.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is crucial to put yourself in the shoes of the other side to try to understand "why" the other side is acting the way they are or rather "why they are not".&lt;ref name="3rd ed"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fisher |first1=Roger |last2=Ury |first2=William |last3=Patton |first3=Bruce |date=2011 |origyear=1981 |title=Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=9780143118756 |oclc=609540048}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} The authors state that "the most powerful interests are basic human needs".&lt;ref name="3rd ed"/&gt;{{rp|50}}

=== "Invent options for mutual gain" ===
The third principle—"Invent options for mutual gain"—is about benefiting both parties that are doing business. This principle aims to help the parties find an option that will impact each party in a positive way, making both sides feel like they did not get taken advantage of during the negotiation. It is important to listen to the other party and not make a decision until both parties feel that they have been heard. Both parties should clearly explain their intentions and what they want out of the conversation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== "Insist on using objective criteria" ===
The fourth principle—"Insist on using objective criteria"—is about making sure that the conversation stays on topic and that it is productive. The parties are making deals based on objective and practical criteria. The three steps to using objective criteria are to find out what the other party's intentions are, keep an open mind, and never give in to pressure or threats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each party is in charge of keeping the other party committed to the conversation.

=== "Know your BATNA" ===
The fifth principle—"Know your [[Best alternative to a negotiated agreement|BATNA]] (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)"—emphasizes that no method can guarantee success if all the leverage lies on the other side.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The authors suggest two methods of going about negotiating from a position of power. First, each party should protect themselves first. Second, each party should make the most of the power within their own assets to negotiate and win against the opposite party.

When negotiating, the parties must resist the urge to constantly compromise for fear of completely losing the negotiation. Such compromises may allow for a shorter negotiation, but may also leave the primary party with a deal that didn't benefit them to the full extent. Establishing a "bottom line" can protect the negotiator's final offer, but may limit the ability to learn from the negotiation itself and may preclude further negotiation that possibly could result in a better advantage for all parties involved. When considering final decisions, each party may want to take a step back and consider all possible alternatives to the current offer being made. One example in the book describes a house on the market: Thinking of all other possibilities if the house were not sold should be compared with the option of selling the house to ensure the best decision is made.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Principled negotiation in action==
The article "Taking steps toward 'Getting to Yes' at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida" highlights principled negotiation in practice by a major insurance company.&lt;ref name="BCBS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Booth |first1=Bridget |last2=McCredie |first2=Matt |date=August 2004 |title=Taking steps toward "Getting to Yes" at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida |journal=The Academy of Management Executive |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=109–112 |doi=10.5465/AME.2004.14776178 |url=http://amp.aom.org/content/18/3/109 |publisher=[[Academy of Management]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield]]—aware of increasing competition, rising healthcare prices, and increased customer expectations—sought to highlight other parties' interests when creating policies so as not to drive away business.&lt;ref name="BCBS"/&gt; The authors noted that applying principled negotiation techniques came much more naturally at the executive level and needed more practice at lower levels of management.&lt;ref name="BCBS"/&gt;

==Criticism==
[[James J. White]], a professor of law at the [[University of Michigan]], suggested that ''Getting to Yes'' is not scholarly or analytical and relies on anecdotal evidence, and that "the authors seem to deny the existence of a significant part of the negotiation process, and to oversimplify or explain away many of the most troublesome problems inherent in the art and practice of negotiation".&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite journal |last=White |first=James J. |authorlink=James J. White |date=1984 |title=Review: The Pros and Cons of "Getting to YES": Getting to YES by Roger Fisher, William Ury |journal=Journal of Legal Education |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=115–124 |url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/reviews/82/ |jstor=42897936}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no quantitative evidence presented that suggests outcomes using this technique will typically be better than an alternative method, such as positional bargaining.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8064">'''Great Father''' and '''Great Mother''' were titles used by [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial powers in North America]] during the 19th century to refer to the [[President of the United States]], the [[Monarch of Canada]], the [[King of Spain]], or the [[King of France]] during interactions with indigenous peoples. Contrary to depictions in popular culture, there are no recorded instances of the terms "'''Great White Father'''" being used to refer to the U.S. president. The addition of the word "white" may have entered popular lexicon via [[dime store novel|western adventure novels]].&lt;ref name="delegation"&gt;{{cite book |last=Viola |first=Herman |date=2004 |title=Diplomats in Buckskins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FeGEhXY-4aEC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94 |location= |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press Press |pages=94–95 |isbn=0806199350 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Great Father Andrew Jackson (1835).png|thumb|left|upright|A lithograph, circa 1835, shows Andrew Jackson as the "Great Father" caring for Native Americans, who are depicted as children.]]
[[First Nations]] peoples and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] most often organized themselves by clan and family; ties of kinship were considered central to intertribal relations and the understanding of tribal political power. In the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], for instance, the relations between individual bands were metaphorically described using paternal (parent to child), or fraternal (sibling to sibling) terms to indicate the importance of two groups in relation to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=James |date=2004 |title=Reflections on Native-newcomer Relations: Selected Essays |url= |location= |publisher=University of Toronto Press |pages=205–208 |isbn=0802086691 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this context, and to make themselves better understood during treaty negotiations, British representatives often referred to [[Jehovah]] (aka God or the Lord)  as "the Great Father" (see: [[Great Spirit]]). 

It was also possible to refer to the British monarchs [[King George III]] and [[Queen Victoria]] as "the Great Father" and "the '''Great White Mother'''" respectively, and to the native people as his or her "Red Children." [[David Laird]] invoked the phrase while explaining [[Treaty 7]] to the [[Blackfoot]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/treaties-from-1760-1923-two-sides-to-the-story-1.1081839 |title=Treaties from 1760 - 1923: Two sides to the story|last1=Montpetit  |first1=Isabelle  |last2= |first2= |date=26 May 2011 |website=cbc.ca |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|"The Great Spirit has made all things—the sun, the moon, and the stars, the earth, the forest, and the swift running rivers. It is by the Great Spirit that the Queen rules over this great country and other great countries. The Great Spirit has made the white man and the red man brothers, and we should take each other by the hand. The Great Mother loves all her children, white man and red man alike; she wishes to do them all good."}}

The anthropologist [[Raymond DeMallie]] has explained that - due to the nature of Native American society - the use of kinship terms such as "Great Father" and "Great Mother" was a cunning diplomatic tactic, and not an assertion of Native inferiority. In many cases the representatives who negotiated treaties on behalf of the "Great Father" referred to themselves as the "brothers" of indigenous peoples; among some tribes it was a grave offense to refuse anything to a brother.&lt;ref&gt;
    {{cite web |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/48/greatmother.shtml |title="Your Great Mother Across the Salt Sea": Prairie First Nations, the British Monarchy and the Vice Regal Connection to 1900 |last1=Carter |first1=Sarah |last2= |first2= |date=2004 |website=mhs.mb.ca |publisher=Manitoba Historical Society |accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the primacy of the Great Father was promoted through elaborate displays of military pageantry, the use of mystical language to describe the far-removed President, and the distribution of "[[Indian Peace Medal|peace medals]]" bearing the portrait of the sitting head of state (giving gifts, such as peace medals, further reinforced the paternal nature of the relationship as gift giving, in many Native cultures, was typically reserved for parent-child interaction). As in Canada, Native peoples were referred to as the "children" of the Great Father; so intense was the myth created surrounding him that chiefs brought to [[Washington, D.C.]] to meet the President often manifested symptoms of terror prior to an audience. [[Lean Bear]], upon being presented to [[Abraham Lincoln]] at the [[White House]], reportedly found himself suddenly unable to speak. [[Winnebago tribe|Winnebago]] chief Hoowaneka recalled his audience with [[John Quincy Adams]] by explaining "I thought I was in heaven, and the old man there, I thought was the Great Spirit."&lt;ref name="delegation" /&gt;
[[File:Jefferson peace medal dies.jpg|thumb|The profile of Thomas Jefferson is featured on an 1801 peace medal.]]
An example of an invocation of the term "Great Father" by an American official can be found in a decree given by [[Thomas L. McKenney]] to the [[Menominee]], in which McKenney declares he has received instructions from the Great Father to appoint a penultimate chief with whom the United States could negotiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Prucha |first=Francis |date=1995 |title=The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSeWGTYsFcsC&amp; |location= |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |page=263 |isbn=0803287348 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|"Your Great Father, who lives in [[Washington, D.C.|the Great Village]] towards the rising sun, has heard confused sounds from the lands where his Menominee children hunt. He thinks it is because there are too many mouths here and that all speak at once.

On occasions when territory would pass from one colonial power to another, the new power might refer to the former Great Father in past-tense, as when [[William Henry Harrison]] addressed the [[Shawnee]], declaring that "my children, let us look back to times that are past.

'''Herostratus''' ({{lang-grc|Ἡρόστρατος}}) was a 4th-century BC Greek [[arsonist]], who sought notoriety by destroying the [[Temple of Artemis]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. His acts prompted the creation of a ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' law, forbidding anyone to mention his name. The law was ultimately ineffective, as evidenced by mentions of his existence in contemporary literature. Thus, Herostratus has become a [[metonym]] for someone who commits a criminal act in order to become noted.

== History ==
[[File:Miniaturk 009.jpg|thumb|300px|A modern model of the [[Temple of Artemis]].]]

Archeological evidence indicates the site of the [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus]] had been of sacred use since the [[Bronze Age]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anton |last=Bammer |title=A [[Peripteros]] of the Geometric Period in the Artemision of Ephesus |journal=Anatolian Studies |volume=40 |year=1990 |issue= &lt;!--|pages=137–160--&gt; |doi=10.2307/3642799 |jstor=3642799 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the original building was destroyed during a flood in the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 7.7 - 8.&lt;/ref&gt; A second temple was commissioned by King [[Croesus]] of [[Lydia]] around 560 BC and built by Cretan architects including [[Chersiphron]], constructed largely of [[marble]], and measuring 337 feet long and 180 feet wide with its pillars standing 40 feet tall.&lt;ref name="Wurtz"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Wurtz II|title=Love in Crisis: Modern Parallels to the Church at Ephesus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEqACgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT6|date=2015|publisher=Creation House|asin=B014C54MU2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpted bases of the pillars contained life-sized carvings and the roof opened to the sky around a statue of [[Artemis]].&lt;ref name="Wurtz"/&gt; The second temple was included on an early list of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]] by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC, and was well known in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rawlinson |first=George |year=1859 |title=The History of Herodotus |volume=1 |publisher=D. Appleton and Company |location=New York |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the life of Herostratus, though it is thought he may have been someone of low social standing, a non-[[Ephesian]] or a [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slave]].&lt;ref name="kidder"&gt;{{cite book|authors=David S. Kidder &amp; Noah D.

However, the ancient historian [[Theopompus]] mentions the name of Herostratus in his ''[[Philippica (Theopompus)|Philippica]]'',&lt;ref name="Borowitz2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert Borowitz|title=Terrorism for Self-glorification: The Herostratos Syndrome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWiTYTJXY_IC&amp;pg=PA6|date=January 2005|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=978-0-87338-818-4|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it appears again later in the works of [[Strabo]].&lt;ref name="Amaseia2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Strabo of Amaseia|title=Delphi Complete Works of Strabo - Geography (Illustrated)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DFqQCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT4279|date=13 February 2016|publisher=Delphi Classics|isbn=978-1-78656-368-2|pages=4279–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that in fact his name has outlived the names of his judges, and in his ''Hydriotaphia'' Sir [[Thomas Browne]] said: &lt;blockquote&gt;But the iniquity of oblivion blindly scattereth her poppy, and deals with the memory of men without distinction to merit of perpetuity... Herostratus lives that burnt the Temple of Diana, he is almost lost that built it... Who knows whether the best of men be known? or whether there be not more remarkable persons forgot, than any that stand remembred in the known account of time?&lt;ref&gt;The Works of Sir Thomas Browne Volume III p. 139. Pub: Edinburgh John Grant 1907 https://archive.org/details/cu31924064959640&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Work on a third temple at the site began in 323 BC, resulting in a larger and more ornate temple that would be included by [[Antipater of Sidon]] as one of [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

==Legacy==
Herostratus's name lived on in classical literature and has passed into modern languages as a term for someone who commits a criminal act in order to achieve notoriety, thus winning herostratic fame.

===In language===
The term "Herostratic fame" refers to Herostratus and means "fame [sought] at any cost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lqvCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33|title=Spectacular Disappearances: Celebrity and Privacy, 1696–1801|first=Julia H. |last=Fawcett |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2016 |ISBN=9780472119806 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Many authors from [[Spanish literature|sixteenth and seventeenth-century Spain]] refer to Herostratus to represent someone who will do anything to gain notoriety. He is discussed in Chapter 8 of the second part of [[Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1615), along with [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Hernán Cortés]] among others. Don García, the protagonist of [[Ruiz de Alarcón]]'s ''La verdad sospechosa'' (''Suspect Truth''), compares his feats to the ancient character.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick A. de Armas]], "The Burning at Ephesus: Cervantes and Alarcón's ''La verdad sospechosa''," ''Studies in Honor of Gilbert Paolini'', ed.

*[[Jaroslav Hašek]] in the preface of his last novel, ''[[The Good Soldier Švejk]]'', compared Herostratus to Švejk (the protagonist) and praised the latter.
* In his 6 October 1939 speech to the Berlin Reichstag, Adolf Hitler made a reference to Herostratus making a contemporary comparison: ''“it is clear to me that there is a certain Jewish international capitalism and journalism that has no feeling at all in common with the people whose interests they pretend to represent, but who, like Herostratus of old, regard incendiarism as the greatest success of their lives.”''&lt;ref&gt;http://pastdaily.com/2014/10/06/adolf-hitler-addresses-the-reichstag-october-6-1939-past-daily-reference-room/&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[Gore Vidal]]'s 1970 novel [[Two Sisters (novel)|''Two Sisters'']] the real-life story of Herostratus appears as a sub-plot.
* In [[Grigori Gorin]]'s 1972 play [[:ru:Забыть Герострата! (пьеса)|''Forget the Herostratus!'']] in which a "theater man" from the present observes the judgement of Herostratus in order to understand the source of the disaster that plagues humanity.
* [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s short story [[The Wall (short story collection)#"Erostratus"|"Erostratus"]] is directly based on the story of Herostratus.

Between 1950 and 1960, the [[Emperor of Ethiopia|imperial government]] of [[Ethiopia]] enacted legislation and implemented a new policy to encourage foreign investment in the [[Economy of Ethiopia|Ethiopian economy]]. This new policy provided investor benefits in the form of [[tax exemption]]s, remittances of foreign exchange, import and export duty relief, tax exemptions on [[dividend]]s, and the provision of financing through the [[Ethiopian Investment Corporation]] and the [[Development Bank of Ethiopia]]. In addition, the government guaranteed protection to industrial enterprises by instituting high [[tariff]]s and by banning the importation of [[commodities]] that might adversely affect production of domestic goods. Protected items included sugar, textiles, furniture, and metal. The government also participated through direct investment in enterprises that had high capital costs, such as oil refineries and the paper and pulp, glass and bottle, tire, and cement industries. In 1963, with the Second [[Five-year plans of Ethiopia|Five-Year Plan]] under way, the government enacted Proclamation No. 51. The proclamation's objective was to consolidate other investment policies enacted up to that period, to extend benefits to Ethiopian investors (previous legislation had limited the benefits to foreigners only), and to create an Investment Committee that would oversee investment programs. In 1966 the Ethiopian government enacted Proclamation No. 242, which elevated the Investment Committee's status as an advisory council to that of an authorized body empowered to make independent investment decisions. Thus, by the early 1970s, Ethiopia's [[industrialization]] policy included a range of fiscal incentives, direct government investment, and equity participation in private enterprises.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Wubne, Mulatu. "Agriculture". ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ettoc.html A Country Study: Ethiopia]'' (Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, editors). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (1991). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's policy attracted considerable foreign investment to the industrial sector. For instance, in 1971/72 the share of foreign capital in manufacturing industries amounted to 41 percent of the total paid-up capital. Many foreign enterprises operated as private limited companies, usually as a branch or subsidiary of multinational corporations. The Dutch had a major investment (close to 80 percent) in the sugar industry. [[Ethiopia-Italy relations|Italian]] and [[Ethiopia-Japan relations|Japanese]] investors participated in textiles; and [[Ethiopian-Greek relations|Greeks]] maintained an interest in shoes and beverages. Italian investors also worked in building, construction, and agricultural industries.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

== Under the Derg ==
In 1975 the [[Derg]] nationalized most industries and subsequently reorganized them into state-owned corporations. On February 7, 1975, the government released a document outlining Ethiopia's new economic policy, which was explicitly [[socialist]] in philosophy and intent. The policy identified three manufacturing areas slated for state involvement: basic industries that produced goods serving other industries and that had the capacity to create linkages in the economy; industries that produced essential goods for the general population; and industries that made drugs, medicine, tobacco, and beverages. The policy also grouped areas of the public and private sectors into activities reserved for the state, activities where state and private capital could operate jointly, and activities left to the private sector.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The 1975 nationalization of major industries scared off foreign private investment. Private direct investment, according to the [[National Bank of Ethiopia]], declined from 65 million [[Ethiopian Birr|birr]] in 1974 to 12 million in 1977. As compensation negotiations between the Ethiopian government and foreign nationals dragged on, foreign investment virtually ceased. The United States Congress invoked the [[Bourke B. Hickenlooper|Hickenlooper Amendment]], which had the effect of prohibiting the use of United States funds for development purposes until Ethiopia had settled compensation issues with United States nationals. During 1982 and 1983, the Ethiopian government settled claims made by Italian, Dutch, Japanese, and [[Ethiopia-United Kingdom relations|British]] nationals. Negotiation to settle compensation claims by [[Ethiopia-United States relations|United States nationals]] continued until 1985, when Ethiopia agreed to pay about US$ 7 million in installments to compensate United States companies.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Issued in 1983, the Derg's Proclamation No. 235 (the Joint Venture Proclamation) signaled Ethiopia's renewed interest in attracting foreign capital. The proclamation offered incentives such as a five-year period of income tax relief for new projects, import and export duty relief, tariff protection, and repatriation of profits and capital. It limited foreign holdings to a maximum of 49 percent and the duration of any joint venture to twenty-five years. Although the proclamation protected investors' interests from expropriation, the government reserved the right to purchase all shares in a joint venture "for reasons of national interest." The proclamation failed to attract foreign investment, largely because foreign businesses were hesitant to invest in a country whose government recently had nationalized foreign industries without a level of compensation these businesses considered satisfactory.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

In 1989 the government issued Special Decree No. 11, a revision of the 1983 proclamation. The decree allowed majority foreign ownership in many sectors, except in those related to public utilities, banking and finance, trade, transportation, and communications, where joint ventures were not allowed. The decree also removed all restrictions on profit repatriation and attempted to provide more extensive legal protection of investors than had the 1983 proclamation.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

President [[Haile Mariam Mengistu]]'s March 1990 speech to the Central Committee of the [[Worker's Party of Ethiopia]] was a turning point in Ethiopia's recent economic history. Acknowledging that socialism had failed, Mengistu proposed implementing a [[mixed economy]]. Under the new system, the private sector would be able to participate in all parts of the economy with no limit on capital investment (Ethiopia had a US$ 250,000 ceiling on private investment); developers would be allowed to build houses, apartments, and office buildings for rent or sale; and commercial enterprises would be permitted to develop industries, hotels, and a range of other enterprises on government-owned land to be leased on a concessionary basis. Additionally, state-owned industries and businesses would be required to operate on a profit basis, with those continuing to lose money to be sold or closed. Farmers would receive legal ownership of land they tilled and the right to sell their produce in a free market. Whereas there were many areas yet to be addressed, such as privatization of state enterprises and compensation for citizens whose land and property had been confiscated, these proposals generated optimism among some economists about Ethiopia's economic future. However, some observers pointed out that Mengistu's proposals only amounted to recognition of existing practices in the [[underground economy]].&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

'''Iron(II) gluconate''', or '''ferrous gluconate''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci-toys.com/ingredients/ferrous_gluconate.html SciToys.com ferrous gluconate information page]&lt;/ref&gt; is a black compound often used as an iron supplement. It is the iron(II) salt of [[gluconic acid]].  It is marketed under brand names such as ''Fergon'', ''Ferralet'' and ''Simron''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drugs.com/MTM/ferrous_gluconate.html Drugs.com ferrous gluconate summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
===Medical===
{{Main|Iron supplement}}
Ferrous gluconate is effectively used in the treatment of [[hypochromic anemia]]. The use of this compound compared with other [[iron]] preparations results in satisfactory [[reticulocyte]] responses, a high percentage utilization of iron, and daily increase in [[hemoglobin]] that a normal level occurs in a reasonably short time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1172/JCI100881 | title=The Use of Ferrous Gluconate in the Treatment of Hypochromic Anemia | year=1937 | last1=Reznikoff | first1=Paul | last2=Goebel | first2=Walther F. | journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume=16 | issue=4 | pages=547–54 | pmid=16694502 | pmc=424894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food additive===
Ferrous gluconate is also used as a [[food additive]] when processing black [[olive]]s. It is represented by the food labeling [[E number]] E579 in Europe. It imparts a uniform jet black color to the olives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cspinet.org/reports/chemcuisine.htm CSPI's Guide to Food Additives]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, regular consumption of blackened olives may help to keep a healthy [[ferritin]] level in the [[blood]].

== Toxicity ==
Ferrous gluconate may be toxic in case of overdose. Children may show signs of toxicity with ingestions of 10–20&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of elemental iron. Serious toxicity may result from ingestions of more than 60&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. Iron exerts both local and systemic effects: it is corrosive to the gastrointestinal [[mucosa]], it can have a negative impact on the heart and blood ([[dehydration]], low [[blood pressure]], fast and weak pulse, [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]), lungs, liver, gastrointestinal system (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting blood), nervous system (chills, dizziness, [[coma]], convulsions, headache), and skin (flushing, loss of color, bluish-colored lips and fingernails).&lt;ref&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1011689-overview Toxicity, Iron]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002659.htm Iron overdose]&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms may disappear in a few hours, but then emerge again after 1 or more days. {{source needed|date=February 2016}}

[[File:Entrance to Kelvedon Hatch Nuclear Bunker.jpg|right|thumb|The bungalow that serves as the entrance to the Kelvedon Hatch Nuclear Bunker]]
The '''Kelvedon Hatch Secret Nuclear Bunker''' at [[Kelvedon Hatch]], in the [[Borough of Brentwood]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Essex]], is a large underground bunker maintained during the [[cold war]] as a potential regional government headquarters. Since being decommissioned in 1992, the bunker has been open to the public as a tourist attraction, with a museum focusing on its cold war history.

==Building and intended purpose==
The bunker was first built as an air defence station (an 'R4' Sector Operations Control or SOC) as part of the RAF [[ROTOR]] air defence project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cocroft|first1=Wayne|last2=Thomas|first2=Roger J. C, |title=Cold War: Building for Nuclear Confrontation 1946—1989|year=2003|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|location=Swindon, England|isbn=978-1-873592-81-6|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the demise of the ROTOR SOC the remaining Nuclear Reporting Cell and UKWMO elements were incorporated into a Home Office 'Regional Seat of Government' or RSG. The bunker was able to hold various numbers (in the hundreds) of military and civilian personnel, the numbers changing over the years as the role of the building changed from SOC to RSG and in its later years; 'Regional Government Headquarters' or RGHQ. In the event of a nuclear strike the RSG / RGHQs etc. would be tasked to organise the survival of the population and continue government operations.

==History==
The Kelvedon Hatch bunker was built in 1952&amp;ndash;53 as part of [[ROTOR]]. ROTOR was a programme to improve and harden Britain's air defence network. It was constructed by Peter Lind &amp; Company of London who still trade today. The bunker was a hardened (three level 'R4') Sector Operations Centre (SOC) for RAF Fighter Command. It was to provide command and control of the London Sector of Fighter Command. 

During the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and early into the 1990s, the UK government (Home Office) maintained the bunker as an emergency regional government defence site. Eventually in the early 1990s when nuclear threat was seen as diminished, the bunker was sold back to the farming family who had owned the land in the 1950s. It is now a Cold War museum and retains many of its original ROTOR and RSG/RGHQ features.

==Inside the bunker==
[[File:Nuclear Bunker (20).jpg|thumb|right|Inside the bunker]]
The bunker is built {{convert|125|ft|m|0}} underground and the entrance is through an ordinary looking [[bungalow]] (a standard ROTOR 'Guard House') set amongst trees. The inside of the bungalow leads to a {{convert|100|yd|m|0}} tunnel entering the R4 at its lowest floor (of three). Above are two more floors, the 'hill' which covers it, and a radio mast.

The bunker was able to accommodate some hundreds of personnel (the numbers changing as function and form varied over the years) and could sustain them for up to three months. The bunker has air conditioning and heating (using the original ROTOR AC-Plant but replacing the original coolant with a more 'modern' type [c.1980s]), its own water supply (mains water and its own deep bore hole) and generators, and was equipped with many types of radio equipment, protected ([[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]]) telecommunications, teleprinter (MSX) networks and various military systems: MOULD (system to provide communications between Regular Army, TA Battalions and the Army District and Regional Headquarters) and CONRAD (radio government communications systems post nuclear strike) etc.

==Modern times==
By 1992 the bunker was no longer required, so was decommissioned and the land was sold back to the original owners. It has now been renovated and made into a museum and tourist attraction; many locals appreciate the irony of the many brown tourist road signs in the area, clearly directing people to the "Secret Nuclear Bunker".  The [[BBC]] TV show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' featured the signs.&lt;ref name="topgear"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/halfbyte/2671279410/|title=Top Gear S11E04: Shh! Secret Nuclear Bunker ahead!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bunker was used as a "Killer's Location" for ''[[The Murder Game (TV series)|The Murder Game]]''. Both the living quarters and the operational zone were set up for the "Killer's Game" in the finale. It also played a significant role in an episode of ''[[New Tricks]]'' titled "The Queen's Speech", first broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC1]] on 20 October 2014.

In 2010 the independent British post-apocalyptic/horror film ''S.N.U.B!'' was filmed in the bunker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182942/|title=S.N.U.B!|date=24 May 2010|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 [[FMV game|full-motion video game]] ''[[The Bunker (video game)|The Bunker]]'', which uses live-action footage, was fully filmed inside the bunker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-08-08-the-bunker-proves-theres-plenty-of-life-in-live-action-games|title=The Bunker proves there's plenty of life in the live action genre|first=Martin|last=Robinson|date=8 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;During [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] annexed territory or established [[reichskommissariat]]s which extended [[Paragraph 175|Germany's laws against same-sex sexual activity]] to those territories and reichskommissariats. Same-sex sexual activity was previously legalized in the following countries or territories before German annexation or establishment of reichskommissariats: [[Bas-Rhin]] ([[LGBT rights in France|legal in 1791]]), [[Belgium]] ([[LGBT rights in Belgium|legal in 1795]]), [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]] ([[LGBT rights in Italy|legal in 1890]]), [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] ([[LGBT rights in Italy|legal in 1890]]), [[Haut-Rhin]] ([[LGBT rights in France|legal in 1791]]), [[Luxembourg]] ([[LGBT rights in Luxembourg|legal in 1795]]), [[Moselle]] ([[LGBT rights in France|legal in 1791]]), [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] ([[LGBT rights in the Netherlands|legal in 1811]]), [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] ([[LGBT rights in France|legal in 1791]]), [[Pas-de-Calais]] ([[LGBT rights in France|legal in 1791]]), [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] ([[LGBT rights in Poland|legal in 1932]]), and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]] ([[LGBT rights in Italy|legal in 1890]]). All countries and territories listed that where annexed or established into reichskommissariats by Nazi Germany during World War II where restored as independent countries or reincorporated into their previous countries during or after the war and thus re-legalized same-sex sexual activity in those areas.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;In May 1973, the [[Libyan Arab Republic]] annexed the [[Aouzou Strip]] from [[Chad]]. Libya's laws against same-sex sexual activity where thus extended to the annexed Aouzou Strip. In August 1987, during the [[Toyota War]] between the [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] and Chad, Aouzou fell to the Chadian forces, only to be repelled by an overwhelming Libyan counter-offensive. The Aouzou dispute was concluded on February 3, 1994, when the judges of the [[International Court of Justice]] by a majority of 16 to 1 decided that the Aouzou Strip belonged to Chad. Monitored by international observers, the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Strip began on April 15, 1994, and was completed by May 10, 1994. The formal and final transfer of the Aouzou Strip from Libya to Chad took place on May 30, 1994, when the sides signed a joint declaration stating that the Libyan withdrawal had been effected.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Same-sex sexual activity was never criminalized in the following countries and territories: [[LGBT rights in Benin|Benin]], [[LGBT rights in Burkina Faso|Burkina Faso]], [[LGBT rights in Cambodia|Cambodia]] [[LGBT rights in the Central African Republic|Central African Republic]], [[LGBT rights in Chad|Chad]] (excluding [[Aouzou Strip]]), [[LGBT rights in France|Clipperton Island]], [[LGBT rights in the Republic of the Congo|Republic of the Congo]], [[LGBT rights in Côte d'Ivoire|Côte d'Ivoire]], [[LGBT rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[LGBT rights in France|French Polynesia]], [[LGBT rights in France|French Southern and Antarctic Lands]], [[LGBT rights in Gabon|Gabon]], [[LGBT rights in Laos|Laos]], [[LGBT rights in Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[LGBT rights in Mali|Mali]], [[LGBT rights in France|Mayotte]], [[LGBT rights in France|New Caledonia]], [[LGBT rights in Niger|Niger]], [[LGBT rights in North Korea|North Korea]], [[LGBT rights in Rwanda|Rwanda]], [[LGBT rights in South Korea|South Korea]], [[LGBT rights in Vietnam|Vietnam]], and [[LGBT rights in France|Wallis and Futuna]]. Same-sex sexual activity had also never been criminalized in continent of [[Antarctica]].]]

During the Portuguese colonization of Brazil, homosexuality was illegal in the country between 1533 and 1830, due to the imposition of the Portuguese Penal Code, which was influenced by the British [[Buggery Act 1533]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pensamentorevolucionario.blogspot.com/2009/10/legislacao-mundial-sobre.html British Buggery Act 1533 and Portuguese Penal Code 1533 {{pt icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, eight years after the end of the Portuguese domain, sodomy laws were eliminated from the new Penal Code of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cadastronacionalmedico.org/noticia/136-A-legislacao-sobre-a-homossexuais-bissexuais-transgeneros-transexuais-e-travestis-.htm The Penal Code and the Homosexuality {{pt icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729084320/http://www.cadastronacionalmedico.org/noticia/136-A-legislacao-sobre-a-homossexuais-bissexuais-transgeneros-transexuais-e-travestis-.htm |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[French overseas territories]] located in the [[Americas]], Brazil was the first country in the [[New World]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]] to legalize [[homosexuality]]. Today in [[South America]] only [[Guyana]], a former [[British Empire|British colony]], considers homosexuality illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbianactivism/f/IllegalGaySex.htm In South America only Guyana is anti-homosexual {{en icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1985 the Federal Council of Medicine of Brazil does not consider homosexuality as [[deviant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gph.org.br/faq.asp Homosexuality is not a deviant - Federal Council of Medicine of Brazil {{pt icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706161114/http://www.gph.org.br/faq.asp |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the Federal Council of [[Psychology]] published a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] that has standardized the conduct of [[psychologist]]s face the question: "... psychologists did not collaborate with events or services proposing treatment and cure of homosexuality." In 1990, five years after Brazil removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses, the General Assembly of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), with headquarters in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], removed the homosexuality, in the [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia182/2010/05/16/brasil,i=192631/HA+20+ANOS+A+OMS+TIROU+A+HOMOSSEXUALIDADE+DA+RELACAO+DE+DOENCAS+MENTAIS.shtml Homosexuality is not a deviant - Federal Council of Psychologists of Brazil {{pt icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9021">This is a list of [[pamphlet war]]s in history. For several centuries after the printing press became common, people would print their own ideas in small pamphlets somewhat akin to modern blogs:&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=908631 The Blogosphere and the New Pamphleteers]&lt;/ref&gt; while these could not be widely available via the internet they could "go viral",&lt;ref name=paxton&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/704339 The Paxton Pamphlet War as a Viral Media Event]&lt;/ref&gt; because others were free to reprint pamphlets they liked, and therefore ideas were widely spread.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2011/12/17/how-luther-went-viral How Luther went viral]&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-arguments would then be printed in opposing pamphlets, which might become popular themselves. A prolonged debate carried out this way changed society many times, until copyright laws effectively banned the propagation of ideas in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4508972?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents The Myth of Copyright at Common Law]&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=November 2018}}

* 1517 — The [[Protestant Revolution]] — [[Martin Luther]]'s [[95 Theses]] is simply the most famous salvo in a prolonged pamphlet war that ended up triggering the secession of much of Europe from the Catholic Church (and later reform of that organization), after similar efforts had failed in the past without the printing press to support them.{{cn|date=November 2018}}
* 1640 — [[Bishops' Wars]] — [[John Milton]] participated in [[Milton's antiprelatical tracts|antiprelatical]] pamphlet wars, opposing the policies of [[William Laud]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Elizabeth. "Early Political Prose" in ''A Companion to Milton''. Ed. Thomas Corns. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2003. p. 265–275&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1642 — The [[English Civil War]] — Much of the buildup to the actual civil war was driven by an extensive, often heated, debate via pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collation.folger.edu/2018/06/pamphlet-war-in-england-1641-1643/ A Pamphlet War in England, 1641-1643]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1654 — The Nature of [[Free Will]] — [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Bramhall]] engaged in an intense debate over the nature of free will in humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gpc4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%22a+pamphlet+war+between+bramhall+and+hobbes+ensued The Well-ordered Universe: The Philosophy of Margaret Cavendish]&lt;br/&gt;"William Cavendish invited Hobbes and Bishop Bramhall to his home to discuss human freedom, and, at his request, Bramhall and Hobbes both later wrote down their views. Hobbes' manuscript was translated into French, and, years later, in 1654, the translator published Hobbes' original manuscript without his permission. A pamphlet war between Bramhall and Hobbes ensued."&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1655 — [[Resettlement of the Jews in England]] — The legalization of the open practice of Judaism in England resulted in a pamphlet war, which because of its civil and abstract nature is sometimes credited as preventing the growth of antisemitism during the debate. This featured [[Puritan]] [[William Prynne]] writing in opposition and [[Margaret Fell]], a founder of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) in support of liberalization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/17century/topic_4/debate.htm The Debate over the Resettlement of Jews in England, 1655–56]&lt;br/&gt;In the years 1655–56, the controversy over the readmission of Jews was fought out in a pamphlet war. The issue divided religious radicals from each another as well as from more conservative members of society. William Prynne was vehemently opposed to permitting Jews to return, the Quaker Margaret Fell no less passionately in favor.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1680 — The [[Popish Plot]] — An invented controversy used to drum up anti-Catholic hysteria in England and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Henrietta Heald |title= Chronicle of Britain: Incorporating a Chronicle of Ireland |publisher= Jacques Legrand |year= 1992 |page= 605 |isbn= 9781872031354 |ref= {{Harvid|Heald|1992}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1688 — The [[Socinian controversy]] — A debate on [[christology]] by [[Church of England]] theologians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/reasonableness-of-christianity-gilbert-burnet-and-the-trinitarian-controversy-of-the-1690s/F51E000F56E9AE6E6F5649A232D537F3 The Reasonableness of Christianity? Gilbert Burnet and the Trinitarian Controversy of the 1690s]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] was a notable participant.
* 1697 — Nonconformity — [[Daniel Defoe]] was eventually imprisoned by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] as a [[nonconformist]] who had advocated for her predecessor, [[William III of England|William III]] during a pamphlet war over his policies, including the arguably illegal maintenance of a standing army during peacetime, widely recognized as a threat to liberty, but defended by .&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Daniel-Defoe Daniel Defoe]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/StreamGate?folder_id=0&amp;dvs=1543091512651~514 The Political Ideas of Daniel Defoe]&lt;br/&gt;An Argument Showing That a Standing Army with Consent of Parliament is Not Inconsistant with a Free Government, (l698)&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1707 — Queen Anne's Governor — A pamphlet war in Boston, criticizing Queen Anne's choice of governor for the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], a proxy attack criticizing [[Queen Anne's War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/becomingamer/ideas/text5/pamphletdebate.pdf] Is the Governor
Corrupt? A Pamphlet War in Boston&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1721 — Bank of Ireland Charter — One of the many rhetorical conflicts in which [[Jonathan Swift]] took part, attacking what he and Daniel DeFoe called "air money", certificates of gold or land deposits being used like paper money by the Bank of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cola.unh.edu/sites/cola.unh.edu/files/departments/English/pdf/Moore-Full-Book.pdf] Swift, the Book, and the
Irish Financial Revolution&lt;br/&gt;"The pamphlet war over the bank that took shape during the parliamentary session apparently did much to undermine confidence in the bank and its paper credit."&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1764 — The [[Paxton Boys]] — Tension over a failure to protect a frontier village from tribal aggression peaked with a massacre of innocent [[Paxton Boys|Conestoga]] Indians. After [[Ben Franklin]] interceded, the conflict was primarily conducted through pamphleteering, which is seen by some as having proved a non-violent alternative to the previous violence.&lt;ref name=paxton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/621026 restricted access Unmasking the Paxton Boys: The Material Culture of the Pamphlet War]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1765 — [[The Stamp Act]] — A tax imposed on the American colonies after the [[Seven Years' War]] sparked a pamphlet war that helped set the terminology and arguments for the [[American Revolution]] a decade later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/John_Carter_Brown_Library/exhibitions/pamphletWars/ Pamphlet Wars, Arguments on Paper from the Age of Revolutions]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1776 — [[The American Revolution]] — Progress toward secession from the British Empire was based primarily on debates carried out in pamphlet form, including outrage over the [[Boston Massacre]] and also the crucial publication that swung sentiment from reform to secession, [[Common Sense]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bl.uk/the-american-revolution/articles/the-pamphlet-war-and-the-boston-massacre The Pamphlet War and the Boston Massacre]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1787 — Federalism — In the US, the most famous pamphlet war was probably the debate over the US Constitution{{cn|date=November 2018}}, between [[The Federalist Papers]] and [[The Anti-Federalist Papers]], the former including [[James Madison]], [[John Adams]], and [[Alexander Hamilton]], the latter [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] (writing as Cato), [[Melancton Smith]] (writing as Brutus), and [[Richard Henry Lee]] (writing as the Federal Farmer).

=== Bayard Rustin 2013 Commemoration Project ===
[[File:Bayard Rustin NYWTS 3.jpg|alt=Bayard Rustin|thumb|right|[[Bayard Rustin]] (left) outside the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
On the 50th anniversary of the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], the organization is honoring the courage and legacy of the march's chief organizer, openly gay civil rights leader [[Bayard Rustin]]. In addition to organizing the 1963 march, Rustin was also known for mentoring [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and helping to form the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC).

Led by NBJC co-founder and [[activism|political activist]] [[Mandy Carter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Old-Lesbians-Organizing-for-Change-gather-in-St-Louis/43826.html | title=Old Lesbians Organizing for Change gather in St. Louis | work=[[Windy City Times]] | date=July 24, 2013 | accessdate=July 25, 2013 | author=Baim, Tracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; the initiative includes ongoing collaborations with [[Walter Naegle]], Rustin's surviving partner as well as the executor and archivist of Bayard Rustin's [[estate (law)|estate]]. The organization is also working with [[Nancy Kates]] and Bennett Singer, co-producers and co-directors of Brother Outsider: The Life of Bayard Rustin, a biographical documentary about Rustin.&lt;ref name="nbjc-bayard"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nbjc.org/bayard-rustin | title=Bayard Rustin 2013 Commemoration Project | publisher=National Black Justice Coalition | accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmp1112"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://paulimurrayproject.org/still-walking-for-justice-november-3-2012/ | title=Still Walking for Justice - November 3, 2012 | publisher=Pauli Murray Project | accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black Church Summit ===
In 2006, the organization held its first Black Church Summit in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. During the first summit, the [[Rev. Al Sharpton]] denounced homophobia and called for greater inclusion of LGBT people.&lt;ref name="npr512"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/2012/05/22/153282066/blacks-gays-and-the-church-a-complex-relationship | title=Blacks, Gays And The Church: A Complex Relationship | work=[[NPR]] | date=May 22, 2012 | accessdate=July 25, 2013 | author=Dade, Corey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black, Trans and Proud ===
Black, Trans &amp; Proud, a campaign promoting trans visibility and raising consciousness in the black community, was launched in honor of [[Transgender Awareness Week]]. The project called for community members to submit their photos and testimonials about their pride in the black trans community. As part of the campaign, NBJC featured ads with transgender leaders, including [[Kye Allums]], Rev. Carmarion Anderson, Kylar Broadus, [[Laverne Cox]], [[Janet Mock]],&lt;ref name="bklynboihood1112"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bklynboihood.tumblr.com/post/35781904982/writer-and-trans-activist-janet-mock-tells-nbjc | title=Writer and trans activist Janet Mock tells NBJC why she’s proud to be Black and trans | work=bklyn boihood | date=November 15, 2012 | accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monica Roberts, and Valerie Spencer.&lt;ref name="nbjc-blacktrans"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nbjc.org/black-trans-and-proud | title=Black, Trans and Proud | publisher=National Black Justice Coalition | accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emerging Leaders Initiative ===
This program identifies young activists (ages 18–30) in the black LGBT movement, and provides opportunities for young leaders to build networks and take action in their communities.&lt;ref name="nbjc-emerging"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nbjc.org/emerging-leaders-initiative | title=Emerging Leaders Initiative | publisher=National Black Justice Coalition | accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization hosted the 2013 Black LGBT Emerging Leaders Day in conjunction with the [[Human Rights Campaign]] and the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]] on February 21, 2013 in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="bklynboihood313"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bklynboihood.com/blog/2013/3/6/quick-recap-nbjc-emerging-lgbt-leaders-day-in-dc.html | title=Quick Recap: NBJC Emerging LGBT Leaders Day in DC | work=bklyn boihood | date=March 6, 2013 | accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Many Faces. One Dream. ===
''"Many Faces. One Dream."'' is a series of LGBT economic conferences for LGBT communities of color co-hosted by NBJC and the U.S. Small Business Administration. The events began in early 2013 and will eventually travel to 13 major cities throughout the country that have a significant LGBT presence in communities of color, including [[Atlanta]], [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Ft. Lauderdale]]/[[Miami]], [[Houston]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New Orleans]], [[New York City]], [[Newark, New Jersey]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]/[[San Francisco]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]
 
Participants are grouped into two tracks: "Starting Your Business" and "Taking Your Business to the Next Level." In the first track, training is provided on business plans, loans, marketing, and SBA's program and services. The second track is designed for LGBT firms that are currently in business, with a desire to expand and grow.&lt;ref name="btl713"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=61292 | title=SBA And NBJC Team Up | work=[[Between the Lines (newspaper)|Between the Lines]] | date=July 18, 2013 | accessdate=July 25, 2013 | author=Stevenson, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbjc-manyfaces"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nbjc.org/many-faces-one-dream | title=Many Faces.

Attendees - black LGBT activists, allies, elected officials, faith leaders and youth - discuss and implement strategies to educate federal lawmakers about public policies impacting the black LGBT community.&lt;ref name="lgbtweekly211" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jet912"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://jetmag.com/news/national-conference-supports-black-lgbt/ | title=National Conference Supports Black LGBT | publisher=[[Jet (magazine)|JET]] | date=September 19, 2012 | accessdate=July 25, 2013 | author=Rea, Julius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbjc-outhill"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nbjc.org/get-involved/out-on-the-hill | title=OUT on the HIll | publisher=National Black Justice Coalition | accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== #whatablacklesbianlookslike ===
After the [[Lieutenant Governor of Florida]], [[Jennifer Carroll]], avoided answering questions about an alleged same-sex encounter with a female subordinate by telling a local news outlet that black lesbian and bisexual women ‘don’t look like her’ in the summer of 2012, NBJC launched a campaign with the [[Twitter]] [[hashtag]] #whatablacklesbianlookslike.&lt;ref name="elixher912"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://elixher.com/week-in-review-september-2-september-8/ | title=Week in Review (September 2 – September 8) | work=ELIXHER | date=September 8, 2012 | accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After more than a week of pressure from groups like NBJC, [[Equality Florida]] and [[GLAAD]], Carroll finally apologized, calling her comments "wrong and inexcusable" in a letter to Equality Florida's executive director [[Nadine Smith]].&lt;ref name="nbjc-carroll"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nbjc.org/whatablacklesbianlookslike | title=whatablacklesbianlookslike | publisher=National Black Justice Coalition | accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBJC was founded on December 8, 2003 by a group of eight [[Black people|black]] civil rights leaders&lt;ref name="metro905" /&gt; - [[Keith Boykin]],&lt;ref name="lgbtran-sylvia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lgbtran.org/Interview.aspx?ID=22 | title=Sylvia Rhue - Oral History Interview - LGBT-RAN | publisher=LGBT Religious Archives Network | accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mandy Carter]],&lt;ref name="bvu412"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bvu.edu/about/news/detail.dot?id=1727e5db-797d-4b14-b8c6-31e131ab6463 | title=Social Justice Activist Mandy Carter to Speak at BVU | publisher=[[Buena Vista University]] | date=April 2, 2012 | accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jasmyne Cannick, Donna Payne, [[Frank Leon Roberts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nbjc.org/about/board|title=NBJC Board Members {{!}} National Black Justice Coalition|website=nbjc.org|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonya Shields, Roddrick Colvin, and Maurice Franklin. The formation of the organization was announced during a press conference held at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="taskforce1203" /&gt; Initially the group came together to challenge support from [[African American]] religious and civil rights leaders for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-led efforts to amend the [[U.S. Constitution]] to prohibit [[same-sex marriage]]. Instead, the group began raising money to place [[advertising|advertisements]] promoting same-sex marriage in the African American media. Within three years, the group had created an organization and employed a staff led by founding [[executive director]] H. Alexander Robinson.&lt;ref name="metro905" /&gt;

In July 2009. the organization became the first black LGBT group to address the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) board of governors when its deputy executive director, [[Jason Bartlett (politician)|Jason W. Bartlett]], urged the NAACP to pass resolutions issues pertaining to LGBT [[Person of color|people of color]].&lt;ref name="rod709"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rodonline.typepad.com/rodonline/2009/07/-black-lgbt-group-addresses-naacp-convention.html | title=NBJC First Black LGBT Group to Address NAACP Convention | work=Rod 2.0 | date=July 17, 2009 | accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, it was announced that Sharon Lettman-Hicks would be joining the organization as executive director. She had previously worked at [[People for the American Way]] as executive vice president of leadership programs and external affairs.&lt;ref name="advocate1009" /&gt;

The '''National Party of Australia''' (also known as '''The Nationals''' or simply, '''The Nats''') is an [[List of political parties in Australia|Australian political party]]. Traditionally representing graziers, farmers, and rural voters generally, it began as the '''Australian Country Party''' in 1920 at a federal level. It would later briefly adopt the name '''National Country Party''' in 1975, before adopting its current name in 1982.

Federally, and in New South Wales, and to an extent in Victoria and historically in Western Australia, it has, in government, been the minor party in a centre-right [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] with the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], and its leader has usually served as [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|Deputy Prime Minister]]. In Opposition the Coalition was usually maintained, but otherwise still generally continued to work in co-operation with the Liberal Party of Australia (and their predecessors the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] and [[United Australia Party]]). In Queensland however, they were the senior coalition party between 1925 and 2008, after which they merged with the junior Liberal Party of Australia to form the [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] (LNP).

The current leader of the National Party is [[Michael McCormack (Australian politician)|Michael McCormack]], who won a [[National Party of Australia leadership election, 2018|leadership spill]] following [[Barnaby Joyce]]'s resignation in February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/michael-mccormack-new-deputy-prime-minister-nationals-leader-20180226-p4z1pf.html |title=Michael McCormack new Deputy Prime Minister, Nationals leader |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=26 February 2018 |accessdate=26 February 2018 |last=Kenny |first=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deputy leader of the Nationals, since 7 December 2017, is [[Bridget McKenzie]].

The Country Party was formally founded in 1913 in Western Australia, and nationally in 1920 from a number of state-based parties such as the [[Victorian Farmers' Union]] (VFU) and the [[Farmers and Settlers Party]] of [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="Aitkin, 1972; Graham, 1959"&gt;Aitkin, (1972); Graham, (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's first Country Party was founded in 1912 by [[Harry J. Stephens]], editor of ''[[The Farmer &amp; Settler]]'', but under fierce opposition from rival newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article127694704 |title=That Alleged Country Party |newspaper=[[The Richmond River Herald and Northern Districts Advertiser]] |location=NSW |date=4 July 1913 |accessdate=16 April 2015 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; failed to gain momentum.

The VFU won a seat in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] at the [[Corangamite by-election, 1918|Corangamite by-election]] held in December 1918, with the help of the newly introduced [[Instant-runoff voting|preferential voting]] system.&lt;ref name=flinders&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65119991 |title=CORANGAMITE. |newspaper=The North Western Advocate and the Emu Bay Times |location=Tas. |date=21 December 1918 |accessdate=12 November 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[Australian federal election, 1919|1919 federal election]] the state-based Country Parties won federal seats in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. They also began to win seats in state parliaments. In 1920 the Country Party was established as a national party led by [[William McWilliams]] from Tasmania. In his first speech as leader, McWilliams laid out the principles of the new party, stating "we crave no alliance, we spurn no support but we intend drastic action to secure closer attention to the needs of primary producers"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Neilson, W. (1986) 'McWilliams, William James (1856–1929)', ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', Volume 10, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt; McWilliams was deposed as party leader in favour of Dr [[Earle Page]] in April 1921 following instances where McWilliams voted against the party line. McWilliams would later leave the Country Party to sit as an Independent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

According to historian B. D. Graham (1959), the graziers who operated the sheep stations were politically conservative. They disliked the Labor Party, which represented their workers, and feared that Labor governments would pass unfavorable legislation and listen to foreigners and communists. The graziers were satisfied with the marketing organisation of their industry, opposed any change in land tenure and labour relations, and advocated lower tariffs, low freight rates, and low taxes. On the other hand, Graham reports, the small farmers, not the graziers, founded the Country party. The farmers advocated government intervention in the market through price support schemes and marketing pools. The graziers often politically and financially supported the Country party, which in turn made the Country party more conservative.&lt;ref&gt;B.D. Graham, "Graziers in Politics, 1917 To 1929", ''Historical Studies: Australia and New Zealand'', 1959, Vol. 8 Issue 32, pp 383–391&lt;/ref&gt;

The Country Party's first election as a united party, in [[Australian federal election, 1922|1922]], saw it in an unexpected position of power. It won enough seats to deny the Nationalists an overall majority, and was the Nationalists' only realistic coalition partner. However, Page let it be known that his party would not serve under Hughes, and forced his resignation. Page then entered negotiations with the Nationalists' new leader, [[Stanley Bruce]], for a coalition government. Page's terms were stiff—five seats in a Cabinet of 11, including the [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] portfolio and the second rank in the ministry for himself. Nonetheless, Bruce readily agreed, and the "Bruce-Page Ministry" was formed—thus beginning the tradition of the party's leader ranking second in Coalition cabinets.&lt;ref name="Aitkin, 1972; Graham, 1959"/&gt;

Page remained dominant in the party until 1939 and briefly served as an interim Prime Minister between the death of [[Joseph Lyons]] and the election of [[Robert Menzies]] as his successor, but Page's refusal to serve under Menzies led to his resignation as leader. The coalition was re-formed under [[Archie Cameron]] in 1940, and continued until October 1941 despite the election of [[Arthur Fadden]] as leader after the 1940 Election. Fadden was well regarded within conservative circles and proved to be a loyal deputy to Menzies in the difficult circumstances of 1941. When Menzies was forced to resign as Prime Minister, the UAP was so bereft of leadership that Fadden briefly succeeded him (despite the Country Party being the junior partner in the governing coalition). However, the two independents who had been propping up the government rejected Fadden's budget and brought the government down.&lt;ref name="Davey 2006"&gt;Davey (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Fadden stood down in favour of Labor leader [[John Curtin]].

The Fadden-led Coalition made almost no headway against Curtin, and was severely defeated in the [[Australian federal election, 1943|1943 election]].  After that loss, Fadden became deputy Leader of the Opposition under Menzies, a role that continued after Menzies folded the UAP into the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] in 1944. Fadden remained a loyal partner of Menzies, though he was still keen to assert the independence of his party. Indeed, in the lead up to the [[Australian federal election, 1949|1949 federal election]], Fadden played a key role in the defeat of the Chifley Labor government, frequently making inflammatory claims about the "socialist" nature of the Labor Party, which Menzies could then "clarify" or repudiate as he saw fit, thus appearing more "moderate". In 1949, Fadden became Treasurer in the second Menzies government and remained so until his retirement in 1958. His successful partnership with Menzies was one of the elements that sustained the coalition, which remained in office until 1972 (Menzies himself retired in 1966).&lt;ref name="Davey 2006"/&gt;

[[File:Embassy of Argentina in Canberra.jpg|left|thumb|upright|John McEwen House, The National Party's headquarters in [[Canberra]]]]

Fadden's successor, [[Minister for Trade (Australia)|Trade Minister]] [[John McEwen]], took the then unusual step of declining to serve as Treasurer, believing he could better ensure that the interests of Australian primary producers were safeguarded. Accordingly, McEwen personally supervised the signing of the first post-war trade treaty with Japan, new trade agreements with New Zealand and Britain, and Australia's first trade agreement with the USSR (1965). In addition to this he insisted on developing an all encompassing system of tariff protection that would encourage the development of those secondary industries that would "value add" Australia's primary produce. His success in this endeavour is sometimes dubbed "McEwenism". This was the period of the Country Party's greatest power, as was demonstrated in 1962 when McEwen was able to insist that Menzies sack a Liberal Minister who claimed that Britain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]] was unlikely to severely impact on the Australian economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Davey (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Menzies retired in 1966 and was succeeded by [[Harold Holt]]. McEwen thus became the longest-tenured member of the government, with the informal right to veto government policy. The most significant instance that McEwen exercised this came when Holt disappeared in December 1967. [[John Gorton]] became the new Liberal Prime Minister in January 1968. McEwen was sworn in as an interim Prime Minister pending the election of the new Liberal leader. Logically, the Liberals' deputy leader, [[William McMahon]], should have succeeded Holt. However, McMahon was a staunch free-trader, and there were also rumors that he was homosexual. As a result, McEwen told the Liberals that he and his party would not serve under McMahon. McMahon stood down in favour of [[John Gorton]]. It would be only after McEwen announced his retirement that MacMahon would be able to successfully challenge Gorton for the Liberal leadership. McEwen's reputation for political toughness led to him being nicknamed "Black Jack" by his allies and enemies alike.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Barbalet, "Tri-Partism In Australia: The Role of the Australian Country Party", ''Politics'' (00323268), 1975, Vol. 10 Issue 1, pp. 1–11&lt;/ref&gt;

At the state level, from 1957 to 1989, the Country Party under [[Frank Nicklin]] and [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] dominated governments in [[Queensland]]—the last six of those years ruling in its own right, without the Liberals. It also took part in governments in New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bindloss, ''Queensland'' (2002) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

However, successive electoral redistributions after 1964 indicated that the Country Party was losing ground electorally to the Liberals as the rural population declined, and the nature of some parliamentary seats on the urban/rural fringe changed. A proposed merger with the [[Democratic Labor Party (1955-78)|Democratic Labor Party]] (DLP) under the banner of [[National Alliance (Australia)|"National Alliance"]] was rejected when it failed to find favour with voters at the [[Western Australian state election, 1974|1974 state election]].

Also in 1974, the [[Northern Territory]] members of the party joined with its Liberal party members to form the independent [[Country Liberal Party]]. This party continues to represent both parent parties in that territory. A separate party, the Joh-inspired NT Nationals, competed in the 1987 election with former Chief Minister [[Ian Tuxworth]] winning his seat of [[Electoral division of Barkly|Barkly]] by a small margin. However, this splinter group were not endorsed by the national executive and soon disappeared from the political scene.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Moon and Campbell Sharman, ''Australian politics and government'' (2003) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countrymindedness===
"Countrymindedness" was a slogan that summed up the ideology of the Country Party from 1920 through the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Rae Wear, "Countrymindedness Revisited", (Australian Political Science Association, 1990) [http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf online edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723145257/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf |date=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an ideology that was [[Physiocracy|physiocratic]], [[populism|populist]], and decentralist; it fostered rural solidarity and justified demands for government subsidies. "Countrymindedness" grew out of the failure of the country areas to participate in the rapid economic and population expansions that occurred after 1890. The growth of the ideology into urban areas came as most country people migrated to jobs in the cities. Its decline was due mainly to the reduction of real and psychological differences between country and city brought about by the postwar expansion of the Australian urban population and to the increased affluence and technological changes that accompanied it.&lt;ref&gt;Don Aitkin, "'Countrymindedness': The Spread of an Idea", ''ACH: The Journal of the History of Culture in Australia'', April 1985, Vol. 4, pp. 34–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.J. Duncan, "The demise of 'countrymindedness': New players or changing values in Australian rural politics?" Political Geography, Sep 1992, Vol. 11 Issue 5, pp. 430–448&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Country Party, and National Party ===
In 1975 the Country Party changed its name to the National Country Party as part of a strategy to expand into urban areas. This had some success in Queensland under [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]], but nowhere else. In Western Australia, the party briefly walked out of the coalition agreement in Western Australia in May 1975, returning within the month. However, the party split in two over the decision and other factors in late 1978, with a new National Party forming and becoming independent, holding three seats in the Western Australian lower house, while the National Country Party remained in coalition and also held three seats. They reconciled after the Burke Labor government came to power in 1983.

The 1980s were dominated by the feud between Bjelke-Petersen and the federal party leadership.  Bjelke-Petersen briefly triumphed in 1987, forcing the Nationals to tear up the Coalition agreement and support his bid to become Prime Minister.  The "[[Joh for Canberra]]" campaign backfired spectacularly when a large number of three-cornered contests allowed Labor to win a third term under [[Bob Hawke]].  It also proved to be the Queensland Nationals' last hurrah; Bjelke-Petersen was forced into retirement a few months after the federal election, and his party was heavily defeated in 1989. The Nationals experienced difficulties in the late 1990s from two fronts – firstly from the Liberal Party, who were winning seats on the basis that the Nationals were not seen to be a sufficiently separate party, and from the [[One Nation Party]] riding a swell of rural discontent with many of the policies such as [[multiculturalism]] and [[Gun politics in Australia|gun control]] embraced by all of the major parties. The rise of Labor in formerly safe National-held areas in rural Queensland, particularly on the coast, has been the biggest threat to the Queensland Nationals.

In 2018, it was revealed that the NSW National party and its youth wing, the [[Young Nationals (Australia)|Young Nationals]] had been infiltrated by neo-Nazis with more than 30 members being investigated for alleged links to [[neo-Nazism]]. Several suspected neo-Nazis were expelled from the party and its youth wing. &lt;ref&gt;An abridged list of articles discussing neo-Nazi infiltration:

Party leader Michael McCormack denounced these attempts stating that "The Nationals will not tolerate extremism or the politics of hate. People found to engage with such radicalism are not welcome in our party. We are a grassroots party proudly championing what matters most to our regional and rural communities – always has been, always will be." However former leader Barnaby Joyce initially called the reports "McCarthyist witch-hunts for the reds under the bed" and questioning the evidence behind the claims. He later went back on these claims and called for the group to be dismissed from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/02/barnaby-joyce-sceptical-of-neo-nazi-infiltration-of-nsw-nationals|title='These guys are crazy': Barnaby Joyce backs 'Nazi' expulsions after backtrack|last=Press|first=Australian Associated|date=2018-11-02|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queensland===
{{further|National Party of Australia – Queensland|Liberal National Party of Queensland}}
Queensland is the only state in which the Nationals have consistently been the stronger coalition partner. The Nationals were the senior partner in the non-Labor Coalition from the 1950s until the Coalition was broken up in 1983 and at the [[Queensland state election, 1983|following state election]] the Nationals (under [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]]) came up one seat short of a majority at the election, but gained one a few weeks later after Don Lane and Brian Austin crossed the floor to join the Nationals. The Nationals subsequently governed in their own right until [[Queensland state election, 1989|1989]].

The Queensland branch of the Country Party was the first to change its name to the National Party in April 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p69721/html/ch10.xhtml?referer=108&amp;page=14#toc-anchor|title=The Ayes Have It: The History of the Queensland Parliament, 1957–1989|last1=Wanna|first1=John|last2=Arklay|first2=Tracey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continued success of the [[Australian Labor Party]] at a state level has put pressure on the Nationals' links with the Liberal Party, their traditional coalition partner. In most states, the Coalition agreement is not in force when the parties are in opposition, allowing the two parties greater freedom of action.

In Queensland the National Party merged with the Liberal Party to form the Liberal National Party (LNP) in 2008. The LNP led by Lawrence Springborg went on to lose the March 2009 election to Anna Bligh's Australian Labor Party. However, in the [[Queensland state election, 2012|2012 state election]], the LNP defeated the Labor Party in a landslide, but lost government in the 2015 landslide to Labor, also losing in 2018.

===South Australia===
{{further|National Party of Australia (SA)}}
In South Australia, for the first time in the Nationals' history, in 2002 the single Nationals member in the House of Assembly entered the Rann Labor Government as a Minister forming an informal coalition between the two parties. Since the 2010 South Australian State election, the Nationals in South Australia have no representative in either the House of Assembly or the Upper House or at a Federal level. There existed a distinctly different [[Country Party (South Australia)|Country Party]] in South Australia which merged with the [[Liberal Federation]] to become the [[Liberal and Country League]] in 1932.

===Tasmania===

The Nationals were stung in early 2006, when their only Victorian senator, [[Julian McGauran]], defected to the Liberals and created a serious rift between the Nationals and the Liberals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/pm-urges-vic-libs-to-accept-mcgauran/2006/01/30/1138469628770.html Libs 'involved' in McGauran defection], ''[[The Age]]'', 30 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Several commentators believed that changing demographics and unfavourable preference deals would demolish the Nationals at the [[Victorian state election, 2006|state election]] that year, but they went on to enjoy considerable success by winning two extra lower house seats. The Nationals were in a [[Coalition (Australia)|coalition]] government with the Liberals at a State level in Victoria until their defeat at the [[Victorian state election, 2014|2014 election]]. Following the election, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] reported that the coalition parties would "review" whether to continue their joint working arrangement into opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-30/national-party-to-review-coalition-with-liberals-in-victoria/5929124|title=Victoria election 2014: National Party to 'review' coalition with Liberals in Victoria|work=ABC News|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both outgoing Nationals leader [[Peter Ryan (politician)|Peter Ryan]] and incoming Liberal leader [[Matthew Guy]] indicated they felt the coalition should continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-01/peter-ryan-stands-down-as-leader-of-victorian-national-party/5930578|title=Peter Ryan stands down as leader of Victorian National Party|work=ABC News|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-04/matthew-guy-to-lead-liberals/5940300|title=Matthew Guy elected as new Liberal Party leader in Victoria|work=ABC News|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Australia===
{{details|National Party of Australia (WA)}}
Western Australia's National Party chose to assert its independence after an acrimonious co-habitation with the Liberals on the [[Western Australian state election, 2005|2005 campaign trail]]. Unlike its New South Wales and Queensland counterparts, the WA party had decided to oppose Liberal candidates in the [[Western Australia state election, 2008|2008 election]]. The party aimed to hold the balance of power in the state "as an independent conservative party" ready to negotiate with the Liberals or Labor to form a minority government. After the election, the Nationals negotiated an agreement to form a government with the Liberals and an independent MP, though not described as a "traditional coalition" due to the reduced [[cabinet collective responsibility]] of National cabinet members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Labor's clean sweep broken |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24343802-1245,00.html |work=News.com.au |publisher= |location=Sydney |date=2008-09-14 |accessdate=2008-09-14 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western Australia's one-vote-one-value reforms will cut the number of rural seats in the state assembly to reflect the rural population level: this, coupled with the Liberals' strength in country areas has put the Nationals under significant pressure.

===Australian Capital Territory===
The Nationals have rarely organised or stood in the Australian Capital Territory. Federally their only candidatures were in the [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 election]] when they contested both constituencies and secured 3.5% of the territory vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carr |first=Adam |url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1974/1974reps1.txt |title=1974 House of Representatives: National and state summaries |work=Psephos Election Archive |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 1989|the first election to the Legislative Assembly]] in 1989 [[David Adams (Australian politician)|David Adams]], a former [[Liberal Party of Australia (Australian Capital Territory Division)|Liberal]] member of the old [[Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly|House of Assembly]], headed a list of three candidates for the Nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elections.act.gov.au/elections_and_voting/past_act_legislative_assembly_elections/1989_election/list_of_elected_candidates_1989_election |title=List of elected candidates - 1989 Election |publisher=Elections ACT |date= |accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They received 1947 votes (1.37%) and did not get any members elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elections.act.gov.au/elections_and_voting/past_act_legislative_assembly_elections/1989_election/first_preference_results_1989_election |title=First Preference Results - 1989 Election |publisher=Elections ACT |date=2015-01-06 |accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party has not stood in the territory since.

===Northern Territory===

{{section stub|date=June 2018}}

==Political role==
The Nationals see their main role as giving a voice to Australians who live outside the country's metropolitan areas.

Traditionally, the leader of the National Party serves as [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|Deputy Prime Minister]] when the Coalition is in government. This tradition dates back to the creation of the office in 1968.

The National Party's support base and membership are closely associated with the agricultural community. Historically anti-union, the party has vacillated between state support for primary industries ("[[agrarianism|agrarian]] [[socialism]]") and free agricultural trade and has opposed tariff protection for Australia's manufacturing and service industries. This vacillation prompted those opposed to the policies of the Nationals to joke that its real aim was to "capitalise its gains and socialise its losses!". It is usually pro-mining, pro-development, and anti-environmentalist.

The Nationals vote is in decline and its traditional supporters are turning instead to prominent independents such as [[Bob Katter]], [[Tony Windsor]] and [[Peter Andren]] in [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] and similar independents in the Parliaments of [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], many of whom are former members of the National Party. In fact since the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 Federal election]], National Party candidates received fewer first preference votes than the [[Australian Greens]].

Demographic changes are not helping, with fewer people living and employed on the land or in small towns, the continued growth of the larger provincial centres, and, in some cases, the arrival of left-leaning "city refugees" in rural areas. The Liberals have also gained support as the differences between the coalition partners on a federal level have become invisible. This was highlighted in January 2006, when Nationals Senator [[Julian McGauran]] defected to the Liberals, saying that there was "no longer any real distinguishing policy or philosophical difference".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/senator-mcgauran-quits-nationals/2006/01/23/1137864841636.html |title=Senator McGauran quits Nationals – National |publisher=theage.com.au |date=2006-01-23 |accessdate=2010-04-30 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Queensland, Nationals leader [[Lawrence Springborg]] advocated merger of the National and Liberal parties at a state level in order to present a more effective opposition to the Labor Party. Previously this plan had been dismissed by the Queensland branch of the Liberal party, but the idea received in-principle support from the Liberals. Federal leader [[Mark Vaile]] stated the Nationals will not merge with the Liberal Party at a federal level. The plan was opposed by key Queensland Senators [[Ron Boswell]] and [[Barnaby Joyce]], and was scuttled in 2006. After suffering defeat in the 2006 Queensland poll, Lawrence Springborg was replaced by [[Jeff Seeney]], who indicated he was not interested in merging with the Liberal Party until the issue is seriously raised at a Federal level.

In September 2008, Joyce replaced CLP Senator and Nationals deputy leader [[Nigel Scullion]] as leader of the Nationals in the Senate, and stated that his party in the upper house would no longer necessarily vote with their Liberal counterparts in the upper house, which opened up another possible avenue for the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Labor Government]] to get legislation through.&lt;ref name="news.smh.com.au"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/national/nationals-wont-toe-libs-line-joyce-20080918-4isw.html |title=Nationals won't toe Libs' line: Joyce |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=18 September 2008 |accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theaustralian.news.com.au"&gt;{{cite news |author=Berkovic, Nicola |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24363515-5013404,00.html |title=Leader Barnaby Joyce still a maverick |work=[[The Australian]] |date=18 September 2008 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411170657/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24363515-5013404,00.html |archive-date=11 April 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce was elected leader in a party-room ballot on 11 February 2016, following the retirement of former leader and Deputy Prime Minister [[Warren Truss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/feb/11/warren-truss-to-reveal-his-retirement-plans-politics-live?page=with:block-56bc5be2e4b072fd3ded30f5#block-56bc5be2e4b072fd3ded30f5 |title=Barnaby Joyce wins Nationals leadership, Fiona Nash named deputy |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=Australia |author=Murphy, Katharine |date=11 February 2016 |accessdate=11 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/parliament-pays-tribute-to-retiring-deputy-pm-warren-truss-ahead-of-barnaby-joyce-elevation-20160210-gmr3ca.html |title=Parliament pays tribute to retiring deputy PM Warren Truss ahead of Barnaby Joyce elevation |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |author=Gartrell, Adam |date=11 February 2016 |accessdate=11 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-11/barnaby-joyce-named-as-new-nationals-leader/7161584 |title=Barnaby Joyce elected unopposed as new Nationals leader |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |author=Keany, Francis |date=11 February 2016 |accessdate= 11 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/12/03/2107931.htm |title=Truss wins Nationals leadership |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=3 December 2007 |accessdate=30 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce was one of five politicians disqualified from parliament in October 2017 [[2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis|for holding dual citizenship]], along with former deputy leader, [[Fiona Nash]].

==Liberal/National merger==
{{Main|Liberal–National party merger}}
Merger plans came to a head in May 2008, when the Queensland state Liberal Party gave an announcement not to wait for a federal blueprint but instead to merge immediately. The new party, the [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]], was founded in July 2008.

===List of Senate leaders===
The Country Party's first senators began their terms in 1926, but the party had no official leader in the upper chamber until 1935. Instead, the party nominated a "representative" or "liaison officer" where necessary – usually [[William Carroll (Australian politician)|William Carroll]]. This was so that its members "were first and foremost representatives of their states, able to enjoy complete freedom of action and speech in the Senate and not beholden to the dictates of [...] a party Senate leader". On 3 October 1935, [[Charles Hardy (Australian politician)|Charles Hardy]] was elected as Carroll's replacement and began using the title "Leader of the Country Party in the Senate". This usage was disputed by Carroll and [[Bertie Johnston]], but a subsequent party meeting on 10 October confirmed Hardy's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4BoBjz6pHwUC|title=Ninety Not Out: The Nationals 1920–2010|author=Paul Davey|year=2010|publisher=UNSW Press|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after Hardy's term ended in 1938 (due to his defeat at the 1937 election), the party did not elect another Senate leader until 1949 – apparently due to its small number of senators.&lt;ref&gt;Davey (2010), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; In the [[Northern Territory]], the [[Country Liberal Party]] endorses National candidates for the Senate and Liberal candidates for the House of Representatives.

'''New Mexico Wilderness Act of 1980''', Public Law 96-550, is a [[U.S. federal law]] that authorized the establishment of a number of designated Wilderness Areas on [[United States National Forest|National Forest]] land in [[New Mexico]]. The law also added additional lands to four existing [[National Wilderness Preservation System|Wilderness Areas]] in New Mexico, and named several Forest areas for study as potential Wilderness Areas.  The law also created two new [[National Park Service]] units, [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park]] and [[Salinas National Monument]], from existing NPS lands.  By means of this law approximately 400,000 acres of forest land were designated as Wilderness Areas, as described by the [[Wilderness Act of 1964]], and approximately 75,000 additional acres were designated as Wilderness Study Areas for possible future inclusion in the Wilderness program.

==Background==
Responding to a heightened public interest in conservation and an increased threat to public lands by development, and other intrusive or consumptive activities, such as logging, Congress passed the Wilderness Act of 1964, Public Law 88-577 (16 U.S.C. 1131-1136) on September 3, 1964.  
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wilderness.net/nwps/legisact&lt;/ref&gt;  Created, in the words of the law, "to secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness," the law created the National Wilderness Preservation System and a set of criteria and administrative processes by which natural areas could be added to this system.&lt;ref&gt;16 U.S.C. 1131-1136&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this new law, proposed areas on [[U.S. Forest Service]], [[National Park Service]], and [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] could be designated as Wilderness Areas, special reserves protected from human encroachment and development.  Within these areas, unless specially exempted, Congress mandated that there "shall be no commercial enterprise and no permanent road within any wilderness area designated by this Act and, except as necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area...there shall be no temporary road, no use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment or motorboats, no landing of aircraft, no other form of mechanical transport, and no structure or installation within any such area."  To be kept in as close to a pristine natural state as possible, these areas would only be open to hikers and backpackers, who would be expected to follow low-impact, "pack-in/pack out" camping practices.&lt;ref&gt;16 U.S.C. 1131-1136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative History==

What would eventually become Public Law 96-550 was first proposed to the House of Representatives by [[Manuel Lujan Jr.]], the representative of New Mexico's 1st Congressional District on October 2, 1980.  Designated House Resolution 8298 (96th) the bill was discussed in both the House Agriculture and Natural Resources Committees before being approved on November 21, 1980, six weeks after its introduction.  After passing through the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the bill was passed in identical form to the House version on December 1, 1980.  Eighteen days later, on December 19, 1980, the bill, now known as the New Mexico Wilderness Act of 1980, was signed by the President.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/96/hr8298&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title I==
Title 1, Section 102 of the new law authorized the establishment of nine new Wilderness Areas and the addition of lands to three existing Wilderness Areas on National Forest land in New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;94 stat. 3221 Title I, Section 102&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Apache Kid and Withington Wilderness Areas Map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Apache Kid and Withington Wilderness Areas, Cibola National Forest]]
The Wilderness Areas established included:

*The 211,300 acre [[Aldo Leopold Wilderness]] in the [[Gila National Forest]]
*The 45,000 acre [[Apache Kid Wilderness]] in the [[Cibola National Forest]]
*The 30,000 acre [[Blue Range Wilderness]] in the [[Gila National Forest]]
*The 34,000 acre [[Capitan Mountains Wilderness]] in the [[Lincoln National Forest]]
*The 5,200 acre [[Dome Wilderness]] in the [[Santa Fe National Forest]]
*The 20,000 acre [[Latir Peak Wilderness]] in the [[Carson National Forest]]
*The 19,000 acre [[Withington Wilderness]] in the [[Cibola National Forest]]
*The 18,000 acre [[Cruces Basin Wilderness]] in the [[Carson National Forest]]

Additional lands were added to the following existing Wilderness Areas, including:

*140,000 acres added to the [[Gila Wilderness]] in the Gila National Forest
*14,7000 acres added to the [[Wheeler Peak Wilderness]] in the Carson National Forest
*16,806 acres added to the [[White Mountain Wilderness]] in the Lincoln National Forest
*55,000 acres added to the [[Pecos Wilderness]] in the Carson and Santa Fe National Forests

Title I, Section 103 of the law instructed the [[Secretary of Agriculture]], as the official responsible for the Forest Service and the implementation of the [[Wilderness Act of 1964]] to examine five proposed Wilderness Study Areas to determine their suitability for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation system.  The law further stated that the Secretary's findings should be presented to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[President of the United States|President]] no later than January 1, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;94 stat. 3221 Title I, Section 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The areas proposed for study included:
*The 15,110 acre [[Bunk Robinson Wilderness Study Area]] in the Coronado National Forest
*The 16,000 acre [[Columbine-Hondo Wilderness Study Area]] in the Carson National Forest
*The 18,860 acre [[Hell Hole Wilderness Study Area]] in the Gila National Forest
*The 8,800 acre [[Lower San Francisco Wilderness Study Area]] in the Gila National Forest
*The 7,760 acre [[Whitmire Canyon Wilderness Study Area]] in the Coronado National Forest

[[File:Gila.panorama.jpg|640px|thumb|center|Panoramic view of the Gila Wilderness, Gila National Forest]]

==Title II==

Title II of the law authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to create, in conjunction with the [[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology]], the Langmuir Research Site in the Cibola National Forest.   Noting that the "high altitude and freedom from air pollution and night luminosity caused by human activity" made the Forest "uniquely suited to the conduct of research probes into thunder clouds and for other  atmospheric and astronomical research purposes," the law authorized the use of 31,000 acres of the Cibola National Forest for research use.&lt;ref&gt;94 stat. 3221 Title II&lt;/ref&gt;

==Titles III and IV==
These two short sections of the law authorized the payment of not more than $20,000 to reimburse Albert and Eulalaia Rodriquez for improvements on land within the [[Taos Pueblo Grant]], and gave the Secretary of the Interior the authority to amend the contract between the Vermejo Conservancy District, a [[Bureau of Reclamation]] irrigation project near [[Maxwell, New Mexico]] and the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;94 stat. 3221 Title III/IV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title V==
[[File:Chaco Canyon Chetro Ketl great kiva plaza NPS.jpg|thumb|left|The Great Kiva, Chaco Culture N.H.P.]]
Title V of the law authorized the re-designation of the Chaco Canyon National Monument to [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park]].  Established in 1933, Chaco Canyon National Monument was created to preserve the very large collection of [[Ancestral Puebloan]] dwellings, kivas, and primitive roads located in and around Chaco Canyon in northwestern New Mexico.  In 1980, recognizing the importance of the archaeological research being done in and around Chaco Canyon and the increased public interest in the Ancient Puebloan people Congress authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to designate 31 outlying areas Chaco Culture Archaeological Protection Sites.  Meant to protect these potentially valuable sites from encroachment from energy-related exploration and development, the law authorized the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of Interior]], as the official responsible for the [[National Park Service]], to enter into co-operative agreements with land holders to protect, preserve, maintain, and administer these sites, or if under imminent threat of damage or destruction, to seek title to these lands by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange.&lt;ref&gt;94 stat. 3221 Title V&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title VI==
[[File:Salinas pueblo missions NM.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins at Gran Quivira, Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument]]
The last section of the law authorized the establishment of Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument near [[Mountainair]], New Mexico.  To create this new unit, the law abolished the nearby Gran Quivira National Monument, assigned its 611 acres to the new park, authorized the Secretary of the Interior to acquire an additional 466 acres near Mountainair, and gave permission for the Secretary to acquire other lands as might be need to complete the unit.  Protecting both the ancient Native American ruins and the Missions built in the area by the Spanish, the new park combined the ruins at Gran Quivira, Abo, and Quaraiin into a single administrative unit, with its headquarters in Mountainair.&lt;ref&gt;94 stat. 3221 Title VI&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cairo Nilometer 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Measuring shaft of the Nilometer on Rhoda Island, Cairo]]

Between July and November, the reaches of the Nile running through [[Egypt]] would burst their banks and cover the adjacent [[flood plain]].
When the waters receded, around September or October, they left behind a rich [[Alluvium|alluvial deposit]] of exceptionally fertile black silt over the croplands. The ''akhet'', or [[Season of the Inundation]], was one of the three seasons into which the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians divided their years.

It would be difficult to overstate the importance of the annual flood to Egyptian civilization. A moderate inundation was a vital part of the agricultural cycle; however, a lighter inundation than normal would cause [[famine]], and too much flood water would be equally disastrous, washing away much of the infrastructure built on the flood plain. Records from AD 622&amp;ndash;999 indicate that on average, one year out of every four (28%) saw an inundation that fell short of expectations.&lt;ref name=Fagan/&gt;

The ability to predict the volume of the coming inundation was part of the mystique of the Ancient Egyptian priesthood. The same skill also played a political and administrative role, since the quality of the year's flood was used to determine the levels of tax to be paid. This is where the nilometer came into play, with priests monitoring the day-to-day level of the river and announcing the awaited arrival of the summer flood.

[[File:Nilometer, Cairo, Egypt.jpg|thumb|The ceiling of the Nilometer]]

The simplest nilometer design is a vertical column submerged in the waters of the river, with marked intervals indicating the depth of the water.&lt;ref name=H/&gt;
One that follows this simple design, albeit housed in an elaborate and ornate stone structure, can still be seen on the island of [[Rhoda Island|Rhoda]] in central [[Cairo]]&lt;ref name=H/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fagan/&gt; {{nowrap|({{coord|30.0069|N|31.2250|E|type:landmark_region:EG_source:wikidata|display=inline|name=Rhoda Island nilometer}}).}}  This nilometer dates only as far back as AD&amp;nbsp;861, when the [[Abbasid]] caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] ordered its construction, overseen by the astronomer [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathir al-Farghani|Afraganus]].&lt;ref name=Fagan/&gt; It was built on a site occupied by an earlier specimen which was seen by the Syrian Orthodox patriarch [[Dionysius of Tel Mahre]] in 830.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} This prior nilometer had been ordered in AD&amp;nbsp;715 by Usāma b. Zayd b. ʿAdī, who was in charge of collecting the land tax (''[[kharaj]]'') in Egypt for the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik|Sulaymān ibn ʿAbd al-Malik]].&lt;ref name=Fagan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/FP24037/08#page/n83/mode/1up|title=Tārīkh Madīnat Dimashq|last=Ibn ʿAsākir|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=8:84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nilometer Rhoda Island Cairo June 1966.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Conical structure covers the nilometer on southern tip of [[Rhoda Island]] in the Nile River at Cairo. The structure is modern but the nilometer dates from 715&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name=Fagan/&gt;]]

[[File:Egypt.Aswan.ElephantineIsland.Nilometer.01.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Nilometer on [[Elephantine|Elephantine Island]] ]]  The second nilometer design comprises a flight of stairs leading down into the water, with depth markings along the walls.&lt;ref name=H/&gt;
The best known example of this kind can be seen on the island of [[Elephantine]] in [[Aswan]],&lt;ref name=H/&gt; where a stairway of 52 steps leads down to a doorway at the Nile.&lt;ref name="Farid"&gt;{{cite book |author= Farid Atiya |title= Pocket Book of Ancient Egypt  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LyWNFVeblO8C&amp;pg=PA370 |publisher= |page= 370 |date= 2008 |accessdate= 2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This location was also particularly important, since for much of Egyptian history, Elephantine marked Egypt's southern border and was therefore the first place where the onset of the annual flood was detected.

The most elaborate design involved a channel or culvert that led from the riverbank &amp;ndash; often running for a considerable distance &amp;ndash; and then fed a well, tank, or cistern.&lt;ref name=H/&gt; These nilometer wells were most frequently located within the confines of [[temple]]s, where only the priests and rulers were allowed access.
A particularly fine example, with a deep, cylindrical well and a culvert opening in the surrounding wall, can be seen at the [[Temple of Kom Ombo]], to the north of Aswan.

While nilometers originated in Pharaonic times, they continued to be used by the later civilizations that held sway in Egypt.&lt;ref name=H/&gt; Some were constructed in Roman times.&lt;ref name=H/&gt;

In the 20th century, the Nile's annual inundation was first greatly reduced, and then eliminated entirely, with the construction of the [[Aswan dam]]s.

While the [[Aswan High Dam]]'s impact on Egypt and its agriculture has been controversial for other, more complex reasons, it has also had the additional effect of rendering the nilometer obsolete.

{{Elections}}
A '''parachute candidate''', also known as a “[[carpetbagger]]” in the [[United States]], is a pejorative term&lt;ref name="NDP-crit"&gt;{{cite news|title=NDP criticized for running parachute candidate in Labrador|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/ndp-criticized-for-running-parachute-candidate-in-labrador-1.734870|accessdate=24 Feb 2015|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; for an [[election]] [[candidate]] who does not live in and has little connection to the area he or she is running to represent. The allegation is thus that the candidate is being “parachuted in” for the job by a desperate [[political party]] that has no reliable talent indigenous to the district or state or that the party (or the candidate himself/herself) wishes to give a candidate an easier election than would happen in one's own home area.

==Examples==

===United States===

====U.S. Senate====
*Former U.S. Senator [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]] ran unsuccessfully as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for [[U.S. Senate]] in 2014 in [[New Hampshire]], despite having previously represented [[Massachusetts]] in the Senate as recently as two years prior.  Brown's family had previously resided in New Hampshire, and he personally owns a vacation home in the state.
*Former Reagan administration diplomat [[Alan Keyes]], a resident of [[Maryland]], ran unsuccessfully as a Republican during the 2004 [[Illinois]] U.S. Senate election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/04/illinois.senate/|title=CNN.com - Illinois GOP offers Senate nod to Alan Keyes - Aug 5, 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] successfully became a Senator from New York after having bought a house in [[Chappaqua]], New York (a wealthy NYC suburb) in 1999, prior to the [[United States Senate election in New York, 2000|2000 election]].  She had previously resided in [[Arkansas]].
*Former U.S. Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] was elected to the U.S. Senate in New York in [[United States Senate election in New York, 1964|1964]], serving from 1965 until his death on June 6, 1968. He had previously resided in his home state of [[Massachusetts]].  During the campaign, Kennedy gave a speech in response to criticisms from his opponents over his alleged lack of ties to the state.
*Comedian [[Al Franken]] successfully ran for the US Senate in Minnesota in [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008|2008]], after the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] declared him the winner of a contested recount.  Franken had spent several years as a radio host at [[Air America (radio network)|Air America]] in New York City, but was raised in Minnesota and returned to the state after making plans to become a candidate.  The narrow margin and contested nature of the election's outcome led many conservatives to accuse Franken of stealing the election.

====U.S. House of Representatives====
*Former Maryland State Senator [[Alex Mooney]] ran successfully in 2014 as a Republican to represent [[West Virginia's 2nd congressional district]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/alex-mooney-west-virginia-maryland|title=Meet The Carpetbagging Tea Partier Who Could Be W. Va.'s Newest Rep.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Businessman [[Trey Hollingsworth]] moved from Tennessee to Indiana in September, 2015. He declared his campaign as a Republican to represent [[Indiana's 9th congessional district]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], which was successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/04/25/trey-hollingsworth-joseph-hollingsworth-hollingsworth-capital-partners-greg-zoeller-indiana-ninth-congressional-district/83274574/|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Virginia=====
Former DNC chairman [[Terry McAuliffe]], despite having not held any political office or position in Virginia won election in 2013 to become Virginia's 72nd Governor.

===Canada===

====House of Commons of Canada====
*[[Chrystia Freeland]] faced allegations of being parachuted in by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] to contest a 2013 by-election in safe seat [[Toronto Centre]], given she was living in [[New York City]] at the time, which she ultimately won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/john-ivison-justin-trudeau-parachutes-star-candidate-chrystia-freeland-into-safe-toronto-centre|title=John Ivison: Justin Trudeau parachutes 'star' candidate Chrystia Freeland into safe Toronto Centre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[New Democratic Party]] nominated Phyllis Artis of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] for [[Labrador (electoral district)|Labrador]], who unsuccessfully contested the seat in 2008.&lt;ref name="NDP-crit" /&gt; 
*[[Kellie Leitch]] is considered to be a parachute candidate due to her 2010 nomination in the riding of [[Simcoe-Grey]] in Ontario. Leitch is from Winnipeg, Manitoba, and had no previous ties to the riding.

===New Zealand===
* In 2017 [[Deborah Russell]] won selection for the safe Labour seat of [[New Lynn (New Zealand electorate)|New Lynn]], in south-east [[Auckland]] despite being from [[Whangamomona]], a small town in the [[Manawatu-Wanganui]] region. She beat out Greg Presland a New Lynn resident for 30 years who had the backing of the local members but lost to Russell who was backed by Labour's Council because of her finance expertise and a pledge to have more women in electorates. Upon winning selection Russell moved to the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Trevett, Claire |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11788733 |title=Battle to replace Labour's David Cunliffe in New Lynn heats up |publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=25 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ali, Mahvash |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/western-leader/90091542/the-taranaki-girl-who-wants-to-win-over-new-lynn |title=The "Taranaki girl" who wants to win over New Lynn |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====House of Commons of the United Kingdom====
* [[Shaun Woodward]] MP defected from the Conservatives to Labour in 1999. He faced much criticism from former Conservative colleagues, particularly when he refused to resign and fight a by-election.&lt;ref name=BBCNews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/571883.stm|title=Fallout grows over Tory turncoat|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=20 December 1999|accessdate=12 April 2014|archivedate=13 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413190754/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/571883.stm|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/dec/19/labour.labour1997to99|title=Top Tory defects to Labour|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 December 1999|accessdate=12 April 2012|archivedate=13 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413132209/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/dec/19/labour.labour1997to99|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodward did not run for re-election in his safe Conservative seat of [[Witney (UK Parliament constituency)|Witney]] in [[Oxfordshire]], instead being selected for the ultra-safe Labour seat of [[St Helens South (UK Parliament constituency)|St Helens South]] in [[Merseyside]]. Labour Minister [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]] wrote later in his diaries that "the New Labour elite parachuting [Woodward] into a safe seat ... [was] one of New Labour's vilest stitch-ups ... [it] made my flesh creep."&lt;ref name="Chris Mullin 2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=A View From The Foothills: The Diaries of Chris Mullin|year=2009|author=Chris Mullin|isbn=1-84668-223-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Luciana Berger]] has been considered emblematic of the New Labour policy of parachuting middle-class southerners into safe seats in traditional Labour heartlands such as the northern working-class seat of [[Liverpool Wavertree]]. She was heavily criticised for having no connection to the Wavertree constituency or Liverpool when she first ran in 2010. When asked by a local radio station to answer for basic questions about Liverpool she was unable to, and during the candidate selection process stayed at local MP [[Jane Kennedy (politician)|Jane Kennedy]]'s house rather than make any permanent home in the area. The media raised suggestions that she was only selected for the seat because of her close connections to the Blair family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/crash-landing-for-labour-candidate-parachuted-into-liverpool-1951962.html|title=Crash landing for Labour candidate parachuted into Liverpool|date=23 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to win the seat in 2010 and retain it in 2015.
* [[David Miliband|David]] and [[Ed Miliband]] were selected to fight safe Labour seats in the North, [[South Shields (UK Parliament constituency)|South Shields]] and [[Doncaster North]] respectively despite being Oxford graduates who were born, raised, and living in London whilst working as political advisers.

'''Parisine''' is a typeface created by [[Jean-François Porchez]]. Distributed by [[Typofonderie]].

It is used in [[Paris Métro]], [[tram]]ways, buses and [[Réseau Express Régional|RER]] parts operated by the [[RATP Group]] in [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]]. Starting in 2015, the [[Osaka]] [[Osaka Municipal Subway|City Subway]] in [[Japan]] adopted Parisine as the Latin-character component of its new signage system, which is gradually being introduced throughout its network.

==Parisine==
It was originally developed in 1996 as a custom typeface in Bold and Bold Italic developed for the [[Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens|RATP]] to improve signage legibility and space economy. The design was based on the proportions of [[Helvetica]] Bold, condensed at 90%.

In 1999, the font was extended to a font family for multiple uses like communication material, maps, etc. In 2000, hinted [[TrueType]] versions were added for internal corporate use. The name Parisine is a [[trademark]] of the RATP.

===Parisine Std===
It is an [[OpenType]] variant of Parisine. A [[small caps]] version was produced called Parisine SC, see Parisine PRO for Small Caps.

OpenType features include [[typographic ligature|ligature]]s, fractions, [[subscript and superscript|ordinals/superior]] letters and figures, caps figures, [[text figures|oldstyle figures]] (SC versions only), a tabular figures.

=== Parisine PRO ===
It is an OpenType variant of Parisine, which further expanded upon Parisine Std. Previous version of Parisine PRO was called Parisine PTF.

Each member of the family is composed of more than 720 [[glyph]]s and feature around 26700 [[kerning]] pairs.

OpenType features include small caps, case forms, ligatures, special ligatures, alternates, stylistic sets, caps figures, oldstyle figures, tabular figures, fractions, superscript/subscript, superior/inferior figures, ordinals/superior letters and figures, and ornaments.

== Parisine Plus ==
It is a variant with alternate designs. It includes extra ligatures over the respective classic designs.

=== Parisine Plus Std ===
Some additional alternates glyphs are included in [[PostScript]] Type 1 format.

OpenType features include ligatures, fractions, ordinals/superior letters and figures, caps figures, oldstyle figures (SC versions only), and tabular figures.

=== Parisine Plus PRO ===
It is an expanded OpenType variant of Parisine Plus Std. It was released at the same time as Parisine. Previous version of Parisine Plus PRO was called Parisine Plus PTF.

Each member of the family is composed of more than 900 glyphs and feature around 40000 kerning pairs.

OpenType features include small caps, case forms, ligatures, special ligatures, alternates, stylistic sets, swashes, caps figures, oldstyle figures, tabular figures, fractions, superscript/subscript, superior/inferior figures, ordinals/superior letters and figures, and ornaments.

== Parisine Office ==
''Parisine Office'' was a version created for RATP in 2005, as replacement of [[Gill Sans]]. It became the first variant designed in OpenType. The font was commercially available in June 2008.

It consists of over 600 characters, and is [[metric-compatible]] with Gill Sans. The family has been includes font weights with complementary italics.

OpenType features include case forms, ligatures, special ligatures, alternates, swashes, caps figures, oldstyle figures, semi oldstyle figures, tabular figures, fractions, superscript/subscript, superior/inferior figures, ordinals/superior letters and figures, and ornaments.

=== Parisine Office PRO ===
It is an extension of the original Parisine Office font, featuring smaller x-height, more cursive italic lowercase glyphs than in Parisine, a bit like Parisine Plus, extended character sets. Previous version of Parisine Office PRO was called Parisine Office PTF.

OpenType features include small caps, case forms, ligatures, special ligatures, alternates, stylistic sets, caps figures, oldstyle figures, tabular figures, fractions, superscript/subscript, superior/inferior figures, ordinals/superior letters and figures, and ornaments.

==Parisine Girouette (2012)==
It is a custom version of Parisine designed by Jean-François Porchez under the ZeCraft foundry, for use with LED displays on RATP buses.

Parisine Girouette Frontale is used for the main direction on the front of bus and was designed quite narrow to display a maximum of content.

Parisine Girouette Latérale is also designed at 50% of the size of the main typeface, to set information on the side of the bus. The Bold font is used for the final direction, while the Regular/Light is used for intermediate stops.

== Family naming convention ==
With exception of Parisine SC, Parisine Office, Parisine Girouette, each family contains 6 weights with complementary italics, but it is further divided into 3 subfamily, where the subfamily with Clair suffix includes 2 lightest weights, Sombre suffix includes 2 heaviest weights, subfamily without suffix includes 2 middle weights. Fonts in each subfamily are always named Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic, regardless of actual font weights across the family.

In 2010, The Gris subfamily was added to Parisine PRO family, which includes 2 intermediate font weights between Parisine PRO Clair and Parisine PRO.

In 2013, The Gris subfamily was added to Parisine Plus families, which includes 2 intermediate font weights between Parisine Plus Clair and Parisine Plus. However, Parisine Plus Gris Regular is weighted between Parisine Plus Clair Bold and Parisine Plus Regular, while Parisine Plus Gris Bold is weighted between Parisine Plus Regular and Parisine Plus Bold.

== Awards ==
Parisine Office won a Star of the Observeur 07 at the Design Observeur 07 (Observeur du design 07).&lt;ref&gt;Identifont: [http://www.identifont.com/show?14S Jean-François Porchez]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120425050358/http://www.francedesigninnovation.fr/?cat=98&amp;id=1432&amp;laureat=2007&amp;id_participant=1302 Observeur du design 07 Parisine Office]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patient transport''' is a service that transfers patients to and from medical facilities in non-emergency situations.

In emergency situations, patients are transported by the [[emergency medical services]]. Non-emergency patient transport is sometimes run by the same agency. It is typically provided to a patient who needs to be transferred to a facility that can provide a higher or more specialized level of care (though the EMS may be summoned if this is urgent). It may also be used to transfer patients from a specialized facility to a local hospital or nursing home when they no longer require this specialized care, such as following successful [[cardiac catheterization]] due to a [[heart attack]]. Some countries also offer the service to patients who cannot make their own way to or from the hospital.

==By country==
===United Kingdom===
Patient transport services are provided in the United Kingdom to convey patients to hospitals. The vehicles used are not usually (although there are exceptions) equipped with life-support equipment, and are usually crewed by staff with fewer qualifications than the crew of emergency ambulances. Their purpose is simply to transport patients to, from or between places of treatment.  This is a separate provision from the [[Hospital Travel Costs]] scheme, which is means tested. These services are often provided by [[ambulance]] services using non-emergency vehicles, but may be subject to tendering processes.

Cornwall [[Clinical Commissioning Group]] proposed to restrict this provision for [[dialysis]] patients for those who did not have specific medical or financial reasons in 2018 but changed their minds after a campaign led by [[Kidney Care UK]] and decided to fund transport for patients requiring dialysis three times a week for a minimum of six weeks, or six times a month for a minimum of three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CCG backs down over patient transport funding cuts|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/nhs-kernow-ccg/ccg-backs-down-over-patient-transport-funding-cuts/7022130.article|accessdate=29 May 2018|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Political chart.svg|thumb|Chart proposed by the Political Compass Organisation extending from -10 to +10 on each axis]]
The '''political compass''' is a [[Political spectrum#Other proposed dimensions|multi-axis political model]] used by the website of the same name to label or organise political thought on two dimensions. In its selection and representation of these two dimensions, it is similar to the [[Nolan Chart]] and [[Pournelle chart]]. The term "political compass" is claimed as a trademark by the [[United Kingdom|British]] website Pace News Limited,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalcompass.org|title=The Political Compass|publisher=The Political Compass|date=11 October 2013|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which uses responses to a set of 61 propositions to rate [[political ideology]] on two axes: [[Economic policy|economic]] ([[Left-wing politics|left]]–[[Right-wing politics|right]]) and [[Social policy|social]] ([[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]]–[[Libertarianism|libertarian]]).&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; The site also includes an explanation of the two-axis system they use, a few charts which place various past and present political figures according to their estimation&lt;ref name="dt"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3642044/Time-to-start-pounding-away-at-Gordon-Brown.html "Time to start pounding away at Gordon Brown"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. Retrieved 18 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and reading lists for each of the main political orientations.

== Political model ==
The underlying theory of the political compass is that political ideology may be better measured along two separate and independent axes. The economic (left–right) axis measures one's opinion of how the [[economy]] should be run: "left" is defined as the desire for the economy to be run by a cooperative collective agency (which can mean the [[Sovereign state|state]], but can also mean a network of [[commune]]s) while "right" is defined as the desire for the economy to be left to the devices of competing individuals and organizations. The other axis (authoritarian–libertarian) measures one's political opinions in a social sense, regarding the amount of personal freedom that one would allow: "libertarianism" is defined as the belief that [[personal freedom]] should be maximised while "authoritarianism" is defined as the belief that [[authority]] should be obeyed.

A number of other [[Political spectrum#Multi-axis models|multi-axis models]] of political thought exist and some are based on similar axes to the political compass. A similar chart appeared in 1970 in ''The Floodgates of Anarchy'' by [[Albert Meltzer]] and [[Stuart Christie]] and in 1968 in the ''Rampart Journal of Individualist Thought'' by Maurice C. Bryson and William R. McDill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meltzer|first1=Albert|authorlink1=Albert Meltzer|last2=Christie|first2=Stuart|authorlink2=Stuart Christie|title=The Floodgates of Anarchy|year=1970|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/stuart-christie-albert-meltzer-the-floodgates-of-anarchy#toc11|isbn=0-900707-03-8|chapter=Party Lines and Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bryson|first=Maurice C.|last2=McDil|first2=William R.|date=Summer 1968|title=The Political Spectrum: A Bi-Dimensional Approach|url=https://www.mises.org/system/tdf/Rampart_summer1968_2.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document.|journal=Rampart Journal of Individualist Thought|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meltzer and Christie's and Bryson and McDill are pretty much the same as Nolan's, but for a change of nomenclature and the political compass is also the same, but flipped and rotated 45° anti-clockwise.

The website does not explain its scoring system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politicalcompass.org/faq#faq25|title=The Political Compass FAQ #25|website=politicalcompass.org|accessdate=8 January 2017|quote=Can you provide your scoring details[?].

[[Image:ConciergerieWomenCourt.jpg|thumb|250px|La prison de la Conciergerie.]]
'''Prisons of the Reign of Terror''' indicates a process set up under the [[Reign of Terror]], inaugurated after the lawsuit of the dantonists, then set up in a systematic manner, after the vote of the [[Law of 22 Prairial]] ([[:fr:Loi de Prairial|Loi de Prairial]]). There were several "crimes against humanity," given that the expression indicates neither rebellion nor mutiny, but a concerted plan of physical elimination of innocent prisoners without due process of the law. 

Some of these manufactured "conspiracies" considered to be criminal, in year III (1795) failed ([[:fr:Abbaye de Port-Royal de Paris|Abbaye de Port-Royal]]), others envisaged were prempted because of the events of [[Thermidorian Reaction|Thermidor 9]], and others still, found their completion 19, 21–22, and 25 messidor, 5–6, and 8 Thermidor year II (7, 9–10, 13, 23–24, and  26 July 1794). [[Maximilien Robespierre]], [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] and [[Georges Couthon|Couthon]], contrary to one ''Convention thermidorienne'', did share this: they are entirely the work of the [[Committee of General Security]], in connection with some members of the [[Committee of Public Safety]], and particularly [[Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac|Bertrand Barère]] who said to the Convention: "the committee took its measurements and in two months the prisons will be evacuated".

==Background==
Some members of [[Committee of Public Safety]] and of [[Committee of General Security]] had decided by political calculation, with various ulterior motives, to accentuate Terror by "purging" (it is their word) the prisons of Paris. Those were overflowing since the removal of the provincial revolutionary tribunals, in March 1794—the defendants stopped in the provinces were submitted in Paris, the recrudescence of the orders of arrest launched in Ile-de-France, by the Committee of general security and the "administrative slownesses" of the revolutionary Tribunal of Paris, backed-up by the paperwork, and the need for arguing the charges. 

Under the law of the 22 Prairal, the alleged conspiracies of prisoners made it possible to go more quickly, and to comb out the prisons. All the prisoners of one or the other of the many Parisian prisons, whatever the reason for their imprisonment - suspects, prevented or already judged, were concerned overall. The alleged conspiracy of [[Bicêtre Hospital|Bicêtre]], which made it possible to get rid, of more than seventy people, from 28 Prairal, until 8 Messidor, assembled by the Committee of general security, and Voulland in particular, with the downstream of [[Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac]], [[Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne]], and [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois]], was the first operation of great width assembled after the law of the 22 Pairial. 

The Osselin deputy, implied in corruption affairs, and who knew something about the corrupt practices of his former colleagues, of the Committee of general security, in particular [[Jean-Pierre-Andre Amar]], and who had avoided capital punishment four months earlier, was one of these victims, from whom they feared revelations. It is Valagnos, a prisoner condemned to irons, and on standby of the deportation who had agreed to bear false witnesses, agreed to come out to charge the defendants at the [[revolutionary Tribunal]]. This business of false conspiracy was followed by "the business" of Luxembourg, a conspiracy whose reality rested, still exclusively, on the false witnesses of individuals who, against various promises, had to deposit with the revolutionary Tribunal, and which sometimes themselves were carried out thereafter.

==Principals==
Ground after the lawsuit of Danton and its co-defendants to the prison of Luxembourg where was the ex-general [[Arthur Dillon (1750-1794)|Arthur Dillon]], [[Lucile Desmoulins]], or [[Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette]], the imaginary conspiracies, revealed and denounced by agents of the political police in the prisons of Paris, put back on an amalgam various unknown people the ones with the others under the same count of indictment - the "rebellion", to avoid dispersing in the maze of the personal cases. 

It was the Committee of general security (and in particular [[:fr:Grégoire Jagot|Jagot]] and [[Jean-Pierre-Andre Amar|Amar]] - themselves under the direction of Vadier, Barère, collot d'Hebois and Billaud-Varennes - which was given the responsibility to supervise, and execute this machiavellian plan, in partnership with [[Fouquier-Tinville]], [[:fr:Martial Joseph Armand Herman|Martial Joseph Armand Hermann]], former president of the revolutionary Tribunal now police chief, with the civil administration, and courts, and the citizens [[:fr:Marie Joseph Emmanuel Lanne|Lanne]], and Dupaumier, administrators of police force. All the principals rested on the false witnesses granted, or snatches other prisoners, sometimes of the "false prisoners" who, such Armand and Manini, were sent from prison to prison to obtain confidences or indiscretions of prisoners. 

For example the practice that certain prisoners had to meet in the cell of one of them, which allowed, if necessary, to suppose that they plotted their escape with an aim of going to cut the throat of the members of the national representatives. With the Court, it was always the same question which was put to the defendants: "Were you informed or not of a conspiracy which existed, (with Luxembourg or another prison according to the cases) and which exists there, in this moment even, and you denounced it?" On the affirmative or the negative, one passed to the next.

==First conspiracy of Luxembourg==
[[Image:LucileDesmoulins.jpg|thumb|250px|Lucile Desmoulins, supposedly conspiring in the plot of the prisons.]]
The first conspiracy of Luxembourg was assembled by part of the Committee of general security to carry out a certain number of people, supposed accessory to Hébert and Danton, without those being able to express publicly, on the true reasons of their presence to the revolutionary Tribunal. This technique which consisted in closing the mouth of the marked "defendant", with a collective offence of "conspiracy", under the law of the 22 Prairal, which dispensed with public debates. 

Joined together were Lucile Desmoulins, and the general Arthur Dillon who had sought to communicate by message from a cell with the other, were joined together and amalgamated with their alleged "accomplices": Chaumette, Gobel, Francoise Hébert, the Lécuyer general who were charged, by the Court that prisoners themselves were in danger, and died like the Laflotte diplomat, or the comte de Ferrières-Sauvebeuf.

==Second conspiracy of Luxembourg==
One of the administrators of [[:fr:Prison du Luxembourg|Prison of Luxembourg]], Wiltcherich, which had ''fabricated'' the alleged plot of [[Arthur Dillon (1750-1794)|Arthur Dillon]], and of the woman of [[Camille Desmoulins]] Lucile (5 at 13 April 1794) will cooperate again with the Committee of general security in its task with "purging" the prison of Luxembourg of its prisoners. To join together a sufficient number of denunciations and false witnesses, it made sure of collaborators subordinates among whom: *un tailor of Saint-Omer named with the rank of lieutenant of infantry, [[:fr:Pierre Joseph Boyenval|Pierre Joseph Boyenval]] that the revolutionary army had found makes indignant at it and who, imprisoned since the 20 brumaire year II, in Luxembourg, had charged [[Lucile Desmoulins]] and its co-defendants with the revolutionary Tribunal the 24 germinal year IIBoyenval was guillotine with Fouquier-Tinville in 1795;
*Beausire, lampoonist, whose wife - Nicole Leguay, baroness of Oliva - was especially famous to be mixed with [[:fr:Affaire du collier de la reine|Affair of the queen's collar]] (1784–85);
*le counter clerk or carry-key named Joseph Verney;
*an old aide-de-camp of the general Jean-François Carteaux;
*the named Mercies, a robber "good for the gibet";

The organization however was chapeautée by [[Jean-Pierre-Andre Amar]] of [[Committee of General Security]], which, for this purpose, had on the spot dispatched its Leymerie secretary who acted in concert with the administrator of Faro police force charged with the "research" in the prisons. They thus recruited a certain number of writers of denunciations, and in Luxembourg, the principalLes others named Denis-Michel Julien, Jean-Louis Benoist, old Swiss, ex-police chief of the executive council, in the department of the Eure, Lenain, Antoine Vauchelet, trader, Meunier, Amans, Letellier, Louis Baraguay d'Hilliers, and Jean-Louis All Saints' day Beausire was, of not to doubt, Pierre-Joseph Boyenval besides, the Guyard caretaker, and his assistant the Verney clerk, had order to leave it and come to his own way, to nourish it suitably and to take care that it was as often as possible in liaison with the prisoners men and women. 

Boyenval was probably the indicator more cooperative the day before of Thermidor 9, it developed a news "conspiracy" of Luxembourg where it was understood that one would sacrifice two hundred people., with an Italian named Manini who prevailed in Saint-Lazare, the ex-count of Tool bag-Sauvebeuf to La Force or Louis-Guillaume Armand which had work with Holy-Pelagie for the account of [[Dossonville]], principal agent of the Committee of general security, itself invested of quasi-unlimited capacities. Joined together "in council", the four collaborators, "brigands", consulted each other so as to draw up a list of names. This was not only the titles of nobility which appointed the prisoners but also ''resentments, whims or love''. 

Such conspired because he had refused to let one of the four men be useful in his snuffbox, such other because he was not generous with the counter clerk, a third because he was the husband of a woman that Boyenval condescended to find pleasant. This one for example had registered on the list of condemned, the one named Gant whose wife was also locked up in the prison of Luxembourg. He deposited against Gant and the evening, he was with the feet of the frightened woman; two days after, one saw him giving the arm to that from which he came to send the husband to the guillotine.'' When the number of conspirators had reached the number of 154, one stopped. 

The list was dispatched by the Committee of general security with [[Fouquier-Tinville]]. Contrary to the wishes of [[Bertrand Barère]] which wanted to consider the presumedly conspiry of the prison of Luxembourg, only once, they were distributed by Armand Hermann in three groups that were judged, after law the 22 Prairal year II - without debates and means of defense - in three meetings. In the parts given to the public prosecutor several denunciations, some not very detailed, as the others. That of Verney was to even be used for the alleged third conspiracy of Luxembourg which took place ten days later, Thermidor 4 year II. It was thus conceived:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I undersigned Joseph Verney, carry-key at the prison of Luxembourg, declare that there still exists in this house of the accomplices of the conspiracy of Dillon, Simon, Boisgelin and above the marshal's wife de Lévis (...) and that its accomplices mainly are named… the&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(a list of name follows). And he adds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I attest moreover than named Beausire, Boyenval, Amans and Vauchelet, is in the case of to attest that all these individuals are truly the accomplices of this conspiracy, even the principal agents. In Paris, 22 messidor, etc&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===First meeting – 19 messidor (7 July 1794)===
In front of [[revolutionary Tribunal]] the procedure was led with as much contempt, and absence of equity that in the preceding "affaires", in particular, that of the fifty-four accomplices of the plot of the foreigner that the persecution and execution of the red shirts [Procès et exécution des chemises rouges] to go to the torment. Fifty-nine marked were joined together on the benches of the Court where one asked them to answer by yes or no, the two questions which were asked to them: ''conspired?'' and ''be informed of a conspiracy?''. Fifty-nine people were condemned and guillotined. 

Among them, an eighty-year-old man: [[:fr:Jean-Baptiste-Augustin de Salignac|Jean-Baptist-Augustin de Salignac]], Abbot of Fénelon. Among the others appeared in particular Denis-Pierre-Jean Papillon of Ferté, above intendant of the menu of the king, Guillaume-Joseph Dupleix de Bacquencourt above intendant of Burgundy, Marc-Antoine-François-Marie Randon of the Tower (administrator of the Treasury), Louis-Joachim-Paris, [[:fr:Potier de Blancmesnil|Louis-Joachim Potier]], duc de Gesvres (compatriot of [[Louis de Saint-Just]]), Charles-Alexandre-Marc-Marcellin de Boussu de Chimay, prince d'Hénin, Aymar-Charles Nicolaï (ex-first chair Room of the Accounts) and [[:fr:Florent-Alexandre-Melchior de La Baume|Florent-Alexandre-Melchior de La Baume]], count of [[:fr:Montrevel-en-Bresse|Montrevel-en-Bresse]] [[Château de Lugny]].

===Second meeting – 21 messidor year II (July 9, 1794)===
This second meeting was composed of fifty marked. It had this remarkable thing; that two of the defendants were discharged; one of them admittedly was a 14-year-old child. On the other hand, the great architect Pierre-Louis Black-Desproux was included in this batch without same to be judged.

===Third meeting – 22 messidor year II (July 10, 1794)===
In this meeting which proceeded like the preceding ones, was present Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon - the son of the famous naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], who, when he went up to the scaffold, shouted with reproach: "I am the son of Buffon". Present also was Jacques-Raoul Caradeuc of Chalotais, son of [[Louis-Rene Caradeuc of Chalotais]], who was then known to be in a state of insanity.

==Third conspiracy of Luxembourg on Thermidor 4 year II (July 22, 1794)==
This last raid in the prison of Luxembourg involved the execution of forty-five people among whom above the duchess of Brissac, the viscountess de Noailles accompanied by her mother, the duchess of Ayen, born [[Henriette-Anne-Louise d'Aguesseau|Henriette d'Aguesseau]] and from her grandmother, the marshal's wife de Noailles, like her great-uncle [[Philippe de Noailles, duc de Mouchy]] and his wife. With them the hurdy-gurdy countess of Lachâtre, [[Louis Charles of the Mound-Ango of Flers|general of Flers]], the Roger citizen of the section of Humanity,

== Last charrettes==
From the 25 messidor year II (July 13, 1794), the figure of the daily victims never went below thirty and reached that of sixty sometimes. All the famous names of [[Ancien Régime]] were reproduced on the list of the defendants. But on these tragic lists were also day laborers, soldiers, and ploughmen.

==Conspiration of Plessis==
This project was a failure – it had there only three condemned to die – thanks to the courage of the Haly caretaker. See the letter of Gourreau quoted by Henri Wallon. See also Coittant p.&amp;nbsp;187: six indicators recruited by Benoist, which had already worked in Luxembourg, namely: Cupif, above inspector of the gardens of Tileries; Anne Cruau, shoe-maker; Charon, old domestic; Schaff, clock and watch maker; Folâtre, old ordering battalion de Bonne-Nouvelle.

==Conspiracy of the Carmelite friars==
[[Image:CarmesConventDoorstep.jpg|thumb|250px|The prison of the Carmelite friars.]]
After the prison of Luxembourg was "purged" by the process, in the same way, they applied it to other houses of detention. It was still the office of Armand Hermann who caused the denunciations. They brought in front of [[revolutionary Tribunal]] the fifty-one prisoners of [[Prison of the Carmelite friars]]. The first prisoners of the prison of the Carmelite friars were judged on Thermidor 5 year II YEAR, and forty-six of them were condemned to die on the vague denunciations of the indicators. 

Among them: [[Andre-Jean Butcher d' Argis]] (ex-lieutenant particular to Châtelet); [[François-Charles-Antoine d' Autichamps]] (canon with Notre-Dame) and brother of [[the Charles d' Autichamps|Vendean general]]; [[Louis-Marthe de Gouy d' Arsy]] (former deputy with the constituent Assembly); the general [[Alexandre François Marie de Beauharnais]]; Joachim-Charles de Soyecourt; Louis-Armand-Constantin, prince de Rohan-Montbazon; Gilles de Santerre (banking); [[Louis Rene Quentin de Richebourg de Champcenetz|Louis de Champcenetz]] (collaborator with the royalist newspaper '' [[Acts of the Apostles]] ''). The prisoners of the Carmelite friars were shown to have formed the project to escape.

==Conspiracy of Saint-Lazare==
Among the indicators of [[Prison Saint-Lazare]], the prisoners quoted: *Pierre-Athanase Pip-Desgrouettes, former lawyer, itself, on the bolster since his arrest the 2 floréal. It was implied in one of these innumerable blackmails, to the warrant for arrest near suspect rich person, have his fate was between the hands of its former Dossonville accomplice; * Augustin-Germain Jobert the Belgian, who hopelessly sought to escape the scaffold which it menaçaitil was carried out besides on the run on Thermidor 11 year II by the diligence of Barère;
*les citizens Robiquet, Coquerey, Tap and Roger the Point.
The worst, if one can say, came from Manini, who, like Boyenval in Luxembourg, made zeal, preceding the desires of its employers. Besides one closed the eyes on his "indelicacies" because it was notorious that he made "to contribute" prisoners. Several prisoners, like [[Aimee de Coigny]], Montrond, or the former deputy [[Thomas de Treil de Pardailhan]], managed against money, to be made stripe lists of prisoners denounced, little before the series of "lawsuit" in front of the revolutionary Tribunal.

===Meeting of Thermidor 6 year II – (July 24, 1794)===
The prisoners of the prison of Saint-Lazare appeared twice. It was with the first meeting, on July 25, that Fouquier-Tinville made a sadly dreadful pun. [[Marie-Louise of Laval-Montmorency]] old of seventy-two years old, abess of Montmartre, was deaf. [[Jean-Baptiste Coffinhal]], which chaired, having questioned it, she kept silence, and as Fouquier-Tinville addressed the word in his turn to him, one of marked pointed out to him that prevented did not hear. Fouquier-Tinville murmured: "They are good, they are good, we will put on the sentence that she conspired" dully. 

The writers [[André Chénier|Andre-Marie Chénier]] and [[Jean-Antoine Roucher]] also sat on the docks. With these writers appear the baron [[Frédérik de Trenck]], seventy years old, the former adviser [[Louis Valentine Goëzman de Thurn|Louis-Valentine Goesman]]. Among the twenty-four condemned one still notices the marquis Gratien de Montalembert and of Roquelaure, the duke Charles-Alexandre de Créqui de Montmorency, the count Henri-Joseph de Bourdeille, the brother Joseph Raoul.

===Meeting of Thermidor 8 year II – (July 26, 1794)===
On July 26, 1794, the countess of Mursin, born Isabelle de Pigrais, paralysed, Mrs. Jolly de Fleury born Elisabeth Dubois de Courval; above the countess of Butler; the princess of Monaco; the marquis Louis-Armand-Joseph d' Usson (seventy-four years); the count de Beausset; Desfossés; Nicaut (ex-adviser at the Parliament of Dijon); Athanase-Jean Butcher (secretary of [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]]); Dorothée de Cambon (woman of a former president of the Parliament of Toulouse); the two brothers Trudaine (Charles-Louis and Charles-Michel) and seventeen marked were condemned to death. 

A second meeting during which were considered defendants imprisoned with above [[:fr:Couvent des oiseaux|convent des oiseaux]] and at the conclusion which condemned were joined together to the twenty-two of the "conspiracy" of Saint-Lazare, changed the full number of the executions envisaged on Thermidor 8 year II, to fifty three. On the fifty three condemned, seven women declared themselves pregnant, and were sent to the old people's home of the revolutionary Tribunal for examination. Several of them, the following day, belonged to the last cart of the Terror which a famous drawing of Raffet illustrates.

==Conspiracy envisaged the day before Thermidor 9==
Among the papers found after Thermidor 9, those intended to inform the lawsuit of Fouquier-Tinville and his consorts, show that other mass executions were envisaged in the following days, while the arrests and imprisonments, were increasingly numerous. All the nobility of Neuilly-sur-Seine, Boulogne and Auteuil, had been captured in raids, and they waited to appear before the revolutionary Tribunal. They had also brought back to Paris, all the prisoners from the prisons of Chantilly, Amiens, and other places. In all, several hundred people languished in the blocked prisons. 

It was all to be carried out from the political will of Barère, probably on order of certain foreign cabinets, to deprive France of its elites, and to make a bloodless prey, to parcel out like Poland. Contrary to this, that one believed and repeated, the takeover by force of Thermidor 9 year II, in the spirit of Barère, was to make it possible to get rid of Robespierre to continue with more rigour the great project of Terror, and the destruction of the Republic. 

The "day of the dupes" on Thermidor 9, reversed the course of things, and the members of the joined committees, in the impossibility to continue their crimes, made against misfortune good heart and suddenly joined the Thermidoriens, to make accord with the opinion that, since Terror was stopped on Thermidor 10, it was well the exclusive work of Robespierre and his "accomplices", in all, a hundred men of Thermidor were carried out, without due process of the law, 10 and 11. They died instead of the hundreds of prisoners who were going to be marked, to conspire in the prisons. 

The principal houses of detention in which one still erected scaffolding, the day before the chimerical conspiracies, those of Madelonnettes Papiers were found, II, p.&amp;nbsp;417: report/ratio of Faro on a letter "found" in Madelonnettes, revealing the existence of a conspiracy; of Free Port; of Plessis where the Courlet citizen had been requested to make denunciations against his fellows-prisoner to save his head. 

Other projects were in hand again to the Carmelite friars and even in Luxembourg who still counted to a great number of prisoners lately incarcerated, Olivier Blanc, the last letter, prisons and condemned revolution, Paris, 1984. Outstanding people were planned for this butchery and in particular [[Thomas Paine]], future Mrs. de Fontenay [[Thérésa Tallien]], girl of the Cabarrus banker, it [[marquis de Sade]], [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], the general [[Lazare Hoche]], the countess of Simiane born Aglaé of Damas, friend of Fayette, the painter [[Hubert Robert]], [[Louise Contat|Miss Contat]] of the French Comedy, it [[duchess d' Orleans]], etc.

==Bilan==
The most tested prisons were Luxembourg (315 executions 19,20, and 21 messidor then on Thermidor 4), Saint-Lazare (165 executions Thermidor 6,7 and 8), Bicêtre 76 executions 28 prairal, and 8 messidor, the Carmelite friars (49 executions on Thermidor 5). All the victims of the conspiracy of the prisons were buried in [[Picpus Cemetery]].

After the fall of [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] Thermidor 9 year II (July 21, 1794) the prisons were opened and the prisoners released.

==Political consequences==
The terror falls with the [[Thermidorian Reaction]]: the responsibility for these crimes projected on the "Robespierrists".

A '''red light camera''' (short for [[red light running]] camera) is a type of [[traffic enforcement camera]] that captures an image of a vehicle which has entered an intersection in spite of the [[traffic signal]] indicating red (during the red phase).&lt;ref name=IIHS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/research/qanda/rlr.html |title=Q&amp;As: Red light cameras |date=December 2010 |work=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By automatically photographing vehicles that run red lights, the photo is evidence that assists authorities in their enforcement of traffic laws.&lt;ref name=Retting2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Retting |first1=Richard A. |last2=Ferguson |first2=Susan A. |last3=Hakkert |first3=A.

Typically, a law enforcement official will review the photographic evidence and determine whether a violation occurred. A citation is then usually mailed to the owner of the vehicle found to be in violation of the law.&lt;ref name=Priority&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/resourcecenter/teams/safety/safe_mrt_redlight.cfm |title=Priority, Market-Ready Technologies and Innovations, Red Light Cameras |publisher=FHWA.gov |accessdate=22 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420144853/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/resourcecenter/teams/safety/safe_mrt_redlight.cfm |archive-date=2011-04-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cameras are used worldwide, in countries including: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, Singapore and the United States.&lt;ref name=Small&gt;{{cite news |title=Halton adds voice to call for red-light camera traps |author=Jason Small |newspaper=The Hamilton Spectator |location=Ontario, Canada |date=18 August 1998 |page=N3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCHRP/&gt; If a proper identification cannot be made, instead of a ticket, some police departments send out a notice of violation to the owner of the vehicle, requesting identifying information so that a ticket may be issued later.

The elevated incentive to stop may mitigate [[side collision]]s. Some traffic signals have an all red duration, allowing a grace period of a few seconds before the cross-direction turns green. Some studies have confirmed more rear-end collisions where red light cameras have been used, while side collisions decreased, but the overall collision rate has been mixed. In some areas, the length of the yellow phase has been increased to provide a longer warning to accompany the red-light-running-camera. There is also concern that the international standard formula used for setting the length of the yellow phase ignores the laws of physics, which may cause drivers to inadvertently run the red phase.&lt;ref name=TTI&gt;{{cite web|quote="An additional issue is that many red light cameras use compressed video, making it impossible for the ticket holder to prove they were within the "dilemma zone".

==History==
Red light cameras were first developed in the Netherlands by Gatso.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatsometer.com/web_en/history |title=History |publisher=Gatso.com |accessdate=9 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519171308/http://www.gatsometer.com/web_en/history |archive-date=2011-05-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, red light cameras have been in use since the 1960s, and were used for traffic enforcement in Israel as early as 1969.&lt;ref name=Retting2/&gt; The first red light camera system was introduced in 1965, using tubes stretched across the road to detect the violation and subsequently trigger the camera. One of the first developers of these red light camera systems was [[Gatso|Gatsometer BV]].&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

The cameras first received serious attention in the United States in the 1980s following a highly publicized crash in 1982, involving a red-light runner who collided with an 18-month-old girl in a [[baby transport|stroller]] (or "push-chair") in [[New York City]].

==Operation==
Red light cameras are typically installed in protective metal boxes attached to poles (different from the radar guns carried by police officers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/publications/workshops/2006/camera.pdf |title=An Analysis of a Red-Light Camera Program in the City of Milwaukee |last1=Kriz |first1=Karyn |last2=Moran |first2=Christian |last3=Regan |first3=Molly |date=Spring 2006 |work=Lafollette.Wisc.edu |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison |page=5 |accessdate=22 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927180117/http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/publications/workshops/2006/camera.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at intersections,&lt;ref name=SanDiego&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiego.gov/engineering-cip/services/public/rlphoto/faq.shtml |title=Red Light Photo Safety Program: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=SanDiego.gov |accessdate=16 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106124229/http://www.sandiego.gov/engineering-cip/services/public/rlphoto/faq.shtml |archivedate=6 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are often specifically chosen due to high numbers of crashes and/or red-light-running violations.&lt;ref name=Michael/&gt; Red light camera systems typically employ two closely spaced inductive loops embedded in the pavement just before the limit line, to measure the speed of vehicles. Using the speed measured, the system predicts if a particular vehicle will not be able to stop before entering the intersection, and takes two photographs of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://highwayrobbery.net/redlightcamslinksref.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions, No. 27 |publisher=highwayrobbery.net |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first photo shows the vehicle just before it enters the intersection, with the light showing red, and the second photo, taken a second or two later, shows the vehicle when it is in the intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atsol.com/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |work=American Traffic Solutions, Inc. |accessdate=18 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126211608/http://www.atsol.com/faq.html |archive-date=2011-11-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Details that may be recorded by the camera system (and later presented to the vehicle owner) include: the date and time, the location, the vehicle speed, and the amount of time elapsed since the light turned red and the vehicle passed into the intersection. The event is captured as a series of photographs or a video clip, or both, depending on the technology used, which shows the vehicle before it enters the intersection on a red light signal and its progress through the intersection.&lt;ref name=SanDiego/&gt; The data and images, whether digital or developed from film, are sent to the relevant law enforcement agency. There, the information is typically reviewed by a law enforcement official or police department clerk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://highwayrobbery.net/redlightcamslinksref.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions, No. 36 |publisher=highwayrobbery.net |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who determines if a violation occurred and, if so, approves issuing a citation to the vehicle owner,&lt;ref name=SanDiego/&gt; who may challenge the citation.&lt;ref name=Priority/&gt;

Studies have shown that 38% of violations occur within 0.25 seconds of the light turning red and 79% within one second. A few red light camera systems allow a "grace period" of up to half a second for drivers who pass through the intersection just as the light turns red.&lt;ref name=IIHS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/research/qanda/rlr.html |title=Red Light Camera's Q&amp;A |work=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio and Georgia introduced a statute requiring that one second be added to the standard yellow time of any intersection that has a red light camera, which has led to an 80% reduction in tickets since its introduction. New Jersey has the strictest yellow timing provisions in the country as a result of concerns that cameras would be used to generate revenue; they have a statute specifying that the yellow time for an intersection that has a red light camera must be based on the speed at which 85% of the road's traffic moves rather than be based on the road's actual speed limit.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, where red light cameras are installed, signs are erected to warn drivers that cameras are present, with the aim of educating drivers to stop for signals.&lt;ref name=Delfino&gt;{{cite news |title=Warning for red light jumpers |author=Brendan Delfino |newspaper=The South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong |date=27 September 1996 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of red light cameras in Hong Kong doubled in May 2004, and digital red light cameras were introduced at intersections identified by the police and transport department as having the most violations and greatest risk. The digital cameras were introduced to further deter red-light running. As added assistance to drivers, some of the camera posts were painted orange so that drivers could see them more easily.&lt;ref name=Michael/&gt; By 2006, Hong Kong had 96 red light cameras in operation.&lt;ref name=HongKong&gt;{{cite news |title=Red light jumping accidents fall in Hong Kong |newspaper=Xinhua General News Service |date=23 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016 this number had risen to 195.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New red light cameras in operation today|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201603/16/P201603160311.htm|publisher=Hong Kong Government|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notice of traffic violation====
In many California police departments, when a positive identification cannot be made, the registered owner of the vehicle will be mailed a ''notice of traffic violation'' instead of a real ticket. Also known as "snitch tickets," these notices are used to request identifying information about the driver of the vehicle during the alleged violation. Because these notices have not been filed at court, they carry no legal weight and the registered owner is under no obligation to respond. In California, a genuine ticket will bear the name and address of the local branch of the Superior Court and direct the recipient to contact that court. In contrast, a ''notice of traffic violation'' generated by the police will omit court information, using statements like "This is not a notice to appear" and "Do not forward this information to the Court."&lt;ref name="Police Going Too Far..."&gt;http://www.highwayrobbery.net [http://highwayrobbery.net/redlightcamsticket.htm#Fakes "Police Going Too Far..."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="losangeles.cbslocal.com"&gt;David Goldstein, CBS Television, Los Angeles [http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2011/02/13/goldstein-investigation-are-police-tricking-people-into-paying-snitch-tickets/ "Are police tricking people into paying Snitch Tickets?"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Right To Remain Silent"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almanacnews.com/news/show_story.php?id=10022 |title=The Right To Remain Silent |publisher=almanacnews.com |accessdate=18 November 2011 |date=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="handelonthelaw.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handelonthelaw.com/home/law-articles/traffic-moving-violations-articles/red-light-camera-tickets---something-consumers-should-know.html |title=Something Every Consumer Should Know |publisher=HandelontheLaw.com |accessdate=18 November 2011 |date=27 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204183719/http://www.handelonthelaw.com/home/law-articles/traffic-moving-violations-articles/red-light-camera-tickets---something-consumers-should-know.html |archive-date=2012-12-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies and politics==

A report in 2003 by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) examined studies from the previous 30 years in Australia, the UK, Singapore, and the US, and concluded that red light cameras "improve the overall safety of intersections where they are used."&lt;ref name=NCHRP/&gt; While the report states that evidence is not conclusive (partly due to flaws in the studies), the majority of studies show a reduction in angle crashes, a smaller increase in rear-end crashes, with some evidence of a "spillover" effect of reduced red light running to other intersections within a jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=NCHRP/&gt; These findings are similar to a 2005 [[meta analysis]], which compared the results of 10 controlled before-after studies of red light cameras in the US, Australia, and Singapore. The analysis stated that the studies showed a reduction in crashes (up to almost 30%) in which there were injuries, however, evidence was less conclusive for a reduction in total collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003862.html |title=Red light cameras for the prevention of road traffic crashes

Amongst the many researched safety benefits of installing RLCs, few studies have examined drivers' behavior change in relation to red-light cameras showing that at these intersections drivers tended to react quicker to a yellow light change when stopping.&lt;ref name="Fatemeh Baratian-Ghorghi 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=1287560 |title=Impacts of Automated Red Light Running Enforcement Cameras on Driver Behavior |author=Timothy Jordan Gates|author2= Peter Tarmo Savolainen|author3= Honey-Um Maria |year=2014 |work=Transportation Research Board |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of this change could be the slight decline in the intersection capacity.&lt;ref name=Baratian/&gt;
In terms of location-specific studies, in Singapore a study from 2003 found that there was "a substantial drop" in red light violations at intersections with red light cameras. In particular the study found that drivers were encouraged to stop more readily in areas with red light cameras in use.&lt;ref name=Lum/&gt; A report from civic administrators in [[Saskatchewan]] in 2001, when considering red light camera use, referred to studies in the Netherlands and Australia that found a 40% decrease in red light violations and 32% decrease in right-angle crashes where red light cameras were installed.&lt;ref name=Star&gt;{{cite news |title=Camera logic failed to click|newspaper=The Star Phoenix |location=Saskatoon, Saskatchewan |date=26 January 2001 |page=A14 |at=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the introduction of red light cameras in Western Australia, the number of serious right-angle crashes decreased by 40%, according to an article from the ''Canberra Times''.&lt;ref name=Clack/&gt; In an article from the [[Xinhua General News Service]], the Hong Kong transport department reported that in 2006 the monthly average number of crashes due to red light violations fell 25% and the number of people injured in these crashes decreased by 30%, following an increase in the number of red light cameras in use.&lt;ref name=HongKong/&gt;

In the U.S. and Canada, a number of studies have examined whether red light cameras produce a safety benefit. A 2005 study by the U.S. [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) suggests red light cameras reduce dangerous right-angle crashes.&lt;ref name=Council&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/05048/index.cfm |title=Safety Evaluation of Red Light Cameras |author=Forrest M.

IIHS research on the safety effects of red light cameras has also been criticized as biased and methodologically flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/02q3/rear-end_crashes_go_up_after_red-light_cameras_go_in-column|title=Rear-End Crashes Go Up After Red-Light Cameras Go In|author=PATRICK BEDARD|date=1 September 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all studies have been favorable to the use of red light cameras.

The [[National Motorists Association]] opposes red light cameras on the grounds that the use of these devices raises legal issues and violates the privacy of citizens.

===Canada and Europe===

In Norway, Spain, and the Netherlands, a postal survey in 2003 showed acceptance of the use of red light cameras for traffic enforcement.&lt;ref name=Lum/&gt; For some groups, the enforcement of traffic laws is considered the main reason for using the red light cameras. For example, a report from civic administrators in Canada's Saskatoon in 2001 described the cameras as "simply an enforcement tool used to penalize motorists that fail to stop for red traffic signals."&lt;ref name=Star/&gt;

{{As of|2016|12 |df=US}} [[Arizona]], [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Maine]], [[Mississippi]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Jersey]], [[South Carolina]], [[South Dakota]], [[Utah]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Wisconsin]] have enacted various prohibitions on red light, speed or other photo enforcement camera uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/laws/automated_enforcement/enforcementtable?topicName=Red%20light%20running#tableData|title=States using red light and speed cameras|website=www.iihs.org|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions or conditions exist in additional states; the New Mexico Department of Transportation, for example, has asserted the right to restrict or prohibit red light cameras on state highways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nmshtd.state.nm.us/upload/contents/436/Red%20Light%20Camera%20Ban%20%28ver%203b%29.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929035426/http://www.nmshtd.state.nm.us/upload/contents/436/Red%20Light%20Camera%20Ban%20(ver%203b).pdf |archive-date=2011-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While red light cameras may not be prohibited in other regions, they may have some restrictions on their use. In some jurisdictions, the law says that the camera needs to obtain a photo of the driver's face in order for the citation issued for running the red light to be valid. This is the case in California and Colorado&lt;ref name=Enforcement/&gt; where the red light cameras are set up to take a series of photographs, including one of the driver's face.&lt;ref name=Daly&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dalycity.org/City_Hall/Departments/police_department/red_light_cameras/howdoesitwork.htm |title=How does it work? |publisher=DalyCity.org |accessdate=19 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121052058/http://www.dalycity.org/City_Hall/Departments/police_department/red_light_cameras/howdoesitwork.htm |archive-date=2011-01-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In California, state law assesses a demerit point against a driver who runs a red light,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stopredlightrunning.com/pdfs/WEBONLY_Red%20Light%20Book.pdf |title=Focus On Safety |year=2007 |work=Stop Red Light Running |page=66 |format=PDF |accessdate=9 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906104731/http://www.stopredlightrunning.com/pdfs/WEBONLY_Red%20Light%20Book.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the need to identify the actual violator has led to the creation of a unique investigatory tool, the fake "ticket."&lt;ref name="Police Going Too Far..."/&gt;&lt;ref name="losangeles.cbslocal.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Right To Remain Silent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="handelonthelaw.com"/&gt; Groups opposing the use of red light cameras have argued that where the cameras are not set up to identify the vehicle driver, owner liability issues are raised. It is perceived by some that the owner of the vehicle is unfairly penalized by being considered liable for red-light violations although they may not have been the driver at the time of the offense.&lt;ref name=Small/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motorists.org/red-light-cameras/objections |title=NMA Objections To Red-Light Cameras |publisher=National Motorists Association |accessdate=20 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718085600/http://www.motorists.org/red-light-cameras/objections |archivedate=18 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most jurisdictions the liability for red light violations is a civil offense, rather than a criminal citation, issued upon the vehicle owner—similar to a parking ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stopredlightrunning.com/pdfs/WEBONLY_Red%20Light%20Book.pdf |title=Focus On Safety |year=2007 |work=Stop Red Light Running |page=67 |format=PDF |accessdate=9 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906104731/http://www.stopredlightrunning.com/pdfs/WEBONLY_Red%20Light%20Book.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of owner liability has been addressed in the US courts, with a ruling in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in 2007, which agreed with a lower court when it found that the presumption of liability of the owners of vehicles issued citations does not violate due process rights.&lt;ref name=AgomoFenty&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Agomo v. Fenty |vol=916 |reporter= |opinion=181 |pinpoint= |court=District of Columbia Court of Appeals |date=1 February 2007 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8575727632696898671&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr |quote="Appellants argue that the method of assessing liability preliminarily to the registered owner of the car conflicts with the statutory framework set forth in D.C.Code § 50-2302.06(a), which requires that the District prove a moving violation by clear and convincing evidence, and that this "presumption of liability" violates their due process rights. ... We hold that there exists no constitutional violation as asserted and affirm."}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling was supported by a 2009 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in which it was held that issuing citations to vehicle owners (or lessees) is constitutional. The court stated that it also encourages drivers to be cautious in lending their vehicles to others.&lt;ref name=IdrisChicago1&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Idris v. City of Chicago, Illinois |vol= |reporter= |opinion=08-1363 |pinpoint= |court=7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals |date=5 January 2009 |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1118906.html
|quote="Fining a car's owner is rational for the same reasons:  Owners will take more care when lending their cars, and often they can pass the expense on to the real wrongdoer." "It is enough to say that photographs are at least as reliable as live testimony, that the due process clause allows administrative decisions to be made on paper (or photographic) records without regard to the hearsay rule, see Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971), and that the procedures Chicago uses are functionally identical to those it uses to adjudicate parking tickets, a system sustained in Van Harken v. Chicago, 103 F.3d 1346 (7th Cir.1997). Affirmed."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that red light cameras violate the privacy of citizens,&lt;ref name=Motorists/&gt; has also been addressed in the US courts. According to a 2009 ruling by the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals, "no one has a fundamental right to run a red light or avoid being seen by a camera on a public street."&lt;ref name=IdrisChicago2&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Idris v. City of Chicago, Illinois |vol= |reporter= |opinion=08-1363 |pinpoint= |court=7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals |date=5 January 2009 |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1118906.html
|quote=no one has a fundamental right to run a red light or avoid being seen by a camera on a public street.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, cameras only take photographs or video when a vehicle has run a red light and, in most states, the camera does not photograph the driver or the occupants of the vehicle.&lt;ref name=IIHS/&gt;

In most areas, red light enforcement cameras are installed and maintained by private firms.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite news |title=With Cameras on the Corner, Your Ticket Is in the Mail |author=Jonathan Miller |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/technology/circuits/06came.html?_r=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=6 January 2005 |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Washington&gt;{{cite news |title=Toss your ticket |url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/01/toss-your-ticket/ |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=1 July 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Farley&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/2008/feb/03/cbr---red-light-cameras-red-light-cameras-to-get/#ixzz0X0MADxNk |title=Smile, Bremerton!

There have been many instances where cities in the US have been found to have too-short yellow-light intervals at some intersections where red light cameras have been installed. In Tennessee, 176 drivers were refunded for fines paid after it was discovered that the length of the yellow was too short for that location, and motorists were caught running the light in the first second of the red phase.&lt;ref name=TFP&gt;{{cite news |title=Quick light leads to refunds for 176 drivers |author=Brian Lazenby |url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/mar/13/quick-light-leads-refunds-176-drivers/ |newspaper=Chattanooga Times Free Press |date=13 March 2008 |accessdate=7 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110101939/http://timesfreepress.com/news/2008/mar/13/quick-light-leads-refunds-176-drivers/ |archive-date=2011-01-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In California, a combined total of 7603 tickets were refunded or dismissed by the cities of Bakersfield, Costa Mesa, East LA, San Carlos, and Union City, because of too-short yellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highwayrobbery.net/redlightcamscameras.htm |title=Camera Towns |publisher=highwayrobbery.net |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although national guidelines addressing the length of traffic signals are available,&lt;ref name=Manual&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/ |title=Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices |work=Federal Highway Administration |accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; traffic signal phase times are determined by the government employees of the city, county or state for that signalized location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lincoln.ne.gov/city/pworks/engine/traffic/signal/faq.htm |title=City of Lincoln Traffic Signals Frequently Asked Questions |work=Lincoln.ne.gov |publisher=City of Lincoln, Nebraska |accessdate=17 January 2011 |quote=The City of Lincoln follows City policies and Nebraska State Law, which requires us to follow the national guidelines outlined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hvceo.org/transport/signal_coordination.php |title=Traffic Signal Coordination Handbook |work=Housatonic Valley Council of Elected Officials |publisher=HVCEO Transportation Planning |accessdate=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some states set jurisdiction-wide constant durations for yellow-light intervals, a new standard is taking hold. States are required to adopt the 2009 National Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) as their legal state standard for traffic-control devices since 2011.&lt;ref name=Manual/&gt; These standards require engineering practices to be used to set yellow-light-timing durations at individual intersections and or corridors.&lt;ref name=FederalReg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/11/30/2010-29587/manual-on-uniform-traffic-control-devices-mutcd-compliance-dates |title=Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) Compliance Dates |date=30 November 2010 |work=Federal Register |accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For guidance to state authorities, MUTCD states yellow lights should have a minimum duration of 3 seconds and a maximum duration of 6 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/pdfs/2009/part4.pdf |title=Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) 2009 Edition |year=2009 |work=Federal Highway Administration |format=PDF |page=489 |accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deadline for compliance is 2014.&lt;ref name=FederalReg/&gt; In the US, if any part of a driver's vehicle has already passed into the intersection when the signal turns red, a violation is not generated. A ticket is only issued if the vehicle enters the intersection while the light is red.&lt;ref name=SanDiego/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/files/police/PhotoradarFAQ.pdf |title=Photo Enforcement Frequently Asked Questions |work=City of Tucson, Tucson Police Department |accessdate=3 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516040449/http://cms3.tucsonaz.gov/files/police/PhotoradarFAQ.pdf |archive-date=2011-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives attempting to prohibit red light cameras on federally funded highways and in the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|113|HR|5755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In 2010, it was revealed that the municipality of [[Segrate]], [[Italy]], two nearby traffic lights had been synchronized such that drivers were coerced to either break the [[speed limit]] or pass during the red light. This was investigated as a deliberate fraud to increase the income from tickets. It took months before the machines were eventually dismantled by the [[Guardia di Finanza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewspaper.com/news/31/3128.asp |title=Italy: Prosecution Advances in Red Light Camera Fraud Scandal |date=3 May 2010 |publisher=theNewspaper.com |accessdate=2011-03-01 |quote=Mayor Adriano Alessandrini is now accused of shortening the duration of yellow lights to boost the profits of the red light camera program.

==Alternatives==
A red light camera is not the only countermeasure against red-light running. Others include increasing the visibility distance and [[wikt:conspicuity|conspicuity]] of the traffic light so it is more likely to attract the driver's attention in time for him or her to stop,&lt;ref name="Albuquerque_Final"&gt;[http://isr.unm.edu/index.php/download_file/-/view/468/ "City of Albuquerque Red Light Camera Study Final Report"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113040633/http://isr.unm.edu/index.php/download_file/-/view/468/ |date=2010-11-13 }}, UNM.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAA_Michigan"&gt;[http://www.motorists.org/red-light-cameras/aaa-michigan.pdf "AAA Michigan Program Prevents Crashes, One Intersection at a Time"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927152057/http://www.motorists.org/red-light-cameras/aaa-michigan.pdf |date=2011-09-27 }} (PDF), motorists.org.&lt;/ref&gt; re-timing lights so drivers will encounter fewer red ones,&lt;ref name=Albuquerque_Final/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.motorists.org/red-light-cameras/alternatives |title=Alternatives to Red Light Cameras |access-date=2011-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526113014/http://www.motorists.org/red-light-cameras/alternatives |archive-date=2011-05-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing the duration of the yellow light between the green and the red,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tti.tamu.edu/documents/0-4196-2.pdf "Development of Guidelines for Identifying and Treating Locations with a Red-Light-Running Problem"] (PDF), tamu.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.motorists.org/red-light-cameras/timing-myths |title=Yellow Light Timing Myths |access-date=2011-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811074122/http://www.motorists.org/red-light-cameras/timing-myths |archive-date=2011-08-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; adding a "clearance" phase to the intersection's traffic signals, during which all directions have a red light.&lt;ref name=AAA_Michigan/&gt; It has been posited that the regulatory minimum yellow duration has been decreased over the years, that this is a cause of the increase in red-light running, and that the latter countermeasures amount to a reversion to earlier, longer regulated yellow-light durations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/reports/rlcreport5.asp "The Red Light Running Crisis: Is It Intentional?"], thenewspaper.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Placa remença Amer.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating the 500th anniversary of the ''remences''' acceptance of King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]]'s mediation between the ''remences'' and the feudal lords. (Located in [[Amer, Selva|Amer]] monastery, where the arbitration occurred.)]]

'''Remensa''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Remença'') was a Catalan mode of [[serf]]dom. Those who were serfs under this mode are properly ''pagesos de remença'' (''pagesos'' meaning "peasants"); they are often (though not quite correctly) referred to simply as ''remences'' (singular ''remença'').

The Catalan term ''remença'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''redementia'' and emphasizes the possibility of redemption from [[Slavery|servitude]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elalmanaque.com/diciembre/15-12-eti.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040810164842/http://www.elalmanaque.com/diciembre/15-12-eti.htm |date=August 10, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The severity of this way of life led to rebellions by the remensa peasants in 1462 and 1485 known as the [[War of the Remences]]. After the second revolt, King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] issued the ''[[Sentencia de Guadalupe]]'' (1486), outlawing the more severe abuses of the oppressive [[evil customs]] and allowing remensa peasants to be redeemed by a payment of 60 [[Solidus (coin)#France|sous]] per household, leaving a rural society that was still [[feudalism|feudal]] in character, but significantly reformed.

The '''Richardson Institute for Peace Studies''' was the first [[Peace and conflict studies|peace &amp; conflict]] research centre in the UK and one of the first in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/ppr/research/research-centres/richardson-institute/ |title= Department of Politics, Philosophy, and Religion: Research Centres |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the Department of Politics, Philosophy, and Religion at [[Lancaster University]], where its members publish research, hold lectures and workshops, and run academic outreach programmes.

==History==
The Richardson Institute began as an independent organisation, the '''Lancaster Peace Research Centre''', in the [[North of England]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=EBzxsURb4-cC&amp;q=richardson+institute#v=snippet&amp;q=richardson%20institute&amp;f=false |work= Journal of Peace Research |title= Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, and Conflict |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/51/2/145.full.pdf |work= Journal of Peace Research |title= Peace Research – Just the Study of War?|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was incorporated first into the Politics Department at Lancaster University, and then in 1969 into a branch of the Conflict Research Society at the [[University of Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://conflictresearchsociety.org/history/  |title= The Conflict Research Society: History |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/n1879/pdf/book.pdf?referer=1879  |title= War, Strategy, and History |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There the Centre was renamed the '''Richardson Institute for Conflict and Peace Research''' in honour of the polymath and pacifist [[Lewis Fry Richardson]], and was moved to 158 North Gower St, London, which it shared with the [[Women’s Research and Resources Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb106-7pac  |title= Papers of Pat Caplan |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the Institute not only published academic papers, but also released an animated film about the nature of human communication in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/search~S2?/dAnimated+films./danimated+films/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=danimated+films+united+states&amp;7%2C%2C23 |work= State Library of New South Wales |title= Communicate or Else |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 1978, with funding from the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]], the Institute returned to Lancaster University as an autonomous body of the Politics Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bisa.ac.uk/files/BISA%20News/Autumn_1978_Issue_9.pdf |work= British International Studies Association Newsletter |title= Autumn 1978, No.9 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There its activities diversified into undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, ultimately leading to the creation of a [[studentship]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alumni.lancs.ac.uk/document.doc?id=14 |work= Steps |title= Summer 2007 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its early [[Minor (academic)|minor course]] in conflict &amp; peace research proved particularly popular, and the Institute became renowned for lecturing in "unashamedly [[Behavioural sciences|behavioural]]" models of social science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bisa.ac.uk/files/BISA%20News/Spring_1980_Issue_13.pdf |work= British International Studies Association Newsletter |title= Spring 1980 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the members of the Institute consolidated their work by publishing ''A Reader in Peace Studies'', a basic text that became set reading for many introductory peace studies courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol3_1/Harris.htm |title= A Portrait of University Peace Studies in North America and Western Europe at the End of the Millennium |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this new activity, the Institute was given the more general trade name of the '''Richardson Institute for Peace Studies'''.

As the Institute shared more of the Politics Department’s day-to-day teaching responsibilities, its other activities declined. With funding from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]], the Institute was re-launched in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.ref.ac.uk/DownloadFile/EnvironmentTemplate/PDF?subId=1764 |work= Research Excellence Framework 2014 |title= Lancaster University: Theology and Religious Studies |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 it began the Richardson Institute Internship Programme, a year-long, multidisciplinary research placement with such partners as the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], and in 2016 it opened a course in the [[Political theology|political theology of peace]] as the first in a number of [[distance learning]] modules on positive politics. The Institute also hosts an annual peace lecture series and runs a film club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/centres/richinst/ |title= www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/centres/richinst |accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its present aim is to become an international partner of choice for universities and to improve the public understanding of peace. Since 2012 the Institute has published on such diverse topics as [[Indo-Pak relations]], sexuality in the [[Anglican Church]], and maritime [[Cyberwarfare|cyber operations]], and the [[ESRC]] has rated its research as outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/ppr/research/research-centres/richardson-institute/#publications |title= Richardson Institute Publications |accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/clippings/richardson-institute-research-rated-as-outstanding-by-the-esrc(336a53aa-b8e1-4a7e-aae9-c063dedce4a0).html |work= Lancaster University Research Directory |title= Richardson Institute Research Rated as 'Outstanding' by the ESRC |accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Sanhedrin in session 2013-12-25 00-59.jpg|thumb|The ''Sanhedrin'', from an 1883 encyclopedia]]
{{judaism}}
The '''Sanhedrin''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]]: סנהדרין; [[Greek language|Greek]]: Συνέδριον,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/strongs.pl?strongs=4892|title=Greek Lexicon :: G4892 (KJV)|work=Blue Letter Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[synedrion]]'', "sitting together," hence "[[Deliberative assembly|assembly]]" or "council") were assemblies of either twenty-three or seventy-one [[rabbi]]s appointed to sit as a [[tribunal]] in every city in the ancient [[Land of Israel]]. 

There were two classes of rabbinical courts called Sanhedrin, the ''Great Sanhedrin'' and the ''Lesser Sanhedrin''. A lesser Sanhedrin of 23 judges was appointed to each city, but there was to be only one Great Sanhedrin of 71 judges, which among other roles acted as the Supreme Court, taking appeals from cases decided by lesser courts. In general usage, "The Sanhedrin" without qualifier normally refers to the Great Sanhedrin, which was composed of the ''[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]]'', who functioned as head or representing president, and was a member of the court; the ''[[Av Beit Din]]'' or chief of the court, who was second to the ''nasi''; and sixty-nine general members (''Mufla''). 

In the [[Second Temple period]], the Great Sanhedrin met in the Temple in [[Jerusalem]], in a building called the [[Hall of Hewn Stones]]. The Great Sanhedrin convened every day except [[Jewish Holidays|festivals]] and the [[sabbath]] day ([[Shabbat]]). 

After the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] and the failure of the [[Bar Kokhba Revolt]], the Great Sanhedrin moved to Galilee, which became part of the Roman province of [[Syria Palaestina]]. In this period the Sanhedrin was sometimes referred as the ''Galilean Patriarchate'' or ''Patriarchate of Palaestina'', being the governing legal body of Galilean Jewry. In the late 200s, to avoid persecution, the name "Sanhedrin" was dropped and its decisions were issued under the name of ''Beit HaMidrash'' (house of learning). The last universally binding decision of the Great Sanhedrin appeared in 358 CE, when the [[Hebrew Calendar]] was abandoned. The Great Sanhedrin was finally disbanded in 425 CE after continued persecution by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

Over the centuries, there have been attempts to revive the institution, such as the [[Grand Sanhedrin]] convened by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and modern attempts in [[Israel]].

==History==
===Precursors===
In the [[Hebrew Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;(Exodus 18:21–22) (Numbers 11:16–17) (Numbers 11:24–25) (Deuteronomy 1:15–18) (Deuteronomy 17:9–12)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses]] and the Israelites were commanded by God to establish courts of judges who were given full authority over the people of Israel, who were commanded by God to obey every word the judges instructed and every law they established. Judges in ancient Israel were the religious leaders and [[Rabbis|teachers]] of the nation of Israel. The [[Mishnah]]&lt;ref&gt;The ''Mishnah'' (Sanhedrin 1:6)&lt;/ref&gt; arrives at the number twenty-three based on an [[Exegesis|exegetical]] derivation: it must be possible for a "[[minyan|community]]" to vote for both conviction and exoneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse-lb||Numbers|35:24–5|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum size of a "community" is 10 men&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew term "community" appears in {{Bibleverse-lb||Numbers|14:27|HE}}; i.e., the 10 spies who had spread a bad report about the land, thus a "community" is 10 men.&lt;/ref&gt; (10 vs 10). One more is required to achieve a majority (11 vs 10), but a simple majority cannot convict,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse-lb||Exodus|23:2|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so an additional judge is required (12 vs 10). Finally, a court should not have an even number of judges to prevent deadlocks; thus 23 (12 vs 10 and 1). This court dealt with only religious matters.

===Early Sanhedrin===
The Hasmonean court in the [[Land of Israel]], presided over by [[Alexander Jannaeus]], king of Judea until 76 BCE, followed by his wife, was called ''Synhedrion'' or ''Sanhedrin.''&lt;ref name="Wanderings p. 191"&gt;''[[Wanderings: Chaim Potok's History of the Jews]]'', Chaim Potok, Knopf, New York, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact nature of this early Sanhedrin is not clear. It may have been a body of sages or priests, or a political, legislative and judicial institution. The first historical record of the body was during the administration of [[Aulus Gabinius]], who, according to Josephus, organized five ''synedra'' in 57 BCE as Roman administration was not concerned with religious affairs unless sedition was suspected.&lt;ref&gt;Mantel, Hugo. (1972) "Sanhedrin".  in Encyclopaedia Judaica. Jerusalem: Macmillan. 14, p. 836&lt;/ref&gt; Only after the destruction of the Second Temple was the Sanhedrin made up only of sages.&lt;ref name="Wanderings p. 191"/&gt;

===Herodian and early Roman rule===
The first historic mention of a ''Synhedrion'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Συνέδριον) occurs in the [[Psalms of Solomon]] (XVII:49), a Jewish religious book written in Greek.

A ''Synhedrion'' is mentioned 22 times in the [[Greek New Testament]], including in the Gospels in relation to the [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|trial of Jesus]], and in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'', which mentions a ″Great Synhedrion″ in chapter 5 where rabbi [[Gamaliel]] appeared, and also in chapter 7 in relation to the stoning death of [[Saint Stephen]].

The Talmud tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] (IV:2) states that the Sanhedrin was to be recruited from the following sources: former High Priests, representatives of the 24 priestly castes, scribes, doctors of the law, and representatives of the most prominent families (those whose daughters were allowed to marry priests).

In the Second Temple period, the Great Sanhedrin met in the [[Hall of Hewn Stones]] in the Temple in [[Jerusalem]]. The court convened every day except [[Jewish Holidays|festivals]] and the [[sabbath]] day ([[Shabbat]]).

===During Jewish–Roman Wars===
After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the Sanhedrin was re-established in [[Yavneh]] with reduced authority. The seat of the Patriarchate moved to [[Usha (ancient)|Usha]] under the presidency of [[Shimon ben Gamliel|Gamaliel II]] in 80 CE. In 116 it moved back to Yavneh, and then again back to Usha.

===After Bar Kokhba Revolt===
[[File:Ancient Galilee.jpg|thumb|[[Galilee]] in [[Late Antiquity|late antiquity]].]]
Rabbinic texts indicate that following the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], southern [[Galilee]] became the seat of rabbinic learning in the [[Land of Israel]]. This region was the location of the court of the Patriarch which was situated first at [[Usha (city)|Usha]], then at [[Bet Shearim]], later at [[Sepphoris]] and finally at [[Tiberias]].&lt;ref name="LightstoneReligion2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jack N. Lightstone|author2=Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion|title=Mishnah and the social formation of the early Rabbinic Guild: a socio-rhetorical approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s42kv4NGBU4C&amp;pg=PA192|accessdate=18 July 2011|date=13 May 2002|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=978-0-88920-375-4|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Sanhedrin moved in 140 to [[Shefa-'Amr|Shefaram]] under the presidency of [[Shimon ben Gamliel II]], and to [[Beit Shearim]] and [[Tzippori|Sepphoris]] in 163, under the presidency of [[Judah I]]. Finally, it moved to [[Tiberias]] in 193, under the presidency of [[Gamaliel III]] (193–230) ben [[Judah haNasi]], where it became more of a consistory, but still retained, under the presidency of [[Judah II]] (230–270), the power of excommunication.

During the presidency of [[Gamaliel IV]] (270–290), due to Roman persecution, it dropped the name Sanhedrin; and its authoritative decisions were subsequently issued under the name of ''[[Yeshiva|Beth HaMidrash]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In the year 363, the emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] (r. 355–363 CE), an apostate from  Christianity, ordered the Temple rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 23.1.2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The project's failure has been ascribed to the [[Galilee earthquake of 363]], and to the [[Jew]]s' ambivalence about the project. Sabotage is a possibility, as is an accidental fire. Divine intervention was the common view among Christian historians of the time.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;See [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/julian-jews.html "Julian and the Jews 361–363 CE"] and [http://www.gibsoncondo.com/~david/convert/history.html "Julian the Apostate and the Holy Temple"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051020130904/http://www.gibsoncondo.com/~david/convert/history.html |date=2005-10-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a reaction against Julian's pro-Jewish stance, the later emperor [[Theodosius I]] (r. 379–392 CE) forbade the Sanhedrin to assemble and declared [[Semicha|ordination]] illegal. Capital punishment was prescribed for any Rabbi who received ordination, as well as complete destruction of the town where the ordination occurred.&lt;ref name="A History"&gt;''A History of the Jewish People'', by Hayim Ben-Sasson, Harvard University Press (October 15, 1985), {{ISBN|978-0-674-39731-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since the [[Hebrew calendar]] was based on witnesses' testimony, which had become far too dangerous to collect, rabbi [[Hillel II]] recommended change to a mathematically based calendar that was adopted at a clandestine, and maybe final, meeting in 358 CE. This marked the last universal decision made by the Great Sanhedrin.

[[Gamaliel VI]] (400–425) was the Sanhedrin's last president. With his death in 425, Theodosius II outlawed the title of [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]], the last remains of the ancient Sanhedrin. An imperial decree of 426 diverted the patriarchs' tax (''post excessum patriarchorum'') into the imperial treasury.&lt;ref name="A History" /&gt; The exact reason for the abrogation of the patriarchate is not clear,&lt;ref name="LangeGerber1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Robert Michael De Lange|author2=Jane S. Gerber|title=The illustrated history of the Jewish people|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5ntAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=18 July 2011|date=15 October 1997|publisher=Harcourt Brace|isbn=978-0-15-100302-0|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Gamaliel VI, the last holder of the office who had been for a time elevated by the emperor to the rank of [[prefect]],&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911attribution"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Jews|accessdate=18 July 2011|year=1911|page=403|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; may have fallen out with the imperial authorities.&lt;ref name="LangeGerber1997"/&gt; Thereafter, Jews were gradually excluded from holding public office.&lt;ref name="Edersheim1856"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Edersheim|title=History of the Jewish nation after the destruction of Jerusalem under Titus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXQpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA551|accessdate=18 July 2011|year=1856|publisher=T. Constable and co.|page=551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers==
The Talmud tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] identifies two classes of rabbinical courts called Sanhedrin, a Great Sanhedrin (בית דין הגדול) and a Lesser Sanhedrin (בית דין הקטן). Each city could have its own lesser Sanhedrin of 23 judges, but there could be only one Great Sanhedrin of 71, which among other roles acted as the Supreme Court, taking appeals from cases decided by lesser courts. The uneven numbers of judges were predicated on eliminating the possibility of a tie and the last to cast their vote was the head of the court.

===Function and procedures===
The Sanhedrin as a body claimed powers that lesser Jewish courts did not have. As such, they were the only ones who could try the king, extend the boundaries of the Temple and Jerusalem, and were the ones to whom all questions of law were finally put. Before 191 BCE the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] acted as the ''ex officio'' head of the Sanhedrin,{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} but in 191 BCE, when the Sanhedrin lost confidence in the High Priest, the office of [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]] was created. After the time of [[Hillel the Elder]] (late 1st century BCE and early 1st century CE), the Nasi was almost invariably a descendant of Hillel. The second highest-ranking member of the Sanhedrin was called the [[Av Beit Din]], or "Head of the Court" (literally, Av Beit Din = "father of the house of judgment"), who presided over the Sanhedrin when it sat as a criminal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/economic/friedman/sanhedrin.htm |title=Sanhedrin |publisher=CUNY |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519083636/http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/economic/friedman/sanhedrin.htm |archivedate=2006-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Second Temple era, the Sanhedrin met in a building known as the [[Hall of Hewn Stones]] (''Lishkat ha-Gazit''), which has been placed by the Talmud and many scholars as built into the north wall of the [[Temple Mount]], half inside the sanctuary and half outside, with doors providing access both to the Temple and to the outside. The name presumably arises to distinguish it from the buildings in the Temple complex used for ritual purposes, which had to be constructed of stones unhewn by any [[iron]] implements.

In some cases, it was only necessary for a 23-member panel (functioning as a Lesser Sanhedrin) to convene. In general, the full panel of 71 judges was only convened on matters of national significance (e.g., a declaration of war) or in the event that the 23-member panel could not reach a conclusive verdict.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud: Sanhedrin [http://images.e-daf.com/DafImg.asp?ID=3613&amp;size=1 2a].&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, the Sanhedrin reached its pinnacle of importance, legislating all aspects of Jewish religious and political life within the parameters laid down by Biblical and Rabbinic tradition.

===Summary of Patriarchal powers===
The following is a summary of the powers and responsibilities of the Patriarchate from the onset of the third century, based on rabbinic sources as portrayed by L.I. Levine:&lt;ref name="LightstoneReligion2002p.189"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jack N. Lightstone|author2=Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion|title=Mishnah and the social formation of the early Rabbinic Guild: a socio-rhetorical approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s42kv4NGBU4C&amp;pg=PA189|accessdate=21 July 2011|date=13 May 2002|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=978-0-88920-375-4|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Representative to Imperial authorities;
#Focus of leadership in the Jewish community:
##Receiving daily visits from prominent families;
##Declaration of public fast days;
##Initiating or abrogating the ban (''[[herem (war or property)|herem]]'');
#Appointment of judges to Jewish courts in the Land of Israel;
#Regulation of the calendar;
#Issuing enactments and decrees with respect to the applicability or release from legal requirements, e.g.:
##Use of [[shmita|sabbatical year]] produce and applicability of sabbatical year injunctions;
##Repurchase or redemption of formerly Jewish land from gentile owners;
##Status of Hellenistic cities of the Land of Israel re: purity, tithing, sabbatical year;
##Exemptions from tithing;
##Conditions in divorce documents;
##Use of oil produced by gentiles;
#Dispatching emissaries to diaspora communities;
#Taxation: both the power to tax and the authority to rule/intervene on the disposition of taxes raised for local purposes by local councils.

Up to the middle of the fourth century, the Patriarchate retained the prerogative of determining the [[Hebrew calendar]] and guarded the intricacies of the calculation process in an effort to subdue interference from the Babylonian community. Due to Christian persecution, [[Hillel II]] was obliged to fix the calendar in permanent form  in 359 CE.&lt;ref name="inc2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZ0xAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 July 2011|year=2003|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|isbn=978-0-85229-961-6|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TausGarber2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Esther Rogoff Taus|author2=Zev Garber|title=Torah for Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASsHZFokICsC&amp;pg=PA97|accessdate=18 July 2011|date=28 April 2008|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-3635-3|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; This institution symbolized the passing of authority from the Patriarchate to the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Babylonian Academies]].&lt;ref name="Landman1941"&gt;{{cite book|author=Isaac Landman|title=The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia: an authoritative and popular presentation of Jews and Judaism since the earliest times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OrttAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=18 July 2011|year=1941|publisher=The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, inc.|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological findings===
In 2004, excavations in Tiberias conducted by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] uncovered a structure dating to the 3rd century CE that may have been the seat of the Sanhedrin when it convened in that city. At the time it was called Beit Hava'ad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/researchers-say-tiberias-basilica-may-have-housed-sanhedrin-1.117483|title=Researchers say Tiberias basilica may have housed Sanhedrin|date=22 March 2004|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 191 BCE the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] acted as the ''ex officio'' head of the Sanhedrin,{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} but in 191 BCE, when the Sanhedrin lost confidence in the High Priest, the office of [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]] was created. The Sanhedrin was headed by the chief scholars of the great [[Talmudic Academies in the Land of Israel]], and with the decline of the Sanhedrin, their spiritual and legal authority was generally accepted, the institution itself being supported by voluntary contributions by Jews throughout the ancient world. Being a member of the house of [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] and thus a descendant of [[King David]], the Patriarch, known in Hebrew as the ''[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]]'' (prince), enjoyed almost royal authority. Their functions were political rather than religious, though their influence was not limited to the secular realm.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911attribution"/&gt; The Patriarchate attained its zenith under [[Judah ha-Nasi]] who compiled the [[Mishnah]],&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm|chapter=Jews|title=Encyclopædia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MvctAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 July 2011|year=1911|publisher=The Encyclopædia Britannica company|page=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; a compendium of views from Judean thought leaders of Judaism other than the Torah.

==Revival attempts==
{{See also|Semicha#Attempts to revive classical semicha}}
The Sanhedrin is traditionally viewed as the last institution that commanded universal Jewish authority among the Jewish people in the long chain of tradition from [[Moses]] until the present day. Since its dissolution in 358 CE by imperial decree, there have been several attempts to re-establish this body either as a self-governing body, or as a puppet of a sovereign government.

There are records of what may have been of attempts to reform the Sanhedrin in Arabia,&lt;ref name="conquest"&gt;[http://www.alsadiqin.org/history/The%20Persian%20conquest%20of%20Jerusalem%20in%20614CE%20compared%20with%20Islamic%20conquest%20of%20638CE.pdf The Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614 compared with Islamic conquest of 638]&lt;/ref&gt; in Jerusalem under the Caliph 'Umar,&lt;ref name="conquest" /&gt; and in Babylon (Iraq),&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Yuchsin'', cf. ''Yarchei Kallah'', Rabbi Nassan describes "the seventy judges who comprise the Sanhedrin".&lt;/ref&gt; but none of these attempts were given any attention by Rabbinic authorities and little information is available about them.

===Napoleon Bonaparte's "Grand Sanhedrin"===
{{main|Napoleon Bonaparte's "Grand Sanhedrin"}}
[[File:Frenchsanhedrin2.jpg|thumb|Medallion struck in honor of the "Grand Sanhedrin" convened by [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Emperor Napoleon I of France]].]]

The "Grand Sanhedrin" was a Jewish high court convened by [[Napoleon I]] to give legal sanction to the principles expressed by the [[Assembly of Notables]] in answer to the twelve questions submitted to it by the government (see ''Jew. Encyc. v. 468, s.v. France'').

On October 6, 1806, the Assembly of Notables issued a proclamation to all the Jewish communities of Europe, inviting them to send delegates to the Sanhedrin, to convene on October 20. This proclamation, written in Hebrew, French, German, and Italian, speaks in extravagant terms of the importance of this revived institution and of the greatness of its imperial protector. While the action of Napoleon aroused in many Jews of Germany the hope that, influenced by it, their governments also would grant them the rights of citizenship, others looked upon it as a political contrivance. When in the war against Prussia (1806–07) the emperor invaded Poland and the Jews rendered great services to his army, he remarked, laughing, "The sanhedrin is at least useful to me."{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} David Friedländer and his friends in Berlin described it as a spectacle that Napoleon offered to the [[Paris]]ians.

===Modern attempts in Israel===
{{main|Modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin}}
Since the dissolution of the Sanhedrin in 358 CE,&lt;ref&gt;The dissolution of the Sanhedrin, in terms of its power to give binding universal decisions, is usually dated to 358 CE when [[Hillel II]]'s Jewish Calendar was adopted. This marked the last universally accepted decision made by that body.&lt;/ref&gt; there has been no universally recognized authority within [[Halakha]]. [[Maimonides]] (1135–1204) was one of the greatest scholars of the Middle Ages, and is arguably one of the most widely accepted scholars among the Jewish people since the closing of the Talmud in 500. Influenced by the rationalist school of thought and generally showing a preference for a natural (as opposed to miraculous) redemption for the Jewish people, [[Maimonides]] proposed a rationalist solution for achieving the goal of re-establishing the highest court in Jewish tradition and reinvesting it with the same authority it had in former years. There have been several attempts to implement [[Maimonides]]' recommendations, the latest being in modern times.

There have been rabbinical attempts to renew [[Semicha]] and re-establish a Sanhedrin by Rabbi [[Jacob Berab]] in 1538, Rabbi [[Yisroel Shklover]] in 1830, Rabbi Aharon Mendel haCohen in 1901, Rabbi Zvi Kovsker in 1940 and Rabbi [[Yehuda Leib Maimon]] in 1949.

In October 2004 (Tishrei 5765), a group of [[rabbi]]s representing varied Orthodox communities in [[Israel]] undertook a ceremony in [[Tiberias]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnn.com/data/asx2004/10/20/asx_1159_300.asx|title=Israel News - Israel's #1 News Site - Arutz Sheva|work=Arutz Sheva}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the original Sanhedrin was disbanded, in which it claimed to re-establish the body according to the proposal of [[Maimonides]] and the Jewish legal rulings of Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]]. The controversial attempt has been subject to debate within different Jewish communities.

{{Antisemitism}}
'''Strasserism''' ({{lang-de|Strasserismus}} or ''Straßerismus'') is a strand of [[Nazism]] that calls for a more radical, mass-action and worker-based form of Nazism—hostile to [[Jews]] not from a racial, ethnic, cultural or religious perspective, but from an [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] basis—to achieve a [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|national rebirth]]. It derives its name from [[Gregor Strasser|Gregor]] and [[Otto Strasser]], the two Nazi brothers initially associated with this position. 

Opposed on strategic views to [[Adolf Hitler]], Otto Strasser was expelled from the [[Nazi Party]] in 1930 and went into [[exile]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] while Gregor Strasser was murdered in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] on 30 June 1934 during the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. Strasserism remains an active position within strands of [[neo-Nazism]].

== Strasser brothers ==
=== Gregor Strasser ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1721, Gregor Strasser crop.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Gregor Strasser]] in 1928]]
[[Gregor Strasser]] (1892–1934) began his career in [[ultranationalism|ultranationalist]] politics by joining the ''[[Freikorps]]'' after serving in [[World War I]]. Strasser was involved in the [[Kapp Putsch]] and formed his own ''[[Völkisch movement|völkischer]] Wehrverband'' ("popular defense union") which he merged into the NSDAP in 1921. Initially a loyal supporter of [[Adolf Hitler]], he took part in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] and held a number of high positions in the [[Nazi Party]]. However, Strasser soon became a strong advocate of the [[Right-wing socialism|socialist]] wing of the party, arguing that the national revolution should also include strong action to tackle poverty and should seek to build [[working class]] support. After [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Hitler's rise to power]], [[Ernst Röhm]], who headed the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), then the most important paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, called for a second revolution aimed at removing the elites from control. This was opposed by the [[Conservatism in Germany|conservative movement]] as well as by some [[Nazism|Nazis]] who preferred an ordered authoritarian regime to the radical and disruptive program proposed by the party's left-wing.

=== Otto Strasser ===
[[File:Otto Strasser crop.jpg|thumb|left|203px|[[Otto Strasser]] giving a speech shortly after his return to Germany after World War II]]
[[Otto Strasser]] (1897–1974) had also been a member of the ''Freikorps'', but he joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] and fought against the Kapp Putsch. Strasser joined the Nazi Party in 1925, but he nonetheless retained his ideas about the importance of socialism. Considered more of a radical than his brother, Strasser was expelled by the Nazi Party in 1930 and set up his own dissident group, the [[Black Front]], which called for a specifically [[German nationalism|German nationalist]] form of socialist revolution. Strasser fled Germany in 1933 to live firstly in [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] and then [[Canada]] before returning to [[West Germany]] in later life, all the while writing prolifically about Hitler and what he saw as his betrayal of [[national socialist]] ideals.

== Ideology ==
The name Strasserism came to be applied to the form of Nazism that developed around the Strasser brothers. Although they had been involved in the creation of the [[National Socialist Program]] of 1920, both called on the party to commit to "breaking the shackles of finance capital".&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Husbands, 'Militant Neo-Nazism in the Federal Republic of Germany' in L. Cheles, R. Ferguson &amp; M. Vaughan, ''Neo-Fascism in Europe'', 1992, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Economic antisemitism|opposition to Jewish finance capitalism]], which they contrasted to "[[Producerism|productive capitalism]]”, was shared by [[Political views of Adolf Hitler|Hitler himself]], who borrowed it from [[Gottfried Feder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler: A Profile in Power'', first chapter (London, 1991, rev. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[Populism|populist]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] form of anti-capitalism was further developed in 1925 when Otto Strasser published the ''Nationalsozialistische Briefe'', which discussed notions of [[class conflict]], [[Redistribution of income and wealth|wealth redistribution]] and a possible alliance with the [[Soviet Union]]. His 1930 follow-up ''Ministersessel oder Revolution'' (''Cabinet Seat or Revolution'') went further by attacking Hitler's betrayal of the socialist aspect of Nazism as well as criticizing the notion of the ''[[Führerprinzip]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], ''The German Dictatorship'', 1973, pp. 230–231.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst Gregor Strasser echoed many of the calls of his brother, his influence on the ideology is less, owing to his remaining in the Nazi Party longer and to his early death. Meanwhile, Otto Strasser continued to expand his argument, calling for the break-up of large estates and the development of something akin to a [[Gremialismo|guild system]] and the related establishment of a ''Reich'' [[cooperative]] chamber to take a leading role in [[Planned economy|economic planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolte|first=Ernst|title=[[Three Faces of Fascism]]: Action Française, Italian fascism, National Socialism|year=1969|publisher=Mentor|location=New York|authorlink=Ernst Nolte|pages=425–426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strasserism therefore became a distinct strand of Nazism that whilst holding on to previous Nazi ideals such as [[palingenetic ultranationalism]] and antisemitism, added a strong [[Criticism of capitalism|critique of capitalism]] and framed this in the demand for a more socialist-based approach to economics.

However, it is disputed whether Strasserism was a distinct form of Nazism. According to historian [[Ian Kershaw]], "the leaders of the SA [which included Gregor Strasser] did not have another vision of the future of Germany or another politic to propose". The Strasserites advocated the radicalization of the [[Nazi regime]] and the toppling of the [[Junker (Prussia)|German elites]], calling Hitler's rise to power a half-revolution which needed to be completed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw]], 1991, chapter III, first section.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
=== In Germany ===
During the 1970s, the ideas of Strasserism began to be referred to more in European far-right groups as younger members with no ties to Hitler and a stronger sense of anti-capitalism came to the fore. Strasserite thought in Germany began to emerge as a tendency within the [[National Democratic Party of Germany|National Democratic Party]] (NPD) during the late 1960s. These Strasserites played a leading role in securing the removal of [[Adolf von Thadden]] from the leadership and after his departure the party became stronger in condemning Hitler for what it saw as his move away from socialism in order to court business and army leaders.&lt;ref&gt;R. Eatwell, ''Fascism: A History'', 2003, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although initially adopted by the NPD, Strasserism soon became associated with more peripheral extremist figures, notably [[Michael Kühnen]] who produced a 1982 pamphlet ''Farewell to Hitler'', which included a strong endorsement of the idea. The [[Volkssozialistische Bewegung Deutschlands/Partei der Arbeit|People's Socialist Movement of Germany/Labour Party]] (a minor extremist movement that was outlawed in 1982) adopted the policy while its successor movement, the [[Nationalist Front (Germany)|Nationalist Front]], did likewise, with its ten-point programme calling for an "anti-materialist cultural revolution" and an "anti-capitalist social revolution" to underline its support for the idea.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Husbands, "Militant Neo-Nazism in the Federal Republic of Germany" in L. Cheles, R. Ferguson, M. Vaughan, ''Neo-Fascism in Europe'', 1992, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Free German Workers' Party]] also moved towards these ideas under the leadership of [[Friedhelm Busse]] in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Husbands, "Militant Neo-Nazism in the Federal Republic of Germany" in L. Cheles, R. Ferguson, M. Vaughan, ''Neo-Fascism in Europe'', 1992, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The flag of the Strasserite movement [[Black Front]] and its symbol a crossed hammer and a sword has been used by German and other European [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] abroad as a substitute for the more infamous [[Nazi flag]] which is banned in some countries such as Germany.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

=== In the United Kingdom ===
Strasserism emerged in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s and centred on the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] (NF) publication ''Britain First'', the main writers of which were [[David McCalden]], [[Richard Lawson (UK politician)|Richard Lawson]] and [[Denis Pirie]]. Opposing the leadership of [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]], they formed an alliance with [[John Kingsley Read]] and ultimately followed him into the [[National Party (UK, 1976)|National Party]] (NP).&lt;ref&gt;N. Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy'', 2004, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The NP called for British workers to seize the right to work and offered a fairly Strasserite economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;M. Walker, ''The National Front'', 1977, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the NP failed to last for very long. Due in part to Read's lack of enthusiasm for Strasserism, the main exponents of the idea drifted away.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The idea was reintroduced to the NF by [[Andrew Brons]] in the early 1980s when he decided to make the party's ideology clearer.&lt;ref&gt;N. Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy'', 2004, pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Strasserism was soon to become the province of the radicals in the [[Official National Front]], with Richard Lawson brought in a behind-the-scenes role to help direct policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerry Gable|G. Gable]], 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain' in L. Cheles, R. Ferguson &amp; M. Vaughan, ''Neo-Fascism in Europe'', 1992, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Political Soldier]] wing ultimately opted for the indigenous alternative of [[distributism]], but their strong anti-capitalist rhetoric as well as that of their [[International Third Position]] successor demonstrated influences from Strasserism. From this background, [[Troy Southgate]] emerged, whose own ideology and those of related groups such as the [[English Nationalist Movement]] and [[National Revolutionary Faction]] were influenced by Strasserism. He has also described himself as a post-Strasserite.

=== Elsewhere ===
[[Third Position]] groups, whose inspiration is generally more Italian in derivation, have often looked to Strasserism, owing to their strong opposition to capitalism. This was noted in France, where the student group ''[[Groupe Union Droit|Groupe Union Défense]]'' and the more recent ''[[Renouveau français]]'' both extolled Strasserite economic platforms.&lt;ref&gt;R. Griffin, ''The Nature of Fascism'', 1993, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to reinterpret Nazism as having a left-wing base have also been heavily influenced by this school of thought, notably through the work of [[Povl Riis-Knudsen]], who produced the Strasser-influenced work ''National Socialism: A Left-Wing Movement'' in 1984.

In the United States, [[Tom Metzger]] also flirted with Strasserism, having been influenced by Kühnen's pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin A. Lee|M.A. Lee]], ''[[The Beast Reawakens]]'', 1997, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;
