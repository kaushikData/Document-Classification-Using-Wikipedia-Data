Support for an exhibition had been sought in 1886,&lt;ref name="bologna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/732428.html|title=Buffalo Bill's Wild West in Europe|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with a loss of support and the British government insisting that an American exhibition not compete with the [[Colonial and Indian Exhibition]], the American Exhibition was deferred to 1887.&lt;ref name="bologna" /&gt;

The American aim of participating was to display the latest agricultural, mechanical and textile products and inventions from the [[United States]],&lt;ref name="considered"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|issue=9|first=Ted|last=Hovet|url=http://www.19.bbk.ac.uk/article/download/ntn.508/430|accessdate=5 April 2012|title=America on Display: Constructing and Containing Images of the United States | journal= 19: Interdisciplinary Studies in the Long Nineteenth Century}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the main attraction was the ''Wild West'' show&lt;ref name="bologna" /&gt; featuring [[William Cody|Buffalo Bill]],&lt;ref name="considered" /&gt; part of [[Colorado]]'s contribution.&lt;ref name="considered" /&gt;

Other exhibitions included a showing of [[Albert Bierstadt]]'s painting of the [[Bahama Islands]]: ''A Nor'wester in the Bahama Island.'' &lt;ref name="powle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jabezcorner.com/Grand_Bahama/powle.htm|title=Powle , L. D. The Land of the Pink Pearl|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Wild West'' Show==

The 1887 American Exhibition was the first time that [[William Cody]]'s ''Wild West'' show came to London.&lt;ref name="codyarch"&gt;{{cite web|title=William F. Cody Archive|url=http://codyarchive.org/life/wfc.bio.00002.html|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show itself was based on a spectacle, "The Drama of Civilization," created by [[Steele MacKaye]], [[Matt Morgan (cartoonist)|Matt Morgan]], and Nelse Waldron for the earlier American version of the ''Wild West'' show.&lt;ref name="moses"&gt;{{cite book|title=L. G. Moses, ''Wild West Shows and the Images of American Indians, 1883-1933.''|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spectacle was a series of ''[[tableau vivant]]s'' grouped into 4 "epochs": "The Primeval Forest," "The Prairie," "Cattle Ranch," and "Mining Camp." Act I, "The Primeval Forest," ended with a fight among the Indians, and it was followed by an interlude featuring dancing by indigenous people and a demonstration of [[Lillian Smith (trick shooter)|Lillian Smith]]'s sharp-shooting.&lt;ref name="Moses, p. 34"&gt;Moses, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Act II, "The Prairie," "included a buffalo hunt by the Indians," the passage of a train through "hostile land," a prairie fire, and a stampede, followed by cowboy "riding, roping, and 'bronc busting.'"&lt;ref name="Moses, p. 34"/&gt; "The Attack on the Mining Camp," Act or Epoch III, starred Cody defending a cabin against "gunfire and screaming Indians," followed by Cody's and [[Annie Oakley]]'s shooting. The last epoch, "Mining Camp," featured the Pony Express, an attack on a Deadwood stagecoach, and a cyclone. Ultimately, a 5th epoch was added, "Custer's Last Stand," at the end of which Cody entered and circled the arena on a horse, while "Too Late!" was projected onto the [[cyclorama]]. (Although the conclusion to "The Drama of Civilization" might suggest that Cody took part in the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], he was not near enough to have arrived at the site of the battle immediately after it was over; furthermore, it is not likely that his presence would have altered the outcome of the battle.)&lt;ref name="Moses, p. 34"/&gt;

Transporting Buffalo Bill's ''Wild West'' from New York to the UK represented an enormous undertaking, bringing to London a large number of people and animals. Performers included Oakley, 97 indigenous people, mostly people from the [[Sioux]] tribes, including [[Black Elk]] and Chief [[Red Shirt (Oglala)|Red Shirt]], as well as African-American and Mexican or Mexican-American people. The ''Wild West'' brought into the UK a large number of animals — "180 horses, 18 buffalo, 10 elk, 5 Texan steers, 4 donkeys, and 2 deer" as well as 10 mules&lt;ref&gt;Moses, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; — with customs officials suspending normal quarantine requirements in spite of a local outbreak of [[Foot-and-mouth disease|hoof-and-mouth disease]].&lt;ref name="bologna" /&gt; Also on board the ship bringing the performers and animals was a real Deadwood stagecoach.

Cody invited the Prince of Wales, later [[King Edward VII]], to a private preview of the ''Wild West'' performance on May 5, and the Prince of Wales was impressed enough to arrange a command performance for [[Queen Victoria]] on May 11, 1887. The Queen enjoyed the show and recorded in her journal meeting Cody, Annie Oakley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shirl Kasper, Annie Oakley|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lillian Smith, Chief Red Shirt, and a number of indigenous American women and children. Black Elk recalled Queen Victoria speaking respectfully to the indigenous performers and their families later in his ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]'', but Victoria describes them in their roles in "The Drama of Civilization" as "rather alarming looking, [with] cruel faces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/ |title=Queen Victoria's Journals |work=Princess Beatrice's copies  |date=11 May 1887 | publisher=RA VIC/MAIN/QVJ (W) |accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the dancers and a young teenager at the time, Black Elk says of Victoria that she "was little but fat and we liked her, because she was good to us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=''Black Elk Speaks: Being the Life Story of a Holy Man of the Ogalala Sioux, As Told To John G. Neihardt'' |page=225 |publisher=MJF Books |year=1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Queen Victoria the War Dance they danced, "to a wild drum &amp; pipe, was quite fearful, with all their contortions &amp; shrieks, &amp; they came so close."

The success of this command performance for the Queen — her first appearance at a public performance since [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Consort Albert]] died in 1861&lt;ref&gt;Moses, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; — set the stage for another command performance on June 20, 1887, for her [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Golden Jubilee]] guests. While Victoria herself did not attend this performance, royalty from all over Europe attended, including the future [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] and future [[King George V]].&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;{{cite book|title=Russell, The Lives and Legends of Buffalo Bill|pages=330–331}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Victoria made one more visit to the Exhibition, on June 22, 1887,&lt;ref&gt;Moses, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; although, surprisingly, she does not refer to it in her journal for that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/ |title=Queen Victoria's Journals |work=Princess Beatrice's copies  |date=22 June 1887 | publisher=RA VIC/MAIN/QVJ (W) |accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These royal encounters provided Buffalo Bill's ''Wild West'' an endorsement and publicity that ensured its success.

Buffalo Bill's ''Wild West'' closed its London run in October 1887 after over 300 performances and more than two and a half million tickets sold.&lt;ref&gt;Gallop, Buffalo Bill's British Wild West, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Avatar: The Last Airbender – The Promise''''' is a [[graphic novel]] in three parts written by [[Gene Yang]] and illustrated by Studio [[Gurihiru]], the first in a [[Avatar: The Last Airbender (comics)#Graphic novel trilogies|series of graphic novel trilogies]] serving as both a continuation of the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' and a prequel to ''[[The Legend of Korra]]'', both animated television series created by [[Michael Dante DiMartino]] and [[Bryan Konietzko]]. ''Part 1'' was released on January 25, 2012, ''Part 2'' was released on May 30, 2012 and ''Part 3'' was released on September 26, 2012.

The events of ''The Promise'' begin immediately after the last episode of the original series, "[[Sozin's Comet: The Final Battle|Avatar Aang]]", before jumping forward a year. It is followed by ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender – The Search]]''.

==Overview==
Although the one-hundred-year War is finally over, tensions run high as thirteen-year-old Avatar [[Aang]] and seventeen-year-old [[Zuko]] are put on a "collision course" after the Avatar travels to a Fire Nation colony named "Yu Dao", and finds "tension between neighbors" – a threat that may "shatter the world's newfound peace".

The unfinished conversation between Zuko and Ozai about the whereabouts of Ursa, Zuko's long-lost mother, is completed, but the conversation takes a different path after Zuko asks the question and her fate still remains unknown. Zuko forces Aang to promise to kill him if he becomes like his father, the deposed [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters#Major recurring characters|Fire Lord Ozai]].

Negotiations with Earth King Kuei and the beginning of the Harmony Restoration Movement commence. The movement plans to take the people in the Fire Nation colonies and move them into the Fire Nation itself. However, an unexpected controversy breaks out, as the older colonies are composed of people who have never lived within the Fire Nation and have intermarried with Earth Kingdom citizens. These people view the movement as robbing them of their homes. Fire Lord Zuko is caught between the desires of his people and the demands of many who believe peace and balance is only attainable if Fire Nation citizens return to their country. When the Earth Kingdom army arrives to enforce the Restoration Movement, Zuko deploys his own forces in defense of the colonies, leading to an explosive showdown between the recently belligerent sides and threatening to reignite the fires of war. Aang must decide whether to follow through on his promise, and decide the fate of the colonies in the process.

In the midst of this dispute, Toph's new metal bending school finds itself in trouble, while Aang is confronted with the "Avatar Fan Movement," a growing group of young individuals trying to live as the air nomads did, but Aang views these people as parodying and denigrating the memory of his people.

==Plot==

===Part One===
Following Fire Lord Ozai's defeat and the conclusion of the Hundred Year War, the Harmony Restoration Movement is established to remove the Fire Nation Colonies in the Earth Kingdom and relocate the colonists to the Fire Nation. Having become the new Fire Lord, Zuko makes Aang promise to kill him, should he turn out like his father.

One year later, Zuko survives an attempt on his life made by Kori Morishita, in protest against the Harmony Restoration Movement. Learning that Kori is the daughter of the Mayor of Yu Dao, the first colony created by the Fire Nation, Zuko travels to the city to confront the Morishita family. He learns that over the last century, the Fire Nation colonists have become deeply integrated with the original Earth Kingdom citizens, to the point that there are now mixed-race families, industries that use expertise from both cultures, and Earthbenders who consider themselves Fire Nation citizens, including Kori. Realizing that the Harmony Restoration Movement would bring an end to this, Zuko withdraws his support for it.

Zuko's decision causes protests from Earth Kingdom citizens, including the Freedom Fighters, who believe that Zuko is refusing to give up the colonies, and prompts Aang, Katara and Sokka to travel to Yu Dao to confront him. Aang's predecessor Avatar Roku urges Aang to fulfill his promise to Zuko, reminding him that his own failure to kill Fire Lord Sozin led to the Hundred Year War happening in the first place. Arriving in Yu Dao, Aang and Katara get into a fight with Zuko and his troops, and Aang nearly goes into the Avatar State, but he is talked out of it by Katara.
 
Despite seeing the prosperity of Yu Dao for himself, Aang insists that the Fire Nation cannot keep occupying part of the Earth Kingdom if the world is to live in harmony. Katara suggests that Yu Dao be the exception to this rule, but Zuko states that the same should be done for the remaining colonies. Although doubtful, Aang agrees to try to get Earth King Kuei to talk with Zuko on what to do. The Earth Kingdom protestors are unhappy with Aang's decision, having suffered the presence of the colonies for over a century, and give him three days before they attempt to retake the city for themselves. Returning to the Fire Nation, Zuko visits his father for advice.

===Part Two===
Aang and Katara travel to the city of Ba Sing Se to meet with Kuei. Upon arriving in the metropolis, Aang learns that an Avatar Aang fan club has been set up to honor him. Aang briefly enjoys the company of his fans, since they remind him of his old life among the Air Nomads. The two teenagers then try to convince Kuei to meet with Zuko, but the Earth King, in an attempt to appear strong after Long Feng's manipulation of him, states that he will order troops to Yu Dao to ensure the completion of the Harmony Restoration movement. Aang and Katara return to Yu Dao to try and convince the colonists to evacuate before the Earth Kingdom army arrives.

In the Fire Nation, Ozai talks about Zuko's indecisiveness, referring to an event from Zuko's childhood in which it nearly got him killed. Zuko interprets the story as his father saying that he should side with the stronger side in the conflict, but Ozai tells him that, as Fire Lord, whatever decision he makes is the right one, by virtue of the fact that he made it. Correctly predicting Kuei's response to the Yu Dao crisis, Ozai urges his son to do whatever is necessary to protect his citizens, viewing them as an expression of the Fire Lord's will. Zuko subsequently becomes reluctant to do so, out of fear that he would be no different from his father.

In a subplot, Sokka learns that Toph's Metalbending Academy, which she set up in Yu Dao following the end of the Hundred Year War, has been taken over by a rival Firebending Dojo as a result of Zuko's opposition to the Harmony Restoration Movement. Sokka and the Firebending master agree to a match between Toph's students and his disciples in three days, Sokka is unaware that Toph's students don't know how to bend metal. After several unsuccessful attempts to get the students metalbending, Toph gives up, explaining to Sokka that while she recruited her students with the belief that they could become metalbenders, she feels that she's been trying to force them to become something they're not, similar to how her parents treated her. Toph's students overhear the conversation, and upon realizing that Toph believed that they could become more than what they were, they are inspired to figure out how to metalbend, and subsequently win the match.

Zuko's girlfriend Mai learns about his meetings with Ozai from Suki, who is serving as one of Zuko's bodyguards. Upset that Zuko would keep secrets from her, Mai breaks up with him. Shortly afterwards, Zuko learns that Kuei's army is marching towards Yu Dao. Sadly admitting that his father was right, Zuko mobilises his own forces to defend the colonists.

===Part Three===
Returning to Yu Dao, Aang and Katara learn that the people of the city have formed the Yu Dao Resistance, in response to the Earth Kingdom protesters, with Sneers as one of the members. Aang also encounters the Yu Dao chapter of the Avatar Aang Fan Club, who had been informed of the approaching conflict by the Ba Sing Se chapter, but becomes offended when he sees the members wearing airbending master tattoos, considering this an insult against his culture. He subsequently decides to see the Harmony Restoration Movement through to the end, believing that harmony can only be achieved when all four nations are separate, as stronger nations cannot help but hurt or make fun of weaker ones. Leaving the scene with Aang, Katara, who no longer supports the Harmony Restoration Movement, starts to explain how she saw more than just Kori and her family when she saw Yu Dao, but is interrupted by an attempt by the protesters to force entry into the city.

As Aang and Katara unsuccessfully attempt to stop the protesters, Sokka, Toph and Suki, who had warned the other two about Zuko's intentions, attempt to delay the Fire Nation forces, fearing that another war will start when the two armies meet, Despite their best efforts, Zuko's army meets up with the Earth Kingdom army led by General How. Arriving on the scene, Aang goes into the Avatar State, while berating Zuko for giving up on the Harmony Restoration Movement. Katara again manages to talk him down, and explains that when she saw the Morishitas, a family with the heritage of two different nations, she saw her and Aang's future, and asks what separating the nations will mean for the two of them. At her advice, Aang leaves the scene in order to decide on a course of action, whilst his friends and the Avatar Aang Fan Club attempt to stop the fighting. As Aang meditates, Roku again tells Aang to think of the world above all else and fulfill his promise, revealing that he is Zuko's great-grandfather on his mother's side. Aang is horrified that Roku would consider killing his great-grandson for the sake of harmony.

During the battle, Katara forces her way onto the blimp that Kuei is watching the battle from, and realizes that the Earth King is unaware of the true nature of Yu Dao, having never been there himself. She convinces him to come down to the city and see the people who will have to live with his decisions. As Zuko and General Hao prepare to do battle, Aang arrives in the Avatar State. Believing that the Avatar has come to kill him, Zuko protests, before sadly admitting that he is doing exactly what his father would have done. Aang instead uses his Earthbending to create a huge chasm around Yu Dao, cutting the two armies off from the city, and rescues Zuko when the latter nearly falls into it. He introduces Kuei to the Yu Dao resistance and explains that the Earth King is not just fighting a colony, but a new kind of world. Kuei begins to understand the situation, while Zuko, faced with the revelation that he has been in the right all along, collapses.

Four days afterwards, Aang severs his connection with Roku, stating that the world is very different from when the last Avatar lived, and that he cannot think of the world without thinking of his friends, including Zuko. Aang, Kuei and Zuko agree to meet and discuss the fate of Yu Dao, Zuko and Aang both believing that it must become something other than a Fire Nation colony or an Earth Kingdom city. Zuko also apologizes for having Aang make his promise in the first place, viewing it as a way to save him from having to choose between right and wrong. Aang decides to teach the Avatar Aang Fan Club the ways of the Air Nomads in order to preserve their culture, dubbing them the Air Acolytes. The book - and by extension, the trilogy - end with Zuko talking with his sister Azula, now incarcerated in a mental institution, about searching for their mother.

==Publication==
Since the conclusion of the original series in July 2008, fans of ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' have demanded a more satisfying denouement in relation to the fates of the main characters. In late 2010, Samantha Robertson, an editor at [Dark Horse Comics] at the time, approached comic author [[Gene Yang]], who was best known for his ''[[American Born Chinese]]'' series. After "some conversations" with her and the creators of ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'', [[Michael Dante DiMartino]] and [[Bryan Konietzko]], Yang was contracted to write three graphic novels to serve as a direct continuation of the original series. Yang's approach to the writing of ''The Promise'' is purported to be "purist", and he has collaborated closely with DiMartino and Konietzko. The first volume of this new series of comics was released on January 25, 2012.

==Reception==
''The Promise Part 1'' has received mostly positive reviews, with Convention Scene praising Yang's portrayal of the characters. Convention Scene also praised Gurihiru Studio's artwork, stating that it did justice to the series. The ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'' called the graphic novel an "enjoyable read even if you are not well versed in the story's universe."

'''''Back to the Future Part III''''' (or '''''Back to the Future III''''') is the title of a [[video game]] based on the [[Back to the Future Part III|film of the same name]]. The game is different from LJN's ''[[Back to the Future Part II &amp; III]]'' video game released for the [[NES]]. The game was released in 1991 for the [[Sega Genesis]], [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Sega Master System]], and the [[ZX Spectrum]]. Each version of the game is more or less identical and all are loosely based on the popular film of the same name. The game was developed by Probe Software and published by [[Image Works]] and Arena Entertainment (for Sega).

==Gameplay==
The main game features four different levels (there are some differences between versions).

;Rescue Clara
:Players control [[Emmett Brown|Doc Brown]] on a horse as he races to save [[Clara Clayton]] from running off into a ravine. Players must duck and jump over obstacles while using a pistol to shoot enemies and other obstacles. In the DOS version, there are also top down segments where Doc can collect a shotgun to fire in multiple directions.
;Target Shoot
:Players control [[Marty McFly|Marty]] as he shoots targets in a target range. A bonus round can be obtained by shooting multi-colored ducks.
;Marty vs. Buford's Men
:Players control Marty as he uses pie dishes to fight off against [[Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen|Buford]]'s men, and eventually Buford himself.
;The Train
:Players control Marty as he makes away across the train, collecting speed logs necessary to get the train up to {{convert|88|mi/h}} while fending off enemies and avoiding obstacles such as hooks or puffs of smoke.

[[File:Harlow-publicity.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Harlow]] played a bad girl in ''[[Red-Headed Woman]]'' (1932)]]

"'''Bad girl movies'''" are a subcategory, mostly, although not exclusively, of [[films noir]], labeled by latter-day [[film|movie]] buffs to describe dark films, mostly in the 1940s and 1950s, but some earlier, and others later, starring provocative, scheming, often sexy or beautiful, but compelling even when not, women, almost always on the wrong side of the spirit and usually the letter of the law. Some are quite young, others not. Manipulative, larcenous, murderous, vengeful, troubled, hedonistic, depraved, or any combination therein, they were occasionally misunderstood, softened or redeemed, but sometimes only at death's door. Some very early and much later exemplars got away with their crimes, but most paid, one way or another, as the censors required. These film's posters usually featured [[physical attractiveness|sexy]] artwork of the actress, posed seductively. Currently, these images in original posters and reproductions are as valued as are the films themselves.

'''''Balls of Steel''''' is a [[pinball]] [[Video game|computer game]] developed by [[Wildfire Studios]] and released on December 12, 1997. It is the only game to be published under the Pinball Wizards label, a division of Apogee Software (today known as [[3D Realms]]).

When the game was originally released, it was possible to upload high scores to the WorldScores server, for a global ranking. This feature has since been discontinued.

==Tables==
''Balls of Steel'' features five original pinball tables:
*''Darkside'': Set on a remote [[space station]] under attack by [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] creatures.
*''Barbarian'': A classic medieval [[fantasy]] quest with a huge [[dragon]] on the table.
*''Firestorm'': Set in a crime-ridden [[United States|US]] city, a mad bomber is on the loose.
*''Mutation'': Set in an underground science lab where a [[Biological hazard|bio-hazardous]] accident has occurred and a large, slimy monster has taken over the lab.
*''Duke Nukem'': A special table featuring the Apogee video game character [[Duke Nukem (series)|Duke Nukem]]. Another table, ''Devil's Island'', was dropped from the game when Wildfire was given the opportunity by Apogee to include a Duke Nukem table. ''Devil's Island'' was later released as a standalone game.[http://legacy.3drealms.com/balls/tableinfo.html#devilsisland]

==Duke Nukem tie-in==
The game includes a table based on the Apogee/3D Realms video game ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' including graphics from that game and original voice-overs by Nukem actor [[Jon St. John]]. Pinball missions include fighting monsters like octabrains and pig-cops, and using powerups such as [[jetpack]]s and the Holoduke, from the Duke Nukem 3D video game.

Graphics of a pinball game named ''Balls of Steel'' appear in ''Duke Nukem 3D'' itself, in the first level, "Hollywood Holocaust", when Duke encounters the table. ''Balls of Steel'' reappears in ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]''.

==Reception==
''Balls of Steel'' was a finalist for ''[[Computer Games Magazine|Computer Games Strategy Plus]]''{{'}}s 1998 "Classic Game of the Year" award, which ultimately went to ''[[Centipede (1998 video game)|Centipede]]''. The editors wrote that ''Balls of Steel'' "demonstrated that you can do the Bally table on the PC, and do it well."&lt;ref name=cgmawards1998&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050203235412/http://cdmag.com/articles/017/163/best_of_year.html |url=http://cdmag.com:80/articles/017/163/best_of_year.html |title=The Best of 1998 |date=February 11, 1999 |work=[[Computer Games Magazine|Computer Games Strategy Plus]] |archivedate=2005-02-03 |deadurl=yes |df= |access-date=2018-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth Gertrude Bunter''', better known as '''Bessie Bunter''', is a fictional character created by [[Charles Hamilton (writer)|Charles Hamilton]], who also created her more famous brother [[Billy Bunter]].

==History==
[[Image:Bessie Bunter of Cliff House.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|left|Bessie Bunter of Cliff House]]

Billy Bunter was a central character in the [[Greyfriars School]] stories which appeared in the boys' story paper, ''[[The Magnet]]'' from 1907 to 1940 and Bessie's first appearance was in a  1919 Greyfriars story. She was a pupil of Cliff House School, a girls' school near Greyfriars. 

In 1919, attempting to replicate the success of ''The Magnet'', Amalgamated Press decided to bring out a new magazine for girls called ''The School Friend'' (later ''[[The Schoolgirl]]''), which included stories by Hamilton about Cliff House using the pen-name Hilda Richards, supposedly the sister of Frank. The stories were soon taken over by other authors, also using the name Hilda Richards. The most prolific of these substitute writers was John W. Wheway, who wrote well over 500 Cliff House stories between 1931 and 1940.{{ Harvcol |Lofts|Adley|1975|pp=65}}

Hamilton wrote one more Cliff House story, in 1949, called "Bessie Bunter of Cliff House School", and published by Cassell. 

The character also appeared in comic-strip format; in addition, she featured as an adult character in ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'' where she married the former Greyfriars schoolboy [[Harry Wharton]].

==Character==

Bessie Bunter was essentially a female counterpart to her brother Billy, sharing many characteristics with her brother, including her large size and large appetite. She was as unappealing as her brother Billy, being conceited, untruthful, gluttonous and obese, but she was rather more domineering than he was and would usually impose her will by nagging, or, in the case of her brothers, by administering hefty slaps to the head {{Harvcol|Cadogan|1988|p=20}}.

'''''Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Game Boy Adventure: A Bogus Journey!''''' is an [[action game|action]]-[[puzzle game]] based on the [[Bill &amp; Ted (franchise)|Bill &amp; Ted films]]  released by [[Acclaim Entertainment]] for the [[Game Boy]] in {{vgy|1991}}.

== Plot and gameplay ==
[[Image:BTGBADS1.png|thumb|left|150px|Level one.]]

DeNomolos has hatched another plan to alter history in his favor. He has stolen special orbs called Time Fragments and scattered them all across time. Now Bill and Ted must travel across time to retrieve the time fragments to prevent the future from altering. But it won't be easy for the [[San Dimas, California|San Dimas]] duo. As DeNomolos has the aid of the evil robot Bill and Ted, plus he has brainwashed [[Grim Reaper|Death]] and some historical figures to stop them along the way.

Each level takes place on a single screen. Players must collect scattered time fragments while jumping platforms, climbing ladders or ropes, and avoiding enemies. Because this is a Game Boy game, all sprites are very simplistic as both Bill and Ted have almost identical game sprites. In addition, enemies are only differentiated by their actions.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''bit Generations''}}
'''''bit Generations''''' is a [[video game]] franchise for the [[Game Boy Advance]], published by [[Nintendo]]. It was first announced under the name '''''Digitylish''''' at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) in 2005.&lt;ref name="digilux"&gt;{{cite web | author=Harris, Craig | date=March 13, 2006 | title=IGN: Digitylish Series Returns | url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/695/695560p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the games in the series feature simple controls, gameplay and graphics. All the games were developed by [[Skip Ltd.]], except for ''Digidrive'', which was developed by [[Q-Games]].

The ''bit Generations'' series has only been released in Japan. The games were released in two "series" - the games in Series One were released in Japan on July 13, 2006. Series Two was released on July 27, 2006. However, from June 1, 2006, Nintendo had sent out 700 copies of the games to random [[Club Nintendo]] members, encouraging them to preview the games and to post their opinions at the ''bit Generations'' official website.

In March 2006, some of the games were given an [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] rating and were labelled under the title '''''Digilux Series'''''.&lt;ref name="digilux"/&gt; However, Nintendo of America did not announce a release of the series in North America. Stickers depicting the game logos in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' indicated that the game series was intended to be released under the title ''Digilux'' outside Japan. Some of the games were eventually released under the ''[[Art Style]]'' banner for the [[WiiWare]] and [[DSiWare]] services.&lt;ref name=ignartstyle&gt;{{cite web | author=Harris, Craig | date=October 1, 2008 | title=IGN: Art Style's Bit Generation | url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/915/915341p1.html | publisher=IGN| accessdate=2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games==
[[Image:Bit Generation Games.JPG|200px|right|thumb|''bit Generations'' game carts]]

===Boundish===
'''''Boundish''''' is played similar to the ''[[Magnavox Odyssey]]'' game ''Tennis'' and the arcade game ''[[Pong]]'', with players hitting an orb back and forth between two paddles. However, each level of the game contains different objectives that require the player to alter the way the orb is battered about.&lt;ref name=ignartstyle/&gt;

===Dialhex===
{{main article|Rotohex}}

===Dotstream===
'''''Dotstream''''' is played by players guiding their dot, which results in a line trailing behind it, through a track filled with obstacles such as squares, rectangles, and circles. Races (known as "drawings") are typically 2 laps long.

''Dotstream'' features three modes, Grand Prix, Spot Race and Formation. Grand Prix is considered the "main game", with players racing around five circuits, with new drawings unlocked in this mode. Spot Race is a [[time attack]] mode around unlocked drawings. Formation begins with the player starting with one dot and having to collect small pellets to fill up a meter. When the meter is sufficiently filled up, another dot will appear to assist in the collection of pellets. While only the player's dot can be directly controlled, additional dots can be manipulated by holding down the appropriate Formation button.

A [[WiiWare]] version was released in North America on May 24, 2010 and in the PAL region on June 25, 2010, under the name '''''light trax'''''.

===Coloris===
'''''Coloris''''' sees players eliminating colored squares by altering the color of other squares to make them the same color as the squares nearby.

The game features two different game modes: clear mode and score mode. In clear mode the player must eliminate a certain number of squares (depending on the difficulty level) before moving on to the next level. In score mode the player must eliminate squares to achieve a high score.

===Orbital===
{{main article|Orbient}}

===Soundvoyager===
'''''Soundvoyager''''' is intended to be played using sound only, without looking at the console's screen. The game involves several different subgames, one of which has players trying to center a dot on a side scrolling stage on top of an invisible target by only using sounds from the left and right speakers to guide them and another involves the player [[driving the wrong way]] down a three lane road trying to dodge oncoming vehicles by listening to which lane they are in.&lt;ref name=ignartstyle/&gt;

===Digidrive===
'''''Digidrive''''' is the seventh and final installment of the ''bit Generations'' series. Developed by [[Q-Games]], it is the only game in the series not developed by skip Ltd.

The object of the game is to propel the disc-shaped core as many meters as possible before the piston collides into the core and ends the game. The player must direct up to three different varieties of "vehicle," each of a different color, into one of four different lanes. If five of the same vehicle fill up the same lane, a triangle will appear and the lane will change to the same color as the type of vehicle that entered this lane.

A DSiWare version was released in the PAL regions under the name '''''[[Intersect (video game)|Intersect]]''''' on October 2, 2009, and under the original '''''Digidrive''''' title in Japan on November 4, 2009 and in North America on November 16, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.nintendo.com/articles.jsp?id=20784 |title=Try Before You Buy: Nintendo Offers 5 Game Demos to Guide Holiday Shoppers |publisher=Nintendo of America |date=16 November 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/newsArt.cfm?artid=20326 |archivedate=16 November 2009 |accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Image:Bit Generation Box.JPG|200px|right|thumb|''bit Generations'' game boxes]]  
''[[Famitsu]]'' magazine scored games in the ''bit Generations'' series varying scores from average to positive. Based on a panel of four reviewers and a maximum score of 40, ''Dotstream'' received a 30, ''Orbital'' received a 29, ''Soundvoyager'' and ''Digidrive'' each received a 28, ''Dialhex'' received a 27, ''Boundish'' received a 26, and ''Coloris'' received a 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Riley, Adam | date=July 19, 2006 |title= Nintendo's Latest from Japan Scored | url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/5551/ | publisher=Cubed3 | accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=RawMeatCowboy | date=July 6, 2006 | title=Famitsu scores | url=http://gonintendo.com/viewstory.php?id=3517 | publisher=GoNintendo | accessdate=2009-08-08 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl August Nicholas Rosa''' (22 March 1842{{spaced ndash}}30 April 1889) was a German-born musical [[impresario]] best remembered for founding an English opera company known as the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]].  He started his company in 1869 together with his wife, [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa]], and popularised opera in Britain and America, performing standard repertory in English, as well as operas by English composers.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Parepa-Rosa, Euphrosyne, 1836-1874.jpg|upright|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa]]&lt;center&gt;]]
Rosa was born '''Karl August Nikolaus Rose''' in [[Hamburg]], Germany, the son of Ludwig Rose, a Hamburg businessman, and Sophie Becker.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  His father subsequently took him to Edinburgh. A child prodigy, Rosa toured in Scotland from age 12 to age 16, eventually earning glowing notices.&lt;ref name=mg&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', obituary, 1 May 1889, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gigs&gt;[http://www.operascotland.org/news/239/The+young+Carl+Rosa%27s+gigs+in+Scotland "The young Carl Rosa's gigs in Scotland"], Opera Scotland, September 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1859, he studied at the Conservatorium at [[Leipzig]] (where he met and became lifelong friends with [[Arthur Sullivan]])&lt;ref name=gigs/&gt; and, in 1862, in Paris.

In 1863, Rosa was appointed [[Konzertmeister]] at Hamburg, where he had occasional opportunities to conduct.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Legge, R. H., rev. John Rosselli. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24080 "Rosa, Carl August Nicholas (1842–1889)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 14 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Three years later he visited England, appearing as a soloist at [[the Crystal Palace]].  He had considerable success as a conductor both in England and the United States.  He travelled to America in 1866 as a member of a concert troupe promoted by the Baltimore impresario [[Hezekiah Linthicum Bateman]] that also included the Scottish operatic soprano [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa|Euphrosyne Parepa]].  During this tour, on 26 February 1867 in New York City, he married Parepa, who became known as ''Madame Parepa-Rosa''.&lt;ref name=rosa&gt;[http://www.carlrosaopera.co.uk/history/uk-ushistory.asp "American and British History"], www.carlrosaopera.co.uk, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carl Rosa 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Carl Rosa in a Jeremiah Gurney photograph]]
In 1869, in collaboration with the Chicago impresario C. D. Hess, the couple formed the Parepa Rosa English Opera Company in New York and toured in America for three seasons, with Parepa as the star and Rosa as the conductor.  It brought grand opera to places in America that had never seen any, performing Italian operas in English, which made them more accessible to American audiences.  In 1872, the Rosas returned to England and also visited Europe and Egypt.&lt;ref name=rosa/&gt;  Rosa changed the spelling of his name after he moved to England, where people took "Rose" as a monosyllable.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

==Carl Rosa Opera Company==
{{main|Carl Rosa Opera Company}}
In 1873 Rosa and his wife started the ''Carl Rosa Opera Company'' (the change in name reflecting her pregnancy) with a performance of [[William Vincent Wallace]]'s ''[[Maritana]]'' in [[Manchester]] on 1 September,&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Rosen, Carol. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04948 Carl Rosa Opera Company], Grove Music Online (subscription required), accessed 14 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and then toured England and Ireland. Rosa's policy was to present operas in English, and that remained the company's practice.&lt;ref name=klein&gt;"Mr. Carl Rosa and English Opera", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 21 June 1889, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Rosa invited the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] to write a libretto for Rosa to present as part of a planned 1874 season at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]]. Gilbert expanded one of the comic ''[[Bab Ballads]]'' that he had written for ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, W. S. [http://www.gsarchive.net/bab_ballads/html/trial.html ''Trial by Jury: An Operetta"], 11 April 1868, accessed at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 20 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; into a one-act libretto titled ''[[Trial by Jury]]''.&lt;ref name=js&gt;Stedman, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Parepa died in January 1874; Rosa dropped the project and cancelled his planned 1874 season.&lt;ref name=js/&gt;{{refn|In 1875, a competing manager, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], produced ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' with music by Arthur Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 125–128; Ainger, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Rosa later endowed a Parepa-Rosa scholarship at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London.  He married a second time in 1881. With his second wife, Josephine (d. 1927), he had four children.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

[[Image:Carl Rosa 2.png|Carl Rosa startled by the bogey of Italian Opera in an 1886 cartoon by [[Alfred Bryan (Illustrator)|Alfred Bryan]]|thumb|left]] 
The company's first London season opened at the [[Princess's Theatre, London|Princess's Theatre]] in September 1875, playing ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', with [[Charles Santley]] as Figaro and [[Rose Hersee]] as Susanna.  In 1876, Rosa staged a second London season, which featured the first performance in English of ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' with Santley in the title role.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  For the next fifteen years, under Rosa's guidance, the company prospered and earned good notices, with provincial tours and London seasons, frequently in conjunction with [[Augustus Harris]] at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  Such was the success of the company that at one point three Carl Rosa touring troupes were set up.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  Rosa hired [[Alberto Randegger]] as the musical director of the company from 1879 to 1885.  In 1880, [[George Grove]] wrote: "The careful way in which the pieces are put on the stage, the number of rehearsals, the eminence of the performers and the excellence of the performers have begun to bear their legitimate fruit, and the Carl Rosa Opera Company bids fair to become a permanent English institution."&lt;ref name=Brief&gt;[http://www.carlrosaopera.co.uk/history/index.asp "A Brief History"], carlrosaopera.co.uk, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1892, Rosa's Grand Opera Company gave a [[Royal Command Performance|command performance]] of ''[[La fille du régiment]]'' at [[Balmoral Castle]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;
  
Rosa introduced many works of important opera repertoire to England for the first time, performing some 150 different operas over the years.  Besides Santley and Hersee, [[Minnie Hauk]], [[Joseph Maas]], [[Barton McGuckin]] and [[Giulia Warwick]] were some of the famous singers associated with the company during its early years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlrosaopera.co.uk/history/opera-company.asp "The Performers"], carlrosaopera.co.uk, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Rosa also encouraged and supported new works by English composers. [[Frederic Hymen Cowen]]'s ''Pauline'' (1876), [[Arthur Goring Thomas]]'s ''[[Esmeralda (opera)|Esmeralda]]'' (1883), [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]]'s  ''Colomba'' (1883) and ''The Troubabour'', and [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]'s ''The Canterbury Pilgrims'' (1884) were commissioned by the company.  Earlier English operas by Wallace, [[Michael William Balfe|Balfe]] and [[Julius Benedict]] were also included in the company's repertoire.&lt;ref name=rosa/&gt;  An obituarist noted, "He had long looked forward to the time when Sir Arthur Sullivan would have undertaken a grand opera, and to the last had hoped to have been able to produce such a work."&lt;ref name=mg/&gt;  Shortly before his death, Rosa launched a light opera company that debuted with [[Robert Planquette]]'s ''Paul Jones''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

==Rosa's legacy==
Rosa died suddenly in Paris, on 30 April 1889,&lt;ref&gt;"Death of Carl Rosa", ''Daily Gazette For Middlesbrough'', 30 April 1889, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in [[Highgate Cemetery]], London.&lt;ref name=DGFM11&gt;"Carl Rosa's Funeral", ''Daily Gazette For Middlesbrough'', 6 May 1889, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Rosa's place in English music was indicated by the number of leading musicians who attended his funeral, including Sullivan, Stanford, Mackenzie and [[George Grove]], together with Richard D'Oyly Carte, [[George Edwardes]] and [[Augustus Harris]].&lt;ref name=DGFM11/&gt;

By the time he died, Rosa had demonstrated that English opera could be an artistic and financial success.  In a memorial lecture, the critic [[Herman Klein]] said of him, "From an artistic point of view he achieved triumph after triumph; he lifted English opera out of the slough of despond in which it was found in 1875."&lt;ref name=klein/&gt;  Both during his life and after his death, his company had much to do with popularizing opera in England, encouraging native composers and training many singers who went on to international careers.  His company survived his death and continued to perform opera in English until 1960.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  A new opera company, using the name, was revived in 1997 under the artistic direction of Peter Mulloy.  This company performs [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and other light operas, as well as [[grand opera]].&lt;ref name=Brief/&gt;

'''Club drugs''', also called '''rave drugs''', or '''party drugs''' are a loosely defined category of [[recreational drug]]s which are associated with [[discothèque]]s in the 1970s and [[nightclub]]s, [[dance club]]s, [[electronic dance music]] parties, and [[rave]]s in the 1980s to the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=6889 Erowid reference 6889] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302230707/http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=6889 |date=2008-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many other categories, such as [[opiate]]s, which are established according to pharmaceutical or chemical properties, club drugs are a "category of convenience", in which drugs are included due to the locations they are consumed and/or where the user goes while under the influence of the drugs. Club drugs are generally used by teens and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medlineplus.gov/clubdrugs.html |title=Club Drugs: MedlinePlus |author= |date= |website=medlineplus.gov |accessdate=22 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222115925/https://medlineplus.gov/clubdrugs.html |archive-date=22 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This group of drugs are also called "[[designer drug]]s", as most are synthesized in a chemical lab (e.g., MDMA, ketamine, LSD) rather than being sourced from plants (as with [[marijuana]], which comes from the [[cannabis]] plant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/script/main/mobileart-emh.asp?articlekey=59033 |title=What Are Club Drugs?

[[File:RaveOn.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Some club drug users take the drugs because they believe that the substances' effects enhance the experience of [[rave]] and [[electronic dance music]] clubs' pulsating lights, brightly colored projected images and massive sound systems with heavy [[bassline]]s.]]
Club drugs range from [[entactogens]] such as [[MDMA]] ("ecstasy"), [[2C-B]] ("nexus") and [[inhalant]]s (e.g., [[nitrous oxide]] and [[poppers]]) to [[stimulant]]s (e.g., [[amphetamine]] and [[cocaine]]), depressants/sedatives ([[Quaaludes]], [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]], [[Rohypnol]]) and [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] and hallucinogenic drugs ([[LSD]], [[magic mushrooms]] and [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]). Dancers at all-night parties and dance events have used some of these drugs for their stimulating properties since the 1960s [[Mod subculture]] in U.K., whose members took [[amphetamine]]s to stay up all night. In the 1970s disco scene, the club drugs of choice shifted to the stimulant cocaine and the depressant Quaaludes. Quaaludes were so common at disco clubs that the drug was nicknamed "disco biscuits". In the 1990s and 2000s, [[methamphetamine]]s and [[MDMA]] are sold and used in many clubs. "Club drugs" vary by country and region; in some regions, even [[opiates]] such as [[heroin]] and [[morphine]] have been sold at clubs, though this practice is relatively uncommon.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/p_5wpuls.txt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-06-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608082835/http://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/p_5wpuls.txt |archive-date=2008-06-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Narconon states that other synthetic drugs used in clubs, or which are sold as "Ecstasy" include [[harmaline]]; [[piperazines]] (e.g., [[Benzylpiperazine|BZP]] and [[TFMPP]]); [[para-Methoxyamphetamine|PMA]]/PMMA; [[mephedrone]] (generally used outside the US) and [[MDPV]].&lt;ref name="narconon.ca1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.narconon.ca/drug-abuse/club-drugs/effects.html |title=Club Drugs and Their Effects |author= |date= |website=Narconon International |accessdate=22 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131230457/http://www.narconon.ca/drug-abuse/club-drugs/effects.html |archive-date=31 January 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal status of club drugs varies according to the region and the drug. Some drugs are legal in some jurisdictions, such as "poppers" (which are often sold as "room deodorizer" or "leather polish" to get around drug laws) and nitrous oxide (which is legal when used from a whipped cream can). Other club drugs, such as amphetamine or MDMA are generally illegal, unless the individual has a lawful prescription from a doctor. Some club drugs are almost always illegal, such as [[cocaine]].

There are a range of risks from using club drugs. As with all drugs, from legal drugs like [[alcohol]] to illegal drugs like [[Benzylpiperazine|BZP]], usage can increase the risk of injury due to falls, dangerous or risky behavior (e.g., [[unsafe sex]]) and, if the user drives, injury or death due to [[impaired driving]] accidents. Some club drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, are addictive, and regular use can lead to the user craving more of the drug. Some club drugs are more associated with overdoses. Some club drugs can cause adverse health effects which can be harmful to the user, such as the dehydration associated with MDMA use in an all-night dance club setting.&lt;ref name="Tilstone Savage Clark 2006 p. 131"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tilstone |first=W.J. |last2=Savage |first2=K.A. |last3=Clark |first3=L.A. |title=Forensic Science: An Encyclopedia of History, Methods, and Techniques |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-57607-194-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIRQOssWbaoC&amp;pg=PA131 |access-date=7 August 2018 |page=131 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807053945/https://books.google.com/books?id=zIRQOssWbaoC&amp;pg=PA131 |archive-date=7 August 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Ecstasy ===
[[MDMA]] (ecstasy) is a popular club drug in the [[rave]] and [[electronic dance music]] scenes and in [[nightclub]]s. It is known under many nicknames, including "e" and "Molly". MDMA is often considered the drug of choice within the [[rave]] culture and is also used at clubs, festivals, [[house party|house parties]] and [[free party|free parties]] .&lt;ref name="pmid22392347"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carvalho M, Carmo H, Costa VM, Capela JP, Pontes H, Remião F, Carvalho F, Bastos Mde L |title=Toxicity of amphetamines: an update |journal=Arch. Toxicol. |volume=86 |issue=8 |pages=1167–1231 |date=August 2012 |pmid=22392347 |doi=10.1007/s00204-012-0815-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly [[Synergy|synergistic]] with the drug. The psychedelic quality of MDMA and its [[amphetamine]]-like energizing effect offers multiple reasons for its appeal to users in the rave setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as "party fuel" for all-night dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-92373-6 |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tGaRJiXe74UC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=Generation+Ecstasy+MDMA#v=onepage&amp;q=Generation%20Ecstasy%20MDMA&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDMA is taken by users less frequently than other stimulants, typically less than once per week.&lt;ref name=Epstein2013&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=edited by Barbara S. McCrady, Elizabeth E. |title=Addictions : a comprehensive guidebook |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-975366-6 |page=299 |edition=Second |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MUYfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effects include "[g]reater enjoyment of dancing", "[d]istortions of perceptions, particularly light, music and touch"; and "[a]rtificial feelings of empathy and emotional warmth".&lt;ref name="narconon.ca1"/&gt; MDMA is sometimes taken in conjunction with other psychoactive drugs, such as [[LSD]], [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]],
[[psilocybin mushroom]]s and [[2C-B]]. Users sometimes use [[menthol]]ated products while taking MDMA for its cooling sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.drugabuse.gov/DirReports/DirRep500/DirectorReport5.html |title=Director's Report to the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse |publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse |date=May 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203222445/http://archives.drugabuse.gov/DirReports/DirRep500/DirectorReport5.html |archivedate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stimulants ===
{{Main|Stimulant}}[[File:Blue Crystal Meth.jpg|thumb|left|120px|A blue form of [[crystal meth]].]]
A number of stimulants are used as club drugs. Various [[amphetamines]] and [[methamphetamines]] are used as stimulants, as is [[cocaine]]. These drugs enable clubgoers to dance all night. Cocaine is a powerful nervous system stimulant.&lt;ref name=WHO2004&gt;{{cite book |author=World Health Organization |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9OhG-dZdAwC&amp;pg=PA89 |title=Neuroscience of psychoactive substance use and dependence |page=89 |isbn=9789241562355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its effects can last from fifteen or thirty minutes to an hour. The duration of cocaine's effects depends on the amount taken and the route of administration.&lt;ref name=WHO2007&gt;{{cite book |author=World Health Organization |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ptVjyRs7AdsC&amp;pg=PA242 |title=International medical guide for ships |page=242 |isbn=9789241547208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cocaine can be in the form of fine white powder, bitter to the taste. When inhaled or injected, it causes a numbing effect. Cocaine increases alertness, feelings of well-being and [[euphoria]], energy and motor activity, feelings of competence and sexuality. Cocaine's stimulant effects are similar to that of [[amphetamine]], however, these effects tend to be much shorter lasting and more prominent.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== Depressants/sedatives ===
{{Main|Sedative}}

[[File:Quaalude.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A variety of Quaalude pills and capsules.]]
[[Methaqualone]] (Quaaludes) became increasingly popular as a [[recreational drug]] in the late 1960s and 1970s, known variously as "ludes" or "sopers" (also "soaps") in the U.S. and "mandrakes" and "mandies" in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The drug was often used by hippies and by people who went dancing at [[glam rock]] clubs in the 1970s and at [[Discothèque|discos]] (one slang term for Quaaludes in the disco era was "disco biscuits").  In the mid-1970s, there were bars in Manhattan called "juice bars" that only served non-alcoholic drinks that catered to people who liked to dance on methaqualone.&lt;ref name="lude 1"&gt;{{cite web |title=METHAQUALONE |url=http://www.drugtext.org/Recreational-Drugs/methaqualone.html |work=Drug Text |publisher=International Substance Use Library |accessdate=27 July 2012 |author=Lawrence Young |date=31 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423045455/https://www.drugtext.org/Recreational-Drugs/methaqualone.html |archive-date=23 April 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Purported methaqualone is in a significant minority of cases found to be inert, or contain diphenhydramine or benzodiazepines.

The depressant [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]] (also used by assailants as a [[date rape drug]], in which case they slip it into a victim's drink) is intentionally taken by some users as a party drug and club drug.

[[Rohypnol]] (also used as a [[date rape drug]]) is a sedative/hypnotic that causes intoxication and impairs [[cognitive]] functions. This may appear as lack of concentration, [[confusion]] and [[anterograde amnesia]]. It can be described as a [[hangover]]-like effect which can persist to the next day.&lt;ref name=Residual2004&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vermeeren A. |year=2004 |title=Residual effects of hypnotics: epidemiology and clinical implications |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=297–328 |pmid=15089115 |doi=10.2165/00023210-200418050-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also impairs psychomotor functions similar to other benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[hypnotic]] drugs.&lt;ref name="Mets-2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mets |first1=MA. |last2=Volkerts |first2=ER. |last3=Olivier |first3=B. |last4=Verster |first4=JC. |title=Effect of hypnotic drugs on body balance and standing steadiness |journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews |volume=14 |date=February 2010 |issue=4 |pages=259–67 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2009.10.008 |pmid=20171127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previously mentioned selection of drugs are generally categorized as club drugs by the media and the [[United States]] government, this distinction probably does not have an accurate correlation to real usage patterns. For example, [[alcoholic beverages]] ([[beer]], [[wine]], [[hard liquor]]) is generally not included under the category of club drugs, even though it is probably used more than any other drug at clubs, particularly those that are liquor-licensed [[nightclub]]s or [[bar]]s.

Not to be confused with psychoactive drugs, such as [[stimulant]]s and [[opioid]]s, which induce states of altered consciousness, psychedelics tend to affect the mind in ways that result in the experience being qualitatively different from those of ordinary consciousness. Whereas stimulants cause an energized feeling and opiates produce a dreamy, relaxed state, the [[psychedelic experience]] is often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as [[trance]], [[meditation]], [[yoga]], [[religious ecstasy]], [[dream]]ing and even [[near-death experience]]s.  With a few exceptions, most psychedelic drugs fall into one of the three following families of chemical compounds; [[tryptamine]]s, [[phenethylamine]]s, and [[lysergamides]]. Many psychedelic drugs are illegal worldwide under the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs|UN conventions]] unless used in a medical or religious context. Despite these regulations, recreational use of psychedelics is common, including at [[rave]]s and EDM concerts and festivals.

=== Inhalants ===
{{Main|Inhalants}}
[[File:HOpoppers.jpg|thumb|right|A selection of small bottles of poppers, a volatile drug inhaled at dance clubs for the "rush" it can provide.]]

"[[Poppers]]" are small bottles of volatile drugs which are inhaled by clubgoers for the "rush" or "high" that they can create. Nitrites such as [[alkyl nitrite]] originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open, which led to the nickname "poppers." The drug became popular in the US first on the [[disco]]/club scene of the 1970s, where dancers used the drug for the "rush" it provides, and because it was perceived to enhance the experience of dancing to loud, bass-heavy disco. The drug became popular again in the mid-1980s and 1990s [[rave]] and [[electronic dance music]] scenes. As with disco clubgoers, rave participants and EDM enthusiasts used the drug because its "rush" or "high" was perceived to enhance the experience of dancing to pulsating music and lights.

[[Recreational use of nitrous oxide|Nitrous oxide]] is a [[dissociative]] [[inhalant]] that can cause [[depersonalisation]], [[derealisation]] (feeling like the world is not real), [[dizziness]], [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], and some sound distortion ([[flanging]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Giannini |first=A. J. |year=1991 |title=Volatiles |page=396 |editor-last=Miller |editor-first=N. S. |url=https://books.google.com/books?doi=VgetLfJBQv0C&amp;pg=PA396 |booktitle=Comprehensive Handbook of Drug and Alcohol Addiction |place=New York |publisher=Marcel Dekker |isbn=978-0-8247-8474-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, it may cause slight [[hallucination]]s and have a mild [[aphrodisiac]] effect.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} While medical grade nitrous oxide is only available to dentists and other licensed health care providers, recreational users often obtain the drug by inhaling the nitrous oxide used in whipped cream aerosol cans. Nitrous oxide users also buy small "whippet" canisters of nitrous oxide intended for use in restaurant whipped cream dispensers and then "crack" open these canisters to inhale the gas. Users typically transfer the gas to a plastic bag or balloon prior to inhaling it.

=== Ketamine ===
[[File:G 'o' K.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ketamine from the street drug trade, in the form of crystals.]]
[[Ketamine]], a [[dissociative anesthetic]], has a long history of being used in clubs and was one of the most popular substances used in the New York [[club kids|Club Kid]] scene.  Ketamine produces a dissociative state, characterized by a sense of detachment from one's physical body and the external world which is known as [[depersonalization]] and [[derealization]]. Effects include hallucinations, changes in the perception of distances, relative scale, color and durations/time, as well as a slowing of the visual system's ability to update what the user is seeing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

=== Other ===
In the 2000s, synthetic [[phenethylamines]] such as [[2C-I]], [[2C-B]] and [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine|DOB]] have been referred to as club drugs due to their stimulating and psychedelic nature (and their chemical relationship with [[MDMA]]).&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/onelife/drink_drugs/2ci/ BBC-2C-I] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012081433/http://www.bbc.co.uk/onelife/drink_drugs/2ci/ |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 2012, derivates of the psychedelic 2C-X drugs, the [[NBOMe]]s and especially [[25I-NBOMe]], had become common at raves in Europe. The drug organization Norconon states that other synthetic drugs used in clubs, or which are sold as "Ecstasy" include [[harmaline]]; [[piperazines]] (e.g., [[Benzylpiperazine|BZP]] and [[TFMPP]]); [[para-Methoxyamphetamine|PMA]]/PMMA; [[mephedrone]] (generally used outside the US) and [[MDPV]].&lt;ref name="narconon.ca1"/&gt;

Though far less common than other "club drugs" like MDMA, ketamine, or [[LSD]], [[heroin]] can be found in some of New York City's clubs. Marijuana and related cannabis products are used by some clubgoers; for example, some Rohypnol and ketamine users mix the powdered drug with marijuana and smoke it.&lt;ref name="narconon.ca1" /&gt;

== Effects ==
{{medical citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}

=== Desired effects ===
Although each club drug has different effects, their use in clubs reflects their perceived contribution to the user's experience dancing to a beat as lights flash to the music. Club drug users are generally taking the drugs to "enhance social intimacy and sensory stimulation" from the dance club experience.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Gahlinger, Paul. "Club Drugs: MDMA, Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB), Rohypnol, and Ketamine". In Am Fam Physician. 2004 Jun 1;69(11):2619-2627.&lt;/ref&gt; Some club drugs' popularity stems from their ability to induce [[euphoria]], lowered inhibition and an intoxicated feeling. Some drugs, such as amphetamine and cocaine, give the dancer hyperactivity and energy to dance all night. Many drugs produce a feeling of heightened physical sensation, and increased libido and sexual pleasure. Some club drugs, such as LSD, DMT, MDMA, 2C-B and ketamine enhance the experience of being in a nightclub with pulsating lights and flashing lasers and throbbing dance music, because they cause hallucinations or unusual perception effects.

=== Risks and adverse effects ===
Although research continues into the full scope of the effects of illegal drugs, regular and unsafe use of club drugs is widely accepted to have damaging side effects and carry a risk of addiction. Increased heart rate, a steep increase in body temperature, increase in blood pressure, spasms and dehydration are all common side effects of MDMA and methamphetamine. Breathing and respiratory issues, drowsiness, nausea and confusion are common side effects of said drugs. They can also make the user anxious, stressed and panicked, or even hallucinate. Withdrawal is also a risk with many club drugs. Drug cravings as the chemical leaves the user's body can be complicated by sleep deprivation, dehydration and hypoglycaemia to result in debilitating 'come downs' which can result in depression-like symptoms. In the worst instance, club drugs result in the death of the user from cardiac arrest or water intoxication due to the increase in heart rate and thirstiness induced. Inconsistency in the strength and exact composition of the supplied drug causing users to overdose. Wide variance in the measured rate of deaths caused by drugs such as ecstasy across countries suggest that user and societal/environmental factors may also affect the lethality of club drugs.

==== Drug interactions ====
[[File:Drug addicted in Tallinn tram.JPG|thumb|right|160px|An unconscious teen on a tram car.]]
Another risk is drug interactions. Some club drug users take multiple drugs at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art32407.html |title=Club Drugs and Their Effects |author= |date= |website=thebody.com |accessdate=22 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322204637/http://www.thebody.com/content/art32407.html |archive-date=22 March 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Club drugs often are taken together, with alcohol, or with other drugs to enhance their effect."&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Drug interactions can cause hazardous side effects. When club drug users are in a liquor-licensed [[nightclub]], users may mix pills or powders (MDMA, 2C-B, GHB, ketamine) with consumption of [[alcoholic drinks]] such as beer, wine or hard liquor. Some depressants, such as [[Rohypnol]], are dangerous to take while drinking alcohol. "Ketamine often is taken in "trail mixes" of methamphetamine, phencyclidine, cocaine, sildenafil citrate (Viagra), morphine or heroin."&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

==== Injury or death due to risky behaviour ====
Another risk with club drugs is one shared by all drugs, from legal drugs like [[alcohol]] to abused over-the-counter drugs (taking large amounts of [[dextromethorphan]] cough syrup) and illegal drugs ([[Benzylpiperazine|BZP]], [[amphetamine]]s, etc.): while impaired, the user is more likely to be injured, engage in dangerous or risky behaviour (e.g., [[unsafe sex]]) or, if she or he drives, have an accident resulting in injury or death due to [[impaired driving]].

==== Misrepresentation ====
[[File:Bzptablet.jpg|right|thumb|120px|A tablet sold as MDMA. It contained no MDMA; instead, it contained [[benzylpiperazine]] (BZP), [[methamphetamine]], and [[caffeine]].]]
In many cases, illegal club drugs are misrepresented.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; That is, a dealer will tell a purchaser that she/he has a certain illegal drug for sale, while in fact the dealer's pills, capsules or bags of powder do not contain that chemical. For example, MDMA ("ecstasy") is very hard to synthesize in illegal underground labs, and methamphetamine is much easier (it can be made from household chemicals and over-the-counter cold remedies containing [[pseudoephedrine]]). As such, what dealers sell as MDMA is often methamphetamine powder. Similarly, pills sold by drug dealers as [[LSD]], a drug which only the top chemists have the training to synthesize, most often contain no LSD; instead, they often contain [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], a veterinary tranquilizer which produces disassociation and hallucinations in humans. In some cases, the dealer has intentionally substituted a less expensive, more available illegal drug for another drug. In other cases, the substitution was made by a higher-level drug cartel or organization, and the dealer may in fact believe that the bogus product is MDMA or LSD.

==== "Cutting", adulteration and "spiking" ====
[[File:Flavcocaine.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Baggies of cocaine adulterated with fruit-flavoured powder and colouring.]]
With the exception of [[marijuana]], which typically is uncut and unlaced, many illegal drugs, especially those which come in a powder or pill form are "cut" with other substances or "spiked" with other drugs.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Cocaine, amphetamines and other stimulants often have [[caffeine]] powder added, as this increases the dealer's profit by bulking out the powder, so that less expensive cocaine or amphetamine has to be used in making the product. Some substances used to "cut" illegal drugs are not inherently harmful, as they are just used to "pad" or "bulk out" a quantity of the illegal drug and increase profits, such as [[lactose]] (milk sugar), a white powder often added to [[heroin]]. Even fairly innocuous powders that are added to illegal drugs, though, can have adverse effects with some routes of illegal drug administration, such as injection.  With some drugs, adulterants are sometimes added to make the product more appealing. For example, "flavoured cocaine" has flavoured powder added to the drug.

Whereas the main goal of "cutting" is to bulk out a quantity of pure, expensive illegal drugs with an innocuous and not overly harmful substance ([[lactose]]) or fairly low-impact product (e.g., caffeine in amphetamine pills), the goal of "spiking" is to try to make lower-quality illegal drug or a lower-potency source of illegal drugs give the user the type of "high" or psychedelic experience she or he is seeking. While it was earlier stated that marijuana is most often uncut and un-spiked, some dealers add PCP to marijuana (this is nicknamed "wet marijuana"), because adding this disassociative psychedelic to low-grade, low-THC marijuana can convert it into a cannabis that creates striking hallucinogenic effects. Drug researchers learned that some dealers were spiking marijuana when they tested US teens who stated that they had only used a single illegal drug (marijuana) and the teens tested positive for marijuana and PCP. Some dealers who have a very small quantity of MDMA powder to sell "spike" it with less expensive and easier to produce methamphetamine powder.
* Street cocaine is often adulterated or "cut" with [[talc]], [[lactose]], [[sucrose]], [[glucose]], [[mannitol]], [[inositol]], [[caffeine]], [[procaine]], [[phencyclidine]], [[phenytoin]], [[lignocaine]], [[strychnine]], [[amphetamine]], or [[heroin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=VV Pillay |title=Modern Medical Toxicology |edition=4th |year=2013 |publisher=Jaypee |isbn=978-93-5025-965-8 |pages=553–554}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A common methamphetamine adulterant is [[dimethyl sulfone]], a solvent and cosmetic base without known effect on the nervous system; other adulterants include [[dimethylamphetamine]] HCl, ephedrine HCl, [[sodium thiosulfate]], [[sodium chloride]], [[sodium glutamate]], and a mixture of [[caffeine]] with [[sodium benzoate]].&lt;ref name="Inoue"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jhs.pharm.or.jp/data/54%286%29/54_615.pdf |format=PDF |title=Characterization and Profiling of Methamphetamine Seizures |author=Hiroyuki Inoue ''et al.

==== Addiction ====
Not all club drugs are addictive (e.g. nitrous oxide). However, some club drugs are addictive. [[Amphetamine]] heavily used in recreational fashion pose a risk of [[addiction]].&lt;ref name="NHM-Addiction doses"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |editor=Sydor A, Brown RY |title=Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience |year=2009 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-148127-4 |page=368 |edition=2nd |chapter=Chapter 15: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders |quote=Such agents also have important therapeutic uses; cocaine, for example, is used as a local anesthetic (Chapter 2), and amphetamines and methylphenidate are used in low doses to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and in higher doses to treat narcolepsy (Chapter 12). Despite their clinical uses, these drugs are strongly reinforcing, and their long-term use at high doses is linked with potential addiction, especially when they are rapidly administered or when high-potency forms are given.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cocaine addiction]] is a psychological desire to use [[cocaine]] regularly. Cocaine overdose may result in cardiovascular and [[brain damage]], such as: [[Vasoconstriction|constricting blood vessels]] in the brain, causing [[stroke]]s and constricting arteries in the heart; causing [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/cocaine-use-and-its-effects |title=Cocaine: How It Works, Effects, and Risks |author= |date= |website=webmd.com |accessdate=22 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227105910/http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/cocaine-use-and-its-effects |archive-date=27 February 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cocaine creates euphoria and high amounts of energy. If taken in large, unsafe doses, it is possible to cause [[mood swings]], [[paranoia]], [[insomnia]], [[psychosis]], [[high blood pressure]], a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], [[panic attacks]], [[Cognitive dysfunction|cognitive impairments]] and drastic changes in personality. The symptoms of cocaine withdrawal (also known as [[Comedown (drugs)|''comedown or crash'']]) range from moderate to severe: [[dysphoria]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[weakness|psychological and physical weakness]], [[pain]], and compulsive [[Craving (withdrawal)|cravings]].

==== Ketamine risks ====
Ketamine use as a recreational drug has been implicated in deaths globally, with more than 90 deaths in England and Wales in the years of 2005–2013.&lt;ref name=DalyVice14 /&gt; They include accidental poisonings, drownings, traffic accidents, and suicides.&lt;ref name=DalyVice14&gt;See Max Daly, 2014, "The Sad Demise of Nancy Lee, One of Britain's Ketamine Casualties," at ''Vice'' (online), July 23, 2014, see [https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/ketamine-slowly-ruins-your-bladder-and-kills-you-863] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607022331/http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/ketamine-slowly-ruins-your-bladder-and-kills-you-863 |date=2015-06-07 }}, accessed 7 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of deaths were among young people.&lt;ref name=TheCrownONS13&gt;The Crown, 2013, "Drug related deaths involving ketamine in England and Wales," a report of the Mortality team, Life Events and Population Sources Division, Office for National Statistics, the Crown (U.K.), see [http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/business-transparency/freedom-of-information/what-can-i-request/published-ad-hoc-data/health/october-2013/drug-related-deaths-involving-ketamine-by-age-group.xls] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607212436/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/business-transparency/freedom-of-information/what-can-i-request/published-ad-hoc-data/health/october-2013/drug-related-deaths-involving-ketamine-by-age-group.xls |date=2015-06-07 }} and [https://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-health3/deaths-related-to-drug-poisoning/2012/stb---deaths-related-to-drug-poisoning-2012.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619235310/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-health3/deaths-related-to-drug-poisoning/2012/stb---deaths-related-to-drug-poisoning-2012.html |date=2015-06-19 }}, accessed 7 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to increased regulation (e.g., upgrading ketamine from a Class C to a Class B banned substance in the U.K.).&lt;ref name=DixonTelegraph14&gt;Hayley Dixon, 2014, "Ketamine death of public schoolgirl an 'act of stupidity which destroyed family'," at ''The Telegraph'' (online), February 12, 2014, see [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10633700/Ketamine-death-of-public-schoolgirl-an-act-of-stupidity-which-destroyed-family.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824233230/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10633700/Ketamine-death-of-public-schoolgirl-an-act-of-stupidity-which-destroyed-family.html |date=2017-08-24 }}, accessed 7 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; At sufficiently high doses, Ketamine users may experience what is called the "[[K-hole]]", a state of extreme dissociation with visual and auditory hallucinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Giannini |first=AJ |title=Drug Abuse |publisher=Health Information Press |location=Los Angeles |year=1999 |page=104 |isbn=978-1-885987-11-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acute treatment ==
[[File:Woodstock festival medical.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A music fan who has had a drug overdose at the [[Woodstock Music Festival]] is placed onto a wheeled cot by paramedics.]]
The main treatment for individuals facing acute medical issues due to club drug consumption or overdoses is "cardiorespiratory maintenance".&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Since club drug users may have consumed multiple drugs, a mix of drugs and alcohol, or a drug adulterated with other chemicals, it is hard for doctors to know what type of overdose to treat for, even if the user is conscious and can tell the medical team what drug they think they took. A doctor recommends "cardiac monitoring, pulse oximetry, urinalysis, and performance of a comprehensive chemistry panel to check for electrolyte imbalance, renal toxicity, and possible underlying disorders" and preventing "seizures".&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Some doctors use [[activated charcoal]] and a [[cathartic]]" to detoxify the drugs in the gastrointestinal system.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Cooling the victim is recommended to avoid hyperthermia. If the victim overdosed on Rohypnol, the antidote [[flumazenil]] can be given; this is the only club drug for which there is an antidote.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== History ==
In the mid to late-1970s [[disco]] club scene, there was a thriving drug subculture, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud dance music and the flashing lights on the dancefloor. Substances such as [[cocaine]]&lt;ref&gt;Gootenberg, Paul (1954). ''Between Coca and Cocaine: A Century or More of'', pp. 119–150. He says that, "The relationship of cocaine to 1970s disco culture cannot be stressed enough; ...".&lt;/ref&gt; (nicknamed "blow"), amyl nitrite ("[[poppers]]"),&lt;ref&gt;Amyl, butyl and isobutyl nitrite (collectively known as alkyl nitrites) are clear, yellow liquids which are inhaled for their intoxicating effects. Nitrites originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open. This led to nitrites being given the name 'poppers' but this form of the drug is rarely found in the UK The drug became popular in the UK first on the disco/club scene of the 1970s and then at dance and rave venues in the 1980s and 1990s. Available at: {{cite web |url=http://www.drugscope.org.uk/druginfo/drugsearch/ds_results.asp?file=%5Cwip%5C11%5C1%5C1%5Cnitrites.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405132026/http://www.drugscope.org.uk/druginfo/drugsearch/ds_results.asp?file=%5Cwip%5C11%5C1%5C1%5Cnitrites.html |archivedate=2007-04-05 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quaalude]]s. Quaaludes were described as [the] "...other quintessential 1970s club drug", which suspends [[motor coordination]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1999/7/1999_7_43.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205223044/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1999/7/1999_7_43.shtml |archivedate=2010-02-05 |df=}} – 76k -&lt;/ref&gt;) According to [[Peter Braunstein]], "massive quantities of drugs were ingested in discothèques."

Throughout the 1980s, the use of club drugs expanded into colleges, social parties, and raves. As raves grew in popularity through the late 1980s and into the late 1990s, drug usage, especially [[MDMA]], grew with them. Much like discos, raves made use of flashing lights, loud [[techno]]/[[electronic dance music]] to enhance the user experience. Before their scheduling, some club drugs (especially [[designer drug]]s referred to as [[research chemical]]s) were advertised as alcohol-free and drug-free. Another reason that drug producers create new drugs is to avoid drug laws.

== In Australia ==
Club drugs are used in Australia in a variety of dance clubs and nightclubs. One in ten Australians has used MDMA at least once in their lifetime; one in thirty have used MDMA in the past 12 months. One in a hundred Australians has used ketamine at least once in their lives and a total of five hundred in the past 12 months. One in two hundred Australians have used GHB at least once in their lives and one in one thousand in the past 12 months. Regarding the entire Australian population, seven per cent of Australians have used cocaine at least once in their lifetime and two per cent of Australians have used it in the past 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;Australia Defence Force (ADF), n.d).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010-era generations, from teens to young adults and mature-aged people, these drugs are commonly used and sold in nightclubs and pubs throughout Australia.

Since the breakup of [[the Beatles]] in 1970, the former members of the band have been involved in various collaborations with one other, including:
*Album and single recordings involving more than one ex-Beatle (as musicians or in other roles such as producer);
*Live performances.
These are listed in the tables below. Collaborations that began before the breakup are included for historical interest. The start date of the act of collaboration, e.g., the recording start date, governs the initial display sequence. Other display sequences may be seen by clicking the buttons in the column headers. None of the albums, performances or singles featured all four members at the same time before [[John Lennon]]'s death. Collaborations between any two of the four members were not uncommon.

'''Dan W. Quinn''' (November 1860 &amp;ndash; November 7, 1938) was one of the first American singers to become popular in the new medium of recorded music. Quinn was a very successful [[recording artist]] whose career spanned 1892 to 1918. Quinn recorded many of his hits in the legendary [[Tin Pan Alley]] of New York City.

==Biography==

Dan W. Quinn was born in 1860 in New York City.&lt;ref name=Gracyk /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoffmann2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Richard (2015), notes to CD "Dan W. Quinn Anthology," Archeophone ARCH 5505&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|His obituary in ''Variety'' gives his birthplace as New York.&lt;ref name=Variety1938/&gt;}} His family moved to San Francisco when he was a child, but returned to New York in the 1870s (leading to later confusion as to his birthplace). He began singing in the choir of the [[Church of the Heavenly Rest]] (Episcopal) as a child. As a young adult, he worked as an ironworker and moonlighted as a singer at local functions in the New York area.

"Discovered" at one of these functions in January 1892, Quinn made his first recording in New York and quickly achieved success. Limitations of technology at the time meant that not all voices were suitable to be recorded; Quinn's voice was one that recorded well.&lt;ref name=HoffmannCooper/&gt; He assisted Thomas Edison in the laboratory as Edison made modifications to the talking machine, to make it also a singing machine. Edison described him as "the man with the perfect voice."&lt;ref&gt;New York Sun obituary, 07Nov1938&lt;/ref&gt; He sang for all the major record labels of his day, including [[Berliner Gramophone|Berliner]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[Edison Records|Edison]], [[Gramophone Company|Gramophone]], [[Paramount Records|Paramount]] and [[Victor Talking Machine|Victor]].  In 1898, Columbia signed him to a year-long exclusive contract, but within days of its expiration he was making a record for Berliner.&lt;ref name=Gracyk/&gt; Over his career, Quinn recorded many popular songs and cut an estimated 2,500 titles.&lt;ref name=Hoffmann2004/&gt; He sang "Molly and I and the Baby" more than a thousand times in about two weeks, using the pre-electricity trumpet technology of the early 1890s:&lt;ref&gt;NYSun obit&lt;/ref&gt; the singer sang into the large end of a megaphone, which physically stimulated the stylus on the rotating cylinder. The companies had limited duplication capability, so if they wanted a hundred copies, the singer had to perform the song many times. For one take, Edison obtained an orchestra to accompany Quinn and kept that copy in his laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;July 1977 letter from Quinn's older daughter Lidie Q. Hunsberger to Robert Ziegler, a son of a cousin.&lt;/ref&gt; 

At age 22 Quinn married 15-year-old Mary Jane Ritchie, known to the family as Jennie. They had six children: Dan Jr, Ritchie, Arthur (who died in infancy), Mary, known as Lidie (later Hunsberger), Jane (Manderson), and Frank. They lived in a reconstructed mansion on W 20th St, near 10th Ave until about 1898, when they moved to 442 W 24th St, in a row of two-story houses known as Chelsea cottages. Later, in response to Jennie's inability to use stairs due to worsening rheumatism, they moved to a flat at 312 W 20th St. Quinn retired from recording in 1906, but continued to work in vaudeville.&lt;ref name=Gracyk/&gt; as well clubs, concerts, and occasionally comic opera. He briefly returned to recording in 1915 to 1918, but went back into retirement soon after. Although retired from singing, he worked extensively booking concerts and shows, including two large ones held the week he died.

Dan Quinn died of intestinal cancer at the W 20th St apartment in New York on November 7, 1938 at age 79.

'''Dirty Slippers''' is a Hungarian pop-rock band from [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]], Hungary. The band celebrated its 10 Year Anniversary in 2015.  The still very young members began to play in concerts as teenagers, and thanks to the luck and hard work they became famous in 2009 with their hit “Élned kell”, which also became the advertising song of the Hungarian campaign against [[cervical cancer]].   The music video hits came after, like “Te vagy a Fény”, “Hang vagy Jel”, which song was hummed by the whole country, and “Egy a vége”. In 2012 appeared the [[LP album|LP]] Közel Hozzád, which was recorded in the USA with [[George Shilling]], the producer of Madonna and Oasis. The LP made it to the Hit List of [[MAHASZ]] on the first week. The fan base of the band suddenly increased, because from 2009 until the present day Dirty Slippers is the opening act of [[Republic]], in arenas and festivals too. Three European tours guaranteed the international success of the band. First with [[The Coronas]], which is the favorite band of the Beatles-frontman [[Paul McCartney]], then with the Romanian legend [[Rezident EX]], and last time with the star band [[The Last Vegas]], discovered by [[Guns N’ Roses]]. Together they conquered the European clubs with crowded audience. The Hungarian press wrote about this tour many times like this: “Dirty Slippers stands on the doorstep of worldwide success.”

The overwhelming success of live concerts, the hits, and the plenty more fans from every ages helped Dirty Slippers to become one of the most searched bands in Hungary by 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6610">'''Doyama''' ({{lang-ja|堂山町, Dōyama-chō}}) is a district in the [[Umeda]] area of [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. It is close to the JR Osaka and Umeda Station, many restaurants, bars, izakaya, karaoke, massage parlors, host clubs, hotels, and shops concentrate in the area.  Many salary-men, OL (office ladies) and students stop by Doyama-cho to have fun in the evening before they go back home.  It is one of the largest party towns in Japan. Recently, this area has attracted gay communities, and now Doyama-cho is also known for its [[gay scene]].

==Location and History==
It is about 500m east from [[Japan Railways|JR]] [[Osaka Station]] and 300m east from [[Hankyu]], [[Hanshin Main Line|Hanshin]] and Subway [[Umeda station]].  The area is called "[[Kita-ku, Osaka|Kita]]" or north of Osaka, and best known as a party town.  There are three main streets in Doyama-Cho; Hankyu Higashi Dori Shotengai (Hankyu's Eastside Mall), Hankyu Higashi Naka Dori (Hankyu's Eastside Central Mall)and Park Avenue Doyama.  There are a lot of business offices and business hotels in south side of Doyama-Cho.  North side of Doyama-Cho started becoming a gay community in last 20–30 years. 

There were lots of luxury Japanese restaurants, sushi places, [[cabaret]] and Jazz clubs targeting high-end business customers until the bubble economy burst of the early 90s.  However, since the real estate bubble crashed and many business headquarters have moved to Tokyo area, Osaka's economy lost its momentum.  Many high-end bars or restaurants could not keep their business.  Many usual restaurants, izakaya, pubs or adult entertainment businesses started their business to target general salary-man, OLs or students.

Recently, many tourists from foreign countries visit Doyama-cho which is introduced as an entertainment district in many travel guide books, where are, amongst others, convenience hotels, such as Hotel Kinki which attracts many foreign visitors.

Doyama-Cho also attracted gay communities.  "Hokuou-Kan", one of the most popular sauna places, became very popular, and because of its convenient location, Doyama-Cho became a hub of gay community in West Japan.  However, unlike in Western gay towns, the gay community does not want to interact with the general public and Doyama-Cho's neighborhood association still hesitates to mark Doyama-Cho as a gay friendly community.

==The Center of Gay Scene in West Japan==
Besides bars, the area is also home to restaurants and cafes, shops, [[sauna]]s, hotels, "[[Host club|host bars or club]]s" (bars where patrons can meet [[gay slang|hustlers]]), [[massage parlour]]s, and [[brothel]]s of varying sizes and legality. Establishments vary in size, but many are limited to ten or fewer seats.

=== Doyama Scene ===
Much like in Tokyo, bars here are usually themed towards "types" - bears, salarymen, young guys etc. Many of the gay bars in Doyama do not permit female customers. The few lesbian bars that can be found do not permit male customers. Mixed venues are few.  

At most bars in this area, patrons usually sit at a counter and chat with the bartender. Karaoke is also popular, and gay monthly and pornographic magazines can be read at many establishments as well. Those who visit these small bars are usually regulars; since many bars operate on the "[[bottle keep]]" system, many customers may have their own bottle at their favourite bar. Loyalty to bars is returned by the bars organizing outings to [[onsen]], [[hanami]] parties, picnics, gay sporting events, and so on. Many bars maintain large photo albums of customers, for customers, often taken at such events.  

While most bar owners ([[mama-san|"Mamas"]] or "Masters") are accommodating to new customers and to non-Japanese, the scene is largely geared towards regular, Japanese-speaking customers, and some venues discourage or prohibit non-Japanese from entering, regardless of their Japanese language abilities. A handful of establishments, in contrast, specifically target foreigners with advertising and information in English. These include Bar Physique and FrenZy Bar. While most bars have a cover charge system, these do not. 

With the advent of the internet and less segregation, Doyama is seeing a downturn in gay visitors. While weekends are busy, foreign visitors should not expect the same numbers as one would expect in a city of this size in the West. In recent times, more bars have opened aimed at straight men.

===Rainbow Parade===
While Tokyo has been the site of numerous gay pride parades over the past 20 years, Osaka has lagged in this regard. Finally, October 22, 2006 saw the inaugural Rainbow Parade, with more than 900 participants marching from Nakanoshima Park to Motomachi-Naka Park, near Namba Station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansaiscene.com/2006_10/html/events.shtml/ Kansai Scene Magazine :: Event Listings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929211726/http://www.kansaiscene.com/2006_10/html/events.shtml/ |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th annual parade will take place on October 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://rainbowfesta.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/RAINBOW-FESTA-402098639894174/&lt;/ref&gt;

===PLus===

Mash (Men and Sexual Health Osaka) organize a yearly event called PLus+ promoting AIDS awareness. Taking place in Ogimachi Park, close to the Doyama area, there is entertainment and drinks available. Organisers estimate more than 10,000 people participated in the 2007 event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanvisitor.com/index.php?cID=362&amp;pID=1558&amp;cName=Gay&amp;pName=osaka-plus-07]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the event falls on Sunday, October 12.

Enteng Kabisote ([[Vic Sotto]]) wants to retire as the perennial hero of Engkantasya and have a normal life with his family without the magical elements. Ina Montecillo ([[Ai-Ai delas Alas]]) longs to have the right partner to be with her for the rest of her life.

One day, Enteng is placed under a powerful evil spell by Engkantasya's evil fairy Satana to fall in love with another woman. And when he meets Ina, he exerts all the effort Ina to fall for him. Ina, on the other hand, slowly opens her heart for this new opportunity of love.

Enteng then tries his best to be a father to Ina's children even if they are not fully supportive of him. But when their relationship gets serious, Ina discovers the truth – Enteng already has a family.

After discovering the truth of Enteng's family and the evil spell casted upon Enteng was worn off, Ina's family teamed up with Enteng's family to fight off Satana and her minions for what she had done as Ina Magenta gives Ina Montecillo some of their powers to fight her.

However at the arrival of both Tirso "Pip" Montecillo (Alwyn Uytingco) and Aiza Kabisote ([[Aiza Seguerra]]), both Enteng and Ina scolds them for being late and to their horrible shock that Pip accidentally impregnates Aiza during their schedules in late nights (The same scene where Pip accidentally impregnates the woman he did not met while in a drunken state and had a daughter named Monay) and both were comically shocked that they will became as upcoming grandparents on Aiza's unborn child making themselves as both father and mother in-law to both Aiza and Pip.

==Release==

===Box office===
The film captured the number one spot on the first day of [[2011 Metro Manila Film Festival]] box office race with a whooping ₱38.5 million gross well ahead of the runners-up, [[Ang Panday 2]], and [[Segunda Mano]] with ₱20 million and ₱18.25 million gross respectively.&lt;ref name=rodmagaru&gt;http://rodmagaru.com/2011/12/26/2011-mmff-box-office-results/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="pinoy showbiz surfer"&gt;http://pinoybizsurfer.blogspot.com/2011/12/enteng-ng-ina-mo-leads-first-day-of.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
During its opening day, the film grossed over ₱38.5 million nationwide making it as the highest-grossing film on its first day of all-time in the Philippines breaking the records of Spiderman and Avatar. On its 2nd Day, the movie total gross is ₱69 million. It is higher than [[Ang Panday 2]], with ₱38 million and [[Segunda Mano]] with ₱35 million. On its third day, (according to MMFF committee) ''Enteng ng Ina Mo'' grossed 91.9 million. Enteng ng Ina Mo breaks the 4 Day Record of ''[[The Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin]]''(₱109 million) with a record of ₱110 Million. After 4 weeks of showing, the film grossed P 237 million and became the [[List of highest-grossing films in the Philippines|third highest-grossing Filipino film of all time]] and [[List of highest-grossing films in the Philippines|highest-grossing MMFF film of all time]].

===Reception===
The film was graded "B" by the Cinema Evaluation Board of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=760908&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=96 2 MMFF Filmd graded "A" by CEB] via [[Philippine Star]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonio Siegfrid O. Alegado of Business World described that the film could have been better had it not been hampered by poor editing as it was clear that the fusion of the families of Enteng and Ina was done in rather sloppy fashion. The film, however, was saved by the Tanging Ina cast thanks to nice performances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Arts&amp;Leisure&amp;title=Metro-Manila-Film-Festival-2011:-Getting-exactly-what-you-expect&amp;id=44067&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Angelo Ching of PEP.ph gave the film a stronger review and described it as "the perfect mix of humor and fantasy that MMFF moviegoers look for year after year." The review also noted the solid performances of Gwen Zamora, Xyriel Manabat, and Thou Reyes.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.pep.ph/mmff2011/?p=334&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the film's concept of doing a cinematic crossover of two established characters, Philbert Ortiz Dy stated that "filmmakers were content to just have the two big stars together on screen, giving them dialogue from other movies and pushing towards some ridiculous adventure climax".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clickthecity.com/movies/?p=13559&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
* The Kabisote family recognized Ina as the former president. They are referring to the movie, ''[[Ang Tanging Ina N'yong Lahat]]'', when Ina became the president.
* This is also the [[Vic Sotto]]'s second project under [[Star Cinema]] in 2011 after [[Pak! Pak! My Dr. Kwak!]]
* Also the reunion of [[Ai Ai delas Alas|Ai-Ai delas Alas]] and [[Vic Sotto]] after successful of the movie of Bakit ba ganyan? (Ewan ko nga ba, Darling)(2000)
*The last scene where Pip accidentally impregnates Aiza to the horrible surprise of both Enteng and Ina is a reference of how Pip had a daughter named Monay  in the third and final film of ''[[Ang Tanging Ina Mo (Last na 'To!)]]'' where he accidentally impregnates the woman he had never met during their drunken state.

==History==
Extreme Music was founded in London by Russell Emanuel and [[Dolphin Taylor|Dolph Taylor]] in 1997.  Emanuel had played bass with a punk band, Class Ties, and worked a day job as a studio assistant at [[Universal Music Publishing Group|MCA Music Publishing]] and [[Abbey Road Studios]].  After leaving MCA, Emanuel worked at Bruton, a production music library which produced sound-alike music that was recorded, produced, and licensed inexpensively.  He recorded one sound-alike album for Bruton, and financed his band’s touring  through the royalties the album generated.&lt;ref name="billboard taking it to" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SOS" /&gt;

Emanuel also managed bands, including [[Stiff Little Fingers]]. After beginning a job at a third production library, MatchMusic, Emanuel and Stiff Little Fingers drummer Dolph Taylor began to compose music for MatchMusic together. They built a MIDI suite, and when not on tour, they recorded original tracks that reflected their own musical sensibilities. "We were forever knocking our heads against old-school attitudes and being told that 'This is what the marketplace likes.' But we were seeing a new generation of editors coming into the industry and going to clubs and hearing all these thumping records, and they wanted to know why production music didn't sound like that," Taylor said in a 2003 interview. Taylor and Emanuel decided to approach commercial artists, some of whom they already knew, and ask them to record production music tracks.&lt;ref name="SOS" /&gt;

With a $100,000 investment from angel investor Mark Levinson, Extreme Music was founded in 1997. The company was positioned to reflect the
punk rock ethos of its founders; for example, they mailed condoms to 1000 music industry executives with packaging that read "Extreme Music: The Only Safe Thing You'll Ever Get From Us."  With a focus on production, they "upped the industry ante by using professional recording studios and top-notch musicians."  By keeping the library's emphasis on quality over quantity, they streamlined the process of selecting music for advertising agencies and music supervisors.&lt;ref name="billboard taking it to" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SOS"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inglis |first1=Sam |title=Russell Emanuel &amp; Dolph Taylor Of Extreme Music |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun03/articles/extrememusic.asp |accessdate=18 July 2016 |work=Sound on Sound |date=June 1, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606073149/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun03/articles/extrememusic.asp |archivedate=June 6, 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005, Extreme Music had built one of the most profitable production music libraries in the UK. In August 2005 it was bought by [[Viacom]] for $45.1 million, and in 2008 it was acquired by Sony/ATV Music Publishing. The terms of the sale were not disclosed.&lt;ref name="billboard taking it to" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Butler|first1=Susan|title=Famous Price Could Hit Half a Billion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WCkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Viacom+extreme+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O9TAo1aKeA&amp;sig=gLc6-U-Jp2rm6Zq78H5UFLj6HxU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4isWEy9zNAhUGwGMKHWcGB8k4ChDoAQgrMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Viacom%20extreme%20music&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 July 2016|work=Billboard|date=April 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mair|first1=Bob|title=Music Libraries: From Last Resort to Power Players|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=8075|accessdate=5 July 2016|work=Film Music Magazine|date=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=BMN staff|title=Technology &amp; facilities - EXTREME MUSIC VENTURE.|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/technology-and-facilities-extreme-music-venture/1143918.article|accessdate=5 July 2016|work=Broadcast Music Now (subscription required)|date=May 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Extreme introduced Customix, the first web application created specifically for music supervisors to quickly customize songs from its library. It offered complete control to users, allowing the manipulation of individual stems of a track, including the ability to adjust the volume of or mute individual elements, modify tempo without changing pitch, and edit the length of a song without first cutting it into segments. The Customix software was developed in conjunction with Menlo Park technology company UJAM.&lt;ref name="Fast Company" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mashable"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berkman|first1=Fran|title=New Web App Customizes Music for TV and Movies|url=http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/customix/#hBKMKvD9sOqP|accessdate=5 July 2016|work=Mashable|date=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jarvey|first1=Natalie|title=Extreme Music Launches Music Editing Tool|url=http://www.labusinessjournal.com/news/2013/jan/23/extreme-music-launches-music-editing-tool/|accessdate=5 July 2016|work=LA Business Journal|date=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme Music tracks have been licensed by editors, music producers and music supervisors at production companies, networks and advertising agencies, including  [[A+E Networks|A+E]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[BBC]], [[HBO]], the [[NFL]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]. Among other productions, music from the Extreme library has been used in ''[[Mad Men]]'', ''[[Ray Donovan]]'', ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'', ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]'', ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' and ''[[It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia]].''&lt;ref name="billboard taking it to" /&gt;&lt;ref name="variety creds"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Christopher|title=Timbaland and Mike "Daddy" Evans make Extreme pact|url=https://variety.com/2011/music/news/timbaland-and-mike-daddy-evans-make-extreme-pact-1118035776/|accessdate=18 July 2016|work=Variety|date=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="extreme imdb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Extreme Music|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2843612/|website=imdb.com|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Extreme partnered with composer Hans Zimmer and his business partner, Steve Kofsky, to found [[Bleeding Fingers Music]]. A joint venture, it creates show-specific libraries and scores for unscripted, reality, documentary and light drama television shows. In 2017, it was ranked as the leading custom music scoring company in the industry.&lt;ref name="VarietyBF"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grieving|first1=Tim|title=Bleeding Fingers Stretches Its Grasp With ‘Planet Earth II’|url=https://variety.com/2016/music/spotlight/bleeding-fingers-planet-earth-ii-1201843|accessdate=21 September 2016|work=Variety|date=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes CEO spearheads" /&gt;&lt;ref name="billboard bleeding"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galo|first1=Phil|title=Sony/ATV's Extreme Music and Hans Zimmer Form Joint Venture: The Bleeding Fingers Custom Music Shop|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/tv-film/5640673/sonyatvs-extreme-music-and-hans-zimmer-form-joint-venture-the|accessdate=5 July 2016|work=Billboard|date=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fennada-Filmi''' was a Finnish film production company which was in operation from 1950 to 1982. It was one of the largest companies in its field in Finland from 1950s to 1970s. [[Mauno Mäkelä]] was the head of the company during its entire run.

== Beginning ==

Fennada-Filmi had its foundation in the company [[Fenno-Filmi]], which was founded in 1942 and produced 15 movies between 1944–1950. When Mauno Mäkelä was named the CEO of the company in 1949, arrangements began to combine productions of Fenno-Filmi and [[Adams Filmi]]. New company Fennada-Filmi went active in the summer of 1950, and only the distributing duties remained for Adams Filmi. Mäkelä continued as the managing director and production manager of the new company.

== 1950–1960 ==
[[File:Fennada-studio-1971.jpg|thumb|right|The Fennada-Filmi studio, a former indoors tennis court, in [[Kulosaari]], [[Helsinki]], taken into film use ca. 1950, photographed here in 1971.]]
The final film for Fenno-Filmi, ''Hallin Janne'' by [[Roland af Hällström]], was finished in the summer of 1950. At the same time, shooting began for Fennada-Filmi's first production ''Ratavartijan kaunis Inkeri'', directed by [[Hannu Leminen]]. In 1952, [[Lasse Pöysti]] joined the company as a director, and made a total of eight films during the next years. Director [[Ville Salminen]] switched from [[Suomen Filmiteollisuus]] to Fennada-Filmi in 1953, and the next year [[Aarne Tarkas]] joined in as well.

In 1955, Hällström directed Fennada-Filmi's first commercial success, ''Ryysyrannan Jooseppi'' which received three [[Jussi Award]]s. When Hällström died the next year, Mauno Mäkelä hired [[Matti Kassila]] as his replacement. Kassila's first Fennada-Filmi production was ''[[The Harvest Month|Elokuu]]'' (1956). Although the film received critical acclaim and won six Jussi Awards, it was not a commercial success. However, Kassila's next two films, ''Kuriton sukupolvi'' (1957) and ''Syntipukki'' (1957) – both remakes of the 1930s Finnish films – did well at the box office.

== 1960–1982 ==

Since the beginning, Fennada-Filmi had suffered from lack of new ideas and resorted to remakes, while also keeping up the fast production pace. In 1961, two successful films premiered, [[Ritva Arvelo]]'s ''Kultainen vasikka'' and Matti Kassila's ''[[Kaasua, komisario Palmu!]]'', which was a sequel to Kassila's ''[[Komisario Palmun erehdys]]'' (1960). That film had been produced by Suomen Filmiteollisuus, but Mauno Mäkelä managed to get the rights to the sequel.

[[Robert Balser]], an American animator, established Fennada-Filmi's animation department.&lt;ref name=awn2&gt;{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Wolfe|title=Bob Balser Memorial to be Held January 16 |url=http://www.awn.com/news/bob-balser-memorial-be-held-january-16  |work=[[Animation World Network]] |date=13 January 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fate of Fennada-Filmi was at stake with the actors' strike in 1963, and a plan was made to sell the company to the [[Finnish Broadcasting Company]]. This, however, proved to be a very controversial move, and the deal was cancelled. Throughout the mid-1960s, new films went into production only infrequently.

In the fall of 1966, shooting began for a film adaptation of a [[Väinö Linna]]'s ''[[Here, Beneath the North Star|Täällä Pohjantähden alla]]''. Directed by [[Edvin Laine]], the film premiered in the fall of 1968 and was a commercial success. The sequel ''[[Akseli and Elina]]'' also did well when it was released in 1970. Only five more films were released by Fennada-Filmi, with Laine's ''Ruskan jälkeen'' (1979) being the final one. In 1982, the Finnish Broadcasting Company bought the company, which marked the end of its run.

'''Georg Kreisler''' (18 July 1922 – 22 November 2011) was an Austrian–American [[Viennese German|Viennese-language]] [[cabaret]]tist, satirist, composer, and author. He was particularly popular in the 1950s and 1960s. From 2007 he lived in [[Salzburg]], Austria, with his fourth wife, {{ill|Barbara Peters (actress)|de|Barbara Peters (Schauspielerin)|lt=Barbara Peters}}. He died there on 22 November 2011 "after a severe infection," according to his wife Barbara.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abendblatt.de/kultur-live/article2102494/Schriftsteller-Georg-Kreisler-im-Alter-von-89-Jahren-gestorben.html Schriftsteller Georg Kreisler im Alter von 89 Jahren gestorben] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120717063941/http://www.abendblatt.de/kultur-live/article2102494/Schriftsteller-Georg-Kreisler-im-Alter-von-89-Jahren-gestorben.html |date=17 July 2012 }}, ''[[Hamburger Abendblatt]]'', 22 November 2011 {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Kreisler went to high school in Vienna, where he studied [[music theory]], and learned to play violin and piano. In 1938, he was forced to flee with his parents due to increasing [[Nazi]] restrictions on [[Jews]]. In 1941, he married Philine Hollaender, daughter of [[Friedrich Hollaender]] and [[Blandine Ebinger]]. In 1943, he became an American citizen. He enlisted in the [[United States Army|Army]], and was stationed in Europe. He wrote songs for soldiers in Britain and France with the help of [[Marcel Prawy]]. After the war, he went to Hollywood and worked on movies with [[Charlie Chaplin]]. He performed at [[nightclub]]s and bars to make ends meet. In 1947, he was rejected by the record companies because his songs were "un-American", especially songs with titles such as "Please Shoot Your Husband". In 1955, he returned to Europe, first to Vienna, then Munich in 1958, Berlin in 1976, Salzburg in 1988, Basel in 1992, and back to Salzburg in 2007. He died at the age of 89 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/1319183531823/1922---2011-Georg-Kreisler-89-jaehrig-gestorben Georg Kreisler 89-jährig gestorben], ''[[Der Standard]]'', 22 November 2011 {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
Kreisler is considered a master of language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Weigel]]: "Die ersten 50 Jahre des Georg Kreisler", afterword to: Georg Kreisler, ''Ich weiß nicht, was soll ich bedeuten'', Artemis Verlag, Zürich/München, 1973 "... Virtuosität im Sprachstil und im Reim"&lt;/ref&gt; His songs are characterized by [[black humour]] and uncompromising criticism of society and politics. This caused him many difficulties and also contributed to appearance prohibitions in radio and television.

Despite producing several hundred original songs&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/georg-kreisler-satirist-and-doyen-of-viennese-cabaret-6277050.html "Georg Kreisler: Satirist and doyen of Viennese cabaret"], obituary by Colin Beaven, ''[[The Independent]]'' (15 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Kreisler may occasionally have used ideas and material from other artists in his work. His song "{{Lang|de|Die Hand}}" shows strong similarities to [[Tom Lehrer]]'s "I Hold Your Hand in Mine", first recorded by Lehrer in 1953 on the album ''[[Songs by Tom Lehrer]]''. Lehrer's recording predates by several years any documented recording or performance of that song by Kreisler as well as Kreisler's return to performance in German-speaking countries in 1955. Kreisler's "{{Lang|de|Taubenvergiften im Park}}" (first released as "{{Lang|de|Frühlingslied}}")&lt;ref&gt;Album ''Vienna Midnight Cabaret mit Georg Kreisler'', track 1, Amadeo records, Vienna 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; has strong similarities to Lehrer's "[[Poisoning Pigeons in the Park]]". Kreisler and Lehrer each deny copying from the other; so far no one has succeeded in establishing which song was written first. Kreisler's "{{Lang|de|Das Mädchen mit den drei blauen Augen}}" appears to be related to the [[Abe Burrows]] song "The Girl with the Three Blue Eyes" (first recording 1950). Kreisler's song "Bidla Buh" (first recorded in the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golyr.de/georg-kreisler/songtext-a-bidla-buh-466755.html Kreisler lyrics website], accessed 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;) appears to be related to the [[Richard Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart|Hart]] number "[[To Keep My Love Alive]]" composed in 1943.

It carried a wide range of [[anime]], rare, and independent studio films, as well as adult films on its sister site, '''BlueCine'''. It also dedicated 1% of its profits to support independent filmmaking, using the money to both fund and promote independent films that were distributed through the service. It was one of the first video rental services to offer video on demand and fund its own productions, a decade before Netflix and Amazon.

On 2 February 2015, GreenCine's Facebook page carried a message that the business had closed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/GreenCine Facebook&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In December 2008, [[Apple Inc.]] released a series of lists that showed the top downloads of the year from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kumparak|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kumparak|title=Apple announces Top 10 iPhone App downloads of 2008|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=December 2, 2008|url=http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2008/12/02/apple-announces-top-10-iphone-app-downloads-of-2008/|accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lists showed the 10 most-downloaded applications from different categories, in no particular order. The iBeer application from Hottrix appeared in both the "Top Paid Apps (Overall)" and "Top Paid Entertainment" lists.

[[iBeer]] was also called a "must-have" application by [[CNN Money]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kimes|first=Mina|title=Top 10 must-have iPhone apps|publisher=[[CNN Money]]|date=September 23, 2008|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0809/gallery.must_have_iphone_apps.fortune/2.html|accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hottrix was praised by [[Condé Nast Portfolio]] for their trick software, with iBeer singled out as "the perfect gift".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Perfect Gift for The Tech Observer: iBeer!!|publisher=[[Condé Nast Portfolio]]|date=July 12, 2007|url=http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/the-tech-observer/2007/07/12/the-perfect-gift-for-the-tech-observer-ibeer|accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property==
In October 2008, Hottrix filed a [[United states dollar|US$]]12.5 million lawsuit against [[Coors Brewing Company]] for developing an application called ''iPint'' for iOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chen|first=Brian X.|title=Indie iPhone Developer Sues Coors for $12.5M|publisher=[[Wired News]]|date=October 13, 2008|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2008/10/indie-iphone-de/|accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit alleged that Coors violated copyright law by making a program similar to iBeer. Apple removed iPint from the App Store in the United States after receiving a complaint from Hottrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Jim|title=Virtual beer war hits the iPhone|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=October 17, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/low/technology/newsid_7676000/7676081.stm|accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of iOS applications==
{{see also|iOS}}

===App Store apps===
These tricks are available at the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].

====HottrixPhone====
This trick gives the appearance of a phone call with a famous celebrity, including real pre-recorded voices of same. Multiple celebrities are available in the application, including [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Barack Obama]], and the ability for users to add others.

====iBeer====
[[File:Ibeer icon.png|right|75 px]]
''iBeer'' is a trick that gives the illusion that the device screen "fills" with many varieties of [[beer]] (including sound). If the device is tilted, the virtual beer swishes around to give the illusion of truly being filled with beer. The beer can be "drained" if the device is tilted enough, and a belch sounds when the beer has been completely drained.  iBeer appeared in both the "Top Paid Apps (Overall)" and "Top Paid Entertainment" lists published by Apple in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kumparak|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kumparak|title=Apple announces Top 10 iPhone App downloads of 2008|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=December 2, 2008|url=http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2008/12/02/apple-announces-top-10-iphone-app-downloads-of-2008/|accessdate=September 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====iBug====
''iBug'' is a trick that gives the appearance of a virtual insect appearing on the screen of the device. It responds to touch and can get fat. The bug laughs when the device is shaken.

====iMilk====
''iMilk'' is a trick similar to iBeer, but appears as different varieties of [[milk]], such as chocolate milk, strawberry milk, and "martian milk." iMilk has a pay trick and a magic button to perform various tricks with money.

====iMunchies====
''iMunchies'' is a trick that gives the illusion that the device is filling with many varieties of snacks such as [[candy]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], and [[popcorn]]. A person could then pretend to pull snacks out of the device by reaching beneath it and retrieving a previously-hidden snack using [[sleight of hand]]. The snacks can also be poured out of the device.

====iSoda====
''iSoda'' is a trick similar to iBeer and iMilk, but with various [[soft drink]]s, such as cola, energy drink, and fizzy water.

====Jarheads====
''Jarhead Bob'', ''Jarhead Tim'', and ''Jarhead Ned'' are tricks that have dungeon lab samples in potent juice. The heads roll their eyes when the device is tilted and the juice turns into blood when shaken. The liquid drains when the device is tilted enough, similar to iBeer.

====Magic Wallet====
''Magic Wallet'' is a trick similar to iMunchies, but with [[coin]]s in many currencies instead of snacks.

===Premier apps===
These tricks are like App Store apps, but are only available at Hottrix's Premier App Shop.
*''iHypno'', a card trick application, mentioned in the [[Wall Street Journal]] as an example of a legal workaround to the Apple iTunes Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Charny|first=Ben|title=Developers Start To Look For Work-Around To Apple App Store|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=August 13, 2009|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090813-713707.html|accessdate=September 10, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816130703/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090813-713707.html |archivedate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infonet''' was a [[Malaysia]]n [[teletext]] service. It was formerly known as '''''Beriteks''''' (a combination of the Malay word ''Berita'', meaning ''news'', and ''Teks'', which is a borrowed word from the English language meaning ''text''). The [[teletext]] system was launched on 2 June 1985 by [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]]. While [[TV1 (Malaysia)|RTM1]] and [[TV2 (Malaysia)|RTM2]] were still transmitting Teletext, the contents of the transmission were different from those offered by [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]]'s service, which was then also transmitted under the name ''Beriteks''. RTM1 and RTM2 has ceased teletext transmission as of 2000, and TV3 was the only TV station in Malaysia transmitting Teletext. None of TV3's sister companies, [[8TV (Malaysia)|8TV]], [[TV9 (Malaysia)|TV9]] and [[NTV7]], are transmitting teletext.

Infonet ceased operation from 1 January 2008. Therefore, there are now no TV stations transmitting Teletext in Malaysia.

Infonet uses the [[BBC]] [[Ceefax]] teletext system.

'''''Instruction and Advice for the Young Bride''''' purports to be a booklet written by Ruth Smythers in 1894 that states that women find sex displeasurable and discusses methods which a newly married woman may use to discourage her husband from sex. Although there is ample evidence that the text is a joke or hoax - Ruth Smythers, her husband and the institutions mentioned in the pamphlet did not exist (names 'Ruth' and 'Smithers' (sic) appear alongside, albeit separately in a once popular work of fiction by [[John Galsworthy]], a 1910 play [[Justice (play)|''Justice'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2911?msg=welcome_stranger|title=Justice by John Galsworthy|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2017|via=www.gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and some of the language and reference points were not used until the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bookstoysgames.wordpress.com/2007/12/20/the-amazing-mrs-ruth-smythers/|title=The Amazing Mrs. Ruth Smythers|first=|last=Ray|date=20 December 2007|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themediadesk.com/newfiles2/youngbride.htm Origins] @Gonzo Journalism on the NET!&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/weddings/newlywed/advice.asp|title=Advice to Young Brides|date=6 July 2008|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; - it has fooled some people and even a newspaper into believing it is a serious text, partly because some back covers of the book imply that it is genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8QDzUjS8w4C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=%22instruction+and+advice+for+the+young+bride%22+university|title=Perspectives on Human Sexuality|first1=Anne|last1=Bolin|first2=Patricia|last2=Whelehan|date=1 January 1999|publisher=SUNY Press|accessdate=2 May 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/article1833968.ece|title=The Sun, Sex tips for wives in 1894 and today, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text, purportedly published in Spiritual Guidance Press, [[New York City]] and reprinted by The Madison Institute Newsletter, Fall Issue, in 1894, has become a well-known humorous pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sXJWMf77j54C&amp;dq=%22instruction+and+advice+for+the+young+bride%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Drunkcow Landmines, Daryl Meakes, 2004, p. 219] Book overview in google: "Drunkcow landmines are wickedly-unusual-but-oddly-believable stories that have been passed along by someone who believes the story to have happened to a friend of a friend."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humor.beecy.net/menwomen/bride/|title=Instruction and Advice for the Young Bride|website=humor.beecy.net|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M65Rxn5nSDkC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22instruction+and+advice+for+the+young+bride%22&amp;as_brr=3|title=When I Was a Kid, This Was a Free Country|first=G. Gordon|last=Liddy|date=19 September 2003|publisher=Regnery Publishing|accessdate=2 May 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been published in book form as ''Sex Tips for Husbands and Wives from 1894''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sex-Tips-Husbands-Wives-1894/dp/1840247029|title=Sex Tips For Husbands and Wives from 1894|first=Ruth|last=Smythers|date=1 September 2008|publisher=Summersdale|accessdate=2 May 2017|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet origins ==

The text, which has circulated and spread over websites and blogs and has been translated into other languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://missby.wordpress.com/2008/05/30/young-bride/|title=Инструкции и съвети за млади булки|date=30 May 2008|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes sourced to a 1998 course on [[human sexuality]] in the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/psy210/|title=University of Washington course website|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as this was two years after a passage of the book was read out in a legal hearing during the Krull case, this is unlikely.

== Krull case ==
In 1996, the Ombudsman of King County in [[Seattle]], David Krull, was fired for misconduct after he emailed the text of the booklet to his assistant, Amy Calderwood, who was about to get married. Krull had stated that the email was a light hearted joke, but Calderwood claimed it was "inappropriate", her fiancé said it was "vile" and council member Maggi Fimia, who voted for Krull to be fired, called the text "incredibly offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19961015&amp;slug=2354379|title=Local News - Harassment Charge Believed By Expert - Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19961022&amp;slug=2355636 Ombudsman Is Fired -- County Council Says Krull Engaged In `Misconduct'] in Seattle Times October 22, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seattle Times September 4, 1996"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960904&amp;slug=2347403|title=Local News - Accused Of Misconduct, Ombudsman Fights Back -- King County Watchdog Says Sex Complaint Is `Retaliation' - Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19961010&amp;slug=2353526|title=Local News - Council Fires Back At Krull - Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neil Young]] skipped most of the acoustic set (the exceptions being his compositions "Mr. Soul" and "Wonderin'") and joined [[Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (and Young)|Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash]] during the electric set, but refused to be filmed; by his own report, Young felt the filming was distracting both performers and audience from the music. Despite his refusal, footage does exist of him performing "Mr. Soul" and "Long Time Gone." The "Mr. Soul" performance can be found as an Easter Egg on his Archives 1963-1972 DVD box set, however because of his resistance to being filmed during much of the performance the camera remains focused on Stills. Young's "Sea of Madness," heard on the album, was drawn from the Fillmore East concert, one month after the festival.  The original recording was later restored on the six-CD boxed set ''Woodstock: 40 Years On [Back To Yasgur's Farm]''

A '''media feeding frenzy''' is intense media coverage of a story of great interest to the public.

The 1998 [[Lewinsky scandal]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] was a well-noted example of this.

The [[metaphor]], drawing an analogy with [[feeding frenzy|feeding frenzies]] of groups of animals, was popularized by [[Larry Sabato]]'s book ''Feeding Frenzy: Attack Journalism and American Politics''.

Other examples include media coverage of "crime waves" that often drive changes in criminal law to address problems that do not appear in the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS), the most reliable indicator of actual crime in the U.S.;  unlike the [[Uniform Crime Reports]] (UCR), the NCVS is not affected by changes in people's willingness to report crimes to law enforcement and in the willingness of law enforcement to forward UCRs to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) for inclusion in national summaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sacco | first = Vincent F. 
| year = 2005 | title = When Crime Waves | publisher = Sage 
| isbn = 9780761927839}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Sacco claimed that media outlets try to organize their reporting as much as possible around themes to help them amortize over several reports the work required to educate a journalist to the point where s/he can discuss a subject intelligently.  These themes become "feeding frenzies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Of course, a commercial media organization could lose advertising if they had a media feeding frenzy that affected an advertiser's business:  Advertisers don't want to feed mouths that bite them, and have been known to modify where they spend their advertising budget accordingly.  Commercial media disseminate negative information about advertisers only to the extent required to keep customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = McChesney | first = Robert W.

'''''Mirza Sahiba''''' ({{lang-pa|ਮਿਰਜ਼ਾ ਸਾਹਿਬਾਂ}}, {{lang|pa|مرزا صاحباں}}, ''{{IAST|mirzā sāhibāṁ}}'') is one of the three popular tragic romances of [[Punjab]]. The other two are ''[[Heer Ranjha]]'', ''[[Sohni Mahiwal]]'' . There are six other popular folklore stories in Punjab: ''[[Momal Rano]]'', [[Sassui Punnhun|Sassi Punhoon]], ''[[Umar Marvi]]'', ''[[LiLa Chanesar]]'', ''[[Noori Jam Tamachi]]'' and ''[[Dhaj, Ror Kumar]]''. These nine tragic romances are popular in Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punjabiworld.com/Creative-Punjab/Legends-of-Punjab/love-legends-of-punjab.html|title=Love Legends In History of Punjab|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These six and ''[[Sorath Rai Diyach]]'' are originally from [[Sindh]], and along with ''Sohni Mahiwal'' and ''Sassi Punnun'' are commonly known as Seven Queens ({{lang-sd|ست صورميون}}) of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesindhuworld.com/lila_chanesar.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721224737/http://www.thesindhuworld.com/lila_chanesar.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are culturally included in both [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] and [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] traditions.

''Mirza Sahiba'' was first written by the Punjabi sofi poet Hafiz Barkhudar Ranjha from Tahat Hazara District Sargodha Pakistan. Hafiz Barkhudar was student of a Hakeem family, ancestors of Punjab and do Bait under Hakeem family ancestors. That Hakeem family brought Hafiz Sahab from Tahat Hazara district Sargodha to a place in Sialkot Pakistan named Chitti Sheikhan. Hafiz Sahab lived and died in Chitti Sheikhan.

Mirza Khan was the son of Wanjhal Khan, the leader of the Kharal jat/Rajput Tribe origin in Danabad, a town in the [[Jaranwala]] area of [[Faisalabad]], [[Pakistan]]. Sahiba was the daughter of Mahni, the chief of Khewa, a town in Sial Territory in the [[Jhang]] district, Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Mirza_Sahiban|title=Mirza Sahiban - SikhiWiki, free Sikh encyclopedia.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A long time ago in the village of Kheewa, a town in the control of Sial tribe of [[Jat people|Jats]], a woman gave birth to a baby boy. Unfortunately, the woman died after giving birth and was unable to breastfeed her son. However, another woman nearby had recently given birth to a girl. This woman took it upon herself to help the little boy. She fed this boy as she did her own daughter.

Thus, as is the custom for such occasions, these two children became “milk siblings” because they were given the same milk to drink. Later as the children became adults, the girl, named Fateh Bibi, got married and moved a day’s journey on horseback away to the village of Danababad near present-day Faisalabad. Fateh Bibi married a man named Wanjal, the Sardar of the Kharrals, and they had a strong son named Mirza.

Meanwhile, Fateh Bibi’s milk brother, no longer a boy but a man named Khewa Khan, Sardar of the Sial Jats, had a daughter named Sahiba.

When it was time to enroll the children in school, Mirza’s parents had decided to send him to his “milk uncle’s” house so he could get educated there. Sahiba’s father enrolled her and her “cousin” into classes to learn the Quran together since they were of the same age. 

Mirza did not know that his “cousin” Sahiba was such a beauty one can only dream of beholding. He did not notice her at first when he came to Kheewa to study because they were just children. As the two children grew into adolescence, feelings of love began to blossom between the two. 

One day the adventurous young Mirza took a different path home while walking back from school. There was a bazaar on that street. He saw Sahiba buying some vegetables for her family. He watched as she asked for various squashes and leaves to cook. When the merchant began to weigh her purchases, he weighed out extra because he was lost in her beauty. Mirza, too, was transfixed by her gracefulness and raced all the way home fueled by love.

Mirza became skilled as a horseman and archer as he grew older. He rode on a powerful steed named Bakki who swiftly maneuvered through the land. Mirza was so skillful that every arrow he shot would willfully go exactly where he wanted. Sahiba only grew more and more beautiful with time.

Soon, their love began to blossom. Mirza could not live without his Sahiba. They were lost in their own world. Once, when Sahiba had pronounced her lessons incorrectly, her maulvi beat her with a chimmak.  This thin branch gives a person a burning sting when swatted with it. As Sahiba received her punishment with the chimmak, she spoke to the maulvi. 

Sadly, their days of blissful love did not last. Sahiba’s parents found out about the love affair and sent Mirza back home to his parents. Not too long after that, they arranged Sahiba’s marriage to a man named Tahir Khan. He was from the same town. With Mirza back home, Sahiba’s parents were able to prepare for the wedding without any interruptions. 

Sahiba, via her friend, a Brahmin named Karmu, sent word of her unfortunate marriage to her darling Mirza.  As soon as he heard of this, he made plans to leave.  His family tried to stop him but he would not succumb to their pleas.  He had to go.  Before Mirza left, his father, seeing that there was no other way, went to Mirza and told him that if he went, then he must be sure to return with Sahiba or else it would bring great dishonor. With those words, Wanjal gave his son his blessings to pursue his love.
“Chal, my Bakki,” Mirza, equipped with his bow and arrows, commanded his horse to ride on to the village of Kheewa.

Mirza reached Sahiba on the day of the wedding right before the ceremony was about to proceed. He opened the door to the room Sahiba was waiting in and entered secretly. He admired her; she was dressed in bright red wedding clothes, her delicate hands darkly painted with mehndi. Without waiting another moment, he held her hand and took her away with him on horseback and rode until he thought that they had reached a safe distance.  Tired, he decided to rest by under the shade of a tree while his sweet Sahiba watched over him.

Meanwhile, back at the wedding party, Sahiba brothers called for her to come down to proceed with the ceremonies. When she did not come, her brothers realized that something was wrong. Sahiba’s brothers, the jilted bridegroom, and other male cousins rode on horseback in search for Mirza and Sahiba.

Sahiba, while keeping watch over her slumbering beloved, feared that her brothers would soon catch up. She did not know what to do. If her brothers came and Mirza woke up then her brothers would surely die at the hands of Mirza’s quick arrows.

With the hope of her brothers taking pity on her, Sahiba reached Mirza’s quiver and broke each sharp arrow it contained in half.  She believed that no blood would be spilled this way. Suddenly, Sahiba’s brothers and relatives found the couple under the tree. With one quick shot from Sahiba’s brother’s bow, Mirza awoke to an arrow piercing his throat. Mirza reached for his arrow and saw all the broken pieces. He looked up at Sahiba, searching for an answer in her face but was struck with yet another arrow, this time in the chest. Sahiba threw herself over him and together, they died.

==In popular culture==
The tale of Mirza Sahiban is part of popular [[Punjabi culture]]. There are many folk song versions, including the hit version titled "Mirza" sung by the legendary [[Alam Lohar]]. He was the first main Punjabi singer to bring this story to a song format and had a distinct way of singing it, with extreme vocal strength with Algoza (Jhori) and Chimta in 1941. Since then many other Punjabi singers have followed his style, including [[Noor Jehan]] for the film ''Mirza Jat'', released in 1982.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

There have been various film interpretations of the folk tale.
* ''Mirza Jat'' (1982) is a Pakistani Punjabi film starring [[Shahid (actor)|Shahid Hameed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318449/reference|title=Mirza Jat (1982)|work=[[IMDB]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Hero Hitler in Love]]'' (2011), an Indian Punjabi film starring [[Babbu Maan]] and [[Mouni Roy]], creates a modern Mirza and Sahiban story with a twist.
* ''[[Mirza – The Untold Story]]'' (2012), an Indian Punjabi film, is a modern rendition of Mirza and Sahiban Story, with the title song sung by Arif Lohar, son of (late) Alam Lohar.
* ''[[Mirzya (film)|Mirzya]]'' (2016), an Indian Hindi film directed by [[Rakesh Omprakash Mehra]], is based on Mirza and Sahiban and closely follows the original story. [[Harshvardhan Kapoor]] plays Mirza and [[Saiyami Kher]] plays Sahiba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/WATCH-Harshvardhan-Kapoors-Mirziya-logo-trailer-unveiled/articleshow/50204809.cms?|title=WATCH: Harshvardhan Kapoor's 'Mirziya' logo trailer unveiled!|date=16 Dec 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Mirza Juuliet]]'' (2017), an Indian Hindi film, is a modern retelling of the original story. It is set in [[Uttar Pradesh]], showing the nexus between politicians and criminals.

==History==
[[File:Newman Day.png|thumb|444x444px|The hours between drinks significantly diminish a participant's [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC). However, consuming 288 oz (0.3 liters) of alcohol within 24 hours gives participants a BAC of [[Short-term effects of alcohol consumption|0.300–0.399]].]]
The first reference to "Paul Newman Day" occurred in the late 1970s in ''[[The Bates Student]].''&lt;ref name="dailyprincetonian.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":032" /&gt; It was noted as a day where students participated in [[food fight]]s in the dining hall while drinking.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; However, the activity was renamed "Newman Day" and included following a rhetorical and hypothetical pseudo-mandate made by Newman. In a speech to college students that was profiled by a magazine, Newman stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;Twenty four hours in a day, [[Beer in the United States|twenty four beers in a case]]. Coincidence? I think not.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brokeandthirsty.com/2014/04/24/happy-newmans-day-or-the-perfect-excuse-to-drink-24-beers-in-24-hours/|title=Happy Newman's Day!

=== Rules ===
Newman Day begins at 12:00 am on the morning of April 24th and concludes at 11:59 pm.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; The traditional and original rules stipulate that one beer must be consumed every hour, on the hour, during this time period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this time, the participant is allowed to sleep but is not allowed to "[[Alcoholism|boot]]" (throw up), or else the amount of beer consumed is "reset" to zero and they must begin the challenge again (i.e. if someone were to throw up at 11:50 pm, ''should they choose to complete the activity'', they would have to consume 24 beers in nine minutes or 540 seconds).&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; The participant must continue with their daily activities (i.e. going to classes, sports practices, theatre performances, etc.), assuming a normal outer appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://affotd.com/2011/04/24/newmans-da/|title=Newman’s Day, Why Beer Comes in Cases|date=2011-04-24|website=America Fun Fact of the Day|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not specified, when Newman stated "[[Beer in the United States|24 beers in a case]]", many students at Bates College interpreted that to mean the standard [[fluid ounce]] of a [[Beverage can|beer can]], i.e. 12 ounces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Health impact ===
{{Further|Blood alcohol content#Effects by blood alcohol content}}
The consumption of 24 beers in 24 hours can have serious negative effects on a kidney's processing capabilities and induce cognitive irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3943137/what-drinking-does-to-your-body-over-time/|title=What Drinking Does to Your Body Over Time|last=Sifferlin|first=Alexandra|date=July 1, 2015|website=Time|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of [[Human body weight|body weight]] or time in between drinks, the total consumption of a 12 ounce beer, every hour on the hour, can have universal effects on the mental state and physical composition of participants.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csbsju.edu/chp/health-promotion/alcohol-guide/understanding-blood-alcohol-content-(bac)|title=Understanding Blood Alcohol Content (BAC): – CSB/SJU|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csbsju.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to standardized [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC) levels and the impact of [[sleep deprivation]], a typical Newman Day follows as:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* 12:00 AM – 5:00 AM: participants should feel mild [[euphoria]], talkativeness, and impaired concentration. Resetting (and then completing) Newman Days after 5:00 AM can lead to an overloaded BAC possibly causing severe [[central nervous system depression]], an [[Coma|induced coma]], or even death.
* 5:00 AM – 10:00 AM: participants should feel boisterousness, [[Nausea|nauseous]], and should experience slurred speech.
* 10:00 AM – 5:00 PM: participants should experience [[Borderline personality disorder|emotional swings]], severe motor impairment, and a temporary loss of memory.
* 5:00 PM – 10:00 PM: participants should experience lapses in and out of consciousness, loss of basic understanding, and difficulty speaking.
* 10:00 PM – 11:59 PM: participants should experience irregular heartbeats, blackouts, and [[Alcohol intoxication|alcohol poisoning]].

The negative health impacts of Newman Day can be mitigated by sleeping a full eight to ten hours the day before, eating regularly throughout Newman Day, drinking water intermittently, and not resetting the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm|title=CDC - Fact Sheets-Binge Drinking - Alcohol|last=|first=|date=May 10, 2015|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newman's public disapproval ===
Newman strongly opposed the tradition as he himself struggled with drinking. He called it "abhorrent" and "cruel."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; While Bates College and Princeton University began to establish the tradition on their campuses, Newman wrote letters to the universities' presidents denouncing the activities around the tradition. In April 2004, he took out a page in ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'', Princeton's college newspaper, to say that the quote was misattributed and to register his disapproval.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; During an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', he stated that students at participating universities were free to do what they please, but they shouldn't use his name.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He encouraged students to participate in "twenty-three hours of community service followed by a cold one."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;
[[File:Paul Newman in Venice, 1963.jpg|thumb|Newman disapproved of the tradition; he urged students to participate in "twenty-three hours of community service followed by a [[Beer|cold one]]."]]
He sent a letter to the President of Bates College, [[Thomas Hedley Reynolds|Thomas Reynolds]] on April 20, 1987, in which he said:&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Mr. Reynolds:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I was surprised to learn that a day which was held in my honor was actually an excuse for drunkenness, disregard for property, disrespect for people, and deeds of questionable character. That the tradition of these activities has been wisely quashed by those in authority is indeed a relief.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like to propose that Paul Newman Day be reinstated under somewhat different guidelines; i.e., a day in pursuit of athletic excellence with paid attendance. The proceeds to be returned to the community in ways of your own choosing. I would be grateful to learn if the students find any merit in this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Sincerely, [[Paul Newman]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;P.S. My office address is: [[520 Park Avenue|500 Park Avenue]], [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|NY]] 10022&lt;/blockquote&gt;Bates along with Princeton quickly disavowed any responsibility for the event, responding that Newman Day is not sponsored, endorsed, or encouraged by the universities and is solely an unofficial event among students.

'''Political theatre''' is  [[theatre]] that comments on political and social issues.

==History==
In the history of theatre, there is long tradition of performances addressing issues of current events, especially those central to society itself. The [[political satire]] performed by the [[comic poets]] at the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theatres]] had considerable influence on [[public opinion]] in the [[Athenian democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. (1993) ''Comic Hero versus Political Elite'' pp.307-19 in {{cite book |editor=Sommerstein, A.H. |editor2=S. Halliwell |editor3=J. Henderson |editor4=B. Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those earlier Western dramas, arising out of the [[polis]], or democratic [[city-state]] of Greek society, were performed in amphitheaters, central arenas used for theatrical performances, religious ceremonies and political gatherings; these dramas had a ritualistic and social significance that enhanced the relevance of the political issues being examined.

[[Shakespeare]] is an author of political theatre according to some academic scholars, who observe that his history plays examine the machinations of personal drives and passions determining political activity and that many of the tragedies such as ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''[[Macbeth]]'' dramatize political leadership and complexity subterfuges of human beings driven by the lust for power. For example, they observe that [[class struggle]] in the [[Roman Republic]] is central to ''[[Coriolanus]]''.&lt;ref name=DollimoreSinfieldDrakakis&gt;[[Jonathan Dollimore]] and [[Alan Sinfield]], eds. ''Political Shakespeare: Essays in [[Cultural materialism (cultural studies)|Cultural Materialism]]'' (Manchester, Eng.: Manchester UP, 1985), {{ISBN|0-7190-4352-2}}; John Drakakis, ed. ''Alternative Shakespeares'', New Accents Ser. (New York and London: Routledge, 1985), {{ISBN|0-415-02528-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically in [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]], the term political theatre was sometimes referred to as '''agitprop theatre''' or simply '''agitprop''', after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] term [[agitprop]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/agitprop&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent political drama==

&lt;!--what are the sources of the following paragraphs?--&gt;
In later centuries, political theatre has sometimes taken a different form. Sometimes associated with [[cabaret]] and folk theatre, it has offered itself as a theatre 'of, by, and for the people'.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In this guise, political theatre has developed within the civil societies under oppressive governments as a means of actual underground communication and the spreading of critical thought.

Often political theatre has been used to promote specific political theories or ideals, for example in the way agitprop theatre has been used to further [[Marxism]] and the development of [[communist]] sympathies.  Russian agitprop theater was noted for its cardboard characters of perfect virtue and complete evil, and its coarse ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]], ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime'', p303, {{ISBN|978-0-394-50242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Marxist theatre wasn't always this directly agitational.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[Bertolt Brecht]] developed a highly elaborate and sophisticated new [[aesthetics]]--[[epic theater]]—to address the spectator in a more rational way.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Brecht's aesthetics have influenced political playwrights throughout the world, especially in India and Africa.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[Augusto Boal]] developed the [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] form of ''Lehrstücke'' into  his internationally acclaimed ''Theatre of the Oppressed'', with its techniques of 'forum theatre' and 'invisible theatre', to further social change.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Boal's work in this area has contributed to the emergence of the [[Theatre for development|Theatre for Development]] movement across the world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In the sixties playwrights like [[Peter Weiss]] adopted a more 'documentary' approach towards political theatre, following on from the example of [[Erwin Piscator]] in the twenties. Weiss wrote plays closely based on historical documents like the proceedings of the Auschwitz trial in Frankfurt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Less radical versions of political theatre have become established within the mainstream modern repertory - such as the realist dramas of [[Arthur Miller]] (''[[The Crucible]]'' and ''[[All My Sons]]''), which probe the behavior of human beings as social and political animals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A new form of political theatre emerged in the twentieth century with [[feminism|feminist]] authors like [[Elfriede Jelinek]] or [[Caryl Churchill]], who often make use of the non-realistic techniques detailed above.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. During the 1960s and 1970s, new theatres emerged addressing women's issues. These theatres went beyond producing feminist plays, but also sought to give women opportunities and work experience in all areas of theatrical production which had heretofore been dominated by men. In addition to playwright, producers, and actors, there were opportunities for women electricians, set designers, musical director, stage managers, etc.

[[The Living Theatre]], created by [[Judith Malina]] and her husband [[Julian Beck]] in 1947, which had its heyday in the 1960s, during the [[Vietnam War]], is a primary example of politically oriented Brechtian performance art in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Their original productions of [[Kenneth Brown (playwright)|Kenneth Brown]]'s ''[[The Brig (play)|The Brig]]'' (c. 1964), also filmed, and of [[Jack Gelber]]'s controversial play ''[[The Connection (1959 play)|The Connection]]'' and its 1961 [[The Connection (1961 film)|film]] rely upon and illustrate the [[dramaturgy]] of Brechtian [[alienation effect]] (''Verfremdungseffekt'') that most political theatre uses to some extent, forcing the audience to take a "critical perspective" on events being dramatized or projected on screen(s) and building on aspects of the [[Theatre of Cruelty]], which developed from the theory and practice of French early [[surrealist]] and proto-[[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] [[Antonin Artaud]].&lt;ref name=LivTh&gt;The Living Theatre is currently still functioning and has produced a new production of ''[[The Brig (play)|The Brig]]''; see its website: [http://www.livingtheatre.org/ The Living Theatre]. Retrieved 18 Sept. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In American regional theatre, a politically oriented social orientation occurs in [[Street theatre]], such as that produced by the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]] and ROiL.  The [[Detroit Repertory Theatre]] has been among those regional theaters at the forefront of political comedy, staging plays like [[Jacob M. Appel]]'s [[Arborophilia]], in which a lifelong Democrat prefers that her daughter fall in love with a poplar tree instead of a Republican activist.&lt;ref&gt;"Daughters in Love Fuel Mom's Dismay," ''Detroit Free Press'', November 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Chicago's [[Annoyance Theater]] produced [[Good Morning Gitmo]]: a one-act play by [[Mishu Hilmy]] and Eric Simon which lampoons the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|US Detention Center at Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref name="Hayford"&gt;Hayford, Justin [http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/good-morning-gitmo/Event?oid=15029124 Review: ''Good Morning Gitmo'']. [[Chicago Reader]]. Retrieved on November 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]], founder of the Scottish popular theatre company [[7:84]], argued that "the theatre can never 'cause' a social change. It can articulate pressure towards one, help people celebrate their strengths and maybe build their self-confidence… Above all, it can be the way people find their voice, their solidarity and their collective determination."&lt;ref name="McGrath"&gt;[[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]], ''A Good Night Out, Popular Theatre: Audience, Class, Form'' (London: Nick Hern Books, 1991), {{ISBN|1-85459-370-6}}; ''The Bone Won't Break: On Theatre and Hope in Hard Times'' (London: Methuen, 1990), {{ISBN|0-413-63260-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Iraq War]] is the focus of some recent British political drama; for example, ''[[Stuff Happens]]'', by [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]].  [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] and [[Mark Ravenhill]] also satirize contemporary socio-political realities in their recent dramatic works.

[[Banner Theatre]] in [[Birmingham]], England, in the [[United Kingdom]], is an example of a specific kind of political theatre called [[Documentary theatre]].

'''Richard Ward "Dick" Pelham''' (February 13, 1815 – October 1876), born '''Richard Ward Pell''', was an American [[blackface]] performer. He was born in New York City.

Pelham regularly did blackface acts in the early 1840s both solo and as part of a duo or trio. His early performances were in the mould of [[Thomas D. Rice]]; he did song-and-dance versions of "[[Gumbo Chaff]]" and "[[Oh Pshaw!]]", among others. His brother, [[Gilbert Pelham]], paired with him for part of his early career. The song "[[Massa Is a Stingy Man]]" became their trademark tune. Pelham was also a renowned dancer; by 1845, he was ranked so highly that [[William Henry Lane]] did an impression of him.

In 1843, Pelham became one of the founding members of the [[Virginia Minstrels]], the first group to present a full [[minstrel show]] during a performance at the New York [[Bowery Amphitheatre]] on February 6, 1843. Through April 1843, he played [[tambourine]] as the Virginia Minstrels toured New York City and Boston. Pelham's style was something new for the time; in addition to traditional techniques, he played it like a drum.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Pelham and [[Frank Brower]], who played the [[bones (instrument)|bones]], were the first minstrel endmen, and greatly influenced the stereotype. Pelham's stage demeanor involved "looks and movements comic beyond conception. He seemed animated by a savage energy; and [the handling of his instrument] . . . nearly wrung him off his seat. His white eyes rolled in a curious frenzy . . . and his hiccupping chuckles were unsurpassable."&lt;ref&gt;1846 review in England, printed in a pamphlet on the [[Ethiopian Serenaders]]. Pelham was playing bones in this concert. Quoted in Nathan 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Pelham's signature non-musical bit was his "A Brief Battering at the Blues", a comic monologue and prototypical [[stump speech (minstrelsy)|stump speech]].

On April 21, 1843, when the group broke up. Pelham decided to settle in England. He briefly helped reform the Virginia Minstrels in the spring of 1844 when he met up with Brower and [[Joel Sweeney]] in Liverpool. The trio convinced [[Dan Emmett]] to rejoin, and the new ensemble played the [[Theatre Royal, Dublin]], from April 24 to May 7 . They toured through June, then broke up again.

Over the next few decades, Pelham continued to perform, only now with British minstrel troupes. [[Pablo Fanque]], one of Victorian England's most celebrated circus proprietors (later immortalized in [[The Beatles]] song "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"), helped popularize a Pelham sketch in England through performances at his circus in the 1860s.  One of the most popular routines at Pablo's  circus at [[Bolton]] in 1868 was Pelham's "Wha's Your Ticket?" in which an actor portrays "the character of a Negro engaged to collect tickets at a bal masque with express instructions to allow no one to pass without, but who by his blundering allows all to enter without that requisite."  The  sketch was described in 1859 as a "new afterpiece expressly imported from [[New Orleans]] by permission of R.W. Pelham Esq."  The sketch was still being performed in England as a "laughable American sketch" as late as 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Holrook Gerzina, Editor, "Black Victorians-Black Victoriana" (Rutgers University Press: New Brunswick, NJ, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The huge success of a recent British tour by the African-American [[Master Juba]] may have adversely affected Pelham's career there as his performance suffered in comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Pelham felt obliged to place a notice in ''The Times'' rebutting an unfavourable review in the ''Sunday Times'' the day before, from which he quotes, adversely comparing him with Juba: "Marylebone - Novelty and variety have certainly not been among the desiderata at this theatre of late, for no sooner are the talents of 'that eminent American tragedian' Mr. Buchanan withdrawn from these boards than that 'incomparable American wonder' Mr. R.W. Pelham appears thereon. He is described in the bills as 'the only true delineator of the slaves and free blacks that has ever appeared at any theatre in Europe or America' - pretty bold assertion this - and he has been playing the character of  Sambo Hit-'em-Hard every night of the past week in a piece we believe, of his own compilation...we must observe that Mr. Pelham's entertainment and Mr. Pelham's acting were dry, tame and ineffective.  His "cotton picking reel," as it was termed, was a very wretched imitation of Juba's style of dancing...". In his reply Pelham states that he "can prove by the American press the fact of his having danced before the public in his own style years before Juba was heard of." ''The Times'', Monday, Oct 25, 1852; pg. 4; Issue 21255; col A&lt;/ref&gt; His final performance was on August 19, 1856. Richard Pelham eventually married an English actress. He died in or near Liverpool&lt;ref&gt;Births, Marriages and Deaths (United Kingdom) Oct-Dec 1876: PELHAM, Richard Ward...60...Liverpool: ref 8b. 97&lt;/ref&gt; in October 1876.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3868">'''Ruth Berlau''' (24 August 1906, [[Charlottenlund]] – 15 January 1974 in [[East Berlin]]) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] actress, director, photographer and writer, known for her collaboration with [[Bertolt Brecht]] and for founding the [[Bertolt-Brecht-Archiv]] in Berlin.  [[File:Tombstone Ruth Berlau.jpg|thumb|135px|Headstone in the [[Dorotheenstädtischer Friedhof]] [[list of cemeteries in Berlin|Berlin]]]]

Born to a merchant family, she learned French at a convent school, but had to drop out due to a pregnancy at the age of thirteen. She studied acting and established her Danish reputation playing Anna in Brecht's ''[[Drums in the Night]]''. During her teenage years, she financed a bicycle tour of France, by writing up a somewhat fictionalized account of her travels for a Danish newspaper. In 1930, she toured the [[Soviet Union]] by bicycle, and on her return joined the [[Communist Party of Denmark|communist party]]. Later she took part behind the front lines in the [[Spanish civil war]].

In 1933, she presented herself to the newly arrived Brecht and his wife [[Helene Weigel]], then staying on the island of [[Funen|Fyn]],&lt;ref&gt;maybe Thurø instead; see [http://www.fembio.org/biographie.php/frau/biographie/ruth-berlau/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; and within two years had become his lover. In 1936,&lt;ref&gt;or 1939 [http://www.fembio.org/biographie.php/frau/biographie/ruth-berlau/ ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt; she divorced the doctor Robert Lund and threw herself into a collaboration with Brecht, acting as a secretary as well as writing, translating, photographing and directing. With Brecht, Berlau published the short story collection ''Jedes Tier kann es'', considered obscene in its time. In 1940, she followed the Brecht clan to Sweden, Finland, the USSR and finally to the United States, where a rupture with Brecht took place in 1944. In New York,&lt;ref&gt;or Los Angeles, [http://www.fembio.org/biographie.php/frau/biographie/ruth-berlau/ ibid]&lt;/ref&gt; she gave birth to her only child, who was premature and only lived for a few days.

After the war, she followed the Brechts to Berlin, but was blacklisted from the [[Berliner Ensemble]] by Weigel, after Brecht's death in 1956. She died in the [[Charité]] hospital after setting her bed alight with a cigarette.

'''Soyuzmultfilm''' ({{lang-rus|Союзмультфильм|p=səjʉsmʊlʲtˈfʲilʲm}} {{Audio|Ru-Soyuzmultfilm.ogg|listen}}, ''Union Cartoon'') is a [[Russia]]n animation studio based in [[Moscow]]. Over the years it has gained international attention and respect, garnering numerous awards both at home and abroad. Noted for a great variety of style, it is regarded as the most influential animation studio of the former [[Soviet Union]]. The studio has produced 1,582 films {{as of|2018|08|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animator.ru/db/?ver=eng&amp;p=show_studia&amp;sid=16&amp;sp=2 |title=Russian animation in letters and figures &amp;#124; Studies &amp;#124; SOYUZMULTFILM |publisher=Animator.ru |date= |accessdate=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is currently divided into two studios: Creative Union of the Soyuzmultfilm Film Studio («Творческо-производственное объединение «Киностудия «Союзмультфильм») and the Soyuzmultfilm Film Fund («Фильмофонд Киностудии «Союзмультфильм»).

==History==
===Soviet era===
[[Image:Vinni pukh by fjodor khitruk.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Winnie-the-Pooh (1969 film)|Winnie-the-Pooh]] by Soyuzmultfilm]]
The studio was founded on 10 June 1936 under the name Soyuzdetmultfilm (Союздетмультфильм – abbr. from Union Children's Animations).  The name was changed to Soyuzmultfilm on 20 August 1937. Initially comprising only a few scattered workshops, Soyuzmultfilm grew quickly, soon becoming the Soviet Union's premier animation studio.  The studio produced exclusively [[traditional animation]] until 1954, when a "puppet division" was founded and the studio's first [[stop motion]]-animated film released.  The puppet division would later also make [[cutout animation|cutout-animated]] films.

During the Soviet era, the studio employed a maximum of over 700&lt;ref name="audio" /&gt; skilled labourers and released an average of 20 films each year (the highest number was 47, in 1973). The studio was one of the most ethnically-integrated cultural industries in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Maya Balakirsky Katz, Drawing the Iron Curtain: Jews and the Golden Age of Soviet Animation (Rutgers University Press, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next five decades, many Soyuzmultfilms contained characters who would eventually become an integral part of Soviet culture, such as ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh (1969 film)|Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' ({{lang|ru|Винни-Пух}}), ''[[Crocodile Gena]]'' ({{lang|ru|Крокодил Гена}}), ''[[Film, Film, Film]]'' ({{lang|ru|Фильм, фильм, фильм}}), ''[[Karlsson-on-the-Roof]]'' ({{lang|ru|Карлсон, который живёт на крыше}}), ''[[Town Musicians of Bremen (film)|The Musicians of Bremen]]'' ({{lang|ru|Бременские музыканты}}), ''[[Three from Prostokvashino]]'' ({{lang|ru|Трое из Простоквашино}}), ''[[Nu, pogodi!]]'' ({{lang|ru|Ну, погоди!}}), ''[[Hedgehog in the Fog]]'' ({{lang|ru|Ёжик в тумане}}), and ''[[The Mystery of the Third Planet]]'' ({{lang|ru|Тайна третьей планеты}}).

The variety of animation styles and the unprecedented degree of artistic freedom given to its many animators made Soyuzmultfilm perhaps the most diverse of the world's major animation studios. Soyuzmultfilm's creativity was fueled in part by the socialist economy of the Soviet Union, which obviated the goal of profitability. Because animators were paid by the Academy of Film regardless of how well or how poorly their products sold (though they were not, in fact, "sold"), they were free to pursue their artistic vision without giving a thought to finances.

===Decline===
[[Image:Hedgehogprint2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Hedgehog in the Fog]] by Soyuzmultfilm]]
The collapse of the Soviet Union brought to a close the golden era of Soyuzmultfilm. New economic realities made it impossible for the government to support the studio any longer.
In 1989, Soyuzmultfilm was made into a [[lease]]d enterprise (expiring after 10 years) and forced into the capitalist marketplace.

Although the studio survived, it shrank dramatically, losing nearly 90% of its staff and releasing only a few films. One early misfortune happened when the [[Russian courts]] transferred the studio's puppet division building (in a legal decision involving many other buildings) to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Before the animators could react to this turn of events, an [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Cossack]] squadron, accompanied by religious locals, broke into the building with swords unsheathed for the purpose of [[exorcism]] and began throwing out the "satanic puppets animated with the blood of Christian babies".&lt;ref&gt;Bossart, Alla.

[[Novaya Gazeta]]. 22-03-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; No studio employees were allowed to come in and salvage any item, despite the presence of much expensive equipment and a whole library of puppets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utro.ru/articles/2005/06/29/453479.shtml |title=Йскэрспю: Феярнйхе Ашкх "Тюапхйх Яйюгнй" |publisher=Utro.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main reason for the collapse, however, was the studio's deliberate dismantling by the new top management and the illegal selling off of its assets for personal gain (see:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animator.ru/articles/article.phtml?id=28 |title=бОЙНБФПТ.ТХ &amp;#124; уФБФШЙ &amp;#124; зЕПТЗЙК вПТПДЙО "ртпэбк, "упаънхмшфжймшн"!" |publisher=Animator.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; – in Russian). In 1992–1993, Sergei Skulyabin was elected president.

===Soyuzmultfilm today===
[[Image:Nu pogodi by vjacheslav kotenochkin.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Nu, pogodi!]] by Soyuzmultfilm]]
In 1999, Soyuzmultfilm came back under the control of the government. A government edict on 12 August 2003&lt;ref&gt;[http://pravo.roskultura.ru/documents/115797/]&lt;/ref&gt; divided the company into two separate companies. The separation was finalised on 1 March 2004.

The rights of all Soyuzmultfilm films before 1 March 2004 belong to the "Soyuzmultfilm Film Fund", headed by Ernest Rakhimov, and its official mission is restoring and marketing them.  The mission of the "Creative union of the "Film studio "Soyuzmultfilm", headed by Akop Kirakosyan, is to create new films (anywhere from 3–7 short films a year) and to eventually privatize itself (currently, 100% of its stock is owned by the Russian Ministry of Culture).

The next year, Soyuzmultfilm created an animated opening title for the children's TV show ''[[Ulitsa Sezam]]''.

In August 2013, the studio relocated to Moscow's Design Bureau of Film Equipment, after spending 68 years in their former premises. According to artistic director Michael Aldashin, "Everything must be decided within a year. There are too many technical and bureaucratic problems, but we are clearly moving." Aldashin also cited the limited space in the premises as a factor behind the move.&lt;ref name=moscow-times&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/arts_n_ideas/article/oldest-film-studio-to-transform/483621.html|title=Oldest Film Studio to Transform|date=25 July 2013|accessdate=18 August 2013|work=[[The Moscow Times]]|issue=5176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, Soyuzmultfilm is contemplating the production of computer-animated and educational films, as well as video games.&lt;ref name=moscow-times/&gt; Since the early 2000s, the studio has worked on the upcoming feature film ''[[Hoffmaniada]]''.&lt;ref name=moscow-times/&gt; Backed by [[Mikhail Shemyakin]] and directed by [[Stanislav Sokolov]], it will be based on the tales of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]. The film will use [[stop motion]] animation exclusively and will avoid using computer animation for special effects. The first 20 minutes were screened on 20 November 2006, in [[Saint Petersburg]],&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.ntv.ru/98119 |title=Шемякин оживил сказки Гофмана (video) |date=November 20, 2006 |accessdate=December 16, 2006 |publisher=НТВ (NTV.ru) |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the full film is planned for a 2016 release.&lt;ref name=moscow-times/&gt;

==Films by Jove controversy==
In 1992,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2981688.stm BBC News-Entertainment-Battle over classic Russian cartoons]&lt;/ref&gt; the studio signed a deal with the American company Films by Jove, owned by Russian [[immigrant]] actor [[Oleg Vidov]] and his American wife Joan Borsten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNary|first=David|title=From Russia With Love: Studio City Company to Release Stockpile of Animated Movies|date=31 May 1997|work=[[Daily News of Los Angeles]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83868719.html --&gt; It was the first international offer that the studio had received.  The deal stipulated that Films by Jove would be granted the rights to 547 of the most popular classic studio films for a period of 10 years in all territories except the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]; as part of the return, Soyuzmultfilm would receive 37% of the net profits. Films by Jove restored many of the films and released many of them on television, video and DVD in the United States and Europe, albeit usually with dubbed voices and changed music.[[Image:Bremenskie muzykanty.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[The Bremen Town Musicians (film)|The Bremen Town Musicians]] by Soyuzmultfilm]]

According to current director Akop Kirakosyan, the original deal seemed promising at the time but turned out to be "deadly" for the studio.  The expected payouts never materialized because Films by Jove never posted any net profits; all of the money officially went to things such as new soundtracks, lawsuits and copy protection measures.&lt;ref name="audio"&gt;[http://www.cultradio.ru/doc.html?id=115044&amp;cid=46 Radio interview with Akop Kirakosyan] (partially transcribed), 13-04-2007. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether either deal was legal was debated in court, with the Soyuzmultfilm Film Fund (see section below) claiming that because the company's lease on its possessions would have expired in 1999 (at which time ownership would have automatically reverted to the government if no new lease were signed), Soyuzmultfilm had no authority to issue rights that lasted beyond that timeframe.&lt;ref name="vedomosti2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2007/04/11/123914 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502104523/https://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2007%2F04%2F11%2F123914 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-05-02 |title=ВЕДОМОСТИ – Чебурашка лучше Фаберже – Алишер Усманов поможет ушастому зверю вернуться в Россию |publisher=Vedomosti.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Borsten presented a different story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/vidov031303.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107130725/http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/vidov031303.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-11-07 |title=Statement of FILMS BY JOVE INC |publisher=Judiciary.house.gov |date=2003-03-13 |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the Russian courts sided with Soyuzmultfilm and the American courts sided with Films by Jove.

U.S. Federal Court found that the Russian government has twice tried to invalidate Judge Trager's August 2001 summary judgment decision in favor of Films By Jove and transfer the copyrights to a library of 1,500 animated films, which Films by Jove licensed from Soyuzmultfilm Studios in 1992 to a new state-owned company. The judge found evidence of "continued actions being taken by the Russian government and judiciary to influence the outcome of this United States litigation with the purpose of depriving plaintiff Films by Jove of its right to distribute the animated films in the United States and elsewhere outside the former Soviet Union." The voulminous and very thorough decision further noted that, "In the case at bar, expropriation of the property of an American company by an act of a foreign sovereign is unquestionably against the public policy of the United States." &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2981688.stm Films by Jove Wins Critical Decision in Russian Video Piracy Lawsuit; Ruling Finds Improprieties in Russian Judicial Proceedings]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awn.com/news/new-york-court-favors-films-jove-over-russian-film-dupes New York Court Favors Films by Jove Over Russian Film Dupes-Animation World Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April 2007, Russian businessman [[Alisher Usmanov]] announced that he was in the final stages of negotiating a price with Films by Jove to buy back the collection. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070905006228/en/Films-Jove-Sells-Award-Winning-Animation-Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  A source close to Usmanov said that Films by Jove's initial price was $10 million, while Usmanov is willing to pay "several times less", as he considers that the rights already belong to Soyuzmultfilm and that he himself is only buying the physical film prints.&lt;ref name="vedomosti2007"/&gt; In September 2007, the deal was finalized, and Usmanov handed everything over to Russian state children's TV channel [[Bibigon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top.rbc.ru/economics/05/09/2007/117322.shtml |title=А.Усманов вернул советские мультфильмы в Россию :: Экономика |publisher=Top.rbc.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreliable sources|date=February 2017}}

A '''standalone film''' is a film that does not have any relation with other films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/standalone|title=The definition of standalone|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1900s, it was typical to create standalone films with no plans for sequels. The term "standalone film" appeared when sequels, spin-offs, and franchises became normal.{{when|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agonybooth.com/isnt-every-movie-a-standalone-movie-27272|title=Isn’t every movie a standalone movie?|website=Agonybooth.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of standalone films==
===Standalone film===
In a canonical meaning, a standalone film is a film that is not part of any [[Franchise (media)|franchise]]. [[The Sixth Sense]], [[The Shawshank Redemption]], and [[Inception]] are examples of standalone films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/10-standalone-films-that-deserve-sequels-more-than-fast-and-furious-7-does-15057|title=10 Standalone Films That Deserve Sequels More Than Fast And Furious 7 Does |date=6 October 2015|website=Nme.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="den"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/cinematic-universes/245802/why-movie-universes-need-standalone-films|title=Why Movie Universes Need Standalone Films|website=Denofgeek.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standalone sequel===
When a film is set in either the same universe or one very similar to that of its predecessors, yet has very little if any narrative connection to its predecessors and can be appreciated on its own without a thorough understanding of the backstory, then the work can be referred to as a standalone sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Andre-Driussi|title=Lexicon Urthus, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9neV_vyIX14C&amp;pg=PP21|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=1 August 2008|publisher=Sirius Fiction|isbn=978-0-9642795-1-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mad Max]] sequels, [[The Road Warrior]], [[Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome]], and [[Mad Max: Fury Road]], are examples of standalone sequels.

===Standalone spin-off===
A standalone spin-off is a film that expands some fictional universe. The [[Star Wars#Anthology films|Star Wars Anthology]] series is an example of standalone spin-offs.&lt;ref name="den"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patti J. McCarthy|title=The Lucas Effect: George Lucas and the New Hollywood|url=https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=Ccp1CgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22standalone+film%22&amp;hl=uk&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=11 February 2017|date=25 October 2014|publisher=Teneo Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standalone spin-offs may also be centered on a minor character from an existing fictional universe.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

'''''Street Legal''''' is a [[Street racing#Video games|street racing]] [[video game]] made by [[Invictus Games (company)|Invictus]] and [[Activision]] with a heavy emphasis on car customization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamezone.com/gamesell/p21079.htm|title=Street Legal|publisher=GameZone|accessdate=July 29, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610051810/http://pc.gamezone.com/gamesell/p21079.htm|archivedate=June 10, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game takes place in the fictitious Valo City. There are four sections of the city, although only one is unlocked from the beginning of the game. Other parts of the city, as well as more available cars and upgrade parts, are unlocked by racing against CPU drivers.

The cars in the game are all fictitious look-alikes of real vehicles. Examples are the "Ninja", a vehicle resembling a [[Honda Civic]] hatchback but bearing resemblance to other hatchbacks, and the "Badge", which mimics the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]].

The gameplay is highly mechanically-oriented - nearly every part on every car is replaceable. While the level of detail is not quite equal to that of the sequel game, [[Street Legal Racing: Redline]], entire engines may be replaced and almost all body parts can be removed from the vehicle. Damage in the game is also highly detailed - unfortunately, there is no way to repair the entire car after it has been damaged, meaning that repairs are costly and require lots of time to make.

==Development==
The game, developed in 2002, has relatively advanced graphics for its time. However, the game's coding was written in a way which made it run slowly, even on computers which met the recommended system requirements. Patches have been written for the game which improve the game's performance greatly and reduce the number of bugs.

==Sequels==
A sequel, called ''[[Street Legal Racing: Redline]]'' (also known as ''Street Legal 2'') was developed by Invictus in 2003.

'''Super Imaginative Chogokin''' (aka '''S.I.C.''') is one of [[Bandai]]'s popular line-up of die-cast metallic figurines (''[[chogokin]]'') based on the [[Kamen Rider]] franchise and other characters created by [[Shotaro Ishinomori]] and his production company. The figures are usually modified and differ from its counterpart as seen in the series. It is intended for those riders to closely resemble the ones portrayed in the [[manga]] and to have a much darker theme. S.I.C. figures are mostly sculpted by Takayuki Takeya and Kenji Ando.

==History==
The S.I.C. product line is made up of 1/10-scale action figures (typical height is 7"/18&amp;nbsp;cm). The line debuted in December 1998 with its first figure, Volume 01: [[Kikaider (character)|Kikaider]]. Popularity grew for S.I.C. due to its reimagination of the original comic book character. S.I.C. pays homage to the late [[Shotaro Ishinomori|Ishinomori Shotaro]]. The designs of S.I.C. reinterprets the original artwork by Ishinomori. The first ten volumes were only statuettes that were mounted on a stand but Volume 11: Side Machine and Kikaider marked a milestone for S.I.C. The figure was given very articulate joints because this set included a figure and a bike.

==Spin-offs==
Due to its overwhelming popularity, many spin-off lines were created. The first is S.I.C. Takumi-Damashii which essentially are small figurines based on their S.I.C. counterpart. A similar S.I.C. line based on the tokusatsu show GARO was created in 2006, called Equip and Prop. Another line is called [[Rangers Strike]] Solid, It was released in March 2007, It Is similar to the S.I.C. Takumi-Damashii but their poses were based on a card line by [[Cardass]] itself &amp; it was dedicated to the long-running [[Super Sentai]]. The Movie Realization line debut in 2004. Similar to S.I.C. it features characters such as Devilman, Kamen Rider, Evangelion, [[Spider-Man]], and [[Batman]]. By 2009, the newest line of S.I.C. which is smaller than a standard version called S.I.C. Kiwami-Tamashii, it will release on January, the first release featured the character [[Kamen Rider Hibiki (character)|Kamen Rider Hibiki]].

S.I.C. Takumi Damashii (TD) are similar to its parent model S.I.C., they both take works created by [[Ishinomori Shotaro]] but TDs are different because they are a lot smaller and are statuettes which are sculpted in a pose already.

'''''The Adventures of Justine''''' is a series of seven erotic feature films and [[television film]]s featuring Daneen Boone as the heroine Justine Wilkenson.

== Plot ==
Justine is a precocious teenage student who dreams about the be-spectacled but handsome Professor Robson, a faculty member at the Topacre Academy for gifted young girls. Justine, along with several of the other girls, is infatuated with the Professor.

Justine and Robson are involved in each episode with archeological and erotic adventures ''à la'' [[Indiana Jones]], with bad guys trying to steal an ancient artifact but obviously being more interested in engaging in lots of sex acts and kidnapping Justine. Justine always manages one way or another to remain a virgin. Most episodes conclude with the suggestion that the adventure has simply been Justine's dream, daydream or fantasy.

The theme song "Justine" was written by Michael Sutton and Wendy Young. The film ''A Private Affair'' was written by [[Brian Clemens]].

'''''The Dark Elf Trilogy''''' is a prequel to the ''[[Icewind Dale Trilogy]]'' by [[R. A. Salvatore]]. [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], a [[Drow (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|drow]], or dark elf, was originally written as a supporting character in the ''Icewind Dale Trilogy'' to [[Wulfgar (Forgotten Realms)|Wulfgar]] the [[Barbarian (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|barbarian]]. However, the author soon realized how popular the character was, and Drizzt became the main character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rasalvatore.com/sidemenu/sampleChapters/de.html| title=Foreword by R. A. Salvatore| accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final book ''Sojourn'' made the [[New York Times Best Seller list]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DD1F3BF935A15756C0A967958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=salvatore+sojourn&amp;st=nyt| title= PAPERBACK BEST SELLERS: May 26, 1991| publisher=NY Times| accessdate=2008-03-11| date=1991-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works included==
The trilogy consists of:
#'''''[[Homeland (Forgotten Realms novel)|Homeland]]''''' (1990) — ''Homeland'' follows the story of Drizzt from around the time and circumstances of his birth and his upbringing amongst the [[Drow (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|drow]] (dark elves). The book takes the reader into [[Menzoberranzan]], the drow home city. From here, the reader follows Drizzt on his quest to follow his principles in a land where such feelings are threatened by all his family including his mother [[Matron Malice]]. In an essence, the book introduces Drizzt Do'Urden, one of Salvatore's more famous characters from the ''Icewind Dale Trilogy''.
#'''''[[Exile (Forgotten Realms novel)|Exile]]''''' (1990) — ''Exile'' tells the story of Drizzt outside of the drow cities in the open wilderness of the [[Underdark]]. For the ten years following his abandoning his house, he is left with no one but his faithful [[Guenhwyvar]], a magical panther he had acquired in ''Homeland''.  Drizzt is also met with great dangers that he meets with the business ends of his scimitars. Struggling with conflicting emotions, which involve his failure in Menzoberranzan and a deep grief for his father and friend Zaknafein, he makes his way to the surface to face newer dangers.
#'''''[[Sojourn (novel)|Sojourn]]''''' (1991) — ''Sojourn'' is the story of Drizzt coming to the surface of the world and facing adversity due to the infamy of his kin. It follows him trying to find his place among the humans that live between the city of Sundabar and Citadel Adbar. He is rejected, and hunted, before meeting and living with an elderly blind man known as Montolio DeBrouchee. Montolio teaches Drizzt what it means to become a [[Ranger (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|ranger]] and together they defend Mooshie's home against a raid by local orcs. Drizzt ultimately leaves the Sundabar area and makes his way to [[Sword Coast|Icewind Dale]] where he befriends Catti-brie and Bruenor Battlehammer and finds a place to call home.

==Characters==
*'''Roddy McGristle''' is a human bounty hunter, and has two dogs that he uses to hunt and wields an axe named "Bleeder." He seeks out the bounty on Drizzt, who kills one of the dogs and injures the other. Roddy's ear is lost and face is scarred when he chops down a tree with his axe - he persists in telling everyone that Drizzt injured him.  He begins to follow any rumors based upon Drizzt in order to get revenge upon him, using the deaths of the Thistledowns as an excuse to get men to help.  In actuality he cares little for the Thistledowns and later doesn't even care for the bounty, partly because it was determined that Drizzt was not involved in their murder.  Making the grudge personal, he eventually tracks Drizzt down to [[Icewind Dale]], but Roddy is easily defeated, though Drizzt could not bring himself to end the man's life. He is then driven from the mountain by Bruenor and is never heard from again.
*'''Clacker''' is a [[Pech (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|pech]], who is transformed into a [[Hook Horror]] by a human wizard. Under the effects of this spell, he forgets his name, much of his past, and eventually his mind begins to transform into that of a mindless beast. He meets Drizzt and Belwar Dissengulp as they journey through the Underdark. The three sought the wizard that cast the spell on Clacker; however, Clacker unwillingly killed him when a comment from the wizard drove him into a primal rage from his Hook Horror instincts. He eventually has a moment of resurgence, where he becomes more in-tune with the earth than a regular pech. He uses his abilities to save his friends, and then asks them to kill him before he completely turns. He is killed by Zaknafein, and his body, having returned to its true form, is placed into a pool of acid.
*'''Belwar Dissengulp''' is a former burrow-warden of the [[svirfneblin]], another humanoid race in the Underdark. Ten years prior to the events of Exile, Drizzt was part of a raiding party of Menzoberranzan who attacked a mining party of svirfneblin, led by Belwar. Again Drizzt's merciful nature showed, and he convinced his group to let Belwar live (using the excuse that he could serve as a warning to the svirfneblin against venturing so close to Menzoberranzan). However, Drizzt's brother, Dinin, decided to sever both his hands as an example. 10 years pending Drizzt's self-imposed exile, he ventured into the svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone, where he requested to speak with Belwar, whose hands had been replaced with a magical hammer and pickaxe. The former burrow-warden decided to take Drizzt into his home and keep responsibility for him, knowing that he owed his life to him. When Drizzt was forced to leave the city (the city fearing the drow hunting him), Belwar decided to join him in his adventures through the Underdark, and only left when Drizzt told of his intentions to go to the surface.
*'''Kellindil''' A wood elf, and part of Dove Falconhand's group, he meets Drizzt and attacks him assuming him the enemy, though pending the Drow's retreat and lack of violence toward him he suspects Drizzt's good intentions.  He then keeps an eye on Drizzt during the time he spent with Mooshie.  He and his elves arrive in time to offer some help in the attack from King Graul and his orcs.  He finds Roddy and takes him captive intending to question him.  However Roddy is freed and kills him.
*'''Montolio DeBrouchee''' is an aging Human ranger, nicknamed 'Mooshie.' Though he was blinded in a battle against a dragon, he learned to utilize his other senses, as well as his connection with nature, to make up for his disability. He is the one who discovered Drizzt's true calling as a Ranger and taught him how to embrace it and make use of his abilities. Soon before Mooshie's death, he coerced a promise from Drizzt to try to find a place in the world instead of lingering in the forest alone; as Mooshie died in his sleep, Drizzt honored his lost friend by keeping his promise.

==Comics==
The books have been adapted into comic book form by [[Devil's Due Publishing]]. The artist for the comic series Tim Seeley with Andrew Dabb as the writer under the supervision of [[R.A. Salvatore]].  The adaption of ''Homeland'', volume 1, received a positive review from George Galuschak of ''Kliatt'' magazine, who said, "I am not a big sword &amp; sorcery buff, but I enjoyed this graphic novel. The plot is easy to follow: you don't need a ''Forgotten Realms'' encyclopedia at your side to understand what's going on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-143627545.html | author=Galuschak, George | title=Salvatore, R.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2658">A '''theatre consultant''' is a [[consultant]] who specializes in the design of facilities for the [[performing arts]], equipment for those facilities and the operation of [[theatre]].

Professional consultants provide unbiased, functionally sound, practical consulting and design services for performance and public assembly facilities of all kinds.[[Architects and owners | Owners and architects]] use their expertise to programme, plan and help with the construction of these kinds of complicated buildings. Their [[professional organization]] in the [[United States]] is the [[American Society of Theatre Consultants]] (ASTC). The [[United Kingdom British | international]] equivalent organisation is the [[Society | Institute]] of Theatre Consultants [[(STC)| (IoTC)]].  There are also many Theatre Consultants that are not members of these organisations.  Unlike the practice of architecture or engineering, theatre consulting is not regulated by [[professional license, but the Institute of Theatre Consultants accredits Theatre Consultants on the basis of proven work, operates a Code of Practice and provides training to members]].

Consultants are generally expert in building codes and the requirements of the American with Disabilities Act as related to theatres, auditoria, and concert halls.  They typically provide detailed design for special theatre systems such as performance lighting systems, [[Fly system|stage rigging]], orchestra pit lifts, seating (fixed and movable), acoustical canopies and more.  Some theatre consulting firms also provide acoustical and/or audio-visual '''consulting''', although those are specialties in their own right.

Theatre Consultants may work directly for a facility or organisation, or they may be contracted as a specialty (sub)consultant for a Project Architect or Engineer.  Services can range from programmatic planning for the development of new facilities, planning for the refurbishment or repurposing of existing facilities, or just (re)design or assessment of specific production systems.

}}
The '''Theatres Act 1843''' (6 &amp; 7 Vict., c. 68) (also known as the '''Theatre Regulation Act''') was an [[Act of Parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom]].  It amended the regime established under the [[Licensing Act 1737]] for the licensing of the [[theatre]] in Great Britain, implementing the proposals made by a [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 1832.   

Under the [[Licensing Act 1737]] (10 Geo.II, c. 28), the [[Lord Chamberlain]] was granted the ability to vet the performance of any new plays: he could prevent any new play, or any modification to an existing play, from being performed for any reason, and was not required to justify his decision.  New plays were required to be submitted to the Lord Chamberlain for a licence before they could be performed, and theatre owners could be prosecuted for staging a play (or part of a play) that had not received prior approval. A licence, once granted, could be also withdrawn.  The Licensing Act 1737 also limited spoken drama to the [[patent theatre]]s, originally only the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]] in [[London]].  The regime was relaxed slightly by the [[Theatrical Representations Act 1788]], under which local [[magistrate]]s were permitted to license occasional performances for periods of up to 60 days.

The Theatres Act 1843 restricted the powers of the Lord Chamberlain, so that he could only prohibit the performance of plays where he was of the opinion that "it is fitting for the preservation of good manners, decorum or of the public peace so to do".  It also gave additional powers to [[local authority|local authorities]] to license theatres, breaking the monopoly of the patent theatres and encouraging the development of popular theatrical entertainments, such as saloon theatres attached to [[public house]]s and [[music hall]]s. 

The regime established by the 1843 Act was considered by a select committee of the House of Commons in 1866, and two Parliamentary Joint [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]]s, in 1909 and then in 1966, and various reforms were proposed, but no changes were implemented until the Act was finally repealed by the [[Theatres Act 1968]].

==Jurisdiction==
The Act in general was restricted to Great Britain, and more specifically to the vicinities of London, [[Oxbridge]], and [[List of British royal residences|royal residences]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean 2010 pp.13–15&lt;/ref&gt; When [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1909 play ''[[The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet]]'' was refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain, it was staged in Liverpool and Dublin by the [[Abbey Theatre]] players.&lt;ref&gt;Dean 2010 pp.88–96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibbs2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbs|first=A.|title=A Bernard Shaw Chronology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1h9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218|accessdate=20 November 2017|date=2001-02-14|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9780230599581|page=218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''''Three Hundred Words'''''" is a poem that showcases a number of [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper's]] [[literary technique]]s and characteristics.

According to Harper's spoken introduction on his 1992 Live album, ''[[Born in Captivity II]]'', (re-released in 1993 as ''[[Unhinged (album)|Unhinged]]'') "Three Hundred Words" was written for a benefit concert for [[Lancashire]] [[batsman]], [[Graeme Fowler]]. It not only concerns one of Harper's most oft-cited loves, [[cricket]] (see  "[[When An Old Cricketer Leaves The Crease]]", on the album [[HQ (album)|''HQ'']]), it also picks up the themes of [[England]], combining historical reminiscences with current events, using minor observations to make major (political) statements, [[Broken rhyme|breaking rhymes]] across lines, and using clever mixed [[metaphors]]. It is, therefore, quintessentially Harper.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
:I remember Pat Tetley,
:and romping in grass
:- that was tall -
:at the back of the [[Cricket pitch|cricket field]],
:trying to catch glimpses
:of [[panties|knickers]] and [[Buttocks|ass]],
:whilst over the fence
:the crowd yelled, ooh-ed and roared,
:as [[Sonny Ramadhin|Ramadhin]], [[Everton Weekes|Weekes]] and [[Frank Worrell]] all scored...

:(partial)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

[[Image:Circus-juggling.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Juggling pair performing basic two-person passing with clubs]]
'''Toss juggling''' is the form of [[juggling]] which is most recognisable as 'juggling'.&lt;ref&gt;Definitions of "juggling" limited to toss juggling:
*"Continuously toss into the air and catch (a number of objects) so as to keep at least one in the air while handling the others, typically for the entertainment of others." - "[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/juggle Juggle]", ''OxfordDictionaries.com''.
*"To keep several objects in motion in the air at the same time by repeatedly throwing and catching them." - "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/juggle Juggle]", ''Merriam-Webster.com''.
*"To keep (two or more objects) in the air at one time by alternately throwing and catching them." - (1983). ''American Heritage Dictionary''. Cited in Ernest, James (2011). ''Contact Juggling'', p.1. {{ISBN|9781591000273}}.
*"In the twenty-first century the term ''juggler'' is applied to that kind of entertainer who throws up objects from one hand to another in a continuous rhythmical sequence without dropping them to the floor." - Butterworth, Philip (2005). ''Magic on the Early English Stage'', p.3. {{ISBN|9780521825139}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Toss juggling can be used as: a [[performing art]], a [[sport]], a form of [[exercise]], as [[meditation]], a [[recreation]]al pursuit or hobby.

In toss juggling, objects &amp;mdash; such as [[juggling ball|balls]], [[bean bags]], [[juggling ring|rings]], [[Juggling club|clubs]], etc. &amp;mdash; are [[throwing|thrown]] or tossed into the air and caught. Toss juggling is a form of [[object manipulation]].

== Juggling techniques and patterns ==
{{See also|Juggling pattern}}

'Toss juggling' has a number of basic principles and patterns. Most of the more complex patterns are variations of the basic ones and all toss juggling must conform to these basic principles.

===Basic principles===
Toss juggling is, according to most sources, the throwing and catching of objects, where there are more objects than there are hands (or sometimes other parts of the body) doing the throwing and catching.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite web|url=http://www.jugglingdb.com/faq/index.php?question=1 |title="1. What is juggling?", ''IJDb'' |accessdate=2016-11-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201042130/http://www.jugglingdb.com/faq/index.php?question=1 |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |df= }}. Cited in Rosenberger, Phillip (2011). ''Juggling Basics, Why and How To''.&lt;!--unpaginated--&gt; {{ISBN|9780983339700}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Three balls thrown and caught between two hands is toss juggling, as there are more balls than hands. Two balls between two hands would not be considered toss juggling, as the number of balls and hands is equal.

===Basic patterns===
There are three basic patterns in toss juggling with many variations, some exceedingly complex, that are based on these basic patterns.

====Shower====
[[File:Douche3b.gif|45px|right|alt=Shower]]
The ''[[shower (juggling)|shower]]'' is the most commonly depicted pattern in pictures and illustrations of jugglers (although often wildly exaggerated). The objects juggled follow a circular pattern with one hand doing higher throws and the other passing or doing low throws to the first hand. This pattern can be used to juggle an odd number or even number of objects. In [[siteswap]] notation, a three object shower would be called 51.

====Cascade====
[[File:3-ball cascade movie.gif|45px|right|alt=Cascade]]
The ''[[cascade (juggling)|cascade]]'' pattern is often the first pattern taught to beginner jugglers. The objects juggled follow a horizontal figure of eight pattern with each hand throwing the object to the same height when the previous throw has reached it peak. This pattern is most commonly used to juggle an odd number of objects. In siteswap notation, a three object cascade would be called 3.

====Fountain====
[[File:4-ball juggling.gif|45px|right|alt=Fountain]]
The ''[[Fountain (juggling)|fountain]]'' is where each hand throws and catches objects and they do not transfer to the opposite hand. This pattern is most commonly used to juggle an even number of objects. In siteswap notation, a four object fountain would be called 4.

=== Advanced patterns and tricks ===
{{Main|Juggling pattern}}
[[File:Juggling trick 3b box.gif|45px|right|alt=Box]]
[[File:3-ball Columns.gif|45px|right|alt=Column]]
[[File:3-ball Mills mess.gif|45px|right|alt=Mill's mess]]

Besides the [[cascade (juggling)|cascade]] (or [[reverse cascade]]), other toss patterns include the ''[[box (juggling)|box]]'' or ''[[columns (juggling)|column]]'', and any number of [[Multiplex (juggling)|multiplex patterns]] or [[contact juggling]] tricks within the [[juggling pattern|pattern]].

There are also amusing stunts such as the  ''[[Yo-yo (juggling)|Yo-yo]]'' and the ''Robot'', which give the illusion that the balls are connected to each other or to the juggler's body.  By adding elementary skills to any juggling pattern the pattern can be increased, incrementally, in complexity.

There are even wildly intricate patterns such as the ''[[Mills Mess]], ''which is widely attributed to Steve Mills of The Dazzling Mills Family.  For a given pattern any number of variants may occur to the juggler, for instance, Mills Mess has at least three well-known variants, produced by adding flourishes such as ''[[Chops (juggling)|chops]]'', ''holds'', ''stalls'', and ''carries''.  "Mills" colloquially refers to any pattern in juggling where the hands cross back and forth over one another. Any pattern valid in siteswap notation can be done "vanilla", reverse, and in Mills.

=== Other patterns ===
Below is a list of other common three-ball patterns.

* [[Rubenstein's Revenge]]
* [[Flash (juggling)|Flash]]

== Performance ==
[[File:Firejuggling 2009 ubt.ogv|thumb|300px|Toss juggling - [[street performance]] in [[Denmark]]]]

Juggling has been used as a performance skill for thousands of years. Toss juggling has been significant in such performances and has continued to be a major part of juggling performances up to the present day. Juggling performances are of two main types: a performance which shows off the technical skill of the juggler and a performance of juggling with comedy. These two main types can be performed as shows, as walkabout entertainment or as stationary freestyle entertainment. All types of performances can be accompanied by music, other circus skills or other performers.

==Passing and feeding==
{{Main|Passing (juggling)}}
Passing is the juggling skill of throwing objects between two or more jugglers. The most common passing combination is where two jugglers throw six objects between them and perform various tricks in addition to that basic pattern. The number of objects juggled between two people can be increased with 7, 8 and even nine object passing being a common occurrence. Higher numbers have also been achieved with the current record for club passing being 13 clubs passed (juggled) between the two jugglers. 

A variation on passing, called ''feeding'', is performed by three or more jugglers. The most common combination is performed by three jugglers: one juggler (the ''feeder'') passes alternately to each of the other two jugglers (the ''feedees'') while they stand in a 'triangle'. The [[tempo]] of the juggling as well as the way the objects are thrown between the jugglers can be varied. Feeding can be performed with one feeder feeding multiple feedees or a mix of multiple feeders and feedees in one pattern.

Passing and feeding patterns and tricks in toss juggling range from the simple to the very complex. New patterns and tricks are developed and practiced at [[juggling conventions]].

== Sport ==
As a sport, juggling can be done competitively, with the jugglers attempting to improve upon the tricks or performances of other jugglers within a range of disciplines and categories. Competitions are held for both solo and multiple juggling competitors. [[Jason Garfield]] popularised this form of juggling in the USA. This style of juggling became more popular after he organised a [[World Juggling Federation]] competition in 2004 which has now become an annual event.

== Exercise and fitness ==
As [[exercise]], juggling is a highly [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] activity, increasing the [[heart rate]] and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Juggling helps one to develop good [[hand-eye coordination]], physical fitness and balance.

=== Reflexes ===
Juggling helps to develop quick [[reflex action|reflexes]], and in fact, jugglers develop "[[second-order conditioning|higher-order]] [[reflex]]es", reflexes not typically associated with normal human activity. These reflexes are formed through repetition of what are, at first, slowly learned and difficult processes. As the various processes develop into reflexive actions, additional, more difficult or complex skills are 'layered' atop previous, well-developed skills. These new more complex skills eventually become more reflexive, and eventually, various unusual high order reflexes develop. An example is that, while catching a raw chicken's [[egg (biology)|egg]] may be quite challenging to a novice juggler, a more skilled juggler might be able to easily catch &amp;mdash; unbroken &amp;mdash; an egg thrown towards him without warning.

== Meditation ==
Paradoxically, the same processes that are well known for exercising the body, can also be a very relaxing activity.  As [[meditation]], juggling a repeating pattern or patterns can take one's mind off the stresses they might encounter in their daily lives.  Jugglers have described a phenomenon of near-disembodiment and tranquility which may come over them while juggling.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  The constant rising and falling of the objects, the regularity of the rhythms, can become almost hypnotic, and the attention of a juggler while tightly focused on the juggling pattern may seem to expand and even to "encompass the universe."

== Recreation ==
As a recreational pursuit, juggling excels in many ways.  Besides the previously mentioned health benefits, any form of juggling is at its best when done socially.  The equipment is inexpensive or free &amp;mdash; though very costly equipment is also available &amp;mdash; and easily portable.  Juggling is great for "breaking the ice" at parties and other social gatherings {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}.  Jugglers are a friendly sort, usually, and are often very willing to help beginning jugglers with advice.  [[Juggling convention]]s, clubs and other gatherings where jugglers congregate can be great places to meet and share the art of juggling, for experts novices and even 'non-jugglers' &amp;mdash; who often find themselves doing some form of juggling themselves.

In 1990 it was estimated by the [[International Jugglers' Association]] that twenty-three percent of Americans can juggle a three-ball cascade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juggle.org/history/archives/jugmags/42-3/42-3,p12.htm ''Juggler's World'' Vol. 42 #3]. Cited in Havlick, Joseph T. (2008). ''The Effect of Varying Imagery Perspective and Modality on Juggling Skill Acquisition Using Internet-based, Modular Instruction'', p.97. Temple University. {{ISBN|9780549775423}}.&lt;!--Havlick attributes the study to the [[Juggling Information Service]], probably because they make the IJA publication available, but the article specifically attributes IJA and does not mention JIS.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Yoostar''''' is a video-based gaming system developed by Yoostar Entertainment Group that allows users to insert themselves into movie or television scenes to perform with the films' original actors and post the resultant video on the Yoostar web site, as well as in third-party [[social networking]] environments like [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]] or [[MySpace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Struck | first = Heather| title = Yoostar's Hollywood Dreams | publisher = Forbes | url = https://www.forbes.com/2009/05/14/yoostar-movies-media-technology-personal-tech-yoostar.html| date = 14 March 2009|archiveurl=https://archive.is/KObo|archivedate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is a video [[karaoke]], judging individuals performances.

YooStar Entertainment's first product – ''YooStar 1'', for [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Macintosh|Mac]] – was initially released in an exclusive marketing partnership with the [[Bloomingdale's]] department store chain on August 26, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yoostar-available-today-in-bloomingdales-stores-nationwide-62062477.html| title = Yoostar Available Today in Bloomingdale's Stores Nationwide | publisher = PR Newswire | date = 26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
To populate the ''Yoostar'' clip library, in-house artists digitally erase actors or other key figures in a licensed film or television clip. The company has patented this technique.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}The user films him- or herself saying either the original lines from the clip using the software’s teleprompter, or ad-libbing their own version. A chalk outline is overlaid on the scene to help position the user in scale with the other actors. The user is allowed as many takes as needed to get a satisfactory result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Baig | first = Edward| title = Yoostar lets anyone act opposite Hepburn, Brando | publisher = USA Today | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/edwardbaig/2009-09-02-yoostar_N.htm| date = 2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software then composites the user’s filmed content with the original clip in the same fashion Hollywood actors are filmed against [[green screen]]s on set and inserted into digitally created backgrounds. The final product is then labeled and stored on the user's local machine, with the option to upload to Yoostar's website. The site provides the ability to embed content in any [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]-supporting [[HTML]] environment using raw code, or in [[blogging]] platforms and social networking sites such as Facebook. Yoostar site users can rate, comment, and share content with the public or a group of "[[Friend_(Facebook)#Friend|Friends]]," depending on each clip's settings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Yoostar 2==
On Tuesday June 15, 2010, to coincide with the beginning of the 2010 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], Yoostar announced a second version of the game and launched a new website called ''Yoostar 2''. ''Yoostar 2'' is playable via the [[Xbox 360]] ([[Kinect]] required) and [[PlayStation 3]] ([[PlayStation Eye]] required, [[PlayStation Move]] optional) video game consoles. Yoostar2 includes 80 film scenes from major Hollywood studios.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Yoostar 2'', for the [[Xbox 360]] [[Kinect]] and [[PlayStation Move]] released in North America on March 8, 2011. In the fall of 2011, Yoostar cooperated with MTV to allow users to star in scenes from MTV's TV shows and music videos. ''Yoostar on MTV'', for [[Xbox 360]] [[Kinect]] released in North America on November 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-release-of-yoostar-on-mtv-for-the-xbox-360-makes-kinect-owners-the-star-in-mtv-shows-and-music-videos-2011-11-15| title=The Release of 'Yoostar on MTV' for the Xbox 360 Makes Kinect Owners the Star in MTV Shows and Music Videos| publisher = MarketWatch, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Yoshimoto Mugendai Hall'''|ヨシモト∞ホール|Yoshimoto Mugendai Hōru}} is a public indoor [[stage (theatre)|stage]] owned by the Japanese [[entertainment]] conglomerate [[Yoshimoto Kogyo|Yoshimoto Kōgyō]] situated in  [[Shibuya, Tokyo]]. The stage opened on March 25, 2006 and has since staged the ''Yoshimoto Mugendai'' event hosting daily [[owarai]] performances and live broadcasts on [[television]] and over the internet. ''Yoshimoto Mugendai'', which commenced on November 11, 2005,  was held at the now closed Ariake Studio prior to the opening of Yoshimoto Mugendai Hall.

''Mugendai'' means "infinity" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and the symbol [[∞]], often replaces the word itself in casual Japanese writing.

==Live event==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:YOOH.png|right|100px]] --&gt;
The daily live performances (open free to the public) are hosted by popular owarai duo [[Oriental Radio]] from approximately 4-6 [[12-hour clock|pm]] and comedian [[Hosshan]] from approximately 6-9 pm. For the purposes of the show, the hosts are referred to as "navigators". The entire 5 hours is broadcast live on the Yoshimoto's television channel, [[Fandago TV]], which is dedicated to broadcasting live ''owarai'' acts and Yoshimoto [[Variety show|variety]], and is also broadcast over the internet.

The contents of each show generally rotate according to a weekly schedule featuring many [[Glossary of owarai terms#corner|corners]] common to Japanese television, although guests and special appearances on the stage vary widely from day to day. Almost all of the guests on ''Yoshimoto Mugendai'' are minor Yoshimoto comedians, although much more famous acts (such as [[Jicho Kacho|Jichō Kachō]]) have made appearances in the past.

There is an official monthly [[magazine]] for Yoshimoto Mugendai and the hall called YOOH! (shown right), featuring interviews with the guests and information on future shows.
