      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5527">[[Image:RibonucleaseA SS paleRib.png|thumb|right| Folded, 3-D structure of ribonuclease A]]
'''Anfinsen's dogma''' (also known as the '''thermodynamic hypothesis''') is a postulate in [[molecular biology]] that states that, at least for a small globular protein in its standard physiological environment, the [[protein structure|native structure]] is determined only by the protein's [[amino acid]] [[primary structure|sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Anfinsen CB | title=Principles that govern the folding of protein chains | journal=Science | volume=181 |issue=4096 |year=1973 | pages=223–230 | pmid=4124164 | doi=10.1126/science.181.4096.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dogma was championed by the [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize Laureate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1972/press.html|title=Press Release: The 1972 Nobel Prize in Chemistry|website=Nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian B. Anfinsen]] from his research on the folding of ribonuclease A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=White FH | title=Regeneration of native secondary and tertiary structures by air oxidation of reduced ribonuclease | journal=J. Biol. Chem. | volume=236 |year=1961 | pages=1353–1360 | pmid=13784818}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Anfinsen CB, Haber E, Sela M, ((White FH Jr)) | title=The kinetics of formation of native ribonuclease during oxidation of the reduced polypeptide chain | journal=PNAS | volume=47 | issue=9 |year=1961 | pages=1309–1314 | pmid=13683522 | doi=10.1073/pnas.47.9.1309 | pmc=223141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The postulate amounts to saying that, at the environmental conditions (temperature, solvent concentration and composition, etc.) at which folding occurs, the native structure is a unique, stable and kinetically accessible minimum of the free energy.
The three conditions:

:'''Uniqueness''': requires that the sequence does not have any other configuration with a comparable free energy. Hence the free energy minimum must be ''unchallenged''.

:'''Stability''': small changes in the surrounding environment cannot give rise to changes in the minimum configuration. This can be pictured as a free energy surface that looks more like a funnel (with the native state in the bottom of it) rather than like a soup plate (with several closely related low-energy states); the free energy surface around the native state must be rather steep and high, in order to provide stability.

:'''Kinetical accessibility''': means that the path in the free energy surface from the unfolded to the folded state must be reasonably smooth or, in other words, that the folding of the chain must not involve highly complex changes in the shape (like knots or other high order conformations).

How the protein reaches this structure is the subject of the field of [[protein folding]], which has a related concept called [[Levinthal's paradox]]. The Levinthal paradox states that the number of possible conformations available to a given protein is astronomically large, such that even a small protein of 100 residues would require more time than the universe has existed (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) to explore all possible conformations and choose the appropriate one, it would also arguably make computational prediction of protein structures under the same basis unfeasible if not impossible.

Also, some proteins need the assistance of another protein called a [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperone protein]] to fold properly. It has been suggested that this disproves Anfinsen's dogma. However, the chaperones do not appear to affect the final state of the protein; they seem to work primarily by preventing [[Protein aggregation|aggregation]] of several protein molecules prior to the final folded state of the protein.

[[Prion]]s are an exception to Anfinsen's dogma. Prions are stable conformations of proteins which differ from the native folding state. In [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (Mad Cow Disease), native proteins re-fold into a different stable conformation, which causes fatal [[amyloid]] buildup. Other amyloid diseases, including [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], are also exceptions to Anfinsen's dogma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/rhoadeslab/research.html |title=Protein Folding and Misfolding |publisher=Yale University Rhoades Lab |accessdate=2012-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719110222/http://www.yale.edu/rhoadeslab/research.html |archivedate=2012-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Puffinus puffinus -Iceland -flying-6 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Manx shearwater]]s can fly straight home when released, navigating thousands of miles over land or sea.]]

'''Animal navigation''' is the ability of many animals to find their way accurately without maps or instruments. Birds such as the [[Arctic tern]], insects such as the [[Monarch (butterfly)|monarch butterfly]] and fish such as the [[salmon]] regularly [[Animal migration|migrate]] thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds,&lt;ref name="DingleDrake"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dingle, Hugh |author2=Drake, V. Alistair |year=2007 |title=What is migration? |journal=BioScience |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=113–121 |url= http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1641/B570206 |doi=10.1641/B570206}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.

[[Dead reckoning]], navigating from a known position using only information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1873 as a possible mechanism. In the 20th century, [[Karl von Frisch]] showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they rely on the sun when possible. [[William Tinsley Keeton]] showed that [[homing pigeons]] could similarly make use of a range of navigational cues, including the sun, [[earth's magnetic field]], [[olfaction]] and vision. [[Ronald Lockley]] demonstrated that a small seabird, the [[Manx shearwater]], could orient itself and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were visible.

Several species of animal can integrate cues of different types to orient themselves and navigate effectively. Insects and birds are able to combine learned landmarks with sensed direction (from the [[earth's magnetic field]] or from the sky) to identify where they are and so to navigate. Internal 'maps' are often formed using vision, but other senses including [[olfaction]] and [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] may also be used.

The ability of wild animals to navigate may be adversely affected by products of human activity. For example, there is evidence that pesticides may interfere with bee navigation, and that lights may harm turtle navigation.

==Early research==

[[File:Waggle dance.png|thumb|upright|[[Karl von Frisch]] (1953) discovered that [[European honey bee|honey bee]] workers can navigate, and indicate the range and direction to food to other workers with a [[waggle dance]].]]
In 1873, [[Charles Darwin]] wrote a letter to [[Nature (magazine)|''Nature'' magazine]], arguing that animals including man have the ability to navigate by dead reckoning, even if a magnetic 'compass' sense and the ability to navigate by the stars is present:&lt;ref name="DarwinNature"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |date=24 April 1873 |title=Origin of Certain Instincts |journal=Nature |volume=7 |pages=417–418 |doi=10.1038/007417a0 |issue=179| url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F1760&amp;pageseq=1 |bibcode=1873Natur...7..417D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|With regard to the question of the means by which animals find their way home from a long distance, a striking account, in relation to man, will be found in the English translation of the Expedition to North [[Siberia]], by [[Ferdinand von Wrangel|Von Wrangell]].{{efn|The book was ''A Journey on the Northern Coast of Siberia and the Icy Sea'' (2 vols.), London, 1841. ''Wrangel'' is variously spelt ''Vrangel'' or ''Wrangell''.}} He there describes the wonderful manner in which the natives kept a true course towards a particular spot, whilst passing for a long distance through hummocky ice, with incessant changes of direction, and with no guide in the heavens or on the frozen sea. He states (but I quote only from memory of many years standing) that he, an experienced surveyor, and using a compass, failed to do that which these savages easily effected. Yet no one will suppose that they possessed any special sense which is quite absent in us. We must bear in mind that neither a compass, nor the north star, nor any other such sign, suffices to guide a man to a particular spot through an intricate country, or through hummocky ice, when many deviations from a straight course are inevitable, unless the deviations are allowed for, or a sort of "dead reckoning" is kept. All men are able to do this in a greater or less degree, and the natives of Siberia apparently to a wonderful extent, though probably in an unconscious manner. This is effected chiefly, no doubt, by eyesight, but partly, perhaps, by the sense of muscular movement, in the same manner as a man with his eyes blinded can proceed (and some men much better than others) for a short distance in a nearly straight line, or turn at right angles, or back again. The manner in which the sense of direction is sometimes suddenly disarranged in very old and feeble persons, and the feeling of strong distress which, as I know, has been experienced by persons when they have suddenly found out that they have been proceeding in a wholly unexpected and wrong direction, leads to the suspicion that some part of the brain is specialised for the function of direction.}}

Later in 1873, Joseph John Murphy{{efn|JJ Murphy (d 1894), of [[County Antrim]], was treasurer and then president of the [https://archive.org/stream/belfastliterarys00belf/belfastliterarys00belf_djvu.txt Belfast Literary Society]. He attempted to harmonise evolution and religion, publishing a book ''The Scientific Bases of Faith'' in 1872.}} replied to Darwin, writing back to ''Nature'' with a description of how he, Murphy, believed animals carried out dead reckoning, by what is now called [[inertial navigation]]:&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, J.J. ''Instinct: a Mechanical Analogy''. ''Nature'' 7:483. 24 April 1873. {{doi|10.1038/007483b0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|If a ball is freely suspended from the roof of a railway carriage it will receive a shock sufficient to move it, when the carriage is set in motion: and the magnitude and direction of the shock … will depend on the magnitude and direction of the force with which the carriage begins to move … [and so] … every change in … the motion of the carriage … will give a shock of corresponding magnitude and direction to the ball. Now, it is conceivably quite possible, though such delicacy of mechanism is not to be hoped for, that a machine should be constructed … for registering the magnitude and direction of all these shocks, with the time at which each occurred … from these data the position of the carriage … might be calculated at any moment.}}

[[Karl von Frisch]] (1886–1982) studied the [[European honey bee]], demonstrating that bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways: by the sun, by the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth’s magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark [[beehive]].{{sfn|von Frisch|1953|pp=93–96}}

[[William Tinsley Keeton]] (1933–1980) studied [[Homing (biology)|homing]] pigeons, showing that they were able to navigate using the [[earth's magnetic field]], the sun, as well as both [[Olfactory navigation|olfactory]] and visual cues.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Keeton|Keeton, William]] (1974) ''The orientational and navigational basis of homing in birds''. pages 47–132 in ''Advances in the Study of Behavior'', Vol. 5. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Griffin]] (1915–2003) studied [[Animal echolocation|echolocation in bats]], demonstrating that it was possible and that bats used this mechanism to detect and track prey, and to "see" and thus navigate through the world around them.&lt;ref name=GriffinNYT&gt;Yoon, Carol Kaesuk. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/14/nyregion/donald-r-griffin-88-dies-argued-animals-can-think.html ''Donald R. Griffin, 88, Dies; Argued Animals Can Think''], [[The New York Times]], 14 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Lockley]] (1903–2000), among many studies of birds in over fifty books, pioneered the science of bird migration. He made a twelve-year study of shearwaters such as the [[Manx shearwater]], living on the remote island of [[Skokholm]].{{sfn|Lockley|1942}} These small seabirds make one of the longest migrations of any bird—10,000 kilometres—but return to the exact nesting burrow on Skokholm year after year. This behaviour led to the question of how they navigated.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|pp=114–117}}

==Mechanisms==

Lockley began his book ''Animal Navigation'' with the words:{{sfn|Lockley|1967|p=9}}
{{quote|How do animals find their way over apparently trackless country, through pathless forests, across empty deserts, over and under featureless seas? ... They do so, of course, without any visible [[compass]], [[sextant]], [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] or [[Nautical chart|chart]]...}}

Many mechanisms have been proposed for animal navigation: there is evidence for a number of them. Investigators have often been forced to discard the simplest hypotheses - for example, some animals can navigate on a dark and cloudy night, when neither landmarks nor celestial cues like sun, moon, or stars are visible. The major mechanisms known or hypothesized are described in turn below.

=== Remembered landmarks ===

Animals including mammals, birds and insects such as bees and wasps (''[[Ammophila (Sphecidae)|Ammophila]]'' and ''[[Sphex]]''),{{sfn|Tinbergen|1984|pp=58–79}} are capable of learning landmarks in their environment, and of using these in navigation.&lt;ref&gt;Collett, Thomas S; Graham, Paul. "Animal Navigation: Path Integration, Visual Landmarks and Cognitive Maps" ''Current Biology'', Vol. 14, R475–R477, June 22, 2004. {{doi|10.1016/j.cub.2004.06.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orientation by the sun ===
{{main article|Sun compass in animals}}

[[File:Talitrus saltator 2c.jpg|thumb|The sandhopper, ''[[Talitrus saltator]]'', uses the sun and its [[Circadian rhythm|internal clock]] to determine direction.]]
Some animals can navigate using celestial cues such as the position of the sun. Since the sun moves in the sky, navigation by this means also requires an internal clock. Many animals depend on such a clock to maintain their [[circadian rhythm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dunlap, Jay C.; Loros, Jennifer; DeCoursey, Patricia J. |year=2003 |title=Chronobiology: Biological Timekeeping |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-0878931491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that use sun compass orientation are [[fish]], birds, sea-turtles, [[Butterfly|butterflies]], [[bee]]s, [[sandhopper]]s, [[reptile]]s, and [[ant]]s.&lt;ref name=Alcock140&gt;{{cite book |last=Alcock |first=John |title=Animal Behavior: An Evolutionary Approach |year=2009 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-0-87893-225-2 |pages=140–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[sandhopper]]s (such as ''[[Talitrus saltator]]'') are taken up a beach, they easily find their way back down to the sea. It has been shown that this is not simply by moving downhill or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from the sea, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|p=74}}

Experiments with [[Puffinus puffinus|Manx shearwater]]s showed that when released "under a clear sky" far from their nests, the seabirds first oriented themselves and then flew off in the correct direction. But if the sky was overcast at the time of release, the shearwaters flew around in circles.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|pp=114–117}}

[[Monarch butterfly|Monarch butterflies]] use the sun as a compass to guide their southwesterly autumn migration from Canada to Mexico.&lt;ref name=Alcock140/&gt;

=== Orientation by the night sky ===

In a pioneering experiment, Lockley showed that [[warbler]]s placed in a planetarium showing the night sky oriented themselves towards the south; when the planetarium sky was then very slowly rotated, the birds maintained their orientation with respect to the displayed stars. Lockley observes that to navigate by the stars, birds would need both a "sextant and chronometer": a built-in ability to read patterns of stars and to navigate by them, which also requires an accurate time-of-day clock.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|p=136}}

In 2003, the African [[dung beetle]] ''[[Scarabaeus zambesianus]]'' was shown to navigate using [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] patterns in [[moonlight]], making it the first animal known to use polarized moonlight for orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/424033a| title=Animal behaviour: Insect orientation to polarized moonlight| journal=Nature| volume=424| issue=6944| pages=33| year=2003| last1=Dacke | first1=M. | last2=Nilsson | first2=D.

=== Orientation by polarised light ===
[[File:degpolred.jpg|thumb| [[Rayleigh sky model]] shows how polarization of light can indicate direction to bees.]]
{{main article|Rayleigh sky model}}

Some animals, notably insects such as the [[honey bee]], are sensitive to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. [[Karl von Frisch]]'s work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the [[Beehive|hive]] to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a [[waggle dance]]. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction,{{sfn|von Frisch|1953|pp=93–96}} though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Grüter | first1=C. | last2=Balbuena | first2=M.| last3=Farina | first3=W. | title=Informational conflicts created by the waggle dance  | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B | year=2008 | volume=275 | issue=1640 | pages=1321–1327 | pmc=2602683 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0186 | pmid=18331980}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when polarised light may be used).{{sfn|von Frisch|1953|pp=93–96}}

=== Magnetoreception===
[[File:Homing pigeon.jpg|thumb|The [[homing pigeon]] can quickly return to its home, using cues such as the earth's magnetic field to orient itself.]]
{{main article|Magnetoreception}}

Some animals, including mammals such as blind mole rats (''[[Spalax]]'') &lt;ref name=Kimchi&gt;Kimchi, Tali; Etienne, Ariane S.; Terkel, Joseph (2004). [http://www.pnas.org/content/101/4/1105.full.pdf A subterranean mammal uses the magnetic compass for path integration.]  PNAS, 27 January, vol. 101, no. 4, 1105–1109.&lt;/ref&gt; and birds such as pigeons, are sensitive to the earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lindauer and H. Martin, in S.R. Galler et al. ''Animal Orientation and Navigation'' 559/1, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Homing pigeons use magnetic field information with other navigational cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1996 |author=Walcott, C. |title=Pigeon homing: Observations, experiments and confusions |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |issue=1 |pages=21–27 |pmid=9317262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons could not orient themselves correctly on a clear sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day, suggesting that the birds prefer to rely on the direction of the sun, but switch to using a magnetic field cue when the sun is not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons could not orient correctly on an overcast day when the magnetic field was disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Keeton | first1=W. T. | year=1971 | title=Magnets interfere with pigeon homing | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=68 | issue=1 | pages=102–6 | pmc=391171 | pmid=5276278 | doi=10.1073/pnas.68.1.102 | bibcode=1971PNAS...68..102K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Olfaction ===

[[File:Salmon leaping at the Falls of Shin, Scotland.jpg|thumb|upright|Returning [[salmon]] may use [[olfaction]] to identify the river in which they developed.]]

[[Olfactory navigation]] has been suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the [[odours]] in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour.&lt;ref name=papi90&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ioalè |first=P. |author2=Nozzolini, M. |author3=Papi, F. |year=1990 |title=Homing pigeons do extract directional information from olfactory stimuli |journal=Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=301–305 |doi=10.1007/bf00171094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues that there is a steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However it is not clear that such stable gradients exist.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff, H.G. (1974). ''Das Navigationssystem der Vögel. Ein theoretischer Beitrag zur Analyse ungeklärter Orientierungsleistungen.'' Schriftenreihe 'Kybernetik'. München, Wien: R. Oldenbourg Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.&lt;ref name=wil96&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiltschko |first=W. |author2= Wiltschko, R. |year=1996 |title=Magnetic Orientation in Birds |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=29–38|pmid=9317275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olfactory cues may be important in [[salmon]], which are known to return to the exact river where they hatched. Lockley reports experimental evidence that fish such as minnows can accurately tell the difference between the waters of different rivers.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|p=180}} Salmon may use their magnetic sense to navigate to within reach of their river, and then use olfaction to identify the river at close range.&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, K. J.; Lohmann, C. M. F.; Endres, C. S. (2008). [http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/11/1719.full ''The sensory ecology of ocean navigation''] J Exp Biol, 211: 1719–1728.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gravity receptors===
{{see|Gravity gradiometry}}

[[GPS]] tracing studies indicate that gravity anomalies could play a role in homing pigeon navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nicole Blaser |author2=Sergei I.

===Other senses===

Biologists have considered other senses that may contribute to animal navigation. Many marine animals such as seals are capable of [[hydrodynamic reception]], enabling them to track and catch prey such as fish by sensing the disturbances their passage leaves behind in the water.&lt;ref name="S-P 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/jeb.02708 |pmid=17297138 |year=2007 |author1=Schulte-Pelkum |first1=N. |title=Tracking of biogenic hydrodynamic trails in harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=210 |issue=5 |pages=781–7|last2=Wieskotten |first2=S. |last3=Hanke |first3=W. |last4=Dehnhardt |first4=G. |last5=Mauck |first5=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine mammals such as dolphins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Schevill | first1=W. E. | last2=McBride | first2=A. F. | year=1956 | title=Evidence for echolocation by cetaceans |  journal=Deep-Sea Research | volume=3 | issue=2| pages=153–154 | doi=10.1016/0146-6313(56)90096-x | bibcode=1956DSR.....3..153S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and many species of bat,&lt;ref name=GriffinNYT/&gt; are capable of [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]], which they use both for detecting prey and for orientation by sensing their environment.

===Way-marking===

The [[wood mouse]] is the first non-human animal to be observed, both in the wild and under laboratory conditions, using movable landmarks to navigate. While foraging, they pick up and distribute visually conspicuous objects, such as leaves and twigs, which they then use as landmarks during exploration, moving the markers when the area has been explored.&lt;ref name="Stopka Macdonald 2003 p=3"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stopka | first=Pavel | last2=Macdonald | first2=David W. | title=Way-marking behaviour: an aid to spatial navigation in the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) | journal=BMC Ecology | volume=3 | issue=1 | year=2003 | doi=10.1186/1472-6785-3-3 | page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Path integration ==
[[File:Path integration diagram.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5&lt;!--width for readable text--&gt;|[[Path integration]] sums the [[Vector (mathematics)|vector]]s of distance and direction travelled from a start point to estimate current position, and so the path back to the start.]]
{{main article|Path integration}}

[[Dead reckoning]], in animals usually known as [[path integration]], means the putting together of cues from different sensory sources within the body, without reference to [[Visual perception|visual]] or other external landmarks, to estimate position relative to a known starting point continuously while travelling on a path that is not necessarily straight. Seen as a problem in geometry, the task is to compute the [[vector (mathematics)|vector]] to a starting point by adding the vectors for each leg of the journey from that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animalbehavioronline.com/pathintegration.html | title=Path Integration | publisher=Animal Behavior Online | year=2001 | accessdate=10 December 2012 | author=Breed, Michael D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''On the Origins of Certain Instincts''&lt;ref name="DarwinNature"/&gt; (quoted above) in 1873, path integration has been shown to be important to navigation in animals including ants, rodents and birds.&lt;ref&gt;Gallistel. The Organization of Learning. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Whishaw | first1=I.Q. | last2=Hines | first2=D.J. | last3=Wallace | first3=D.G. | year=2001 | title=Dead reckoning (path integration) requires the hippocampal formation: evidence from spontaneous exploration and spatial learning tasks in light (allothetic) and dark (idiothetic) tests | url=http://hsinnamon.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/NSB-Psyc255/Readings/17.%20Spatial%20Limbic%20System/Whishaw.pdf | format=PDF | journal=Behavioural Brain Research | volume=127 | issue=1–2| pages=49–69 | doi=10.1016/s0166-4328(01)00359-x | pmid=11718884}}&lt;/ref&gt; When vision (and hence the use of remembered landmarks) is not available, such as when animals are navigating on a cloudy night, in the open ocean, or in relatively featureless areas such as sandy deserts, path integration must rely on ''[[idiothetic]]'' cues from within the body.&lt;ref&gt;Mittelstaedt, H.; Mittelstaedt, M.-L. (1973). ''Mechanismen der orientierung ohne richtende aussenreize''. Forschr. Zool., 21:46–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mittelstaedt | first1=M.-L. | last2=Mittelstaedt | first2=H. | year=1980 | title=Homing by path integration in a mammal | url=| journal=Naturwissenschaften | volume=67 | issue=11| pages=566–567 | doi=10.1007/bf00450672| bibcode=1980NW.....67..566M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by Wehner in the [[Sahara desert ant]] (''Cataglyphis bicolor'') demonstrate effective path integration to determine directional heading (by polarized light or sun position) and to compute distance (by monitoring leg movement or optical flow).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Desert ant navigation: how miniature brains solve complex tasks |author=Wehner R | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology |year=2003 |volume=189 |issue=8 |pages=579–588 |url=http://www.zool.uzh.ch/static/research/nb_wehner/literatur/pdf03/wehner20038.pdf | doi=10.1007/s00359-003-0431-1 | pmid=12879352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Path integration in mammals makes use of the [[vestibular organs]], which detect accelerations in the three [[dimension]]s, together with [[Efference copy|motor efference]], where the motor system tells the rest of the brain which movements were commanded,&lt;ref name=Kimchi/&gt; and [[optic flow]], where the visual system signals how fast the visual world moves past the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Perception of the Visual World | author=Gibson, J.J.| publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year=1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information from other senses such as echolocation and magnetoreception may also be integrated in certain animals. The [[hippocampus]] is the part of the brain that integrates linear and angular motion to encode a mammal's relative position in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Path integration and the neural basis of the 'cognitive map' |author1=McNaughton, BL |author2=Battaglia FP |author3=Jensen O |author4=Moser EI |author5=Moser MB | journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |date=August 2006 | volume=7 | issue=8 | pages=663–678 | pmid=16858394 | doi=10.1038/nrn1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Redish states that "The carefully controlled experiments of Mittelstaedt and Mittelstaedt (1980) and Etienne (1987) have demonstrated conclusively that [path integration in mammals] is a consequence of integrating internal cues from vestibular signals and motor efferent copy".{{sfn|Redish|1999|p=67}}

==Effects of human activity==

[[Neonicotinoid]] pesticides may impair the ability of bees to navigate. Bees exposed to low levels of [[thiamethoxam]] were less likely to return to their colony, to an extent sufficient to compromise a colony's survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17535769 | title=BBC News: Science &amp; Environment | publisher=BBC | work=Pesticides hit queen bee numbers | date=29 March 2012 | accessdate=30 March 2012 | author=Black, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Light pollution]] attracts and disorients photophilic animals, those that follow light.  For example, hatchling sea turtles follow bright light, particularly bluish light, altering their navigation. Disrupted navigation in moths can easily be observed around bright lamps on summer nights.  Insects gather around these lamps at high densities instead of navigating naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Behavioral Approaches to Conservation in the Wild | publisher=Cambridge University Press | authors=Witherington, Blair E. in Clemmons, Janine Rhea, and Buchholz, Richard (editors)| year=1997 | pages=301–328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9802">'''Art destruction''' involves the damaging or destruction of works of [[art]]. This can happen through a natural process, an accident, or deliberate human involvement.

==Natural destruction==
All physical works of art are slowly affected and degraded by the natural elements. Some may survive long enough to allow the slow processes of erosion to act on them. Works of art may also be destroyed by natural disasters.

*The [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] is slowly eroding. Most experts believe it is a natural process, but some believe acid rain is accelerating the process.
*It is estimated that tens of thousands of works of [[Japanese art]] dating as far back as the 13th century were destroyed in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] and the ensuing firestorm that destroyed much of central Tokyo.
*1,400 artworks were damaged beyond repair in the November 4, 1966, floods that devastated [[Florence]], Italy, including [[Cimabue]]'s ''[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|The Crucifixion]]''.
*[[Ribeira Palace]] destroyed during [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]]. Inside, the 70,000-volume royal library as well as hundreds of works of art, including paintings by Titian, Rubens, and Correggio, were lost. The royal archives disappeared together with detailed historical records of explorations by Vasco da Gama and other early navigators.
*[[Royal Alcazar of Madrid]] was destroyed by fire on the Christmas Eve of 1734 with its gallery (Velázquez, Titian, Rubens, Ribera, and others.)

==Accidental destruction==
{{Main|Accidental damage of art}}
Many works of art have been damaged or destroyed by accident.
* On September 2, 1998, [[Swissair Flight 111]] crashed near [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], Canada, killing 225 people. [[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1963 work ''Le Peintre'' (The Painter) had been loaded on the flight as cargo and was also destroyed.
* In May 2004 a fire destroyed the [[Momart]] warehouse in east London which destroyed more than 50 works by abstract painter [[Patrick Heron]] and works by other artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/27/1085641648774.html?from=storyrhs|title=Art world reels as losses mount|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=28 March 2014|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intentional destruction==
===Of artwork designed to be destroyed===
[[File:Lightmatter burningman.jpg|thumb|300px|Burning Man]]

Many works of visual art are intended by the artist to be temporary. They may be created in media which the artist knows to be temporary, such as sand, or they may be designed specifically to be destroyed. Often the destruction takes place during a ceremony or special event highlighting the destruction. Examples of this type of art include:
*[[Street painting]]
*[[Sand mandala]]
*[[Ice sculpture]]
*[[Sand art and play|Sand castles]]
*Food art or Edible art

Additionally, some artists destroy their own work out of lack of self confidence or to gain a fresh start (the prior art still inside their head).  [[Claude Monet]] with [[Haystacks (Monet)|destroying 30 paintings in the water lilies series]] and other paintings, or the [[John Baldessari]] collective 1953 - 1966 works in a 1970 bonfire were famous examples. An artist also may limit the number and quality variation of his work to make it more scarce, therefore gain a reputation of increasing in later valuations.

Festivals where artwork is destroyed:
*The week-long ''[[Burning Man]]'' festival in the desert of [[Nevada]], which began in 1986 with tens of thousands of participants who must pay a fee to attend, an entire city of art and self-expression is created. The focal point of the festival is a temple designed and built by artists. On the last day of the festival there is a ceremony known as a Temple Burn where the temple goes up in flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://burningman.org/event/art-performance/playa-art/building-the-temple/|title=Building the Temple|work=Burning Man|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Semana Santa]]'' (Easter week) festival in [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]], [[Guatemala]], where designs made out of flowers and colored sawdust are created in the street prior to being trampled by a religious parade.
*The burning of [[Zozobra]] during [[Fiestas de Santa Fe]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], usually during the second week of September.
*The burning of [[falles]] in [[Valencia]], Spain.

===Of artwork not designed to be destroyed===
Other works of art may be destroyed without the consent of the original artist or of the local community. In other instances, works of art may destroyed by a local authority against the wishes of the outside community. Examples of this include the removal of [[Diego Rivera]]'s ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'' mural from the [[Rockefeller Center]] and the destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] statues by the [[Taliban]] government.
More than 14 Gustav Klimt masterpieces burned in a fire set by retreating SS forces at [[Immendorf Castle]] in May 1945

*[[Iconoclasm]] is the general destruction of a type of work of art for religious or ideological reasons. Most publicly visible [[classical art]] showing religious subjects was destroyed or disfigured by Christians, {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} mostly after theirs had become the state religion. The same process was inflicted on classical and pagan art after the [[Muslim conquests]], a process which continued for centuries, especially in India. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}
*The [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] was an internal process within the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], led by changes of [[Byzantine Emperor]], which was reversed after nearly a century.
*In the [[Protestant Reformation]], a great deal of Medieval and Renaissance religious art was destroyed in Protestant areas, mostly in orderly official removals, but sometimes in riotous attacks, of which the most notable was the [[Beeldenstorm]] which swept the [[Low Countries]] in the summer of 1566 kicking off the [[Dutch Revolt]]. 
*The [[French Revolution]] ushered in a period of widespread art destruction, motivated by anti religious and anti royalist ideology, both in France itself and other countries conquered in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Similar destruction occurred for similar ideological motives following other revolutions such as the [[Paris Commune]], the [[Russian revolution|Russian Revolution]], the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]], and the wars that sometimes followed them. 
*In the 1930s and 1940s, [[Nazi Germany]] destroyed works of art they labeled "[[degenerate art]]". These were often non-realistic forms of art such as [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Art created by [[Secular Jewish culture#Visual arts|Jewish artists]] was also destroyed.
*Tens of thousands of works of art were destroyed in military actions in [[World War II]]. One of the best-known examples in Europe is [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet's]] ''[[The Stone Breakers]]'', which was destroyed in [[Dresden]] in 1945 during the Allied bombings. The original of [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'', a work with an iconic status in the US, was destroyed in a British bombing of [[Bremen]]. Other works of art were destroyed in [[the Blitz]], in the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombings]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], and throughout [[Southeast Asia]].
*Artworks destroyed in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]] in the United States included a painted wood relief by [[Louise Nevelson]], a painting from [[Roy Lichtenstein]]'s ''Entablature'' series and a [[Joan Miró]] tapestry. The total value of artwork lost in the September 11 attacks is said to have been in excess of $100 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1581737.stm|title='Up to' $100m art lost in attacks|date=5 October 2001|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Corridart]] was an eight-kilometer exhibit of artworks in [[Montreal]], intended to be part of the arts and cultural component of the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]. Mayor [[Jean Drapeau]], who deemed the artworks ugly, had them torn down two days before the Olympic games began.
*In 1956, a vandal [[Mona Lisa#Theft and vandalism|threw acid at the Louvre museum's Mona Lisa]], damaging it.

In cell biology, the '''cleavage furrow''' is the indentation of the cell's surface that begins the progression of cleavage, by which animal and some algal cells undergo [[cytokinesis]], the final splitting of the membrane, in the process of [[cell division]]. The same proteins responsible for muscle contraction, [[actin]] and [[myosin]], begin the process of forming the cleavage furrow, creating an [[actomyosin ring]].  Other [[cytoskeletal]] proteins and actin binding proteins are involved in the procedure.

== Mechanism ==
Plant cells do not perform cytokinesis through this exact method but the two procedures are not totally different. Animal cells form an actin-myosin [[contractile ring]] within the equatorial region of the [[cell membrane]] that constricts to form the cleavage furrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cao LG, Wang YL |title=Mechanism of the formation of contractile ring in dividing cultured animal cells.

== Cell cycle ==
The [[cell cycle]] begins with [[interphase]] when the DNA replicates, the cell grows and prepares to enter mitosis. [[Mitosis]] includes four phases, [[prophase]], [[metaphase]], [[anaphase]], and [[telophase]]. Prophase is the initial phase when [[spindle fibers]] appear that function to move the [[chromosomes]] toward opposite poles. This spindle apparatus consists of microtubules, microfilaments and a complex network of various proteins. During metaphase, the chromosomes line up using the spindle apparatus in the middle of the cell along the equatorial plate.  The chromosomes move to opposite poles during anaphase and remain attached to the spindle fibers by their centromeres. Animal cell cleavage furrow formation is caused by a ring of actin microfilaments called the contractile ring, which forms during early anaphase. Myosin is present in the region of the contractile ring as concentrated microfilaments and actin filaments are predominant in this region.  The actin filaments here are both pre-existing and new. Cleavage is driven by these [[motor proteins]], actin and myosin, which are the same proteins involved with muscle contraction. During cellular cleavage, the contractile ring tightens around the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell until the cytoplasm is pinched into two daughter cells. During the final phase of mitosis, telophase, the furrow forms an intercellular bridge using [[mitotic spindle]] fibers. [[Phosphatidylethanolamine]] (PE) has been shown to be present during this time which indicates that is may play a role in movement between the plasma membrane and contractile ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Emoto K, Kobayashi T, Yamaji A |title=Redistribution of phosphatidylethanolamine at the cleavage furrow of dividing cells during cytokinesis |journal=Proc.

The breakage is formed by microtubules and the resealing is negated by [[exocytosis|Calcium dependent exocytosis]] using Golgi vesicles.&lt;ref name=Skop01/&gt; In comparison, the plant cell septum and the animal cell mid-zone are analogous. Both require vesicular secretions by the Golgi apparatus for resealing and formation of the cytoskeletal network in addition to microtubules and microfilaments for division and movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Togo T, Alderton JM, Bi GQ, Steinhardt RA |title=The mechanism of facilitated cell membrane resealing |journal=J.

'''Consumer capitalism''' is a theoretical economic and social political condition in which  [[demand|consumer demand]] is manipulated, in a deliberate and coordinated way, on a very large scale, through [[mass-marketing]] techniques, to the advantage of sellers.

This theory is controversial.  It suggests manipulation of consumer demand so potent that it has a [[coercion|coercive]] effect, amounts to a departure from [[free-market capitalism]], and has an adverse effect on society in general. According to one source, the power of such 'manipulation' is not straightforward. It depends upon a new kind of individualism - ''projective individualism'', where persons use consumer capitalism to project the kind of person who they want to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2012 | last1= James | first1= Paul | last2= Scerri | first2= Andy | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalizing Consumption and the Deferral of a Politics of Consequence | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230921/Globalizing_Consumption_and_the_Deferral_of_a_Politics_of_Consequence | journal= Globalizations | volume= 9 | issue= 2 | pages= 225–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some use the phrase as shorthand for the broader idea that the interests of other non-business entities (governments, religions, the military, educational institutions) are intertwined with corporate business interests, and that those entities also participate in the management of social expectations through mass media.

== Origins ==

The origins of consumer capitalism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silla|first=Cesare|title=The Rise of Consumer Capitalism in America, 1880-1930|year=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=London-New York|url= https://books.google.it/books?id=oqVYDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1&amp;lpg=PT1&amp;dq=the+rise+of+consumer+capitalism+in+america&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZbDa8RGHMV&amp;sig=QfS3VAuSNLwfU2eXMH2wi4pKB2U&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf2cWsw_3aAhUrKpoKHTzvDRcQ6AEIUDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20rise%20of%20consumer%20capitalism%20in%20america&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; are found in the development of American [[department store]]s from the mid 19th Century, notably the advertising and marketing innovations at [[Wanamaker's]] in [[Philadelphia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Author William Leach describes a deliberate, coordinated effort among American '[[Captain of industry|captains of industry]]' to detach consumer demand from 'needs' (which can be satisfied) to 'wants' (which may remain unsatisfied).  This cultural shift represented by the department store is also explored in [[Émile Zola]]'s 1883 novel ''[[Au Bonheur des Dames]]'', which describes the workings and the appeal of a fictionalized version of [[Le Bon Marché]].

In 1919 [[Edward Bernays]] began his career as the 'father of [[public relations]]' and successfully applied the developing principles of psychology, sociology and motivational research to manipulate public opinion in favor of products like cigarettes, soap, and [[Calvin Coolidge]].  New techniques of mechanical reproduction developed in these decades improved the channels of mass-market communication and its manipulative power.  This development was described as early as the 1920s by [[Walter Benjamin]] and related members of the [[Frankfurt School]], who foresaw the commercial, societal and political implications.

In business history, the mid-1920s saw [[Alfred P. Sloan]] stimulating increased demand for [[General Motors]] products by instituting the annual model year change and [[planned obsolescence]], a move that changed the dynamics of the largest industrial enterprise in the world, away from technological innovation and towards satisfying market expectations.

Probably the most obvious example of consumer capital tactics in the United States' history occurred during the first world war.  During which the United States' government put out several campaigns and advertisements aimed to gain support for engaging in the war. At this time the government's involvement in the economy was known as propaganda.  Advertisements, posters and campaigns were found everywhere, encouraging the public to add to the economy and consume more.  Many of these public attempts encouraged mass consumption of domestic food to help put back into the economy and support the war. and  In her book, Celia Malone Kingsbury even discusses how during the war the government manipulated the economy in such a way that the consumption of domestic food was made into a "powerful weapon."&lt;ref&gt;Kingsbury, Celia Malone. For Home and Country: World War I Propaganda on the Home Front. Lincoln: University of Nebraska, 2010. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt; The government manipulated the public by turning commercialism into a sort of nationalism, pride and support of one's country.

== Criticism ==
An important contribution to the critique of consumer capitalism has been made by the French philosopher [[Bernard Stiegler]], but very little of this has been translated into English. Stiegler argues that capitalism today is governed not by production but by consumption, and that the techniques used to create consumer behavior amount to the destruction of psychic and collective [[individuation]]. The diversion of libidinal energy toward the consumption of consumer products, he argues, results in an addictive cycle, leading to hyperconsumption, the exhaustion of desire, and the reign of symbolic misery.&lt;ref&gt;Stiegler discusses consumer capitalism in his article [http://www.arsindustrialis.org/disaffected-individual-process-psychic-and-collective-disindividuation The Disaffected Individual]. His response to the situation can be discerned by reading the [http://www.arsindustrialis.org/manifeste/index_html-en?set_language=en&amp;cl=en manifesto] of his political group, [http://www.arsindustrialis.org/ Ars Industrialis].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer capitalism today==

In light of the economic hardships the United States is today experiencing as a result of radical wealth inequalities, and perhaps a strong dependence on oil, consumer capitalist tactics have turned to credit as a means to maintaining a high level of expenditures in the form of consumer demand. Some of these tactics, to cite one extremely peripheral example, include government incentives to buy eco-friendly 'green' products, such as tax deductions for energy conserving home improvements or the purchasing of hybrid cars. These tactics, however, are not without critics. James Gustave Speth, former dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and author of ''The Bridge at the Edge of the World: Capitalism, the Environment, and Crossing from Crisis to Sustainability,'' does not believe the United States government should implement such tactics. Instead Gustave believes in more direct approaches to repair or avoid environmental damage. Rather than focusing on re-boosting the distressed economy, treat the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Speth, James G. The Bridge at the Edge of the World: Capitalism, the Environment, and Crossing from Crisis to Sustainability. Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies - Masters of Environmental Management. Web. 27 Feb. 2011. &lt; http://environment.yale.edu/news/5647/ &gt;.

{{hatnote|1=CRID redirects here. CRID may also refer to a current rail indicator device, a safety device indicating the presence of [[third rail]] power, or to a [[Ring-imaging Cherenkov detector|Cherenkov Ring-Imaging Detector]]}}

== Overview ==
A '''content reference identifier''' or '''CRID''' is a concept from the standardization work done by the [[TV-Anytime]] forum. It is or closely matches the concept of the [[Uniform Resource Locator]], or URL, as used on the [[World-Wide Web]]:

{{Quotation|A unit of content, in a [[Broadcasting|broadcast stream]], can be referred to by its globally unique CRID in the same way that a [[webpage]] can be referred to by its globally unique URL on the web.}}&lt;!--source? or is it not a quotation?--&gt;

The concept of CRID permits to reference contents unambiguously, regardless of their location, i.e., without knowing specific broadcast information (time, date and channel) or how to obtain them through a network, for instance, by means of a streaming service or by downloading a file from an Internet server.

The receiver must be capable of resolving these unambiguous references, i.e., translate them into specific data that will allow it to obtain the location of that content in order to acquire it. This makes it possible for recording processes to take place without knowing that information, and even without knowing beforehand the duration of the content to be recorded: a complete series by a simple click, a program that has not been scheduled yet, a set of programs grouped by a specific criterion…

This framework allows for the separation between the reference to a given content (the CRID) and the necessary information to acquire it, which is called a “locator”. Each CRID may lead to one or more locators which will represent different copies of the same content. They may be identical copies broadcast in different channels or dates, or cost different prices. They may also be distinct copies with different technical parameters such as format or quality.

It may also be the case that the resolution process of a CRID provides another CRID as a result (for example, its reference in a different network, where it has an alternative identifier assigned by a different operator) or a set of CRIDs (for instance, if the original CRID represents a TV series, in which case the resolution process would result in the list of CRIDs representing each episode).
 
From the above it can be concluded that provided that a given content can belong to many groups (each possibly defined by distinctive qualities), it is possible that many CRIDs carry the same content. That is, several CRIDs may be resolved into the same locator.

A CRID is not exactly a universal, unique and exclusive identifier for a given content. It is closely related to the authority that creates it, to the resolution service provider, and to the content provider in such a way that the same content may have different CRIDs depending on the field in which they are used (for example, a different one for each television operator that has the rights to broadcast the content).

== Format ==
A CRID is specified much like URLs. In fact, a CRID is a so-called [[uniform resource identifier|URI]]. Typically, the content creator, the broadcaster or a third party will use their [[domain name system|DNS]]-names in a combination with a product-specific name to create globally unique CRIDs. That is, the syntax of a CRID is:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=xml&gt;
 crid://authority/data
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The ''authority'' field represents the entity that created the CRID and its format is that of a DNS name. The ''data'' field represents a string of characters that will unambiguously identify the content within the authority scope (it is a string of characters assigned by the authority itself).

As an example, let's assume that [[BBC]] wanted to make a CRID for (all the programs of) the Olympics in China. It may have looked something like this
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=xml&gt;
 crid://bbc.co.uk/olympics/2008/
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
This would be a group CRID, that is, a CRID representing a group of contents. Then, to refer to a specific event – such as the women's shot-put final – they could have used the following inside their metadata.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=xml&gt;
 crid://bbc.co.uk/olympics/2008/final/shotput/women
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Currently,{{When|date=January 2013}} four types of CRIDs are playing a major role in some [[Unidirectional networks|unidirectional]] television networks: programme CRID, series CRID, group CRID, and recommendation CRID. One of the most important applications of CRIDs is the so-called series link recording function (SL) of modern digital video recorders ([[Digital video recorder|DVR]], [[Personal video recorder|PVR]]).

In turn, a locator is a string of characters that contains all the necessary information for a receiver to find and acquire a given content, whether it is received through a transport stream, located in local storage, downloaded as a file from an Internet server, or through a streaming service. For example, a DVB locator will include all the necessary parameters to identify a specific content within a transport stream: network, transport stream, service, table and/or event identifiers.

The locators' format, as established in TV-Anytime, is quite generic and simple, and corresponds to:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=xml&gt;
 [transport-mechanism]:[specific-data]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The first part of the locator’s format (the transport mechanism) must be a string of characters that is unique for each mechanism (transport stream, local file, HTTP Internet access…). The second part must be unambiguous only within the scope of a given transport mechanism and will be standardized by the organism in charge of the regulation of the mechanism itself. 
For instance, a DVB locator to identify a content within the transport stream of networks that follow this standard would be:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=xml&gt;
 dvb://112.4a2.5ec;2d22~20121212T220000Z—PT01H30M
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
which would indicate a content (identified by the string “2d22”) that airs on a channel available on a DVB network identified by the address “112.4a2.5ec” (network “112”, transport stream “4a2” and service “5ec”), on 12 December 2012 at 10 p.m. and with a duration of 90 minutes.

== The location resolution process ==

The location resolution process is the procedure by which, starting from the CRID of a given content, one or several locators of that content are obtained. Resolving a CRID can be a direct process, which leads immediately to one or many locators, or it may also happen that in the first place one or many intermediate CRIDs are returned, which must undergo the same procedure to finally obtain one or several locators.

This procedure involves some information elements, among which we find two structures named resolving authority record (RAR) and ContentReferencingTable, respectively. Consulting them repeatedly will take the receiver from a CRID to one or many locators that will allow it to acquire the content.

'''The RAR table'''

The RAR table is one or many data structures that provide the receiver, for each authority that submits CRIDs, information on the corresponding resolution service provider. Among other things, it informs about which mechanism is used to provide information to resolve the CRIDs from each authority. That is, one or many RAR records must exist for each authority that indicate the receiver where it has to go to resolve the CRIDs of that particular authority.

For example, in the record of the figure (expressed by means of a XML structure, according to the XML Schema defined in the TV-Anytime) there is an authority called “tve.es”, whose resolution service provider is the entity “rtve.es”, available on the URL &lt;nowiki&gt;"http://tva.rtve.es/locres/tve"&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which means there is resolution information in that URL.

[[File:RAR record example.png|center|RAR table in XML format]]

These RAR records will have reached the receiver in an indefinite form, unimportant for the TV-Anytime specification, which will depend on the specific transport mechanism of the network to which the receiver is connected. Each family of standards that regulates distribution networks (DVB, ATSC, ISDB, IPTV...) will have previously defined such procedure, which will be used by devices certified according to those standards.

'''The ContentReferencingTable table'''

The second structure involved in the location resolution process is a proper resolution table which, given a content's CRID, returns one or several locators that enable the receiver to access an instance of that content, or one or many CRIDs that allow it to move forward in the resolution process.

The figure shows an example of this second structure, an XML document according to the specifications of the XML Schema defined in TV-Anytime. In it, several sections are included (&lt;Result&gt; elements) that structure the information that describes each resolution case.

[[File:ContentReferencingTable.png|center|an example of a ContentReferencingTable]]

The first one declares how a CRID (crid://tv.com/Friends/all), which corresponds to a group content that encompasses several episodes (two) of the “Friends” series is resolved. The result of the resolution process provides two new CRIDs each of them corresponding to one of the two episodes.

The second &lt;Result&gt; element resolves the CRID of the first episode of the first season. The result of the resolution process is two DVB locators. The “acquire” attribute with “any” value indicates that any of them are good (the second one is a repetition broadcast a week later).

The third &lt;Result&gt; element gives information about the second episode. It indicates that it cannot be resolved yet (“status” attribute with the “cannot yet resolve” value), indicating a date on which the request for resolution information must be repeated.

'''The process'''

Once the user has selected a given content (identified by the corresponding CRID) to perform some action upon it, the receiver begins the location resolution process that shall lead to specific location information that allows access to a copy of the content.

This procedure depends mainly on the receiver’s connectivity. It is possible to make a basic distinction between unidirectional networks, where the receiver can only receive information through the broadcast channel, and bidirectional networks, where there is also a return channel through which the receiver can communicate with the outside (typically an Internet access).

For receivers connected only to a broadcast channel, it is clear that the resolution information must come directly from that channel, or be available somehow in an existing local storage system. After selecting a CRID, the first thing the receiver needs to do is check the information about where to find the resolution table. For this, it must find a RAR record associated with the authority of the selected CRID.

Once a RAR record corresponding to that authority is found, the receiver will know, by referring to the URL field, where to access (or, in this case, where to listen) to obtain the resolution information.

The information that will receive through that access point will consist of a message for each of the consulted CRIDs (for example, a &lt;Result&gt; element in the ContentReferencingTable).

== In web casting ==
To make the CRID even more globally available the [[IETF]] will publish a request for comments specifying the use of the CRID over the web. This will allow consumer devices to hook up to content provider servers, much like current browsers look up webservers, requesting content by CRID.

In May 2005, an Informational RFC, [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4078 No 4078], was published as the start of this work.

The long-term goal is that CRIDs should be available for use by [[cell phones]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, [[Digital television|digital TV]] [[Set-top box|receivers]] and other [[Consumer electronics|consumer devices]] for fetching content, either from a broadcast stream or over [[internet protocol|IP]]-based [[computer network|networks]].

A '''culm''' is the aerial (above-ground) stem of a [[grass]] or [[sedge]]. It is derived from {{wikt-lang|la|culmus}}, the Latin word for "stalk", and it originally referred to the [[plant stem|stem]] of any type of [[plant]].&lt;ref&gt;MacGillavray, William ''A Manual of Botany'' London 1840. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malting==
In the production of malted grains the culms refer to the rootlets of the germinated grains. The culms are normally removed in a process known as "deculming" after kilning when producing [[barley]] malt, but form an important part of the product when making [[sorghum]] or [[millet]] malt. These culms are very nutritious and are sold off as animal feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/ag/AGA/AGAP/FRG/AFRIS/Data/467.HTM | title=Malt culms, malt sprouts, malt coombs | publisher=Animal Feed Resources Information System | accessdate=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cumberland University''' is a [[private university]] in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]]. It was founded in 1842, though the current campus buildings were constructed between 1892 and 1896.&lt;ref name=tour&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncountycvb.com/images/tour.pdf |title=Lebanon, Tennessee: A Tour of Our City |format=PDF |publisher=Lebanon/Wilson County Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=February 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615023407/http://www.wilsoncountycvb.com/images/tour.pdf |archivedate=June 15, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Cumberland University-drawing - c.1858.JPG|thumb|right|Drawing of Cumberland University, c.1858]]
[[File:Cumberland University Bulletin (1918) (14778838722).jpg|thumb|right|Memorial Hall, 1918]]
The university was founded by the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]] in 1842 and received its Tennessee State charter in 1843. In 1847 Cumberland Presbyterian church leaders added a [[law school]], the first in Tennessee and the first west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], and in 1854 a school of [[theology]] was begun.

The original building, designed by [[Philadelphia]] [[architect]]  [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]], housed schools of art, law and theology. It was burned by the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=tour/&gt;

Following the war, the university's faculty included former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general [[Alexander P. Stewart|A. P. Stewart]]. He taught there during his post-Civil War [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] parole.&lt;ref name=tour/&gt;

From its early years, Cumberland University maintained a reputation for high-quality education.  The [[Cumberland School of Law]] at one time was said to have had more of its [[alumni]] elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]] than any other in the [[U.S. southern states|South]].

The American Civil War nearly destroyed Cumberland University. University Hall was burned to the ground by Confederate forces under the command of General Joseph Wheeler. A Cumberland student wrote on a ruined [[Corinthian column]] the [[Latin]]  ''Ex Cineribus Resurgam'' (From the ashes I will arise). The university thereafter adopted the mythical [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] bird as its symbol. By 1866, just one year after the war's end, all departments were again operating in various locations in the town of Lebanon. Cumberland University moved to its present campus location in 1892.

The university fell on hard times during the [[Great Depression]], as did most small private colleges. After [[World War II]], Cumberland experienced several changes in sponsorship and programs. In 1946, The [[Tennessee Baptist Convention]] assumed control of the school, ending a century of operation by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church.

In 1951, the Tennessee Baptists closed the College of Arts and Sciences and operated only the School of Law. In 1956, the Board of Trust secured an amendment to the Charter and changed Cumberland to a private, independent corporation. The College of the Arts and Sciences was reopened as a two-year [[junior college]], known as Cumberland College of Tennessee. In 1962, the assets of the School of Law were transferred to Howard College now known as [[Samford University]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].

The Board of Trust expanded the academic programs of the junior college in 1982, returning Cumberland to a four-year, [[academic degree|degree]] institution. It resumed the old name of Cumberland University. Since then, Cumberland has expanded its academic program to include new majors and specialized student-learning opportunities.

Cumberland University believes that a broad education, based in the liberal arts, is the best foundation for a lifetime of learning. Students from every state and from many foreign countries now attend Cumberland. Its alumni include 14 [[Governor (United States)|governors]], more than 80 members of the [[United States Congress]], two [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justices, three [[United States ambassador]]s, and one [[United States Secretary of State]] ([[Cordell Hull]], known as the "father of the [[United Nations]]").

===Cumberland School of Law===
{{main|Cumberland School of Law}}
In 1847 Cumberland Presbyterian church leaders added the [[Cumberland School of Law]], the first [[law school]] in Tennessee and the first west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. For many years the law school was located in historic Caruthers Hall, named for [[Robert L. Caruthers|Robert Looney Caruthers]], a founder of Cumberland University.&lt;ref name=tour/&gt;

The trustees sold the School of Law and its assets in 1962 to what is now [[Samford University]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. The law school continues to operate there.

==Community outreach==
Cumberland University gives back to the local community in many ways. Cumberland has a [[Circle K International|Circle K]] club, which is affiliated with [[Kiwanis International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cumberland.edu/campuslife/studentorgs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527093234/http://www.cumberland.edu/campuslife/studentorgs |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 13, 2010, Cumberland University hosted a conference basketball game, and donated half of its gate admissions to Sherry's Run, a non-profit organization created to benefit people with [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherrysrun.org/archives/621|title=Sherry's Run - To Benefit Those Affected by Cancer - Lebanon, TN|author=|date=|website=www.sherrysrun.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Cumberland University cycling team formed its own chapter of local non-profit organization [[Ride for Reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rideforreading.com/?page_id=133 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416085957/http://www.rideforreading.com/?page_id=133 |archivedate=2010-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek Life ==
The university has 2 sororities and 4 fraternities. The sororities include the Lambda Omicron chapter of [[Alpha Omicron Pi]] and the Delta Mu chapter of [[Alpha Sigma Tau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cumberland.edu/student-life/greeklife/orgs/sororities/home|title=Sororities|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fraternities include the Theta Prime chapter of [[Kappa Sigma]], the Nu chapter of [[Sigma Chi]], the [[Psi Beta Sigma]], and [[Omega Psi Psi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cumberland.edu/student-life/greeklife/orgs/fraternities/home|title=Fraternities|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
[[Image:Cumberland university.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cumberland University]]

Cumberland University teams, nicknamed athletically as the Phoenix, are part of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA), primarily competing in the [[Mid-South Conference]]. The Phoenix formerly competed in the [[TranSouth Athletic Conference]]. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis and wrestling; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball.

{{main|Cumberland Phoenix football}}
Cumberland football began on October 26, 1894 with a 6–6 tie with Peabody and finished that first year with a 2–1–1 season record. The early days of Cumberland football were very promising. The pinnacle of the early days of CU football was the [[1903 Cumberland Bulldogs football team|1903 season]] that began with a (6–0) win over [[1903 Vanderbilt Commodores football team|Vanderbilt]] then a (0–6) loss to [[1903 Sewanee Tigers football team|Sewanee]] and continued with a five-day road trip with victories over [[1903 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] (44–0) November 14, 1903, [[1903 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]] (41–0) November 16, 1903, and [[1903 Tulane Olive and Blue football team|Tulane]] (28–0) November 18, 1903. Cumberland would play a postseason game against Coach [[John Heisman]]'s [[1903 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] team on Thanksgiving Day that ended in an 11–11 tie and a record of 4–1–1 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhowell.net/cf/scores/Cumberland.htm#1903|title=Cumberland Historical Scores|author=|date=|website=www.jhowell.net|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gave Coach A.L. Phillips and Cumberland University the Championship of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~dwilson/rfsc/champs/Southern.txt|title=Champions of the South regardless of conference affiliation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8McdQD3SY00C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;q=%22m%20l%20bridges%22%20cumberland%20football|title=From Maverick to Mainstream: Cumberland School of Law, 1847–1997|author=Langum, David J|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1916 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech football game|1916 game]] against [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] is famous as the most lopsided-scoring game in the history of college football, which was a 0–222 loss for Cumberland University.

Cumberland's baseball program is probably its best-known athletic team, especially those of the 2004, 2010, and 2014 [[baseball]] seasons, which won the World Series of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]]; the 1995 and 2006 teams were runner-up in this event.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In addition, Cumberland achieved a top-ten finish at the National Collegiate Cycling Association's National Championship, its women's basketball team finished as NAIA National Tournament Runner-Up in 2007, and Cumberland achieved a National Tournament appearance for the No. 17-ranked Men's Tennis Team in 2007.  The men's basketball team also earned success in the 2008–2009 basketball season earning another trip to the National Tournament.

Cumberland University's Women's Basketball team won the Mid-South Conference title in 2012–2013 and lost in semi finals of the NAIA national tournament in Frankfort Kentucky

For the 2008 season, CU's football earned a share of the Mid-South Conference West Division.

On August 7, 2013, Cumberland University was granted provisional membership into the [[Great Midwest Athletic Conference]] (G-MAC) after a vote of league presidents, paving the way for the University to apply to the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] for admittance into [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumberland.edu/news/2013/08/07/cu-becomes-provisional-member-of-gmac.660334|title=CU Becomes Provisional Member of GMAC|author=|date=|website=cumberland.edu|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland's application to join Division II was denied in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Division II Admits its 300th Member |url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/division-ii-admits-its-300th-member|publisher=ncaa.org|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2016, Cumberland University changed the nickname of its athletic program from "Bulldogs" to "Phoenix", stating that, "For more than 150 years, the Phoenix has personified the spirit of Cumberland University."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CU athletics launches new nickname|url=http://www.wilsonpost.com/cu-athletics-launches-new-nickname-cms-87098|publisher=The Wilson Post |accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 soccer season for the women's program was a successful one. Head coach, Brian Davies, lead his team to an undefeated winning streak for the regular season. The program made it to the Mid-South Conference finals where they were defeated 1-0 by rival, Lindsay Wilson College.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gocumberlandathletics.com/wsoccer/news/|title=Women's Soccer {{!}} News {{!}} Official Site of the Cumberland University Athletics|last=TN|first=Streamline Technologies {{!}} Nashville,|website=GoCumberlandAthletics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Master in Law &amp; Economics''', also known as EMLE, is an [[Erasmus Mundus]] post-graduate [[master's degree]]. It focuses on "interdisciplinary studies of law and economics" and "an advanced understanding of the economic effects of divergent laws".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emle.org emle.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is offered by a consortium of nine universities: [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] (co-ordinating institution), [[University of Hamburg]], [[University of Bologna]], [[University of Ghent]], [[University of Aix-Marseille]], [[University of Vienna]], [[University of Haifa]], [[Warsaw School of Economics]] and the [[Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research]]. Furthermore, the EMLE maintains a link with the [[University of California, Berkeley]] which allows some students to serve as visiting scholars in residence there.

Students who participate in the EMLE Program usually divide their time between two or three of the participating Universities and, depending on their allocations, can receive multiple-degrees from each institution where they have undertaken studies. The partner universities variously award [[LL.M.]], [[M.Sc.]] or [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degrees. The language of instruction is English, but the master thesis can also be written in another European language.

==History of the programme==

The European Master Programme in Law and Economics started in 1990 at the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Ghent]], [[Paris Dauphine University]], and [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] with 20 students from a variety of countries. From the very beginning, the Programme received recognition and financial support of the ERASMUS Bureau of the European Community. The partner universities exchanged multilateral agreements to continue their joint venture and made all the necessary arrangements in order to be included in the new SOCRATES framework between the European Commission and the European universities. The number of partner universities has increased rapidly and the network now comprises seven teaching centres within the EU and two internationally.

==Admission==

Admission to the EMLE is extremely selective. Applicants must have a bachelor’s or master's degree in law or economics with high academic merit. Degrees from related disciplines are also acceptable, provided that the curriculum comprises a significant number of courses in law or economics. Preference is given to applicants who already have a first masters or above, and most admitted students already hold advanced degrees.  The demand for a place in the programme has steadily risen.  Given the increase in the number of applications, the acceptance rate is now consistently below 10%. While most students still come from within the E.U., over 30 other countries are represented in each class.

==Structure==

The European Master Programme in Law and Economics is the primary source of high quality postgraduate education in the field of the economic analysis of law. The EMLE is designed to provide students with advanced knowledge in the Economic Analysis of Law and to allow them to use economic methods to explain and assess the effects of divergent legal rules. Students study introductory courses and core courses on the major topics in the economic analysis of law.

Students also take specialized courses and write a master thesis. The EMLE includes three kinds of courses: Economic Courses, Comparative Law Courses, and Law and Economics Courses.

Students will become competent to work for private companies, public organizations, as economic advisers, or for large multinational law firms. Graduates are also well prepared for research in Law and Economics. Many EMLE graduates now hold teaching positions in European universities.

==Reputation and accreditation==

The EMLE has been recognized as an Erasmus Mundus Masters Course by a panel of independent academic experts and chosen by the Selection Committee out of 128 proposals.{{cn|date=November 2017}} The European Commission has designated the programme of "outstanding academic quality."{{cn|date=November 2017}} The Master in Law and Economics is the only Masters Course in Economics and one of the two Erasmus Mundus Courses in the legal discipline. In 2002, the EMLE Programme was already selected to take part in the Joint Masters Project of the European University Association (together with 10 other networks). In August 2004, the EMLE program in Rotterdam and Ghent was accredited by the NVAO, the [[Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders]]. Also in 2004, The EMLE was also included in the list of the eleven best European Joint Masters by the EUA. In February 2005, the EMLE was accredited by ZEvA, the German Central Evaluation and Accreditation Agency. The EMLE has participated in the TEEP II Project, which is a form of external quality assurance and The TEEP II Committee showed a very high appreciation of the EMLE. The Israeli economic newspaper [[Haaretz]] classified the EMLE programme as "the most elitist integrated Master program"&lt;ref&gt;''Haaretz'', 22 August 2010, Amit Ben - Aroya, "בבוקר משפט מסחרי, בערב שיטוט בפאריס", http://www.themarker.com/law/1.578905&lt;/ref&gt; for law and economics.

==Governance==

The EMLE is organized and governed by Associated Members and a Committee of Patronage, which is composed of public and private research institutions, governmental bodies, law firms and consulting firms, commercial enterprises, and renowned scholars in law and economics.

Associated Members include: [[Deutsche Bundesbank]], [[Deutsche Bank AG]], [[De Nederlandsche Bank]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[Deloitte]], [[White &amp; Case LLP]], [[Covington &amp; Burling LLP]], [[Centre for European Policy Studies]], European Association of Law and Economics, [[RiskMetrics]] Group, Joseph von Sonnenfels Center for the Study of Public Law and Economics, [[Bombay Stock Exchange Limited]], and many other notable institutions.

The Committee of Patronage includes world-leading Professors: [[James M. Buchanan]] ([[Nobel Prize]] Award 1985), [[Ronald Coase]] ([[Nobel Prize]] Award 1991), [[Robert Cooter]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), R. Epstein ([[University of Chicago]]), Michael Faure ([[University of Maastricht]]), [[William Landes]] ([[University of Chicago]]), [[Ejan Mackaay]] ([[University of Montréal]]), [[Henry Manne]] (former Dean - [[George Mason University Law School]]), A. Mitchell Polinsky ([[Stanford Law School]]), [[Richard Posner]] ([[University of Chicago]], Chief Judge [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]]), Susan Rose-Ackerman ([[Yale Law School]]), Steven Shavell ([[Harvard Law School]]), Cento Veljanovski (Research &amp; Editorial Director of the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], London), [[Oliver E. Williamson]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), and O. Zerbe, Jr. ([[University of Washington]]).

==The Midterm Meeting==

The first Midterm Meeting of the EMLE took place in Ghent in 1991. Since then the Midterm Meeting of EMLE has grown to be a multi-facetted event, a symposium of lectures and scientific discussion seminars, informal networking and other social activities. This annual event now rotates between Bologna, Ghent and Hamburg, and also serves as the forum for the EMLE graduation ceremonies. The EMLE Midterm Meeting attracts one of the largest groups of Law and Economics scholars in the world and is widely regarded as one of the leading conferences for law and economics.

According to the book's preface, Factory Physics is "a systematic description of the underlying behavior of [[Operations_management#Production_systems|manufacturing systems]].  Understanding it enables managers and engineers to work with the natural tendencies of manufacturing systems to:

# Identify opportunities for improving existing systems.
# Design effective new systems.
# Make the [[trade-off]]s needed to coordinate policies from disparate areas.

The book is used both in industry and in academia for reference and teaching on [[operations management]]. It describes a new approach to manufacturing management based on the laws of Factory Physics science. The fundamental Factory Physics framework states that the essential components of all value streams or production processes or service processes are demand and transformation which are described by structural elements of flows and stocks. There are very specific practical, [[mathematical]] relationships that enable one to describe and control the performance of flows and stocks. The book states that, in the presence of [[Statistical variability|variability]], there are only three buffers available to synchronize [[demand]] and transformation with lowest [[cost]] and highest [[service level]]:

*[[Capacity utilization|capacity]]
*[[inventory]]
*response time.

The book states that its approach enables practical, predictive understanding of flows and stocks and how to best use the three levers to optimally synchronize demand and transformation.

This work won the 1996 [[Institute of Industrial Engineers]] IIE/Joint Publishers Book of the Year Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iienet2.org/awards.aspx?id=10802&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fluency''' (also called '''volubility''' and '''eloquency''') is the property of a [[person]] or of a [[system]] that delivers [[information]] quickly and with [[expertise]].

== Language use ==
{{further|Language proficiency}}Language fluency is one of a variety of terms used to characterize or measure a person's language ability,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Bilingual Education|last=González|first=Josué M.|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2008|isbn=9781412937207|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=673}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used in conjunction with accuracy and complexity.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58970182|title=Analysing learner language|author=Ellis, Rod|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Barkhuizen, Gary Patrick.|isbn=0194316343|location=Oxford|oclc=58970182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no widely agreed-upon definitions or measures of language fluency,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=Francine|title=What do we mean by fluency?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0346-251X(97)00046-8|journal=System|volume=25|issue=4|pages=535–544|doi=10.1016/s0346-251x(97)00046-8|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt; someone is typically said to be fluent if their use of the [[language]] appears ''fluid'', or natural, coherent, and easy as opposed to slow, halting use.&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; In other words, fluency is often described as the ability to [[Language production|produce language]] on demand and be understood.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

Varying definitions of fluency characterize it by the language user’s automaticity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=R.|date=1992|title=Psychological mechanisms underlying second language fluency|url=|journal=Studies in Second Language Acquisition|volume=14|pages=357–385|via=|doi=10.1017/s0272263100011189}}&lt;/ref&gt; their speed and coherency of language use,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual differences in language ability and language behavior|last=Fillmore|first=C. J.|publisher=Academic Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=85–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the length and rate of their speech output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lennon|first=P|date=1990|title=Investigating fluency in EFL: A quantitative approach|url=|journal=Language Learning|volume=40|pages=387–417|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1467-1770.1990.tb00669.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories of automaticity postulate that more fluent language users can manage all of the components of language use without paying attention to each individual component of the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LaBerge|first=D|last2=Samuels|first2=S. J.|date=1974|title=Toward a Theory of Automatic Information Process in Reading|url=|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=6|pages=293–323|via=|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(74)90015-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, fluency is achieved when one can access language knowledge and produce language unconsciously, or automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/nrp/Pages/smallbook.aspx|title=Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read|website=www.nichd.nih.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019055748/https://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/nrp/Pages/smallbook.aspx|archivedate=2017-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt; Theories that focus on speed or length and rate of speech typically expect fluent language users to produce language in real time without unusual pauses, false starts, or repetitions (recognizing that some presence of these elements are naturally part of speech).&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt; Fluency is sometimes considered to be a measure of [[Linguistic performance|performance]] rather than an indicator of more [[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] language knowledge, and thus perception and understandability are often key ways that fluency is understood.&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt;

Language fluency is sometimes contrasted with accuracy (or correctness of language use, especially grammatical correctness)&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; and complexity (or a more encompassing knowledge of vocabulary and discourse strategies).&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt; Fluency, accuracy, and complexity are distinct but interrelated components of [[language acquisition]] and [[Language proficiency|proficiency]].

=== Types of fluency ===
There are four commonly discussed types of fluency: reading fluency, oral fluency, oral-reading fluency, and written or compositional fluency. These types of fluency are interrelated, but do not necessarily develop in tandem or linearly. One may develop fluency in certain type(s) and be less fluent or nonfluent in others.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

In the sense of proficiency, "fluency" encompasses a number of related but separable skills:
* '''Reading fluency''' refers to the link between the recognition of words while reading and [[reading comprehension]],&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rasinski/&gt; which manifests itself in the speed and accuracy that one is able to read text.&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt; Research on reading fluency aligns concepts of accuracy, automaticity, and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].&lt;ref name=Rasinski/&gt;  To achieve reading fluency, readers must have knowledge of the content of the language as well as the [[vocabulary]] being used. Interventions designed to help children learn to read fluently generally include some form of repeated reading, but this process may differ for children with [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], who may struggle with reading fluency.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;
* '''Oral fluency''' or '''speaking fluency''' is a measurement both of production and reception of [[speech]], as a fluent speaker must be able to understand and respond to others in conversation. [[Spoken language]] is typically characterized by seemingly non-fluent qualities (e.g., fragmentation, pauses, false starts, hesitation, repetition) because of ‘task stress.’ How orally fluent one is can therefore be understood in terms of perception, and whether these qualities of speech can be perceived as expected and natural (i.e., fluent) or unusual and problematic (i.e., non-fluent).&lt;ref name=Guillot&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44961785|title=Fluency and its teaching|author=Guillot, Marie-Noëlle,|date=1999|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=1853594393|location=Clevedon, U.K.|oclc=44961785}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Oral reading fluency''' is sometimes distinguished from oral fluency. Oral reading fluency refers to the ability to read words accurately and quickly while using good vocal expression and phrasing.&lt;ref name=Rasinski&gt;{{cite book |author=Rasinski, T.

* '''Written or compositional fluency''' can be measured in a variety of ways. Researchers have measured by length of the [[Composition (language)|composition]] (especially under timed conditions), words produced per minute, sentence length, or words per clause. Ratio measures (e.g., words per clause, words per sentence, and words per error-free sentence) have historically been most valid and reliable.&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40664312|title=Second language development in writing : measures of fluency, accuracy, &amp; complexity|author1=Wolfe-Quintero, Kate|date=1998|publisher=Second Language Teaching &amp; Curriculum Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa|author2=Shunji, Inagaki |author3=Hae-Young, Kim|isbn=9780824820695|location=Honolulu|oclc=40664312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluency in second-language acquisition ===

Because an assessment of fluency is typically a measure or characterization of one's language ability, determining fluency may be a more challenging task when the speaker is acquiring a second language. It is generally thought that the later in life a learner approaches the study of a foreign language, the harder it is to acquire receptive  ([[Hearing (sense)|auditory]]) comprehension and fluent production (speaking) skills. For adults, once their mother tongue has already been established, the acquisition of a second language can come more slowly and less completely, ultimately affecting fluency. However, the [[critical period hypothesis]] is a hotly debated topic, with some scholars stating that adults can in fact become fluent in acquiring a second language. For instance, reading and writing skills in a foreign language can be acquired more easily even after the primary [[language acquisition]] period of youth is over.&lt;ref name=harrell/&gt;

So although it is often assumed that young children learn languages more easily than adolescents and adults,{{sfn|McLaughlin|1992}}{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}} the reverse is in fact true; older learners are faster. The only exception to this rule is in [[pronunciation]]. Young children invariably learn to speak their second language with native-like pronunciation, whereas learners who start learning a language at an older age only rarely reach a native-like level.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}}

====Second-language acquisition in children====

Since childhood is a [[critical period]], widespread opinion holds that it is easier for young children to learn a second language than it is for adults.  Children can even acquire native fluency when exposed to the language on a consistent basis with rich interaction in a social setting.  In addition to capacity, factors like; 1) motivation, 2) aptitude, 3) personality characteristics, 4) age of acquisition 5) first language typology 6) socio-economic status and 7) quality and context of L2 input play a role in L2 acquisitions rate and building fluency.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jparadis/Johanne_Paradis_Homepage/Publications_files/P_CSLA_Handbook.pdf|title=Second Language Acquisition in Childhood|last=Paradis|first=Johanne|date=August 2006|website=University of Alberta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509173500/https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jparadis/Johanne_Paradis_Homepage/Publications_files/P_CSLA_Handbook.pdf|archive-date=2018-05-09|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second language acquisition (SLA) has the ability to influence children’s cognitive growth and linguistic development.

Skill that consists of ability to produce words in target language develops until adolescence.  Natural ability to acquire a new language with a deliberate effort may begin to diminish around puberty i.e. 12–14 years of age.  Learning environment, comprehensible instructional materials, teacher, and the learner are indispensable elements in SLA and developing fluency in children.  Extensive reading in L2 can offer twofold benefits in foreign language learning i.e. "reading to comprehend English and reading to learn English".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d3d3/257374693bf714c2cb8f6a311d31cc17ec12.pdf|title=The Role of Unput, Interaction and Output in the Development of Oral Fluency|last=Zhang|first=Shumei|date=December 2009|website=English Language Teaching|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202053320/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d3d3/257374693bf714c2cb8f6a311d31cc17ec12.pdf|archive-date=2017-12-02|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradis (2006)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; study on childhood language acquisition and building fluency examines how first and second language acquisition patterns are generally similar including vocabulary and morphosyntax.  Phonology of first language is usually apparent in SLA and initial L1 influence can be lifelong, even for child L2 learners.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Children can acquire a second language simultaneously (learn L1 and L2 at the same time) or sequentially (learn L1 first and then L2).  In the end, they develop fluency in both with one dominant language which is spoken largely by the community they live in.

According to one source, there are five stages of SLA and developing fluency:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McREL International|title=McREL - The Five Stages of Second Language Acquisition|date=2014-08-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNDNNW6LgWM|accessdate=2017-12-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509173500/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNDNNW6LgWM|archivedate=2018-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2018}}

====Second-language acquisition in adults====

The process of learning a second language or "L2," among older learners differs from younger learners because of their [[working memory]]. Working memory, also connected to fluency because it deals with automatic responses, is vital to language acquisition. This happens when information is stored and manipulated temporarily. During working memory, words are filtered, processed, and rehearsed, and information is stored while focusing on the next piece of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mackey | first1 = A. | last2 = Sachs | first2 = Rebecca | year = 2012 | title = Older Learners in SLA Research: A First Look at Working Memory, Feedback, and L2 Development | url = | journal = Language Learning | volume = 62 | issue = 3| page = 724 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2011.00649.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These false starts, pauses or repetitions found in fluency assessments, can also be found within one's working memory as part of communication.

Those with education at or below a high school level are least likely to take language classes. It has also been found that women and young immigrants are more likely to take language classes.&lt;ref&gt;Adamuti-Trache’ (2012). Language Acquisition Among Adult Immigrants in Canada: The Effect of Premigration Language. Adult Education Quarterly, 63(2), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Further, highly educated immigrants who are searching for skilled jobs – which require interpersonal and intercultural skills that are difficult to learn – are the most affected by lower fluency in the L2.

==Speech-language pathology==
Fluency is a [[speech language pathology]] term that means the smoothness or flow with which sounds, syllables, words and phrases are joined together when speaking quickly.&lt;ref name=harrell&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/center&gt;

The '''Fourth Way enneagram''' is a figure published in 1949 in ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]'' by [[P.D. Ouspensky]], and an integral part of the [[Fourth Way]] esoteric system associated with [[George Gurdjieff]]. The term "[[enneagram (shape)|enneagram]]" derives from two Greek words, ''ennea'' (nine) and ''gramma'' (something written or drawn).

[[File:Enneagram as an octave.svg|thumb|400px|right|Enneagram with point numbers and octave designations for octave beginning at point 9. Points 3 and 6 show "shock points" at which a new Do may enter and develop alongside the existing octave.]]

The enneagram is a nine-pointed figure usually inscribed within a circle.  Within the circle is a triangle connecting points 9, 3 and 6. The inscribed figure resembling a web connects the other six points in a cyclic figure 1-4-2-8-5-7. This number is derived from or corresponds to the recurring decimal .[[142857 (number)|142857]] = 1/7. These six points together with the point numbered 9 are said to represent the main stages of any complete process, and can be related to the notes of a musical [[octave]], 9 being equivalent to "Doh" and 1 to "Re" etc. The points numbered 3 and 6 are said to represent "shock points" which affect the way a process develops. The internal lines between the points; that is, the three-point figure and the six-point figure, are said to show certain non-obvious connections, although here very little elucidation is offered.

==Origins==
As reported by [[P. D. Ouspensky]] the enneagram was introduced by [[George Gurdjieff]] to his study groups in [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Moscow]] in 1916. Ouspensky records this original explication in his book of Gurdjieff's teaching [[In Search of the Miraculous]] where the enneagram  appears as Figure 44 and in further diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;In Search of the Miraculous: Fragments of an Unknown Teaching, 1949, (reprinted 1977), PD Ouspensky, Routledge and Keegan Paul Ltd, London, pp. 285-295, 376-8.&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented as an ancient secret being released for the first time, the truth behind for example the [[philosopher's stone]]. Ouspensky quotes Gurdjieff as saying; "The knowledge of the enneagram has for a very long time been preserved in secret and if it now is, so to speak, made available to all, it is only in an incomplete and theoretical form without instruction from a man who knows". Gurdjieff also remarked "In order to understand the enneagram it must be thought of as in motion, as moving. A motionless enneagram is a dead symbol, the living symbol is in motion"

Although no earlier record of the Fourth Way version of the enneagram can be cited, it has been proposed that it may derive from, or be cognate to the reversed Kabbalistic [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]] as used in “Etude sur les origines de la nature du Zohar”, by S. Karppe, Paris, 1901, pp. 387, the Great Magical Arcanum of [[Eliphas Levi]] which is also composed of a circle triangle and hexad, the Magical Acanum of [[Helena Blavatsky]] in ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' (1877), and [[Leonhard Euler]]'s [[nine-point circle]]. There has also been speculation that it may be related to the Pythagorean [[Tetractys]], which also combines the numbers 3 and 7.

[[Robin Amis]] claims an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] origin, claiming that both Gurdijeff and Ouspensky developed their teaching with insights gained from visits to [[Mount Athos]].&lt;ref name="ChristianFourthWay"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Staff |first= |title=The direct connection between the Fourth Way and Inner Christianity |publisher=Praxis Research Institute |date=14 July 2006 |url=http://www.praxisinstitute.net/Praxis%20Now/Church%20of%20The%20Elders/Christian%20Fourthway.htm |accessdate=2009-08-19 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723083849/http://www.praxisinstitute.net/Praxis%20Now/Church%20of%20The%20Elders/Christian%20Fourthway.htm |archivedate=23 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background of the enneagram in Gurdjieff's cosmology ==

The enneagram according to Gurdjieff shows the "Law of Seven" and the "Law of Three" united and so some explanation of these laws is necessary here.

The Law of Seven or law of octaves, according to which phenomena evolves in seven steps; and the Law of Three, according to which phenomena are produced by three forces, are presented by Gurdjieff as global laws appearing on all scales and essential to his [[cosmology]]. This cosmology offers a view of how the world operates said to derive from [[alchemy]] and more ancient sources, and to complement or complete modern experimental science rather than to contradict it. According to this cosmology everything is material, including [[consciousness]] and [[spirit]], and all matter can be assigned a "density"; consciousness and spirit for example having lower "densities" (and therefore higher "vibrations") than,for example, [[water]] while, for example, [[Rock (geology)|rock]] has a higher "density" and lower "vibration" than water, and so on.

The [[diatonic scale]] in music is said to be an ancient application of the Law of Seven and a convenient way to study it.&lt;ref&gt;In Search of the Miraculous, page 124 Routledga and Keegan, 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; The major musical scale is used with short intervals at mi-fa and ti-do (Ouspensky refers to Ti as "Si" and So as "Sol" and the diagrams on this page reflect his usage). In other words if one thinks of a standard [[musical keyboard]] and takes for example middle C as Do then the following six white keys, DEFGAB will represent the rest of the octave, and the next white key will be the higher C. There will be black keys between each of the white keys, except between E and F (the mi-fa interval) and between B and the higher C (the si-do interval)

In any process described in terms of the Law of Seven, the Mi-Fa interval and the Ti-Do interval are said to be shock points where outside help is needed if the octave is to  continue to develop as intended. A failure to recognize this in terms of human projects is said to be a major reason why things go wrong in general.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM, page 126=129, Routledge and Kegan Paul 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; The octave of [[electromagnetic radiation]] that appears as visible [[light]], and the [[periodic table]] are said to be examples of physical phenomena where the underlying Law of Seven can be detected (although no detail is offered here). It should be noted that the musical scale Gurdjieff is quoted as using &lt;ref&gt;In Search of the Miraculous Fig 11, page 125 Routledga and Keegan, 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; is not the modern standard musical scale but  [[Ptolemy's intense diatonic scale]], a [[just intonation]] scale associated with the Renaissance composer and musical theorist [[Gioseffo Zarlino]].

The Law of Three holds that three forces act on any event, which can be called  Active, Passive, and Neutralizing forces, or simply First, Second, and Third forces respectively. These three forces can appear in any order, 123 for example or 312, giving 6 possible "triads" of forces describing 6 very broad types of event. &lt;ref&gt; [[Ouspensky: A Further Record]] p174, accessed through web, http://holybooks.lichtenbergpress.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/A-Further-Record.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;[[Human|Humanity]] is said to be "third force blind", to have difficulty recognizing the third force, which may appear to us in the guise of a result or of a background environment."People cannot perceive the third force directly any more than they can spatially perceive the '[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]'" Gurdjieff is quoted as saying.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM, page 77, Routledge and Kegan Paul 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the Law of Seven one of the three forces appears as the "do" of the octave and the other two appear as the "shocks" (which also function as the do of new octaves) The explanation of these laws in [[In Search of the Miraculous]] is largely in abstract terms, with some detail given for the so-called "food diagram" described below and the cosmic octave, the [[Ray of Creation]].

The enneagram shows the Law of Seven and the Law of Three in a single symbol with the three forces joined in a triangle at the 3,6 and 9 points, and in addition six inner lines (hexad) following the 1,4,2,8,5,7,1,... sequence. The meaning of these six inner lines is not, by Ouspensky's account, made clear by Gurdjieff. One shock point is shown on the enneagram at point 3, which is the Mi-Fa interval where it might be expected. However the other is at point 6, at the So-La interval. It might have been expected to be at the Ti-Do interval, and Gurdjieff is presented as offering this apparent mistake as a mystery to be solved.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM, page291, Routledge and Kegan Paul 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; Ouspensky offers the solution that the shock at point 3 itself develops as an octave to point 6, where its own Mi-Fa interval occurs. This second octave cannot develop unless it has a shock at its own Mi-Fa, and this is the shock which in fact occurs at point 6.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM, page378, Routledge and Kegan Paul 1950/1973&lt;/ref&gt; The example of the "food diagram" enneagram summarized below might clarify this.

==Application to processes: the food diagram==

As the enneagram figure is a symbol said to represent the "law of seven" and the "law of three" in unity, therefore, according to this view, the figure can be used to describe any natural whole phenomenon, cosmos, process in life or any other piece of knowledge. The figure is the central organizing glyph of the Fourth Way's view of the material world which Gurdjieff is quoted by Ouspensky as relating to [[alchemy]].

[[File:Enneagram evolution of food.svg|thumb|310px|right|Enneagram representing the evolution of food with "self remembering" at point 6]]

The most detailed example of how this is said to work, given in ''In Search of the Miraculous'', is an explanation of how Gurdjieff believed inputs to the human body ("food", "air" and "impressions", collectively regarded as types of food) are processed into the so-called "higher substances" necessary for higher consciousness to function. In Gurdjieff's view "everything is material"; consciousness and spirit are to be regarded as aspects of matter, although more refined or of a "higher vibration" than perceptible aspects. This proposition is an essential basis for Gurdjieff's view of the evolution of food into the "higher substances" necessary for higher consciousness; briefly summarized below from the account in ''In Search of the Miraculous''.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM figures 25-39, pages 182-192;figures 59 and 60, Routledge and Kegan Paul,1950&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Fourth Way]], a later collection of Ouspensky's talks, is a supplementary source for the same material.

At point 9 ordinary food (beginning as Do) is eaten and enters the body and digestion begins. The "density" of human food is assigned a number, 768.

At point 1 it is said to be processed in the gut  as Re and is refined to a "density" of 384 the same "density" as water.

At point 2 the food is further refined to  Mi and assigned a density of 192, the same density as air. It is ready to enter the blood stream.

At point 3, Mi-Fa, occurs a "shock". Air can provide this shock because it also is of density 192, and furthermore this air enters as a new Do

At point 4 the original food octave is at "Fa" but  the new air octave is at Re. They are both in the bloodstream at "density" 96, the "density" of hormones and vitamins and rarefied gases and animal magnetism "and so on". At this point we reach the end of "what is regarded as matter by our physics and chemistry" &lt;ref&gt;ISOTM 1950 page 175&lt;/ref&gt; It should be remembered that Gurdjieff is here speaking in 1916.

The substances or energies at point 5  are assigned a "density" of 48 and used in thought. These are the So or "Sol" part of the original food octave and the Mi part of the air octave.

Point 6 being where "impressions", regarded as a type of food, are said to enter the body. "Impressions" are said to also have a "density" of 48, and can serve as a shock if they are intensified by some such means as the exercise of "self-remembering" taught by Gurdjieff, thus allowing the air and impressions octaves to proceed. Otherwise only the ordinary food octave, shown in black in the diagram, proceeds.

Point 7 represents emotional and other energies, of a "density" of 24. If "self-remembering" occurs this will be the Fa point for the air octave and the Re point for the impressions octave. Otherwise it will just be the La point for the original food octave.

At point 8, the "Si" or Ti at the end of the first "ordinary food" octave represents the sexual energies, of "density" 12; which are the "highest substance" according to Gurdjieff which the body produces naturally without conscious intervention. A desire to conserve this "higher substances" for esoteric use is said to be the original reason for religious celibacy. With the conscious intervention at point 6 of "self remembering" further and more useful "higher substances" are created, represented by the air octave's So or "Sol" at point 8 and the impression octave's Mi at point 8. This Mi of "density" 12 is the "higher substance" primarily necessary for Gurdjieff's esoteric method.&lt;ref&gt;ISOTM 1950, page 193&lt;/ref&gt;(Ouspensky makes some further remarks on the nature of this Mi 12 and Sol 12 in his book ''[[Fourth Way (book)|Fourth Way]]''.) A further conscious shock, requiring "a special type of control over the emotions" at point 9 would enable a new "higher" or spiritual body to begin to grow, this is represented by Gurdjieff as the aim of his and other esoteric traditions. Although not shown in the diagram on this page, the Air octave, if it has a shock at Point 6 in fact may proceed to La with a "density" of 6.

Ouspensky related the inner six-line figure  of the Food Diagram enneagram to the circulation of the blood. Point 1, he wrote, represented the digestive system, point 2 the blood stream, point 4 the breathing system, point 5 the brain, point 7 the spinal cord and point 8 the sympathetic nervous system and sex organs, and the lines "showed the direction of the flow or distribution of arterial blood in the organism and then its return in the form of venous blood" &lt;ref&gt;ISOTM 1950, page 378&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other applications to processes==
Other applications of the enneagram to describing processes can be found in writings influenced by those of Gurdjieff,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[A.G.E. Blake]]'s ''The Intelligent Enneagram'' (Shambhala, 1995), an excerpt from this book plus other material and references on the enneagram of process can be found on Blake's [http://www.duversity.org/ideas/enneagram.html "Duversity" site ], accessed 25 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; notably in the writings of [[J.G. Bennett]]. In his book ''Gurdjieff: Making a New World''&lt;ref&gt;''Gurdjieff: Making a New World'', Spiritual Classics Edition 1992, Appendix on the enneagram&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett describes the workings of a community kitchen in terms of the enneagram and offers some explanation of the meaning of the internal lines. Another of his books, ''Enneagram Studies'',&lt;ref&gt;''Enneagram Studies''. York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; is devoted to the subject, offering nine examples of enneagrams in various applications. [[Rodney Collin]] in his book ''The Theory of Celestial Influence'' relates the enneagram to the planets of the solar system, and the yearly cycle, and also offers some explanation of the inner lines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.holybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Theory-of-Celestial-Influence.pdf pages 108 and 190, Figures 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications to human typology==

The [[Enneagram of Personality]] originates from the mapping of nine "ego fixations" on the enneagram by [[Oscar Ichazo]]. A book published in 2017, "The Enneagram: Living and Dead" by Plavan N. Go, attempts to verify it from the viewpoint of Gurdjieff's theories, showing the relevance of the nine personality types and their mapping on the enneagram based on the interpretation of the enneagram according to the Law of Three, the logic of three into four (O+C+N &gt; H), and the Law of Seven.&lt;ref&gt;http://gurdjieff.la.coocan.jp/literature/The_Enneagram_ENG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker''' ('''FLRW''') '''[[Riemannian metric|metric]]''' is an [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solution]] of [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equations]] of [[general relativity]]; it describes a [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneous]], [[isotropic]], [[metric expansion of space|expanding]] (or otherwise, contracting) [[universe]] that is [[path-connected]], but not necessarily [[simply connected space|simply connected]].&lt;ref&gt;For an early reference, see Robertson (1935); Robertson ''assumes'' multiple connectedness in the positive curvature case and says that "we are still free to restore" simple connectedness.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LaLu95"&gt;{{Citation |author1=M.

Robertson]] and [[Arthur Geoffrey Walker]] are customarily grouped as '''Friedmann''' or '''Friedmann–Robertson–Walker''' ('''FRW''') or '''Robertson–Walker''' ('''RW''') or '''Friedmann–Lemaître''' ('''FL'''). This model is sometimes called the ''Standard Model'' of modern [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]],&lt;ref name=Goobar&gt;{{citation |author=L. Bergström, A. Goobar |date=2006 |title=Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQYu_sutWAoC&amp;pg=PA61 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Sprint]] |isbn=3-540-32924-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although such a description is also associated with the further developed [[Lambda-CDM model]]. The FLRW model was developed independently by the named authors in the 1920s and 1930s.

== General metric ==

The FLRW metric starts with the assumption of [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of space. It also assumes that the spatial component of the metric can be time-dependent. The generic metric which meets these conditions is
:&lt;math&gt;- c^2 \mathrm{d}\tau^2 = - c^2 \mathrm{d}t^2 + {a(t)}^2 \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma}^2&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; ranges over a 3-dimensional space of uniform curvature, that is, [[elliptical space]], [[Euclidean space]], or [[hyperbolic space]]. It is normally written as a function of three spatial coordinates, but there are several conventions for doing so, detailed below. &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on ''t'' — all of the time dependence is in the function ''a''(''t''), known as the "[[Scale factor (universe)|scale factor]]".

===Reduced-circumference polar coordinates===
In reduced-circumference polar coordinates the spatial metric has the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma}^2 = \frac{\mathrm{d}r^2}{1-k r^2} + r^2 \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Omega}^2, \quad \text{where } \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Omega}^2 = \mathrm{d}\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, \mathrm{d}\phi^2.&lt;/math&gt;

''k'' is a constant representing the curvature of the space. There are two common unit conventions:
*''k'' may be taken to have units of length&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, in which case ''r'' has units of length and ''a''(''t'') is unitless. ''k'' is then the [[Gaussian curvature]] of the space at the time when ''a''(''t'') = 1. ''r'' is sometimes called the reduced [[circumference]] because it is equal to the measured circumference of a circle (at that value of ''r''), centered at the origin, divided by 2{{pi}} (like the ''r'' of [[Schwarzschild coordinates]]). Where appropriate, ''a''(''t'') is often chosen to equal 1 in the present cosmological era, so that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; measures [[comoving distance]].
*Alternatively, ''k'' may be taken to belong to the set {−1,0,+1} (for negative, zero, and positive curvature respectively). Then ''r'' is unitless and ''a''(''t'') has units of length. When ''k'' = ±1, ''a''(''t'') is the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of the space, and may also be written ''R''(''t'').

A disadvantage of reduced circumference coordinates is that they cover only half of the 3-sphere in the case of positive curvature—circumferences beyond that point begin to decrease, leading to degeneracy. (This is not a problem if space is [[elliptical geometry|elliptical]], i.e. a 3-sphere with opposite points identified.)

===Hyperspherical coordinates===
In ''hyperspherical'' or ''curvature-normalized'' coordinates the coordinate ''r'' is proportional to radial distance; this gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma}^2 = \mathrm{d}r^2 + S_k(r)^2 \, \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Omega}^2&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; is as before and
:&lt;math&gt;S_k(r) =
\begin{cases}
\sqrt{k}^{\,-1} \sin (r \sqrt{k}), &amp;k &gt; 0 \\
r, &amp;k = 0 \\
\sqrt{|k|}^{\,-1} \sinh (r \sqrt{|k|}), &amp;k &lt; 0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

As before, there are two common unit conventions:
*''k'' may be taken to have units of length&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, in which case ''r'' has units of length and ''a''(''t'' ) is unitless.  ''k'' is then the [[Gaussian curvature]] of the space at the time when ''a''(''t'' ) = 1.  Where appropriate, ''a''(''t'' ) is often chosen to equal 1 in the present cosmological era, so that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; measures [[comoving distance]].
*Alternatively, as before, ''k'' may be taken to belong to the set {−1,0,+1} (for negative, zero, and positive curvature respectively). Then ''r'' is unitless and ''a''(''t'' ) has units of length. When ''k'' = ±1, ''a''(''t'' ) is the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of the space, and may also be written ''R''(''t'' ).  Note that, when ''k'' = +1, ''r'' is essentially a third angle along with ''θ'' and ''φ''. The letter ''χ''  may be used instead of&amp;nbsp;''r''.

Though it is usually defined piecewise as above, ''S'' is an [[analytic function]] of both ''k'' and ''r''. It can also be written as a [[power series]]
:&lt;math&gt;S_k(r) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n k^n r^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = r - \frac{k r^3}{6} + \frac{k^2 r^5}{120} - \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
or as
:&lt;math&gt;S_k(r) = r \; \mathrm{sinc} \, (r \sqrt{k})&lt;/math&gt;
where sinc is the unnormalized [[sinc function]] and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{k}&lt;/math&gt; is one of the imaginary, zero or real square roots of ''k''. These definitions are valid for all ''k''.

===Cartesian coordinates===
When ''k'' = 0 one may write simply
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma}^2 = \mathrm{d}x^2 + \mathrm{d}y^2 + \mathrm{d}z^2.&lt;/math&gt;
This can be extended to ''k'' ≠ 0 by defining
:&lt;math&gt; x = r \cos \theta \,&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; y = r \sin \theta \cos \phi \,&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt; z = r \sin \theta \sin \phi \,&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''r'' is one of the radial coordinates defined above, but this is rare.

===Curvature===
====Cartesian coordinates====
In flat &lt;math&gt;(k=0)&lt;/math&gt; FLRW space using Cartesian coordinates, the surviving components of the [[Ricci tensor]] are&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wald |first=Robert |title=General Relativity |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_{tt} = - 3 \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}, \quad R_{xx}= R_{yy} = R_{zz} = c^{-2} (a \ddot{a} + 2 \dot{a}^2) &lt;/math&gt;
and the Ricci scalar is  
:&lt;math&gt; R = 6 c^{-2} \left(\frac{\ddot{a}(t)}{a(t)}  +  \frac{\dot{a}^2(t)}{a^2(t)}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

====Spherical coordinates====
In more general FLRW space using spherical coordinates (called "reduced-circumference polar coordinates" above), the surviving components of the Ricci tensor are&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icc.ub.edu/~liciaverde/Cosmology.pdf |title=Cosmology |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_{tt} = - 3 \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{rr}=\frac{c^{-2}(a(t)\ddot{a}(t) + 2\dot{a}^2(t)) + 2k}{1 - kr^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_{\theta\theta} = r^2(c^{-2}(a(t)\ddot{a}(t) + 2\dot{a}^2(t)) + 2k)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\phi\phi} =r^2(c^{-2}(a(t)\ddot{a}(t) + 2\dot{a}^2(t)) + 2k)\sin^2(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
 
and the Ricci scalar is  
:&lt;math&gt; R =  6  \left(\frac{\ddot{a}(t)}{c^2 a(t)}  +  \frac{\dot{a}^2(t)}{c^2 a^2(t)} + \frac{k}{a^2(t)}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Solutions==
{{General relativity sidebar |solutions}}
{{main|Friedmann equations}}

Einstein's field equations are not used in deriving the general form for the metric: it follows from the geometric properties of homogeneity and isotropy. However, determining the time evolution of &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; does require Einstein's field equations together with a way of calculating the density, &lt;math&gt;\rho (t),&lt;/math&gt; such as a [[equation of state (cosmology)|cosmological equation of state]].

This metric has an analytic solution to [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equations]] &lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}} T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; giving the [[Friedmann equations]] when the [[energy-momentum tensor]] is similarly assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous. The resulting equations are:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=P. Ojeda and H. Rosu |date=2006 |title=Supersymmetry of FRW barotropic cosmologies |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1191–1196 |doi=10.1007/s10773-006-9123-2 |arxiv=gr-qc/0510004 |bibcode=2006IJTP...45.1152R}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)^{2} + \frac{kc^{2}}{a^2} - \frac{\Lambda c^{2}}{3} = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2\frac{\ddot a}{a} + \left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)^{2} + \frac{kc^{2}}{a^2} - \Lambda c^{2} = -\frac{8\pi G}{c^{2}} p.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations are the basis of the standard [[big bang]] cosmological model including the current [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM]] model. Because the FLRW model assumes homogeneity, some popular accounts mistakenly assert that the big bang model cannot account for the observed lumpiness of the universe. In a strictly FLRW model, there are no clusters of galaxies, stars or people, since these are objects much denser than a typical part of the universe. Nonetheless, the FLRW model is used as a first approximation for the evolution of the real, lumpy universe because it is simple to calculate, and models which calculate the lumpiness in the universe are added onto the FLRW models as extensions. Most cosmologists agree that the [[observable universe]] is well approximated by an ''almost FLRW model'', i.e., a model which follows the FLRW metric apart from [[primordial fluctuations|primordial density fluctuations]]. {{As of|2003}}, the theoretical implications of the various extensions to the FLRW model appear to be well understood, and the goal is to make these consistent with observations from [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] and [[WMAP]].

If the spacetime is [[Spacetime topology|multiply connected]], then each event will be represented by more than one [[tuple]] of coordinates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Interpretation===
The pair of equations given above is equivalent to the following pair of equations
:&lt;math&gt;{\dot \rho} = - 3 \frac{\dot a}{a}\left(\rho+\frac{p}{c^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\ddot a}{a} = - \frac{4\pi G}{3}\left(\rho + \frac{3p}{c^{2}}\right) + \frac{\Lambda c^{2}}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the spatial curvature index, serving as a [[constant of integration]] for the first equation.

The first equation can be derived also from [[Thermodynamics of the universe|thermodynamical considerations]] and is equivalent to the [[first law of thermodynamics]], assuming the expansion of the universe is an [[adiabatic process]] (which is implicitly assumed in the derivation of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric).

The second equation states that both the energy density and the pressure cause the expansion rate of the universe &lt;math&gt;{\dot a}&lt;/math&gt; to decrease, i.e., both cause a deceleration in the expansion of the universe. This is a consequence of [[gravitation]], with pressure playing a similar role to that of energy (or mass) density, according to the principles of [[general relativity]]. The [[cosmological constant]], on the other hand, [[Dark energy|causes an acceleration in the expansion]] of the universe.

===Cosmological constant===
The [[cosmological constant]] term can be omitted if we make the following replacements
:&lt;math&gt;\rho \rightarrow \rho + \frac{\Lambda c^{2}}{8 \pi G}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p \rightarrow p - \frac{\Lambda c^{4}}{8 \pi G}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the [[cosmological constant]] can be interpreted as arising from a form of energy which has negative pressure, equal in magnitude to its (positive) energy density:
:&lt;math&gt;p = - \rho c^2. \,&lt;/math&gt;
Such form of energy—a generalization of the notion of a [[cosmological constant]]—is known as [[dark energy]].

In fact, in order to get a term which causes an acceleration of the universe expansion, it is enough to have a [[scalar field theory|scalar field]] which satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;p &lt; - \frac {\rho c^2} {3}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
Such a field is sometimes called [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]].

===Newtonian interpretation===
This is due to McCrea and Milne &lt;ref&gt;McCrea, W. H.; Milne, E. A. (1934). "Newtonian universes and the curvature of space". Quarterly Journal of Mathematics. 5: 73–80.&lt;/ref&gt; although sometimes incorrectly ascribed to Friedmann. The Friedmann equations are equivalent to this pair of equations:
:&lt;math&gt; - a^3 {\dot \rho} = 3 a^2 {\dot a} \rho + \frac{3 a^2 p {\dot a}}{c^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\dot a}^2}{2} - \frac{G \frac{4 \pi a^3}{3} \rho}{a} = - \frac{k c^2}{2} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The first equation says that the decrease in the mass contained in a fixed cube (whose side is momentarily ''a'') is the amount which leaves through the sides due to the expansion of the universe plus the mass equivalent of the work done by pressure against the material being expelled. This is the conservation of mass-energy ([[first law of thermodynamics]]) contained within a part of the universe.

The second equation says that the kinetic energy (seen from the origin) of a particle of unit mass moving with the expansion plus its (negative) gravitational potential energy (relative to the mass contained in the sphere of matter closer to the origin) is equal to a constant related to the curvature of the universe. In other words, the energy (relative to the origin) of a co-moving particle in free-fall is conserved. General relativity merely adds a connection between the spatial curvature of the universe and the energy of such a particle: positive total energy implies negative curvature and negative total energy implies positive curvature.

The [[cosmological constant]] term is assumed to be treated as dark energy and thus merged into the density and pressure terms.

During the [[Planck epoch]], one cannot neglect [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] effects. So they may cause a deviation from the Friedmann equations.

== Name and history ==

The Soviet mathematician [[Alexander Friedmann]] first derived the main results of the FLRW model in 1922 and 1924. Although the prestigious physics journal ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' published his work, it remained relatively unnoticed by his contemporaries. Friedmann was in direct communication with [[Albert Einstein]], who, on behalf of ''Zeitschrift für Physik'', acted as the scientific referee of Friedmann's work. Eventually Einstein acknowledged the correctness of Friedmann's calculations, but failed to appreciate the physical significance of Friedmann's predictions.

Friedmann died in 1925. In 1927, [[Georges Lemaître]], a Belgian priest, astronomer and periodic professor of physics at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]], arrived independently at results similar to those of Friedmann and published them in the ''Annales de la Société Scientifique de Bruxelles'' (Annals of the Scientific Society of Brussels).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author= G. Lemaître |title= Un Univers homogène de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des nébuleuses extra-galactiques |journal= Annales de la Société Scientifique de Bruxelles |volume= 47 |page= 49 |date= April 1927 |url= http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1927ASSB...47...49L&amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;filetype=.pdf |language= French |bibcode = 
 1927ASSB...47...49L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe obtained by [[Edwin Hubble]] in the late 1920s, Lemaître's results were noticed in particular by [[Arthur Eddington]], and in 1930–31 Lemaître's paper was translated into English and published in the ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]''.

[[Howard P. Robertson]] from the US and [[Arthur Geoffrey Walker]] from the UK explored the problem further during the 1930s. In 1935 Robertson and Walker rigorously proved that the FLRW metric is the only one on a spacetime that is spatially homogeneous and isotropic (as noted above, this is a geometric result and is not tied specifically to the equations of general relativity, which were always assumed by Friedmann and Lemaître).

This solution, often called the Robertson–Walker ''metric'' since they proved its generic properties, is different from the dynamical "Friedmann-Lemaître" ''models'', which are specific solutions for ''a''(''t'') which assume that the only contributions to stress-energy are cold matter ("dust"), radiation, and a cosmological constant.

== Einstein's radius of the universe ==

'''Einstein's radius of the universe''' is the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of space of [[Einstein's universe]], a long-abandoned [[Static spacetime|static]] model that was supposed to represent our universe in idealized form. Putting

&lt;math&gt;\dot{a} = \ddot{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

in the Friedmann equation, the radius of curvature of space of this universe (Einstein's radius) is{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

&lt;math&gt;R_E=c/\sqrt {4\pi G\rho}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant|Newtonian gravitational constant]], and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of space of this universe. The numerical value of Einstein's radius is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; [[light year]]s.

[[File:Jerusalem Modell BW 10.JPG|thumb|275px|Model of '''Herod's Jerusalem Palace-Fortress''' in the northwest corner of the Upper City walls. The three towers, from L to R, are Phasael, Hippicus, and Mariamne. Just beneath the latter two, a portion of the reconstruction of the palace building itself is visible.]]

'''Herod's Palace at Jerusalem''' was built in the last quarter of the 1st century BC by [[Herod the Great|Herod I the Great]], [[List of Hasmonean and Herodian rulers|King of Judea]] from 37 BC to 4 BC. It was the second most important building in [[Jerusalem]], after the [[Herod's Temple|Temple]] itself, in Herod’s day and was situated at the northwestern wall of the Upper City of Jerusalem (the Western Hill abandoned after the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]] [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|sacking of Jerusalem]]). Herod lived in it as a principal residence, but not permanently, as he owned other palace-fortresses, notably at [[Masada]], [[Herodium]] and [[Caesarea Maritima]]. Nothing remains of the Jerusalem Palace today except for portions of the surrounding wall-and-tower complex, much altered and generally known as "the Citadel" (see [[Tower of David]]). The site of the former palace is now occupied by the [[Tower of David#Tower of David Museum|Tower of David Museum]], a police station, and a former Turkish barracks/prison known as the ''Kishle''.

==Location and associated structures==
[[Image:Jerusalem-TowerOfDavid 001.jpg|thumb|right|The "Tower of David"—seen here from the inner courtyard of the Citadel—was built on the base of the Tower of Hippicus.]]

Herod's palace-fortress in Jerusalem stood along the western city wall, in the area now taken by the [[Armenian Quarter]], starting in the north at the Kishle building and ending at the gate called by [[Bargil Pixner]] the Gate of the Essenes on [[Mount Zion]]. It consisted mainly of two palace wings placed north and south of a large garden. Immediately north of the complex, in the area of today's [[Tower of David|Citadel]] and [[Jaffa Gate]], Herod erected three huge towers, as an additional protection and last refuge in case of danger. These he called after people close to him - Hippicus after a friend, [[Phasael]] after his brother, and [[Mariamne I|Mariamne]] after his favourite wife. These towers strengthened the northwest corner of the [[Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period#Hasmonean Kingdom|First Wall]], the city wall built by the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmoneans]] sometime between 142-BC. Of the three towers, only the massive lower part of the [[Hippicus Tower]] (or the Phasael Tower, after some researchers)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 27925783|title = The 'Tower of David'—Phasael or Hippicus?|journal = Israel Exploration Journal|volume = 31|issue = 1/2|pages = 57–65|last1 = Geva|first1 = Hillel|year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; have survived. Remains of two older, Hasmonean towers (the Southern and Middle Towers) have been found in the present Citadel courtyard, which are unrelated to the missing Herodian towers.

During the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, the tower, and by extension the Citadel as a whole, acquired its alternative name - the [[Tower of David]] - after the Byzantines, mistakenly identifying the hill as [[Mount Zion]], presumed it to be David's palace. This name is still in use today, although in the 19th century an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] minaret erected between 1635-65 over the southern wall of the Citadel took over the title of "Tower of David", so that the name can now refer to either the whole Citadel or the minaret alone.

==Description==
As with his [[Herod's Temple|Temple]], Herod's Jerusalem Palace was constructed on an elevated platform of about 1,000 feet (north-south) by 180 feet (east-west). Resting on a series of retaining walls rising 13 to 16 feet above ground level. It consisted of two main buildings, each with its own banquet halls, baths, and accommodations for hundreds of guests. The two wings were named after [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Augustus|Caesar]]. In the center of the palace were gardens with porticoes. The grounds included groves, canals, and ponds fitted with bronze fountains. The ''[[praetorium]]'' at the Palace was, after Herod's death, the official residence of the Roman governors when they came to Jerusalem during major Jewish festivals. This was probably the site of the trial of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] by [[Pontius Pilate]] (see [[Pilate's court]]).

To the north of Herod's Palace were the three immense towers,
* The [[Phasael Tower]] was the largest. It was named after [[Phasael|Herod's brother]] and stood 145 feet high.
* The [[Hippicus Tower]] was named after a friend of Herod and stood 132 feet high.
* The [[Mariamne Tower]] was named after Herod’s [[Mariamne (second wife of Herod)|Hasmonean wife]] whom he had executed. Josephus said that "the king considering it appropriate that the tower named after a woman should surpass in decoration those called after men." It stood 74 feet high and was accounted the most beautiful of the three.

==Josephus’ description==
The ancient writer and historian [[Josephus]] vividly described the "wondrous" palace in ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' (''ca.'' 75 AD). Book 5, chapter 4 tells that

&lt;blockquote&gt;The largeness also of the stones was wonderful; for they were not made of common small stones, nor of such large ones only as men could carry, but they were of white marble, cut out of the rock; each stone was twenty cubits in length, and ten in breadth, and five in depth. They were so exactly united to one another, that each tower looked like one entire rock of stone, so growing naturally, and afterward cut by the hand of the artificers into their present shape and corners; so little, or not at all, did their joints or connexion appear low as these towers were themselves on the north side of the wall, the king had a palace inwardly thereto adjoined, which exceeds all my ability to describe it; for it was so very curious as to want no cost nor skill in its construction, but was entirely walled about to the height of thirty cubits, and was adorned with towers at equal distances, and with large bed-chambers, that would contain beds for a hundred guests a-piece, in which the variety of the stones is not to be expressed; for a large quantity of those that were rare of that kind was collected together. Their roofs were also wonderful, both for the length of the beams, and the splendor of their ornaments. The number of the rooms was also very great, and the variety of the figures that were about them was prodigious; their furniture was complete, and the greatest part of the vessels that were put in them was of silver and gold. There were besides many porticoes, one beyond another, round about, and in each of those porticoes curious pillars; yet were all the courts that were exposed to the air everywhere green. There were, moreover, several groves of trees, and long walks through them, with deep canals, and cisterns, that in several parts were filled with brazen statues, through which the water ran out. There were withal many dove-courts of tame pigeons about the canals. But indeed it is not possible to give a complete description of these palaces; and the very remembrance of them is a torment to one, as putting one in mind what vastly rich buildings that fire which was kindled by the robbers hath consumed; for these were not burnt by the Romans, but by these internal plotters, as we have already related, in the beginning of their rebellion. That fire began at the tower of Antonia, and went on to the palaces, and consumed the upper parts of the three towers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Flavius Josephus]], ''The Wars of the Jews, or History of the Destruction of Jerusalem'', trans. [[William Whiston]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2850/2850-h/book5.htm#noteref-11 Book V, Chapt. 4, Verse 4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fate of the Palace==
At the creation of the Roman province of [[Roman Judea|Judaea]] in the year 6 CE, its governors—holding the rank of a [[Prefect#Ancient Rome|prefect]] until the year 41 and that of a [[Procurator (Roman Empire)|procurator]] after that—took up residence in Herod's palace.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 66 CE, the Roman governor [[Gessius Florus]] set up a mass crucifixion of Jews, sparking the [[First Jewish Rebellion]]. Rebelling Jews entered and burnt the palace. Only the three towers remained partially standing.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} When the future Roman emperor [[Titus]] destroyed most of Jerusalem in 70 CE, he spared these and set up the camp of the [[Legio X Fretensis|Tenth Legion Fretensis]] in the area of the palace ruins, a camp which covered the entire Western Hill.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} One of the towers—a rebuilt Hippicus (or Phasael) Tower on its intact base—became known as the "[[Tower of David]]".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} This was due to the fact that during the Byzantine Period, the Western Hill had been mistakenly identified as [[Mount Zion]] and the remains of the one surviving Herodian tower were presumed to be King David's palace.

Evidence shows that Crusaders fortified and heightened the 15 foot thick Hasmonean city wall and that Arabs, who [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|conquered Jerusalem]] in 637, did the same.{{dubious|Terrible mess. 1- If it only concerns the city walls outside the royal palace area, it's irrelevant here. 2- What Arabs? Early Isl. Period (Rashidun, Umayyad etc. through Fatimid) or post-Crusader (Ayyubid, Mamluk)? 900-year span! 3- Why mention 638 AFTER 12th c. Crusaders?|date=February 2016}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

During the 1160s the kings of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem built in the same general area a royal palace of their own, of which close to nothing remains.&lt;ref name="BoasJlm"&gt;Adrian J. Boas. ''Jerusalem in the Time of the Crusades: Society, Landscape and Art in the Holy City under Frankish Rule.'' Pages 79-82. Routledge 2009. {{ISBN|9780415488754}}.

''Jerusalem in the Crusader Period.'' Bar-Ilan University, Internet Educational Activities, 1997. "''Adjoining the Citadel to the south was the royal palace of the Crusader kings.''"  [http://www.biu.ac.il/js/rennert/history_9.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 19th-century Egyptian barracks and later prison—locally known as the ''Kishle''—was built adjacent to the Citadel's southern moat and was used, successively, by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]]'s troops (1834-40/41), the Turks (1840/41-1917), the British (1917–48), the Jordanians (1948–67) and in parts by the Israeli police after 1967. The very popular Tower of David Museum, located at the Citadel, is also administering the Kishle building, thus covering the northernmost part of the palace.

==20th and 21st century excavations==
In the 1970s, excavations outside the city wall disclosed the exit of a water drain belonging to Herod's Palace. This culvert transported water from the palace into the [[Hinnom Valley]]. Until recently, no portion of Herod's palace proper—excluding, that is, the surrounding walls-and-towers complex—had ever been uncovered. In 2001, however, excavations disclosed two palace walls, constructed of the easily recognizable Herodian hewn giant blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Schaalje, Jacqueline (2001),  [http://www.jewishmag.com/48mag/herod/herod.htm "Israeli Archaeologists Discover Herod's Palace"], ''[[The Jewish Magazine]]'' (October 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Even these probably did not belong to the palace proper, but were part of the retaining walls for its base, a construction similar to that used by Herod at the Temple Mount. Excavations by [[Ruth Amiran]] and [[Avraham Eitan]] have also revealed some parts of the superstructure which included sections of painted plaster.

The ''Kishle'' prison excavations are accessible every Friday morning when guided tours are organised by the Tower of David Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Tower of David Museum: reservations for guided tours of the Kishle and Citadel moat  [http://www.tod.org.il/en/the-kishle-and-the-citadel-moat/]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51433">The '''history of molecular biology''' begins in the 1930s with the convergence of various, previously distinct biological and physical disciplines: [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]], [[microbiology]], [[virology]] and [[physics]].  With the hope of understanding life at its most fundamental level, numerous physicists and chemists also took an interest in what would become [[molecular biology]].

In its modern sense, molecular biology attempts to explain the phenomena of life starting from the [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] properties that generate them.  Two categories of macromolecules in particular are the focus of the molecular biologist: 1) [[nucleic acid]]s, among which the most famous is [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (or DNA), the constituent of [[gene]]s, and 2) [[protein]]s, which are the active agents of living organisms. One definition of the scope of molecular biology therefore is to characterize the structure, function and relationships between these two types of macromolecules. This relatively limited definition will suffice to allow us to establish a date for the so-called "molecular revolution", or at least to establish a chronology of its most fundamental developments.

== General overview ==
In its earliest manifestations, molecular biology&amp;mdash;the name was coined by [[Warren Weaver]] of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in 1938&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Molecular Biology: Origin of the Term|last = Weaver|first = Warren|date = 6 November 1970|journal = Science|doi = 10.1126/science.170.3958.581-a|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 170|issue = 3958|pages = 581–582|jstor = 1731491|issn = 0036-8075|publisher = American Association for the Advancement of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;was an idea of physical and chemical explanations of life, rather than a coherent discipline.  Following the advent of the [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian-chromosome theory of heredity]] in the 1910s and the maturation of [[atomic theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]] in the 1920s, such explanations seemed within reach.  Weaver and others encouraged (and funded) research at the intersection of biology, chemistry and physics, while prominent physicists such as [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger]] turned their attention to biological speculation.  However, in the 1930s and 1940s it was by no means clear which&amp;mdash;if any&amp;mdash;cross-disciplinary research would bear fruit; work in [[colloid chemistry]], [[biophysics]] and [[radiation biology]], [[crystallography]], and other emerging fields all seemed promising.

In 1940, [[George Beadle]] and [[Edward Tatum]] demonstrated the existence of a precise relationship between genes and proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.27.11.499 | last1 = Beadle | first1 = G.

In 1944, [[Oswald Avery]], working at the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute of New York]], demonstrated that genes are made up of DNA&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1084/jem.79.2.137| volume = 79| issue = 2| pages = 137–158| last = Avery| first = Oswald T.|author2=Colin M.

In 1952, [[Alfred Hershey]] and [[Martha Chase]] confirmed that the genetic material of the [[bacteriophage]], the virus which infects bacteria, is made up of DNA&lt;ref&gt;[http://jgp.rupress.org/cgi/content/abstract/36/1/39 Hershey, A.D. and Chase, M. (1952) "Independent functions of viral protein and nucleic acid in growth of bacteriophage"] ''J Gen Physiol.''&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Hershey–Chase experiment]]). In 1953, [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] discovered the double helical structure of the DNA molecule.&lt;ref name=FWPUB&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Watson J.D. |author2=Crick F.H.C. | pmid=13054692 | doi = 10.1038/171737a0 | url= http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf | title=A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid | journal=Nature | volume=171 | pages=737–738 | year=1953 | accessdate=13 Feb 2007|format=PDF| issue = 4356 | bibcode=1953Natur.171..737W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, [[François Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]] demonstrated that the products of certain genes regulated the [[Gene expression|expression]] of other genes by acting upon specific sites at the edge of those genes.  They also hypothesized the existence of an intermediary between DNA and its protein products, which they called [[messenger RNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacob | first1 = F | last2 = Monod | first2 = J |name-list-format=vanc | title = Genetic regulatory mechanisms in the synthesis of proteins | url = | journal = J Mol Biol | year = 1961 | volume = 3| issue = 3 | pages = 318–356 | pmid = 13718526 | doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(61)80072-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1961 and 1965, the relationship between the information contained in DNA and the structure of proteins was determined: there is a code, the [[genetic code]], which creates a correspondence between the succession of [[nucleotide]]s in the DNA sequence and a series of [[amino acid]]s in proteins.

The chief discoveries of molecular biology took place in a period of only about twenty-five years. Another fifteen years were required before new and more sophisticated technologies, united today under the name of [[genetic engineering]], would permit the isolation and characterization of genes, in particular those of highly complex organisms.

==The exploration of the molecular dominion==
If we evaluate the molecular revolution within the context of biological history, it is easy to note that it is the culmination of a long process which began with the first observations through a microscope. The aim of these early researchers was to understand the functioning of living organisms by describing their organization at the microscopic level. From the end of the 18th century, the characterization of the chemical molecules which make up living beings gained increasingly greater attention, along with the birth of [[physiological chemistry]] in the 19th century, developed by the German chemist [[Justus von Liebig]] and following the birth of biochemistry at the beginning of the 20th, thanks to another German chemist [[Eduard Buchner]]. Between the molecules studied by chemists and the tiny structures visible under the optical microscope, such as the cellular nucleus or the chromosomes, there was an obscure zone, "the world of the ignored dimensions," as it was called by the chemical-physicist [[Wolfgang Ostwald]]. This world is populated by [[colloids]], chemical compounds whose structure and properties were not well defined.

The successes of molecular biology derived from the exploration of that unknown world by means of the new technologies developed by chemists and physicists: [[X-ray diffraction]], [[electron microscopy]], [[ultracentrifuge|ultracentrifugization]], and [[electrophoresis]]. These studies revealed the structure and function of the macromolecules.

A milestone in that process was the work of [[Linus Pauling#Molecular genetics|Dr. Linus Pauling]] in 1949, which for the first time linked the specific genetic [[mutation]] in patients with [[sickle cell disease]] to a demonstrated change in an individual protein, the [[hemoglobin]] in the [[erythrocytes]] of [[heterozygous]] or [[homozygous]] individuals.

==The encounter between biochemistry and genetics==
The development of molecular biology is also the encounter of two disciplines which made considerable progress in the course of the first thirty years of the twentieth century: biochemistry and genetics. The first studies the structure and function of the molecules which make up living things. Between 1900 and 1940, the central processes of [[metabolism]] were described: the process of [[digestion]] and the absorption of the nutritive elements derived from alimentation, such as the sugars. Every one of these processes is [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by a particular [[enzyme]]. Enzymes are proteins, like the antibodies present in blood or the proteins responsible for muscular contraction. As a consequence, the study of proteins, of their structure and synthesis, became one of the principal objectives of biochemists.

The second discipline of biology which developed at the beginning of the 20th century is genetics. After the rediscovery of the laws of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]] through the studies of [[Hugo de Vries]], [[Carl Correns]] and [[Erich von Tschermak]] in 1900, this science began to take shape thanks to the adoption by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], in 1910, of a model organism for genetic studies, the famous fruit fly (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''). Shortly after, Morgan showed that the genes are localized on chromosomes. Following this discovery, he continued working with Drosophila and, along with numerous other research groups, confirmed the importance of the gene in the life and development of organisms. Nevertheless, the chemical nature of genes and their mechanisms of action remained a mystery. Molecular biologists committed themselves to the determination of the structure, and the description of the complex relations between, genes and proteins.

The development of molecular biology was not just the fruit of some sort of intrinsic "necessity" in the history of ideas, but was a characteristically historical phenomenon, with all of its unknowns, imponderables and contingencies: the remarkable developments in physics at the beginning of the 20th century highlighted the relative lateness in development in biology, which became the "new frontier" in the search for knowledge about the empirical world. Moreover, the developments of the [[information theory|theory of information]] and [[cybernetics]] in the 1940s, in response to military exigencies, brought to the new biology a significant number of fertile ideas and, especially, metaphors.

The choice of bacteria and of its virus, the bacteriophage, as models for the study of the fundamental mechanisms of life was almost natural - they are the smallest living organisms known to exist - and at the same time the fruit of individual choices. This model owes its success, above all, to the fame and the sense of organization of [[Max Delbrück]], a German physicist, who was able to create a dynamic research group, based in the United States, whose exclusive scope was the study of the bacteriophage: the ''[[phage group]]''.&lt;ref name="phage"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/bies.201400152| title = A century of phage research: Bacteriophages and the shaping of modern biology| journal = BioEssays| volume = 37| issue = 1| pages = 6–9| year = 2015| last1 = Keen | first1 = E. C.| pmid=25521633| pmc=4418462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographic panorama of the developments of the new biology was conditioned above all by preceding work. The US, where genetics had developed the most rapidly, and the UK, where there was a coexistence of both genetics and biochemical research of highly advanced levels, were in the avant-garde. Germany, the cradle of the revolutions in physics, with the best minds and the most advanced laboratories of genetics in the world, should have had a primary role in the development of molecular biology. But history decided differently: the arrival of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in 1933 - and, to a less extreme degree, the rigidification of totalitarian measures in [[fascism|fascist]] Italy - caused the emigration of a large number of Jewish and non-Jewish scientists. The majority of them fled to the US or the UK, providing an extra impulse to the scientific dynamism of those nations. These movements ultimately made molecular biology a truly international science from the very beginnings.

==History of DNA biochemistry==

The study of DNA is a central part of molecular biology.

===First isolation of DNA===
Working in the 19th century, biochemists initially isolated DNA and RNA (mixed together) from cell nuclei. They were relatively quick to appreciate the polymeric nature of their "nucleic acid" isolates, but realized only later that nucleotides were of two types—one containing [[ribose]] and the other [[deoxyribose]]. It was this subsequent discovery that led to the identification and naming of DNA as a substance distinct from RNA.

[[Friedrich Miescher]] (1844–1895) discovered a substance he called "nuclein" in 1869. Somewhat later, he isolated a pure sample of the material now known as DNA from the sperm of salmon, and in 1889 his pupil, [[Richard Altmann]], named it "nucleic acid". This substance was found to exist only in the chromosomes.

In 1919 [[Phoebus Levene]] at the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] identified the components (the four bases, the sugar and the phosphate chain) and he showed that the components of DNA were linked in the order phosphate-sugar-base. He called each of these units a [[nucleotide]] and suggested the DNA molecule consisted of a string of nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups, which are the 'backbone' of the molecule. However Levene thought the chain was short and that the bases repeated in the same fixed order. [[Torbjörn Caspersson]] and [[Einar Hammersten]] showed that DNA was a polymer.

===Chromosomes and inherited traits===
In 1927 [[Nikolai Koltsov]]  proposed that inherited traits would be inherited via a "giant hereditary molecule" which would be made up of "two mirror strands that would replicate in a semi-conservative fashion using each strand as a template".&lt;ref name="Soyfer"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Soyfer VN |title=The consequences of political dictatorship for Russian science |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=723–9 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11533721 |doi=10.1038/35088598 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Delbrück]], [[Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky]], and [[Karl G. Zimmer]] published results in 1935 suggesting that chromosomes are very large molecules the structure of which can be changed by treatment with [[X-ray]]s, and that by so changing their structure it was possible to change the heritable characteristics governed by those chromosomes. In 1937 [[William Astbury]] produced the first [[X-ray diffraction]] patterns from DNA. He was not able to propose the correct structure but the patterns showed that DNA had a regular structure and therefore it might be possible to deduce what this structure was.

In 1943, [[Oswald Theodore Avery]] and a team of scientists discovered that traits proper to the "smooth" form of the ''Pneumococcus'' could be transferred to the "rough" form of the same bacteria merely by making the killed "smooth" (S) form available to the live "rough" (R) form. Quite unexpectedly, the living R ''Pneumococcus'' bacteria were transformed into a new strain of the S form, and the transferred S characteristics turned out to be heritable. Avery called the medium of transfer of traits the [[transforming principle]]; he identified DNA as the transforming principle, and not [[protein]] as previously thought. He essentially redid [[Frederick Griffith]]'s experiment. In 1953, [[Alfred Hershey]] and [[Martha Chase]] did an experiment ([[Hershey–Chase experiment]]) that showed, in [[T2 phage]], that DNA is the [[genetic material]] (Hershey shared the Nobel prize with Luria).

===Discovery of the structure of DNA===
In the 1950s, three groups made it their goal to determine the structure of DNA. The first group to start was at [[King's College London]] and was led by [[Maurice Wilkins]] and was later joined by [[Rosalind Franklin]]. Another group consisting of [[Francis Crick]] and [[James Watson]] was at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. A third group was at [[Caltech]] and was led by [[Linus Pauling]]. Crick and Watson built physical models using metal rods and balls, in which they incorporated the known chemical structures of the nucleotides, as well as the known position of the linkages joining one nucleotide to the next along the polymer. At King's College Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin examined [[crystallography|X-ray diffraction]] patterns of DNA fibers. Of the three groups, only the London group was able to produce good quality diffraction patterns and thus produce sufficient quantitative data about the structure.

===Helix structure===
In 1948 Pauling discovered that many proteins included helical (see [[alpha helix]]) shapes. Pauling had deduced this structure from X-ray patterns and from attempts to physically model the structures. (Pauling was also later to suggest an incorrect three chain helical DNA structure based on Astbury's data.) Even in the initial diffraction data from DNA by Maurice Wilkins, it was evident that the structure involved helices. But this insight was only a beginning. There remained the questions of how many strands came together, whether this number was the same for every helix, whether the bases pointed toward the helical axis or away, and ultimately what were the explicit angles and coordinates of all the bonds and atoms. Such questions motivated the modeling efforts of Watson and Crick.

===Complementary nucleotides===
In their modeling, Watson and Crick restricted themselves to what they saw as chemically and biologically reasonable. Still, the breadth of possibilities was very wide. A breakthrough occurred in 1952, when [[Erwin Chargaff]] visited Cambridge and inspired Crick with a description of experiments Chargaff had published in 1947. Chargaff had observed that the proportions of the four nucleotides vary between one DNA sample and the next, but that for particular pairs of nucleotides — adenine and thymine, guanine and cytosine — the two nucleotides are always present in equal proportions.

[[Image:DNA Model Crick-Watson.jpg|thumb|right|Crick and Watson DNA model built in 1953, was [http://www.farooqhussain.org/projects/ reconstructed] largely from its original pieces in 1973 and donated to the [[Science Museum, London|National Science Museum]] in London.]]

Using [[X-ray diffraction]], as well as other data from [[Rosalind Franklin]] and her information that the bases were paired, [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] arrived at the first accurate model of DNA's molecular structure in 1953, which was accepted through inspection by Rosalind Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Watson J, Crick F | title = Molecular structure of nucleic acids; a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid | url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/Y/W/_/scbbyw.pdf | journal = Nature | volume = 171 | issue = 4356 | pages = 737–8 | year = 1953 | pmid = 13054692 | doi = 10.1038/171737a0|format=PDF | bibcode=1953Natur.171..737W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery was announced on February 28, 1953; the first Watson/Crick paper appeared in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on April 25, 1953. Sir [[Lawrence Bragg]], the director of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], where Watson and Crick worked, gave a talk at [[Guy's Hospital]] Medical School in London on Thursday, May 14, 1953 which resulted in an article by [[Ritchie Calder]] in the ''[[News Chronicle]]'' of London, on Friday, May 15, 1953, entitled "Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life." The news reached readers of ''[[The New York Times]]'' the next day; Victor K. McElheny, in researching his biography, "Watson and DNA: Making a Scientific Revolution", found a clipping of a six-paragraph ''New York Times'' article written from London and dated May 16, 1953 with the headline "Form of `Life Unit' in Cell Is Scanned." The article ran in an early edition and was then pulled to make space for news deemed more important. (''The New York Times'' subsequently ran a longer article on June 12, 1953). [[Varsity (Cambridge)|The Cambridge University undergraduate newspaper]] also ran its own short article on the discovery on Saturday, May 30, 1953. Bragg's original announcement at a [[Solvay Conference]] on [[protein]]s in Belgium on 8 April 1953 went unreported by the press. In 1962 Watson, Crick, and [[Maurice Wilkins]] jointly received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their determination of the structure of DNA.

==="Central Dogma"===
Watson and Crick's model attracted great interest immediately upon its presentation. Arriving at their conclusion on February 21, 1953, Watson and Crick made their first announcement on February 28. In an influential presentation in 1957, Crick laid out the "[[central dogma of molecular biology]]", which foretold the relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins, and articulated the "sequence hypothesis." A critical confirmation of the replication mechanism that was implied by the double-helical structure followed in 1958 in the form of the [[Meselson–Stahl experiment]]. Work by Crick and coworkers showed that the genetic code was based on non-overlapping triplets of bases, called codons, and [[Har Gobind Khorana]] and others deciphered the [[genetic code]] not long afterward (1966). These findings represent the birth of [[molecular biology]].

==History of RNA tertiary structure==

===Pre-history: the helical structure of RNA===

The earliest work in RNA structural biology coincided, more or less, with the work being done on DNA in the early 1950s.  In their seminal 1953 paper, Watson and Crick suggested that van der Waals crowding by the 2`OH group of [[ribose]] would preclude RNA from adopting a double helical structure identical to the model they proposed - what we now know as B-form DNA.&lt;ref name="pmid13054692"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Watson JD, Crick FH |title=Molecular structure of nucleic acids; a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid |journal=Nature |volume=171 |issue=4356 |pages=737–738 |date=April 1953 |pmid=13054692 |doi= 10.1038/171737a0 | bibcode = 1953Natur.171..737W |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provoked questions about the three-dimensional structure of RNA: could this molecule form some type of helical structure, and if so, how?  As with DNA, early structural work on RNA centered around isolation of native RNA polymers for fiber diffraction analysis.  In part because of heterogeneity of the samples tested, early fiber diffraction patterns were usually ambiguous and not readily interpretable.  In 1955, [[Marianne Grunberg-Manago]] and colleagues published a paper describing the enzyme [[polynucleotide phosphorylase]], which cleaved a phosphate group from nucleotide diphosphates to catalyze their polymerization.&lt;ref name="pmid13274047"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grunberg-Manago M, Ortiz PJ, Ochoa S | title = Enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acidlike polynucleotides | journal = Science | volume = 122 | issue = 3176 | pages = 907–10 |date=November 1955 | pmid = 13274047 | doi = 10.1126/science.122.3176.907| url = | issn = |bibcode = 1955Sci...122..907G }}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery allowed researchers to synthesize homogenous nucleotide polymers, which they then combined to produce double stranded molecules.  These samples yielded the most readily interpretable fiber diffraction patterns yet obtained, suggesting an ordered, helical structure for cognate, double stranded RNA that differed from that observed in DNA.  These results paved the way for a series of investigations into the various properties and propensities of RNA.  Through the late 1950s and early 1960s, numerous papers were published on various topics in RNA structure, including RNA-DNA hybridization,&lt;ref name="Rich_1956"&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Rich A, Davies DR |date=July 1956 | title = A new, two-stranded helical structure: polyadenylic acid and polyuridylic acid | journal = J.

===The beginning: crystal structure of tRNA&lt;sup&gt;PHE&lt;/sup&gt;===

In the mid-1960s, the role of [[tRNA]] in protein synthesis was being intensively studied.  At this point, [[ribosomes]] had been implicated in protein synthesis, and it had been shown that an mRNA strand was necessary for the formation of these structures.  In a 1964 publication, Warner and Rich showed that ribosomes active in protein synthesis contained tRNA molecules bound at the A and P sites, and discussed the notion that these molecules aided in the [[peptidyl transferase]] reaction.&lt;ref name="pmid14215634"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Warner JR, Rich A | title = The number of soluble RNA molecules on reticulocyte polyribosomes | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In 1965, Holley ''et al.'' purified and sequenced the first tRNA molecule, initially proposing that it adopted a cloverleaf structure, based largely on the ability of certain regions of the molecule to form stem loop structures.&lt;ref name="pmid14263761"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holley, RW, Apgar, J, Everett, GA, Madison, JT, Marguisse, M, Merrill, SH, Penwick, JR, Zamir | title = Structure of a ribonucleic acid | journal = Science | volume = 147 | issue = 3664| pages = 1462–5 |date=March 1965 | pmid = 14263761 | doi = 10.1126/science.147.3664.1462| url = | issn = |bibcode = 1965Sci...147.1462H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The isolation of tRNA proved to be the first major windfall in RNA structural biology.  Following [[Robert W. Holley]]'s publication, numerous investigators began work on isolation tRNA for crystallographic study, developing improved methods for isolating the molecule as they worked.  By 1968 several groups had produced tRNA crystals, but these proved to be of limited quality and did not yield data at the resolutions necessary to determine structure.&lt;ref name="pmid4880852"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim SH, Rich A | title = Single crystals of transfer RNA: an X-ray diffraction study | journal = Science | volume = 162 | issue = 3860 | pages = 1381–4 |date=December 1968 | pmid = 4880852 | doi = 10.1126/science.162.3860.1381| url = | issn = |bibcode = 1968Sci...162.1381K }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Kim ''et al.'' achieved another breakthrough, producing crystals of yeast tRNA&lt;sup&gt;PHE&lt;/sup&gt; that diffracted to 2-3 Ångström resolutions by using [[spermine]], a naturally occurring [[polyamine]], which bound to and stabilized the tRNA.&lt;ref name="pmid5279525"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim SH, Quigley G, Suddath FL, Rich A | title = High-resolution x-ray diffraction patterns of crystalline transfer RNA that show helical regions | journal = Proc.

In 1973, Kim ''et al.'' produced a 4 Ångström map of the tRNA molecule in which they could unambiguously trace the entire backbone.&lt;ref name="pmid4566654"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim SH, Quigley GJ, Suddath FL, McPherson A, Sneden D, Kim JJ, Weinzierl J, Rich A | title = Three-dimensional structure of yeast phenylalanine transfer RNA: folding of the polynucleotide chain | journal = Science | volume = 179 | issue = 4070 | pages = 285–8 |date=January 1973 | pmid = 4566654 | doi = 10.1126/science.179.4070.285| url = | issn = | bibcode=1973Sci...179..285K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This solution would be followed by many more, as various investigators worked to refine the structure and thereby more thoroughly elucidate the details of base pairing and stacking interactions, and validate the published architecture of the molecule.

The tRNA&lt;sup&gt;PHE&lt;/sup&gt; structure is notable in the field of nucleic acid structure in general, as it represented the first solution of a long-chain nucleic acid structure of any kind - RNA or DNA - preceding [[Richard E. Dickerson]]'s solution of a B-form dodecamer by nearly a decade.&lt;ref name="pmid6941276"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Drew HR, Wing RM, Takano T, Broka C, Tanaka S, Itakura K, Dickerson RE | title = Structure of a B-DNA dodecamer: conformation and dynamics | journal = Proc.

===The renaissance: the hammerhead ribozyme and the group I intron: P&lt;sub&gt;4-6&lt;/sub&gt;===

For a considerable time following the first tRNA structures, the field of RNA structure did not dramatically advance.  The ability to study an RNA structure depended upon the potential to isolate the RNA target.  This proved limiting to the field for many years, in part because other known targets - i.e., the ribosome - were significantly more difficult to isolate and crystallize.  Further, because other interesting RNA targets had simply not been identified, or were not sufficiently understood to be deemed interesting, there was simply a lack of things to study structurally.  As such, for some twenty years following the original publication of the tRNA&lt;sup&gt;PHE&lt;/sup&gt; structure, the structures of only a handful of other RNA targets were solved, with almost all of these belonging to the transfer RNA family.&lt;ref name="pmid7544309"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shen LX, Cai Z, Tinoco I | title = RNA structure at high resolution | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1023–33 |date=August 1995 | pmid = 7544309 | doi = | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This unfortunate lack of scope would eventually be overcome largely because of two major advancements in nucleic acid research: the identification of [[ribozymes]], and the ability to produce them via ''in vitro'' transcription.

This structure was followed by [[Jennifer Doudna]]'s publication of the structure of the P4-P6 domains of the ''Tetrahymena'' group I intron, a fragment of the ribozyme originally made famous by Cech.&lt;ref name="Cate96"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cate JH, Gooding AR, Podell E, Zhou K, Golden BL, Kundrot CE, Cech TR, Doudna JA | title = Crystal structure of a group I ribozyme domain: principles of RNA packing | journal = Science | volume = 273 | issue = 5282 | pages = 1678–85 |date=September 1996 | pmid = 8781224 | doi = 10.1126/science.273.5282.1678| url = | issn = |bibcode = 1996Sci...273.1678C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second clause in the title of this publication - ''Principles of RNA Packing'' - concisely evinces the value of these two structures: for the first time, comparisons could be made between well described tRNA structures and those of globular RNAs outside the transfer family.  This allowed the framework of categorization to be built for RNA tertiary structure.  It was now possible to propose the conservation of motifs, folds, and various local stabilizing interactions.  For an early review of these structures and their implications, see ''RNA FOLDS: Insights from recent crystal structures'', by Doudna and Ferre-D'Amare.&lt;ref name="pmid10410795"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ferré-D'Amaré AR, Doudna JA | title = RNA folds: insights from recent crystal structures | journal = Annu Rev Biophys Biomol Struct | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 57–73 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10410795 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.28.1.57 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the advances being made in global structure determination via crystallography, the early 1990s also saw the implementation of [[NMR]] as a powerful technique in RNA structural biology.  Coincident with the large-scale ribozyme structures being solved crystallographically, a number of structures of small RNAs and RNAs complexed with drugs and peptides were solved using NMR.&lt;ref name="pmid9204272"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramos A, Gubser CC, Varani G | title = Recent solution structures of RNA and its complexes with drugs, peptides and proteins | journal = Curr.

The importance of understanding RNA tertiary structural motifs was prophetically well described by Michel and Costa in their publication identifying the [[tetraloop]] motif: "..it should not come as a surprise if self-folding RNA molecules were to make intensive use of only a relatively small set of tertiary motifs.  Identifying these motifs would greatly aid modeling enterprises, which will remain essential as long as the crystallization of large RNAs remains a difficult task".&lt;ref name="pmid7720718"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Costa M, Michel F | title = Frequent use of the same tertiary motif by self-folding RNAs | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 1276–85 |date=March 1995 | pmid = 7720718 | pmc = 398207 | doi = | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The modern era: the age of RNA structural biology===

The resurgence of RNA structural biology in the mid-1990s has caused a veritable explosion in the field of nucleic acid structural research.  Since the publication of the hammerhead and P&lt;sub&gt;4-6&lt;/sub&gt; structures, numerous major contributions to the field have been made.  Some of the most noteworthy examples include the structures of the [[group I intron|Group I]] and [[Group II intron]]s,&lt;ref name="Toor08"&gt;{{PDB|3BWP}}; {{cite journal |vauthors=Toor N, Keating KS, Taylor SD, Pyle AM | title = Crystal structure of a self-spliced group II intron | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5872 | pages = 77–82 |date=April 2008 | pmid = 18388288 | doi = 10.1126/science.1153803 | url = | issn = |bibcode = 2008Sci...320...77T | pmc = 4406475 }}; rendered with [http://pymol.sourceforge.net PyMOL]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ribosome]] solved by [[Nenad Ban]] and colleagues in the laboratory of [[Thomas Steitz]].&lt;ref name="pmid10937989"&gt;{{PDB|1FFK}}; {{cite journal |vauthors=Ban N, Nissen P, Hansen J, Moore PB, Steitz TA | title = The complete atomic structure of the large ribosomal subunit at 2.4 A resolution | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = 5481 | pages = 905–20 |date=August 2000 | pmid = 10937989 | doi = 10.1126/science.289.5481.905| url = | issn = |bibcode = 2000Sci...289..905B }}; rendered with [http://pymol.sourceforge.net PyMOL]&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that the first three structures were produced using ''in vitro'' transcription, and that NMR has played a role in investigating partial components of all four structures - testaments to the indispensability of both techniques for RNA research.  Most recently, the 2009 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] was awarded to [[Ada Yonath]], [[Venkatraman Ramakrishnan]] and [[Thomas Steitz]] for their structural work on the ribosome, demonstrating the prominent role RNA structural biology has taken in modern molecular biology.

==History of protein biochemistry==

===First isolation and classification===
Proteins were recognized as a distinct class of biological molecules in the eighteenth century by [[Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy|Antoine Fourcroy]] and others.  Members of this class (called the "albuminoids", ''Eiweisskörper'', or ''matières albuminoides'') were recognized by their ability to [[coagulate]] or [[flocculation|flocculate]] under various treatments such as heat or acid; well-known examples at the start of the nineteenth century included albumen from [[egg white]]s, [[blood]] [[serum albumin]], [[fibrin]], and [[wheat]] [[gluten]]. The similarity between the cooking of egg whites and the curdling of milk was recognized even in ancient times; for example, the name ''albumen'' for the egg-white protein was coined by [[Pliny the Elder]] from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''albus ovi'' (egg white).

With the advice of [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], the Dutch chemist [[Gerhardus Johannes Mulder]] carried out [[elemental analysis|elemental analyses]] of common animal and plant proteins.  To everyone's surprise, all proteins had nearly the same [[empirical formula]], roughly C&lt;sub&gt;400&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;620&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;120&lt;/sub&gt; with individual sulfur and phosphorus atoms.  Mulder published his findings in two papers (1837,1838) and hypothesized that there was one basic substance (''Grundstoff'') of proteins, and that it was synthesized by plants and absorbed from them by animals in digestion.  Berzelius was an early proponent of this theory and proposed the name "protein" for this substance in a letter dated 10 July 1838

&lt;blockquote&gt;The name protein that he propose for the organic oxide of [[fibrin]] and [[albumin]], I wanted to derive from [the [[Greek language|Greek]] word] πρωτειος, because it appears to be the primitive or principal substance of animal nutrition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!--: «Le nom protéine que je vous propose pour l’oxyde organique de la fibrine et de l’albumine, je voulais le dériver de πρωτειος, parce qu’il paraît être la substance primitive ou principale de la nutrition animale.»--&gt;

Mulder went on to identify the products of protein degradation such as the  [[amino acid]], [[leucine]], for which he found a (nearly correct) molecular weight of 131 [[atomic mass unit|Da]].

===Purifications and measurements of mass===

The minimum molecular weight suggested by Mulder's analyses was roughly 9 [[atomic mass unit|kDa]], hundreds of times larger than other molecules being studied.  Hence, the chemical structure of proteins (their [[primary structure]]) was an active area of research until 1949, when [[Fred Sanger]] sequenced [[insulin]].  The (correct) theory that proteins were linear polymers of [[amino acid]]s linked by [[peptide bond]]s was proposed independently and simultaneously by [[Franz Hofmeister]] and [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] at the same conference in 1902.  However, some scientists were sceptical that such long [[macromolecule]]s could be stable in solution.  Consequently, numerous alternative theories of the protein [[primary structure]] were proposed, e.g., the colloidal hypothesis that proteins were assemblies of small molecules, the [[cyclol]] hypothesis of [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Dorothy Wrinch]], the diketopiperazine hypothesis of [[Emil Abderhalden]] and the pyrrol/piperidine hypothesis of Troensgard (1942).  Most of these theories had difficulties in accounting for the fact that the  digestion of proteins yielded [[peptide]]s and [[amino acid]]s.  
Proteins were finally shown to be macromolecules of well-defined composition (and not colloidal mixtures) by [[Theodor Svedberg]] using [[analytical ultracentrifugation]].  The possibility that some proteins are non-covalent associations of such macromolecules was shown by [[Gilbert Smithson Adair]] (by measuring the [[osmotic pressure]] of [[hemoglobin]]) and, later, by [[Frederic M. Richards]] in his studies of ribonuclease S.  The [[mass spectrometry]] of proteins has long been a useful technique for identifying [[posttranslational modification]]s and, more recently, for probing protein structure.

Most proteins are difficult to [[protein purification|purify]] in more than milligram quantities, even using the most modern methods.  Hence, early studies focused on proteins that could be purified in large quantities, e.g., those of [[blood]], [[egg white]], various [[toxin]]s, and digestive/metabolic enzymes obtained from [[slaughterhouse]]s.  Many techniques of protein purification were developed during [[World War II]] in a project led by [[Edwin Joseph Cohn]] to purify blood proteins to help keep soldiers alive.  In the late 1950s, the [[Armour and Company|Armour Hot Dog Co.]] purified 1&amp;nbsp;kg (= one million milligrams) of pure bovine pancreatic [[ribonuclease A]] and made it freely available to scientists around the world.  This generous act made RNase A the main protein for basic research for the next few decades, resulting in several Nobel Prizes.

===Protein folding and first structural models===

The study of protein folding began in 1910 with a famous paper by Harriette Chick and C. J. Martin, in which they showed that the [[flocculation]] of a protein was composed of two distinct processes: the [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of a protein from solution was ''preceded'' by another process called [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]], in which the protein became much less soluble, lost its enzymatic activity and became more chemically reactive.  In the mid-1920s, [[Mortimer Louis Anson|Tim Anson]] and [[Alfred Mirsky]] proposed that denaturation was a reversible process, a correct hypothesis that was initially lampooned by some scientists as "unboiling the egg".  Anson also suggested that denaturation was a two-state ("all-or-none") process, in which one fundamental molecular transition resulted in the drastic changes in solubility, enzymatic activity and chemical reactivity; he further noted that the free energy changes upon denaturation were much smaller than those typically involved in chemical reactions.  In 1929, [[Hsien Wu]] hypothesized that denaturation was protein unfolding, a purely conformational change that resulted in the exposure of amino acid side chains to the solvent.  According to this (correct) hypothesis, exposure of aliphatic and reactive side chains to solvent rendered the protein less soluble and more reactive, whereas the loss of a specific conformation caused the loss of enzymatic activity.  Although considered plausible, Wu's hypothesis was not immediately accepted, since so little was known of protein structure and enzymology and other factors could account for the changes in solubility, enzymatic activity and chemical reactivity.  In the early 1960s, [[Christian B. Anfinsen|Chris Anfinsen]] showed that the folding of [[ribonuclease A]] was fully reversible with no external cofactors needed, verifying the "thermodynamic hypothesis" of protein folding that the folded state represents the global minimum of [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] for the protein.

The hypothesis of protein folding was followed by research into the physical interactions that stabilize folded protein structures.  The crucial role of [[hydrophobic interaction]]s was hypothesized by [[Dorothy Maud Wrinch|Dorothy Wrinch]] and [[Irving Langmuir]], as a mechanism that might stabilize her [[cyclol]] structures.  Although supported by [[J. D. Bernal]] and others, this (correct) hypothesis was rejected along with the cyclol hypothesis, which was disproven in the 1930s by [[Linus Pauling]] (among others). Instead, Pauling championed the idea that protein structure was stabilized mainly by [[hydrogen bond]]s, an idea advanced initially by [[William Astbury]] (1933).  Remarkably, Pauling's incorrect theory about H-bonds resulted in his ''correct'' models for the [[secondary structure]] elements of proteins, the [[alpha helix]] and the [[beta sheet]].  The hydrophobic interaction was restored to its correct prominence by a famous article in 1959 by [[Walter Kauzmann]] on [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]], based partly on work by [[Kaj Ulrik Linderstrøm-Lang|Kaj Linderstrøm-Lang]].  The ionic nature of proteins was demonstrated by Bjerrum, Weber and [[Arne Tiselius]], but Linderstrom-Lang showed that the charges were generally accessible to solvent and not bound to each other (1949).

The [[secondary structure|secondary]] and low-resolution [[tertiary structure]] of globular proteins was investigated initially by hydrodynamic methods, such as [[analytical ultracentrifugation]] and [[flow birefringence]].  Spectroscopic methods to probe protein structure (such as [[circular dichroism]], fluorescence, near-ultraviolet and infrared absorbance) were developed in the 1950s.  The first atomic-resolution structures of proteins were solved by [[X-ray crystallography]] in the 1960s and by [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] in the 1980s.   {{As of|2006}}, the [[Protein Data Bank]] has nearly 40,000 atomic-resolution structures of proteins.  In more recent times, [[cryo-electron microscopy]] of large [[macromolecular assemblies]] and computational [[protein structure prediction]] of small protein [[structural domain|domains]] are two methods approaching atomic resolution.

A '''holistic community''' (also referred to as closed or unitary) is an [[ecosystem]] where the species within the community are [[interdependent]] on each other for keeping balance and stability of the system. These communities are described as working like a [[superorganism]], meaning that every species plays an important part in the overall well being of the [[ecosystem]] in which the community resides; much like the [[organelle]]s within a cell, or even the cells making up one organism. Holistic communities have diffused boundaries, and an independent species range. [[Co-evolution]] is likely to be found in communities structured after this model, as a result of the interdependence and high rates of interaction found among the different populations. It is said that species compositions of communities change sharply at environmental edges (known as [[ecotones]]).

==Background==
The ideas of a holistic community were introduced by [[plant ecologist]] [[Frederic Clements]] in 1916. These notions were countered by [[Henry Gleason]] in 1917, when he proposed the [[individualistic/open community]] concept (in applications to plants). Neither of these ecological concepts have been found to exist in entirety, both are theories which can be applied to communities. For example, a community's composition can be better explained by holism than individualism, or vice versa. This ecological concept is based on the broader concept of [[holism]], which describes the functionality of any system as having many individual parts, all of which are extremely important to the system's viability.

"A community has been viewed as a superorganism with an integrity analogous to that of cells in an organism. This is the holistic or unitary view of a community, and one championed by Clements (1916). He regarded the community to be a highly integrated unit that operated very much within itself with little interaction with surrounding communities - a closed community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gA2xfP8hHlEC&amp;pg=PA296 |title=Tropical Ecosystems and Ecological Concepts|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">The '''India State Hunger Index''' ('''ISHI''') is a tool to calculate [[hunger]] and [[malnutrition]] at the regional level in [[India]]. It is constructed in the same fashion as the [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI) 2008 and was calculated for 17 states in India, covering more than 95 percent of the population. 

The ISHI was developed by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) and presented for the first time 2008 in conjunction with the [[Non-Governmental Organization]] [[Welthungerhilfe]] and the Department of Economics, [[University of California]].

== Background ==

Despite the good economic performance, with over 200 million people who are [[food security|food insecure]], India is home to the largest number of hungry people in the world. In the ranking of the [[Global Hunger Index]] 2017 it covers position 100 out of 119 ranked countries and has an “serious“ (31.4) [[food security]] situation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ishi08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The major problem in the country is the high prevalence of [[underweight]] children under five, which is a result of low nutrition and educational status of women. 

While there has been attention to hunger and [[undernourishment]] at the central level, within India's political system, states are important political units with regard to the planning and execution of development programs. Thus unpacking the hunger index at the level of the  federal states is an important tool to build awareness of the disparities in hunger among them. In addition, the variability of the relative contribution of the underlying components of the hunger index across the different Indian states can help to stimulate the discussion about the drivers of hunger in different state contexts.

==Indicators and underlying data==

The ISHI is constructed in the same fashion as the [[Global Hunger Index]] which follows a multidimensional approach to measuring hunger and [[malnutrition]]. It combines three equally weighted indicators:

# the proportion of undernourished as a percentage of the population (reflecting the share of the population with insufficient dietary intake);
# the prevalence of [[underweight]] children under the age of five (indicating the proportion of children suffering from weight loss and / or reduced growth); and 
# the [[child mortality|mortality rate of children]] under the age of five (partially reflecting the fatal synergy between dietary intake and unhealthy environments).

The ISHI uses two data sources for the estimation of the Indian state level: These are the first rounds of the National Family Health Survey (2005–2006) for India and the National Sample Survey data from 2004 to 2005. It is calculated and presented for 17 major states, covering 95 percent of the country's population. While the National Family Health Survey has a large enough sample size to yield representative estimates of the child [[underweight]] and mortality rates even for the smaller states and union territories in the country, the sample size of the National Sample Survey is insufficient for estimating undernourishment rates in these places. Therefore, the ISHI restricts the sample to those states for which it yields precise states level estimates.

== Key findings ==

*ISHI 2008 scores for Indian states range from 13.6 (“serious”) for [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] to 30.9 (“extremely alarming”) for [[Madhya Pradesh]], indicating substantial variability among states in India. Punjab is ranked 34th when compared to the GHI 2008 worldwide country ranking, while Madhya Pradesh is ranked 82nd. In this state more people suffer from hunger than in Ethiopia or Sudan. 60 percent of the children are undernourished.
*All 17 states have ISHI scores that are well above the “low” and “moderate” hunger categories. Twelve of the 17 states fall into the “alarming” category, and one into the “extremely alarming” category.
*ISHI scores are closely aligned with poverty, but there is little association with state level economic growth. High levels of hunger are seen in states that are performing well from an economic perspective.
*Inclusive economic growth and targeted strategies to ensure food sufficiency reduce child mortality and improve child nutrition are urgent priorities for all states in India.

[[File:Priestley.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Priestley by [[Ellen Sharples]] (1794)&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, ''Iconography'', 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Joseph Priestley]] ({{OldStyleDate|24 March|1733|13 March}} &amp;ndash; 8 February 1804) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[natural philosopher]], [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] [[clergyman]], [[Political philosophy|political theorist]], and [[theologian]]. While his achievements in all of these areas are renowned, he was also dedicated to improving education in Britain; he did this on an individual level and through his support of the [[Dissenting academies]]. His [[grammar]] textbook was innovative and highly influential. More importantly, though, Priestley introduced a [[liberal arts]] curriculum at [[Warrington Academy]], arguing that a practical education would be more useful to students than a classical one. He was also the first to advocate the study and teaching of [[Historiography#Modern historiography|modern history]], an interest driven by his belief that humanity was improving and could bring about [[Millennialism|Christ's Millennium]].

==Personal and institutional teaching==
Priestley was a teacher in one way or another throughout his entire adult life. Once he discovered how much he enjoyed teaching, he consistently returned to this calling. At the school he established in [[Nantwich]], [[Cheshire]], he taught a wide range of topics to the town's children: [[Latin]] (and perhaps Greek), [[History of geography#Marco Polo to the 18th century|geography]], [[mathematics]], and [[English grammar]]. Unusually for the time, he also taught [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 77-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of this school, he was offered the position of tutor of modern languages and rhetoric at [[Warrington Academy]]. In later years, when he lived in [[Leeds]] and [[Birmingham]], he created classes for the youth of his parishes; in Birmingham his three classes totaled 150 students and he helped organize the New Meeting [[Sunday school]]s for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 242-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having received an excellent education at Daventry, a [[Dissenting academies|Dissenting academy]], and convinced that education was the key to shaping people and the world's future, Priestley continued to support the Dissenting academies throughout his life. For example, he advised the founders of [[New College at Hackney]] on its curriculum and preached a charity sermon on the "proper Objects of Education" to help raise money for the school. After emigrating to America in 1794, Priestley continued the educational projects that had always been important to him. He attempted to find funding for the Northumberland Academy and donated his library to it, but the academy did not open until 1813 and closed soon after. He communicated with [[Thomas Jefferson]] regarding the proper organization of a university and when Jefferson founded the [[University of Virginia]], it was Priestley's curricular principles that dominated the school. Jefferson also passed Priestley's advice on to [[James Madison (Episcopal Bishop)|Bishop James Madison]], whose [[College of William &amp; Mary]] also followed Priestley's maxims.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 339-343.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wherever Priestley went, he also instructed people in [[natural philosophy]]. In Nantwich, he bought scientific instruments, such as a [[microscope]], for the school, and encouraged his students to give public presentations of their experiments. In [[Calne]], where he was a tutor to the son of [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]], Priestley convinced his patron to buy expensive equipment with which to teach his son the fundamentals of natural philosophy. He wrote in his ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]'' (1778), published during these years, that children should not only be educated in the ancient subjects of rhetoric and grammar but should also become acquainted with science early in their lives since scientific understanding underpins the progress of the human race.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 14; Schofield, Vol. 2, 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Priestley moved to Birmingham in 1780, he encouraged the town's children to play with his apparatus and ask questions about his laboratory: the Priestley home became a place of scientific education for the town's children. Priestley's rain gauge and "perambulator" (a wheelbarrow for recording distances) delighted them. The boys often played with his air-gun, aiming at a wig of Priestley's which he had fastened to a post. Priestley designed [[magic lantern]] shows for them and shocked them with his electrical machine.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 245-6; Gibbs, 140; Uglow, 319-20; 407; Jackson, 227-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational philosophy==
In 1765, Priestley dedicated his ''[[Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life]]'' (1765),&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life]]''. London: Printed for C. Henderson under the Royal Exchange; T. Becket and De Hondt in the Strand; and by J. Johnson and Davenport, in Pater-Noster-Row, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; to the governing board of Warrington Academy. In it he argues that young people's education should anticipate their practical needs, something he accused the current universities, Dissenting and Establishment alike, of failing to do. In Priestley's eyes, the contemporary focus on a traditional [[classics|classical education]] prevented students from acquiring useful skills. This principle of utility guided his unusual curricular recommendations. He proposed that students study English and the modern languages instead of the classical languages, learn practical mathematics, read modern rather than ancient history, and study the constitution and laws of England. He believed that these topics would prepare his students for the commercial middle-class life that most of them would live; he did not believe that the poor should receive this same education, arguing "it could be of no service to their country, and often a real detriment to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766 Warrington Academy replaced its old classical curriculum with Priestley's new [[liberal arts]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, 52-4; Schofield, Vol. 1, 124-5; Watts, 95-7; Sheps, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars of education have argued that this work and his later ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]'' (1778) (often reprinted with the ''Essay on Education'')&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]. More especially, as it respects the conduct of the mind''. Bath: Printed by R. Cruttwell; London: J. Johnson, 1778.&lt;/ref&gt; made Priestley the "most considerable English writer on educational philosophy" between [[John Locke]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 121; see also Watts, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
[[File:PriestleyGrammar.png|left|upright|thumb|Title page from the first edition of Priestley's ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar|Rudiments]]'' (1761)]]
Priestley's first successful educational venture was the establishment of a local school in [[Nantwich]]. Believing that all students should have a good grasp of the [[English language]] and its [[Grammar#History|grammar]] before learning any other language and dismayed at the quality of the instruction manuals available, Priestley wrote his own textbook: ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar]]'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar]]; adapted to the use of schools. With observations on style''. London: Printed for R. Griffiths, 1761.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was very successful—it was reprinted for over fifty years. Its humor may have contributed to its popularity; for example, Priestley illustrated the ''[[couplet]]'' with this rhyme:

::Beneath this stone my wife doth lie:
::She's now at rest, and so am I.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Jackson, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley also quoted from the most famous English authors, encouraging the middle-class association between reading and pleasure, a reading that would also, Priestley hoped, foster morality. Priestley's innovations in the teaching and description of English grammar, particularly his efforts to disassociate it from Latin grammar, made his textbook revolutionary and have led twentieth-century scholars to describe him as "one of the great grammarians of his time."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield, Vol. 1, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rudiments'' influenced all of the major grammarians of the late eighteenth century: [[Robert Lowth]], [[James Harris (grammarian)|James Harris]], [[John Horne Tooke]] and even the American [[Noah Webster]]. The resounding success of Priestley's book was one of the reasons that [[Warrington Academy]] offered him a teaching position in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 83-5; 99-100; Jackson, 52; Gibbs, 16; Watts, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Priestley's philosophy was founded on the fervent belief that a thorough understanding of history was necessary not only to worldly success but also to spiritual growth.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 135; 149.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "my view was, not merely to make history intelligible to persons who may choose to read it for amusement, but .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. to facilitate its subserviency to the highest uses to which it can be applied: to contribute to its forming the able statesman and the intelligent and useful citizen."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan, 253.&lt;/ref&gt; His abiding interest in history, particularly [[Historiography#Modern historiography|modern history]], sets Priestley apart from his contemporaries. Priestley was the first person to advocate the serious study of modern history; no other British university was teaching the subject at the time and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] would not begin until 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Warrington Academy, Priestley gave a series of lectures on history and government; in 1788 he finally published them as ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''. Need first edition publication information.&lt;/ref&gt; They cover a wide array of topics—"forms of government, the feudal system, the rise of corporations, law, agriculture, commerce, the arts, finance and taxation, colonies, manners, population, war and peace"—demonstrating how all-encompassing Priestley believed the study of history to be.&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text, he narrates a version of history in which all events are "an exhibition of the ways of God;" studying history and nature, according to Priestley, "leads us to the knowledge of his perfections and of his will."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding history thus allows one to comprehend the natural laws God established and the perfection towards which they allow the world to tend. This [[Millennialism|millennial]] outlook is tied together with Priestley's belief in scientific progress and the improvement of the human race. Priestley maintained that each age improves upon the previous one and studying history allows people to see and participate in that progress.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Essay on the First Principles of Government]]'' (1768) he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Highly as we think of the ''wisdom of our ancestors'' we justly think of ourselves, of the present age, wiser and . . . must see that we can . . . improve upon institutions that have been transmitted to us. Let us not doubt but that every generation in posterity will be as much superior to us in political, and all kinds of knowledge, and that they will be able to improve upon the best civil and religious institutions that we can prescribe for them. [Priestley's emphasis]&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This millennial conception of history was in direct contrast to the two dominant historical paradigms of the time: [[Edward Gibbon|Edward Gibbon's]] decline narrative found in his ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' and [[David Hume|David Hume's]] cyclical narrative found in his ''[[History of England (Hume)|History of England]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Gibbon and Hume, Priestley did not limit himself to narrating a version of history in these ''Lectures''; he also presented a method for historical research and was one of the first to argue for the primacy of original documents in the study of history. He also contended that much could be learned from "material evidence" of former civilizations, such as "ancient coins, medals and inscriptions," as well as "exchequer rolls, public and private ledger books, letters, diaries, monetary, financial and exchange systems, systems of fortifications and city plans . . . [in addition to] ballads and works of fiction."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 254-5; McLachlan, 256; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as the Dissenting academy at Hackney,&lt;!-- Is New College at Hackney the same as [[Homerton College, Cambridge]]? --&gt; [[Brown University|Brown]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 259; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory underpinning Priestley's [[millennialism|millennial]] view of history and his educational philosophy, was [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley's]] theory of association. Hartley's [[Association of Ideas|associationism]], an expansion of [[John Locke|John Locke's]] theories in ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) and laid out in ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749), postulated that the human mind operated according to natural laws and that the most important law for the formation of the self was "associationism." For Hartley, associationism was a physical process: vibrations in the physical world traveled through the nerves attached to people's sense organs and ended up in their brains. The brain connected the vibrations of whatever sensory input it was receiving with whatever feelings or ideas that the brain was simultaneously "thinking." These "associations" were impossible to avoid, formed as they were simply by experiencing the world; they were also the foundation of a person's character. Locke famously warns against letting "a foolish maid" convince a child that "goblins and sprites" are associated with the darkness, for "darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Ed. [[Roger Woolhouse]]. New York: Penguin Books (1997), 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Associationism provided the scientific basis for Priestley's belief that man is "perfectible" and served as the foundation for all of his pedagogical innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 87; 93; Sheps, 137-9; 147-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Priestley viewed education as one of the primary forces shaping a person's character as well as the basis of morality, he, unusually for his time, promoted the education of women. Alluding to the language of Locke's ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', he wrote: "certainly, the minds of women are capable of the same improvement, and the same furniture, as those of men."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Watts, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that if women were to care for children and be intellectually stimulating companions for their husbands, they had to be well-educated. Although Priestley advocated education for middle-class women, he did not extend this logic to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charts of biography and history===
[[File:PriestleyChart.gif|thumb|right|A redacted version of Priestley's ''Chart of Biography'' (1765)]]
As a supplement to his lectures on history, Priestley also designed and published ''[[A Chart of Biography]]'' (1765)&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[A Chart of Biography]]''. London: J. Johnson, St. Paul's Church Yard, 1765 and Joseph Priestley, ''A description of a chart of biography''. [Warrington] : Printed at Warrington, 1764; ''A Description of a Chart of Biography''. Warrington: Printed by William Eyres, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''New Chart of History'' (1769) (which he dedicated to [[Benjamin Franklin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[A New Chart of History]]''. London: Engraved and published for J. Johnson, 1769; ''A Description of a New Chart of History''. London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1770.&lt;/ref&gt; These charts and their accompanying ''Descriptions'' would allow students, Priestley said, to "trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 141-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chart of Biography'' covers a vast timespan, from 1200 BC to 1800 AD, and includes two thousand names. Priestley organized his list into six categories: Statesman and Warriors; Divines and Metaphysicians; Mathematicians and Physicians (natural philosophers were placed here); Poets and Artists; Orators and Critics (prose fiction authors were placed here); and Historians and Antiquarians (lawyers were placed here). Priestley's "principle of selection" was fame, not merit; therefore, as he mentions, the chart is a reflection of current opinion. He also wanted to ensure that his readers would recognize the entires on the chart. Priestley had difficulty assigning his all of his people to individual categories; he attempted to list them in the category under which their most important work had been done. [[Machiavelli]] is therefore listed as a historian rather than a statesman and [[Cicero]] is listed as a statesman instead of an orator. The chart was also arranged in order of importance; "statesmen are placed on the lower margin, where they are easier to see, because they are the names most familiar to readers."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 253; Sheps, 142-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chart of History'' lists events in 106 separate locations; it illustrates Priestley's belief that the entire world's history was significant, a relatively new development in the eighteenth century, which had begun with [[Voltaire]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]. The world's history is divided up into the following geographical categories: Scandinavia, Poland, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, France, Italy, Turkey in Europe, Turkey in Asia, Germany, Persia, India, China, Africa and America. Priestley aimed to show the history of empires and the passing of power; the subtitle of the ''Description'' that accompanied the chart was "A View of the Principle Revolutions of Empire that have taken place in the World" and he wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The capital use [of the ''Charts'' was as] a most excellent mechanical help to the knowledge of history, impressing the imagination indelibly with a just image of the rise, progress, extent, duration, and contemporary state of all the considerable empires that have ever existed in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As Arthur Sheps in his article about the ''Charts'' explains, "the horizontal line conveys an idea of the duration of fame, influence, power and domination. A vertical reading conveys an impression of the contemporaneity of ideas, events and people. The number or density of entries . . . tells us about the vitality of any age."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Voids in the chart indicated intellectual Dark Ages, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Charts'' were popular for decades—the ''[[A New Chart of History]]'' went through fifteen editions by 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the [[University of Edinburgh]] to grant him a [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor of Law degree]] in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 118-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious education==
[[File:PriestleyInstitutes.png|left|thumb|upright|Title page from the second edition of ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]'']]
Priestley pondered what form the best religious education would take throughout his life. In the 1760s, when he was a student at [[Daventry Academy]], he imbibed the pedagogical principles of its founder, [[Philip Doddridge]]; although he was dead, Doddridge's emphasis on academic rigor and freedom of thought lived on at the school and impressed Priestley. These ideals would always be a part of Priestley's educational programs. He began writing one of these while still at Daventry, the ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]''. Need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he did not publish the work until 1772, when he was at [[Leeds]]. In an effort to increase and stabilize membership at his church there, he taught three religious education classes. He subdivided the young people of the congregation into three categories: young men from 18-30 to whom he taught "the elements of natural and revealed religion" (young women may or may not be included in this group); children under 14 to whom he taught "the first elements of religious knowledge by way of a short catechism in the plainest and most familiar language possible"; and "an intermediate class" to whom he taught "knowledge of the Scriptures only."&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 170; Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the later [[Sunday school]]s established by [[Robert Raikes]], Priestley aimed his classes at middle-class Rational Dissenters; he wanted to teach them "the principles of natural religion and the evidences and doctrine of revelation in a regular and systematic course," something their parents could not provide.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley wrote texts for the courses he envisioned: ''A Catechism for Children and Young Persons'' (1767), which went through eleven English-language editions;&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A catechism for children, and young persons''. Need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Scripture Catechism, consisting of a Series of Questions, with References to the Scriptures instead of Answers'' (1772), which went through six British editions by 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A scripture catechism, consisting of a series of questions, with references to the scriptures instead of answers''. need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; He aimed to write non-sectarian ''Catechisms'', but in this he failed. He offended many orthodox readers by focusing on God's benevolence instead of on Adam's sin and Christ's atonement. Priestley implemented this same system of religious instruction over a decade later in [[Birmingham]], when he became a minister at New Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 170-1; Gibbs, 37; Watts, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in [[London, Ontario]], Canada, the [[Library and information science|Library and Information Science]] (LIS) program at the [[University of Western Ontario]] (also referred to as Western University) offers both Masters and PhD level programs through the [[Faculty of Information &amp; Media Studies (University of Western Ontario)|Faculty of Information and Media Studies (FIMS)]].&lt;ref name="Western2016f"&gt;Western University. (2016). [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/ Graduate Programs]&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Master of Library and Information Science|Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS)]] program is one of seven Canadian MLIS programs currently accredited by the [[American Library Association]] (ALA).&lt;ref name="ALA2016"&gt;[[American Library Association]]. (2016). [http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/directory/historicallist "Accredited Library and Information Studies Master's Programs from 1925 through Present"]&lt;/ref&gt; Both the PhD and Masters programs in Library and Information Sciences at Western FIMS emphasize research skills development, engagement with professional literature, information technology learning, and professional career preparedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/|title=Master of Library &amp; Information Science (MLIS)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/phd_library_information_science/|title=PhD in Library &amp; Information Science (PhD LIS)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== School of Library and Information Science (SLIS) (1966-1992) ===
The Library and Information Science (LIS) program at the University of Western Ontario was established in 1966 as the School of Library and Information Science (SLIS). In response to a shortage of professional librarians in Canada in the 1960s, the [[Government of Ontario|Ontario government]] set up a committee to investigate the creation of a new library school.&lt;ref name="White2004"&gt;White, Janette. (2004). University of Western Ontario Faculty of Information and Media Studies Library and Information Science Program.[http://www.exlibris.ca/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:newsletters:elan_special_summer_2004.pdf "ELAN: Ex Libris Association Newsletter, Special Issue, Summer 2004"], 22-26. Toronto: Ex Libris Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Delbridge Osborn, the SLIS's first dean, decided the SLIS would have its own library operating outside of the University of Western Ontario's library system in order to support library instruction and research. Generous funding allowed the SLIS to establish their general and special collections, including rare books and materials to support specialized coursework.&lt;ref name="Dorner1990"&gt;Dorner, Daniel G. (1990). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4308478 "The School of Library and Information Science Library, University of Western Ontario"], ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'', 60(3), 232-243.&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Western Ontario's MLS program officially began in September 1967 with 40 full-time and 20 part-time students.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;

=== Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) (1993-1995) ===
The University of Western Ontario's School of Library and Information Science (SLIS) was renamed to the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) in 1993.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt; The new name reflected the change in the school's degree designation from Master of Library Science (MLS) to Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS), which occurred in 1985.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UWO1989"&gt;The University of Western Ontario School of Library and Information Science Self-Study Report, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; This change addressed the evolution of library schools across Canada to reflect the expanding impact of computers and technology on the discipline.&lt;ref name="Land2004"&gt;Land, Brian. (2004). History of Education for Library and Information Studies in Canada. [http://www.exlibris.ca/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:newsletters:elan_special_summer_2004.pdf "ELAN: Ex Libris Association Newsletter, Special Issue, Summer 2004"], 1-2. Toronto: Ex Libris Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faculty of Communications and Open Learning (FC&amp;OL) (1996-1997) ===
The Graduate School of Library and Information Science merged with the Graduate School of Journalism to form the Faculty of Communications and Open Learning in 1996.&lt;ref name="GSLIS1997" /&gt;

=== Faculty of Information and Media Studies (FIMS) (1997-Present) ===
The Faculty of Communications and Open Learning was shortly thereafter renamed to the [[Faculty of Information &amp; Media Studies (University of Western Ontario)|Faculty of Information and Media Studies (FIMS)]].&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Curry2000"&gt;Curry, Ann. (2000). [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=4403209&amp;site=ehost-live "Canadian LIS education: Trends and issues"]. ''Education for Information'', 18(4), 325-337.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, there are 34 full-time faculty members in the Faculty of Information &amp; Media Studies.&lt;ref name="Western2016a"&gt;Western University. (2016). [http://www.uwo.ca/about/whoweare/facts.html Facts &amp; Figures 2015-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

=== Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) ===
The University of Western Ontario's Faculty of Information and Media Studies is one of seven faculties in Canada which offers the Masters level graduate study in library and information science.&lt;ref name="Land2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Curry2000" /&gt; The MLIS program is a professional-based Master's program designed to emphasize participation through a seminar style method of education. Tests and exams are not a common method of evaluation in this program, but there is a strong focus on group collaboration, presentation skills, and high quality academic writing. The MLIS program was founded on the belief that there is a common set of principles underlying the practices of all information professions. In order to reflect the values of the research university the program is housed in, there has been a long tradition in this program of developing curriculum that strives for a balance between professional practice and research based theory.&lt;ref name="ALA1976"&gt;Committee on Accreditation, [[American Library Association]]. (1976). ''Report on school of library and information science of University of Western Ontario''. Chicago, IL: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haycock2007"&gt;Haycock, K. (2007), [https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/03074800710722162 Education for library and information studies in Canada: a cross-cultural comparison], ''New Library World'', 108 1/2, pp. 32-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Western Ontario offers the only MLIS degree in Canada which can be completed in 12 months.&lt;ref name="Curry2000" /&gt; Students are required to complete a total of 15 courses, which can be completed in one academic year (3 terms, 12 months) if students take the full course load of five courses per term and do not participate in the co-op program.&lt;ref name="Western2016b"&gt;Western University. (2016). [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/structure.html Program Structure].&lt;/ref&gt; Students may also choose to take a reduced course load or complete the program on a part-time basis.&lt;ref name="Western2016b" /&gt;

There are five required courses which all MLIS students are required to take: 
* LIS 9001 (Perspectives on Library and Information Science)
* LIS 9002 (Information Organization, curation and Access)
* LIS 9003 (Information Sources and Services)
* LIS 9004 (Research Method and Statistics)
* LIS 9005 (Managing and Working in Information Organizations).&lt;ref name="Western2016b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Western2016c"&gt;Western University. (2016). [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/courses.html Courses].&lt;/ref&gt;

Students must also complete a total of 10 elective courses, choosing these electives from at least four out of the five [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/content_areas.html program content areas]:
* Information Organization, Curation, and Access
* Information Policy
* Connecting People with Information
* Information and Communication Technology
* Managing and Working in Information Institutions&lt;ref name="Western2016b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Western2016d"&gt;Western University. (2016). [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/content_areas.html Program Content Areas].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Co-op Program ====
The LIS [[Cooperative education|co-op]] program at the University of Western Ontario started in 1979, making it the first LIS co-op program in Canada.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Curry2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MLIS Graduate Student Handbook Winter 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It allows students to engage in one or two paid work terms at a library or information-related position.&lt;ref name="Western2016e"&gt;Western University. (2016). [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/ Master of Library &amp; Information Science (MLIS)].&lt;/ref&gt; However, co-op is not a requirement of the program and students do not gain credits towards their degree by completing co-op work terms.&lt;ref name="Western2016coop"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/coop.html |title=MLIS Co-op |publisher=Western University |date=2016| access-date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berg2009"&gt;Berg, S.

''The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 35''(6), 591-598. doi:10.1016/j.acalib.2009.08.007&lt;/ref&gt; The placements are facilitated by the co-op office and arranged between the employers and students.&lt;ref name="OLAnd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessola.org/web/OLA/Membership/Students_and_Recent_Graduates/Host_a_student/OLA/Careers/Library_School_Programs.aspx?hkey=320f62ff-de9c-4cd1-aac8-0bfebbc7529d|title=Employer Opportunities to Engage Library School Students|publisher=Ontario Library Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number and locations of placements vary each term.&lt;ref name="Western2016coop" /&gt;

=== Library and Information Science PhD ===
The Ontario Council of Graduate Studies approved the University of Western Ontario's LIS PhD program in 1973, and the first graduate of the program was awarded a PhD in Library and Information Sciences in 1978.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt; The initial focus of the doctoral program was on bibliographical control, but the program has since shifted over the decades to cover two broad [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/phd_library_information_science/specialization.html fields of specialization] which represent the areas of research and teaching in the LIS PhD program: "Information &amp; Society" and "Information Organization &amp; Technologies".&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Western2016PhDSpec"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/phd_library_information_science/specialization.html |title=Fields of Specialization |publisher=Western University |date=2016 |access-date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research clusters within the faculty and doctoral program include:
* Information and Communication Technologies
* Health Information and Policy
* Marxist Political Economy of Information
* Social Relations of Information Practices, Reading and Libraries
* Theoretical Problems in Information Studies: Philosophy, Ethics, Epistemology
* Webometrics and Infometrics
&lt;ref name="Western2016PhDSpec" /&gt;

In addition to completing six courses (two required, four elective), doctoral candidates are required to complete a research proposal, thesis (including public presentation of thesis topic), comprehensive and oral exams, and they are also required to attend all LIS research colloquia.&lt;ref name="Western2016PhDProg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/phd_library_information_science/progression.html |title=Progression and Milestones |publisher=Western University|date=2016|access-date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of the PhD program depends on each student's own pace and on their decision whether to participate in the [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/phd_library_information_science/coop.html PhD co-op program].&lt;ref name="Western2016PhDcoop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/phd_library_information_science/coop.html|title=The Co-op Program|publisher=Western University|date=2016|access-date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students may also choose to complete the PhD program on a part-time bases.&lt;ref name="Western2016PhDPT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/phd_library_information_science/part_time.html|title=Part-time PhD in the LIS Program|publisher=Western University|date=2016|access-date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== American Library Association (ALA) Accreditation ==
The MLIS program at the University of Western Ontario has continually held its ALA accreditation since 1967/68.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/directory/historicallist|title=Accredited Library and Information Studies Master's Programs from 1925 through Present|first=|last=admin|date=20 July 2006|publisher=[[American Library Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==
The Library and Information Science programs are currently housed in the FIMS and Nursing Building (FNB) at the University of Western Ontario's main campus, after moving in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.westerngazette.ca/news/the-insider-look-at-campus-s-latest-building/article_21f3937e-bb1c-11e6-a9f5-abf93a2a7456.html|title=The insider look at campus's latest building|last=Monterroza|first=Moses|work=The Gazette • Western University's Student Newspaper|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library program was previously hosted in the following buildings: a temporary structure near the football stadium (1967-1982), Elborn College (1982-1998), Middlesex College (1998-2004), and North Campus Building (2004-2016).&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;

=== Library ===
A key component of the LIS program at the University of Western Ontario is its faculty-supported library, which was first developed alongside the program's inception in 1966/1967 to support instruction, research, experimentation, and professional development.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorner1990" /&gt; The library first operated entirely outside of the university library system; while still independent of the university system, it now works more closely with it than in its early years.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorner1990" /&gt;

The current version of the program's independent library is called the FIMS Graduate Library, and is located in the FIMS and Nursing Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lib.fims.uwo.ca/about/|title=About – FIMS Graduate Library|website=lib.fims.uwo.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It still primarily serves the LIS program but now also supports the other graduate programs within the Faculty of Media and Information Studies.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GRCAbout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fims-grc.fims.uwo.ca/about-the-grc/|title=About the GRC|access-date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Library Services and Collections ====
The FIMS Graduate Library offers a number of resources to support FIMS graduate students' and faculty's research, instruction, assignment, collaboration, and project needs. The Library houses several bookable meeting spaces complete with presentation tools. The library also contains computer workstations, a maker space, scanners, printers, a reading room, study space, and the FIMS Graduate collection. Although the library collection does not circulate, the contents can be searched for using Western Libraries' Catalogue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lib.fims.uwo.ca/about/|title=About - FIMS Graduate Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library collection at the FIMS Graduate Library is intended to support the learning and research needs of FIMS Graduate students and faculty. The materials generally do not circulate, and can be used in the library space. In addition to the academic print collection, the FIMS Graduate Library provides non-circulating children's books, comics and graphic novels, DVDs, a censored books collection, board games, the [[Peter Desbarats]] journalism collection, and some rare books. The comic books and graphic novels, DVDs, and board games can be borrowed overnight by graduate students or faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lib.fims.uwo.ca/collections/|title=Collections - FIMS Graduate Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the print resources in the library, the FIMS Graduate Library provides graduate students and faculty with access to a number of electronic databases to support research, learning, and professional development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For student and faculty use, experimentation, and programming, the Library contains a makerspace, Bibliotech. Bibliotech contains both high and low-tech maker technology, such as a [[3D printing|3D printer]], a [[Makey Makey|Makeymakey]], and craft supplies. 

As part of the FIMS Graduate Library's involvement in students' professional development and learning, the library offers a series of seminars and workshops. The series, titled "The FIMS Graduate Library Presents...", invites faculty, staff, and guests to share their expertise with students in discussions, lectures, or hands-on workshops. The subject matter for this series ranges from information technology, to career preparedness, to social justice issues in the library and information science discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lib.fims.uwo.ca/events/|title=Events - FIMS Graduate Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reputation ==

Recent LIS research and literature reviews are positive, including reviews by Blaise Cronin and Kara Overfelt. Cronin and Overfelt found that the University of Western Ontario was ranked 2nd regarding average number of peer-reviewed journal articles per faculty member.&lt;ref name="Cronin1996"&gt;Cronin, B., &amp; Overfelt, K. (1996). [http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/00028231/v47i0002/173_popr.xml Brief communication postscript on program rankings]. "Journal of the American Society for Information Science (1986-1998), 47"(2). doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199602)47:2&lt;173::AID-ASI10&gt;3.0.CO;2-6&lt;/ref&gt; William Walters and Esther Isabelle Wilder examined articles published by professionals in the Library and information science discipline and found that the University of Western Ontario had one of the most productive non-iSchool LIS departments.&lt;ref name="Walters2015" /&gt; Western's LIS department was ranked 20th out of 40 in Walters' and Wilder's overall rankings of top departmental contributions to LIS literature, and as the highest Canadian University at 9th out of 55 when only U.S. and Canadian departments were considered.&lt;ref name="Walters2015"&gt;Walters, W. H., &amp; Wilder, E. I. (2015). Disciplinary, national, and departmental contributions to the literature of library and information science, 2007–2012. Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 67(6). doi:10.1002/asi.23448&lt;/ref&gt;

When examining the disciplinary composition of library schools, Irene Lopatovska and Ellie Ransom found that Western's LIS program was among the schools that had the highest percentage of faculty members with training in library professions (42 percent of faculty).&lt;ref name="Lopatovska2016"&gt;Lopatovska, I., &amp; Ransom, E. (2016). The state of L-schools: Intellectual diversity and faculty composition. Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 48(1), 18-35. doi:10.1177/0961000614533718&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers also gave the faculty a high disciplinary rating for having faculty trained across seven different disciplines, including: computing, information, library, social and behavioural sciences, education, humanities, and communication.&lt;ref name="Lopatovska2016" /&gt;

Western's MLIS program reports a good employment placement rate. A 2016 survey by FIMS found that 70% of respondents found employment within or around 6 months after graduation. Out of the 70% that found employment, 95% found employment in the Library and Information Sciences field.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/grads_at_work/placement16.pdf|title=2016 Master of Library and Information Science Placement Survey|last=Faculty of Information and Media Studies at the University of Western Ontario|first=|date=|website=fims.uwo.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey collected responses from 60 out of 114 MLIS students who graduated from Western in 2016. Most graduates found employment at public libraries (42.5% of those employed) or academic libraries (25% of those employed).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 57.5 of those students who found work cited the co-op experience as being most helpful in helping them acquire skills and knowledge to secure employment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Student Groups and Activities ==

There are several [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/student_life/student_clubs/ student groups] that operate within the Library and Information Science program at Western. Some of these groups include MLIS Student Council, [[Librarians Without Borders]], the [[Special Libraries Association]], Student Librarians Association for Children and Youth Services (SLACYS), [[Association of Canadian Archivists]] (ACA) and the [[Art Libraries Society of North America]] (ARLIS/NA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/current/studentgroups.htm|title=FIMS Student Clubs - Faculty of Information &amp; Media Studies - Western University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LIS students and graduates from University of Western Ontario have also been active in their community promoting digital literacy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfpress.com/2015/08/05/maker-bus-loaded-with-technology-visits-festivals-in-detroit-and-toronto|title=Unconventional bus entices techies here|first=|last=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfpress.com/2016/06/07/london-public-librarys-book-a-librarian-program-helps-londoners-get-access-to-deep-databases-could-expand|title=Librarians deliver better results than Google|first=|last=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sharing their love of books.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfpress.com/news/columnists/kate_dubinski/2010/02/22/12990616.html|title=For book lovers, it's paradise found|first=|last=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, faculty members host public interest discussions on relevant events and recent research at their local public libraries to engage with their community.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/about/research/lecture-series/public-interest---fims-talks|title=#PublicInterest Lectures - Faculty of Information &amp; Media Studies - Western University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfpress.com/events/1414679|title="Every single one is my favourite" (Theo, 4 years): Children’s Experiences and Perceptions of E-Book Reading - Events|first=|last=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2622">The '''Library of Latin Texts''' (LLT) is a subscription-based database of Latin texts, from Antiquity up to the present day. First started in 1991 as the ''Cetedoc Library of Christian Latin Texts'' (CLCLT), it continues to be developed by the ''Centre ‘Traditio Litterarum Occidentalium’'' and is hosted by [[Brepols Publishers]].

== History ==
In 1991, development of the ''Cetedoc Library of Christian Latin Texts'' (CLCLT) started, with the aim of encompassing the entirety of Christian Latin literature. This digital database, initially released as a [[CD-ROM]], was produced by the Cetedoc, led by prof. [[Paul Tombeur]] at the [[Université catholique de Louvain]]. Since 2001, the activities of Cetedoc have been continued in Turnhout by the ''Centre ‘Traditio Litterarum Occidentalium’'' (CTLO), still led by Paul Tombeur.

When in 2002, the decision was made to expand the database's chronological scope beyond Medieval and Patristic times, its name was changed to ''Library of Latin Texts''. A further development followed in 2009. Then, a B series (LLT-B) was added to the original LLT (hence known as LLT-A). The LLT-B's scope was to accelerate the growth of the database by directly adopting the text of existing editions, without the intensive research work that is applied to the texts of the LLT-A. This work includes verifying facts related to the text and correcting errors in the printed edition.&lt;ref name="Brepolis"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brepolis.net/pdf/Brepolis_LLT_EN.pdf|title=Library of Latin Texts|publisher=BREPOL&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;S|accessdate=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference between the LLT and similar databases ==
Unlike similar initiatives, like [[Corpus Corporum]] or [[The Latin Library]], the LLT is not an open-access database. This allows for the adoption of copyrighted editions. In fact, while open-access initiatives have to rely on out-of-copyright, possibly outdated editions, the LLT's policy is to select texts that have "been edited according to best contemporary scholarly practice".&lt;ref name="Brepolis" /&gt;

'''Lichen morphology''' includes [[lichen growth forms]] used to group lichens by "vegetative" [[thallus]] types, and forms of "non-vegetative" reproductive parts. Some lichen thalli have the aspect of leaves (foliose lichens); others cover the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] like a crust (crustose lichens) (''illustration, right''), others such as the genus ''[[Ramalina]]'' adopt shrubby forms (fruticose lichens), and there are gelatinous lichens such as the genus ''[[Collema]]''.&lt;ref name=Smith1929&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, A.L. |year=1929 |title=Lichens |publisher=Cambridge University Press |series=Cambridge Botanical Handbooks |isbn=0-916422-33-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the form of a lichen is determined by the [[DNA|genetic material]] of the fungal partner, association with a photobiont is required for the development of that form.  When grown in the laboratory in the absence of its photobiont, a lichen fungus develops as an undifferentiated mass of [[hypha]]e. If combined with its photobiont under appropriate conditions, its characteristic form emerges, in the process called [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Brodo, Sharnoff &amp; Sharnoff, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In a few remarkable cases, a single lichen fungus can develop into two very different lichen forms when associating with either a green algal or a cyanobacterial symbiont. Quite naturally, these alternative forms were at first considered to be different species, until they were found growing in a conjoined manner.

There is evidence to suggest that the lichen symbiosis is [[parasitism|parasitic]] or [[commensalism|commensalistic]], rather than [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]].&lt;ref name=Ahmadjian&gt;Ahmadjian 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The photosynthetic partner can exist in nature independently of the fungal partner, but not vice versa. Furthermore, photobiont cells are routinely destroyed in the course of [[nutrient]] exchange. The association is able to continue because reproduction of the photobiont cells matches the rate at which they are destroyed.&lt;ref name=Ahmadjian/&gt;

Under magnification, a section through a typical foliose lichen [[Thallus (tissue)|thallus]] reveals four layers of interlaced fungal filaments. The uppermost layer is formed by densely agglutinated fungal hyphae building a protective outer layer called the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]], which can reach several hundred μm in thickness.&lt;ref name=Budel1996&gt;{{cite journal| author = Büdel, B.|author2=Scheidegger, C. | year = 1996| title = Thallus morphology and anatomy| journal = Lichen Biology| pages = 37–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cortex may be further topped by an epicortex 0.6-1μm thick in some Parmeliaceae, which may be with or without pores, and is secreted by cells—it is not itself cellular.&lt;ref name=Budel1996/&gt; In lichens that include both green algal and cyanobacterial symbionts, the cyanobacteria may be held on the upper or lower surface in small pustules called [[cephalodium|cephalodia]]. Beneath the upper cortex is an algal layer composed of algal cells embedded in rather densely interwoven fungal hyphae. Each cell or group of cells of the photobiont is usually individually wrapped by hyphae, and in some cases penetrated by an [[haustorium]]. Beneath this algal layer is a third layer of loosely interwoven fungal hyphae without algal cells. This layer is called the [[wikt:medulla|medulla]]. Beneath the medulla, the bottom surface resembles the upper surface and is called the [[lower cortex]], again consisting of densely packed fungal hyphae. The lower cortex of [[foliose]] lichens often bears rootlike fungal structures known as [[rhizines]], which serve to attach the thallus to the substrate on which it grows. Lichens also sometimes contain structures made from fungal [[metabolite]]s, for example crustose lichens sometimes have a [[polysaccharide]] layer in the cortex. Although each lichen thallus generally appears homogeneous, some evidence seems to suggest that the fungal component may consist of more than one genetic individual of that species. This seems to also be true of the photobiont species involved.

A [[podetium]] (plural [[podetia]]) is a lichenized stem-like structure of an [[apothecium]] rising from the primary body of the thallus.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ&gt;[http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary3.html Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (p-z), Alan Silverside]&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is part of the reproductive tissue, it is not considered part of the thallus.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; The podetium may be branched, and sometimes cup-like. It usually bears the [[pycnidia]] or [[apothecia]] or both.

In [[astronomy]], a '''light curve''' is a graph of light intensity of a [[celestial object]] or region, as a function of time. The light is usually in a particular frequency interval or [[Frequency band|band]]. Light curves can be periodic, as in the case of [[eclipsing binary|eclipsing binaries]], [[Cepheid variable]]s, other periodic variables, and [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Transit photometry|transiting]] [[extrasolar planets]], or [[aperiodic]], like the light curve of a [[nova]], a [[cataclysmic variable star]], a [[supernova]] or a [[Gravitational microlensing|microlensing event]] or binary as observed during [[occultation]] events. The study of the light curve, together with other observations, can yield considerable information about the physical process that produces it or constrain the physical theories about it.

== Variable stars ==
{{main|Variable star}}
[[File:Delta Cephei lightcurve.jpg|thumb|left|Light curve of [[δ Cephei]] showing [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] versus pulsation [[phase (waves)|phase]]]]

Graphs of the [[apparent magnitude]] of a variable star over time are commonly used to visualise and analyse their behaviour. Although the categorisation of variable star types is increasingly done from their spectral properties, the amplitudes, periods, and regularity of their brightness changes are still important factors. Some types such as [[Cepheid variable|Cepheids]] have extremely regular light curves with exactly the same period, amplitude, and shape in each cycle. Others such as [[Mira variable]]s have somewhat less regular light curves with large amplitudes of several magnitudes, while the [[semiregular variable]]s are less regular still and have smaller amplitudes.&lt;ref name=gcvs/&gt;

The shapes of variable star light curves give valuable information about the underlying physical processes producing the brightness changes. For eclipsing variables, the shape of the light curve indicates the degree of totality, the relative sizes of the stars, and their relative surface brightnesses.&lt;ref name=russell/&gt; It may also show the [[Eccentricity (astronomy)|eccentricity]] of the orbit and [[Ellipsoidal variable|distortions in the shape]] of the two stars.&lt;ref name=kron/&gt;  For pulsating stars, the amplitude or period of the pulsations can be related to the luminosity of the star, and the light curve shape can be an indicator of the pulsation mode.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt;

=== Supernovae ===
{{main|Supernova}}
[[File:Comparative supernova type light curves.png|thumb|left|Comparative [[supernova]] type light curves]]

Light curves from [[supernova]]e can be indicative of the type of supernova. Although supernova types are defined on the basis of their spectra, each has typical light curve shapes. [[Type I supernova]]e have light curves with a sharp [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] and gradually decline, while [[Type II supernova]]e have less sharp maxima. Light curves are helpful for classification of faint supernovae and for the determination of sub-types. For example, the type II-P (for plateau) have similar spectra to the type II-L (linear) but are distinguished by a light curve where the decline flattens out for several weeks or months before resuming its fade.&lt;ref name=hyperphysics/&gt;
{{clear|left}}

== {{anchor|Planetology}} Planetary astronomy ==
{{main|Planetary science}}

In [[planetary science]], a light curve can be used to derive the [[rotation period]] of a [[minor planet]], [[natural satellite|moon]], or [[comet]] nucleus. From the [[Earth]] there is often no way to resolve a small object in the [[Solar System]], even in the most powerful of [[telescope]]s, since the apparent angular size of the object is smaller than one pixel in the detector. Thus, astronomers measure the amount of light produced by an object as a function of time (the light curve). The time separation of peaks in the light curve gives an estimate of the rotational period of the object. The difference between the maximum and minimum brightnesses (the [[amplitude]] of the light curve) can be due to the shape of the object, or to bright and dark areas on its surface. For example, an asymmetrical asteroid's light curve generally has more pronounced peaks, while a more spherical object's light curve will be flatter.&lt;ref name="lc"/&gt; This allows astronomers to infer information about the shape and spin (but not size) of asteroids.

=== Asteroid lightcurve database ===

==== {{anchor|LCDB quality code}} Light curve quality code ====

The ''Asteroid Lightcurve Database'' (LCDB) of the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) uses a numeric code to assess the quality of a period solution for minor planet light curves (it does not necessarily assess the actual underlying data). Its quality code parameter "U" ranges from 0 (incorrect) to 3 (well-defined):&lt;ref name="LCDB"/&gt;
* ''U = 0'' → Result later proven incorrect
* ''U = 1'' → Result based on fragmentary light curve(s), may be completely wrong.
* ''U = 2'' → Result based on less than full coverage. Period may be wrong by 30 percent or ambiguous. 
* ''U = 3'' → Secure result within the precision given. No ambiguity.
* ''U = n.a.'' → Not available. Incomplete or inconclusive result.

A trailing plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) is also used to indicate a slightly better or worse quality than the unsigned value.&lt;ref name="LCDB" /&gt;

=== Occultation light curves ===

[[File:LightCurve AsteroidOccultation.png|thumb|Light Curve of the asteroid 1247 Dysona occulting 4UCAC 174-171272, showing instantaneous disappearance and reappearance. Duration is 6.48 seconds.]]

The [[Asteroid occultation|occultation]] light curve is often characterised as binary, where the light from the star is terminated instantaneously, remains constant for the duration, and is reinstated instantaneously. The duration is equivalent to the length of a [[Chord (astronomy)|chord]] across the occulting body.

Circumstances where the transitions are not instantaneous are;
* when either the occulting or occulted body are double , e.g. a [[double star]] or [[Binary asteroid|double asteroid]], then a step light curve is observed.
* when the occulted body is large, e.g. a star like Antares, then the transitions are gradual.
* when the occulting body has an atmosphere, e.g. the moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sicardy|first=B.|last2=Brahic|first2=A.|last3=Ferrari|first3=C.|last4=Gautiert|first4=D.|last5=Lecacheux|first5=J.|last6=Lellouch|first6=E.|last7=Reques|first7=F.|last8=Arlot|first8=J.

The observations are typically recorded using [[video]] equipment and the disappearance and reappearance timed using a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] disciplined Video Time Inserter (VTI).

Occultation light curves are archived at the [[VizieR]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dave|first=Herald,|last2=Derek|first2=Breit,|last3=David|first3=Dunham,|last4=Eric|first4=Frappa,|last5=Dave|first5=Gault,|last6=Tony|first6=George,|last7=Tsutomu|first7=Hayamizu,|last8=Brian|first8=Loader,|last9=Jan|first9=Manek,|date=2016|title=VizieR Online Data Catalog: Occultation lights curves (Herald+ 2016)|bibcode=2016yCat....102033H|journal=VizieR On-line Data Catalog|language=en|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Light curve inversion ==
Light curve inversion is a mathematical technique used to model the surfaces of rotating objects from their brightness variations. This can be used to effectively image [[starspot]]s or asteroid surface [[albedo]]s.&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt;&lt;ref name=roettenbacher/&gt;

== Microlensing ==
{{main|Gravitational microlensing}}

Microlensing is a process where relatively small and low-mass astronomical objects cause a brief small increase in the brightness of a more distant object. This is caused by the small [[general relativity|relativistic effect]] as larger [[gravitational lens]]es, but allows the detection and analysis of otherwise-invisible stellar and planetary mass objects. The properties of these objects can be inferred from the shape of the lensing light curve. For example, [[PA-99-N2]] is a microlensing event that may have been due to a star in the [[Andromeda galaxy]] that has an [[exoplanet]].&lt;ref name=haugan/&gt;

== Introduction ==
All plants and animals, from [[protist|simple life forms]] to humans, live in close association with microbial organisms.&lt;ref name="Mendes2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Mendes | first1=R. | last2=Raaijmakers | first2=J.M. | doi=10.1038/ismej.2015.7 | title=Cross-kingdom similarities in microbiome functions | journal=The ISME Journal | volume=9 | issue=9 | pages=1905–1907 | year=2015 | pmid= 25647346| pmc=4542044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several advances have driven the perception of microbiomes,  including:

* the ability to perform genomic and gene expression analyses of single cells and of entire microbial communities in the disciplines of [[metagenomics]] and [[metatranscriptomics]]&lt;ref name="BoMc2011"/&gt;
* databases accessible to researchers across multiple disciplines&lt;ref name="BoMc2011"/&gt;
* methods of mathematical analysis suitable for complex data sets&lt;ref name="BoMc2011"/&gt;

Biologists have come to appreciate that microbes make up an important part of an organism's [[phenotype]], far beyond the occasional symbiotic case study.&lt;ref name="BoMc2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Bosch | first1=T. C. G. | last2=McFall-Ngai | first2=M. J. | doi=10.1016/j.zool.2011.04.001 | title=Metaorganisms as the new frontier | journal=Zoology | volume=114 | issue=4 | pages=185–190 | year=2011 | pmid= 21737250| pmc=3992624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of host relationships===
[[Commensalism]], a concept developed by [[Pierre-Joseph van Beneden]] (1809-1894), a Belgian professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Louvain]] during the nineteenth century &lt;ref&gt;Poreau B., ''[http://www.theses.fr/2014LYO10114   Biologie et complexité : histoire et modèles du commensalisme]''. PhD Dissertation, University of Lyon, France, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; is central to the microbiome, where microbiota colonize a host in a non-harmful coexistence. The relationship with their host is called [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] when organisms perform tasks that are known to be useful for the host,&lt;ref name="Prescotts"/&gt;{{rp|700}}&lt;ref name=Quigley2013rev&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Quigley | first1=E. M. | date=Sep 2013 | title=Gut bacteria in health and disease | journal=Gastroenterol Hepatol (N Y) | volume=9 | issue=9| pages=560–9 | pmid=24729765 | pmc=3983973}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[parasitism|parasitic]], when disadvantageous to the host. Other authors define a situation as mutualistic where both benefit, and commensal, where the unaffected host benefits the symbiont.&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt; A nutrient exchange may be bidirectional or unidirectional, may be context dependent and may occur in diverse ways.&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt; Microbiota that are expected to be present, and that under normal circumstances do not cause disease, are deemed ''normal flora'' or ''normal microbiota''.&lt;ref name="Prescotts"/&gt;

===Acquisition and change===
The [[initial acquisition of microbiota]] in animals from mammalians to marine [[sponge]]s is at birth, and may even occur through the germ cell line. In plants, the colonizing process can be initiated below ground in the [[Rhizosphere|root zone]], around the germinating seed, the [[spermosphere]], or originate from the above ground parts, the [[phyllosphere]] and the [[flower]] zone or anthosphere.&lt;ref name= pgpg/&gt; The stability of the rhizosphere microbiota over generations depends upon the plant type but even more on the soil composition, i.e. living and non living environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Tkacz | first1=Andrzej | last2=Cheema | first2=Jitender | last3=Chandra | first3=Govind | last4=Grant | first4=Alastair | last5=Poole | first5=Philip S. | date=Nov 2015 | title=Stability and succession of the rhizosphere microbiota depends upon plant type and soil composition | journal=ISME J. | volume=9 | issue=11 | pages=2349–2359 | doi=10.1038/ismej.2015.41 | pmc=4611498 | pmid=25909975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microbiota by host ==

Consensus exists among evolutionary biologists that one should not separate an organism's genes from the context of its resident microbes.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The human microbiota includes [[Bacterium|bacteria]], [[Fungus|fungi]], [[archaea]] and viruses. [[Micro-animal]]s which live on the human body are excluded.

The [[Human Microbiome Project]] sequenced the genome of the human microbiota, focusing particularly on the microbiota that normally inhabit the skin, mouth, nose, digestive tract, and vagina.&lt;ref name="Prescotts"/&gt; It reached a milestone in 2012 when it published initial results.&lt;ref name=hmpdata&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jun2012/nhgri-13.htm |title=NIH Human Microbiome Project defines normal bacterial makeup of the body |publisher=NIH News |date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In mammals, herbivores such as cattle depend on their [[rumen]] microbiome to convert cellulose into proteins, short chain fatty acids, and gases.

* [[Mice]] have become the most studied mammalian regarding their microbiomes. The gut microbiota have been studied in relation to allergic airway disease, obesity, gastrointestinal diseases and diabetes. Perinatal shifting of microbiota through low dose antibiotics can have long-lasting effects on future susceptibility to allergic airway disease. The frequency of certain subsets of microbes has been linked to disease severity. The presence of specific microbes early in postnatal life, instruct future immune responses.&lt;ref name=" pmid = 22422004 "&gt;{{cite journal | author = Russell SL, Gold MJ| title = Early life antibiotic-driven changes in microbiota enhance susceptibility to allergic asthma | journal = EMBO Rep. | volume = 13 | issue = 5 |date=May 2012 | pmid = 22422004 | pmc = 3343350 | url = http://embor.embopress.org/content/13/5/440.long | pages = 440–7 | doi=10.1038/embor.2012.32|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" pmid = 25145536 "&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Russell SL, Gold MJ, etal | title = Perinatal antibiotic-induced shifts in gut microbiota have differential effects on inflammatory lung diseases | journal = J Allergy Clin Immunol |date=Aug 2014 | pmid = 25145536 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674914008938 | doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2014.06.027 | volume=135 | issue = 1 | pages=100–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In gnotobiotic mice certain gut bacteria were found to transmit a particular phenotype to recipient germ-free mice, that promoted accumulation of colonic regulatory T cells, and strains that modulated mouse adiposity and cecal metabolite concentrations.&lt;ref name=" pmid = 17183312 "/&gt; This combinatorial approach enables a systems-level understanding of microbial contributions to human biology.&lt;ref name=" pmid = 24452263 "&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Faith JJ, Ahern PP, Ridaura VK, etal | title = Identifying gut microbe-host phenotype relationships using combinatorial communities in gnotobiotic mice. | journal = Sci.

* Insects have their own microbiomes. For example, [[leaf-cutter ants]] form huge underground colonies harvesting hundreds of kilograms of leaves each year and are unable to digest the cellulose in the leaves directly. They maintain fungus gardens as the colony's primary food source. While the fungus itself does not digest cellulose, a microbial community containing a diversity of bacteria is doing so. Analysis of the microbial population's genome revealed many genes with a role in cellulose digestion. This microbiome's predicted carbohydrate-degrading enzyme profile is similar to that of the bovine rumen, but the species composition is almost entirely different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Suen |author2=Scott JJ |author3=Aylward FO |display-authors=et al |title=An Insect Herbivore Microbiome with High Plant Biomass-Degrading Capacity |journal=PLoS Genet|year=2010|volume=6|issue=9|pages=e1001129 |url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1001129 |editor1-last=Sonnenburg |editor1-first=Justin |pmid=20885794|pmc=2944797|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gut microbiota of the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] can affect the way its gut looks, by impacting epithelial renewal rate, cellular spacing, and the composition of different cell types in the epithelium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Broderick | first1 = Nichole A. | last2 = Buchon | first2 = Nicolas | last3 = Lemaitre | first3 = Bruno | year = 2014 | title = Microbiota-Induced Changes in Drosophila melanogaster Host Gene Expression and Gut Morphology | journal = mBio. | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = e01117–14 | pmc=4045073 | pmid=24865556 | doi=10.1128/mBio.01117-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the moth [[Spodoptera exigua]] is infected with [[baculovirus]] immune-related genes are downregulated and the amount of its gut microbiota increases.&lt;ref name=baculo&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jakubowska | first1 = Agata K. | last2 = Vogel | first2 = Heiko | last3 = Herrero | first3 = Salvador | date = May 2013 | title = Increase in Gut Microbiota after Immune Suppression in Baculovirus-infected Larvae | url = | journal = PLoS Pathog | volume = 9 | issue = 5| page = e1003379 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003379 | PMC=3662647 | pmid=23717206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Co-evolution of microbiota ==
{{Main|Hologenome theory of evolution}}
[[File:Keppelbleaching.jpg|thumb|200px|Bleached branching coral (foreground) and normal branching coral (background). Keppel Islands, [[Great Barrier Reef]]]]
Organisms evolve within eco-systems so that the change of one organism affects the change of others. [[Coevolution|Co-evolution]] (also called "hologenome theory") proposes that an object of natural selection is not the individual organism, but the organism together with its associated organisms, including its microbial communities.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

'''Coral reefs'''. The hologenome theory originated in studies on coral reefs. Coral reefs are the largest structures created by living organisms, and contain abundant and highly complex microbial communities. Over the past several decades, major declines in coral populations have occurred. [[Climate change]], water pollution and over-fishing are three stress factors that have been described as leading to disease susceptibility. Over twenty different coral diseases have been described, but of these, only a handful have had their causative agents isolated and characterized. [[Coral bleaching]] is the most serious of these diseases. In the Mediterranean Sea, the bleaching of ''[[Oculina]] patagonica'' was first described in 1994 and shortly determined to be due to infection by [[Vibrio shiloi]]. From 1994 to 2002, bacterial bleaching of ''O. patagonica'' occurred every summer in the eastern Mediterranean. Surprisingly, however, after 2003, ''O. patagonica'' in the eastern Mediterranean has been resistant to ''V. shiloi'' infection, although other diseases still cause bleaching. The surprise stems from the knowledge that corals are long lived, with lifespans on the order of decades,&lt;ref name="BBRT2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baird AH, Bhagooli R, Ralph PJ, Takahashi S |title=Coral bleaching: the role of the host |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|year=2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=16–20 |url=http://www.reefresilience.org/pdf/Baird_etal_2009.pdf |pmid=19022522|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not have [[adaptive immune system]]s.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}} Their [[innate immune system]]s do not produce antibodies, and they should seemingly not be able to respond to new challenges except over evolutionary time scales.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

The puzzle of how corals managed to acquire resistance to a specific pathogen led to a 2007 proposal, that a dynamic relationship exists between corals and their symbiotic microbial communities. It is thought that by altering its composition, the [[holobiont]] can adapt to changing environmental conditions far more rapidly than by genetic mutation and selection alone. Extrapolating this hypothesis to other organisms, including higher plants and animals, led to the proposal of the "hologenome theory of evolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rosenberg E, Koren O, Reshef L, Efrony R, Zilber-Rosenberg I|title=The role of microorganisms in coral health, disease and evolution|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|year=2007|volume=5|issue=5|pages=355–362|pmid=17384666|doi=10.1038/nrmicro1635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of |2007}} the hologenome theory was still being debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|vauthors=Leggat W, Ainsworth T, Bythell J, Dove S, Gates R, Hoegh-Guldberg O, Iglesias-Prieto R, Yellowlees D | title=The hologenome theory disregards the coral holobiont

| doi=10.1038/nrmicro1635-c1
| issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A major criticism has been the claim that ''V. shiloi'' was misidentified as the causative agent of coral bleaching, and that its presence in bleached ''O. patagonica'' was simply that of opportunistic colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|vauthors=Ainsworth TD, Fine M, Roff G, Hoegh-Guldberg O | title=Bacteria are not the primary cause of bleaching in the Mediterranean coral ''Oculina patagonica''

| issue=1
}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is true, the basic observation leading to the theory would be invalid. The theory has gained significant popularity as a way of explaining rapid changes in adaptation that cannot otherwise be explained by traditional mechanisms of natural selection. Within the hologenome theory, the holobiont has not only become the principal unit of natural selection but also the result of other step of integration that it is also observed at the cell ([[symbiogenesis]], [[endosymbiosis]]) and genomic levels.&lt;ref name="Salvucci2014"/&gt;

=== Targeted amplicon sequencing ===

Targeted [[amplicon]] sequencing relies on having some expectations about the composition of the community that is being studied. In target amplicon sequencing a phylogenetically informative marker is targeted for sequencing. Such a marker should be present in ideally all the expected organisms. It should also evolve in such a way that it is conserved enough that primers can target genes from a wide range of organisms while evolving quickly enough to allow for finer resolution at the taxonomic level. A common marker for human microbiome studies is the gene for bacterial [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] (''i.e.'' "16S rDNA", the sequence of DNA which encodes the ribosomal RNA molecule).&lt;ref name="Kucz2012"&gt;{{Cite journal

The 16S rDNA gene contains both slowly evolving regions and fast evolving regions; the former can be used to design broad primers while the latter allow for finer taxonomic distinction. However, species-level resolution is not typically possible using the 16S rDNA. Primer selection is an important step, as anything that cannot be targeted by the primer will not be amplified and thus will not be detected. Different sets of primers have been shown to amplify different taxonomic groups due to sequence variation.

After the amplicons are sequenced, [[molecular phylogenetic]] methods are used to infer the composition of the microbial community. This is done by clustering the amplicons into [[operational taxonomic unit]]s (OTUs) and inferring phylogenetic relationships between the sequences. Due to the complexity of the data, distance measures such as [[UniFrac]] distances are usually defined between microbiome samples, and downstream multivariate methods are carried out on the distance matrices. An important point is that the scale of data is extensive, and further approaches must be taken to identify patterns from the available information. Tools used to analyze the data include VAMPS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VAMPS: The Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures|url=http://vamps.mbl.edu/|publisher=Bay Paul Center, MBL, Woods Hole|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[QIIME]]&lt;ref name="CapoKucz2010"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Projects ==

The [[Human Microbiome Project]] launched in 2008 was a United States [[National Institutes of Health]] initiative to identify and characterize microorganisms found in both healthy and diseased humans.&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hmpdacc.org/overview/about.php | title=NIH Human Microbiome Project | publisher=US National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, US Government | date=2016 | accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five-year project, best characterized as a feasibility study with a budget of $115 million tested how changes in the human microbiome are associated with human health or disease.&lt;ref name=nih/&gt;

The [[Earth Microbiome Project]] (EMP) is an initiative to collect natural samples and analyze the microbial community around the globe. Microbes are highly abundant, diverse and have an important role in the ecological system. Yet {{As of|2010|lc=on}}, it was estimated that the total global environmental DNA sequencing effort had produced less than 1 percent of the total DNA found in a liter of seawater or a gram of soil,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = J.

The EMP aims to process as many as 200,000 samples in different biomes, generating a complete database of microbes on earth to characterize environments and ecosystems by microbial composition and interaction. Using these data, new ecological and evolutionary theories can be proposed and tested.&lt;ref name=GilbertDor2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = J.

The Brazilian Microbiome Project aims to assemble a Brazilian Microbiome Consortium/Database. This is the first attempt to collect and collate information about Brazilian microbial genetic and functional diversity in a systematic and holistic manner. New sequence data have been generated from samples collected in all Brazilian regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brmicrobiome.org Brazilian Microbiome Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

E., Lewis, A. J., Tomberlin, J. K., &amp; Pechal, J. L. (2013). Seasonal necrophagous insect community assembly during vertebrate carrion decomposition.

The process of decomposition is complex, and aside from microorganisms such as [[bacteria]], other organisms help to decompose the cadaver including [[fungi]], [[nematode]]s, and [[insect]]s&lt;ref name=atl15&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/12/meet-the-necrobiome-the-predictable-microbes-that-will-eat-your-dying-corpse/419676/ | author=Ed Young |title= Meet the Necrobiome: The Waves of Microbes That Will Eat Your Corpse |publisher=[[The Atlantic]]| date=December 10, 2015| accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as larger [[scavenger]] animals. The process of [[decomposition]] is fundamental to the cycle of life.&lt;ref name=costandi&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2015/may/05/life-after-death |author=Mo Costandi |title=Life after death: the science of human decomposition  |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=May 5, 2015 |accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As death ensues, the microbial ecosystem that lived off the living organism collapses and, nourished by the decomposition, a new and changing microbial ecosystem establishes itself. It has been noted that there is first a shift from [[Aerobic bacteria|aerobic]] to [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacteria leading to [[putrefaction]] and [[bloating]].&lt;ref name=costandi/&gt; A shift back to aerobic bacteria occurs in the abdominal cavity when it gets opened.&lt;ref name=metcalf/&gt; Bacteria come from the body as well as the environment.&lt;ref name=sf08&gt;{{cite url |url=https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/your-necrobiome-lives-on-after-you-die/| author=[[Ira Flatow]] with Jessica Metcalf and Jennifer Pechal |title=After You Die, Your “Necrobiome” Lives On |publisher=[[Science Friday]]| date=March 23, 2018| accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been difficult to study the necrobiome as the vast majority of its bacteria do not grow well in the laboratory environment.&lt;ref name=sc14&gt;{{cite news ||url=https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/38946/title/The-Necrobiome/| author=Chris Palmer |title=The Necrobiome  |publisher=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]] |date=February 1, 2014| accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our understanding of naturally occurring necrobiomes is further complicated by the fact that different portions of a corpse may be in different stages of decomposition.&lt;ref name=sc14/&gt; However, the ability to apply [[DNA sequencing|advanced sequencing]] has helped researchers to investigate and monitor the necrobiome.&lt;ref name=metcalf/&gt;

The composition of the necrobiome appears to change in a predictable way representing “a microbial clock” &lt;ref name=metcalf&gt;{{cite journal| author= Metcalf JL, Wegener Parfrey L, Gonzalez A, Lauber CL, Knights D, Ackermann G, Humphrey GC, Gebert MJ, Van Treuren W, Berg-Lyons D, Keepers K, Guo Y, Bullard J, Fierer N, Carter DO, Knight R| title=A microbial clock provides an accurate estimate of the postmortem interval in a mouse model system| journal= eLife |date= October 15, 2013| doi=10.7554/eLife.01104 |pmid=24137541}}&lt;/ref&gt;—apparently regardless of season, species, or soil type.&lt;ref name=atl15/&gt; The speed of the decomposition is, however, temperature dependent.&lt;ref name=costandi/&gt;

It has been suggested that the predictability of the sequence of changes of the necrobiome may be useful in [[forensics]] to help determine the time of death.&lt;ref name=sa16/&gt;&lt;ref name=metcalf/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="985">A '''noise print''' is part of a technique used in [[noise reduction]]. A noise print is commonly used in [[audio mastering]] to reduce the effects of unwanted noise from a piece of audio. In this case, the noise print would be a recording of the ambient noise in the room, which is then used to set multiple expanders, effectively 'gating out' those frequencies whilst the signal level in that band is lower than that in the noise print. Many plugins for Studio software can be used to apply noise reduction in this way.

Noise reduction usually results in unwanted [[Compression artifact|artifacts]], sometimes referred to as "twittering" or "birdies". Different algorithms for noise reduction control these artifacts with varying levels of success.

== History ==
Northeast Maritime Institute was founded in 1981 as the Tidewater School of Navigation, Inc. in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]], Massachusetts.  The school originally provided only continuing education courses and programs approved by the [[United States Coast Guard]] prior to becoming a college.  In 1997 the school was renamed Northeast Maritime Institute and later moved its location to Fairhaven, Massachusetts where its main campus building is located today.  Since its relocation the school has grown to four campus buildings all within walking distance and located within the center of Fairhaven.

In 2008, the Institute launched The Fairhaven Project through a public-private partnership with the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] to advance the cause of peace between Israel and Palestine.  The program brought groups of Israeli and Palestinian students to Fairhaven where they would work together onboard the brigantine tall ship m/s Fritha.  A 30-minute documentary of the 2008 program was created and utilized by U.S. Embassies and Consulates in the Middle East and other regions of conflict to stimulate student discussions and extend a message of equality and understanding to a larger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/e/oes/rls/fs/2009/119487.htm|title=The Fairhaven Project: Israeli &amp; Palestinian Youths Sail Tall Ship for Peace|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Northeast Maritime Institute delivers a range of on-line maritime education and training programs through its Learning Management System “NEMO°” (also called Northeast Maritime Online).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://northeastmaritimeonline.com|title=Northeast Maritime Online (NEMO) Education and Examination System|website=northeastmaritimeonline.com|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The online education and training system was designed so that seafarers could complete training at sea rather than during their shore leave.

In 2018, Northeast Maritime Institute entered into a partnership program with the University of Virgin Islands for development of a degree program in maritime management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stthomassource.com/content/2018/06/03/uvi-board-oks-new-maritime-degree/|title=UVI Board OKs New Maritime Degree|last=staff|first=Source|date=2018-06-04|website=St. Thomas Source|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic programs ==

=== Nautical science ===
The Institute’s College of Nautical Science is a [[Merchant navy|merchant marine]] college intended to prepare students to work onboard ships as [[Deck department|deck officers]] and [[Sea captain|captains]] upon graduation.  In addition to completing all shore-side college classes, students are required to complete two “Semesters at Sea” whereby they work onboard U.S. flagged commercial vessels.  Students may elect to complete their Semesters at Sea onboard any vessel that meets program requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northeastmaritime.com/collegeofmaritimescience/|title=Maritime College  {{!}}  Northeast Maritime Institute|website=www.northeastmaritime.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One OPC specification from the [[OPC Foundation]] is '''OPC Xi (OPC Express Interface)'''. OPC Xi defines a .NET interface with the combined functionality of OPC DA, HDA, AE and a rather simple data model. [[OPC Unified Architecture]] in comparison allows the same functionality, including a .NET interface and a similar data model to OPC DA, HDA, and AE, but also supports platform independence and optionally complex information modeling capabilities.

==What is OPC Xi?==
OPC Xi can securely transport data among automation applications on separate computers. It can only run in .NET environments and thus not in all plant network environments.  To transport data, Classic OPC relies on [[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]], however OPC Xi works with [[Windows Communication Foundation]].  This means that [[Managed code]] applications don’t need a .NET wrapper for DCOM interoperation, but a wrapper from COM to .NET on the server, adding complexity to the server environment.

==OPC Xi and Networks==
The use of WCF allows OPC Xi to be functional with small and large networks.  OPC Xi can be configured for communication across firewalls and [[Network Address Translation|Network Address Translation (NAT)]].

==Security and OPC Xi==
In addition to the security implied in WCF (authentication, authorization and encryption), OPC Xi has additional security measures that restrict write, read, and subscribe access to servers.  This is done based on authentication and protocol of the client application that is attempting to access the server using [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|http]] or [[Transmission Control Protocol|tcp]].

==OPC Xi Specification==
The OPC Xi specification is defined in a Windows Helpfile. Different versions of this file without obvious version information are available from [http://opcfoundation.org/ OPC Foundation official website.]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4681">An '''oral law''' is a [[code of conduct]] in use in a given [[culture]], [[religion]] or community application, by which a body of rules of human behaviour is transmitted by [[oral tradition]] and effectively respected, or the single rule that is orally transmitted.

Many cultures have an oral law, while most contemporary legal systems have a formal written organisation. The oral tradition (from the [[Latin]] ''tradere'' = to transmit) is the typical instrument of transmission of the oral codes or, in a more general sense, is the complex of what a culture transmits of itself among the generations, "from father to son". This kind of transmission can be due to lack of other means, such as in illiterate or criminal societies, or can be expressly required by the same law.

There has been a continuous debate over oral versus written transmission, with the focus on the perceived higher reliability of written evidence,&lt;ref&gt;Finnegan, 195-201&lt;/ref&gt; primarily based on the "linear world of academia" where only written down records are accepted. However, "standard" theories of orality and literacy have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Goody, pp.27-68&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oral law in jurisprudence ==
From a legal point of view, an oral law can be:
*a [[Habituation|habit]], or [[convention (norm)|custom]] with legal relevance or when the formal law expressly refers to it (but in this latter case, it is properly an indirect source of legal [[rights]] and [[Law of obligations|obligation]]s);
*a spoken command  or order that has to be respected as a [[law]] (in most modern western legal systems, some dispositions can be issued by word in given cases of emergency).
An oral law, intended as a body of rules, can be admitted in [[jurisprudence]] as long as it shows some efficacy, therefore it needs that the law is public, the human action is evaluated by a [[judge]] (ordinarily producing a [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] according to the general interpretation of the law) and then a [[punishment]] has eventually to be put into effect. Some oral laws provide all these elements (for instance, some codes of conduct in use among criminal associations like [[the Mafia]] do have a well known law, a judge, a condemnation), while others usually miss some of them.

== Oral law in Judaism ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Halakha]] --&gt;
{{main|Oral Torah}}

Although the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term "[[Torah]]" is often translated as "Law", it can just as accurately be translated as "Instruction" or "teaching".  [[Rabbinic Judaism]] maintains that the books of the [[Tanakh]] were transmitted in parallel with an oral tradition, as relayed by God to Moses and from him handed on to the scholarly and other religious leaders of each generation.  Thus, in Judaism, the "Written Instruction" (''Torah she-bi-khtav'' תורה שבכתב) comprises the Torah and the rest of the [[Tanakh]]; the "Oral Instruction" (''Torah she-be'al peh'' תורה שבעל פה) was ultimately recorded in the [[Talmud]] (lit. "Learning") and [[Midrash]]im (lit. "Interpretations").  The interpretation of the [[Oral Torah]] is thus considered as the authoritative reading of the [[Tanakh|Written Torah]]. Further, [[Halakha]] (lit. "The Path", frequently translated as "Jewish Law") is based on a "Written Instruction" together with an "Oral Instruction". Jewish law and tradition is thus not based on a literal reading of the Tanakh, but on the combined oral and written tradition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4102">The '''overall nutritional quality index''' is a [[Nutritional rating systems|nutritional rating system]] developed at the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center. It assigns foods a score between 1 and 100 to reflect the overall [[nutrition]] provided relative to the calories consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/22/foodanddrink-healthandwellbeing|title=Think you know what's good for you to eat? asks Emine Saner|first=Emine|last=Saner|date=21 October 2008|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system has been marketed commercially as NuVal, and some consumer foods in the [[United States]] are marked with ONQI values as "NuVal".

==Description==
The ONQI for a food is the ratio of a "numerator" value representing beneficial nutrients such as [[iron]], [[dietary fibre]] and [[vitamins]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuval.com/Science#Numerator_Nutrients ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "denominator" value representing detrimental nutrients such as [[cholesterol]] and [[saturated fat]].

The following foods have the maximum ONQI of 100:&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/3241667/Health-food-Yale-Universitys-Overall-Nutritional-Quality-Index.html ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; broccoli, blueberries, [[okra]], oranges and green beans. Some of the lowest ONQIs are for white bread (9), hot dog (5), apple pie (2) and [[Ice pop]] (1).

Panspermia hypotheses propose (for example) that [[microscopic life|microscopic life-forms]] that can survive the effects of space (such as [[extremophile]]s) can become trapped in debris ejected into space after collisions between planets and [[small Solar System bodies]] that harbor life. Some [[organism]]s may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with [[protoplanetary disk]]s. Under certain ideal impact circumstances (into a body of water, for example), and ideal conditions on a new planet's surfaces, it is possible that the surviving organisms could become active and begin to colonize their new environment. Panspermia studies concentrate not on  [[abiogenesis|how life began]], but on the methods that may cause its distribution in the Universe.&lt;ref name="Wesson"&gt;A variation of the panspermia hypothesis is '''necropanspermia''' which astronomer Paul Wesson describes as follows: "The vast majority of organisms reach a new home in the Milky Way in a technically dead state … Resurrection may, however, be possible." {{cite news|last= Grossman |first= Lisa |title = All Life on Earth Could Have Come From Alien Zombies |publisher= ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' |date= 2010-11-10 |url= https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/11/necropanspermia/|accessdate= 10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoyle, F 1981. pp35-49"&gt;Hoyle, F. and Wickramasinghe, N.C.

Pseudo-panspermia (sometimes called ''"soft panspermia"'' or ''"molecular panspermia"'') argues that the pre-biotic organic building-blocks of life originated in space, became incorporated in the solar nebula from which planets condensed, and were further—and continuously—distributed to planetary surfaces where life then emerged ([[abiogenesis]]).&lt;ref name="Klyce 2001"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.panspermia.org/oseti.htm | title = Panspermia Asks New Questions | accessdate= 25 July 2013 | last = Klyce | first = Brig | date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |doi= 10.1117/12.435366 |chapter= Panspermia asks new questions |title= The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) in the Optical Spectrum III |journal= Proc.

The chemistry leading to [[life]] may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the Universe was only 10 to 17 million years old. Though the presence of life is confirmed only on the Earth, some scientists think that extraterrestrial life is not only plausible, but probable or inevitable. Probes and instruments have started examining other planets and moons in the Solar System and in other planetary systems for evidence of having once supported simple life, and projects such as [[SETI]] attempt to detect [[radio transmission]]s from possible extraterrestrial civilizations.

The first known mention of the term was in the writings of the 5th-century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Anaxagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Leary |first=Margater |year=2008 |title=Anaxagoras and the Origin of Panspermia Theory |publisher=iUniverse Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-595-49596-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panspermia began to assume a more scientific form through the proposals of [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] (1834),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Berzelius| first =J.

=== Radiopanspermia ===
In 1903, [[Svante Arrhenius]] published in his article ''The Distribution of Life in Space'',&lt;ref&gt;"Die Verbreitung des Lebens im Weltenraum" (the "Distribution of Life in Space"). Published in ''Die Umschau''. 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; the hypothesis now called radiopanspermia, that microscopic forms of life can be propagated in space, driven by the [[radiation pressure]] from stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholson | first1 = Wayne L. | year = 2009 | title = Ancient micronauts: interplanetary transport of microbes by cosmic impacts | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 17 | issue = 6| pages = 243–250 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2009.03.004 | pmid = 19464895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrhenius argued that particles at a critical size below 1.5 μm would be propagated at high speed by radiation pressure of the Sun. However, because its effectiveness decreases with increasing size of the particle, this mechanism holds for very tiny particles only, such as single bacterial spores.&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck' /&gt; The main criticism of radiopanspermia hypothesis came from [[Iosif Shklovsky]] and [[Carl Sagan]], who pointed out the proofs of the lethal action of space radiations ([[UV]] and [[X-ray]]s) in the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shklovskii, I. S.  |author2=Sagan, Carl | title = Intelligent Life in the Universe | publisher = Emerson-Adams Press, Incorporated | date = 1966 |isbn=978-1-892803-02-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the evidence, Wallis and Wickramasinghe argued in 2004 that the transport of individual bacteria or clumps of bacteria, is overwhelmingly more important than lithopanspermia in terms of numbers of microbes transferred, even accounting for the death rate of unprotected bacteria in transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wickramasinghe |first1=M.K. |author2=Wickramasinghe, C.|title=Interstellar transfer of planetary microbiota |journal=Mon.

Then, data gathered by the orbital experiments [[Exobiology Radiation Assembly|ERA]], [[BIOPAN]], [[EXOSTACK]] and [[EXPOSE]], determined that isolated spores, including those of ''[[B. subtilis]]'', were killed by several orders of magnitude if exposed to the full space environment for a mere few seconds, but if shielded against solar [[UV]], the spores were capable of surviving in space for up to six years while embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites).&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck' /&gt;&lt;ref name=Protection&gt;{{cite journal|title=Protection of Bacterial Spores in Space, a Contribution to the Discussion on Panspermia|journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere : The Journal of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life|volume=31|issue=6|pages=527–47|bibcode=2002ESASP.518..105R|pmid=11770260|year=2001|author1=Horneck|first1=G|last2=Rettberg|first2=P|last3=Reitz|first3=G|last4=Wehner|first4=J|last5=Eschweiler|first5=U|last6=Strauch|first6=K|last7=Panitz|first7=C|last8=Starke|first8=V|last9=Baumstark-Khan|first9=C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though minimal protection is required to shelter a spore against UV radiation, exposure to solar UV and cosmic ionizing radiation of unprotected DNA, break it up into its bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rahn | first1 = R.O. | last2 = Hosszu | first2 = J.L. | year = 1969 | title = Influence of relative humidity on the photochemistry of DNA films | journal = Biochim.

=== Lithopanspermia ===

Lithopanspermia, the transfer of organisms in rocks from one planet to another either through interplanetary or interstellar space, remains speculative.

* '''Planetary ejection''' — For lithopanspermia to occur, researchers have suggested that microorganisms must survive ejection from a planetary surface which involves extreme forces of acceleration and shock with associated temperature excursions. Hypothetical values of shock pressures experienced by ejected rocks are obtained with Martian meteorites, which suggest the shock pressures of approximately 5 to 55&amp;nbsp;GPa, acceleration of 3&amp;nbsp;Mm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]] of 6&amp;nbsp;Gm/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and post-shock temperature increases of about 1 K to 1000 K.&lt;ref name='Cockell 2008'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11084-007-9112-3 |pmid=17906941 |title=The Interplanetary Exchange of Photosynthesis |date=2007 |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles S. |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=87–104|bibcode=2008OLEB...38...87C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/ast.2007.0134 |title=Microbial Rock Inhabitants Survive Hypervelocity Impacts on Mars-Like Host Planets: First Phase of Lithopanspermia Experimentally Tested |date=2008 |last1=Horneck |first1=Gerda |display-authors=4 |last2=Stöffler |first2=Dieter |last3=Ott |first3=Sieglinde |last4=Hornemann |first4=Ulrich |last5=Cockell |first5=Charles S. |last6=Moeller |first6=Ralf |last7=Meyer |first7=Cornelia |last8=De Vera |first8=Jean-Pierre |last9=Fritz |first9=Jörg |last10=Schade |first10=Sara |last11=Artemieva |first11=Natalia A. |journal=Astrobiology |volume=8 |pages=17–44 |pmid=18237257 |issue=1|bibcode=2008AsBio...8...17H }}&lt;/ref&gt; To determine the effect of acceleration during ejection on microorganisms, rifle and ultracentrifuge methods were successfully used under simulated outer space conditions.&lt;ref name="Experimental methods" /&gt;
* '''Survival in transit''' — The survival of microorganisms has been studied extensively using both simulated facilities and in low Earth orbit. A large number of microorganisms have been selected for exposure experiments. It is possible to separate these microorganisms into two groups, the human-borne, and the [[extremophiles]]. Studying the human-borne microorganisms is significant for human welfare and future manned missions; whilst the extremophiles are vital for studying the physiological requirements of survival in space.&lt;ref name="Experimental methods" /&gt;
* '''Atmospheric entry''' — An important aspect of the lithopanspermia hypothesis to test is that microbes situated on or within rocks could survive hypervelocity entry from space through Earth's atmosphere (Cockell, 2008). As with planetary ejection, this is experimentally tractable, with sounding rockets and orbital vehicles being used for microbiological experiments.&lt;ref name="Experimental methods" /&gt;&lt;ref name='Cockell 2008' /&gt; ''[[B. subtilis]]'' spores inoculated onto [[granite]] domes were subjected to hypervelocity atmospheric transit (twice) by launch to a ∼120&amp;nbsp;km altitude on an Orion two-stage rocket.

As photosynthetic organisms must be close to the surface of a rock to obtain sufficient light energy, atmospheric transit might act as a filter against them by ablating the surface layers of the rock. Although [[cyanobacteria]] have been shown to survive the desiccating, freezing conditions of space in orbital experiments, this would be of no benefit as the STONE experiment showed that they cannot survive atmospheric entry.&lt;ref name='filter'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/ast.2006.0038 |title=Interplanetary Transfer of Photosynthesis: An Experimental Demonstration of a Selective Dispersal Filter in Planetary Island Biogeography |date=2007 |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles S. |display-authors=4 |last2=Brack |first2=André |last3=Wynn-Williams |first3=David D. |last4=Baglioni |first4=Pietro |last5=Brandstätter |first5=Franz |last6=Demets |first6=René |last7=Edwards |first7=Howell G.M. |last8=Gronstal |first8=Aaron L. |last9=Kurat |first9=Gero |last10=Lee |first10=Pascal |last11=Osinski |first11=Gordon R. |last12=Pearce |first12=David A. |last13=Pillinger |first13=Judith M. |last14=Roten |first14=Claude-Alain |last15=Sancisi-Frey |first15=Suzy |journal=Astrobiology |volume=7 |pages=1–9 |pmid=17407400 |issue=1|bibcode=2007AsBio...7....1C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, non-photosynthetic organisms deep within rocks have a chance to survive the exit and entry process. (See also: [[Impact survival]].)  Research presented at the European Planetary Science Congress in 2015 suggests that ejection, entry and impact is survivable for some simple organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://astrobiology.com/2013/09/could-life-have-survived-a-fall-to-earth.html |title= Could Life Have Survived a Fall to Earth? |work=EPSC |date=12 September 2013 |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accidental panspermia ===
[[Thomas Gold]], a professor of [[astronomy]], suggested in 1960 the hypothesis of "Cosmic Garbage", that life on Earth might have originated accidentally from a pile of [[waste]] products dumped on Earth long ago by extraterrestrial beings.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, T. "Cosmic Garbage", Air Force and Space Digest, 65 (May 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Directed panspermia ===
{{Main|Directed panspermia}}
Directed panspermia concerns the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space, sent to Earth to start life here, or sent from Earth to seed new planetary systems with life by [[introduced species]] of microorganisms on lifeless planets. The Nobel prize winner [[Francis Crick]], along with [[Leslie Orgel]] proposed that life may have been purposely spread by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization,&lt;ref name="Crick_Orgel" /&gt; but considering an early "[[RNA world]]" Crick noted later that life may have originated on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/7/1/238.pdf Anticipating an RNA world. Some past speculations on the origin of life: where are they today?]" by L. E. Orgel and F. H. C. Crick in ''FASEB J.'' (1993) Volume 7 pages 238–239.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that 'directed' panspermia was proposed in order to counteract various objections, including the argument that microbes would be inactivated by the space environment and [[cosmic radiation]] before they could make a chance encounter with Earth.&lt;ref name='C. Clark'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Planetary Interchange of Bioactive Material: Probability Factors and Implications | journal = Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere | date = February 2001 | first = Benton C.

Conversely, active directed panspermia has been proposed to secure and expand life in space.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; This may be motivated by biotic ethics that values, and seeks to propagate, the basic patterns of our organic gene/protein life-form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title =Life-centered ethics, and the human future in space | journal = Bioethics | volume = 23 | pages = 433–440 | date = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00688.x | pmid=19077128 | url = http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf |issue =8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panbiotic program would seed new planetary systems nearby, and clusters of new stars in interstellar clouds. These young targets, where local life would not have formed yet, avoid any interference with local life.

For example, microbial payloads launched by solar sails at speeds up to 0.0001 ''c'' (30,000&amp;nbsp;m/s) would reach targets at 10 to 100 light-years in 0.1 million to 1 million years. Fleets of microbial capsules can be aimed at clusters of new stars in star-forming clouds, where they may land on planets or be captured by asteroids and comets and later delivered to planets. Payloads may contain [[extremophile]]s for diverse environments and [[cyanobacteria]] similar to early microorganisms. Hardy multicellular organisms (rotifer cysts) may be included to induce higher evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Mautner | first = Michael Noah Ph.D.| author-link =Michael Noah Mautner | title =Seeding the Universe with Life: Securing our Cosmological Future | publisher=Legacy Books (www.amazon.com) | date = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-476-00330-9 | url = http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFSeedingtheUniverse2005Book.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The probability of hitting the target zone can be calculated from &lt;math&gt;P(\text{target}) = \frac{A(\text{target})}{\pi (dy)^2} = \frac{a r(\text{target})^2 v^2}{(tp)^2 d^4}&lt;/math&gt; where ''A''(target) is the cross-section of the target area, ''dy'' is the positional uncertainty at arrival; ''a'' – constant (depending on units), ''r''(target) is the radius of the target area; ''v'' the velocity of the probe; (tp) the targeting precision (arcsec/yr); and ''d'' the distance to the target, guided by high-resolution astrometry of 1×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; arcsec/yr (all units in SIU). These calculations show that relatively near target stars(Alpha PsA, Beta Pictoris) can be seeded by milligrams of launched microbes; while seeding the Rho Ophiochus star-forming cloud requires hundreds of kilograms of dispersed capsules.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Directed panspermia to secure and expand life in space is becoming possible because of developments in [[solar sails]], precise [[astrometry]], [[extrasolar planets]], [[extremophiles]] and microbial [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gros|first=Claudius|date=2016-09-05|title=Developing ecospheres on transiently habitable planets: the genesis project|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10509-016-2911-0|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|language=en|volume=361|issue=10|doi=10.1007/s10509-016-2911-0|issn=0004-640X}}&lt;/ref&gt; After determining the composition of chosen meteorites, [[Astroecology|astroecologists]] performed laboratory experiments that suggest that many colonizing microorganisms and some plants could obtain many of their chemical nutrients from asteroid and cometary materials.&lt;ref name=bioresources&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Planetary bioresources and astroecology. 1.

A number of publications since 1979 have proposed the idea that directed panspermia could be demonstrated to be the origin of all life on Earth if a distinctive 'signature' message were found, deliberately implanted into either the [[genome]] or the [[genetic code]] of the first microorganisms by our hypothetical progenitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Message through time | author = Marx, G.  | journal =Acta Astronautica | date = 1979| volume = 6| issue = 1–2 | pages = 221–225 | doi =10.1016/0094-5765(79)90158-9| bibcode = 1979AcAau...6..221M  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Is bacteriophage φX174 DNA a message from an extraterrestrial intelligence? | author = Yokoo, H. | author2 = Oshima, T.  | journal =Icarus | date = 1979| volume = 38| issue = 1 | pages = 148–153 | doi =10.1016/0019-1035(79)90094-0 | bibcode=1979Icar...38..148Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/science/26DNA.html |title=Human DNA, the Ultimate Spot for Secret Messages (Are Some There Now?) |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |date=26 June 2007 |accessdate=2014-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Paul C.W. | title = The Eerie Silence: Renewing Our Search for Alien Intelligence | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | location = Boston, Massachusetts | date = 2010 |isbn = 978-0-547-13324-9 | title-link = The Eerie Silence }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pseudo-panspermia ===
{{further| List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules|Abiogenesis#Extraterrestrial organic molecules}}

Pseudo-panspermia (sometimes called soft panspermia, molecular panspermia or quasi-panspermia) proposes that the organic molecules used for life originated in space and were incorporated in the solar nebula, from which the planets condensed and were further —and continuously— distributed to planetary surfaces where life then emerged ([[abiogenesis]]).&lt;ref name="Klyce 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; From the early 1970s it was becoming evident that interstellar dust consisted of a large component of organic molecules. The first suggestion came from [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]], who proposed a polymeric composition based on the molecule [[formaldehyde]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wickramasinghe | first1 = N.C. | year = 1974 | title = Formaldehyde Polymers in Interstellar Space | journal = Nature | volume = 252 | issue = 5483| pages = 462–463 | doi=10.1038/252462a0| bibcode = 1974Natur.252..462W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interstellar molecules are formed by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar clouds of dust and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes [[ion]]ized, often as the result of an interaction with [[cosmic ray]]s. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower.&lt;ref name="pnas103"/&gt; The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.&lt;ref name="brown_pais95"/&gt;

A 2008 analysis of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotopic ratios of organic compounds found in the [[Murchison meteorite]] indicates a non-terrestrial origin for these molecules rather than terrestrial contamination.

The molecule was found around the [[protostar|protostellar]] binary ''IRAS 16293-2422'', which is located 400 light years from Earth.&lt;ref name="NG-20120829"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sugar Found In Space|journal=National Geographic |last=Than |first=Ker |date=August 29, 2012 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/08/120829-sugar-space-planets-science-life/ |accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20120829"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sweet!

In September 2012, [[NASA]] scientists reported that [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), subjected to [[Interstellar medium|interstellar medium (ISM)]] conditions, are transformed, through [[hydrogenation]], [[Oxygenate|oxygenation]] and [[hydroxylation]], to more complex [[Organic compounds|organics]] – "a step along the path toward [[amino acids]] and [[nucleotide]]s, the raw materials of [[protein]]s and [[DNA]], respectively".&lt;ref name="Space-20120920"&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Cooks Up Icy Organics to Mimic Life's Origins|url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html|date=September 20, 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=September 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |title=In-Situ Probing of Radiation-Induced Processing of Organics in Astrophysical Ice Analogs—Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies |date=2012 |last1=Gudipati |first1=Murthy S. |last2=Yang |first2=Rui |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=756 |issue=1 |pages=L24 |bibcode=2012ApJ...756L..24G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic signature]] which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in [[interstellar ice]] [[Cosmic dust#Dust grain formation|grains]], particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of [[protoplanetary disks]]."&lt;ref name="Space-20120920" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901" /&gt;

In 2013, the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA Project) confirmed that researchers have discovered an important pair of prebiotic molecules in the icy particles in [[interstellar space]] (ISM). The chemicals, found in a giant cloud of gas about 25,000 light-years from Earth in ISM, may be a precursor to a key component of DNA and the other may have a role in the formation of an important [[amino acid]]. Researchers found a molecule called cyanomethanimine, which produces [[adenine]], one of the four [[nucleobases]] that form the "rungs" in the ladder-like structure of DNA. The other molecule, called [[ethanamine]], is thought to play a role in forming [[alanine]], one of the twenty amino acids in the genetic code. Previously, scientists thought such processes took place in the very tenuous gas between the stars. The new discoveries, however, suggest that the chemical formation sequences for these molecules occurred not in gas, but on the surfaces of ice grains in interstellar space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/765/1/L9 |title=The Detection of Interstellar Ethanimine (Ch3Chnh) from Observations Taken During the Gbt Primos Survey |date=2013 |last1=Loomis |first1=Ryan A. |display-authors=4 |last2=Zaleski|first2=Daniel P. |last3=Steber |first3=Amanda L. |last4=Neill |first4=Justin L. |last5=Muckle|first5=Matthew T. |last6=Harris |first6=Brent J. |last7=Hollis |first7=Jan M. |last8=Jewell |first8=Philip R.|last9=Lattanzi|first9=Valerio |last10=Lovas |first10=Frank J. |last11=Martinez |first11=Oscar|last12=McCarthy|first12=Michael C. |last13=Remijan |first13=Anthony J. |last14=Pate |first14=Brooks H.|last15=Corby|first15=Joanna F. |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=765 |issue=1 |pages=L9|bibcode=2013ApJ...765L...9L|arxiv=1302.1121}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA ALMA scientist Anthony Remijan stated that finding these molecules in an interstellar gas cloud means that important building blocks for DNA and amino acids can 'seed' newly formed planets with the chemical precursors for life.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, Dave (February 28, 2013) [https://www.nrao.edu/pr/2013/newchem/ Discoveries Suggest Icy Cosmic Start for Amino Acids and DNA Ingredients].

In February 2014, [[NASA]] announced a [http://www.astrochem.org/pahdb/ greatly upgraded database] for tracking [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) in the [[universe]]. According to scientists, more than 20% of the [[carbon]] in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible [[PAH world hypothesis|starting materials]] for the [[Abiogenesis#PAH world hypothesis|formation]] of [[Life#Extraterrestrial life|life]]. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the [[Big Bang]], are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with [[Star formation|new stars]] and [[exoplanets]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140221"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoover |first=Rachel |title=Need to Track Organic Nano-Particles Across the Universe?

In March 2015, NASA scientists reported that, for the first time, complex [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] [[organic compound]]s of [[life]], including [[uracil]], [[cytosine]] and [[thymine]], have been formed in the laboratory under [[outer space]] conditions, using starting chemicals, such as [[pyrimidine]], found in [[meteorite]]s. Pyrimidine, like [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the [[Universe]], may have been formed in [[red giant]]s or in [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] and gas clouds, according to the scientists.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150303"&gt;{{cite web |last=Marlaire |first=Ruth |title=NASA Ames Reproduces the Building Blocks of Life in Laboratory |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory |date=3 March 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypotheses on extraterrestrial sources of illnesses ===
Hoyle and Wickramasinghe have speculated that several outbreaks of illnesses on Earth are of extraterrestrial origins, including the [[1918 flu pandemic]], and certain outbreaks of [[polio]] and [[mad cow disease]].  For the 1918 flu pandemic they hypothesized that [[comet]]ary dust brought the virus to Earth simultaneously at multiple locations—a view almost universally dismissed by experts on this pandemic. Hoyle also speculated that [[HIV]] came from outer space.&lt;ref name="Byrne2008"&gt;{{cite book| first =Joseph Patrick | last = Byrne |title= Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues | type = entry | chapter = Panspermia |url= https://books.google.com/?id=HlTIYgEACAAJ |pages= 454–55| isbn = 9780313341014 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hoyle's death, ''[[The Lancet]]'' published a [[letter to the editor]] from Wickramasinghe and two of his colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wickramasinghe |first1= C| last2=Wainwright | first2 = M| last3=Narlikar | first3 = J |title= SARS—a clue to its origins?|journal=Lancet|date=May 24, 2003 |volume= 361|issue=9371|pages=1832|pmid=12781581|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13440-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they hypothesized that the [[virus]] that causes [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) could be extraterrestrial in origin and not originated from chickens.

=== Case studies ===
* A [[meteorite]] originating from [[Mars]] known as [[ALH84001]] was shown in 1996 to contain [[microscopic]] structures resembling small terrestrial [[nanobacteria]]. When the discovery was announced, many immediately conjectured that these were [[fossil]]s and were the first evidence of [[extraterrestrial life]] — making headlines around the world. Public interest soon started to dwindle as most experts started to agree that these structures were not indicative of life, but could instead be formed abiotically from [[organic molecules]].

=== Hoaxes ===
A separate fragment of the [[Orgueil (meteorite)|Orgueil]] meteorite (kept in a sealed glass jar since its discovery) was found in 1965 to have a seed capsule embedded in it, whilst the original glassy layer on the outside remained undisturbed. Despite great initial excitement, the seed was found to be that of a European [[Juncaceae]] or Rush plant that had been glued into the fragment and camouflaged using [[coal dust]]. The outer "fusion layer" was in fact glue. Whilst the perpetrator of this hoax is unknown, it is thought that they sought to influence the 19th century debate on [[spontaneous generation]] — rather than panspermia — by demonstrating the transformation of inorganic to biological matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contaminated Meteorite|journal=Science|volume=146|issue=3648|pages=1157–61|doi=10.1126/science.146.3648.1157|pmid=17832241|year=1964|last1=Anders|first1=E.|last2=Dufresne|first2=E.

[[File:Blacksmoker in Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hydrothermal vent]]s are able to support [[extremophile]] bacteria on [[Earth]] and may also support life in other parts of the cosmos.]]
Until the 1970s, [[life]] was thought to depend on its access to [[sunlight]]. Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, was believed to obtain its nourishment either from consuming organic detritus rained down from the surface waters or from eating animals that did.&lt;ref name="smoker"&gt;{{cite web |title= Black Smokers and Giant Worms |author=Chamberlin, Sean |date=1999 |work=Fullerton College |url=http://www.courseworld.com/ocean/smokers.html |accessdate=11 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1977, during an exploratory dive to the [[Galapagos Rift]] in the deep-sea exploration submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', scientists discovered colonies of assorted creatures clustered around undersea volcanic features known as [[black smoker]]s.&lt;ref name="smoker" /&gt;  It was soon determined that the basis for this food chain is a form of [[bacterium]] &lt;!--Find name/species.--&gt;that derives its energy from [[Redox|oxidation]] of reactive chemicals, such as [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrogen sulfide]], that bubble up from the Earth's interior. This [[chemosynthesis]] revolutionized the study of biology by revealing that terrestrial life need not be Sun-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist.

=== Research in outer space ===
{{See also|List of microorganisms tested in outer space}}
The question of whether certain [[microorganism]]s can survive in the harsh environment of outer space has intrigued biologists since the beginning of spaceflight, and opportunities were provided to expose samples to space. The first American tests were made in 1966, during the [[Gemini IX]] and [[Gemini XII|XII]] missions, when samples of [[bacteriophage]] T1 and spores of ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]'' were exposed to outer space for 16.8 h and 6.5 h, respectively.&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck' /&gt;&lt;ref name="Experimental methods" /&gt; Other basic life sciences research in [[low Earth orbit]] started in 1966 with the Soviet biosatellite program [[Bion (satellite)|Bion]] and the U.S. [[Biosatellite program]]. Thus, the plausibility of panspermia can be evaluated by examining life forms on Earth for their capacity to survive in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The origin of life, panspermia and a proposal to seed the Universe | journal = Plant Science | date = December 2008 | first = David Tepfer | volume = 175 | issue = 6 | pages = 756–760 | doi = 10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.08.007 | last1 = Tepfer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following experiments carried on [[low Earth orbit]] specifically tested some aspects of panspermia or lithopanspermia:

==== ERA ====
[[File:STS-46 EURECA deployment.jpg|thumb|[[European Retrievable Carrier|EURECA]] facility deployment in 1992]]
The [[Exobiology Radiation Assembly]] (ERA) was a 1992 experiment on board the [[European Retrievable Carrier]] (EURECA) on the biological effects of [[space radiation]]. EURECA was an unmanned 4.5 tonne satellite with a payload of 15 experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1992-049B-03 | title = Exobiology and Radiation Assembly (ERA) |accessdate=22 July 2013 | date = 1992 | work = [[ESA]] | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was an [[astrobiology]] mission developed by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA). [[Spore]]s of different strains of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' and the ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' [[plasmid]] [[pUC19]] were exposed to selected conditions of space (space vacuum and/or defined wavebands and intensities of solar ultraviolet radiation). After the approximately 11-month mission, their responses were studied in terms of survival, [[mutagenesis]] in the ''his'' (''B. subtilis'') or ''[[lac operon|lac]]'' [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] (pUC19), induction of [[DNA]] strand breaks, efficiency of [[DNA repair]] systems, and the role of external protective agents. The data were compared with those of a simultaneously running ground control experiment:&lt;ref name=Dose&gt;{{cite journal | title = ERA-experiment "space biochemistry" | journal = Advances in Space Research | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | date= 1995 |pages = 119–129 |doi = 10.1016/0273-1177(95)00280-R | last1 = Zhang | pmid = 11542696| bibcode = 1995AdSpR..16..119D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Horneck'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biological responses to space: results of the experiment "Exobiological Unit" of ERA on EURECA I | journal = Adv.

* The survival of spores treated with the vacuum of space, however shielded against solar radiation, is substantially increased, if they are exposed in multilayers and/or in the presence of [[glucose]] as protective.
* All spores in "artificial meteorites", i.e. embedded in [[clay]]s or simulated [[Martian soil]], are killed.
* Vacuum treatment leads to an increase of [[mutation frequency]] in spores, but not in [[plasmid]] DNA.
* Extraterrestrial solar [[ultraviolet]] radiation is [[mutagen]]ic, induces strand breaks in the DNA and reduces survival substantially.
* Action [[spectroscopy]] confirms results of previous space experiments of a synergistic action of  [[Vacuum#Outer space|space vacuum]] and [[Ultraviolet|solar UV radiation]] with [[DNA]] being the critical target.
* The decrease in viability of the microorganisms could be correlated with the increase in [[DNA repair#DNA damage|DNA damage]].
* The purple membranes, amino acids and urea were not measurably affected by the dehydrating condition of open space, if sheltered from solar radiation. Plasmid DNA, however, suffered a significant amount of strand breaks under these conditions.&lt;ref name=Dose /&gt;

Experiments developed for BIOPAN are designed to investigate the effect of the space environment on biological material after exposure between 13 and 17 days.&lt;ref name='Kayser'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kayser.it/index.php/life-science/facilities/biopan | title = BIOPAN Pan for exposure to space environment |accessdate=17 July 2013 | date = 2013 | work = Kayser Italia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments in BIOPAN are exposed to [[Insolation|solar]] and [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]], the space vacuum and weightlessness, or a selection thereof. Of the 6 missions flown so far on BIOPAN between 1992 and 2007, dozens of experiments were conducted, and some analyzed the likelihood of panspermia. Some bacteria, [[lichen]]s (''[[Xanthoria elegans]]'', ''[[Rhizocarpon geographicum]]'' and their mycobiont cultures, the black Antarctic microfungi ''Cryomyces minteri'' and ''Cryomyces antarcticus''), spores, and even one animal ([[tardigrades]]) were found to have survived the harsh outer space environment and [[cosmic radiation]].&lt;ref name=Foton&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2008cosp...37..660D |title=Experiment lithopanspermia: Test of interplanetary transfer and re-entry process of epi- and endolithic microbial communities in the FOTON-M3 Mission |author1=De La Torre Noetzel |first1=Rosa |volume=37 |date=2008 |pages=660 |journal=37th COSPAR Scientific Assembly.

==== EXOSTACK ====
[[File:1990 s32 LDEF stow.jpg|thumb|left|EXOSTACK on the [[Long Duration Exposure Facility]] satellite.]]

The German [[EXOSTACK]] experiment was deployed on 7 April 1984 on board the [[Long Duration Exposure Facility]] statellite.  30% of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' [[spores]] survived the nearly 6 years exposure when embedded in salt crystals, whereas 80% survived in the presence of glucose, which stabilize the structure of the cellular macromolecules, especially during vacuum-induced dehydration.&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00016-09 |title=Space Microbiology |date=2010 |last1=Horneck |first1=G. |last2=Klaus |first2=D.

If shielded against solar [[UV]], spores of ''B. subtilis'' were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years, especially if embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites). The data support the likelihood of interplanetary transfer of microorganisms within meteorites, the so-called [[lithopanspermia]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck' /&gt;

==== Tanpopo ====
[[File:Stardust Dust Collector with aerogel.jpg|thumb|Dust collector with [[aerogel]] blocks]]
The [[Tanpopo (mission)|Tanpopo]] mission is an orbital [[astrobiology]] experiment by Japan that is currently investigating the possible interplanetary transfer of life, [[organic compound]]s, and possible terrestrial particles in low Earth orbit. The Tanpopo experiment is taking place at the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of [[Kibo (ISS module)|Kibo module]] of the [[International Space Station]]. The mission will collect [[cosmic dust]]s and other particles for three years by using an ultra-low density silica gel called [[aerogel]]. The purpose is to assess the panspermia hypothesis and the possibility of natural interplanetary transport of life and its precursors.&lt;ref&gt;Yokobori, Shin-ichi et al (2010) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241270775_Microbe_space_exposure_experiment_at_International_Space_Station_(ISS)_proposed_in_Tanpopo_mission Microbe space exposure experiment at International Space Station (ISS) proposed in "Tanpopo" mission].

== Criticism ==
Panspermia is often criticized because it does not answer the question of the [[origin of life]] but merely places it on another celestial body. It was also criticized because it was thought it could not be tested experimentally.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods' /&gt;

Wallis and Wickramasinghe argued in 2004 that the transport of individual bacteria or clumps of bacteria, is overwhelmingly more important than lithopanspermia in terms of numbers of microbes transferred, even accounting for the death rate of unprotected bacteria in transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wickramasinghe |first1=M.K. |author2=Wickramasinghe, C.| title=Interstellar transfer of planetary microbiota |journal=Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.| year=2004| volume=348| pages=52–57| bibcode=2004MNRAS.348...52W| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2004.07355.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then it was found that isolated spores of ''[[B. subtilis]]'' were killed by several orders of magnitude if exposed to the full space environment for a mere few seconds. These results clearly negate the original panspermia hypothesis, which requires single spores as space travelers accelerated by the radiation pressure of the Sun, requiring many years to travel between the planets. However, if shielded against solar [[UV]], spores of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years, especially if embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites). The data support the likelihood of interplanetary transfer of microorganisms within [[meteorite]]s, the so-called '''lithopanspermia''' hypothesis.&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck' /&gt;

The [[population dynamics]] of [[Pest (organism)#Insects|pest insects]] is a subject of interest to farmers, agricultural economists, ecologists, and those concerned with animal welfare.

==Factors affecting populations==

Examples:&lt;ref name=Meyer2009Population&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meyer|first1=John R.|title=Population Dynamics|url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/library/tutorials/ecology/popn_dyn.html|website=General Entomology course at North Carolina State University|accessdate=17 June 2014|date=8 Apr 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** A [[Insect winter ecology|winter freeze]] may kill a constant fraction of [[potato leafhoppers]] in a peanut field regardless of the total number of leafhoppers.
** [[Japanese beetle]] larvae survive well with lots of summer rain.
** Temperature, humidity, fires, storms, dissolved oxygen for aquatic species.
* '''[[Density dependence|Density-dependent]]''': Affect a population more or less as the population is bigger. Examples:&lt;ref name=Meyer2009Population /&gt;
** A bigger population may be more vulnerable to diseases and parasites.
** A bigger population may have more [[intraspecific competition]], while a smaller population may have more [[interspecific competition]].
** Emigration from the population may increase as it becomes more crowded.

==Life tables==

[[File:Helicoverpa zea caterpillar.jpg|thumb|60px|''Helicoverpa zea'' larva feeding on corn]]

A '''[[life table]]''' shows how and how many insects die as they mature from eggs to adults. It helps with pest control by identifying at what life stage pest insects are most vulnerable and how mortality can be increased.&lt;ref name=Meyer2009Life&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meyer|first1=John R.|title=Life Tables|url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/library/tutorials/ecology/lifetables.html|website=General Entomology course at North Carolina State University|accessdate=17 June 2014|date=8 Apr 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''cohort life table''' tracks organisms through the stages of life, while a '''static life table''' shows the distribution of life stages among the population at a single point in time.&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt;

Following is an example of a cohort life table based on field data from Vargas and Nishida (1980).&lt;ref name=VargasNishida1980 /&gt; The overall mortality rate was 94.8%, but this is probably an underestimate because the study collected the pupae in cups, and these may have protected them from birds, mice, harsh weather, and so on.&lt;ref name=VargasNishida1980 /&gt;

===Life expectancy===

From a life table we can calculate '''life expectancy''' as follows. Assume the stages &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are uniformly spaced. The average proportion &lt;math&gt;L_x&lt;/math&gt; of organisms alive at stage &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; between beginning and end is&lt;ref name=Elzinga&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elzinga|first1=Charles|title=Population Biology: Life Tables &amp; Theoretical Populations|url=https://www.msu.edu/course/lbs/158h/manual/populations.pdf|website=Laboratory Manual for Honors Organismal Biology|accessdate=17 June 2014|pages=37–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;L_x = \frac{l_x + l_{x+1}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
The total number &lt;math&gt;T_x&lt;/math&gt; of future stages to be lived by individuals at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and older is&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;T_x = L_x + L_{x+1} + L_{x+2} + ...&lt;/math&gt; .
Then the life expectancy &lt;math&gt;e_x&lt;/math&gt; at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;e_x = \frac{T_x}{l_x}&lt;/math&gt;.
We could have done the same computation with raw numbers of individuals rather than proportions.

===Basic reproductive rate===

If we further know the number &lt;math&gt;F_x&lt;/math&gt; of eggs produced (fecundity) at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, we can calculate the eggs produced per surviving individual &lt;math&gt;m_x&lt;/math&gt; as
: &lt;math&gt;m_x = \frac{F_x}{a_x}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;a_x&lt;/math&gt; is the number of individuals alive at that stage.

The '''basic reproductive rate''' &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt; also known as the '''replacement rate''' of a population, is the ratio of daughters to mothers. If it's greater than 1, the population is increasing. In a stable population the replacement rate should hover close to 1.&lt;ref name=Meyer2009Life /&gt; We can calculate it from life-table data as&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;R_0 = \sum_x l_x m_x&lt;/math&gt;.
This is because each &lt;math&gt;l_x m_x&lt;/math&gt; product computes (first-generation parents at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;)/(first-generation eggs) times (second-generation eggs produced by age-&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; parents)/(first-generation parents at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;).

If &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial population size and &lt;math&gt;N_T&lt;/math&gt; is the population size after a generation, then&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;R_0 = \frac{N_T}{N_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Generation time===
{{Main|Generation time}}
The '''cohort generation time''' &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; is the average duration between when a parent is born and when its child is born. If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is measured in years, then&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;T_c = \frac{\sum_x x l_x m_x}{\sum_x l_x m_x}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Intrinsic rate of increase===

If &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; remains relatively stable over generations, we can use it to approximate the [[Population dynamics#Intrinsic rate of increase|intrinsic rate of increase]] &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; for the population:&lt;ref name=Elzinga /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;r \approx \frac{\ln R_0}{T_c}&lt;/math&gt;.
This is because
: &lt;math&gt;\ln R_0 = \ln \frac{N_T}{N_0} = \ln \frac{N_0 + \Delta N}{N_0} = \ln \left(1 + \frac{\Delta N}{N_0} \right) \approx \frac{\Delta N}{N_0}&lt;/math&gt;,
where the approximation follows from the [[Mercator series]]. &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; is a change in time, &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have
: &lt;math&gt;r \approx \frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} \frac{1}{N_0}&lt;/math&gt;,
which is the discrete definition of the intrinsic rate of increase.

==Growth models==

In general, population growth roughly follows one of these trends:&lt;ref name=Meyer2009Population /&gt;
* [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|Logistic growth]] leveling out at some [[carrying capacity]].

Insect pest growth rates are heavily influenced by temperature and rainfall, among other variables. Sometimes pest populations grow rapidly and become outbreaks.&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;{{cite web|title=Insect pest population dynamics|url=http://weslaco.tamu.edu/research-programs/entomology/subtropical/population/|website=Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research and Extension Center at Weslaco|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degree-day calculations===

Because insects are [[ectothermic]], "temperature is probably the single most important environmental factor influencing insect behavior, distribution, development, survival, and reproduction."&lt;ref name=PetzoldtSeaman2006 /&gt; As a result, [[growing degree-day]]s are commonly used to estimate insect development, often relative to a [[Wiktionary:biofix|biofix]] point,&lt;ref name=PetzoldtSeaman2006&gt;{{cite book|author1=Curtis Petzoldt|author2=Abby Seaman|title=Climate Change and Agriculture: Promoting Practical and Profitable Responses|date=2006|publisher=University of Vermont Extension and New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|url=http://umaine.edu/oxford/files/2012/01/III.2Insects.Pathogens1.pdf|chapter=Climate Change Effects on Insects and Pathogens}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., a biological milestone, such as when the insect comes out of pupation in spring.&lt;ref name=TreeFruitBiofix&gt;{{cite web|title=Tree Fruit Insect Biofix Dates|url=http://utahpests.usu.edu/ipm/htm/fruits/biofix|website=Utah Pests|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degree-days can help with pest control.&lt;ref name=Pruess1983&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pruess|first1=Kenneth P.|title=Day-degree Methods for Pest Management|journal=Environmental Entomology|date=1 Jun 1983|volume=12|issue=3|pages=613–619|doi=10.1093/ee/12.3.613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stenotus.binotatus.jpg|thumb|''[[Stenotus binotatus]]'', a [[plant bug]] in the group [[Heteroptera]]]]

Yamamura and Kiritani approximated the development rate &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; as&lt;ref name=YamamuraKiritani1998&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kohji Yamamura|author2=Keizi Kiritani|title=A simple method to estimate the potential increase in the number of generations under global warming in temperate zones|journal=Applied Entomology and Zoology|date=1998|volume=33|issue=2|pages=289–298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;r = \begin{cases} \frac{T-T_0}{K}, &amp; T \geq T_0 \\ 0, &amp; T &lt; T_0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;,
with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; being the current temperature, &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; being the base temperature for the species, and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; being a thermal constant for the species. A generation is defined as the duration required for the time-integral of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to equal 1. Using linear approximations, the authors estimate that if the temperature increased by &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; (for instance, maybe &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; = 2&amp;nbsp;°C for climate change by 2100 relative to 1990), then the increase in number of generations per year &lt;math&gt;\Delta N&lt;/math&gt; would be&lt;ref name=YamamuraKiritani1998 /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta N \approx \frac{\Delta T}{K} \left(206.7 + 12.46 (m-T_0) \right)&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the current annual mean temperature of a location. In particular, the authors suggest that 2&amp;nbsp;°C warming might lead to, for example, about one extra generation for [[Lepidoptera]], [[Hemiptera]], two extra generations for [[Diptera]], almost three generations for [[Hymenoptera]], and almost five generations for [[Aphidoidea]]. These changes in [[voltinism]] might happen through [[biological dispersal]] and/or [[natural selection]]; the authors point to prior examples of each in Japan.&lt;ref name=YamamuraKiritani1998 /&gt;

===Geometric Brownian motion===

Sunding and Zivin model population growth of insect pests as a [[geometric Brownian motion]] (GBM) process.&lt;ref name=SundingZivin2000&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David Sunding|author2=Joshua Zivin|title=Insect population dynamics, pesticide use, and farmworker health|journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics|date=Aug 2000|volume=82|pages=527–540|doi=10.1111/0002-9092.00044}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is stochastic in order to account for the variability of growth rates as a function of external conditions like weather. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the current insect population, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Population dynamics#Intrinsic rate of increase|intrinsic growth rate]], and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a variance coefficient, the authors assume that
: &lt;math&gt;dX = \alpha X dt + \sigma X dz&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt; is an increment of time, and &lt;math&gt;dz = \xi_t \sqrt{dt}&lt;/math&gt; is an increment of a [[Wiener process]], with &lt;math&gt;\xi_t&lt;/math&gt; being [[Standard normal deviate|standard-normal]] distributed. In this model, short-run population changes are dominated by the stochastic term, &lt;math&gt;\sigma X dz&lt;/math&gt;, but long-run changes are dominated by the trend term, &lt;math&gt;\alpha X dt&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=SundingZivin2000 /&gt;

After solving this equation, we [[Geometric Brownian motion#Properties|find that]] the population at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X_t&lt;/math&gt;, is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normally distributed]]:
: &lt;math&gt;X_t \sim \operatorname{Log-\mathcal{N}}\left(X_0 e^{\alpha t}, X_0^2 e^{2 \alpha t} (e^{\sigma^2 t} - 1)\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial population.&lt;ref name=SundingZivin2000 /&gt;

[[File:Lettuce aphid.jpg|thumb|[[Lettuce aphid]]]]

As a case study, the authors consider [[mevinphos]] application on leaf lettuce in [[Salinas Valley]], California for the purpose of controlling [[aphids]]. Previous research by other authors found that daily percentage growth of the [[green peach aphid]] could be modeled as an increasing linear function of average daily temperature. Combined with the fact that temperature is normally distributed, this agreed with the GBM equations described above, and the authors derived that &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0.1199&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 0.1152&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=SundingZivin2000 /&gt; Since the expected population based on the log-normal distribution grows with &lt;math&gt;e^{\alpha t}&lt;/math&gt;, this implies an aphid doubling time of &lt;math&gt;\ln 2 / 0.1199 = 5.8&lt;/math&gt; days. Note that other literature has found aphid generation times to lie roughly in the range of 4.7 to 5.8 days.&lt;ref name=Li1995&gt;{{cite web|last1=Li|first1=Tang|title=Chapter 6: Shortest Generation Time|url=http://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_06.shtml|website=The University of Florida Book of Insect Records|accessdate=16 June 2014|date=8 May 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repeated outbreak cycles===

A 2013 study analyzed population dynamics of the smaller [[Adoxophyes honmai|tea tortrix]], a moth pest that infests tea plantations, especially in Japan. The data consisted of counts of adult moths captured with [[Insect trap#Light traps|light traps]] every 5–6 days at the Kagoshima tea station in Japan from 1961-2012. Peak populations were 100 to 4000 times higher than at their lowest levels. A [[wavelet]] decomposition showed a clear, relatively stationary annual cycle in the populations, as well as non-stationary punctuations between late April and early October, representing 4-6 outbreaks per year of this [[Voltinism|multivoltine]] species.&lt;ref name=NelsonEtAl2013 /&gt; The cycles result from [[Overshoot (population)|population overshoot]].&lt;ref name=Messer2013 /&gt;

These moths have stage-structured development life cycles, and a traditional hypothesis suggests that these cycles should be most synchronized across the population in the spring due to the preceding effects of cold winter months, and as the summer progresses, the life stages become more randomly assorted.&lt;ref name=NelsonEtAl2013 /&gt; This is often what's observed in North America.&lt;ref name=Messer2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Messer|first1=A'ndrea Elyse|title=Temperature alters population dynamics of common plant pests|url=http://news.psu.edu/story/283282/2013/08/01/research/temperature-alters-population-dynamics-common-plant-pests|accessdate=17 June 2014|agency=Penn State News|date=1 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study observed instead that populations were ''more'' correlated as the season progressed, perhaps because temperature fluctuations enforced synchrony. The authors found that when temperatures first increased above ~15&amp;nbsp;°C in the spring, the population dynamics crossed a [[Hopf bifurcation]] from stability to repeated outbreak cycles, until stabilization again in the fall. Above the Hopf threshold, population-cycle amplitude increased roughly linearly with temperature. This study affirmed the classic concept of temperature as a "pacemaker of all vital rates."&lt;ref name=NelsonEtAl2013&gt;{{cite journal|author1=William A. Nelson|author2=Ottar N. Bjørnstad|author3=Takehiko Yamanaka|title=Recurrent Insect Outbreaks Caused by Temperature-Driven Changes in System Stability|date=16 Aug 2013|volume=341|issue=6147|pages=796–799|doi=10.1126/science.1238477|journal=Science|pmid=23907532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding life-cycle dynamics is relevant for pest control because some insecticides only work at one or two life stages of the insect.&lt;ref name=Messer2013 /&gt;

Chaney, a farm advisor in Monterey County, CA, estimates that mevinphos would kill practically all aphids in a field upon application.&lt;ref name=SundingZivin2000 /&gt; Wyatt, citing data from various ''Arthropod Management Tests'', estimates that the percent of lettuce aphids killed is 76.1% for [[endosulfan]] and 67.0% for [[imidacloprid]].&lt;ref name=Wyatt2002&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wyatt|first1=T.

{{Crossdressing}}
'''Pinaforing''', also called '''petticoating''', is a type of forced [[feminization (activity)|feminization]] that involves dressing a man or boy in girls' clothing.  While the practice has come to be a rare, socially unacceptable form of humiliating punishment, it has risen up as both a subgenre of [[erotic literature]] or other expression of [[sexual fantasy]].

There is some evidence that "petticoat punishment" has occasionally been used as a form of [[child discipline|discipline]], with credible stories of such going back at least to [[Victorian era|Victorian times]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.local6.com/money/2881645/detail.html Report: Boy Forced To Wear Skirt As Punishment], Local6.com, February 24, 2004.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106132449/http://www.local6.com/money/2881645/detail.html |date=November 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Petticoat punishment," as a sexual fetish interest, involves imagining or reenacting this scenario. However, as a fetish interest, these activities are usually heavily exaggerated and sexualized, including elaborate humiliation and public nudity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petticoated.com/history01.htm A Short History of Petticoat Discipline] retrieved 2007-04-30  {{Unreliable source?|certain=y|date=June 2015}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615110949/http://www.petticoated.com/history01.htm |date=June 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They often involve the male being feminized into a [[sissy]] by a powerful female presence (often a mother or aunt) in front of his cousins, sisters, or in some cases, girls of his own age whom he had offended by his boorish behavior.

Petticoating roleplay may include being forced to wear makeup and to carry dolls, purses, and other items associated with girls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petticoated.com/letter2420.htm Letter 20 - A PANTIED MALE HAIRDRESSER - From Lara] retrieved 2007-04-30  {{Unreliable source?|certain=y|date=June 2015}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427175307/http://www.petticoated.com/letter2420.htm |date=April 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, boys were made to perform tasks that they considered to be girls' work and to appear in public in girls' clothing with their mothers, who occasionally dressed in matching outfits. Some people claim that for the mothers, pinaforing sometimes had a sexual context, and many mothers who disciplined their sons in this fashion either had long wanted daughters or found it erotic to feminize their sons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Hall/Adolescence/chap17.htm Classics in the History of Psychology] ADOLESCENCE: ITS PSYCHOLOGY AND ITS RELATIONS TO PHYSIOLOGY, ANTHROPOLOGY, SOCIOLOGY, SEX, CRIME, RELIGION AND EDUCATION Volume 2 G. Stanley Hall (1904): [p. 561] CHAPTER XVII ADOLESCENT GIRLS AND THEIR EDUCATION, retrieved 2007-04-30 {{Failed verification|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2015}} In addition, according to the folklore of people who later develop [[transvestic fetishism]], this type of [[castigation]] was found in their early development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderpsychology.org/transsexual/dsm_iiiR.html Classics in the History of Psychology] retrieved 2007-04-30 {{Unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petticoat discipline also occurs in the context of some marital relationships, as a means by which a wife may exert control over her husband. This may involve various items of feminine clothing or underwear in a variety of contexts, ranging from the husband having to wear a feminine apron around the house whilst performing household chores, to the wife insisting that the husband wear a [[brassiere]] and/or panties on a full-time basis&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brassiered.com brassiered: a complete guide to brassiere discipline] {{Unreliable source?|certain=y|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; under ordinary male clothing. In all such circumstances, there is a strong reliance on the element of humiliation, whether actual or potential, should the husband's secret be discovered.

== Techniques ==

This fantasy revolves around being forced to, under threat of [[corporal punishment]], [[public humiliation]] or another [[erotic humiliation]] activity. Afterwards, the victim sometimes finds out that they actually enjoy said punishment, and becomes more "feminine," polite and controllable. He is then often forced to wear an article of girl's clothing permanently until a certain age, or until a role-play scenario is finished.&lt;ref name="petpunessay"&gt;[http://www.petticoated.com/petpunessay.htm Petticoat Punishment in Erotic Literature Part One: Before 'Gynecocracy'] Peter Farrer, retrieved 2007-04-30 {{Unreliable source?|certain=y|date=June 2015}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060612013107/http://www.petticoated.com/petpunessay.htm |date=June 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat related to [[Clothed female, naked male|CFNM]]. Such activities on a child is considered extremely questionable, and mentally dangerous.

Often, there are specific themes for said petticoating. Often, petticoating revolves around the "little girl" aspect in which the submissive/child is forced to act like a little girl. Other scenarios include [[Paraphilic infantilism|infantilism]] and [[Uniform fetishism#French maid uniform|sissy maid]].

Clothing often incorporated include:
*[[Brassiere|Bra]]
*[[Panties]]
*[[Tights]]
*[[Corset]]
*[[Nail polish]]
*[[Petticoat]]
*[[Pinafore]] (often in the style of a [[French Maid]])
*[[Dress]] (often extremely short or revealing, often with lock)
*[[Skirt]] (often a mini/micro skirt)
*[[Shoes]] (often [[Mary Jane (shoe)|Mary Janes]] or [[heel (shoe)|heels]])
*[[Choker]] (close fitting necklace)
*[[Mittens]] (no fingers)

== Political incorrectness ==

Stella Gonzalez-Arnal of the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Hull]] sees pinaforing as a "politically incorrect form of sexuality" in which "women's clothing and women's traditional occupations" are regarded "as inferior and humiliating; reinforcing undesirable stereotypes by characterising females as submissive, passive, helpless and subservient." She adds "I will argue that petticoating is a politically ambiguous form of sexuality which can have positive readings. I claim that it can be educational and therapeutical and that it can subvert our notions of masculinity and femininity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfc.org.uk/node/179 The ambiguous politics of petticoating] Stella Gonzalez-Arnal, Dept of Philosophy, University of Hull, retrieved 2007-04-30  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116230836/http://www.pfc.org.uk/node/179 |date=January 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
{{unreferencedsection|date=October 2018}}
Petticoating a child is illegal in many Islamic states.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} It is considered highly immoral to punish a child in this fashion, but still exists in many of the [[Commonwealth]] states in a small extent as a legal practice as long as the child is not being sexually abused.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} The thin line between petticoating and [[child sexual abuse]] has been a serious factor in petticoating, and has at least one occasion, led to a child sexual abuse charge.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Petticoating as a sexual role-play activity is generally considered legal, with the exception of going into public in an obscene fashion, causing public disturbances or indecent exposure.

== Literary accounts ==

A number of erotic novels of the Victorian period contain accounts of pinaforing.

In ''[[Gynecocracy (novel)|Gynecocracy]]:  A Narrative of the Adventures and Psychological Experiences of Julian Robinson'', by "Viscount Ladywood" (1893),&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Bullough, "Cross dressing, sex, and gender", University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8122-1431-5}}, page 211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ekins, "Blending genders: social aspects of cross-dressing and sex-changing", Routledge, 1996, {{ISBN|0-415-11551-5}}, appendix 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jahsonic.com/Gynecocracy.html Gynecocracy] retrieved 2007-04-30&lt;/ref&gt; the author recounts his punishment as a boy at the hands of the governmess to whom he is sent, along with three female cousins, after taking indecent liberties with a household maid. Forced to wear girls' clothing as his ordinary attire, Julian, as Julia, is subjected to frequent [[flagellation]]s, as are his cousins, one of whom he later marries, submitting to her dominance through continued forced feminization and crossdressing.

The Victorian classic, ''[[My Secret Life (erotica)|My Secret Life]]'' by "Walter" (1888),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.my-secret-life.com/ |title=My Secret Life by Walter |access-date=2008-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514130901/http://www.my-secret-life.com/ |archive-date=2008-05-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; contains an account of pinaforing in which the main character, Walter, witnesses the [[birching]] of a wealthy middle-aged man by a prostitute while the man wears feminine attire.

''[[The Pearl (magazine)|The Pearl]],  A Journal of Facetiae and Voluptuous Reading'' (1879–1880), a Victorian [[pornographic magazine]], also contains an account of the flagellation of a victim dressed as a woman, although, in the strict sense, this account does not represent pinaforing per se because the man, Frank, is not petticoated as part of his punishment but has, rather, dressed in ladies' garments to disguise himself as a woman: to avenge herself, Lucretia persuades Frank to pose as his sister and to join a ladies' private whipping club, the qualification for admission to which is the applicant's receipt of a whipping.

[[The Who]]'s song "[[I'm a Boy]]" is about a boy forced to wear girls' clothing by his mother.

The '''posterior median line''' is a sagittal line on the posterior torso at the midline.

A similar term is "vertebral line", which defined by the [[spinous process]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/medicine/pulmonar/apd/ap.htm|title=Anatomical Principles|website=Meddean.luc.edu|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this term is not in [[Terminologia Anatomica]].

'''PottersWheel''' is a [[MATLAB]] toolbox for mathematical modeling of time-dependent [[dynamical system]]s that can be expressed as [[chemical reaction network]]s or [[ordinary differential equations]] (ODEs).&lt;ref&gt;T. Maiwald and J. Timmer (2008) "Dynamical Modeling and Multi-Experiment Fitting with PottersWheel", ''Bioinformatics'' 24(18):2037–2043&lt;/ref&gt; It allows the automatic calibration of model parameters by fitting the model to experimental measurements. CPU-intensive functions are written or – in case of model dependent functions – dynamically generated in C. Modeling can be done interactively using graphical user interfaces or based on MATLAB scripts using the PottersWheel function library. The software is intended to support the work of a mathematical modeler as a real [[potter's wheel]] eases the modeling of pottery.

== Seven modeling phases ==

The basic use of PottersWheel covers seven phases from model creation to the prediction of new
experiments.

=== Model creation ===

[[File:Formalization-of-Jak-Stat-Pathway.png]]

The dynamical system is formalized into a set of reactions or differential equations using a visual model designer or a text editor. The model is stored as a MATLAB *.m ASCII file. Modifications can therefore be tracked using a version control system like [[subversion]] or [[Git (software)|git]]. Model import and export is supported for [[SBML]]. Custom import-templates may be used to import custom model structures. [[Rule-based modeling]] is also supported, where a pattern represents a set of automatically generated reactions.

Example for a simple model definition file for a reaction network A → B → C → A with observed species A and C:

&lt;source lang=matlab&gt;
function m = getModel();

% Starting with an empty model
m = pwGetEmtptyModel();

% Adding reactions
m = pwAddR(m, 'A', 'B');
m = pwAddR(m, 'B', 'C');
m = pwAddR(m, 'C', 'A');

% Adding observables
m = pwAddY(m, 'A');
m = pwAddY(m, 'C');
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Data import ===

External data saved in *.xls or *.txt files can be added to a model creating a ''model-data-couple''. A mapping dialog allows to connect data column names to observed species names. Meta information in the data files comprise information about the experimental setting. Measurement errors are either stored in the data files, will be calculated using an error model, or are estimated automatically.

=== Parameter calibration ===

To fit a model to one or more data sets, the corresponding model-data-couples are combined into a ''fitting-assembly''. Parameters like initial values, rate constants, and scaling factors can be fitted in an experiment-wise or global fashion. The user may select from several numerical integrators, optimization algorithms, and calibration strategies like fitting in normal or logarithmic parameter space.

=== Interpretation of the goodness-of-fit ===

[[File:Fitting-data-with-PottersWheel.png]]

The quality of a fit is characterized by its ''chi-squared'' value.  As a rule of thumb, for
''N'' fitted data points and ''p'' calibrated parameters, the chi-squared value should have a similar value
as ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'' or at least&amp;nbsp;''N''. Statistically, this is expressed using a [[chi-squared test]] resulting in a [[p-value]] above a significance threshold of e.g.&amp;nbsp;0.05. For lower p-values, the model is

* either not able to explain the data and has to be refined,
* the standard deviation of the data points is actually larger than specified,
* or the used fitting strategy was not successful and the fit was trapped in a local minimum.

Apart from further chi-squared based characteristics like [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]] and [[Bayesian information criterion|BIC]], data-model-residual analyses exist, e.g. to investigate whether the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] follow a [[Gaussian distribution]]. Finally, parameter [[confidence intervals]] may be estimated using either the [[Fisher information matrix]] approximation or based on the [[profile-likelihood function]], if parameters are not unambiguously identifiable.

If the fit is not acceptable, the model has to be refined and the procedure continues with step 2. Else, the dynamic model properties can be examined and predictions calculated.

=== Model refinement ===

If the model structure is not able to explain the experimental measurements, a set of physiologically reasonable alternative models should be created. In order to avoid redundant model paragraphs and copy-and-paste errors, this can be done using a common core-model which is the same for all variants.  Then, ''daughter''-models are created and fitted to the data, preferably using batch processing strategies based on MATLAB scripts. As a starting point to envision suitable model variants, the PottersWheel ''equalizer'' may be used to understand the dynamic behavior of the original system.

=== Model analysis and prediction ===

A mathematical model may serve to display the concentration time-profile of unobserved species, to determine sensitive parameters representing potential targets within a clinical setting, or to calculate model characteristics like the half-life of a species.

Each analysis step may be stored into a modeling report, which may be exported as a Latex-based PDF.

=== Experimental design ===

An experimental setting corresponds to specific characteristics of ''driving input functions'' and
initial concentrations. In a signal transduction pathway model the concentration of a ligand
like EGF may be controlled experimentally.  The driving input designer allows investigating the effect of a continuous, ramp, or pulse stimulation in combination with varying initial concentrations using the equalizer.  In order to discriminate competing model hypotheses, the designed experiment should have as different observable time-profiles as possible.

== Parameter identifiability ==

Many dynamical systems can only be observed partially, i.e. not all system species are accessible experimentally. For biological applications the amount and quality of experimental data is often limited. In this setting parameters can be structurally or practically non-identifiable. Then, parameters may compensate each other and fitted parameter values strongly depend on initial guesses. In PottersWheel non-identifiability can be detected using the [[Profile Likelihood Approach]].&lt;ref&gt;''Structural and practical identifiability analysis of partially observed dynamical models by exploiting the profile likelihood'', A. Raue, C. Kreutz, T. Maiwald, J. Bachmann, M. Schilling, U. Klingmüller and J. Timmer, Bioinformatics 2009
&lt;/ref&gt; For characterizing functional relationships between the non-identifiable parameters PottersWheel applies random and systematic fit sequences.&lt;ref&gt;''Data-based identifiability analysis of non-linear dynamical models'', S. Hengl, C. Kreutz, J. Timmer and T. Maiwald, Bioinformatics 2007 23(19):2612–2618&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Exploration''' is a not-for-profit educational program whose goal is to "change the face of science" by encouraging interest in science among students—especially girls and minorities—who traditionally have not found effective career routes into scientific disciplines. Its primary method is to create intensive collaborative relationships between students and working field researchers through structured programs involving the [[University of Chicago]] and other institutions. In January 2010, it received a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring.&lt;ref name="press1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-honor-teachers-and-mentors-announce-key-partnerships-educate-innova|title=President Obama to Honor Teachers and Mentors, Announce Key Partnerships in "Educate to Innovate" Campaign|date=January 4, 2010 |publisher=The White House, Office of the Press Secretary|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization, founded in 1999, is based in Chicago, Illinois, USA.

==Activities==
Project Exploration currently serves nearly 1,000 students.  It began as an after-school and summer program when Gabrielle Lyon, a teacher at Fiske Elementary School on the [[South Side of Chicago]], decided that students underrepresented in the sciences, primarily girls and minorities, should be given opportunities to collaborate with actual scientists and participate in real-life scientific research. Students design research projects and test them in the field, or work summers at museums demonstrating science to young children.&lt;ref name="Trib"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2009/jul/17/local/chi-president-award-sciencejul17|title=Chicago-based Project Exploration wins a presidential award for science education|last=Mitchum|first=Robert |date=July 17, 2009|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sisters4Science
Sisters4Science is a year-round after-school and field program that combines science exploration with leadership development for approximately 100 minority middle school girls. Girls participate in hands-on science activities led by women scientists as well as participate in science-based field trips.&lt;ref name="s4s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectexploration.org/s4s/|title=Sisters4Science|publisher=Project Exploration|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Girls Health and Science Day
Project Exploration organizes a one-day symposium with workshops on the topics of sexuality and tolerance, healthy relationships, self-worth, the female body, and self-defense for female students across Chicago in grades 7-10.&lt;ref name="ghsd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectexploration.org/ghsd|title=Girls Health and Science Day|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* All Girls Expedition
The All Girls Expedition is an intensive two-week classroom and field work experience for twenty girls .  It includes intensive classroom instruction in geology, biology, evaluation, and field skills followed by one week working in the field alongside scientists.&lt;ref name="age"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectexploration.org/age/ |title=All Girls Expedition  |publisher=Project Exploration|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent expedition was to [[Yellowstone National Park]] in Wyoming, to conduct fieldwork on the water chemistry of geysers, track [[coyotes]] and explore a cave with Project Exploration and Yellowstone researchers.&lt;ref name="UofChi1"/&gt;

* The Science Teacher Field Institute
The Science Teacher Field Institute is an annual three-week professional development program for Chicago Public School teachers  which includes both classroom and field experience with scientists in the disciplines of geology, paleontology, and [[astronomy]].  All costs are covered by private donations.&lt;ref name="stfi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectexploration.org/stfi/|title=The Science Teacher Field Institute |publisher=Project Exploration|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This program includes field work at eastern [[Montana]]'s Lost-in-Time Ranch under supervision of professional paleontologists from the University of Chicago and Project co-founder Gabrielle Lyon.&lt;ref name="UofChi1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.uchicago.edu/news.php?asset_id=1644|title=Project Exploration offers mammoth-scale summer learning experience|date=25 June 2009|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential Award==
The Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, awarded each year to individuals or organizations, recognizes the crucial role that mentoring plays in the academic and personal development of students studying science or engineering and who belong to minorities that are underrepresented in those fields. By offering their time, encouragement and expertise to these students, mentors help ensure that the next generation of scientists and engineers will better reflect the diversity of the United States.
Candidates for the Presidential Mentoring Award are nominated by colleagues, administrators, and students from their home institutions.  The mentoring can involve students at any grade level from elementary through graduate school. In addition to being honored at the [[White House]], recipients receive awards of $10,000 to advance their mentoring efforts. "There is no higher calling than furthering the educational advancement of our nation’s young people and encouraging and inspiring our next generation of leaders," [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] said. "These awards represent a heartfelt salute of appreciation to a remarkable group of individuals who have devoted their lives and careers to helping others and in doing so have helped us all."&lt;ref name="whitehouse2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Honors-Outstanding-Science-Math-Engineering-Teachers-And-Mentors/|title=President Honors Outstanding Science Math Engineering Teachers And Mentors/|date=9 July 2009|publisher=The White House, Office of the Press Secretary|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award to Project Exploration was announced in July 2009.&lt;ref name="Trib" /&gt; The award ceremony took place in January 2010 at the White House.

The '''Pulpit Commentary''' is a [[homiletic]] commentary on the [[Bible]] created during the nineteenth century under the direction of Rev. Joseph S. Exell and Henry Donald Maurice Spence-Jones. It consists of 23 volumes with 22,000 pages and 95,000 entries, and was written over a 30-year period with 100 contributors.

Rev. Joseph S. Exell M.A. served as the editor of ''Clerical World'', ''The Homiletical Quarterly'' and the ''Monthly Interpreter''. Exell was also the editor for several other large commentary sets like ''The Men of the Bible'', ''The Preacher's Homiletic Library'' and ''The Biblical Illustrator''. [[Donald Spence Jones|Henry Donald Maurice Spence-Jones]] was the Vicar and [[Rural Dean]] of [[St. Pancras, London]] and the principal of Gloucester Theological College.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6191">'''Query by Example''' ('''QBE''') is a [[database]] [[query language]] for [[relational database]]s. It was devised by [[Moshé M. Zloof]] at [[IBM Research]] during the mid-1970s, in parallel to the development of [[SQL]]. It is the first graphical query language, using visual tables where the user would enter commands, example elements and conditions. Many graphical front-ends for databases use the ideas from QBE today. Originally limited only for the purpose of [[data retrieval|retrieving data]], QBE was later extended to allow other operations, such as inserts, deletes and updates, as well as creation of temporary tables.

The motivation behind QBE is that a [[parser]] can convert the user's actions into statements expressed in a database manipulation language, such as [[SQL]].  Behind the scenes, it is this statement that is actually executed. A suitably comprehensive front-end can minimize the burden on the user to remember the finer details of SQL, and it is easier and more productive for end-users (and even programmers) to select tables and columns by selecting them rather than typing in their names,

In the context of [[information retrieval]], QBE has a somewhat different meaning. The user can submit a document, or several documents, and ask for "similar" documents to be retrieved from a document database [see search by multiple examples&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Mingzhu|last2=Wu|first2=Yi-Fang Brook|date=2014-02-24|title=Search by multiple examples|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2556195.2556206|publisher=ACM|pages=667–672|doi=10.1145/2556195.2556206|isbn=9781450323512}}&lt;/ref&gt;]. Similarity search is based comparing document vectors (see [[Vector Space Model]]).

QBE is a seminal work in [[end-user development]], frequently cited in research papers as an early example of this topic.

Currently, QBE is supported in several relational database front ends, notably Microsoft Access, which implements "Visual Query by Example", as well as Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Manager. It is also implemented in several [[object database|object-oriented databases]] (e.g. in [[db4o]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-db4o2.html | contribution = QBE | title = db4o | publisher = IBM | series = Developer works Java library}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

QBE is based on the logical formalism called [[tableau query]], although QBE adds some extensions to that, much like SQL is based on the [[relational algebra]].

== Example ==
An example using the [[Suppliers and Parts database]] is given here to illustrate how QBE works.

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Simple QBE example
! S !! S# !! SNAME !! OWNER !! SCITY
|-
| || P.&lt;u&gt;SX&lt;/u&gt; || || J. DOE || ROME
|}

== As a general technique ==
The term also refers to a general technique influenced by Zloof's work whereby only items with search values are used to "filter" the results. It provides a way for a software user to perform queries without having to know a query language (such as [[SQL]]). The software can automatically generate the queries for the user (usually behind the scenes). Here are some examples:

Example Form '''B''':
 .....Name: Bob
 ..Address:
 .....City:
 ....State: TX
 ..Zipcode:

Resulting [[SQL]]:
&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT * FROM Contacts WHERE Name='Bob' AND State='TX';
&lt;/source&gt;
Note how blank  items do not generate [[SQL]] terms. Since "Address" is blank, there is no clause generated for it.
For
Example Form '''C''':
 .....Name: 
 ..Address:
 .....City: Sampleton
 ....State: 
 ..Zipcode: 12345

Resulting [[SQL]]:
&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT * FROM Contacts WHERE City='Sampleton' AND Zipcode='12345';
&lt;/source&gt;
More advanced versions of QBE have other comparison operator options, often via a pull-down menu, such as "Contains", "Not Contains", "Starts With", "Greater-Than", and so forth.

Another approach to text comparisons is to allow one or more [[wildcard character]] characters. For example, if an asterisk is designated as a wild wildcard character in a particular system, then searching for last names using "Rob'''*'''" would return (match) last names such as "Rob", "Robert", "Robertson", "Roberto", etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1266">'''Radappertization''' is a form of [[food irradiation]] which applies a dose of [[ionizing radiation]] sufficient to reduce the number and activity of viable [[microorganism]]s to such an extent that very few, if any, are detectable in the treated food by any recognized method ([[virus]]es being excepted). No [[Microorganism|microbial]] spoilage or [[toxicity]] should become detectable in a food so treated, regardless of the conditions under which it is stored, provided the packaging remains undamaged. The required dose is usually in the range of 25-45 [[Gray (unit)|kiloGrays]].&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Diehl, ''Safety of Irradiated Foods,'' Marcel Dekker, 1995, p. 99 ff. some interpretation of the meaning of this new terminology is available&lt;/ref&gt;

Radappertized foods packaged correctly will keep indefinitely.

Radappertization is derived from the combination of ''rad''iation and [[Nicolas François Appert|Appert]], the name of the French scientist and engineer who invented [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] food for the troops of [[Napoleon]].

A '''sign system''' is a key concept in [[semiotics]] and is used to refer to any system of [[sign (semiotics)|signs]] and relations between signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beynon-Davies P.|year=2010|title=Dances with bees: exploring the relevance of the study of animal communication to informatics|journal=International Journal of Information Management|volume=30|number=1|pages=185–198|doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2010.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[language]]'' is frequently used as a synonym for a sign-system. However, the term ''sign-system'' is preferable to the term ''language'' for a number of reasons. First, the use of the term ''language'' tends to carry with it [[connotation]]s of human language, particularly human spoken language. Human spoken language is only one example of a sign-system; albeit probably one of the most complex sign-systems known.

For example, in traditional forms of face-to-face communication, humans communicate through [[non-verbal communication|non-verbal]] as well as verbal sign-systems; colloquially, this can be referred to as [[body language]]. Hence, humans communicate a great deal by way of facial movements and other forms of bodily expression. Such expressions are also signs and an organised collection of such signs would be considered a sign system. Second, the same concept of a sign-system can be used in considering a vast range of  communication forms such as [[animal communication]] and [[Man-machine interface|man-machine communication]]. Examination of simpler forms of such systems of signs within non-human communication can help to illuminate some of the essence of [[communication]] and in particular can help to provide tentative answers to the question of the nature and function of communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12179">'''Sound studies''' is an interdisciplinary field that to date has focused largely on the emergence of the concept of "sound" in Western modernity, with an emphasis on the development of sound reproduction technologies. The field first emerged in venues like the journal ''Social Studies of Science'' by scholars working in [[science and technology studies]] and [[communication studies]]; it has however greatly expanded and now includes a broad array of scholars working in music, anthropology, [[sound art]], [[deaf studies]], [[architecture]], and many other fields besides. Important studies have focused on the idea of a "soundscape", architectural acoustics, nature sounds, the history of aurality in [[Western philosophy]] and nineteenth-century Colombia, Islamic approaches to listening, the voice, studies of deafness, loudness, and related topics. A foundational text is Jonathan Sterne's 2003 book "The Audible Past", though the field has retroactively taken as foundational two texts from 1977, [[Jacques Attali]]'s "Noise" and [[R. Murray Schafer]]'s "The Soundscape".

Initial work in the field was criticized for focusing mainly on white male inventors in Euro-America. Consequently the field is currently in a period of expansion, with important texts coming out in recent years on sound, listening, and hearing as they relate to blackness, gender, and [[colonialism]].

==Hearing and listening==

Two significant categories to what we hear and pay attention to are natural and technological sounds. According to R. Murray Schaeffer (through a survey of quotes in the literature), the proportion of nature sounds heard and noticed among European authors has decreased over the past two centuries from 43% to 20%, but not for North America, where it has stayed around 50%. Additionally, the proportion of technological sounds mentioned in literature has stayed around 35% for Europe, but decreased in North America. While technological increases have not been sonically noticed, the decrease in silence has been noticed, from 19% to 9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schafer|first1=R. Murray|title=The Soundscape: Our Sonic Environment and the Tuning of the World|date=1994|publisher=Destiny Books|location=Rochester, Vermont|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the idea of listening, objects can be considered auditorily as compared to visually. The objects that are able to be experienced by sight and by sound can be thought of in a [[venn diagram]], with mute and visible objects in the vision category, with aural and invisible objects in the sound category, and aural and visible objects in the overlapping category. Objects that do not fall into a specific category can be considered beyond the horizons of sound and sight. The common denominator for aural objects is movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ihde|first1=Don|title=Listening and Voice: A Phenomenology of Sound|date=1974|publisher=Ohio University Press|location=Athens|pages=49–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three modes of listening have been recognized; causal listening, semantic listening, and reduced listening. Causal listening, the most common, consists of listening in order to gather ideas about its source. Sound in this case is informational and can be used to recognize voices, determine distance, or understand differences between humans and machines. Semantic listening is when a sound is not only heard but also processed. When a sound is given meaning and context, as seen in speech and fluent dialogue. Reduced listening focuses on the traits of the sound itself regardless of cause and meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chion|first1=Michel|title=Audio Vision: Sound on Screen|date=1990|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=48–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spaces, sites and scapes==

Sound is heard through space. But this defining of sound and space is further nuanced by their interdependent existence, creation, and dissolution. This idea of the acoustic environment and its social inextricability has become a source of interest within the field of sound studies. Critical to this contemporary discussion of the symbiotic social space and sonic space is R. Murray Schafer's concept of the soundscape. Schafer uses the term soundscape to describe "a total appreciation of the sonic environment," and, through soundscape studies, attempts to more holistically understand "the relationship between man and the sounds of his environment and what happens when those sounds change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schafer|first1=R. Murray|title=The Soundscape: Our Sonic Environment and the Tuning of the World|date=1994|publisher=Destiny Books|location=Rochester, Vermont|pages=8, 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In understanding the environment as events being heard, the soundscape is indicative of the social conditions and characteristics that create it. In industrialized cities, the soundscape is industrial noises, in a rainforest the soundscape is the sound of nature, and in an empty space the soundscape is silence. Moreover, the soundscape is argued to foretell future societal trends. The soundscape is not just representative of the environment which surrounds it but it makes up its very essence. The soundscape is the environment on a wavelength that is auditory rather than tactile or visible, but very much as real.

Schaffer's concept of the soundscape has become a hallmark of sound studies and is referenced, built upon, and criticized by writers from a wide breadth of disciplines and perspectives. Common themes explored through the analysis of the soundscape are the conflict between nature and industry, the impact of technology on sound production and consumption, the issue of cultural sound values and the evolution of acoustics, and the power dynamics of silence and noise.

==Transduce and record==

Our perception of a recorded sound's authenticity has been greatly impacted by the commercial influence of capitalism. Even the dead now profit from recordings they've made, making music more timeless than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanyek|first1=Jason|last2=Piekut|first2=Benjamin|title=Deadness: Technologies of the Intermundane|date=2010|pages=14–21 &amp; 27–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bringing the past into the present generates a sense of familiarity which compels the public to engage in new forms of listening.

In a Memorex commercial involving Ella Fitzgerald and Chuck Mangione, Fitzgerald is unable to discern the difference between a live performance and a recording of Mangione playing the trumpet. This presents a scene to viewers which sells cassette tapes as ideal objects of high-fidelity, auditory preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowitt|first1=John|title=The Sound of Music in the Era of its Electronic Reproducibility|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|pages=184–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was once an autonomic experience of memory which integrated visual and auditory stimuli (live music) has become a consumable item which popularizes and commodifies sonic memory explicitly.

Part of this shift in the dynamics of recorded sound has to do with a desire for noise reduction. This desire is representative of a mode of recording referred to by scholar James Lastra as "telephonic:" a mode in which sound is regarded as having hierarchically important qualities, with clarity and intelligibility being the most important aspects. This contrasts with phonographic recording, which generates a "point of audition" from which a sense of space can be derived, sacrificing quality for uniqueness and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lastra|first1=James|title=Sound Theory. "Fidelity Versus Intelligibility"|date=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=138–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is often used in movies to demonstrate how a character hears something (such as muffled voices through a closed door). Through various forms of media, recorded music affects our perceptions and consumptive practices more often than we realize.

The '''stable ocean hypothesis''' (SOH) is one of several hypotheses within larval fish [[ecology]] that attempt to explain recruitment variability (Figure 1;&lt;ref name="northwestern1"&gt;Houde, E. 2008. Emerging from Hjort’s shadow. Journal of Northwestern Atlantic Fisheries Science 41:53-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Table 1). The SOH is the notion that favorable and somewhat stable physical and biological [[ocean]] conditions, such as the flow of [[current (ocean)|current]]s and [[food]] availability, are important to the survival of young fish larvae and their future recruitment. In the presence of stable ocean conditions, concentrations of [[prey]] form in stratified ocean layers; more specifically, stable ocean conditions refer to “calm periods in [[upwelling]] [[ecosystem]]s (sometimes called 'Lasker events')” that cause the [[water column]] to become vertically stratified.&lt;ref name="northwestern1"/&gt; The concept is that these strata concentrate both fish larvae and [[plankton]], which results an increase of the fish larvae feeding because of the density-dependent increase in [[predator-prey interaction]]s. [[Reuben Lasker|Lasker]] is attributed with constructing this hypothesis in the late 1970s &lt;ref name="recruitment80"&gt;Lasker, R. 1981.

To support this hypothesis, Reuben Lasker cited the disconnect between spawning stock [[biomass]] and the recruitment of numerous fish species.&lt;ref name="hydrgraphische1997"&gt;Dippner, J. W. 1997. Recruitment success of different fish stocks in the North Sea in relation to climate variability. Deutsche Hydrgraphische Zeitschrift 49 (2-3): 277-293.&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation of this disconnect suggests larval recruitment is influenced by spatial and temporal patterns of their food, like [[phytoplankton]] or [[zooplankton]], which can be greatly affected by ocean currents and mixing.&lt;ref&gt;Haury, L. R., McGowan, J. A., and Wiebe, P. H. 1978. Patterns and processes in the time-space scales of plankton distribution. Spatial Pattern in Plankton Communities (ed. J. H. Steele), p. 277-327. Plenum, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In his publication Marine fish larvae: Morphology, ecology, and relation to fisheries (1981), he points out, for example, the [[Peru]]vian [[anchovy]] fishery collapse that resulted from a dramatic decrease in population size during the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Valdivia, G., J. E. 1978. The anchoveta and El Niño. Rapp. P. –v. Réun. Cons. Int. Explor. Mer 173:196-202.&lt;/ref&gt;  Officials and researchers from the [[Peruvian government]] and [[United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization]] submitted that the causal factors were a combination of strong fishing pressure and weak year classes that resulted in insufficient reproduction and recruitment to support the [[fishery]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, G. T. (chairman). 1974. Report of the fourth session of the panel of experts on stock assessment on Peruvian anchoveta. Instituto del Mar del Peru (Callao), Boletin 2:605-719.&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation seemed to explain the diminished population trends of similar species from other regions, including the [[Pacific sardine|Pacific]] and Japanese [[sardine]]s and the Atlanto-Scandian [[herring]].&lt;ref name="recruitment80"/&gt;

Lasker, however, opposed this conclusion while citing the seemingly miraculous recovery of the troubled Japanese sardine population from scarcity (e.g. thousands of landed tons) to prominent abundance (e.g. more than a million landed tons).&lt;ref name="recruitment80"/&gt;  Another researcher studying the rebound of the Japanese sardine, Kondo (1980), identified an unusually strong 1972-year class, which produced successful recruitments in the years that followed. Kondo also noted altered ocean current patterns that increased zooplankton availability in spatiotemporal coincidence with the hatching of the sardine larvae.&lt;ref name="recruitment80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fluctuations1980"&gt;Kondo, K. 1980. The recovery of the Japanese Sardine – the biological basis of stock-size fluctuations. Rapp. P.-v. Reun. Cons. Int. Explor. Mer. 177:322-354.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was increased larval survival and the eventual rebound of the population.&lt;ref name="recruitment80"/&gt; Thus, the observed trend is that strong year class anomalies can have major impacts on population sizes and their future stability and growth.&lt;ref name="hydrgraphische1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fluctuations1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hjort, J. 1926. Fluctuations in the year classes of important food fishes. Cons. Perm. Int. Explor. Mer, Journ. Du Cons., 1:5-38.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept also illustrates how plankton abundance and ocean currents can be driving factors associated with such trends.&lt;ref name="hydrgraphische1997"/&gt; Clearly, these patterns become important when considering the predictive models necessary to manage and sustain important fisheries and the stocks that support them.

==Experimental support==
Lasker also conducted studies using first-feeding anchovy larvae (during their critical period or the nutritional source transition from yolk sac to external food sources in very young larvae) to further test and eventually support his ideas.&lt;ref name="theilacker1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chlorophyll1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="proportions329"/&gt; During one at-sea experiment, Lasker introduced water derived from various oceanic layers containing natural assortments of plankton as prey for the young anchovy larvae.

He observed that anchovy larvae would first feed only when introduced to layers from below the surface containing high levels of [[chlorophyll]] and certain species of phytoplankton.&lt;ref name="theilacker1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chlorophyll1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="proportions329"/&gt;&lt;ref name="southward84"&gt;Blaxter, J. H. S. and A. J. Southward. 1992. Advances in Marine Biology, Vol. 28, p.84 -85. Academic Press Limited, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt; These feeding-suitable phytoplankton assemblages were correlated with non-mixing [[thermocline]] layers. This conjecture was supported when foul weather swept up during the study and mixed the previously stratified layers (including a particulate layer below the surface) that had been sampled and introduced to the larvae. Samples derived from the same depths that proved ideal to induce first feeding prior to the storm no longer contained the necessary phytoplankton varieties and abundances; as a result, the young larvae did not feed on the post-storm samples and were unable to survive. Thus, Lasker eventually hypothesized that high-energy events that cause destratification of ocean layers have negative impacts on first-feeding northern anchovy larvae by destabilizing and decreasing their prey availability.&lt;ref name="recruitment80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="southward84"/&gt;

==Conditions and controversy==
In the book ''Advances in Marine Biology'', Heath (1992) astutely outlines some of the limitations and [[controversy]] associated with the SOH.&lt;ref&gt;Blaxter and Southward, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Three major limiting conditions include, but are not limited to:
# Species- and region-specific: SOH is based primarily on experimental studies of Pacific anchovy in the [[California Current|California current system]] (CCS) and should, therefore, be used cautiously when extrapolating to other species and regions.&lt;ref name="theilacker1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chlorophyll1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="proportions329"/&gt;
# Life-stage specific: Lasker’s suggestion that storms ultimately have negative impacts on first-feeding anchovy larvae should come with the disclaimer that this applies only to first-feeding larvae entering the critical period. Older anchovy larvae can, in fact, be positively affected by storm activity, which often prompts increases in planktonic production.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin, M. M., E. R. Brooks, F. M. H. Reid, J. Napp, and E. F. Stewart. 1985. Vertical structure of nearshore plankton off southern California: a storm and a larval fish food web. Fish Bull. 83(2):151-170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wroblewski, J. S., J. G. Richman, and G. L. Mellor. 1989. Optimal wind condition for the survival of larval northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax: a modeling investigation. Fish Bull., U.S. 87:387-395.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Does not consider storm-absent survival of larvae: Admittedly, one study supported the SOH by documenting a correlation between increased daily [[mortality rate]]s of first-feeding anchovy larvae and intervals of unperturbed, storm-absent conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Peterman, R. M. and M. J. Bradford. 1987. Wind speed and mortality rate of a marine fish, the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). Science 235:354-356.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it is important to realize, as Peterman and Bradford did, that all this evidence does not affirm a certain relationship between larval survival and [[severe weather]]; this is particularly true given the lack of data regarding larval survival in the absence of storm events for context and comparison. Furthermore, Peterman and Bradford (1987) did not find a strong relationship between the larval survival rates documented adjacent to wind/storm events and recruitment levels observed months afterward.&lt;ref name="northwestern1"/&gt;

==Conclusions and modern perspective==
Lasker’s SOH and the many other explanations of recruitment in larval variability are certainly relevant. However, current consensus is that larval recruitment and survival are, to some extent, dependent upon all of these processes and more;&lt;ref name="northwestern1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, J. H., JR.,, and R. F. Shaw. 2002. Recruitment. In: Fishery science: the unique contributions of early life stages. L. A. Fuiman and R. G. Werner (eds.). Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, p. 88-11.&lt;/ref&gt; physical oceanography, prey, dispersal, and settlement/habitat are all very important factors, but predation,&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, K. M., and E. D. Houde. 1989. Predation on eggs and larvae of marine fishes and the recruitment problem. Adv. Mar. Biol. 25: 1-83.&lt;/ref&gt; temperature,&lt;ref&gt;Francis, M. P. 1993.

Netherlands Journal of Zoology 42:336-357.&lt;/ref&gt; etc. are other key aspects affecting recruitment.&lt;ref name="northwestern1"/&gt; Excellent research focusing on early life history and larval recruitment mechanisms was done from 1960–1990, and this body of research, including Lasker’s, laid the basis for larval ecology studies today. Presently, researchers around the world continue to study larval recruitment processes, but they still refer to the founding concepts written many years ago.

'''Tourism geography''' is the study of [[travel]] and [[tourism]], as an industry and as a [[social]] and [[culture|cultural]] activity. Tourism geography covers a wide range of interests including the environmental [[impacts of tourism|impact of tourism]], the geographies of tourism and leisure economies, answering tourism industry and management concerns and the sociology of tourism and locations of tourism.

Tourism geography is that branch of science which deals with the study of travel and its impact on places.

[[Geography]] is fundamental to the study of tourism, because tourism is geographical in nature. Tourism occurs in places, it involves movement and activities between places and it is an activity in which both place characteristics and personal self-identities are formed, through the relationships that are created among places, landscapes and people. Physical geography provides the essential background, against which tourism places are created and environmental impacts and concerns are major issues, that must be considered in managing the development of tourism places.

The approaches to study will differ according to the varying concerns. Much tourism management literature remains [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] in methodology and considers tourism as consisting of the places of tourist origin (or tourist generating areas), tourist destinations (or places of tourism supply) and the relationship (connections) between origin and destination places, which includes transportation routes, business relationships and traveler motivations.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, A and Crang, M (2001) 'The trouble with tourism and travel theory?' in ''Tourist Studies'' 1(5) p.5-22&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments in [[human geography]] have resulted in approaches such as those from [[cultural geography]], which take more theoretically diverse approaches to tourism, including a sociology of tourism, which extends beyond tourism as an isolated, exceptional activity and considering how travel fits into the everyday lives and how tourism is not only a consumptive of places, but also produces the [[sense of place]] at a destination.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, J, Urry, J and Axhausen, K (2006) ''Mobilities, Networks, Geographies'' Aldershot:Ashgate&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Tourist'' by Dean MacCannell and ''The Tourist Gaze'' by [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]] are classics in this field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">A '''train-and-equip program''' is a military operation in which one country provides [[Military education and training|training]] and [[Military technology|equipment]] to an [[Allies|ally]]. The practice typically involves the transfer of expertise and materiel from a stronger military to a weaker one, as an alternative to fighting together outright. The [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] has run several train-and-equip programs in recent [[military history]].
__NOTOC__
==Bosnia==
During the [[Bosnian War]], American president [[Bill Clinton]] and Bosnian president [[Alija Izetbegović]] agreed to a train-and-equip program for Bosnia, valued at an estimated $500 million [[United States Dollar|USD]]. American diplomat [[James W. Pardew]] oversaw the implementation of the plan. The Bosnian Train and Equip Program was carried out in a multi-agency effort over the course of two years and led to a reduction of military tensions between warring factions in the country and removed foreign extremist influence from the political process.It is widely considered a success in securing the peace in Bosnia and allowing the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] partners to responsibly extract themselves from the conflict. &lt;ref&gt;The Bosnian Train and Equip Program: A Lesson in Interagency Integration of Hard and Soft Power
