'''Age segregation''' is the separation of people based on their [[Ageing|age]], and may be observed in many aspects of some societies.&lt;ref&gt;L Steinberg, ''Adolescence'' (4th edition, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of institutionalized age segregation include [[age segregation in schools]], and [[age-segregated housing]].There are studies of informal age segregation among [[adolescent]]s.&lt;ref name="springer1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montemayor|first=Raymond|last2=Komen|first2=Roger Van|date=1980-10-01|title=Age segregation of adolescents in and out of school|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02087675|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|language=en|volume=9|issue=5|pages=371–381|doi=10.1007/BF02087675|issn=0047-2891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OiyN52CQgbcC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=%22age+segregation%22+adolescents&amp;source=web&amp;ots=d2dX349Neu&amp;sig=clyC0WKSkHUH_6Q3oLdzDMyr-qc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result|title=Evolutionary Principles of Human Adolescence|last=Weisfeld|first=Glenn|date=1999-05-31|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780813333182|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Age segregation in schools, age grading, or graded education is the separation of [[student]]s into years of education ([[educational stages|grade]]s, [[form (education)|form]]s) by approximately the same [[Ageing|age]].

In the [[United States]], graded education was introduced during 1848 to 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Dean McClusky, "Introduction of Grading into the Public Schools of New England, Part II", ''The Elementary School Journal'', Vol. 21, No. 2 (October 1920), pp. 132-145&lt;/ref&gt;Age segregation in the U.S. was a product of industrialization, Western formal schooling, [[child labor]] laws, social services agencies, and the rise of disciplines such as psychology and education. A combination of these caused a shift from family working as a unit to separation of economic activities and childcare emerged.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rogoff, B., Glida, M. and Chavajay, P. (2010). Children's Integration in Communities and Segregation From People of Differing Ages. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 5(4), pp.431-440&lt;/ref&gt; Some communities have different cultural practices and [[Child Integration|integrate children]] into mature activities of the family and community. This is common among Indigenous American communities.

Age segregation is seen by some like Peter Uhlenberg and Jenny Gierveld to benefit individuals by bringing like-minded individuals together to share similar facilities, network and information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Uhlenberg|first1=Peter|last2=Gierveld|first2=Jenny|date=28 January 2004|title=Age-segregation in later life: an examination of personal networks|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/S0144686X0300151X|journal=Ageing and Society|volume=24(1)|pages=5-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elderly are however disadvantaged by segregation in that they risk being excluded from economic and social developments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Effects of Age Segregation==

Researchers have argued that age grading in school has significant impact on age segregation among adolescent [[peer group]]s.&lt;ref name="springer1" /&gt; It is also present in the work force, which can make it more difficult for older adults to find jobs or change employment paths because of their age. They are often either expected to have a significantly larger background of experience in the field, or be far enough away from retirement to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;Pekka Ilmakunnas, Seija Ilmakunnas, (2014) "Age segregation and hiring of older employees: low mobility revisited", , Vol. 35 Issue: 8, pp.1090-1115, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1108/IJM-04-2012-0060&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although seen less in younger adults and children, there is evidence{{Specify}} that younger populations segregate within themselves. Until around ages 7 and 8, children tend to only associate with people within 2 years of their own age. Children mostly segregate from adults, showing less adult interaction as they move into their teenage and young adult years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Shari|last2=Rogoff|first2=Barbara|last3=Cromer|first3=Cindy C.|date=1981|title=Age segregation in children's social interactions.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/dev/17/4/399|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=17|issue=4|pages=399–407|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.17.4.399|issn=0012-1649}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that the gap in age segregation will grow because of technological knowledge seen in younger adults that is not seen in older adults. It is predicted that younger adults will have to teach older adults about new social environments that will be essential to healthy living. Without these teachings, age segregation is set to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uhlenberg|first=Peter|last2=Gierveld|first2=Jenny De Jong|date=January 2004|title=Age-segregation in later life: an examination of personal networks|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ageing-and-society/article/agesegregation-in-later-life-an-examination-of-personal-networks/C28132E72D8B6AC52D4FE7730F5B8916|journal=Ageing &amp;amp; Society|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=5–28|doi=10.1017/S0144686X0300151X|issn=1469-1779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the prospects for designing social life to overcome the entrenched practices of age segregation and the cultural assumptions through  the life course is through a steady flock of opportunities for cross-age interaction, some settings facilitate age-integrated social relations. The most distinguished  example is the family, in which children, parents, and grandparents frequently develop close cross-age relationships. Age relations within families vary across cultures and subcultures. According to Uhlenberg and Gierveld, many lower class black families in the United States have high levels of interaction with kin, and older adults. This often provides significant care for younger members in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A statistical analysis of survey data of a survey data for 390 elderly people living  in studio apartments found that age-segregation have a humongous impact on the quality of life of the elderly people because the perception of the elderly in relation to factors that are most outstanding  to their quality of life is at variance with that of the policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hdb.gov.sg/|title=Homepage|last=|first=|date=|website=Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB)|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== United States of America ===
In the United States some portions of a person's life involves being with the same age cohort.  Industrialization brought an increased specialization of all kinds, and age was an important category used to sort people. Society expected teachers to be experts on a particular age group, family members to specialize in different kinds of work, and people to move through major life roles in a fixed pattern. The work force involvement of older women and men declined, and it was replaced by leisure retirement. Martin Kohli argues that over the length of the twentieth century, age was  enormously used to assign people to or prohibit them from particular activities. The result was a tendency toward a firmly fixed life course. According to Riley and Riley, this tendency toward age-segregated structures began to approximate the age-differentiated "ideal type" structure in which people gain their education when young, work in middle-age, and enjoy their well-earned leisure time when they are old. Age-based grades, teams, jobs, and leisure activities seemed normal; people were expected to spend major portions of their days and lives with people of their own age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/age-integration-and-age-segregation|title=Age Integration and Age Segregation|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia.com, Encyclopedia of Aging|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 article for ''[[Perspectives on Psychological Science]]'', authors Rogoff et al state that age-segregated housing can hold some advantages for the elderly such as a higher chance of having more things in common with their peers. This segregation can also decrease their involvement with societies that are preoccupied with the desirability of youth and give them the ability to discuss their fears of death and the frequent deaths of others. Some retirement villages are heavily secured, which can give the elders a sense of safety and protection. An older person is more likely to be noticed in an age segregated community if he or she is in need of help. The elderly people living in such a community also receive lower rates because of the quantity of similar goods and services needed by their communities. Some of the disadvantages of age-segregated housing are isolation from mainstream society, preventing older people from sharing wisdom and experiences with younger people and leading old people to have restricted sets of friendships and neighbors. In some elderly people age-segregated housing can contribute to low morale and feelings of uselessness and rejection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''agung''' is a set of two wide-rimmed, vertically suspended [[gong]]s used by the [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanao]], [[Maranao]], [[Sama-Bajau]] and [[Tausūg people|Tausug]] people of the [[Philippines]] as a supportive instrument in [[kulintang|kulintang ensembles]]. The agung is also ubiquitous among other groups found in [[Palawan]], [[Panay]], [[Mindoro]], [[Mindanao]], [[Sabah]], [[Sulawesi]], [[Sarawak]] and [[Kalimantan]] as an integral part of the [[Agung#In agung ensembles|agung orchestra]].&lt;ref name=Philip&gt;{{cite web | last = Mercurio | first = Philip Dominguez | year = 2006 | url = http://www.pnoyandthecity.blogspot.com | title = Traditional Music of the Southern Philippines | work = PnoyAndTheCity: A center for Kulintang - A home for Pasikings  | accessdate = 15 February 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060228102028/http://www.pnoyandthecity.blogspot.com/| archivedate= 28 February 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:Agung 02.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The agung. The left gong is the ''pangandungan'', used for basic beats. The right gong is the ''panentekan'', which complements the pangandungan.]]
The agung is a large, heavy, wide-rimmed gong shaped like a kettle gong. of the agung produces a [[Bass (sound)|bass]] sound in the kulintang orchestra and weighs between 13 and 16 pounds, but it is possible to find agungs weigh as low as 5 pounds or as high as 20 or 30 pounds each, depending on the metal ([[bronze]], [[brass]] or [[iron]]) used to produce them.

Though their diameters are smaller than the gandingan’s, at roughly {{convert|22|in|mm}} to {{convert|24|in|mm}} in length, they have a much deeper turned-in ''takilidan'' (rim) than the latter, with a width of 12 to 13&amp;nbsp;inches (330&amp;nbsp;mm) including the knob.&lt;ref name=Hila&gt;{{cite web | last = Hila | first = Antonio C | year = 2006 | url = http://www.filipinoheritage.com/arts/phil-music/pre-colonial-indigenous-music.htm | title = Indigenous Music - Tuklas Sining: Essays on the Philippine Arts | work = Filipino Heritage.com | publisher = Tatak Pilipino  | accessdate = 15 November 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061208033505/http://filipinoheritage.com/arts/phil-music/pre-colonial-indigenous-music.htm| archivedate= 8 December 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spark&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.kqed.org/arts/people/spark/profile.jsp?id=4324 | title = Danongan Kalanduyan | work = Spark| publisher = KQED - Arts and Culture  | accessdate = 15 November 2006

The larger, lower pitched gong of the two is called the ''pangandungan'' by the Maguindanao and the ''p'nanggisa-an'' by the Maranao. Played on the musician's right, it provides the main part, which it predominantly played on the accents of the rhythmic structure.

The smaller, higher pitched gong, the thicker of the two, is called the ''panentekan'' by the Maguindanao and the ''p'malsan'' or ''pumalsan'' by the Maranao.

==Origins==
Scholars seem to agree that the origins of the ''agung'' are in [[Indonesia]], noting that the word ''agung/agong'' is derived from the [[Malay language|Malay]]  ''agong'' and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]/[[Javanese language|Javanese]]  ''ageng''.&lt;ref name=Cadar1/&gt;

Further evidence of this comes from a British explorer, [[Thomas Forrest (navigator)|Thomas Forrest]], who in the 1770s wrote Filipinos were “fond of musical gongs which came from [[Cirebon|Cheribon]] on [[Java]] and have round knobs on them.”&lt;ref name=Forrest&gt;Forrest, Thomas. A Voyage to New Guinea and the Moluccas: 1774-1776. Kuala Lumper: Oxford University Press, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[Image:Agung 07.JPG|thumb|right|An agung player demonstrating the new technique of katinengka with his beater.]]
The agung is usually performed while standing beside the instrument, holding the upper edge of its [[flange]] between the thumb and other fingers with the left hand while striking the knob with the right hand. The mallets, called ''balu'', are made from short sticks about half a foot in length and padded with soft but tough material such as rubber at one end. Using these balus, players handle the agung similar to the way a brass tom-tom is played.&lt;ref name=Philip/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hila/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aga/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dria/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garfias/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cadar1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yoshitaka/&gt;

A series of solid, fast decaying sounds are produced using dampening techniques. The desired effect is produced after striking the knob, by leaving one’s hand or knee or the mallets themselves on it.&lt;ref name=Garfias/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cadar1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jager/&gt; When one player is using two gongs, the assistant holding the lower-pitched gong positions it at an angle and dampens its surface using their hands.

Recently, new ways of handling the agung have emerged, including grasping a portion of the boss rather than the flange to dampen or using regular strokes upon the busel while striking the surrounding gong surface with the opposite, wooden end of the beater. The latter technique, called ''katinengka'', is used by downriver musicians to produce metallic sounds during kulintang performances.&lt;ref name=Benitez/&gt;

Different combinations of players, gongs and mallets can be used for playing the agung: two players with each assigned their own gong or just one. When playing alone, the agung player could either play both gongs with the player holding the higher-pitched gongs face-to-face,&lt;ref name=Scholz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Danny/&gt; with the lower one held at an angle by an assistant for stability,&lt;ref name=Philip/&gt; or just one gong. The latter style, common among downriver Maguindanaos in Simuay, who consider this style an old one, uses only the higher-pitch gong for it, unlike the lower-pitched gong, is considered the lead gong, therefore having primary importance. An example of this is when single gong agungs are used during a tagunggo piece.&lt;ref name=Benitez/&gt;

The number of mallets used by the player could also vary as well. For most occasions, only one mallet is used but for other techniques, the player could use two mallets, one in each hand. An even more interesting technique uses only one balu but requires the player to play the agung in reverse order of pitches. Called patuy,&lt;ref name=Danny/&gt; this technique and the one with two mallets are normally reserved only for competition and exhibition instances.&lt;ref name=Philip/&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:Agung 04.jpg|thumb|right|Playing the agung as part of the kulintang ensemble]]

===Kulintang ensemble===
The main use for the agung in Maguindanao and Maranao society is as a supportive/accompanying instrument of an orthodox kulintang ensemble. Using basic patterns and interlocking rhythms, a player would use the agung to complement the melody played by the kulintang.&lt;ref name=Garfias/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scholz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zonia&gt;{{cite web | last = Velasco | first = Zonia Elvas | year = 1997 | url = http://members.aol.com/TaraCelest/kulintang_instruments.html | title =  Kulintangan | work = Palabunibuniyan Gongs | publisher = Filipino Folk Arts Theatre | accessdate = 15 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns players use are normally considered freer than either the babendil or the dabakan; players could manipulate the patterns freely as long as they conform, reaffirm,&lt;ref name=Scholz/&gt; reinforce and even generate the rhythmic mode of the piece.&lt;ref name=Yoshitaka/&gt; The length of the patterns themselves may vary depending on how they fit into the melodic improvisation.&lt;ref name=Cadar2/&gt; Rapid style is useful especially during exhibition of playing skills.&lt;ref name=Benitez/&gt;

Among both the Maguindanao and the Maranao, the agung embodies all that is masculine and thus the agung is traditionally considered a masculine instrument. To be considered a good player, one must possess strength, stamina (playing extremely fast tempos with no mistakes) and endurance. Players must also exhibit improvisation skills for different patterns to be considered as having quality musicianship—lest the audience considers the patterns played repetitions and mundane.&lt;ref name=Aga/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scholz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Danny/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cadar1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yoshitaka/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cadar2/&gt;

Because of the highly skilled nature required for playing the agung, it is not uncommon to see agung players have friendly rivalries during a performance,&lt;ref name=Garfias/&gt; using tricks in an attempt to throw others off-beat.&lt;ref name=Scholz/&gt; For instance, if the p’nanggisa’s elaborations are so elusive that the p’mals has a hard time ornamenting or if the reversed happens and the p’mals ornaments to the point the p’nanggisa’s performance is engulfed, the player that cannot keep up is usually embarrassed,&lt;ref name=Cadar2/&gt; becoming the butt of jokes.&lt;ref name=Scholz/&gt; Normally agung players switch off after each piece, but during instances like this where one player cannot handle the part being played, players either remain at their gongs or switch during the performance. It is also possible for agung players to switch places with the dabakan after two pieces. Even though the players compete, they still understand they are a single entity, closely accompanying the melody,&lt;ref name=Cadar2/&gt; employ different variations without destroying the music’s basic patterns.&lt;ref name=Garfias/&gt;

===Interactions with the opposite sex===
[[Image:Agung 11.jpg|thumb|right|An agung played during a contest by a Magui Moro Master Artist using two balus.]]
There was also a secondary motive for men, especially young males, for learning the agung: the ability to interact with young, unmarried women. Both Maranao and Maguindanao cultures traditionally adhere to Islamic customs which prohibit dating or causal conversation between the opposite sexes (unless married to or related to by blood)&lt;ref name=Yoshitaka/&gt; and therefore performances such as kulintang music provided the opportunity for such a connection.&lt;ref name=Philip/&gt; Among the Maguindanao, the rhythmic modes of duyog and sinulog a kamamatuan allowed agung players to serenade the young, unmarried women on the kulintang.&lt;ref name=Scholz/&gt; Tidto, the other rhythmic mode, could also be used but players rarely use this for serenading since the kulintang player is usually an older woman.&lt;ref name=Yoshitaka/&gt;

===Contest===
The latter mode actually is reserved specifically for solo agung contest. Unlike other Southern Filipino groups who participate in group contest, the Maguindanao are unique in that they also hold solo agung contest&lt;ref name=Philip/&gt; to find out who in the community is the best papagagung (expert agung player).&lt;ref name=Danny/&gt; Tidto is prefect for such contest since the agung is often the focus of attention, the focal point during the ensemble during this mode.&lt;ref name=Scholz/&gt; Players normally perform two or more versions&lt;ref name=Yoshitaka/&gt; playing the three types of techniques discussed above.&lt;ref name=Philip/&gt;

===Signaling and the supernatural===
Other than its use in the kulintang ensemble, the agung also had other non-ensemble uses among the Maguindanao and Maranao. The agung has been used to warn others of impending danger, announcing the time of day and other important occasions. For instance, long ago the sultan would beat the agung repeatedly to announce the onset of a meeting or during the fasting month of [[Ramadhan]], the agung would ring either at three in the morning to indicate the signal to eat (sawl) or at sunset, to mark the end for fasting that day. And supposedly due to the deep, loud sound the agung produces, people believed that it possessed supernatural powers. For instance, during an earthquake, the locals of Maguindanao would strike the agung in a fast, loud rhythm called baru-baru, believing its vibrations would either lessen or even halt the jolt of an earthquake.&lt;ref name=Philip/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aga/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dria/&gt;

==Similar agung instruments==

===Kulintang ensembles===
In the [[Sulu Archipelago]], the kulintang orchestra uses not two but three low-sounding agungs, which serve as accompaniment in Tausug, Samal and Yakan ensembles. For the Tausug and Samal, the largest of the agungs with a wide turned-in rim is called the ''tunggalan'' or ''tamak '', which provides slow, regular beats, similar to the Maguindanaon pangandungan and Maranao p’nanggisa-an. The smaller pair of agungs, the ''duahan'', syncopate with the tunggalan/tamak. These are further classified: the wider-rimmed duahan is called the ''pulakan'' and the narrower one is called the ''huhugan'' or ''buahan'' by the Tausug and ''bua'' by the Samal.&lt;ref name=Yoshitaka/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maceda1&gt;Maceda, Jose.

It includes three musicians: one standing up, playing the melody, and the rest sitting. The ahong is divided by purpose, with the higher-pitched gongs (''kaantuhan'') carrying the melody, three to four lower-pitched gongs (''gandingan'') playing melodic [[ostinato]] figures, and the lowest-pitched gong (''bandil'') setting the tempo.&lt;ref name=Lydia&gt;{{cite web | last = de Leon | first = Lydia Mary | year = 2006 | url = http://litera1no4.tripod.com/manobo_frame.html | title = Manobo | work = Philippine Literature | accessdate = 15 November 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061128164911/http://litera1no4.tripod.com/manobo_frame.html| archivedate= 28 November 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Karatung 01.jpg|thumb|right|An antique bronze karatung set]]
The Tiruray call their agung ensemble a ''kelo-agung'', ''kalatong'', or ''karatung''. It is made up of five shallow bossed gongs of graduating size, each played by one person. The smallest, the ''segaron'', is used as the lead instrument, providing a steady beat.&lt;ref name=Philip/&gt;&lt;ref name=Criselda/&gt; The Manobo ''sagabong'' ensemble follows a similar format, consisting of five small gongs, each held by one musician playing a unique pattern with rubber mallets, interlocking with other parts.&lt;ref name=Lydia/&gt; The T’boli and Palawan have similar agung ensembles: the T’boli ensemble is composed of three to four agungs with two to three of them collectively called ''semagi'' which play variations, and the other agung, ''tang'', providing a steady beat. The Palawan call their ensemble, composed of four gongs, a ''basal''. It includes one to two large humped, low-sounding agungs and a pair of smaller humped, higher-pitched ''sanangs'' which produce metallic sounds.&lt;ref name=Maceda1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Juan&gt;Francisco, Juan R. "Une epopee palawan chantee par Usuj." Asian Folklore Studies Vol. 44. No. 1. (1985), pp. 132–134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hans2&gt;Brandeis, Hans. "Utom: Summoning the Spirit: Music in the T'boli Heartland." ''[[Yearbook for Traditional Music]]'', 30(1998): 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Englis&gt;Englis, Francisco. "Philippines: Musique des hautes -terres Palawan (Palawan Highland Music)." Asian Music Vol. 25. No. ½. (1993–1994), pp. 312–314.&lt;/ref&gt; The Subanon also have an agung ensemble similar to the Tiruray karatung, called a ''gagung sua''.&lt;ref name=Benitez/&gt;

Both the Bagabo and the B’laan refer to their agung ensemble as a ''tagunggo'', a set of eight metal gongs suspended on a harness, which is played by two, three, or more people. Seven of the smaller-sized gongs produce a running melody with the eighth, largest gong playing syncopation with the other gongs to produce a particular rhythm.&lt;ref name=Baes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sanchez/&gt; The Manabo also have an agung ensemble similar to the tagunggo, called a ''tagungguan''.&lt;ref name=Lydia/&gt;

The Kadazan-Dusun, located on the western coast of [[Sabah]], refer to their agung ensemble as a ''tawag'' or ''bandil'', which consists of six to seven large gongs in shoreline groups and 7–8 large gongs for those in interior valleys. In southwestern [[Sarawak]], [[Bidayuh]] agung ensembles consist of nine large gongs divided into four groups (''taway'', ''puum'', ''bandil'', and ''sanang''), while among the [[Iban people|Iban]] of Sawarak, [[Brunei]], Kalimantan, agung ensembles are smaller in comparison.
{{Portal|Percussion}}
Such ensembles can either perform alone or with one or two drums, played with the hands or wooden sticks, as accompaniment. They play either [[wikt:homophonic|homophonically]] or in an interlocking fashion with the gongs. These agung orchestras often perform at many types of social events, including agriculture rituals, weddings, victory celebrations, curing rites, rituals for the dead, entertainment for visitors, and other community rituals.&lt;ref name=Maceda1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Criselda/&gt;&lt;ref name=Matusky/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lydia/&gt;

Historically among the main lowland Philippine groups ([[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], [[Visayan]], [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]], [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]]) agung orchestras  similar to the ones found today among non-hispanised indigenous groups in the country, were among the main instrumental ensembles used up until the 17th century, as evidenced by the agung ensemble encountered by Pigafetta in Cebu in the 16th century, similar in set up (two ''sanang'', two ''agung'' and one ''gimbal'') to the basal ensemble of the Palawan people.

'''Benevolent prejudice''' is a superficially positive prejudice that is expressed in terms of positive beliefs and emotional responses, which are associated with hostile prejudices or result in keeping affected groups in inferior positions in society.

== Application ==
Benevolent prejudice is a superficially positive type of prejudice that is expressed in terms of apparently positive beliefs and emotional responses. Though this type of prejudice associates supposedly good things with certain groups, it still has the result of keeping the group members in inferior positions in society.&lt;ref name="Bernard E."&gt;{{cite book |first1=Bernard E. |last1=Whitley |first2=Mary E. |last2=Kite |year=2010 |title=The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-81128-2}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Benevolent prejudices can help justify any hostile prejudices a person has toward a particular group.&lt;ref name="journal10.1037/0022-3514.81.1.33"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.1.33 |title=Moral credentials and the expression of prejudice |year=2001 |last1=Monin |first1=Benoît |last2=Miller |first2=Dale T. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=81 |pages=33–43 |pmid=11474723 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined by [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[LGBT rights charity [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]] as "expressions of positive views about minority groups that are not intended to demonstrate less positive attitudes towards them, but which may still produce negative consequences".&lt;ref name="Understanding Prejudice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Prejudice: Attitudes towards minorities|url=http://www.stonewall.org.uk/documents/pdf_cover__content.pdf|publisher=[[Stonewall (charity)]]|accessdate=7 March 2015|format=PDF|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence also shows that there is a [[correlation]] between benevolent prejudices and [[hostile prejudice]]s towards a particular group, in particular regarding the issue of [[Women are wonderful|benevolent prejudice towards women]] and [[misogyny]].&lt;ref name="WhitleyKite2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bernard Whitley|author2=Mary Kite|title=The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXSJEjl4uZYC&amp;pg=PA225|date=12 February 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-495-81128-9|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== White Americans and African Americans ===
In an experiment run by Judd, Park, Ryan, Brauer, and Kraus ({{date|1995}}),&lt;ref name="Judd"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.3.460 |title=Stereotypes and ethnocentrism: Diverging interethnic perceptions of African American and White American youth |year=1995 |last1=Judd |first1=Charles M. |last2=Park |first2=Bernadette |last3=Ryan |first3=Carey S. |last4=Brauer |first4=Markus |last5=Kraus |first5=Susan |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=460–81 |pmid=7562391}}&lt;/ref&gt; perceptions of [[African Americans]] held by [[White Americans]] show that they held hostile beliefs indicating that they viewed African Americans as hostile, cliquish, irresponsible, and loud. However, the same White American participants held benevolent beliefs that African Americans were athletic, musical, religious, and had strong family ties. The study was also done with African American participants who were asked to share their beliefs about White Americans. The African Americans said that White Americans were self-centered, greedy, stuffy/uptight, and sheltered from the real world.  However, the same African Americans held benevolent beliefs that White Americans were intelligent, organized, independent, and financially well-off.&lt;ref name="Judd" /&gt;

===LGBT and disabled people===
A Stonewall UK publication (''Understanding Prejudice: Attitudes towards minorities'') published in {{date|2004}} has found that interviewees used benevolent stereotyping of gay men as "fun" and "caring stereotypes" of disabled individuals, saying they were "vulnerable and in need of protection". This was seen as contrasting to the negative prejudices of [[Romani people]], [[Irish Travellers]] (both categorized in the survey as "Gypsies") and [[asylum seekers]] who were often the subject of aggressive prejudice.&lt;ref name="Understanding Prejudice"/&gt; The survey also stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These stereotypes are not intended to demonstrate a less positive attitude towards these groups, but lesbians, gay men or disabled people can experience these views as negative and discriminatory. This benevolent prejudice demonstrates a lack of understanding of what being disabled or lesbian and gay can mean; a lack of awareness of the more serious discrimination that these groups often experience; and the changing expectations and rights of these minority groups. Other research has suggested that these benevolent attitudes can play an important role in the social exclusion of particular groups, for example because labels like "nice", "kind" and "helpless" can define some minority groups as not competent or suitable for powerful positions.&lt;ref name="Understanding Prejudice"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The survey also showed that men were more likely to exhibit aggressive prejudice, whereas women were more likely to exhibit benevolent prejudice.&lt;ref name="Understanding Prejudice"/&gt;

'''Best Enemies''' is an education resource and film created by Ross and Darren Bark that discusses the cyber bullying problem in Australian schools, and explores how to tackle it and help students become pro-active in reporting and stopping it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/bully-victims-urged-to-tell-tales-online-20090620-crwh.html|title=Bully victims urged to tell tales online |last=Browne|first=Rachel |date=June 21, 2009|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and services==
Best Enemies has also been used as a community-based education program that illustrates the issue of cyber bullying through a film based on a true story of a 15-year-old girl whose best friend betrayed her in a bullying campaign conducted via SMS and online messaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yapa.org.au/yapa/events/shift/workshops.php Youth Action and Policy Association NSW] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010115624/http://www.yapa.org.au/yapa/events/shift/workshops.php |date=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program targets schools and youth organisations to address the causes and consequences of the serious social problem of cyber bullying and cyber safety. The program is supported by Youth Interagency Groups, the Department of Education and Training and various agencies of the NSW Government.

The Best Enemies study guide and cybersafety resource was produced by The [[Australian Teachers of Media]] and is also distributed by The Education Shop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeducationshop.com.au/shop/product.asp?pID=3314&amp;cID=19 The Education Shop - Best Enemies Study Guide and DVD-ROM]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is supported by [[Hoyts]], [[Girlfriend Magazine]], Mentos Cube, [[Myspace]] and Point Zero Youth Services.

==Partnership with Bully Free Australia Foundation==
In March 2013, Best Enemies and The Bully Free Australia Foundation signed a partnership agreement with a vision to "protect and empower Australian children and adolescents to live a fulfilling life free from all forms of bullying".

On 16 March 2013, the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard formally opened The Bully Free Australia Foundation at Essendon Airport to a crowd of more than 400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/bill-to-stop-workplace-bullies-20130316-2g76e.html|title=Bill to stop workplace bullies |last=Schetzer|first=Alana |date=March 16, 2013|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brown Point''' (also known as Point Brown) is a [[headland]] located in the [[Australia|Australian state]] of [[South Australia]] on the west coast of [[Yorke Peninsula]] overlooking [[Hardwicke Bay]] about {{convert|12|km}} west of [[Minlaton, South Australia|Minlaton]].  Since 1999, it has been located within the gazetted locality of [[Bluff Beach, South Australia|Bluff Beach]].&lt;ref name="LMV"&gt;{{cite web |title=Search results for ‘Brown Point, PT' with the following datasets being selected - 'Suburbs and Localities', 'Government Towns', 'Counties', 'Local Government Areas', 'SA Government Regions’ and 'Gazetteer' |url= http://location.sa.gov.au/viewer/?map=roads&amp;x=137.52923&amp;y=-34.73866&amp;z=13&amp;uids=19,105&amp;pinx=137.479150&amp;piny=-34.732680&amp;pinTitle=Location&amp;pinText=Brown+Point,+Pt |website=Location SA Map Viewer|publisher=Government of South Australia|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=South Australia.

==Davits==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Brown Point with its boat winching system is unique, and is a proven [[tourist attraction]].  [[Photograph]]s of these "Davits" are exhibited nationally in tourist and travel agencies and also on souvenirs and post cards. The manual winching method for raising and lowering boats from cliff to water with the aid of stable uprights, cables and supports, was introduced by George Parsons and Fred Schwarz in the 1920s and it has proved to be a very assured and convenient way of safe guarding a craft in bad weather over the years. Today the [[fiberglass|fibreglass]] boat has replaced the clinker or wooden boat on account of easy maintenance etc. and trailers have replaced the winching system.

{{Culture of Egypt}}
{{Copts}}
'''Coptic''', or '''Coptic Egyptian''' ([[Bohairic]]: {{Coptic|ϯⲙⲉⲧⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ}} ''ti.met.rem.ən.k&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;ēmi'' and [[Sahidic]]: {{Coptic|ⲧⲙⲛ̄ⲧⲣⲙ̄ⲛ̄ⲕⲏⲙⲉ}} ''t.mənt.rəm.ən.kēme''), is the latest stage of the [[Egyptian language]], a northern [[Afro-Asiatic language]] spoken in [[Egypt]] until at least the 17th century as official language.&lt;ref&gt;Coptic Encyclopedia; http://cdm15831.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/cce/id/520&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian began to be written in the [[Coptic alphabet]], an adaptation of the [[Greek alphabet]] with the addition of six or seven signs from [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] to represent Egyptian sounds the [[Greek language]] did not have, in the 1st century AD.{{sfn|Reintges|2004}}

Several distinct Coptic dialects are identified, the most prominent of which are ''Sahidic'', originating in parts of [[Upper Egypt]], and ''Bohairic'', originally from the western [[Nile Delta]] in [[Lower Egypt]].

Coptic and Demotic are grammatically closely related to [[Late Egyptian language|Late Egyptian]], which was written with [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Coptic flourished as a [[literary language]] from the 2nd to 13th centuries, and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. It was supplanted by [[Egyptian Arabic]] as a [[spoken language]] toward the [[early modern period]], but [[language revitalization]] efforts have been underway since the 19th century.

== Name ==
The native Coptic name for the language is {{Coptic|ϯⲙⲉⲧⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ}} {{IPA|/ti-met-rem-en-kʰeː-mi/}} in the Bohairic (Delta) dialect, {{Coptic|ⲧⲙⲛ̄ⲧⲣⲙ̄ⲛ̄ⲕⲏⲙⲉ}} {{IPA|/t-ment-rem-en-kiː-me/}} in the Sahidic (Valley) dialect. The particle prefix ''me(n)t-'' from the verb {{Coptic|ⲙⲟⲩϯ}} ''mouti'' ('to speak') forms many abstract nouns in Coptic (not only those pertaining to "language"). The term ''remenkhēmi/remenkēme'' meaning 'Egyptian', literally 'person of Egypt', is a compound of ''rem-'', which is the [[construct state]] of the Coptic noun {{Coptic|ⲣⲱⲙⲓ}}/{{Coptic|ⲣⲱⲙⲉ}}, 'man, human being', + the genitive preposition ''(e)n-'' 'of' + the word for 'Egypt', {{Coptic|ⲭⲏⲙⲓ}}/{{Coptic|ⲕⲏⲙⲉ}} ''k&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;ēmi/kēme'' (cf. [[Egypt#Names|Kemet]]). Thus, the whole expression literally means 'language of the people of Egypt', or simply 'Egyptian language'.

Another name by which the language has been called is {{Coptic|ⲧⲙⲛ̄ⲧⲕⲩⲡⲧⲁⲓⲟⲛ}} ''/timentkuptaion/'' from the Copto-[[Greek language|Greek]] form {{Coptic|ⲧⲙⲛ̄ⲧⲁⲓⲅⲩⲡⲧⲓⲟⲛ}} ''/timentaiguption/'' ('Egyptian language'). The term ''logos ən aiguptios'' ('Egyptian language') is also attested in Sahidic, but ''logos'' and ''aiguptios'' are both Greek in origin. In the liturgy of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], the name is more officially {{Coptic|ϯⲁⲥⲡⲓ ⲛ̀ⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ}} ''ti aspi ən rem ən kēmi'', 'the Egyptian language', ''aspi'' being the Egyptian word for language.

== Geographic distribution ==
{{IPA notice}}
Coptic is today spoken liturgically in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] and [[Coptic Catholic Church]] (along with [[Modern Standard Arabic]]). The language is spoken only in Egypt and historically has had little influence outside of the territory, except for monasteries located in [[Nubia]]. Coptic's most noticeable linguistic impact has been on the various dialects of [[Egyptian Arabic]], which is characterized by a Coptic [[stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]] in [[lexicon|lexical]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[syntax|syntactical]], and [[phonology|phonological]] features.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

=== Influence on other languages ===
In addition to influencing the grammar, vocabulary and syntax of Egyptian Arabic, Coptic has lent to both [[Arabic]] and [[Modern Hebrew]] such words as:

* ''timsāḥ'', {{lang-ar|تمساح}}, {{lang-he|תמסח}} "crocodile"; {{Coptic|ⲉⲙⲥⲁϩ}} {{lang|cop-Latn|emsaḥ}}; this subsequently entered Turkish as {{lang|tr|timsah}}. It should be noted, however, that Coptic {{Coptic|ⲉⲙⲥⲁϩ}} is grammatically masculine and hence would have been vocalised ''pemsaḥ'' or ''bemsaḥ'' (Sahidic: {{Coptic|ⲡⲉⲙⲥⲁϩ}}; Bohairic: {{Coptic|ⲡⲓⲉⲙⲥⲁϩ}}). Hence it is unclear why the word should have entered Arabic with an initial ''t'', which would have required the word to be grammatically feminine (i.e. Sahidic: {{Coptic|*ⲧⲉⲙⲥⲁϩ}}; Bohairic: {{Coptic|*ϯⲉⲙⲥⲁϩ}}).
* ''ṭūbah'' {{lang|ar|طوبة}} "brick"; Sahidic {{Coptic|ⲧⲱⲃⲉ}} {{lang|cop-Latn|to:be}}; Bohairic {{Coptic|ⲧⲱⲃⲓ}} {{lang|cop-Latn|to:bi}}; this subsequently entered [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (via [[Andalusian Arabic]]) as {{lang|ca|tova}} and {{lang|es|[[adobe]]}} respectively, the latter of which was borrowed by [[American English]].
* ''wāḥah'' {{lang|ar|واحة}} "oasis"; Sahidic {{Coptic|ⲟⲩⲁϩⲉ}} {{lang|cop-Latn|waḥe}}, Bohairic {{Coptic|ⲟⲩⲉϩⲓ}} {{lang|cop-Latn|weḥi}}; this subsequently entered Turkish as {{lang|tr|vaha}}

A few words of Coptic origin are found in the [[Greek language]]; some of the words were later lent to various European languages — such as ''[[barge]]'', from Coptic {{Coptic|ⲃⲁⲁⲣⲉ}} {{lang|cop-Latn|bari}}, "small boat".

However, most words of Egyptian origin that entered into Greek and subsequently into other European languages came directly from Ancient Egyptian, often [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]]. An example is the Greek {{lang|grc|ὄασις}} {{lang|grc-Latn|oasis}}, which comes directly from Egyptian {{lang|egy-Latn|[[wikt:wḥꜣt|wḥꜣt]]}} or demotic {{lang|egy-Latn|[[wikt:wḥj|wḥj]]}}. However, Coptic [[reborrowing|reborrowed]] some words of Ancient Egyptian origin into its lexicon, via Greek. For example, both Sahidic and Bohairic use the word {{lang|cop-Latn|ebenos}}, which was taken directly from Greek {{lang|grc|ἔβενος}} "ebony", originally from Egyptian {{lang|egy-Latn|[[wikt:hbnj|hbnj]]}}.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Many major cities' names in modern Egypt are Arabic adaptations of their [[list of Coptic place names|former Coptic names]]: 
* [[Tanta]] – {{Coptic|ⲧⲁⲛⲧⲁⲑⲟ}} ({{lang|cop-Latn|Tantatho}})
* [[Asyut]] – {{Coptic|ⲥⲓⲟⲟⲩⲧ}} ({{lang|cop-Latn|Siowt}})
* [[Faiyum]] – {{Coptic|ⲡⲉⲓⲟⲙ}} ({{lang|cop-Latn|pIom}})
* [[Damietta|Dumyat]] – {{Coptic|ⲧⲁⲙⲓⲁϯ}} ({{lang|cop-Latn|Tamiati}})
* [[Aswan]] – {{Coptic|ⲥⲟⲩⲁⲛ}} ({{lang|cop-Latn|Suan}})
* [[Damanhur]] – {{Coptic|ϯⲙⲓⲛϩⲱⲣ}} ({{lang|cop-Latn|Timinhor}})
{{Anchor|papnoute}}The Coptic name {{Coptic|ⲡⲁⲡⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉ}}, {{lang|cop-Latn|papnoute}} (from Egyptian {{lang|egy-Latn|pꜣy-pꜣ-nṯr}}), means "belonging to God" or "he of God"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://projetrosette.info/popup.php?Id=1012&amp;idObjet=1780 |title=pAy, pA(n)y |work=Projet Rosette |access-date=2017-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://projetrosette.info/popup.php?Id=1012&amp;idObjet=2725 |title=nTr |work=Projet Rosette |access-date=2017-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/coptic-dictionary/entry.cgi?entry=1752&amp;super=719 |title=ⲗⲁϩⲙϥ [lahmf], ⲗⲁϩⲙⲉϥ [lahmef] |work=Coptic Dictionary Online |publisher=[[Georgetown University]] |access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It was adapted into Arabic as {{lang|ar-Latn|Babnouda}}, which remains a common name among Egyptian Copts to this day. It was also borrowed into Greek as the name {{lang|grc|Παφνούτιος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|[[Paphnutius (disambiguation)|Paphnutius]]}}). That, in turn, is the source of the Russian name {{lang|ru|[[:ru:Пафнутий|Пафнутий]]}} ({{lang|ru-Latn|Pafnuty}}), like the mathematician [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]].

The [[Old Nubian language]] and the modern [[Nobiin language]] borrowed many words of Coptic origin.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

== History ==
[[File:Coptic liturgic inscription.JPG|right|thumb|Fifth–sixth century Coptic liturgic inscription from [[Upper Egypt]].]]
The [[Egyptian language]] may have the longest documented history of any language, from [[Old Egyptian language|Old Egyptian]] that appeared just before 3200 BC&lt;ref name="Allen2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=James P.|authorlink=James Peter Allen|title=Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lF78Max-h8MC&amp;pg=PA2|accessdate=19 May 2014|edition=2nd|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-48635-4|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to its final phases as Coptic in the [[Middle Ages]]. Coptic belongs to the Later Egyptian phase, which started to be written in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Later Egyptian represented colloquial speech of the later periods. It had analytic features like definite and indefinite articles and [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] verb conjugation. Coptic, therefore, is a reference to both the most recent stage of Egyptian after Demotic and the new writing system that was adapted from the Greek alphabet.

=== Pre-Islamic period ===
The earliest attempts to write the Egyptian language using the Greek alphabet are Greek transcriptions of Egyptian proper names, most of which date to the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. Scholars frequently refer to this phase as pre-Coptic. However, it is clear that by the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]], demotic scribes regularly employed a more phonetic orthography, a testament to the increasing cultural contact between [[Egyptians]] and [[Greeks]] even before [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of Egypt. Coptic itself, or Old Coptic, takes root in the first century. The transition from the older Egyptian scripts to the newly adapted Coptic alphabet was in part due to the decline of the traditional role played by the priestly class of [[ancient Egyptian religion]], who unlike most ordinary Egyptians, were literate in the temple scriptoria. Old Coptic is represented mostly by non-Christian texts such as Egyptian pagan prayers and magical and astrological papyri. Many of them served as [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to original hieratic and demotic equivalents. The glosses may have been aimed at non-Egyptian speakers.
[[File:coptic luke.jpg|right|thumb|Eighth century Coptic manuscript of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 5.5–9]] Under late [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule]], [[Diocletian]] persecuted many Egyptian converts to the new [[Christianity|Christian faith]], which forced new converts to flee to the Egyptian deserts. In time, the growth of these communities generated the need to write Christian Greek instructions in the Egyptian language. The early Fathers of the Egyptian Church, such as [[Anthony the Great]], [[Pachomius the Great]], [[Macarius of Egypt]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], who otherwise usually wrote in Greek, addressed some of their works to the Egyptian monks in Egyptian. The Egyptian language, now written in the Coptic alphabet, flourished in the second and third centuries. However, it was not until [[Shenoute]] that Coptic became a fully standardized literary language based on the Sahidic dialect. Shenouda's native Egyptian tongue and knowledge of Greek and rhetoric gave him the necessary tools to elevate Coptic, in content and style, to a literary height nearly equal to the position of the Egyptian language in ancient Egypt.

=== Islamic period ===
[[File:Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar.png|thumb|Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar]]

The [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] by [[Arabs]] came with the [[spread of Islam]] in the seventh century. At the turn of the eighth century, Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] decreed that Arabic replace [[Koine Greek]] and Coptic as the sole administrative language. Literary Coptic gradually declined, and within a few hundred years, Egyptian bishop [[Severus Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ]] found it necessary to write his ''History of the Patriarchs'' in Arabic. However, ecclesiastically the language retained an important position, and many [[hagiography|hagiographic]] texts were also composed during this period. Until the 10th century, Coptic remained the spoken language of the native population outside the capital.

Persecutions under the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] (1250–1517) led to the further decline of Coptic{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} until it completely gave way to Egyptian Arabic around the 17th century{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}, though it may have survived in isolated pockets for a little longer. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Pope Cyril IV of Alexandria]] started a national Church-sponsored movement to revive Coptic. Several works of grammar were published, withal a more comprehensive dictionary than had been formerly available. The scholarly findings of the field of [[Egyptology]] and the inauguration of the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]] further contributed to the renaissance. Efforts at language revitalization continue to be undertaken, both inside and [[Liberal Egyptian Party|outside the Church]], and have attracted the interest of [[Copts]] and linguists in and outside of Egypt.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== Writing system ==
{{main article|Coptic alphabet}}
[[File:Coptic.jpg|thumb|Stone with Coptic inscription]]

Coptic uses a writing system almost wholly derived from the [[Greek alphabet]], with the addition of a number of letters that have their origins in [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]]. (That makes it comparable to the Latin-based [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic alphabet]], which includes the runic letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]].)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.suscopts.org/deacons/coptic/coptic_alphabet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There is some variation in the number and forms of these signs depending on the dialect. Some of the letters in the Coptic alphabet that are of Greek origin were normally reserved for words that are themselves Greek. Old Coptic texts employed several graphemes that were not retained in the literary Coptic orthography of later centuries.

In Sahidic, [[syllable]] boundary may have been marked by a supralinear stroke, or the stroke may have tied letters together in one word, since Coptic texts did not otherwise indicate word divisions. Some scribal traditions use a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] over {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} at the beginning of a syllable or to mark a diphthong. Bohairic uses a superposed point or small stroke known as a ''djinkim''.

== Literature ==
{{Main article|Coptic literature}}
The oldest Coptic writings date to the pre-Christian era (Old Coptic), though Coptic literature consists mostly of texts written by prominent saints of the Coptic Church such as Anthony the Great, Pachomius the Great and Shenoute. Shenoute helped fully standardize the Coptic language through his many sermons, treatises and homilies, which formed the basis of early Coptic literature.

== Vocabulary ==
The core [[lexicon]] of Coptic is [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], most closely related to the preceding [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] phase of the language. Up to 40% of the vocabulary of literary Coptic is drawn from [[Greek language|Greek]], but borrowings are not always fully adapted to the Coptic phonological system and may have [[Semantics|semantic]] differences as well. There are instances of Coptic texts having passages that are almost entirely composed from Greek lexical roots. However, that is likely due to the fact that the majority of Coptic religious texts are direct translations of Greek works.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
‘What invariably attracts the attention of the reader of a Coptic text, especially if it is written in the Sa'idic dialect, is the very liberal use which is made of Greek loan words, of which so few, indeed, are to be found in the Ancient Egyptian language. There Greek loan words occur everywhere in Coptic literature, be it Biblical, liturgical, theological, or non-literary, i.e. legal documents and personal letters. Though nouns and verbs predominate, the Greek loan words may come from any other part of speech except pronouns.’&lt;ref&gt;Girgis, WA (1963–64). Greek loan words in Coptic. ''Bulletin de la Société d’archéologie copte'' 17:63–73.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Words or concepts for which no adequate Egyptian translation existed were taken directly from Greek to avoid altering the meaning of the religious message. In addition, other Egyptian words that would have adequately translated the Greek equivalents were not employed as they were perceived as having overt pagan associations. Old Coptic texts employ many such words, phrases and epithets; for example, the word {{Coptic|ⲧⲃⲁⲓⲧⲱⲩ}} '(Who is) in (His) Mountain', is an epithet of [[Anubis]].&lt;ref&gt;Gignac, Francis Thomas, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; There are also traces of some archaic grammatical features, such as residues of the Demotic [[relative clause]], lack of an indefinite article and possessive use of suffixes.

Thus, the transition from the 'old' traditions to the new Christian religion also contributed to the adoption of Greek words into the Coptic religious lexicon. It is safe to assume that the everyday speech of the native population retained, to a greater extent, its indigenous Egyptian character, which is sometimes reflected in Coptic nonreligious documents such as letters and contracts.

== Phonology ==
Coptic provides the clearest indication of Later Egyptian [[phonology]] from its writing system, which fully indicates vowel sounds and occasionally stress pattern. The phonological system of Later Egyptian is also better known than that of the Classical phase of the language because of a greater number of sources indicating Egyptian sounds, including [[Amarna letters|cuneiform letters]] containing transcriptions of Egyptian words and phrases, and Egyptian renderings of [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] names. Coptic sounds, in addition, are known from a variety of Coptic-Arabic papyri in which Arabic letters were used to transcribe Coptic and vice versa. They date to the medieval Islamic period, when Coptic was still spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Sijpesteijn | first= Petra |author2=Lennart Sundelin | title=Papyrology and the History of Early Islamic Egypt | publisher=Brill Academic Publishers | year=2004 | location=Leiden, Boston | isbn=978-90-04-13886-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowels ===
There are some differences of opinion among Coptic language scholars on the correct phonetic interpretation of the writing system of Coptic. Differences centre on how to interpret the pairs of letters ε/η and ο/ω. In Greek spelling, the first member of each pair is a short closed vowel {{IPA|/e, o/}}, and the second member is a long open vowel {{IPA|/ɛː, ɔː/}}. In some interpretations of Coptic phonology,{{sfn|Plumley|1948}} it is assumed that the length difference is primary, with ε/η {{IPA|e/eː}} and ο/ω is {{IPA|o/oː}}. Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg 1962/1990&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|pp=xii-ix}} argue for a different analysis in which ε/η and ο/ω are interpreted as {{IPA|e/ɛ}} and {{IPA|o/ɔ}}.

These two charts show the two theories of Coptic vowel phonology:

Dialects vary in their realization. The difference between [o] and [u] seems to be allophonic. Evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that these are distinct vowels, and if they are, the difference has a very low [[functional load]]. For dialects that use orthographic &lt;ει&gt; for a single vowel, there appears to be no phonetic difference from &lt;ι&gt;.

Double orthographic vowels are presumed here to be long, as that makes the morphology more straightforward. (Another common interpretation is that these represented glottal stop.) 

Akhmimic is conservative, close to what is reconstructed for Old Coptic.

There is no length distinction in final stressed position, but only those vowels that occur long appear there: &lt;(ε)ι, ε, α, ο~ω, ου&gt;.

In Sahidic, the letter ''ε'' was used for short {{IPA|/e/}} before back fricatives, and also for unstressed schwa. It's possible there was also a distinction between short {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}, but if so the functional load was extremely low.

|}

Again, length is neutralized in final stressed position: &lt;(ε)ι, η, ε, α, ο, ω~ου&gt;.

Bohairic did not have long vowels. {{IPA|/i/}} was only written &lt;ι&gt;. As above, it's possible that /u/ and /o/ were distinct vowels rather than just allophones.

| colspan=2| {{IPA|a}} &lt;α&gt;

In Late Coptic (that is, Late Bohairic), the vowels were reduced to those found in Egyptian Arabic, {{IPA|/a, i, u/}}. &lt;ω, ο&gt; became /u/, &lt;ε&gt; became /a/, and &lt;η&gt; became either /i/ or /a/. It's difficult to explain &lt;η&gt;. However, it generally became /a/ in stressed monosyllables, /i/ in unstressed monosyllables, and in polysyllables, /a/ when followed by /i/, and /i/ when not. 

There were no doubled orthographic vowels in Mesokemic. Some representative correspondences with Sahidic are,

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
!Sahidic stressed vowels
|α||αα, εε||η||ο||ω||ωω
|-
!Mesokemic equivalent
|ε||η||η||α||ο||ω
|}

It's not clear if these correspondences reflect distinct pronunciations in Mesokemic, or if they're an imitation of the long Greek vowels &lt;η, ω&gt;.

=== Consonants ===
As with the vowels, there are differences of opinion over the correct interpretation of the Coptic consonant letters, particular the letters ϫ and Ϭ. ϫ is transcribed as {{angle bracket|j}} in many older Coptic sources and Ϭ as {{angle bracket|ɡ}}{{sfn|Plumley|1948}} or {{angle bracket|č}}. {{harvtxt|Lambdin|1983}} notes that the current conventional pronunciations are different from the probable ancient pronunciations: Sahidic ϫ was probably pronounced {{IPA|[tʲ]}} and Ϭ was probably pronounced {{IPA|[kʲ]}}. {{harvtxt|Reintges|2004|p=22}} suggests that ϫ was pronounced {{IPA|[tʃ]}}.

The following chart shows the consonants that are represented in Sahidic Coptic orthography. Consonants that are rare or found primarily in Greek loanwords are shown in parentheses:

Beside being found in Greek loanwords, the letters {{angle bracket|φ, θ, χ}} were used in native words for a sequence of {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} plus {{IPA|/h/}}, as in ⲑⲉ = ⲧ-ϩⲉ "the-way" (f.sg.) and ⲫⲟϥ = ⲡ-ϩⲟϥ "the-snake" (m.sg). The letters did not have this use in Bohairic, which used them for single sounds. 

It is possible that in addition there was a glottal stop, {{IPAlink|ʔ}}, that was not consistently written. Coptic does not seem to have had a glottal stop at the beginning of orthographically vowel-initial words. It's possible that vowels written double were an attempt to indicate glottal stop, rather than a long vowel, in the middle of a word. However, there is little evidence for this (e.g., Arabic loans with short vowels and glottal stop are not written with double vowels in Coptic, and Coptic words with double orthographic vowels are transcribed with long vowels rather than hamza in Arabic.)

In Late Coptic (ca. 14th century), Bohairic sounds that did not occur in Egyptian Arabic were lost. A possible shift from a tenuis-aspirate distinction to voiced-tenuis is only attested from the alveolars, the only place that Arabic has such a contrast.

Earlier phases of Egyptian may have contrasted voiceless and voiced bilabial plosives, but the distinction seems to have been lost. Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic all interchangeably use their respective graphemes to indicate either sound; for example, Coptic for 'iron' appears alternately as {{Coptic|ⲡⲉⲛⲓⲡⲉ}}, {{Coptic|ⲃⲉⲛⲓⲡⲉ}} and {{Coptic|ⲃⲓⲛⲓⲃⲉ}}. That probably reflects dialect variation. Both letters were interchanged with {{Coptic|ⲫ}} and {{Coptic|ϥ}} to indicate {{IPA|/f/}}, and {{Coptic|ⲃ}} was also used in many texts to indicate the bilabial approximant {{IPA|/w/}}. [[Coptology|Coptologists]] believe that Coptic {{Coptic|ⲃ}} was articulated as a [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[β]}}. In the present-day Coptic Church services, this letter is realized as {{IPA|/v/}}, but it is almost certainly a result of the [[Coptic pronunciation reform|pronunciation reforms]] instituted in the 19th century.

Whereas Old Egyptian contrasts {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, the two sounds appear to be in [[free variation]] in Coptic, as they were since the Middle Egyptian period. However, they are contrasted only in Greek loans; for example, native Coptic {{Coptic|ⲁⲛⲍⲏⲃⲉ}} (''anzībə'') and {{Coptic|ⲁⲛⲥⲏⲃⲉ}} (''ansībə'') 'school' are homophonous. Other consonants that sometimes appear to be either in free variation or to have different distributions across dialects are {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[r]}} and {{IPA|[l]}} (especially in the Fayyumic dialect, a feature of earlier Egyptian) and {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ]}}, with the voiceless [[stop consonant]]s being more common in Coptic words and the voiced ones in Greek borrowings. Apart from the [[liquid consonant]]s, this pattern may indicate a [[sound change]] in Later Egyptian, leading to a neutralization of voiced alveolar and velar plosives. When the voiced plosives are realized, it is usually the result of [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|consonant voicing]] in proximity to {{IPA|/n/}}.

Though there is no clear evidence that Coptic had a [[glottal stop]], different orthographic means have been posited for indicating one by those who believe that it did: with {{Coptic|ⲁ}} word-initially, with {{Coptic|ⲓ}} word-finally in monosyllabic words in northern dialects and {{Coptic|ⲉ}} in monosyllabic words in Akhmimic and Assiutic, by reduplication of a vowel's grapheme but mostly unwritten.

A few early manuscripts have a letter {{coptic|ⳋ}} or {{coptic|ⳃ}} ''ç'' where Sahidic and Bohairic have {{coptic|ϣ}} ''š''. and Akhmimic has {{coptic|ⳉ}} ''x''. This sound seems to have been lost early on.

== Grammar ==
Coptic is [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] with [[subject–verb–object]] word order but can be [[verb–subject–object]] with the correct preposition in front of the subject. Number, gender, tense, and mood are indicated by prefixes that come from Late Egyptian. The earlier phases of Egyptian did this through suffixation. Some vestiges of the suffix inflection survive in Coptic, mainly to indicate [[inalienable possession]] and in some verbs. Compare the Middle Egyptian form ''*satāpafa'' 'he chooses' (written ''stp.f'' in hieroglyphs) to Coptic (Sahidic) ''f.sotp'' {{Coptic|ϥⲥⲱⲧⲡ̅}} 'he chooses'.

=== Nouns ===
All Coptic nouns carry [[grammatical gender]], either masculine or feminine, usually marked through a prefixed definite article as in the [[Romance languages]]. Masculine nouns are marked with the article {{IPA|/pə, peː/}} and feminine nouns with the article {{IPA|/tə, teː/}}{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|p=2}} in the Sahidic dialect and {{IPA|/pi, əp/}} and {{IPA|/ti, ət/}} in the Bohairic dialect.

Bohairic: {{Coptic|ⲡⲓⲣⲱⲙⲓ}} {{IPA|/pi-roːmi/}} - 'the man' / {{Coptic|ϯϫⲓϫ}} {{IPA|/ti-dʒiɡ/}} - 'the hand'

Sahidic: {{Coptic|ⲡⲉⲣⲱⲙⲉ}} {{IPA|/pə-roːme/}} - 'the man' / {{Coptic|ⲧⲉϫⲓϫ}} {{IPA|/tə-ciɟ/}} - 'the hand'

The definite and indefinite articles also indicate [[Grammatical number|number]]; however, only definite articles mark gender. Coptic has a number of [[broken plural]]s, a vestige of Older Egyptian, but in the majority of cases, the article marks number. Generally, nouns [[inflection|inflected]] for plurality end in {{IPA|/wə/}}, but there are some irregularities. The dual was another feature of earlier Egyptian that survives in Coptic in only few words, such as {{Coptic|ⲥⲛⲁⲩ}} (''snau'') 'two'.

Words of Greek origin keep their original grammatical gender, except for neuter nouns, which become masculine in Coptic.

==== Pronouns ====
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Coptic pronouns are of two kinds, dependent and independent. Independent pronouns are used when the pronoun is acting as the subject of a sentence, as the object of a verb, or with a preposition. Dependent pronouns are a series of prefixes and suffixes that can attach to verbs and other nouns. Coptic verbs can therefore be said to inflect for the person, number and gender of the subject and the object: a pronominal prefix marks the subject, and a pronominal suffix marks the object, e.g. "I I'have'it the ball." When (as in this case) the subject is a pronoun, it normally isn't also expressed independently, unless for emphasis.

As in other Afroasiatic languages, gender of pronouns differ only in the second and third person singular. The following table shows the pronouns of the Sahidian dialect:

=== Adjectives ===
Most Coptic adjectives are actually nouns that have the attributive particle ''n'' to make them adjectival. In all stages of Egyptian, this morpheme is also used to express the [[Genitive case|genitive]]; for example, the Bohairic word for 'Egyptian', {{Coptic|ⲣⲉⲙ̀ⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ}} {{IPA|/remenkʰeːmi/}}, is a combination of the nominal prefix ''rem-'' (the reduced form of {{Coptic|ⲣⲱⲙⲓ}} ''rōmi'' 'man'), followed by the genitive morpheme ''ən'' ('of') and finally the word for Egypt, ''khēmi''.

=== Verbs ===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

====Verbal grade system ====
Coptic, like Ancient Egyptian and Semitic languages, has root-and-pattern or templatic morphology, and the basic meaning of a verb is contained in a root and various derived forms of root are obtained by varying the vowel pattern. For example, the root for 'build' is ''kt''.  It has four derived forms: {{IPA|kɔt}} (the absolute state grade); ket- (the nominal state grade), kot= (the pronominal state grade), and {{IPA|kɛt}} (the stative grade).
(The nominal state grade is also called the construct state in some grammars of Coptic.)

The absolute, nominal, and pronominal state grades are used in different syntactic contexts. The absolute state grade of a transitive verb is used before a direct object with the accusative preposition {{IPA|/ən, əm/}}, and the nominal state grade is used before a direct object with no case-marking.  The pronominal state grade is used before a pronominal direct object enclitic. In addition, many verbs also have a neutral state grade, used to express a state resulting from the action of the verb. Compare the following forms:{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|p=39}}

'''Absolute state grade'''
:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=ABS:absolute state grade
|{{Coptic|ⲁⲓϫⲓⲙⲓ}} {{Coptic|ⲙ̀ⲡⲁⲓⲱⲧ}}

|PFV-1SG-find.NOM DEF:MASC:SG-1SG-father
|'I found my father.'}}

'''Pronominal state grade'''
:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=PRONOM:pronominal state grade
|{{Coptic|ⲁⲓⲭⲛ̀ⲧϥ}}
|a-i-kʲənt{{=}}f
|PFV-1SG-find.PRONOM{{=}}3MSG
|'I found him.'}}

For most transitive verbs, both absolute and nominal state grade verbs are available for non-pronominal objects. However, there is one important restriction, known as ''Jernstedt's rule'' (or the ''Stern-Jernstedt rule'') (Jernstedt 1927): present-tense sentences cannot be used in the nominal state grade. Thus sentences in the present tense always show a pattern like the first example above (absolute state), never the second pattern (nominal state).

In general, the four grades of Coptic verb are not predictable from the root, and are listed in the lexicon for each verb. The following chart shows some typical patterns of correspondence:

It is hazardous to make firm generalizations about the relationships between these grade forms, but the nominal state is usually shorter than the corresponding absolute and neutral forms. Absolute and neutral state forms are usually bisyllabic or contain a long vowel; the corresponding nominal state forms are monosyllabic or have short vowels.

==== Tense/aspect/mood inflection ====
Coptic has a very large number of distinct tense/aspect/mood categories, expressed by particles which are either before the verb or before the subject. The future I {{IPA|/na/}} is a preverbal particle and follows the subject:{{sfn|Reintges|2010|p=210}}

:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes
|Ⲡⲉϫⲟⲉⲓⲥ 	ⲛⲁⲕⲣⲓⲛⲉ 	ⲛ̀ⲛⲉⲗⲁⲟⲥ
|Pə-tʲoeis 	'''na'''-krine 	ən-nə-Laos
|DEF:MASC:SG-lord FUT-judge PREP-DEF:PL-people
|'The lord will judge the nations.'}}

In contrast, the perfective {{IPA|/a/}} is a pre-subject particle:
:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=ABS:absolute state grade
|Ⲁ 	ⲧⲉϥⲥⲱⲛⲉ 	ⲇⲉ 	ⲟⲗ 	ⲛ̀ⲛⲉϥⲕⲏⲥ
|'''A''' 	te-f-soːne 	de 	ol 	ən-ne-f-keːs
|PFV DEF:F:SG-3MSG-sister part carry.ABS PREP-DEF:PL-3MSG-bone
|'His sister carried his bones.'}}

There is some variation in the labels for the tense/aspect/mood categories. The chart below shows the labels from {{harvtxt|Reintges|2004}}, {{harvtxt|Lambdin|1983}}, {{harvtxt|Plumley|1948}}. (Where they agree, only one label is shown.) Each form lists the morphology found with a nonpronominal subject and a third person singular masculine pronominal subject('he'):

==== Second tenses ====
An unusual feature of Coptic is the extensive use of a set of "second tenses", which are required in certain syntactic contexts.  "Second tenses" are also called "relative tenses" in some work.{{sfn|Reintges|2004}}

=== Prepositions ===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Coptic has prepositions, rather than postpositions:
:{{interlinear|ipa1=yes
|hi p-tʲoi
|on DEF:M:SG-ship
|'on the ship'}}

Pronominal objects of prepositions are indicated with enclitic pronouns:
:ero=k 'to you (m.sg)'
:na=n 'for us'

Many prepositions have different forms before the enclitic pronouns.{{sfn|Lambdin|2003|pp=30–31}}  Compare
:e p-{{IPA|tʲoi}}  'to the ship'
:ero=f    'to him'

=== Syntax ===

== Sentential syntax ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Coptic typically shows subject–verb–object (SVO) word order, as in the following examples:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reintges|2010|p=211}}; {{harvnb|Lambdin|1983|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=ABS:absolute state grade
|Ⲁ ⲧⲉϭⲁⲙⲁⲩⲗⲉ ⲙⲓⲥⲉ ⲛ̀ⲟⲩϣⲏⲣⲉ ⲛ̀ϣⲓⲙⲉ
|A tə-kʲamaule mise ən-u-ʃeːre ən-shime
|PFV DEF:F:SG-camel deliver.ABS PREP-INDEF:SG-girl link-woman
|'The she-camel delivered a daughter.'}}

:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes
|Ⲡⲉϫⲟⲉⲓⲥ ⲛⲁⲕⲣⲓⲛⲉ ⲛ̀ⲛⲉⲗⲁⲟⲥ
|Pə-tʲoeis na-krine ən-nə-Laos
|DEF:M:SG-lord FUT-judge PREP-DEF:PL-people
|'The Lord will judge the people.'}}

:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=ABS:absolute state grade
|Ⲁⲓϭⲓⲛⲉ ⲙ̀ⲡⲁⲉⲓⲱⲧ
|A-i-kʲine əm-p-a-eioːt
|PFV-1sg-find.ABS PREP-DEF:MASC:SG-1SG-father
|'I found my father.'}}

The verbs in these sentences are in the ''absolute state grade'',{{sfn|Reintges|2010|p=208}} which requires that its direct object be introduced with the preposition {{IPA|/ən, əm/}}.  This preposition functions like [[accusative case]].

There is also an alternative ''nominal state grade'' of the verb in which the direct object of the verb follows with no preposition:
:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=NOM:nominal state grade
|Ⲁⲓϭⲓⲛⲉ ⲡⲁⲉⲓⲱⲧ
|a-i-kʲən p-a-eioːt
|PFV-1SG-find.NOM DEF:M:SG-1SG-father
|'I found my father.'}}

== Dialects ==

[[File:Coptic and Arabic inscriptions in an Old Cairo church.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coptic and Arabic inscriptions in an Old Cairo church]]
There is little written evidence of [[dialect]]al differences in the pre-Coptic phases of the Egyptian language due to the centralized nature of the political and cultural institutions of [[ancient Egypt]]ian society. However, literary Old and Middle (Classical) Egyptian represent the spoken dialect of Lower Egypt around the city of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the capital of Egypt in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. Later Egyptian is more representative of the dialects spoken in Upper Egypt, especially around the area of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as it became the cultural and religious center of the New Kingdom.

Coptic more obviously displays a number of regional dialects that were in use from the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in northern Egypt, south into [[Nubia]], and in the western oases. However, while many of these dialects reflect actual regional linguistic (namely [[phonology|phonological]] and some lexical) variation, they mostly reflect localized [[Orthography|orthographic]] traditions with very little [[syntax|grammatical]] differences.

=== Upper Egypt ===

==== Sahidic ====
[[File:Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century CE. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century AD. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]
'''Sahidic''' (also known as '''Thebaic''') is the dialect in which most known Coptic texts are written, and was the leading dialect in the pre-[[Islam]]ic period. It is thought to have originally been a regional dialect from the area around [[Hermopolis]] (Coptic {{Coptic|Ϣⲙⲟⲩⲛⲉⲓⲛ}} ''Shmounein''). Around 300 it began to be written in literary form, including translations of major portions of the [[Bible]] (see [[Coptic versions of the Bible]]). By the 6th century, a standardized spelling had been attained throughout Egypt. Almost all native authors wrote in this dialect of Coptic. Sahidic was, beginning in the 9th century, challenged by Bohairic, but is attested as late as the 14th.

While texts in other Coptic dialects are primarily translations of Greek literary and religious texts, Sahidic is the only dialect with a considerable body of original literature and non-literary texts. Because Sahidic shares most of its features with other dialects of Coptic with few peculiarities specific to itself, and has an extensive corpus of known texts, it is generally the dialect studied by learners of Coptic, particularly by scholars outside of the Coptic Church.

==== Akhmimic ====
'''Akhmimic''' was the dialect of the area around the town of [[Akhmim]] (Greek ''Panopolis''). It flourished during the fourth and fifth centuries, after which no writings are attested. Akhmimic is phonologically the most archaic of the Coptic dialects. One characteristic feature is the retention of the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/x/}}, which is realized as {{IPA|/ʃ/}} in most other dialects. Similarly, it uses an exceptionally conservative writing system strikingly similar to Old Coptic.

==== Lycopolitan ====
'''Lycopolitan''' (also known as '''Subakhmimic''' and '''Assiutic''') is a dialect closely related to Akhmimic in terms of when and where it was attested, but manuscripts written in Lycopolitan tend to be from the area of [[Asyut]]. The main differences between the two dialects seem to be graphic in nature. The Lycopolitan variety was used extensively for translations of [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] and [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] works, including the texts of the [[Nag Hammadi library]].

=== Lower Egypt ===

==== Bohairic ====
The '''Bohairic''' (also known as '''Memphitic''') dialect originated in the western [[Nile Delta]]. The earliest Bohairic manuscripts date to the 4th century, but most texts come from the 9th century and later; this may be due to poor preservation conditions for texts in the humid regions of northern Egypt. It shows several conservative features in [[lexicon]] and [[phonology]] not found in other dialects. Bohairic is the dialect used today as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church, replacing Sahidic some time in the eleventh century. In contemporary liturgical use, there are two traditions of pronunciation, arising from successive reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries (see [[Coptic pronunciation reform]]). Modern revitalization efforts are based on this dialect.

==== Fayyumic ====
'''Fayyumic''' (also written as '''Faiyumic'''; in older works it is often called '''Bashmuric''') was spoken primarily in the [[Faiyum]] west of the Nile Valley. It is attested from the 3rd to the 10th centuries. It is most notable for writing {{coptic|ⲗ}} (which corresponds to {{IPA|/l/}}), where other dialects generally use {{coptic|ⲣ}} {{IPA|/r/}} (probably corresponding to a [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}}). In earlier stages of Egyptian, the [[Liquid consonant|liquids]] were not distinguished in writing until the New Kingdom, when Late Egyptian became the administrative language. Late Egyptian orthography utilized a [[grapheme]] that combined the graphemes for {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} in order to express {{IPA|/l/}}. Demotic for its part indicated {{IPA|/l/}} using a diacritic variety of {{IPA|/r/}}.

==== Oxyrhynchite ====
'''Oxyrhynchite''' (also known as '''Mesokemic''' or [confusingly] '''Middle Egyptian''') is the dialect of [[Oxyrhynchus]] and surrounding areas. It shows similarities with Fayyumic and is attested in manuscripts from the fourth and fifth centuries.

'''Cultural globalization''' refers to the transmission of ideas,
meanings, and [[values]] around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify [[social relation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Paul|title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|url=https://www.academia.edu/1642214}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is marked by the common consumption of [[culture]]s that have been diffused by the [[Internet]], [[popular culture]] media, and [[international travel]]. This has added to processes of [[commodities exchange|commodity exchange]] and [[colonization]] which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural [[globalization]] involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger and Paul James, ‘Ideologies of Globalism’, in Paul James and Manfred B. Steger, eds, Globalization and Culture: Vol. 4, Ideologies of Globalism, Sage Publications, London, 2010. download pdf https://uws.academia.edu/PaulJames {{Cite book|last1=Inda |first1=Jonathan |last2=Rosaldo |first2=Renato |title=The Anthropology of Globalization |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2002 |chapter=Introduction: A World in Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basics of Cultural Globalization ==

=== Overview ===

* Diffusion of ideas and cultures amongst all of the civilizations of the world.
* Trend that will eventually make all of human experience and customs the same since all cultures are coming together into one
* Occurs in everyday life, through wireless communication, electronic commerce, popular culture and international trade
* Attempt to promote a Western lifestyle and possibly Americanize the world.

=== Contributing Factors ===

* New technology and forms of communication around the world help to integrate different cultures into each other 
* Transportation technologies and services along with mass migration and individual travel contribute to this form of globalization allowing for cross-cultural exchanges
* Infrastructures and institutionalization embedded change (e.g. teaching languages such as English across the world through educational systems and training of teachers)

=== Benefits ===

* Allows for profits to companies and nations
* Offers opportunities for development and advancement in economics, technology, and information and usually impacts developed countries
* Creates a more homogeneous world
* Generates interdependent companies amongst companies

== Phases of Cultural Globalization    ==

=== Pre-modern Phase of Globalization (early civilizations to 1500) ===

* Early human migration (facilitation of trade and creation of social networks amongst other nations)
* Emergence of world religions
* Development of trans-regional trade networks (long distance trade, many centered in China and India. Early forms of globalization, especially with the Silk Route which linked the Roman Empire and the Chinese Han Empire

=== Modern Phase of Globalization ===

* European imperialism (rise of the West. European expansionism, especially with Columbus’ encounter with the New World which allowed goods and people to cross the Atlantic)
* Emerging international economy
* International migration and developments outside of the West
* Spread of modernity
* Rise of nation-state (a development of freedom of movement and cultural diffusion. 
* Industrialization (demand for raw materials to supply industries. Science grew immensely with electronic shipping, railways, and new forms of communication, such as cable technology

=== Contemporary Phase of Globalization (1945- Present) ===

* Struggle after cold war led to a slow but steady increase in cultural flows with the immigration of peoples, ideas, goods, symbols and images. 
* Represented global cultural interconnectedness, which eventually led to developments in transport and transport infrastructures such as jet airlines, construction of road and rail networks. This allowed for more tourism and shifting patterns of global migration.
* Marshall McLuhan introduced the term “global village” in the 1960s stating that it was the ability to connect and trade ideas instantly amongst the nations of the world
* The term “globalization” became popular in the 1980s

== Examples of Cultural Globalization ==

Cultural globalization integrates scholars from several disciplines, such as anthropology, sociology, communication, cultural studies, geography, political science and international relations. The field is notably broad as there are several concepts which may be perceived as cultural or transnational.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Crane, D. (2011) Cultural globalization: 2001–10, University of Pennsylvania. Available from: sociopedia.isa [6 November 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;

A visible aspect of the cultural globalization is the diffusion of certain cuisines such as American [[fast food chain]]s. The two most successful global food and beverage outlets, [[McDonald's]] and [[Starbucks]], are American companies often cited as examples of globalization, with over 36,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000006390816000103/mcd-12312015x10k.htm|title=2015 Form 10-K, McDonald's Corporation|publisher=United States Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 24,000 locations operating worldwide respectively as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Steger, Manfred.''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ExsTX8z4j8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=globalization&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Globalization]''. New York: Sterling Publishing, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Big Mac Index]] is an informal measure of purchasing power parity among world currencies.

Cultural globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature, with the two other being [[economic globalization]] and [[political globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA146|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike economic and political globalization, cultural globalization has not been the subject of extensive research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Measurement==

There have been numerous attempts to measure globalization, typically using indices that capture quantitative data for [[trade flows]], [[political integration]], and other measures.  The two most prominent are the AT Kearney/Foreign Policy Globalization index and the KOF Globalization Index.  Cultural globalization, however, is much more difficult to capture using quantitative data, because it is difficult to find easily verifiable data of the flow of ideas, opinions, and [[fashion]]s.  One attempt to do so was the Cultural Globalization Index, proposed by Randolph Kluver and Wayne Fu in 2004, and initially published by Foreign Policy Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Kluver, R., &amp; Fu, W. (2004). The cultural globalization index. In Foreign Policy Magazine. Available online: https://foreignpolicy.com/2004/02/10/the-cultural-globalization-index/&lt;/ref&gt;  This effort measured cultural flow by using global trade in media products (books, periodicals, and newspapers) as a proxy for cultural flow.  Kluver and Fu followed up with an extended analysis, using this method to measure cultural globalization in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Kluver, R., &amp; Fu, W. (2008). Measuring cultural globalization in Southeast Asia. In T. Chong (Ed.), Globalisation and its counter-forces in Southeast Asia. Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. [https://www.academia.edu/download/31540811/measuring_cult_globalization_in_SE_Asia.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts of Cultural Globalization ==
The patterns of cultural globalization is a way of spreading theories and ideas from one place to another. Although globalization has affected us economically and politically, it has also affected us socially on a wider scale. With the inequalities issues, such as race, ethnic and class systems, social inequalities plays a part within those categories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sahay|first=Vijoy|date=2013|title=Globalization, Urbanization and Migration:Anthropological Dimensions of Trends and Impacts|url=|journal=Oriental Anthropologists|volume=13|pages=305–312|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The past half-century has witnessed a trend towards globalization. Within the media and pop culture, it has shaped individuals to have certain attitudes that involve race issues thus leading to stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Technology is an impact that created a bridge that diffused the globalization of culture. It brings together [[globalization]], [[urbanization]] and [[Human migration|migration]] and how it has affected today's trends. Before urban centers had developed, the idea of globalization after the second world war was that globalization took place due to the lifting of state restrictions by different nations. There were national boundaries for the flow of goods and services, concepts and ideas.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Perspectives==

===Hybridization===

Many writers suggest that cultural globalization is a long-term historical process of bringing different cultures into interrelation. Jan Pieterse suggested that cultural globalization involves human integration and hybridization, arguing that it is possible to detect cultural mixing across continents and regions going back many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Jan N. |last=Pieterse |title=Globalization and Culture |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; They refer, for example, to the movement of religious practices, language and culture brought by [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. The Indian experience, to take another example, reveals both the pluralization of the impact of cultural globalization and its long-term history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ghosh |first=Biswajit |year=2011 |title=Cultural changes in the era of globalisation |journal=Journal of Developing Societies |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=153–175 |doi=10.1177/0169796x1102700203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of such cultural historians qualifies the lineage of writers—predominantly economists and sociologists—who trace the origins of globalization to recent [[capitalism]], facilitated through technological advances.

===Homogenization===

An alternative perspective on cultural globalization emphasizes the transfiguration of worldwide diversity into a pandemic of Westernized [[consumer culture]].&lt;ref name="Kraidy"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kraidy |first=Marwan |title=Hybridity, or the Cultural Logic of Globalization |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=Temple University Press |year=2005 |pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics argue that the dominance of American culture influencing the entire world will ultimately result in the end of [[cultural diversity]]. Such cultural globalization may lead to a human monoculture.&lt;ref name="Jaffe"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaffe|first1=Eugene D.|title=Globalization and Development|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438123318|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b5EnlzZSK4QC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=Monoculture+globalization#v=onepage&amp;q=Monoculture%20globalization&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 September 2016|language=en|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jansson|first1=Bruce S.|title=Becoming an Effective Policy Advocate|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495812395|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OmkE7Zs91uMC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=Monoculture+globalization#v=onepage&amp;q=Monoculture%20globalization&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 September 2016|language=en|date=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, understood as [[cultural imperialism]],&lt;ref&gt;John Tomlinson (1999). Globalization and Culture. Chicago University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2016}} is associated with the destruction of cultural identities, dominated by a homogenized and westernized, consumer culture. The global influence of American products, businesses and culture in other countries around the world has been referred to as [[Americanization]]. This influence is represented through that of American-based television programs which are rebroadcast throughout the world. Major American companies such as [[McDonald's]] and [[Coca-Cola]] have played a major role in the spread of American culture around the globe. Terms such as [[Coca-colonization]] have been coined to refer to the dominance of American products in foreign countries, which some critics of globalization view as a threat to the cultural identity of these nations.

===Conflict intensification===

Another alternative perspective argues that in reaction to the process of cultural globalization, a "[[Clash of Civilizations]]" might appear. Indeed, [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] emphasizes the fact that while the world is becoming smaller and interconnected, the interactions between peoples of different cultures enhance the civilization consciousness that in turn invigorate differences. Indeed, rather than reaching a global cultural community, the differences in culture sharpened by this very process of cultural globalization will be a source of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|title=The Clash of Civilizations|journal=Foreign Affairs|year=1993|volume=72|issue=3|pages=22–3, 25–32, 39–41, 49|doi=10.2307/20045621|jstor=20045621}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not many commentators agree that this should be characterized as a 'Clash of Civilizations', there is general concurrence that cultural globalization is an ambivalent process bringing an intense sense of local difference and ideological contestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=2010 | author= Paul James and Manfred Steger | title= Globalization and Culture, Vol. 4: Ideologies of Globalism | url= https://www.academia.edu/4510893 | publisher= Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, [[Benjamin Barber]] in his book ''[[Jihad vs. McWorld]]'' argues for a different "cultural division" of the world. In his book the McWorld represents a world of globalization and global connectivity and [[interdependence]], looking to create a "commercially homogeneous global network". This global network is divided into four imperatives; [[Market (economics)|Market]], [[Resource]], [[information technology|Information-Technology]] and the [[Ecological]] imperative. On the other hand, "[[Jihad]]" represents traditionalism and maintaining one's identity. Whereas "Clash of Civilizations" portrays a world with five coalitions of nation-states, "Jihad vs. McWorld" shows a world where struggles take place on a sub-national level. Although most of the western nations are capitalist and can be seen as "McWorld" countries, societies within these nations might be considered "Jihad" and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Lechner and John Boli., ''The Globalization Reader: Fourth Edition'', Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''culture of [[Liberia]]''' reflects this nation's diverse ethnicities and long history. Liberia is located in West Africa on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]].

== Languages ==
{{Further|Languages of Liberia}}

[[File:Escritura bassa vah.png|thumb|300px|The [[Bassa alphabet|Bassa Vah alphabet]].]]
The official language of Liberia is English.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt; There are also more than 16 indigenous languages.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=LR Ethnologue report for Liberia]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most widely studied Liberian languages in schools and universities are [[Kpelle language|Kpelle]] and [[Bassa language|Bassa]] languages and to a lesser extent, [[Vai language|Vai]]. [[Loma language|Loma]] and [[Mende language|Mende]] also have their own unique alphabets but are studied less.

Both languages are noted for their unique alphabets and phonetics that are not based on the [[Latin alphabet]], or any [[European language]] but emerged from visions of each language's inventor. Bassa [[alphabet]] was popularized by Dr. Thomas Narvin Lewis in the early 20th century, after attending studies in the U.S at [[Syracuse University]]. He modeled it after he came into contact with former slaves of Bassa origin in Brazil and the West Indies who were still using the alphabet. Vai is another well known ancient script from Liberia, but distinct from the Bassa alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/bassa.htm Bassa language and alphabet]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the listed alphabets, Bassa Vah is compared to include [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]], [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] (used by Egyptian Coptic and Coptic Church), [[Avestan]] used in [[Ancient Persia]] to write sacred [[hymns]] of [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Georgian language]] in [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Meroitic alphabet]] of ancient [[Sudan]] and parts of [[Nile Valley]], and many other ancient scripts, Greek-based and [[Cyrillic]] alphabets. Some Vah letters resemble certain letters from the [[Ge'ez]] alphabet of [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]], [[N'ko]] alphabet in [[Guinea]], and Armenian alphabet.&lt;ref name="Tim Slager"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://cefliberia.org/extras/IndigenousScripts.pdf |title = A Brief Summary of Liberian Indigenous Scripts |author = Tim Slager |date = March 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080820044000/http://www.cefliberia.org/extras/IndigenousScripts.pdf |archivedate = 2008-08-20 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The syllabary of Vai also been compared to [[Hiragana]] and [[Katakana]] scripts also syllabary for Japanese language. However many linguists hold that Bassa and Vai alphabets are unique in their own right for being African languages with alphabets alongside Ge'ez, N'ko, and [[Tifinagh]] (used to write Berber languages) that are neither influenced by Latin or Western [[writing system]].&lt;ref name="Tim Slager"/&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Further|Religion in Liberia}}

According To the 2008 National Census, 85.5% of [[Liberia]]'s population practices [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148698.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2010: Liberia |work=United States Department of State |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslim]]s comprise 12.2% of the population, largely coming from the [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]] and [[Vai people|Vai]] ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

=== Belief in traditional supernatural world ===
Regardless of public statements of identification with Christianity, a "vast majority"&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jOo6fCPSt0QC&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=Poro&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q=Poro&amp;f=false ''Culture and customs of Liberia'', by Ayodeji Olukoju, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006, p. 24.]&lt;/ref&gt; of Liberians believe a supernatural world of ancestral and bush spirits that impact daily life.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Ethnic groups in all regions of Liberia participate in the traditional religious practices of the [[Poro]] and [[Sande society|Sande]] secret societies, with the exception of the [[Krahn people|Krahn]] ethnic group, who have their own secret society.&lt;ref name="Oo6fCPSt0QC 2006, p. 25"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jOo6fCPSt0QC&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=Poro&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q=Poro&amp;f=false ''Culture and customs of Liberia'', by Ayodeji Olukoju, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006, p. 25.]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Liberian religious culture is characterised by a predisposition towards secrecy (encapsulated in the concept of ''ifa mo'' - "do not speak it") and an ingrained belief in the intervention of mysterious forces in human affairs".&lt;ref name="Oo6fCPSt0QC 2006, p. 25"/&gt; "Both elite and non-elite Liberians usually attribute events to the activities of secret powers and forces".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jOo6fCPSt0QC&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=Poro&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q=Poro&amp;f=false ''Culture and customs of Liberia'', by Ayodeji Olukoju, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006, p. 23.]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Beliefs include the conviction that there are deep and hidden things about an individual that only diviners, priests, and other qualified persons can unravel.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; This presupposes that whatever exists or happens in the physical realm has foundations in the spirit world".&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

=== Secret societies ===
While still belonging to Christian or Muslim denominations, ethnic groups in all regions participate in religious secret societies associated with the spirit world, including the [[Poro]] and [[Sande society|Sande]] gender-based secret societies.&lt;ref name="Leopold, Robert S. 1983"&gt;[Leopold, Robert S. (1983) ''The Shaping of Men and the Making of Metaphors: The Meaning of White Clay in Poro and Sande Initiation Society Rituals''. Anthropology 7(2): 21-42.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harry Sawyerr 1970"&gt;[[Harry Sawyerr (theologian)|Sawyerr, Harry]] and S. K. Todd (1970) ''The Significance of the Numbers Three and Four among the Mende of Sierra Leone''.  Sierra Leone Studies (n.s.) 26: 29-36.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Sande society champions women's social and political interests and promotes their solidarity vis-a-vis the [[Poro|Poro society]], a complementary secret society for men. The Poro society is found among the [[Bassa people (Liberia)|Bassa]], [[Gola people|Gola]], [[Kissi people|Kissi]], [[Kpelle people|Kpelle]], [[Loma people|Loma]], [[Mano people|People]] and [[Vai people|Vai]] of Liberia.&lt;ref name="Leopold, Robert S. 1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harry Sawyerr 1970"/&gt;

== Media culture ==
{{Further|Communications in Liberia}}
[[File:The Daily Talk.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Daily Talk]]'' is a street blackboard announcing news on Monrovia's Tubman Boulevard.]]
Numerous newspapers, radio stations and TV programs are broadcast and can be heard in the capital Monrovia, coastal cities and towns and countryside. Radio, newspapers and online news articles are the main form of mass communication in Liberia in recent years, surpassing TV stations as the most accessible forms of media to Liberians. Many popular FM radio stations have their headquarters in [[Monrovia]] along with several major national newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiostationworld.com/locations/liberia/radio_websites.asp Liberia: Radio Station Websites] - RadioStationWorld&lt;/ref&gt;

Many radio stations are community based operated by joint [[United Nations]] and community councils, activists, youth groups, universities and neighborhood programs. The major radio stations in Liberia are UNMIL Radio, Radio ELWA, Truth Radio, ELBC Radio, and [[STAR radio]]. All have programs available to listen to online. There are currently no AM radio stations (which existed before the war) but there are a few shortwave stations. Radio also serves to promote peace, reconciliation and connect the country both rural and urban Liberians through community based apprenticeship programs for youths and young adults.

The most widely read newspapers include the ''[[Liberia Herald]]'', ''The Analyst'', ''[[Liberian Observer]]'', ''The News'', ''The Heritage'', and ''The Inquirer'', among others. Several Liberian journalists have been awarded national and international awards and acclaim around the world for their commitment to [[press freedom]] and promotion of Democracy in [[post war]] countries and regions.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Liberia}}

Liberia has its own ancient music and instruments. While Liberian music is part of wider [[West African]] music heritage, it is also distinct from its neighbors. There are several different types of drums used in traditional music. [[Drums]] are one of the most widely used instruments in many ceremonies both official and nonofficial, weddings, christenings, naming ceremonies, holidays, graduations, etc. Next to drums, beaded [[gourd]] rattles called Saasaa are also used in mainstream music by many Liberian singers, musicians, and [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] across the country.

Songs are sung in both English and all indigenous languages. Other instruments similar to the [[xylophone]] include Yomo Gor. Music is a main highlight of Liberian culture not only used as entertainment but to educate society on issues ranging from culture, politics, history to human rights.

[[Religious music]] is also popular. [[Christian music]] is heavily influenced by its counterpart in United States regardless of region. Islamic [[nasheeds]] popular in many countries with Muslim communities are almost unheard of in Liberia. Instead, music for Liberian Muslims are based on [[Quran]]ic citations, adhan and music related to everyday life called suku. Aside from religious and traditional music, [[rapping|rap]] and HiLife are widely popular especially with younger Liberians and American music aficionados. Both can be heard in discothèques, parties, clubs and on radios throughout the country. Jazz, funk, soul, rap and a new music style or Liberian rap called Hipco combining rap, R&amp;B, traditional rhymes, and joint Liberian and American influences are part of the wider Music of Liberia.

=== Crafts ===

[[File:WeeSpoon.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Liberian ceremonial spoon]]
Liberia is renowned for its detailed decorative and ornate masks, large and miniature [[wood carvings]] of realistic human faces, famous people, scenes of everyday life and accessories particularly combs, spoons and forks which are often enlarged sculptures. Sculptures are produced in both the countryside and cities. Liberian wood curved sculptures are heavily influenced by ancient history predating modern Liberia, folklore, proverbs, spirituality, rural life and show the artist's strong observations for grand detail and their connections to the people and objects sculpted. Liberian artists both in the country and [[diaspora]] have also gained recognition for various styles of paintings in abstract, perspective and [[graphic art]].

Due to its strong relationship with the United States, Liberia has also produced its own American-influenced quilts. The free and former US slaves who emigrated to Liberia brought with them their sewing and quilting skills and was originally done by [[Americo-Liberians]] beginning in the 19th century. [[Queen Victoria]] invited Martha Ann Ricks, on behalf of Liberian Ambassador [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]], to [[Windsor Castle]] on 16&amp;nbsp;July 1892.&lt;ref name="Kyra E. Hicks 2006"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Martha Ann's Quilt for Queen Victoria |author = Kyra E. Hicks |publisher = Brown Books Publishing Group |year = 2006 |isbn = 978-1-933285-59-7 |oclc = 70866874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricks, a former slave from [[Tennessee]], had saved for more than fifty years, to afford the voyage from Liberia to England to personally thank the Queen for the [[Royal Navy|British navy's]] actions against the slave trade. Ricks shook hands with the Queen and presented her with a Coffee Tree quilt, which Victoria later sent to the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] for display. A mystery remains as to where the quilt is today.&lt;ref name="Kyra E. Hicks 2006"/&gt;

The census of 1843 indicated a variety of occupations, including hatter, milliner, seamstress and tailor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.disc.wisc.edu/Liberia/ |title = Roll of Emigrants to Liberia, 1820&amp;ndash;1843 and Liberian Census Data, 1843 |last = Shick |first = Tom W. |publisher = University of Wisconsin-Madison |accessdate = 2008-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberia hosted National Fairs in 1857 and 1858 in which prizes were awarded for various needle arts. However today, Liberians from all ethnic groups make quilts though it is not a popular as it once was when the country was adapting American customs, culture and lifestyle in mid 19th century. In modern times, Liberian presidents would present quilts as official government gifts, and when current Liberian President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] moved into the Executive Mansion, she reportedly had a Liberian-made quilt installed in her presidential office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://allafrica.com/stories/200603240593.html?page=2 |title = Liberia: It's the Little Things - A Reflection on Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's Journey to the Presidency |author = Riva Levinson |date = 24 March 2006 |work = allAfrica.com |accessdate = 2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===

A literary tradition has existed in Liberia for over a century. Liberia had no written tradition until the 19th century. Numerous Liberian authors throughout the years have contributed to the writings of various genres. They have written on [[folk art]], ancient proverbs, everyday life in countryside, city life, religion and observation of their own lives. Culture, tradition, identity, society, taboo subjects, human rights, equality and diversity within Liberia, multiculturalism, [[Pan-Africanism]], [[colonialism]] and its reverberating consequences today, post colonial African countries and future of the country have been featured in novels, books, magazines and novelettes since the 19th century.

Poetry is a prominent canon of Liberian literature. Many authors have presented their pose in all poetic styles. Often adding their own unique perspectives, writing styles and observation of the material and spiritual worlds into their books. Liberia's prominent writers also share a variety of genres that cross several decades.
[[File:Blyden E W 3c35638r.jpg|thumb|Edward Wilmot Blyden]]
In the 19th century, [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]] was the most renowned Liberian author. A diplomat, educator, statesman and writer, Blyden was considered one of the early fathers of Pan Africanism along with [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[Marcus Garvy]]. His writings revolved around the need for Africans to develop their own identity, be culturally, spiritually and politically aware of their own potential and preside over their own self-rule and to disprove the European view of Africans as culture-less. These writings inspired many Liberian authors in later years and still does today. In the end, he is known in world history and on African continent as the genius behind the phrase, "Africa for Africans!" and later inspired Marcus Garvey's [[Back to Africa]] Movement. Blyden is a national hero in Liberia.

During the 20th century and currently in first decade of the 21st century, other authors have taken a less political but prominent role in Liberian literature. Several authors are renowned for their starling, detailed and deep observation of Liberian life both in the country and abroad in Diaspora in Europe or United States. Authors [[Bai T. Moore]], E.G. Bailey, [[Roland T. Dempster]], [[Wilton G. S. Sankawulo]], have all reflected on culture, tradition, modernization and pain of exile, loneliness, lost and remembrance in fiction, and non fiction works.

Bai T. Moore's novelette ''[[Murder in the Cassava Patch]]'', is often required reading for many Liberian high school students. Published in 1968, the novelette is based on true story of a murder that discusses the most taboo subjects in mid-20th century Liberia as the story reveals the lives of the main characters and their hometown. E.G. Bailey is a [[spoken word]] artist, theatre and radio producer.

Politician and author Wilton G. S. Sankawulo published many collections of poems and stories which later became praised anthologies on Liberian folklore and wider African literary tradition entitled, More Modern African stories. His most celebrated book is Sundown at Dawn: A Liberian Odyssey. According to the book's publisher, Dusty Spark Publishing, it is regarded as "one of the literary achievements of postwar Liberia and contemporary Africa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Sundown at Dawn: A Liberian Odyssey |year = 2005 |author = Wilton Sankawulo |publisher = Dusty Spark |isbn = 978-0976356509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Liberian cuisine}}

Liberian cuisine has [[rice]] as its staple. Other ingredients include [[cassava]], [[Fish (food)|fish]], [[banana]]s, [[citrus fruit]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[coconut]], [[okra]] and [[sweet potato]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.celtnet.org.uk/recipes/liberia.php |title=Celtnet Liberian Recipes and Cookery |work=Celtnet Recipes |accessdate=July 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903234346/http://www.celtnet.org.uk/recipes/liberia.php |archivedate=September 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy [[stew]]s spiced with [[habanero]] and [[scotch bonnet]] chillies are popular and eaten with [[fufu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodbycountry.com/Kazakhstan-to-South-Africa/Liberia.html |title=Liberia |work=Food in Every Country |accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6052">'''Cyberpathology''' refers to the phenomena that "individuals can become overly attached to their computers, computer games, or the Internet and spend inordinate amounts of time in front of their monitors".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Norman, K.L. (2008). Abnormal Behavior and Cybertherapies. In Cyberpsychology: An Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It may cause physical and psychological damages to the individual, for examples, insufficient amount of sleep, limited face-to-face interactions, and impacting on daily life activities.&lt;ref&gt;Kalwar, S. K., Heikkinen, K., &amp; Porras, J. (2011). Finding a relationship between internet anxiety and human behavior. In Human-Computer Interaction. Design and Development Approaches (pp. 359-367). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberpathology shares many of the same core symptoms of behavioral addictions,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; such as salience, mood modification, tolerance, [[withdrawal symptom]]s, conflict, and [[relapse]].

==Disorder categories==

===1. Computer and internet addiction===
* [[Cybersex]]
* [[Online gambling]]
* [[Online auction]]s
* Online communications/[[Computer-mediated communication]]

===2. Computer anxiety===
In contrast to [[computer addiction|computer]] and [[Internet addiction]], computer anxiety refers to "a state of heightened tension or a feeling of apprehensive expectation".&lt;ref&gt;Howard, G.S. (1986). Computer anxiety and management use of microcomputers. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral presentations of computer anxiety include: "(1) avoidance of computers and the general areas where computers are located; (2) excessive caution with computers; (3) negative remarks about computers; and (4) attempts to cut short the necessary use of computers".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Bozionelos, N. (2001). Computer anxiety: relationship with computer experience and prevalence. Computer in Human Behavior, 17, 213-224.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer anxiety is mainly assessed by self-report scales using Likert-type formats.

Age, gender, and computer experience are thought to be associated with computer anxiety. A meta-analysis based on studies published between 1990 and 1996 found that: (1) female university undergraduates are generally more anxious than male undergraduates, but the strength of this relationship is not conclusive; (2) instruments measuring computer anxiety are generally reliable, but not compatible with one another; and (3) computer anxiety is inversely related to computer experience, but the strength of this relationship remains inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Chua, S.L., Chen, D., &amp; Wong, A. F. L. (1999). Computer anxiety and its correlates: a meta-analysis". Computers in Human Behavior, 15, 609-623.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bozionelos&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; found that the youngest sample with the presumably earliest exposure to computerization reported the highest computer anxiety scores and demonstrated the highest prevalence rates. Also, Wilfong&lt;ref name="Wilfong"&gt;Wilfong, J.D. (2006). Computer anxiety and anger: the impact of computer use, computer experience, and self-efficacy beliefs. Computers in Human Behavior, 22, 1001-1011.
&lt;/ref&gt; found that computer experience did not have the largest significant relationship with computer anxiety.

===3. Cybergenic stress syndrome===
It is defined by Norman&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; as "that constellation of interrelated emotional, physiological, and behavioral signs and symptoms that accompany frustration, irritation, and hostility which, although provoked by interaction with computer hardware, software, network, and related 'help' systems, results in aggression toward people or organizations to the ultimate detriment of the person affected."

===4. Computer anger/rage===
[[Computer rage|Computer anger]] is defined by Wilfong&lt;ref name="Wilfong"/&gt; (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;1003) as "strong feelings of displeasure and negative cognitions in response to a perceived failure to perform a computer task." A similar term is computer rage, which is defined by Norman&lt;ref&gt;Norman, K.L. (2005). Computer rage and frustration: Results of an online survey. Technical Report LAP-2005-01. college Park: Laboratory for Automation Psychology and Decision Processes, University of Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; as "the physical bashing and verbal abuse of a computer or computer-related item." Wilfong&lt;ref name="Wilfong"/&gt; (2006) found that computer self-efficacy beliefs had the largest significant relationship with both computer anxiety and anger. Likert-type scales can be used to measure computer anger.

==Online help==
Individuals with symptoms of cyberpathology could turn to a computer for psychological help. There are large amounts of mental health information available online. And the number is growing dramatically with time. However, the information varies greatly in reliability.

Psychologists also looked into the possibility of conducting psychotherapy online (e.g., Christensen, Griffiths, &amp; Jorm, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Christensen,H., Griffiths, K.M., &amp; Jorm, A.F. (2004). Delivering interventions for depression by using the Internet: Randomised controlled trial. British Medical Journal, 328(7434), 265-269.&lt;/ref&gt; Griffiths, 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, M. (2005). Online therapy for addictive behaviors. CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior, 8(6), 555-561.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mallen, 2005&lt;ref&gt;Mallen, M.J. (2005). Online counseling: Dynamics of process and assessment. Ph.D. dissertation, Ames: IA: Iowa State University.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Offline help==
[[Group therapy]] could be used to help individuals with symptoms of cyberpathology. Family supports are also important in helping those individuals.

'''''Daemon''''' and '''''[[Freedom™|Freedom&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;]]''''' comprise a two-part novel by the author [[Daniel Suarez (author)|Daniel Suarez]] about a distributed, persistent computer application, '''The Daemon''', that begins to change the real world after the original programmer's death.

==Plot==
Upon publication of the obituary for Matthew A. Sobol, a brilliant computer programmer and CTO of Cyberstorm Entertainment, a [[Daemon (computing)|Daemon]] is activated. Sobol, dying of brain cancer, was fearful for humanity and began to envision a new world order. The Daemon becomes his tool to achieve that vision. The Daemon's first mission is to kill two programmers Joseph Pavlos &amp; Chopra Singh who worked for CyberStorm Entertainment and unknowingly helped in the creation of the Daemon.

The program secretly takes over hundreds of companies and provides financial and computing resources for recruiting real world agents and creating AutoM8s ([[Autonomous car|computer controlled driverless cars]], used as transport and occasionally as weapons), Razorbacks (sword-wielding robotic riderless motorcycles, specifically designed as weapons) and other devices. The Daemon also creates a secondary online web service, hidden from the general public, dubbed the [[Darknet]], which allows Daemon operatives to exchange information freely.

What follows is a series of interlocking stories following the main characters:

'''Detective Pete Sebeck''' is called in to investigate the death of Pavlos. However, when a connection is made between the two programmers and Cyberstorm, the FBI takes over led by Agent Decker. For being the first authority figure in the investigation, the Daemon selects Sebeck against his will to serve the Daemon, which frames Sebeck for its creation as a multi-million scheme and a hoax. The US government, though knowing the truth, fasttracks Sebeck's trial and executes him eight months later. Sebeck makes peace with his wife, who loves him despite Sebeck's having an affair, but his son Chris remains estranged, and he proclaims his innocence while dying from lethal injection. However, Sebeck later awakens to learn that the Daemon faked his death and assigned him the task to prove that humanity deserves its freedom from the Daemon. Joined by a fellow operative named Laney Price, Sebeck vanishes into America.

'''Jon Ross''', a Russian hacker and identity thief, is questioned by the FBI and brought into the investigation by Sebeck. Unfortunately, traditional investigation methods are useless against Sobol's Daemon program. Ross eventually deduces that the Daemon can anticipate their every move, seemingly one step ahead of anyone who tries to interfere with its operation. Even after being named in the Daemon hoax (and put on the FBI's most wanted list), Ross willingly helps the US government to stop the program. Assigned to the NSA's anti-Daemon task force, with Agent Phillips, he is a firsthand witness to Loki's attack on the installation and barely survives the massacre that follows. With his immunity deal rescinded, he vanishes underground with the intent on destroying the Daemon on his own.

'''Agent Roy "Tripwire" Merritt''' a decorated FBI agent is brought in to secure Sobol's property, when several FBI agents and police officers are killed by an automated Hummer that attacks anyone who approaches. A longtime military officer and expert in hostage situations, he realizes that Sobol's estate is a death trap and red herring, but fear of the Daemon forces his hand and his team is ordered to secure the site regardless. His team is quickly killed, and he remains the lone survivor, infiltrating the house and accidentally triggering a bomb, which levels the property. Blamed for the failure, he is relieved of duty but is later brought onto the anti-Daemon task force by the Major. When Loki is revealed to have infiltrated the building, Roy pursues him, against orders. Fearful of the publicity that the chase will generate, the Major kills Roy himself. Despite being an enemy to the Daemon, he becomes a folk hero of the Darknet, known as "The Burning Man" by the Darknet users, who respect him for his tenacity.

'''NSA Agent Natalie Philips''', a genius workaholic government cryptographer. Phillips joins the investigation shortly after the FBI is called in. Eventually, she is placed in charge of the anti-Daemon task force, but she finds plenty of interference from the Major. She is attracted to Jon Ross (the attraction is mutual), but she quickly states that national security will take precedence and their relationship will remain professional. Phillips objects to the murder of Sebeck to protect infected corporate systems from the Daemon's wrath. One of a handful survivors from Loki's attack, Phillips is blamed for the failure and relieved of duties.

'''Brian Gragg''' aka "Loki Stormbringer" is a sociopathic loner and avid gamer. He makes a living through identity theft and other cyber crimes. After running afoul of some hackers from the Philippines, he allows his partner in crime, Jason Heider, to be killed in his place. Needing to lie low, Loki is recruited by the Daemon by outthinking a hidden game level in one of Sobol's games. Loki is the first Daemon operative and quickly becomes one of the most powerful operatives. His behavior, though useful to the Daemon, is hated and feared even by other Darknet members. His first major act is to infiltrate the anti-Daemon task force. When found out, he quickly triggers an attack, which leaves most of the people and agents there dead. He is pursued by Roy Merritt, as he escapes and witnesses the Major executing Roy, vowing to kill the Major for betraying his own man.

'''The Major''', unnamed throughout the series, is introduced as a secret DOD liaison assigned to the daemon task force. Soon, everyone who encounters him realizes that his history is checkered, and his loyalty remains with the military-industrial complex now under attack by the Daemon. When Loki massacres the task force, he quickly contains the situation by destroying all evidence (including leveling the building) and personally executing Roy Merritt, fearful that Merritt's pursuit of Loki will attract too much attention. Realizing that they have underestimated the Daemon and its network, the Major retreats and prepares to wage a secret war against the Daemon and its agents.

'''Anji Anderson''' is a recently fired reporter, whose good looks have hindered her career for years. Having been relegated to fluff pieces and put on the air to be pretty, she is quickly recruited as a Daemon operative, her job to investigate stories that benefit the Daemon and help push its propaganda. Her main effect in the story is to help frame Sebeck.  She eventually becomes the spokesman for the Daemon.

'''Charles Mosely''' is a former drug dealer and convicted killer recruited by the Daemon, which helps him to escape prison by transferring him first to minimum security and then releasing him altogether. With a new identity, he travels to a Daemon-controlled office where he is interrogated by the Daemon's AI and is deemed acceptable to serve. He eventually becomes a security operative, assigned jobs such as executing criminals, participating a massive worldwide assassination of spammers who corrupt the internet. Mosley's only request is for the Daemon to locate his missing son and protect him. Ray is both found and sent to live with Daemon agents, who will raise and educate Ray in a safe family-like setting.

==Dutton purchase==
On June 25, 2008, the [[E. P. Dutton|Dutton]] imprint of the [[Penguin Group]] purchased ''Daemon'' and the rights to the sequel ''Freedom™'' from Verdugo Press.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[http://verdugopress.com/ Daemon by Leinad Zeraus Acquired by Dutton]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton has since achieved foreign rights sales worth over $1 million.

==Film adaptation==
[[Walter F. Parkes]], who produced the 1983 film ''[[WarGames]]'', had optioned the film rights to ''Daemon'' with [[Paramount Pictures]],&lt;ref name="WSJ When"&gt;{{cite web|last=Trachtenberg |first=Jeffrey A. |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123678059330595141 |title=When Computers Rule the World |publisher=online.wsj.com |date=March 18, 2009 |accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they likely reverted to Suarez on 8 December 2012.&lt;ref name="Suarez film"&gt;{{cite web|last=Suarez |first=Daniel |url=https://plus.google.com/+DanielSuarez/posts/SjC6iVZGfCb |title=Status of 'Daemon' Movie |date=November 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dave the Barbarian''''' is an American [[cartoon series|animated]] [[television series]] created by [[Doug Langdale]] for [[Disney Channel]]. The show centers on a barbarian named Dave and his friends and family, who go on surreal Medieval-themed adventures. The series premiered on January 23, 2004&lt;ref name=bcdb&gt;"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Walt_Disney_Studios/Television/Dave_The_Barbarian/ Dave The Barbarian]". ''www.bcdb.com'',  May 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and ended on January 22, 2005, with a total of one season and 21 episodes. Reruns aired from January 23, 2005 to December 28, 2009. Reruns have also aired on ''[[Toon Disney]]'' until February 13, 2009 when the channel shut down.

== Premise ==
The series takes place in the kingdom of [[Ostrogoths|Udrogoth]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. It centers on Dave (voiced by [[Danny Cooksey]]), a powerful yet cowardly [[barbarian]] who lives with his older sister Candy ([[Erica Luttrell]]) and younger sister Fang ([[Tress MacNeille]]). His parents, Throktar and Glimia, are the King and Queen, but are away "fighting evil" across the world (though they sometimes communicate via a magic [[crystal ball]] or [[cauldron]]), and have left Candy in charge of the kingdom as Princess Regent while Dave is supposed to defend the kingdom (since he is the biggest). Together the three siblings, along with their "wizard" uncle Oswidge, are left to run and protect the kingdom.

There is a [[Narrator]], referred to either as "the Narrator" or "the Storyteller." He is able to talk to the characters of the show, and vice versa, which [[fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]]. In fact, he was once captured by The Dark Lord Chuckles the Silly Piggy, and was forced to tell the story from his kidnapper's commands.

== Characters ==

===Main===
*Dave (voiced by [[Danny Cooksey]]) – The middle child and only brother of the three siblings. Dave is a muscular and very strong barbarian war-prince who is very sensitive to pain and would rather knit and cook than fight evil. He is also afraid of many things and at least once an episode, he will be frightened somehow and shriek his high-pitched, effeminate scream. He is also allergic to many things. According to Fang, Dave wanted to be a barbarian when he was young, but thought a barbarian was a librarian who also cuts hair. Dave's catchphrases are "Bajabbers" and "Please don't hurt me!"
*Candy (voiced by [[Erica Luttrell]]) – The oldest child of the three siblings. Left in charge while the king and queen are away, Candy has a contemporary "[[valley girl]]" attitude and would rather shop and hang out than rule a kingdom. Candy's main ability is her martial arts skills. She is the kingdom's most beautiful girl and she's rather selfish, but gets over that in a small way while helping Hamwise and his wife defeat the nefarious Invisigoths. Candy has used the quote "Don't mess with the princess" on a number of occasions and has referred to herself also as a Barbarian. She has displayed the most strength out of the family often when it comes to monsters destroying a shop or so; whether or not she is stronger than Dave remains unseen but out of the two, she is the one willing to use it.
*Fang (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) – The youngest of the three siblings. Fang is a very rambunctious and uncivilized tomboy who loves to smash things. She has long red hair in a ponytail. She resembles a cross between both [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]] and [[Bamm-Bamm]] of ''The Flintstones''. She is the butt of a running joke in which she is often mistaken for a [[monkey]], hence her catchphrase, "Not a monkey!". However, she frequently acts and appears to look like a monkey and during one episode she finds a tribe of monkeys that exactly resemble her. She is too small to fight most of the time and resents Dave (who is very strong) because of his cowardice. Although she aspires to be a tough barbarian princess (ala [[Xena]]), she secretly likes to play with dolls. Fang wields a spear in combat.
*Oswidge (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) – Dave, Fang and Candy's uncle. A rather clumsy [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerer]] who usually wreaks havoc with his spells rather than being useful. It was revealed in the episode "Sorcerer Material" that he never really went to sorcerer school, he just worked in the cafeteria. Uncle Oswidge loves to eat and presents a rather unkempt appearance. Like his niece Fang, he secretly likes to play with dolls. His favorite foods are ham and "Nut Logs" and cannot resist them. His knowledge of magic and magical items, and most other things, surpasses the rest of the family.
*Faffy (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) – The family's dumb pig-shaped pet dragon.  Unlike most dragons, he breathes lightning and is domesticated, plus he does not have a tail. He does possess a wild streak that can be revealed when around other dragons, particularly evil ones with rebellious attitudes. It is mentioned in the show that Faffy has a one digit IQ.
*Lula (voiced by [[Estelle Harris]]) – Dave's shrill, impatient, sarcastic enchanted [[sword]]. Her main ability is shooting a [[lightning discharge]] from the tip of her blade. She was once the sword of Argon the Ageless, but was used by Argon as the nose of a snowman, and left there for centuries.

===Supporting===
*King Throktar and Queen Glimia (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] and [[Erica Luttrell]]) – The proper rulers of Udrogoth, and the parents of Dave, Candy and Fang. They are away fighting evil around the world, though they can communicate to their children via Oswidge's crystal ball, which seems to operate like a phone. Occasionally they are called while in a terrible situation.
*The Narrator/Storyteller (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]]) – The narrator of the series. He has never been seen in an episode.
*Dinky and Cheezette (voiced by [[Erica Luttrell]] and [[Tress MacNeille]]) – Princess Candy's best friends, who are sometimes unsupportive – and wisely so – towards her actions. They are as obsessive about fashion, clothes, and social lives as Candy is.
*Mrs. Gert Bogmelon (voiced by Lisa Kaplan) – A witch-like shopkeeper who loves money and loves to rip off her customers. She can be cowed by Fang and other aggressive people but takes advantage of meek people like Dave. She sells evil weasels, mystical swords, and other plot-related [[paraphernalia]], such as used T-shirts for sporting events.
*Twinkle The Marvel Horse (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]]) – A magical pony with a rainbow-colored tail. He suffers from extreme depression and possible psychosis, apparently due to being left on his own in the stable all the time. He often talks about his dreams, which are very disturbing.  He is capable of flight, though he has no wings. His manner of speech is a parody of [[Christopher Walken]]. He appears in the episodes 'Ned Frischman: Man of Tomorrow', 'Beef!', 'The Terror of Mecha-Dave', 'The Lost Race of Reeber', 'A Pig's Story', 'I Love Neddy' and 'Fiends and Family'.

===Antagonists===
*The Dark Lord Chuckles the Silly Piggy (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]) – A pig with a high-collared cape (and equally high voice) bent on ruling Udrogoth and the main antagonist of the show. Chuckles lives in a castle on the outskirts of the kingdom. He possesses the Mystic Amulet of Hogswineboar (named so because hogs, swine, and boars are all synonyms for the word 'pig'). This grants him amazing mystical powers such as [[telekinesis]], [[shape-shifting]], blasting magic to rival Lula's, and conjuration. He is also a whiz with [[technology]], as evidenced by the Mecha-Dave. His schemes usually rely on a particular gimmick (like giant clams, giant ducks, evil pastries, or evil furniture). His catchphrase is: (whenever he gets hurt) "Ooh, my little piggy [insert body part]". It was also revealed in one episode (the Princess and the Peabrains') that he has a nephew named Knuckles the Silly Piggy, who wants to be the Harvest Hog instead of a dark lord of evil.
*Malsquando (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) – An evil sorcerer and Oswidge's rival. He has an obsession with taking over the world and making money. He was revealed to be a member of the Evil Sorcerers' union. He also runs a shop that cures hiccats (magical hiccups that produce cats from one's mouth). Unlike Oswidge, he actually went to wizards' school. His speaking pattern is based on that of [[Jonathan Harris]].
*Quosmir (voiced by [[Mike McShane|Michael McShane]]) – The god of freshly laundered trousers, overused punctuation and possibly other random and ridiculous things. He has mommy issues and carries a security blanket known as his "ni-ni lankie". He often experiences short-term memory loss and [[attention deficit disorder]]. He is a green skinned [[Nāga|naga]]-like giant with the lower half of a snake instead of legs; he is always wearing a blue cape and a combover. He has a severe [[inferiority complex]] that is only exacerbated in the presence of his mother. He has immense magical powers including flight, super-speed, and flaming loogies.
*Princess Irmaplotz and Queen Zonthara (voiced by [[Melissa Rivers]] and [[Joan Rivers]]) – The evil [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] [[princess]] of Hyrogoth that is trying to destroy Dave (or more likely she just wants to make Dave's life miserable). Her mother Zonthara is the ruler of Hyrogoth, and keeps on trying to teach Irmaplotz to be more evil. Her father is good, making her half-evil. Earlier in the show, Dave and Irmaplotz fell in love, but Dave decided that they were too different, and ended up dumping her, where she is now seeking revenge. She still may have feelings for him though; she once got the chance to destroy Dave, but she chose not to do so. She is similar to Dave in that they both have the same odd hobbies and interests (she and Dave both love "bad [[poetry]]" for example). She also has the same allergies as Dave. She is very beautiful and an intellectual; she would be a great match for Dave, only if she were not an evil princess. She occasionally wears glasses (she has stated that she does not like to wear them as she feels they make her look bookish, even though she cannot see things from far away without them), due to her being [[nearsighted]]. In the episode "The Cow Says Moon" She still has feelings for Dave after saying nice things about him while saying that vengeance will be hers.
*Ned Frischman (voiced by [[Richard Steven Horvitz]]) – A [[nerd]] who works at a pants factory in the year 1994. He gains a radioactive zipper which he uses to travel back into time to attempt conquering the world by using the advanced technology of the future, such as the Game Guy (a parody of a [[Game Boy]]), and a joke book from the 1940s, both plans of which were thwarted by Dave and his family (Though he is defeated by Faffy, Lula and Twinkle the marvel horse because they do not have thumbs to play on the Game Guys).

== Production ==
The show was created and written by [[Doug Langdale]]. After premiering on Disney in 2004, it began broadcasting on Toon Disney a year later. In [[Latin America]], the show was broadcast on [[Jetix]].

Much like its predecessors ''Hagar the Horrible'', ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and the short-lived ''[[The Roman Holidays]]'', ''Dave the Barbarian'' [[Anachronism|juxtaposes both the ancient and modern]]. Candy, for example, shops in the local mall and uses the crystal ball for online shopping sprees.  Occasionally, the series even breaks the [[fourth wall]] with a character directly addressing the audience or even communicating to the narrator.

In [[philology]], '''decipherment''' is the discovery of the meaning of texts written in ancient or obscure languages or scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, R.L (2000). ''The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics''. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, p. 82 ("The process of determining the relation between an extinct and unknown writing system and the language it represents. Strictly, decipherment is the elucidation of the ''script''—that is, determining the values of the written characters")&lt;/ref&gt;  Decipherment in [[cryptography]] refers to [[decryption]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaudenay, Serge (2006). ''A Classical Introduction to Cryptography''. Springer, p.3. ("Action to transform a ciphertext into a plaintext by an ''authorized party'' [emphasis added]")&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used sardonically in everyday language to describe attempts to read poor handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/decipherment&lt;/ref&gt; In [[genetics]], decipherment is the successful attempt to understand [[DNA]], which is viewed metaphorically as a text containing word-like units.&lt;ref&gt;Snustad, D. Peter, et al. (2016). ''Principles of Genetics''. Wiley, p.302&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout science the term decipherment is synonymous with the understanding of biological and chemical phenomena.

==Ancient languages==
In a few cases, a multilingual artifact has been necessary to facilitate decipherment, the [[Rosetta Stone]] being the classic example. Statistical techniques provide another pathway to decipherment, as does the analysis of modern languages derived from ancient languages in which undeciphered texts are written. Archaeological and historical information is helpful in verifying hypothesized decipherments.

'''''Dishonored''''' is a 2012 [[Stealth game|stealth]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game developed by [[Arkane Studios]] and published by [[Bethesda Softworks]]. Set in the fictional, plague-ridden industrial city of Dunwall, ''Dishonored'' follows the story of [[Corvo Attano]], bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles. He is framed for her murder and forced to become an assassin, seeking revenge on those who conspired against him. Corvo is aided in his quest by the Loyalists{{mdash}}a resistance group fighting to reclaim Dunwall, and [[The Outsider (Dishonored)|the Outsider]]{{mdash}}a powerful being who imbues Corvo with magical abilities. Several noted actors including [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Brad Dourif]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Michael Madsen]], [[Lena Headey]] and [[Chloë Grace Moretz]] provided voice work for the game.

The game is played from a [[First person (video games)|first-person]] perspective and allows the player to undertake a series of assassination missions in a variety of ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions can be completed through stealth, combat, or a combination of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are changed in response to the player's violent actions or lack thereof. Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.

During its three years in production, several versions of ''Dishonored'' were developed. Before the creation of Dunwall—inspired by late nineteenth-century London and Edinburgh—the game was set to take place in medieval Japan and seventeenth-century London. During development, test players discovered methods of exploiting the available powers and abilities to achieve unexpected outcomes; instead of restricting these techniques, the designers attempted to redesign levels to accommodate them. ''Dishonored''{{'}}s music score was produced by composer [[Daniel Licht]] to represent London in the nineteenth century.

''Dishonored'' received positive reviews, focusing on the missions' individual narratives and the freedom available in completing them. Criticism fell on the overarching narrative, which was considered predictable, and problems in controlling the player's character. The game won several awards, including the 2012 [[Spike Video Game Awards|Spike Video Game]] award for Best Action-Adventure Game and the 2013 [[British Academy Video Games Awards|BAFTA]] award for Best Game, and was repeatedly recognized as the best action-adventure game of 2012 and one of that year's best games. ''Dishonored'' was initially released on 9 October 2012, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]], and was later supplemented with additional content focusing on the assassin Daud and his quest for redemption. [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] versions of the game were released in August 2015, and a sequel, ''[[Dishonored 2]]'', was released in November 2016.

== Gameplay ==
''Dishonored'' is an [[action-adventure game]] played from a [[First person (video games)|first-person]] perspective with an emphasis on [[Stealth game|stealth]] action and the use of gadgets and the environment to eliminate opposing forces.&lt;ref name="GPlayThird"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Openworld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevVerge"/&gt; The game world is a series of self-contained, mission-focused areas designed for multiple avenues of exploration in terms of in-game movement and powers.&lt;ref name="Openworld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevTelegraph"/&gt; Between missions, the player is taken to a central hub called the Hound Pits pub where the player character Corvo can meet with his allies, receive mission briefings and alternate objectives, and convert recovered loot into new equipment and upgrades.&lt;ref name="RevTelegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gameplay70"/&gt; In-game areas include loading docks, royal estates, poverty-stricken streets, and a bathhouse.&lt;ref name="Gameworld"/&gt; The player can [[Saved game|save]] their progress anywhere, and the game includes a checkpoint save system. Saving is disabled during combat.&lt;ref name="PowerDarkVision"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevJoystiq"/&gt; The game has four difficulty levels which modify the effectiveness of [[Health (gaming)|health]] and mana (magic) potions, and enemies' awareness, damage delivered, and responsiveness. In the easy setting, health regeneration is possible.&lt;ref name="GameplayOXM"/&gt;

''Dishonored'' features [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] elements, such as the ability to upgrade powers and to make moral choices with a focus on non-linear consequences.&lt;ref name="Gameplay50"/&gt; The game is designed to allow the player to complete it without killing any non-player characters (NPC), including boss characters and mission targets. An example of a non-lethal situation given by co-creative designer [[Harvey Smith (game designer)|Harvey Smith]] involved the player completing a side mission for a character, and in return that character had two of Corvo's targets kidnapped and enslaved.&lt;ref name="Gameplay5"/&gt; Each mission contains multiple ways to explore and reach targets. Movement through and exploration of levels is designed to support the player character's abilities, rather than specific paths that are aimed at a particular gameplay style, such as hacking or sneaking.&lt;ref name="Powers1"/&gt; Specific elements of missions, such as changes to the color of a target's clothing and mask in one mission are randomized, requiring the player to explore the game area to find the target each time the mission is played.&lt;ref name="GameRandom"/&gt;

The player's actions are not judged to be good or evil, but instead are tracked by a "chaos" system that records the amounts of friendly fire, violence, and deaths the player causes. This modifies the game world, affecting the story without punishing the player or forcing them to choose one style of play over another.&lt;ref name="Gameplay5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powers1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gameplay1"/&gt; For example, an NPC who disapproves of violence may refuse to support the player, or may even betray them.&lt;ref name="Setting3"/&gt; The game reacts to the chaos caused in scripted ways, such as changing dialogue, and dynamic ways, such as increasing the presence of rats and plagued citizens and adding new scenes. This can affect the active mission and future missions.&lt;ref name="Openworld"/&gt; The system also influences which of the game's two endings is reached, with variations based on which characters live or die.&lt;ref name="Gameplay40"/&gt; Using violence allows missions to be completed in less time than using a stealth approach, but violence consumes more in-game resources such as health and mana potions, which are required more often in direct combat.&lt;ref name="Gameplay5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gameplay1"/&gt;

===Abilities and powers===
[[File:Dishonored Video Game - Gameplay.ogv|thumb|300px|thumbtime=0:02|Gameplay emphasizes combining different abilities to overcome or bypass obstacles. The player summons rats, slows time so that they can attach a weapon to a rat and then possess that specific rat, before walking it to the enemy, killing them. The player then teleports to subdue a difficult-to-reach enemy. (0:34)|alt=Video sample of the game]]

''Dishonored'' features six active powers, four passive powers or ''enhancements'', and forty ''bone charms'' which grant the player supernatural perks, such as the ability to increase the duration of rat possession.&lt;ref name="Gameplay40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gameplay12"/&gt; Initially, only three bone charms can be active at any time; up to six can be active through optional upgrades.&lt;ref name="PowerSK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PowerSK2"/&gt; Smith and designer [[Raphaël Colantonio]] stated that it is impossible for a player to accrue all of the powers and abilities in a single playthrough. The player requires mana to use these abilities; mana partially regenerates after use to allow "Blink" and "Dark Vision" powers to be used, but mana potions are required to regenerate more mana, restricting the use of higher cost abilities like "Possession" and "Bend Time".&lt;ref name="Gameplay12"/&gt; Magic and ranged weapons are assigned to the player character's left hand control and a sword is assigned to the right hand control.&lt;ref name="Setting3"/&gt;

The main supernatural powers are unlocked and purchased using ''runes''—artifacts carved from whale bone—and each can be upgraded.&lt;ref name="Gameworld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gameplay41"/&gt; Powers include "Dark Vision", which allows the player to see enemies through walls, their field of view and highlights interactive objects;&lt;ref name="PowerDarkVision"/&gt; "Blink", a short-distance teleportation ability;&lt;ref name="AccoE32012K"/&gt; "Possession", that allows the player to temporarily inhabit and possess other characters; "Devouring Swarm", which summons a swarm of deadly rats; "Bend Time", that slows or freezes time;&lt;ref name="Gameworld"/&gt; "Wind Blast", a gust of wind that can knock down enemies;&lt;ref name="RevTelegraph"/&gt; and "Shadow Kill" that turns dead enemies to ash, preventing their discovery by opposing forces.&lt;ref name="PowerSK3"/&gt; The player can use weapons including a sword, grenades, a crossbow, and pistols.&lt;ref name="Weapons"/&gt; Coins must be collected to upgrade weapons and gadgets.&lt;ref name="Gameplay40"/&gt;

Stealth is based on limiting the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, and as long as Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also look through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms.&lt;ref name="GameplayOXM"/&gt; Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead bodies can be moved and hidden.&lt;ref name="GameplayHiding"/&gt;

Guards have several states of alertness, ranging from normal to suspicious; they can become aware of the player's presence or can actively search for them.&lt;ref name="GameplayGF"/&gt; Enemy [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] (AI) will respond to sound and can be distracted using sound to lure guards away from their positions.&lt;ref name="Sound"/&gt; If the player remains concealed from guards, their alertness will drop to "aware", but it will not return to normal in that mission. Enemies communicate their states of alertness to their allies, increasing the alertness level throughout the mission.&lt;ref name="GameplayGF"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
''Dishonored'' takes place in the industrial city of Dunwall, where technology and otherworldly forces coexist.&lt;ref name=reled/&gt; The city's design is modeled on [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]] between the late 1800s and the early 1900s.&lt;ref name="Setting1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Setting2"/&gt; The capital of the Empire of the Isles, Dunwall, is ruled by an oppressive regime that came to power following the assassination of the Empress and the kidnapping of her daughter.&lt;ref name="RevCVG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Empire"/&gt; The city is a center for fishing and whaling; whale oil is a valuable resource which is needed to power the city.&lt;ref name="Cast4"/&gt; After a philosopher discovered that whale oil—known in the city as trans—can be used as a fuel, the government used it to develop powerful weaponry, which in turn bred government corruption.&lt;ref name="SettingOil"/&gt; The city is stricken with a plague spread by rats, which is killing the poor and isolating the rich. The infected, known as "weepers", cry blood and can become violent.&lt;ref name="Gameplay30"/&gt; The government uses the plague as an excuse to take or purge citizens as they wish.&lt;ref name="Setting3"/&gt; Order is maintained by the Tallboys, heavily armored officers on tall, mechanical legs, and districts are separated by barriers known as "Walls of Light", which are made of energy and disintegrate unauthorized people who try to cross them.&lt;ref name="Setting3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gameplay30"/&gt; A covert group of activists, the Loyalists, plots to overthrow the government and install the Empress' daughter as the new Empress.&lt;ref name="RevCVG"/&gt;

===Characters===
[[File:Chloe Grace Moretz Cannes 2014 3.jpg|upright|thumb|Actress [[Chloë Grace Moretz]] voiced the young princess Emily Kaldwin, her second video game voice acting role.]]

The main character of ''Dishonored'', whom the player controls, is [[Corvo Attano]], the former bodyguard to Dunwall's Empress Jessamine Kaldwin ([[April Stewart]]).&lt;ref name="CastList"/&gt; Corvo becomes an infamous assassin after he is framed for the empress' murder. He is skilled in stealth and combat, is armed with unusual gadgets, and possesses great supernatural powers.&lt;ref name="Gameplay1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastCorvo2"/&gt; The game designers chose Corvo to [[Silent protagonist|remain silent]] so that players could project themselves onto the character.&lt;ref name="CastCorvo"/&gt; Corvo is aided by the Loyalists, led by Admiral Havelock ([[John Slattery]]),&lt;ref name="RevCVG"/&gt; and members: Piero Joplin ([[Brad Dourif]]){{mdash}}an inventor who builds Corvo's mask and supplies him with gadgets; Treavor Pendleton (Derek Phillips){{mdash}}a member of parliament; Samuel ([[Ryan Cutrona]]){{mdash}}a commoner who ferries Corvo to and from his missions; Overseer Teague Martin (Joel Johnstone); and Callista Curnow ([[Lena Headey]]){{mdash}}the caretaker for the Empress' daughter Young Lady [[Emily Kaldwin|Emily]] ([[Chloë Grace Moretz]]). Other characters include Granny Rags ([[Susan Sarandon]]){{mdash}}a former aristocrat now blind and deranged after years of living on the streets; Daud ([[Michael Madsen]]){{mdash}}leader of a group of assassins known as "the Whalers"; and Slackjaw (Al Rodrigo){{mdash}}a gang leader. [[Carrie Fisher]] and [[Gregg Berger]] provide the voices of the loudspeakers found throughout the city relaying government propaganda.&lt;ref name="CastList"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cast"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cast2"/&gt;

[[The Outsider (Dishonored)|The Outsider]] ([[Billy Lush]]) offers to help Corvo in his quest. Described as a mixture of God and the Devil, The Outsider imprints his mark on Corvo, imbuing him with magical abilities,&lt;ref name="Cast4"/&gt; and provides him with a mechanically altered human heart (April Stewart)&lt;ref name="CastList"/&gt; that tells Corvo secrets. The Outsider also grants his mark, and special abilities, to other characters.&lt;ref name="RevGiantBomb"/&gt; Smith described the character as an amoral figure who grants abilities, but leaves the choice of how to use them up to the recipient.&lt;ref name="Development50"/&gt;

Corvo's targets include the Lord Regent Hiram Burrows ([[Kristoffer Tabori]]){{mdash}}the Empress' former spymaster who masterminded her death and framed Corvo, and now controls Dunwall;&lt;ref name="CastCorvo"/&gt; Burrows' lover Lady Boyle ([[Anna Graves]]){{mdash}}an aristocrat funding the military;&lt;ref name="CastBoyle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastBoyle2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastBoyle3"/&gt; Lords Custis and Morgan known as the Pendleton Twins (Zach Hanks){{mdash}}members of parliament;&lt;ref name="CastPendleton"/&gt; High Overseer Campbell ([[Daniel Hagen]]){{mdash}}leader of the city's religious order; and Anton Sokolov ([[Roger L. Jackson|Roger Jackson]]){{mdash}}a genius inventor responsible for the creation of many advanced technologies including the Wall of Light.&lt;ref name="CastList"/&gt;

===Plot===
After returning from a foreign voyage to seek aid with the deadly plague ravaging the city, Corvo Attano travels to the tower of Dunwall and meets with the Empress. After delivering a message, they are attacked by teleporting assassins led by Daud; they magically restrain Corvo, kill the Empress and kidnap her daughter Emily. The Empress' Spymaster arrives and has Corvo imprisoned for her murder and Emily's abduction.&lt;ref name="PlotChapter1"/&gt; Six months later, the Spymaster has seized control of Dunwall as Lord Regent. Interrogating Corvo, the Lord Regent confesses that he masterminded the assassination and framed Corvo.&lt;ref name="PlotChapter1B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PlotChapter2"/&gt; The following day, Corvo is due to be executed. In his cell, a letter from Empire Loyalists is smuggled to Corvo, and he is given the means to escape. After escaping, Samuel ferries Corvo to the Hound Pits pub to meet the Loyalists, led by Admiral Havelock.&lt;ref name="PlotChapter2B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PlotChapter3"/&gt;

While resting at the pub, Corvo is taken to a dream world where he meets the Outsider, who brands Corvo with his mark. Corvo is sent by the Loyalists to eliminate the conspirators behind the Lord Regent's plot, and the player is given the option to kill or otherwise neutralize Corvo's targets, the first of which is High Overseer Campbell.&lt;ref name="PlotChapter3"/&gt; During the mission, Corvo meets Granny Rags and Slackjaw. Corvo removes the High Overseer and discovers that Emily is being held in a brothel called the Golden Cat under the supervision of twins Custis and Morgan Pendleton. Corvo rescues Emily and eliminates the brothers.&lt;ref name="PlotChapter4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PlotChapter5"/&gt; After returning to the pub, Emily is taken into the care of Callista to prepare her for becoming Empress, while Corvo is sent to abduct the genius scientist Sokolov, who is responsible for the Lord Regent's powerful technologies. Sokolov is taken to the pub for interrogation, under which he divulges the identity of the Lord Regent's financier, Lady Boyle. Corvo infiltrates Boyle's masquerade ball, deduces which of the three sisters is the Lord Regent's mistress, and disposes of her.&lt;ref name="PlotChapter6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PlotChapter7"/&gt;

After returning to the pub, Havelock confirms they have done enough damage to move on the Lord Regent. Corvo infiltrates the tower of Dunwall and removes the Lord Regent from power and, in the process, learns that the Lord Regent intentionally imported the plague to decimate the lower classes of society, though things quickly got out of hand.&lt;ref name="PlotChapter8"/&gt; Corvo returns to the Hound Pits pub where the Loyalists celebrate their success. After sharing a drink, Corvo goes to his room and collapses. Upon waking he  learns that his drink was poisoned by Samuel at the behest of Havelock and his Loyalist allies Treavor Pendleton and Teague Martin to prevent him interfering in their plan to install Emily as Empress and rule through her. Samuel remains loyal to Corvo and had given him a non-lethal dose of poison. Samuel sets Corvo adrift on the river and flees.&lt;ref name="PlotGeneral"/&gt; When Corvo wakes, he is a prisoner of the assassin Daud and his men, who killed the Empress and intend to claim the bounty placed on Corvo's head by the now Lord Regent Havelock.&lt;ref name="PlotChapter9"/&gt;

Corvo defeats Daud and his assassins before traveling through Daud's territory and into the sewers where he finds Granny Rags attempting to cook Slackjaw. Corvo can eliminate either Slackjaw or Granny Rags, who is revealed to be a witch called Vera Moray.&lt;ref name="PlotGeneral"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PlotChapter9"/&gt; Corvo returns to the pub to find it overrun with guards and that Havelock has killed many of the Loyalists. He discovers where Havelock has taken Emily, and can save Piero, Sokolov and Callista. Corvo signals to Samuel, who ferries him to the former Lord Regent's lighthouse.&lt;ref name="PlotChapter10"/&gt; He infiltrates the lighthouse and either subdues Pendleton and Martin or finds that Havelock, to ensure the Loyalists' actions are never known, has already killed them.&lt;ref name="PlotGeneral"/&gt; Once finished with Havelock, Corvo may or may not rescue Emily. Havelock's journal reveals that the Lord Regent suspects that Emily is Corvo's daughter.&lt;ref name="PlotDaughter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PlotDaughter2"/&gt;

The ending varies depending upon the level of chaos the player has caused throughout the game. If Corvo saves Emily, she ascends the throne as Empress with Corvo at her side. If only a small amount of chaos has been caused, a golden age dawns and the plague is finally overcome. After many decades, Corvo dies of natural causes and Empress Emily Kaldwin I the Wise buries him beside Empress Jessamine.&lt;ref name="PlotEndingGood"/&gt; If much chaos is caused, the city remains in turmoil and is overrun with the plague. If Corvo fails to save Emily, Dunwall crumbles and Corvo flees the city by ship.&lt;ref name="PlotGeneral"/&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Harvey-Smith-in-Montreal-2007.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' designer [[Harvey Smith (game designer)|Harvey Smith]] served as one of ''Dishonored''{{'}}s two creative directors.]]

Bethesda Softworks first announced ''Dishonored'' as a first-person, stealth, action-adventure game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 platforms on 7 July 2011. ''Dishonored'' is the first [[Arkane Studios]] game Bethesda published after Bethesda parent [[ZeniMax Media]] bought Arkane in August 2010. Arkane Studios founder Raphaël Colantonio and ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' developer Harvey Smith were the game's creative directors,&lt;ref name="Development10"/&gt; and ''Deus Ex'' designer Ricardo Bare was its lead technical designer.&lt;ref name="Development11"/&gt; Visual design director Viktor Antonov, who designed  ''[[Half-Life 2]]''{{'s}} [[City 17]], and art director Sebastien Mitton led the art team.&lt;ref name="Development10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Development1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gameplay13"/&gt; Smith, Colantonio, Antonov, and Mitton spent three years in pre-production.&lt;ref name="Gameplay13"/&gt; Bethesda approached Arkane and asked them to develop a new game and a new intellectual property. The team already had ideas for developing a similar game, but until Bethesda approached them, Arkane had no specific ideas.&lt;ref name="Development201"/&gt; Mitton contacted Antonov in May 2009 to ask for his help to establish an artistic identity for a new intellectual property.&lt;ref name="Gameplay13"/&gt; The full Arkane team{{mdash}}including their offices in Lyon, France, and Austin, Texas{{mdash}}worked on the game.&lt;ref name="ArkaneTeam"/&gt;

The game supports a different interface for Microsoft Windows users to that for the console versions, and also supports the use of Xbox 360 controllers on Windows PCs. Smith described the team's philosophy of allowing its developers who are passionate about a particular release platform to develop software for it; those passionate about PC will work on developing that interface, while Xbox 360 aficionados were allowed to develop the [[Achievement (Xbox 360)#Gamerscore|Achievements for that platform]].&lt;ref name="Interface"/&gt; ''Dishonored'' was officially [[Software release life cycle#Release to manufacturing .28RTM.29|released to manufacturing]] on 28 September 2012.&lt;ref name="DevGold"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DevGold2"/&gt;

===Gameplay===
The development team researched unexpected ways the player could combine Corvo's special powers, such as combining a high jump with the ability to teleport in order to travel greater distances than either ability allowed independently. Instead of restricting these exploits, the team tried to design levels to accommodate them.&lt;ref name="Setting3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Development50"/&gt; The designers did not consider all of the powers they conceived during development, such as a power to become a shadow that could move along walls, to be suitable for the game.&lt;ref name="Gameplay40"/&gt; Some existing powers went through several revisions: a version of "Bend Time" caused the player to unfreeze enemies when touched; "Possession" allowed the player to control a victim remotely without inhabiting their body, but this offered less challenge.&lt;ref name="PowerChanges"/&gt; Balancing the effectiveness of the player's powers was considered difficult. Colantonio said, "we wanted to give [the player] very strong powers, to make [the player] really a badass, but at the same time we didn't want the game to be too easy." Each power has a duration, mana cost, and other variable properties that allowed the team to effectively scale even the most destructive of abilities by making them costly to use frequently or limiting the time they remain active.&lt;ref name="Powers1"/&gt;

''Dishonored''{{'}}s stealth system was originally based on that of the [[Thief (series)|''Thief'' series]], which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence. However, it was decided that it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them. It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas.&lt;ref name="Developemtn100"/&gt; Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking.&lt;ref name="DesignGrossman"/&gt;

To design the missions, the designers began with a cohesive area, which they filled with activities for the player. They defined paths to the target areas, and developed and expanded them. They then populated the areas with NPCs, which they assigned to patrol routes and functions. The designers would then observe how players interacted with the level, using their abilities and powers to test whether the area provided a suitable challenge for the available powers, and then redesigned the level as needed.&lt;ref name="Development50"/&gt; At first, the levels featured little directional information to emphasize the player's ability to traverse them as they choose, but in testing, players became lost or obeyed NPC commands to not enter an area, leaving them unable to proceed. In response, the developers introduced more visual cues and verbal hints to direct players.&lt;ref name="Development201"/&gt; Some features and ideas were removed during the design process, including a mental institution where Corvo would have faced sound-sensitive patients.&lt;ref name="DesignMitton"/&gt; Discussing the use of violence and the consequences of in-game freedom, developer Joe Houston recounted his experience while watching a tester play a mission to infiltrate a masquerade ball; Houston determined that not killing the NPCs opened up more objectives and interactions, but the tester systematically killed every NPC in the level, which Houston found disconcerting.&lt;ref name="DevHouston"/&gt; The team came under pressure to excise a scene from the end of the game where Samuel, in response to a player killing indiscriminately throughout the game, can betray Corvo by alerting enemies to his presence. Smith explained "Everybody just wants to be told in a video game that you’re great, no matter what you do. If you slaughter everybody – you killed the maids, you killed the old people, you killed the beggars – you’re great, here’s a medal, you’re a hero... We decided that sounds psychotic. It doesn’t match our values... What we wanted was to let you express yourself in the game, but to have the world react to that, at least in some way. [Samuel], betraying you and firing off that flare, was something we had to fight for."&lt;ref name="DevelopmentSamuel"/&gt;

===Design===
[[File:Grimshaw-NightfallThames.jpg|thumb|''Dishonored''{{'}}s mood was partly inspired by the works of nineteenth-century artist [[John Atkinson Grimshaw]], depicting London at night.]]

''Dishonored'' was originally set in medieval Japan, but the idea was dropped early in the game's development because of the difficulties presented in marketing the setting, and because no member of the design team knew much about the culture.&lt;ref name="RevSpotJapan"/&gt; Arkane moved the setting to London in 1666, considering that the city was recognizable to Europeans and Americans. Later designs inspired by added gameplay mechanics such as floodlights, electrified barriers and 20th-century technologies that it no longer resembled London, and Arkane opted to develop a fictional city.&lt;ref name="Gameplay30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevSpotJapan"/&gt; The city of Dunwall, designed to be a "contemporary and cool" "period piece", was inspired by late-19th and early-20th-century London and Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="Gameplay30"/&gt; Describing why London had been an initial setting and remained a significant inspiration, Smith said:

{{quote|Because it was the last year of the plague, and the year of the great fire of London, which of course ended the plague by burning the slums down&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;In this kind of game you’re always looking for a way to up the tension and frankly make the world a little more perilous, and justify why there aren’t giant crowds of people at the market. Then people had the idea for swarms of rats, and we were talking independently about possession, and we wondered if you should be able to possess rats and if they could clean up corpses so you don’t have to hide them. All these pieces just worked together.&lt;ref name="Development50"/&gt;}}

Antonov described his inspiration from London as "a big metropolis, it's messy, it's chaotic and intense&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;and it's both exotic and familiar to Americans and to Europeans". He highlighted the importance of that familiarity to different cultures because "you want to communicate to a lot of people when you make a new piece of fiction". He said that Edinburgh provided a sense of containment and a variety of architectural designs, which were combined with a futuristic vision which Antonov said was not comparable to the brass, rivets, and steam of [[steampunk]] design.&lt;ref name="Gameplay13"/&gt; Antonov and Mitton traveled to London and Edinburgh for research, taking photographs of people, places, and objects. The pair avoided the busier streets and focused on side streets and alleyways that would better suit the game's world. Mitton stated: "We were trying to design the game from a rat's viewpoint&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;if we have a small city, from a constrained viewpoint, what are all the different angles that we can explore?".&lt;ref name="Design50"/&gt; Inspiration also came from the artwork of [[John Atkinson Grimshaw]], [[Canaletto]], and [[Gustave Doré]].&lt;ref name="DesignGDC13"/&gt; The world map was designed as a single piece of art and was sectioned so the designers were clear on where each mission takes place.&lt;ref name="CastCorvo"/&gt;

In-game characters were inspired by illustrations from adventure and pirate stories such as ''[[Captain Blood (novel)|Captain Blood]]'' (1922), the work of [[Charles Dana Gibson]], and mugshots from Edwardian London and Australia.&lt;ref name="Gameplay13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesignGDC13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesignImagine"/&gt; An anatomy expert helped ensure the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of character faces represented Great Britain, while Arkane maintained a sense of realism and political incorrectness.&lt;ref name="Gameplay30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gameplay13"/&gt; Mitton established defining groups for characters such as rich, poor, and hostile with specific anatomy and posture designs, and animators created stylized movements for each social class and specific characters to help convey emotions. The city guards, for example, have small heads, low shoulders, and big hands, with animations that blend human and monkey movements.&lt;ref name="DesignImagine"/&gt; Antonov and Mitton employed a textile carpet designer in Russia to design and paint some of the in-game art.&lt;ref name="Gameplay13"/&gt;

The designers conceived the Tallboys as [[town crier]]s. Stilts were later added after Mitton noticed someone cleaning their office façade while wearing stilts; the town crier role was replaced with loudspeakers throughout Dunwall.&lt;ref name="DesignMitton"/&gt; The Tallboy design evolved into a [[lamplighter]] that would light street lamps with whale oil tanks, but after further development, the designers considered that their tall, mechanical legs allowed them to burn the dead and deal with plague-infected citizens while remaining above them and avoiding infection, leading to their final design as a guard armed with a bow.&lt;ref name="DesignMitton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroDisect"/&gt; Mitton suggested adding a phosphorus canister to the Tallboys' backs for aesthetic reasons, but Smith suggested whale oil, which in turn led Mitton to design the whaling ships to give the whales a visible presence in the city.&lt;ref name="DesignMitton"/&gt; For other technologies, designers conceptualized using 18th-century technology to build modern items and vehicles, and creating 18th-century items using modern tools.&lt;ref name="DesignImagine"/&gt;

The Heart is a human heart modified with technology and the supernatural, that helps the player to find collectible items in the levels, and "plays a part related to informing [the player's] decisions about when to apply violence or not, making it a really interesting, more subtle part of the power fantasy." The Heart provides contextual verbal feedback to the player, offering insight into a particular location, the secrets or history of a character, and its own origins. The Heart was originally designed as a method of identifying assassination targets using vibration and sound mechanics. The design then developed into the concept of the Heart speaking and feeling alive and having its own agenda. As a result of player-conducted testing of the game, the designers decided that a more direct navigation system was required. The Heart's gameplay role continued to change, and it continued to provide narration on its perceptions of different characters, which helped to reinforce the narrative themes and to differentiate the city's social classes in a more subtle alternative to having the characters provide expository dialogue. Colantonio and Smith were concerned that optional use of the Heart would result in some players missing the information it provides, but they considered that it was a part of giving the player the freedom to choose how to play.&lt;ref name="DesignHeart"/&gt;

The Hound Pits pub, which acts as a base for the player, was initially a larger structure. Filling out the interior of the pub required too many stairs and rooms, and the large amount of climbing made navigation confusing. The team found retaining the large exterior they wanted while creating and disguising a smaller interior that was easier to traverse challenging. The pub's exterior was shrunk to resemble an [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] building, but the interior remained labyrinthine so Colantonio required that a chain be placed outside Corvo's bedroom, allowing him to reach the roof quickly. In frustration, the designers decided to simply close off the third floor entirely.&lt;ref name="EuroDisect"/&gt; The art team continued to receive requests throughout development, requiring them to extend pre-production until the end of the development cycle. Each design was hand drawn.&lt;ref name="Gameplay30"/&gt;

[[Daniel Licht]] composed the game's score—an ambient, violin-heavy presentation designed to represent 19th-century London.&lt;ref name="MusicLicht"/&gt; Licht's score is designed to make the player feel unsettled, and not provide comfort.{{sfn|Reese|Licht|2013|loc=1:44}} He described the music as an "evil fog" that fades in and out of the game without being initiated by any scripted moments or to warn of impending danger, instead creating the impression of ever-present danger.{{sfn|Reese|Licht|2013|loc=2:20}} As ''Dishonored'' features few cinematic scenes that allowed for long interactions with any particular character, Licht found himself limited in developing specific character themes, and instead focused largely on composing ambient music. Samples of Licht's ambient themes were used in the game's few cinematic scenes, although Licht was not involved in scoring them.{{sfn|Reese|Licht|2013|loc=3:20}} Licht conceived the score as a mixture of older music befitting the period setting, and 20th-century techniques such as reversed sounds.{{sfn|Reese|Licht|2013|loc=5:25}} ''Dishonored''{{'}}s credit song, "Honor for All", was written by Licht and his nephew Jon, who also provided the track's vocals. It was written as a reward for players who had finished the game.{{sfn|Reese|Licht|2013|loc=6:55}}

Bethesda Softworks developed a spin-off [[iOS]] game, ''Dishonored: Rat Assassin'', which it released free of charge on 30 August 2012. The game requires players to use a knife and crossbow to kill rats while avoiding bombs.&lt;ref name="IOSGame"/&gt; ''Rat Assassin'' was well received for the variety and quantity of content provided, but received some criticism for dark visuals, that made it difficult to see the rats. The game drew frequent comparisons to another mobile game, ''[[Fruit Ninja]]''.&lt;ref name="IOSGame"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RatAssassinRev"/&gt;

As part of the game's promotion, Bethesda employed [[COPILOT Music and Sound]] to develop the ominous "The Drunken Whaler", a modified version of the sea shanty "[[Drunken Sailor]]".&lt;ref name="MusicWhaler1"/&gt; Copilot decided to use ordinary children to sing the lyrics instead of a professional youth choir, aiming to achieve a dark, haunting quality to the music. However, they found it difficult to recruit children from local schools to sing about slit throats and hungry rats, and instead used child actors, adult singers who could imitate children, and the children of their friends.&lt;ref name="MusicWhaler2"/&gt; Instruments included violins, detuned and distorted guitars, and a "whaler stomp" created by the team, who stamped on wooden boards to create a pulsating sound.&lt;ref name="MusicWhaler2"/&gt; "The Drunken Whaler" appeared in the game's trailer and attracted a positive reception during its presentation at the 2012 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3). Following its debut, the trailer was watched over 850,000 times on YouTube, and it was awarded the [[Machinima]] Best Trailer award.&lt;ref name="MusicWhaler2"/&gt;

A set of three animated videos, titled ''Tales from Dunwall'', serving as a prequel to ''Dishonored'', were released in September 2012. The videos show the discovery of whale-oil fuel,&lt;ref name="SettingOil"/&gt; the Outsider granting his mark to a small boy in search of revenge,&lt;ref name="Marketing3"/&gt; and Piero creating Corvo's mask. All three videos were created by animation studio [[Psyop (company)|Psyop]] and marketing firm Rokkan, narrated by Chloë Grace Moretz, and scored by Daniel Licht.&lt;ref name="Marketing4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarketingPCGamer"/&gt; Each ''Tales from Dunwall'' episode received a gold [[Clio Awards|Clio Award]] for achievement in advertising.&lt;ref name="AccoClio"/&gt; In the same month, the game was used as inspiration for prosthetic makeup effects on the television reality show ''[[Face Off (TV series)|Face Off]]''.&lt;ref name="Marketing7"/&gt;

===Downloadable content===
[[File:Michael Madsen2.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Madsen]] in 2011. He reprised his role as the assassin Daud in ''Dishonored''{{'}}s story-based [[downloadable content]].]]

A variety of pre-order incentives were announced for the game, including a ''Dishonored''-themed, 72-card deck of [[Tarot]] cards, a USB whale-oil lamp, and a smartphone decal. DLC incentives offered in-game packs for the player character, including the "Arcane Assassin", "Shadow Rat", "Backstreet Butcher", and "Acrobatic Killer" packs that offer enhancements for the player character's abilities, money, and a statue of one of the game's creatures.&lt;ref name="PreOrder1"/&gt; "Dunwall City Trials", the game's first post-release DLC, was released on 11 December 2012, and contains 10 challenge maps. The player must defeat waves of enemies, complete time-trial challenges, and perform a series of drop assassinations in which the player kills a target by dropping from a location above the target.&lt;ref name="DLC2"/&gt;

Two story-based campaign DLC packs were announced in October 2012 for release in 2013, and follow the assassin Daud as he seeks redemption for murdering Empress Jessamine in ''Dishonored''{{'}}s main story.&lt;ref name="DLC1"/&gt; The first expansion, ''The Knife of Dunwall'' was released on 16 April 2013, on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. It features Daud (again voiced by Michael Madsen) as a playable character, with his own abilities including: "Void Gaze", which combines the functions of Corvo's "Dark Vision" with those of The Heart, guiding Daud to runes and bone charms; his own version of "Blink", which allows him to pause time; and an ability which allows Daud to summon his assassin followers. Additionally, Daud also has his own gadgets, such as stun mines, a concealed wrist-mounted bow, "Chokedust" grenade, which dazes enemies; and arc mines that disintegrate enemies. ''The Knife of Dunwall''{{'}}s plot runs parallel to that of ''Dishonored''{{'}}s, providing Daud's perspective on events, and introduces new locations, such as a whale slaughterhouse and Dunwall's affluent legal district. ''The Knife of Dunwall'' also features an additional difficulty level, "Master Assassin", which is made available after completing the content. ''Dishonored'' designer Ricardo Bare served as the content's creative director.&lt;ref name="DLC3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DLC4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DLC5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DLC6"/&gt; The second and final expansion is titled ''The Brigmore Witches'' and was released on 13 August 2013.&lt;ref name="DLC4"/&gt; ''The Brigmore Witches'' follows Daud's quest to stop the eponymous witches from enacting a powerful ritual that will doom him, and concludes with Daud's ultimate fate at the hands of Corvo in the core game. The DLC carries over player choices and upgrades from a ''The Knife of Dunwall'' saved game.&lt;ref name="DLC7"/&gt;

''Dishonored'' received &lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE TO CRITICAL ACCLAIM WITHOUT A SOURCE--&gt;positive reviews&lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE TO CRITICAL ACCLAIM WITHOUT A SOURCE--&gt; from critics. Aggregating review website [[GameRankings]] provides an average rating of 91% based on 14 reviews for the Microsoft Windows version,&lt;ref name="RevGRPC" /&gt; 90% based on 32 reviews for the PlayStation 3 version,&lt;ref name="RevGRPS3" /&gt; and 89% based on 38 reviews for the Xbox 360 version.&lt;ref name="RevGR360" /&gt; [[Metacritic]] provides a score of 91 out of 100 from 29 critics for the Microsoft Windows version,&lt;ref name="RevMCPC" /&gt; 89 out of 100 from 35 critics for the PlayStation 3 version,&lt;ref name="RevMCPS3" /&gt; and 88 out of 100 from 56 critics for the Xbox 360 version.&lt;ref name="RevMC360" /&gt;

''Dishonored''{{'}}s plot received a polarized response, with many reviewers praising the standalone stories driving each mission, but criticizing the game's overarching narrative. [[IGN]]'s Cam Shea said it is "a shame that ''Dishonored'''s story isn't greater than the sum of its decidedly memorable parts", and added, "''Dishonored'' is a game you'll talk with your friends about".&lt;ref name="RevIGN"/&gt; ''Eurogamer''{{'}}s Dan Whitehead, [[The Verge]]'s Arthur Gies, and [[Giant Bomb]]'s Patrick Klepek criticized the end of the game for its generic missions, "late narrative missteps",&lt;ref name="RevVerge"/&gt; and abrupt ending.&lt;ref name="RevGiantBomb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevEuroGame"/&gt; Klepek also criticized the repetitive ambient dialogue in the missions.&lt;ref name="RevGiantBomb"/&gt; Whitehead also stated that the unique, inventive, and distinctive missions allowed for memorable gameplay that subverted the overarching story. [[Joystiq]]'s Alexander Sliwinski was disappointed by the abrupt ending, and that the story did not explore much of the developed world of Dunwall, but said that the overall experience left him wanting more.&lt;ref name="RevJoystiq"/&gt;  In contrast, [[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'s Susan Arendt wrote that the story was well paced, and ''[[Shacknews]]''{{'}}s John Keefer stated that it was emotionally immersing and is "role-playing at its story-driven finest", but added that some plot points were not properly explained or developed.&lt;ref name="RevShack"/&gt;

The gameplay was generally praised for giving players freedom to use differing methods to complete objectives and to explore the levels. Keefer wrote that in-game mechanics like the powers and equipment are not essential and did not detract from the story,  but served as optional bonuses in levels that can be completed with creativity and cleverness. He also said that some missions offered too much freedom without guidance, leaving the player lost on how to proceed.&lt;ref name="RevShack"/&gt; According to Gies, the game can initially seem unstructured from a level-design perspective, but after exploring them it becomes clear about how much thought went into different actions a player can take, allowing them to experiment instead of focusing on rigid objective-driven design.&lt;ref name="RevVerge"/&gt; GameSpot's Chris Watters enjoyed the various pathways and methods of traversing each level with "compelling abilities", particularly the "Blink" power, and the freedom of choice which he said made ''Dishonored'' "one of the truly remarkable games of [2012]".&lt;ref name="RevGameSpot"/&gt; Arendt said that the game's flexibility was also a shortcoming, with certain playing styles favoring certain abilities that when fully upgraded, preclude the desire to explore levels for further enhancements and resources.&lt;ref name="RevEscapist"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Joe Juba also wrote that the game punishes players for taking certain paths, particularly one of violence, which results in more difficult gameplay and a perceived less satisfying ending, encouraging stealth over alternatives.&lt;ref name="RevGameInformer"/&gt; ''Kotaku''{{'}}s Jason Schreier contrasted ''Dishonored'' with other contemporary video games, and said that where other games may require a player to find a specific solution to defeat an enemy or solve a puzzle, ''Dishonored'' "feels like entering a designer's playpen", providing the player with an array of tools and then allowing them to experiment with how they interact with, or break, the world.&lt;ref name="RevKotaku"/&gt;

Reviewers also said that the game's variety encourages replaying. ''[[Computer and Video Games]]''{{'}} Alex Dale praised the variety and replayability of the game, and said, "''Dishonored'' doesn't demand you see everything it has to offer, although it is compulsive enough to ensure you will".&lt;ref name="RevCVG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevCVG2"/&gt; [[News.com.au|News.com.au's]] William Colvin  wrote that the game's only shortcoming could be that it offered too many options,&lt;ref name="RevNewscomau"/&gt; and Watters stated the game achieves a rare feat of being "compulsively replayable".&lt;ref name="RevGameSpot"/&gt; Problems in the player's control of Corvo were raised; Whitehead noted the controls were unresponsive when used in contextual situations. Sliwinski said that the controls worked well.&lt;ref name="RevJoystiq"/&gt;

Reviewers criticized the AI, which some found inconsistent. Whitehead criticized his experience of enemies that can see Corvo from a great distance yet sometimes remain unaware of him while in his enemies' peripheral vision.&lt;ref name="RevEuroGame"/&gt; Juba criticized the inconsistent detection by enemies that lead to unpredictable and unreliable stealth mechanics that could force stealth-focused players into a combat situation, for which their character is not built.&lt;ref name="RevGameInformer"/&gt; According to [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]]'s Jake Gaskill, the AI worked well in combat, with enemies employing different tactics and effectively countering attacks, but when not alerted, enemies would ignore actions directly in front of them.&lt;ref name="RevG4TV"/&gt; Watters also mentioned lulls in enemy intelligence, but he said that it remained tenacious enough to keep the enemies formidable.&lt;ref name="RevGameSpot"/&gt;

The game's visuals and design were generally praised; Gaskill said that the art style is unique and the game world is both vivid and fully realized, and Gies stated that the game has a "unifying vision and design that stands apart from its contemporaries as something different".&lt;ref name="RevVerge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevG4TV"/&gt; Colvin described ''Dishonored'' as "a triumph for the medium&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;that sets the benchmark for visuals, story, and character performance", and that it is "easily the best looking game you'll play this year."&lt;ref name="RevNewscomau"/&gt; Juba found the "steampunk-inspired" technology designs fascinating, and stated that the visual style and art direction offer a distinct aesthetic that accompanies the "dark and disturbing" lore found in the city.&lt;ref name="RevGameInformer"/&gt;

Reviewers likened ''Dishonored'' to well-received games from the early 2000s such as ''Deus Ex'' and the ''Thief'' video game series. ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''{{'}}s Tom Hoggins said it is like the "thinking man's games [from] the turn of the century which cherished player choice and control", comparing it against contemporary "noisy, brash thrill-rides obsessed with military ooh-rah and barely interactive set pieces".&lt;ref name="RevTelegraph"/&gt; Dale called ''Dishonored'' "one of the greatest games of this generation", and wrote that it excelled by drawing inspiration from older games and allowing players to figure out solutions without advice. Dale also called it the first true stealth game for a long time, and the closest comparison to ''Thief'' in the current generation of games.&lt;ref name="RevCVG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevCVG2"/&gt; Schreier stated that the game "[blends] the do-what-you-want structure of ''Deus Ex'' with the masterful world design of ''BioShock''."&lt;ref name="RevKotaku"/&gt;

The first installment of the story-based DLC ''The Knife of Dunwall'' was praised for its level design, which encouraged exploration to find hidden content and alternative routes through areas. The modifications to certain abilities, particularly Blink were similarly well received for the changes they brought to the gameplay from the main game.&lt;ref name="RevDLC1GSpot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevDLC1GIGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevDLC1GPoly"/&gt; The story, however, was generally criticized. [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] noted that the deadly assassin Daud had no motive for seeking redemption, and allowing him to be played as a non-lethal character created a disconnect with the narrative. IGN considered that it felt like only half of a complete game, lacking any urgency in its story and featuring a disappointing conclusion.&lt;ref name="RevDLC1GIGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevDLC1GPoly"/&gt; ''The Brigmore Witches''{{'}} story received a mixed response, with Destructoid saying that it offered a more gripping narrative,&lt;ref name="RevDLC2Dest"/&gt; while Polygon stated that it lacked the same tension as ''The Knife of Dunwall'', and the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying.&lt;ref name="RevDLC2PCGamer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevDLC2Poly"/&gt; However, the gameplay was generally considered an improvement, providing more intricate level design and nuanced world building that produced gameplay requiring a more thoughtful approach. PC Gamer appreciated that the levels each had a distinct theme, and adequately provided for both stealth and violent gameplay, while Polygon said that only the last level improved over the preceding DLC, introducing new mechanics that forced changes in stealth players.&lt;ref name="RevDLC2Dest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevDLC2PCGamer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevDLC2Poly"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1091">The '''''Encuentro Internacional de Escultura en Madera-Piedra-Hierro de Rosario''''' ("International Meeting of Wood-Stone-Iron Sculpture in Rosario") is an artistic event celebrated every year, since 1993, in [[Rosario]], [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[Argentina]]. It is organized by the Sculptors Association of Rosario.

This event is attended by sculptors from Argentina and a number of other countries, and lasts about a week. It is always celebrated outdoors and before the eyes of the public. The artists must work on a roughly 180&amp;times;50 cm trunk, or an irregular-shaped stone over 0.25 m³, or pieces of [[iron]], in order to create a sculpture. Stone and iron works are then placed in public places of the city.

A '''flexible seating classroom''' is one in which traditional seating charts are replaced with seating arrangements that allow the students to seat where they choose.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-10-01-why-the-21st-century-classroom-may-remind-you-of-starbucks Edsurge]&lt;/ref&gt; One of its principal objectives is to reduce the number/duration of [[Sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]] periods of time, which research has identified as a danger to health. The [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] Public School system in [[Virginia]] adopted this approach with reported success.

== Health impacts ==
Studies have found that extended sitting affects the development of the [[Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal system]], leading to health disorders such as [[cardiovascular]] problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McManus|first=Ali M.|last2=Ainslie|first2=Philip N.|last3=Green|first3=Daniel J.|last4=Simair|first4=Ryan G.|last5=Smith|first5=Kurt|last6=Lewis|first6=Nia|date=2015-11-01|title=Impact of prolonged sitting on vascular function in young girls|journal=Experimental Physiology|volume=100|issue=11|pages=1379–1387|doi=10.1113/EP085355|issn=1469-445X|pmid=26370881}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[poor posture]], [[back pain]] and [[neck pain]].&lt;ref&gt;Thariq, M. G., Munasinghe, H. P., &amp; Abeysekara, J. D. (2010). "Designing chairs with mounted desktop for university students: Ergonomics and comfort. International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics," 40(1), 8-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dieter Breithecker at Germany's Federal Institute for Posture and Mobilisation Support, [[brain activity]] slows down when the body becomes stationary, for example when sitting in a traditional classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Breithecker, D. (2006, November). "[http://www.designshare.com/index.php/articles/ Beware of the sitting trap in learning and schooling]" DesignShare [online]. (October, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Breithecker recommended flexible seating arrangements to remedy these dangers.

Flexible seating classroom designs include:
*stools
*couches
*beanbag chairs
*chairs
*beds
*mats
*inflatable balls
*standing
*laying on the floor
*pillows
*benches
*hanging chairs

[[File:Gammarelli (Roma).jpg|thumb|The [[pope|papal]] tailors shop, Gammarelli in [[Rome]]]]
'''Gammarelli''' (full name '''Ditta Annibale Gammarelli''') is the official tailor of the [[pope]]. The shop opened in 1798 and is located in [[Rome]].

== History ==
Gammarelli was created in 1798&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gammarelli.com/#storia&lt;/ref&gt; and has tailored for the popes since then. It has been run by the same family for 6 generations.&lt;ref name="latimes 2003/dec/25"/&gt;

The shop was created by [[Giovanni Antonio Gammarelli]]. His son Filippo took over the shop, and then Filippo's son, Annibale, succeeded his father. Annibale Gammarelli moved the store to 34 via Santa Chiara in the building of the [[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy]]. Annibale's sons Bonaventura and Giuseppe renamed the shop "Ditta Annibale Gammarelli". Bonaventura's son Annibale took over his father, followed by the sixth generation of the family: Maximillian, Lorenzo and Stefano Paolo.&lt;ref name="gammarelli chisiamo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gammarelli.com/ing/chisiamo.aspx?lingua=EN|title=About us|website=Gammarelli.com|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope [[Pius XII]] (1939-1958) is the only pope who selected a different tailor during his papacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/fashion/when-the-pope-is-chosen-his-tailors-will-be-ready.html|title=When the Pope Is Chosen, His Tailors Will Be Ready|website=Nytimes.com|date=8 March 2013|author=Guy Trebay|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the shop was included in the list of historic shops of Rome.&lt;ref name="gammarelli chisiamo"/&gt;

In 2016, the 6th generation of Gammarellis took over the leadership of the shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/gammarelli-legacy-passes-to-sixth-generation-of-papal-tailors-43421|title=Gammarelli legacy passes to sixth generation of papal tailors|website=Catholicnewsagency.com|date=15 July 2016|author=Elise Harris|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gammarelli makes [[zuchetto]]s, [[galero]]s (the wide-brimmed, tasseled hat that used to be worn by cardinals), and other high-ranking prelates. Gammarelli also sells world-famous red socks. The sign on the front of the shop says ''Sartoria Per Ecclesiastici'' (clerical outfitters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/3582288.stm|title=The Pope's new clothes|website=Bbc.co.uk|date=21 August 2004|author=Kieran Cooke|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of bestowing a galero to the cardinal when he entered the [[College of Cardinals]] was replaced with the presentation of their zuchetto after the [[Second Vatican Council]]. When a Cardinal dies, at a "[[Month's Mind]]", which is a [[requiem mass]] held a month after their death, the galero is raised to the roof of their cathedral, there to stay until it falls or deteriorates. In addition to Popes and Cardinals, it serves many [[Archbishop]]s, [[Bishop]]s, [[Monsignor]]s, and other [[prelate]]s and [[priest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-cardinal-george-red-hat-rising-met-20150517-story.html|title=Cardinal George's red hat rises to Holy Name rafters|website=Chicagotribue.com|date=17 May 2015|author=Manya Brachear Pashman|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global concerns about the '''gender disparity in computing''' occupations have gained more importance with the emerging [[information age]]. These concerns motivated [[public policy]] debates addressing [[gender equality]] as computer applications exerted increasing influence in society. This dialogue helped to expand information technology innovations and to reduce the consequences of [[sexism]].

== Background ==
{{See also|Women in computing}}
In the early days of computers and computing, women were well-represented in the field.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/researcher-reveals-how-“computer-geeks”-replaced-“computergirls”|title=Researcher reveals how “Computer Geeks” replaced “Computer Girls”|last=Frink|first=Brenda D.|date=1 June 2011|website=Gender News|publisher=Stanford University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312130252/http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/researcher-reveals-how-%E2%80%9Ccomputer-geeks%E2%80%9D-replaced-%E2%80%9Ccomputergirls%E2%80%9D#|archive-date=2015-03-12|dead-url=no|access-date=22 October 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often worked as "human computers," making complicated calculations and working in large groups, such as the [[Harvard Computers]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=82}} Women also worked on ballistics calculations and cryptography.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=130}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/women-were-key-code-breaking-bletchley-park-180954044/|title=Women Were Key to WWII Code-Breaking at Bletchley Park|last=Fessenden|first=Marissa|work=Smithsonian|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human computers who were women could be paid less than their male counterparts.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}} By 1943, the majority of human computers were women.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}} Many early programmers on machines such as [[ENIAC]], were mostly women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reason that women were involved as programmers and human computers was because "they expected programming to be a low skill clerical function," and that the difficult work was the creation of the hardware, which male engineers largely worked on.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The programmers of the ENIAC, six women who designed the public demonstrations and prepared the machine for its public debut were not fully recognized for their contributions by the media.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=51}}

By the 1960s, while computer programming was still touted as a good field for women to go into, major shifts were beginning to take place that would help push women out of the field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Men who were programming started to make the field more "prestigious," creating professional associations, education requirements for work and by actively discouraging hiring women in the field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hiring tools were introduced in which answers were shared among all-male groups and clubs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another way to push women out of the field was to use [[Personality test|personality tests]] that favored people who were not interested in working with others, which was slanted towards a certain type of male applicant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After these trends were entrenched in the industry, it has continued to perpetuate itself into the modern day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some computer science programs, such as [[Princeton University|Princeton]], in the mid-1960s wouldn't even admit women into their program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4892094/google-diversity-history-memo/|title=Women in Tech and the History Behind That Controversial Google Diversity Memo|last=Waxman|first=Olvia B.|date=8 August 2017|website=Time|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender gap==
A survey, conducted by SWIFT ("Supporting Women in Information Technology") based in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, asked 7,411 participants questions about their career choices. The survey found that females tend to believe that they lack the skill set needed to be successful in the field of computing. This study (as well as others) provides a strong base for a positive correlation between perceived ability and career choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Chan, Vania |author2=Stafford, Katie |author3=Klawe, Maria |author4=Chen, Grace |title=Gender Differences in Vancouver Secondary Students' Interests Related to Information Technology Careers |publisher=Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia |year=2000 |url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/swift/survey_stats/career_choice_survey/SurveyPaper.doc |access-date=2016-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221164825/http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/swift/survey_stats/career_choice_survey/SurveyPaper.doc# |archive-date=2007-02-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A project based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], "Strategies of Inclusion: Gender and the Information Society" (SIGIS) released its findings based on research conducted in 48 separate case studies all over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner, Wendy (2004). [http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/sigis/public/documents/SIGIS_D08_Final_Public.pdf "Strategies of Inclusion: Gender and the Information Society - Final Report"]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, SIGIS, University of Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings focus on recruiting as well as retention techniques for women already studying in the field. These techniques range from the introduction of role models, advertisement campaigns, and the allocation of quotas, in order to make the computing field appear more gender neutral.&lt;ref name="sigis"&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof Robin Williams|title=Getting More Women in Computer Science and Engineering|publisher=University of Edinburgh|url=http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/sigis/public/documents/SIGIS_D08_05_computing.pdf|access-date=2016-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716225701/http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/sigis/public/documents/SIGIS_D08_05_computing.pdf#|archive-date=2011-07-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educating reforms, which will increase the quality of the educating body and technological facilities, are also suggested.&lt;ref name="sigis" /&gt;

Research suggests that [[Malaysia]] has a much more equal split that varies around the half-way mark.&lt;ref name="mala"&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof. Vivian Anette Lagesen |title=A Cyberfeminist Utopia?: Perceptions of Gender and Computer Science among Malaysian Women Computer Science Students and Faculty|publisher=Sage Publications|url=http://sth.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/33/1/5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A job in the computing industry also implies a safe work environment. Strong belief by the previous generation that IT would be a flourishing sector with many job opportunities caused parents to encourage their children to take a computing career, no matter the gender.&lt;ref name="mala" /&gt;

In India, a growing number of women are studying and taking careers in technical fields. The percentage of women engineers graduating from IIT Bombay grew from 
1.8% in 1972 to 8% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simard |first=Caroline |url=http://anitaborginstitute.org/files/womenhightechworld.pdf |format=PDF |title= The state of women and technology fields around the world |publisher= Anita Borg Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women in Arab societies|Arab women]] made up 59% of students enrolled in computer science in 2014 at government universities located in Saudi Arabia.{{Sfn|Islam|2017|p=13}} Women in [[Eastern Europe]], especially in Bulgaria and Romania, have high rates of pursuing coding and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/women-in-tech-why-bulgaria-and-romania-are-leading-in-software-engineering/|title=Women in tech: Why Bulgaria and Romania are leading in software engineering {{!}} ZDNet|last=Fiscutean|first=Andrada|date=13 June 2017|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women remain underrepresented in information technology fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Varma | first1 = Roli | year = 2010 | title = Computing self-efficiency among women in India | url = http://www.unm.edu/~varma/print/JWMSE_CS%20Self%20Efficacy.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 257–274 | doi=10.1615/jwomenminorscieneng.v16.i3.40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics in education===
In the United States, the proportion of women represented in undergraduate [[computer science]] education and the white-collar [[information technology]] workforce peaked in the mid-1980s, and has declined ever since. In 1984, 37.1% of [[Computer Science]] degrees were awarded to women; the percentage dropped to 29.9% in 1989-1990, and 26.7% in 1997-1998.&lt;ref&gt;Camp, Tracy (2001). [http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~women/resources/aroundTheWeb/hostedPapers/Syllabus-Camp.pdf "Women in Computer Science: Reversing the Trend"]. Colorado School of Mines.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures from the [[Computing Research Association]] Taulbee Survey indicate that fewer than 12% of Computer Science bachelor's degrees were awarded to women at U.S. PhD-granting institutions in 2010-11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cra.org/uploads/documents/resources/taulbee/CS_Degree_and_Enrollment_Trends_2010-11.pdf "Computing Degree and Enrollment Trends"], 2010-2011 CRA Taulbee Survey. The Computing Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although teenage girls are now using computers and the Internet at rates similar to their male peers, they are five times less likely to consider a technology-related career or plan on taking post-secondary technology classes.&lt;ref&gt;Melkymuka, Kathleen (8 January 2001). [http://www.computerworld.com/article/2590257/it-personnel/if-girls-don-t-get-it---it-won-t-get-girls.html "If Girls Don't Get IT, IT Won't Get Girls"], Computer World.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology]] (NCWIT) reports that of the [[SAT]] takers who intend to major in computer and information sciences, the proportion of girls has steadily decreased relative to the proportion of boys, from 20 percent in 2001 to 12 percent in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Stross, Randall  (15 November 2008). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/business/16digi.html?_r=0 "What Has Driven Women Out of Computer Science?"], The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;  While this number has been decreasing, in 2001, the total number of these students (both boys and girls) reached its peak at 73,466.

According to a [[College Board]] report, in 2006 there were slightly more girls than boys amongst SAT takers that reported to having "course work or experience" in [[computer literacy]], word processing, internet activity, and creating spreadsheets/databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/cbsenior/yr2006/national-report.pdf 2006 College-Bound Seniors - Total Group Profile Report], CollegeBoard SAT.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also determined that more boys than girls (59% vs 41%) reported course work or experience with [[computer programming]], although this may likely be caused by false reporting. Of the 146,437 students (13%) who reported having ''no'' course work or experience, 61% were girls and 39% were boys.

More boys than girls take [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) Computer Science exams. According to the College Board in 2006, 2,594 girls and 12,068 boys took the AP Computer Science A exam, while 517 girls and 4,422 boys took the more advanced AP Computer Science AB exam. From 1996 to 2004, girls made up 16–17% of those taking the AP Computer Science A exam and around 10% of those taking AP Computer Science AB exam.

===Statistics in the workforce===
Women's representation in the computing and information technology workforce has been falling from a peak of 38% in the mid-1980s. From 1993 through 1999, NSF's SESTAT reported that the percentage of women working as computer/information scientists (including those who hold a bachelor's degree or higher in an S&amp;E field or have a bachelor's degree or higher and are working in an S&amp;E field) declined slightly from 33.1% to 29.6% percent while the absolute numbers increased from 170,500 to 185,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/us-workforce/ "Characteristics of Scientists and Engineers in the US"], National Science Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Catalyst in 2006 indicated that women comprise 27-29% of the computing workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Misa, ed. (2010). ''Gender Codes: Why Women Are Leaving Computing''. Wiley/IEEE Computer Society Press. pp. 32-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt; A [[National Public Radio]] report in 2013 stated that about 20% of all U.S. computer programmers are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

==Benefits of gender diversity==
A gender-diverse team is more likely to create products that meet people's requirements. When women are underrepresented, many technical decisions are based on men's experiences, opinions, and judgement, resulting in a male-slanted bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aauw.org/research/solving-the-equation/|title=Solving the Equation: The Variables for Women's Success in Engineering and Computing|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a review of research on gender-diverse teams reveals that gender-diverse teams are more productive, more creative, and more able to stay on schedule and within budget, compared to homogenous teams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/impactgenderdiversitytechbusinessperformance_print.pdf|title=What Is the Impact of Gender Diversity on Technology Business Performance?: Research Summary|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other research review suggests that the results are mixed, with many studies showing no result, non-linear results or even negative results of gender diversity on team performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/16372408/received-wisdom-relationship-between-diversity-organizational-performance|title=RECEIVED WISDOM AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIVERSITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research conducted by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] showed that companies with women in top management were more financially successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/is_there_a_payoff_from_top-team_diversity|title=Is there a payoff from top-team diversity?|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast analysis of sample major US companies showed no effect of inclusion of women (or minority members) on financial performance, these varied results give no conclusive evidence of the benefits of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8683.2010.00809.x/abstract|title=The Gender and Ethnic Diversity of US Boards and Board Committees and Firm Financial Performance|accessdate=25 August 2015 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8683.2010.00809.x|volume=18|journal=Corporate Governance: An International Review|pages=396–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Gender and Computers: Understanding the Digital Divide'' states that the lack of participation of females in computing excludes them from the "new economy", which calls for sophisticated computer skills in exchange for high salary positions.&lt;ref name="digital divide"&gt;Cooper, J.; Weaver, K. (2003). ''Gender and Computers: Understanding the Digital Divide''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-8058-4427-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors contributing to lack of female participation==

===Education===
Diminished participation by women relative to men in computer science dates from about 1984&lt;ref name=NSFstatistics&gt;{{cite web|title=TABLE 33. Computer sciences degrees awarded, by degree level and sex of recipient: 1966–2010|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf13327/pdf/tab33.pdf|publisher=NSF|accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following mass marketing of personal computers to boys as toys to play games. Fiddling with computers by boys resulted in increased interest and readiness for computer science classes by young men.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|author1=Steve Henn|title=When Women Stopped Coding|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding|accessdate=December 26, 2014|work=Morning Edition|publisher=NPR|date=October 21, 2014|quote=The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of over 7000 high school students in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]] showed that the degree of interest in the field of [[computer science]] for young women is comparably lower than that of young men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Handcock, Mark S. et al. (2004). [https://www.webcitation.org/67YOr88gp?url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/wccce/program04/Papers/mark.html "Focus on Women in Computer Science"], University of British Columbia. Archived from [http://www.cs.ubc.ca/wccce/program04/Papers/mark.html the original] on 10 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The same effect is seen in higher education; for instance, only 4% of female college freshmen expressed intention to major in computer science in the US.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt; Research has shown that some aspects about computing may discourage women. One of the biggest turn-offs is the "geek factor". High school girls often envisage a career in computing as a lifetime in an isolated cubicle writing code. The "geek factor" affects both male and female high school students, but it seems to have more of a negative effect on the female students.&lt;ref name="dean"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dean|first=Cornelia|title=Computer Science Takes Steps to Bring Women to the Fold|work=[[New York Times]]|date=17 April 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/science/17comp.html?_r=2&amp;8dpc=&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, computer programmers depicted in popular media are overwhelmingly male, contributing to an absence of role models for would-be female computer programmers.  However, in 2015, computer science has for the first time become the most popular major for female students at Stanford University.&lt;ref name=stanfordcs&gt;{{cite web|last1=McBride|first1=Sarah|title=Computer science now top major for women at Stanford University|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-women-technology-stanford-idUSKCN0S32F020151009|website=Reuters US Edition|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part to qualify for federal education funding distributed through the states, most U.S. states and districts now focus on ensuring that all students are at least "proficient" in mathematics and reading, making it difficult for teachers to focus on teaching concepts beyond the test. According to a Rand Corporation study, such a concentration on testing can cause administrators to focus resources on tested subjects at the expense of other subjects (e.g., science) or distract their attention from other needs.&lt;ref&gt;Stecher, B. M. (2002).  "Consequences of large-scale, high-stakes testing on school and classroom practice". In: Hamilton, L. S., B. M. Stecher, and S. P. Klein (Eds.). ''Making sense of test-based accountability in education''. Santa Monica, CA: Rand Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, computational thinking is unlikely to be taught either standalone or as integrated into other areas of study (e.g., mathematics, biology) anytime in the near future. The National Center for Women &amp; IT distributes free resources for increasing awareness of the need for teaching computer science in schools, including the "Talking Points" card, "Moving Beyond Computer Literacy: Why Schools Should Teach Computer Science".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncwit.org/resources.res.talking.curriculum.html Moving Beyond Computer Literacy: Why Schools Should Teach Computer Science] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529040434/http://www.ncwit.org/resources.res.talking.curriculum.html |date=May 29, 2012 }}, [[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female and male perspectives===
[[File:Not_boyfriends_computer.jpg|thumb|The sticker reads, "No, this is not my boyfriend's computer."]]
According to a 1998–2000 ethnographic study by Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], men and women viewed computers very differently. Women interviewees were more likely to state that they saw the computer as a tool for use within a larger societal and/or interdisciplinary context than did the men interviewed. On the other hand, men were more likely to express an interest in the computer as a machine.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margolis, J. et al. (1999). [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8515 ''Unlocking the Clubhouse''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713080000/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8515 |date=July 13, 2012 }}. The MIT Press. p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, women interviewed in this study perceived that many of their male peers were "geeks," with limited social skills. Females often disliked the idea that computers "become their life."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The students observed and interviewed in that study were probably not representative of students in general, since at that time, in order to be admitted to CMU Computer Science a student needed to have some programming experience. More research is needed to understand the ability to generalize Margolis' and Fisher's findings.

A two-year research initiative published in 2000 by [[AAUW]] found that "Girls approach the computer as a "tool" useful primarily for what it can do; boys more often view the computer as a "toy" and/or an extension of the self. For boys, the computer is inherently interesting. Girls are interested in its instrumental possibilities, which may include its use as an artistic medium. They express scorn toward boys who confuse "real" power and power on a screen. "I see a computer as a tool," a high school girl declares. "You [might] go play Kung Fu Fighting, but in real life you are still a stupid little person living in a suburban way."&lt;ref&gt;AAUW Educational Foundation Commission on Technology, Gender, and Teacher Education (2000). [http://history.aauw.org/files/2013/01/TechSavvy.pdf "Tech Savvy: Educating Girls in the New Computer Age"], p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed as far back as 2000 that boys and girls use computers at about the same rates, albeit for somewhat different purposes.

Nearly 1000 students in [[University of Akron]] were surveyed, and it was discovered that females hold a more negative attitude towards computers than males.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt; Another study assessed the computer-related attitude of over 300 students in [[University of Winnipeg]] and obtained similar results.&lt;ref name="digital divide" /&gt;

This is thought to contribute to the gender disparity phenomenon in computing, in particular the females' early lack of interest in the field.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt;

===Barriers to advancement===

[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10924 ''Women and Information Technology: Research on Underrepresentation''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106035820/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10924 |date=January 6, 2012 }}, Chapter 5. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has highlighted such factors as:

* Undergraduate classroom teaching in which the "weedout" practices and policies privileging competition over cooperation tend to advantage men.
* Laboratory climates in which women are seen as foreign and not belonging at best, and experience blatant hostility and sexism at worst.
* Well-meaning people who unwittingly create [[stereotype threat]] by reminding students that "women can do computing as well as men".
* Strong resistance to changing the system in which these and other subtle practices are continuously reproduced.

Just like in the pre-college situation, solutions are most often implemented outside of the mainstream (e.g., providing role models, mentoring, and women's groups), which can also create the perception among women, their male peers, and their professors that to be successful, women need "extra help" to graduate. Most people do not realize that the "extra help" is not academic, but instead access to the kind of peer networks more readily available to male students. Many women decline to participate in these extracurricular support groups because they do not want to appear deficient. In short, the conditions under which women (and underrepresented minority students) study computing are not the same as those experienced by men.

===Lack of acknowledgment and promotion of skills===
Women in technical roles often feel that the skills and feedback they bring to their jobs are not valued. According to a Catalyst report called "Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers", 65% of females in technical roles felt that those they reported to were receptive and responsive to their suggestions, as compared to 75% of women in non-technical roles.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"&gt;Foust-Cummings, Heather; Sabattini, Laura; Carter, Nancy (2008). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/36/women-in-technology-maximizing-talent-minimizing-barriers "Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers"]. Catalyst.&lt;/ref&gt; This also speaks directly to the retention of females in the industry as females will commonly leave a company when they feel that what they are offering a company is not valued.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt; The report shows the concerns felt about this by sharing the following quote from an interviewee: "I would like to be involved with more projects than I am currently involved in; I feel that I am being underutilized. I would prefer my supervisor give me an opportunity to expand my skill sets and my responsibility at work".&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt;

However, it is not enough to just acknowledge skills. Women also lack the support and advocacy needed to promote these skills.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"&gt;(2003). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/17/bit-by-bit-catalysts-guide-to-advancing-women-in-high-tech-companies "Bit by Bit: Catalyst's Guide to Advancing Women in High Tech Companies"]. Catalyst.&lt;/ref&gt; Women feel alone and at a loss because they lack role models, networks, and mentors.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"/&gt; These support systems not only help women develop talent and opportunities for career advancement, but they are also needed to promote women to more senior roles.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"/&gt; It can be understood that advocacy is a major player in the advancement of females into senior tech roles.

===Stereotyping computer scientists===
Other research examines that undergraduates' stereotype of the people in computer science and how changing this stereotype through media can influence women's interest in computer science. Through this study they concluded that the image of computer science majors that is most prevalent in popular culture and in the minds of current undergraduates is someone who is highly intelligent, primarily obsessed with computers, and socially unskilled. This image can be considered to contrast with the more people-oriented, traditionally feminine image. According to this study, students continue to generate and propagate this stereotype when asked to describe people in computer science. Based on the results of their experiment based on this idea, they took a group of women and men undergraduates and had them read a stereotypical article and a non-stereotypical article. They found that women who read the non-stereotypical article were much more interested in computer science than those who read the article with the above-mentioned stereotypical computer science student.  Overall, they concluded that the underrepresentation of women in computing not due to women's lack of interest. The study contests the perception that college major decisions are free choices, instead they discuss the implications that the major decisions are more constrained by the prevalent stereotypes. This has a negative consequence such that it prevents women from developing an interest in these technical fields. The finding suggests that the stereotypical image of the computer scientists is unattractive to women who would otherwise be interested if presented with a true representation or role model from the computer science field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = The Stereotypical Computer Scientist: Gendered Media Representations As A Barrier To Inclusion For Women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 69 | issue = 1/2| page = 58 | doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0296-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial stereotyping is also an issue, as computer scientists can often be thought of as white or Asian males, which can make it difficult for people who fall outside of those ethnicities to get hired. Non-white or Asian women may experience additional difficulty because they fail to match either half of the stereotype.&lt;ref name="Ortutay 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ortutay|first1=Barbara|title=Why is there so much attention but so little progress for diversity in tech?|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-diversity-tech-little-progress-ap-bsi-20170125-story.html|accessdate=30 Apr 2017|work=chicagotribune.com|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=25 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it has been found that a women’s race is less likely to affect the probability of her choosing computing or a related field.&lt;ref name="Trusty 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trusty|first1=Jerry|title=Effects of high school course-taking and other variables on choice of science and mathematics college majors. (Research).|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|date=2002|volume=80|issue=4|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases that subvert the stereotype of typical people in computing include the person coming from a family that is already involved in computing or a related field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kekelis|first1=Linda S.|last2=Ancheta|first2=Rebecca Wepsic|last3=Heber|first3=Etta|title=Hurdles in the pipeline: girls and technology careers.|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|date=2005|volume=26|issue=1|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, coming from a family of a higher socioeconomic status is correlated to a higher likelihood of women choosing computing or a related field.&lt;ref name="Trusty 2002" /&gt; Yet, many computing companies only search for employees from prestigious schools, which leaves fewer opportunities.&lt;ref name="Ortutay 2017" /&gt;

===Fraternity-like startup environments===
The disproportionate number of startups in the computing industry, and the disproportionate hiring of primarily young workers, have created an environment in which many firms' technical teams consist largely of workers who are recent college graduates, sometimes giving the businesses fraternity-like cultures, leading to [[Sexism in the technology industry|sexism]] that discourages female participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/09/18/heres-the-conversation-men-need-to-have-about-sexism-as-told-by-a-man/|title=Sexism In Startups: The Frank Conversation We Need To Be Having|first=Joseph|last=Steinberg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of fraternity-like environments among technology teams of startup firms has been termed ''brogrammer culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-03-01/the-rise-of-the-brogrammer|title=The Rise of the 'Brogrammer'|first=Douglas MacMillan|last=dmac1|date=2 March 2012|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological differences between genders===

==Bringing women into computing==
[[File:Computer_Repairing_Lilongwe_Malawi.jpg|thumb|Computer Repairing Lilongwe Malawi]]
The majority of data collected about women in IT has been qualitative analysis such as interviews and case studies. This data has been used to create effective programs addressing the underrepresentation of women in IT.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J W; Beise, C M; Woszczynski, A B; Myers, M E. (2003). [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-383780271.html "Diversity and the information technology workforce: Barriers and opportunities"], p.3. ''The Journal of Computer Information Systems''.&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestions for incorporating more women in IT careers include formal mentoring, ongoing training opportunities, employee referral bonuses, multicultural training for all IT employees, as well as educational programs targeting women.&lt;ref name="ramsey"&gt;Ramsey, N.; McCorduck, P.

Anita Borg Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of female college entrants expressing interest in majoring in computer science decreased in the 2000s to pre-1980's levels.&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite web|first=Andy |last=Eggers |title=Interest in computer science is volatile |url=http://www.iq.harvard.edu/blog/sss/archives/2008/11/interest_in_com.shtml |publisher=The Institute of Quantitative Social Science |date=17 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67YOs9Pdz?url=http://blogs.iq.harvard.edu/sss/archives/2008/11/interest_in_com.shtml |archivedate=10 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A research study was initialized by Allan Fisher, then Associate Dean for Undergraduate Computer Science Education at Carnegie Mellon University, and Jane Margolis, a social scientist and expert in gender equity in education, into the nature of this problem. The main issues discovered in interesting and retaining women in computer science were feelings of an experience gap, confidence doubts, interest in curriculum and pedagogy, and peer culture.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Lenore (2001). [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lblum/PAPERS/women_in_computer_science.pdf "Women in Computer Science: The Carnegie Mellon Experience"], Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science.&lt;/ref&gt; Universities across North America are changing their computer science programs to make them more appealing to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/23/358238982/to-get-women-to-work-in-computer-science-schools-get-them-to-class | title=To Get Women To Work In Computer Science, Schools Get Them To Class | publisher=NPR | date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proactive and positive exposures to early computer experiences, such as The Alice Project,&lt;ref name="Alice"&gt;[http://www.alice.org/index.php The Alice Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508000054/http://alice.org/index.php# |date=2012-05-08 }}, Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt; founded by the late [[Randy Pausch]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], are thought to be effective in terms of retention and creation of enthusiasm for women who may later consider entering the field. Institutions of higher education are also beginning to make changes regarding the process and availability of mentoring to women that are undergraduates in technical fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|author2=Kristen Moore |title=Time Talk: On Small Changes that Enact Infrastructural Mentoring for Undergraduate Women in Technical Fields|journal=Journal of Technical Writing &amp; Communication|year=2013|volume=43|issue=3|pages=333–354|doi=10.2190/TW.43.3.f|url=http://0-pq9se9hp4e.search.serialssolutions.com.maurice.bgsu.edu/?genre=article&amp;issn=00472816&amp;title=Journal+of+Technical+Writing+%26+Communication&amp;volume=43&amp;issue=3&amp;date=20130901&amp;atitle=Time+Talk%3a+On+Small+Changes+that+Enact+Infrastructural+Mentoring+for+Undergraduate+Women+in+Technical+Fields.&amp;spage=333&amp;pages=333-354&amp;sid=EBSCO:Academic+Search+Complete&amp;aulast=Sullivan%2c+Patricia|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strategy for addressing this issue has been early outreach to elementary and high-school girls. Programs like all-girl computer camps, girls' after-school computer clubs, and support groups for girls have been instilled to create more interest at a younger age.&lt;ref name="ramsey"/&gt; A specific example of this kind of program is the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] outreach program, in which a representative is sent to schools in Canada, speaking specifically to grade nine girls about the benefits of Information Technology careers. The purpose is to inform girls about the benefits and opportunities within the field of information technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cips.ca/women "Women in IT"], Canada's Association of IT Professionals.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies like [[IBM]] also encourage young women to become interested in engineering, technology and science. IBM offers EX.I.T.E. (Exploring Interests in Technology and Engineering) camps for young women from the ages of 11 to 13.

Additionally, attempts are being made to make the efforts of female computer scientists more visible through events such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women conference series which allows women in the field to meet, collaborate and present their work. In the U.S., the Association for Women in Computing was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1978. Its purpose is to provide opportunities for the professional growth of women in computing through networking, and through programs on technical and career-oriented topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awc-hq.org/home.html |title=Association for Women in Computing |publisher=Awc-hq.org |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) and other organizations have groups which promote the cause of women in computing, such as [[BCSWomen]], founded by [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], and the BCS Women's Forum. In Ontario, Canada, the '''Gr8 Designs for Gr8 Girls''' program was founded to develop grade 8 girls' interest in computer science.

=== 2000s efforts ===

====National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology====
[[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology|The National Center for Women &amp; IT]] (NCWIT) is currently one of the lead supporters of women's entry and retention in computing. Their goal is to help to create academic and work environments that are welcoming and fair for women. Their research shows that encouragement is one of the key elements to help women enter a primarily male-dominated field. They found women report more often than their male-counterpart that they entered computer science due to the influence of a teacher, family member, or friend's encouragement. Their findings conclude that support can make the difference in a woman's belief that she is competent enough to compete in computing. Thus, the NCWIT developed a program called Aspirations in Computing in order to provide girls with the necessary encouragement, a network of support, and female role models. In a survey done, nearly half of the girls polled said they would feel uncomfortable being the only girl in a group or class, one of the Aspirations main goals is to enable girls to feel less isolated in these predicaments. They have found that creating a sense of belonging or "fitting in" is fundamental for interest and current retention. The NCWIT Aspirations Award was created in order to involve women in a national competition, awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership skills, academics, and plans for graduate schooling. Due to their reach and awareness of the program, they saw a 54% increase in the girls applying in the 2013 season compared to the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;DuBow, Wendy M., et al.

====Postsecondary education organization====
Numerous postsecondary education institutions have student-run organizations that focus on the advancement of women in computer science. In addition to she++ based out of [[Stanford University]], [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT) supports a chapter of the organization called Women In Computing. The campus's chapter of the organization is composed of students, faculty and staff at RIT and they strive to support and further develop the culture of computing to women. This effort is not only focused on their campus, but in the larger community. They host events both on their campus located in Henrietta, New York, and within surrounding Rochester schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rit.edu/gccis/women-computing|title=Women in Computing|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; RIT is among a national list of schools that host a chapter of Women in Computing, which is founded in the organization [[Association for Computing Machinery|Association of Computing Machinery]]'s committee for women in computing (ACM-W).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.acm.org/|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University]] hosts the organization called Harvard Undergraduate Women in Computer Science (WiSC). The organization aims to promote women in computing across a variety of schools and industries, educate women on the profession of computer science, and provide opportunities for women in technical fields. WiCS supports the annual conference named WECode, a conference that aims to promote women's involvement in computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/business/innovation/blogs/inside-the-hive/2014/02/10/harvard-wecode-conference-welcomes-more-women-into-tech/jAlzh5KVabxMJQjhsjZa9N/blog.html|title=Harvard's WECode conference welcomes more women into tech|work=Boston.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/02/closing-the-gender-gap-in-computer-science/|title=Closing the gender gap in computer science|work=Harvard Gazette|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pacesetters====
In an effort to improve the gender composition in computing, the Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT) created a nationwide U.S. program called "Pacesetters". Through this program, twenty-four academic and corporate organizations added close to 1,000 "Net New Women" to the field of computer science by 2012. These Net New Women are women in the sciences that had not originally intended on pursuing a computer science degree. Pacesetters is the first program of its kind where different organizations come together to identify effective ways to broaden the participation of women in computer science. There are currently more than 300 corporations, academic institutions, government agencies and non-profit organizations devoted to this cause. Together they build internal teams in order to develop and fund the needed programs and share their overall results. Pacesetters organizations include some very prestigious companies such as AT&amp;T, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Georgia Tech, Pfizer, and IBM to name a few. These are a few examples of their results due to the work with Pacesetters:

== Relation to gender theory ==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Csc as Possible major for woman.jpg|thumb|Possible Majors in C.Sc]] --&gt;
There are a number of thinkers who engage with gender theories and issues related to women and technology. Such thinkers include, for example, [[Donna Haraway]], [[Sadie Plant]], Julie Wosk, [[Sally Hacker|Sally L. Hacker]], [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], [[Janet Abbate]], [[Thelma Estrin]], and Thomas J. Misa, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Erika E | title = Recognizing a Collective Inheritance through the History of Women in Computing | url = | journal = CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture | volume = 15 | issue = 1| year = 2013 | doi = 10.7771/1481-4374.1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 book titled ''Gender and Information Technology: Moving Beyond Access to Co-Create Global Partnership'' uses [[Riane Eisler]]'s [[cultural transformation theory]] to offer an interdisciplinary, social systems perspective on issues of access to technology.&lt;ref name="kirkma"&gt;Kirk, Mary (2008). ''Gender and Information Technology: Moving Beyond Access to Co-Create Global Partnership''. Hershey, PA: IGI Global. {{ISBN|978-1-59904-786-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book explores how shifting from dominator towards partnership systems—as reflected in four primary social institutions (communication, media, education, and business) - might help society move beyond the simplistic notion of access to co-create a real digital revolution worldwide.&lt;ref name="kirkma" /&gt;

A 2000 book titled ''Athena Unbound''&lt;ref name="etzkowitz"&gt;Etzkowitz, Henry; Kemelgor, Carol; Uzzi, Brian (2000). ''Athena Unbound - The advancement of women in science and technology'', [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-511-03833-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a life-course analysis (based on interviews and surveys) of women in the sciences from an early childhood interest, through university, to graduate school and finally into the academic workplace. The thesis of this book is that "women face a special series of gender related barriers to entry and success in scientific careers that persist, despite recent advances".&lt;ref name="etzkowitz" /&gt;

Computer scientist [[Karen Petrie]], from [[University of Dundee]], has developed an argument to illustrate why an attack on [[Sexism in the technology industry|sexism in computing]] is not an attack on men.&lt;ref name="petrie"&gt;{{citation|author=Petrie, Karen|title=Attack on sexism not an attack on men|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=27 November 2013|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/attack-on-sexism-not-an-attack-on-men-1-3209552}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Gent]], [[University of St Andrews]], has described this idea which is key to the argument as the "[[Petrie Multiplier]]".&lt;ref name="gent"&gt;{{citation|author=Gent, Ian|title=The Petrie Multiplier: Why an Attack on Sexism in Tech is NOT an Attack on Men|work=Ian Gent's Blog|date=13 October 2013|url=http://iangent.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/the-petrie-multiplier-why-attack-on.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to J. McGrath Cohoon, senior research scientist for the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology, there are a few possible hypotheses for why women are underrepresented in computer sciences attributed to already established theories about the influence of gender and technology stereotypes. One gender related hypothesis is that women find it more difficult than men to contribute to the intellectual life of the field in the sense that reviewers of their work are unconsciously downgraded due to their status as women or those women have lower confidence in this field that inhibits women's willingness to publicly present their technical findings. Due to this barrier of women as second-class citizens in the computing world, it creates an environment that is not accessible to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 2011 | title = Gender And Computing Conference Papers | url = | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 54 | issue = 8| pages = 72–80 | doi=10.1145/1978542.1978561}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the Psychology of Women Quarterly backs this hypothesis up by concluding that even the enduring effect of single brief exposures to stereotypical role models leaves a strong mark. Their findings reported that the most important factor in recruiting women to the computer science field is that women meet with a potential role model, regardless of gender of that role model, that conveys to the woman a sense of belonging in the field. This finding suggests that support and encouragement are the two most important aspects that can influence women participation in computing. In order for women to be more receptive to the field is if the environment became a more welcoming place by their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | last2 = Drury | first2 = Benjamin J. | last3 = Vichayapai | first3 = Marissa | year = 2013 | title = Enduring Influence Of Stereotypical Computer Science Role Models on Women's Academic Aspirations | url = | journal = Psychology Of Women Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 72–79 | doi=10.1177/0361684312459328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cordelia Fine]] in her book [[Delusions of Gender]] argues that apparent differences are due to constant exposure to societal beliefs of gender difference. Fine also argues that "...while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don't yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Forum {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-1/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-2/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument for why women are less prevalent in computer science is the ill-defined nature of computing according to Paul De Palma. In his article Why Women Avoid Computer Science, he postulates that women find careers in computing unattractive. He finds that among the many reasons offered, he believes the nature of computing is what drives them away. He claims that young men who are drawn to computer science and engineering are those that like to tinker, those who like to use tools to create and dismantle objects. He further claims that computing is not a true profession, that traditional career paths such as law, business, and medicine are more certain and profitable on average than computing. He compares it to using a computer, computers nowadays do not come with lengthy manuals on the inner workings of the modern day computer, in fact our tools are always more complicated than their what they are used for, thus the tinkering nature of men, the drive born from gender stereotyping from birth, has made men successful in this field for they are more inclined to spend endless hours of tinkering with software and hardware. His claim revolves around the focus that boys and girls fall into gender stereotypes, girls who usually are given dolls and boys who are given trucks and toy tool boxes. He claims that these gender roles placed on children is one of the primary causes for the gender gap seen in computer science. He postulates that if we were to see more girls playing with trucks and other "boy-related" toys that perhaps we would see an increase in this tinkering nature and therefore more participation of women in the computer science field.&lt;ref&gt;De Palma, Paul.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14088">The first '''Golden Age of Science Fiction''', often recognized in the United States as the period from 1938 to 1946,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, Peter (1981) ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', Granada, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; was an era during which the [[science fiction]] genre gained wide public attention and many classic science fiction stories were published.  In the [[history of science fiction]], the Golden Age follows the "[[History of US science fiction and fantasy magazines to 1950|pulp era]]" of the 1920s and 1930s, and precedes [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave science fiction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. The 1950s are a transitional period in this scheme; however, [[Robert Silverberg]], who came of age in the 1950s, saw that decade as the true Golden Age.&lt;ref name=silverberg/&gt;

According to historian [[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Roberts]], "the phrase ''Golden Age'' valorises a particular sort of writing: '[[Hard science fiction|Hard&amp;nbsp;SF]]', linear narratives, heroes solving problems or countering threats in a space-opera or technological-adventure idiom."&lt;ref name=roberts195&gt;Roberts, Adam ''The History of Science Fiction'', p 195, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006.  {{ISBN|0-333-97022-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From Gernsback to Campbell==

One leading influence on the creation of the Golden age was [[John W. Campbell]], who became legendary in the genre as an editor and publisher of science fiction magazines, including ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', to such an extent that [[Isaac Asimov]] stated that "...in the 1940s, (Campbell) dominated the field to the point where to many seemed ''all'' of science fiction."&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac (1989), ''The Mammoth Book of Golden Age Science Fiction'', Carroll &amp; Graf Published Inc., p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Under Campbell's editorship, science fiction developed more realism and psychological depth to characterization than it exhibited in the [[Hugo Gernsback|Gernsbackian]] "super science" era. The focus shifted from the [[Gadget|gizmo]] itself to the characters using the gizmo.

Most fans agree that the Golden Age began around 1938-39,&lt;ref name=roberts195/&gt; slightly later than the [[Golden Age of Detective Fiction]], another pulp-based genre.{{r|budrys196510}} The July 1939 issue of ''Astounding Science Fiction'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?STNDNJLYB41981|title=Astounding Science Fiction, July 1939|work=isfdb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes cited as the start of the Golden Age. It included "[[Black Destroyer]]", the first published story by [[A. E. van Vogt]], and the first appearance of [[Isaac Asimov]] ("[[Trends (short story)|Trends]]") in the magazine.&lt;ref name="earlyyears79_82"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/78/mode/2up |title=The early Asimov; or, Eleven years of trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1972 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City NY |pages=79-82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction writer [[John C. Wright (author)|John C. Wright]] said of Van Vogt's story, "This one started it all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icshi.net/sevagram/interviews/wright.php|title=Null-A Nitty-Gritty: An Interview with John C. Wright - Sevagram|author=Isaac Walwyn|work=icshi.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The August issue contained the first published story by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] ("[[Life-Line]]").{{r|earlyyears79_82}}

[[Robert Silverberg]] in a 2010 essay argued that the true Golden Age was the 1950s, saying that “Golden Age” of the 1940s was a kind of "false dawn". "Until the decade of the fifties", Silverberg wrote, "there was essentially no market for science fiction books at all"; the audience supported only a few special interest small presses. The 1950s saw "a spectacular outpouring of stories and novels that quickly surpassed both in quantity and quality the considerable achievement of the Campbellian golden age",&lt;ref name=silverberg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loa.org/sciencefiction/why_silverberg.jsp |title=Science Fiction in the Fifties: The Real Golden Age |author=[[Robert Silverberg]] |date=2010 |publisher=[[Library of America]] |accessdate=September 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825082507/http://www.loa.org/sciencefiction/why_silverberg.jsp |archivedate=August 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as mainstream companies like [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] and [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] displaced specialty publishers like [[Arkham House]] and [[Gnome Press]].&lt;ref name="budrys196510"&gt;{{Cite magazine

==Developments in the genre==

Many of the most enduring science fiction [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] were established in Golden Age literature. [[Space opera]] came to prominence with the works of [[E. E. "Doc" Smith]]; [[Isaac Asimov]] established the canonical [[Three Laws of Robotics]] beginning with the 1941 short story "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]"; the same period saw the writing of genre classics such as the Asimov's [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] and Smith's ''[[Lensman]]'' series. Another frequent characteristic of Golden Age science fiction is the celebration of scientific achievement and the [[sense of wonder]]; Asimov's short story "[[Nightfall (Asimov)|Nightfall]]" exemplifies this, as in a single night a planet's civilization is overwhelmed by the revelation of the vastness of the universe. [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s 1950s novels, such as ''[[The Puppet Masters]]'', ''[[Double Star]]'', and ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', express the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] ideology that runs through much of Golden Age science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Adam ''The History of Science Fiction'', pp. 196-203, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006.  {{ISBN|0-333-97022-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Algis Budrys]] in 1965 wrote of the "recurrent strain in 'Golden Age' science fiction of the 1940's—the implication that sheer technological accomplishment would solve all the problems, hooray, and that all the problems were what they seemed to be on the surface".&lt;ref name="budrys196508"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Golden Age also saw the re-emergence of the religious or spiritual themes&amp;mdash;central to so much proto-science fiction before the pulp era&amp;mdash;that Hugo Gernsback had tried to eliminate in his vision of "scientifiction".  Among the most significant such Golden Age narratives are Bradbury's ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'', Clarke's ''[[Childhood's End]]'', Blish's ''[[A Case of Conscience]]'', and Miller's ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Adam ''The History of Science Fiction'', pp. 210-218, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006.  {{ISBN|0-333-97022-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==

As a phenomenon that affected the psyches of a great many adolescents during [[World War II]] and the ensuing [[Cold War]], science fiction's Golden Age has left a lasting impression upon society.  The beginning of the Golden Age coincided with the first [[Worldcon]] in 1939 and, especially for its most involved fans, science fiction was becoming a powerful social force.  The genre, particularly during its Golden Age, had significant, if somewhat indirect, effects upon leaders in the [[military]], [[information technology]], [[Hollywood]] and science itself, especially [[biotechnology]] and the [[pharmaceutical]] industry.

==Prominent Golden Age authors==

{{div col end}}

==End of the Golden Age==
Asimov said that "The [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropping of the atom bomb in 1945]] made science fiction respectable" to the general public.&lt;ref name=nightfall93&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/nightfallotherst00asim#page/92/mode/2up|title=Nightfall, and other stories|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|date=1969|publisher=Doubleday|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled in 1969 "I'll never forget the shock that rumbled through the entire world of science fiction fandom when ... Heinlein broke the 'slicks' barrier by having [[The Green Hills of Earth|an undiluted science fiction story of his]] published in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''".&lt;ref name=nightfall328&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/nightfallotherst00asim#page/328/mode/2up|title=Nightfall, and other stories|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|date=1969|publisher=Doubleday|pages=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large, mainstream companies' entry into the science fiction book market around 1950 was similar to how they published crime fiction during World War II; authors no longer could only publish through magazines.&lt;ref name="budrys196510"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov said, however, that{{r|nightfall93}}

{{quote|I myself was ambivalent ... There was a tendency for the new reality to nail the science fiction writer to the ground. Prior to 1945, science fiction had been wild and free. All its motifs and plot varieties remained in the realm of fantasy and we could do as we pleased. After 1945, there came the increasing need to talk about the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|AEC]] and to mold all the infinite scope of our thoughts to the small bit of them that had become real.}}

He continued, "In fact, there was the birth of something I called 'tomorrow fiction'; the science fiction story that was no more new than tomorrow's headlines. Believe me, there can be nothing duller than tomorrow's headlines in science fiction", citing [[Nevil Shute]]'s ''[[On the Beach (novel)|On the Beach]]'' as example.{{r|nightfall93}}

It is harder to specify the end of the Golden Age of Science Fiction than its beginning, but several factors changed the market for magazine science fiction in the mid- and late 1950s. Most important was the rapid contraction of the pulp market: ''[[Fantastic Adventures]]'' and ''Famous Fantastic Mysteries'' folded in 1953, ''[[Planet Stories]], [[Startling Stories]], [[Thrilling Wonder Stories]]'' and ''Beyond'' in 1955, ''[[Other Worlds (magazine)|Other Worlds]]'' and ''Science Fiction Quarterly'' in 1957, ''Imagination'', ''Imaginative Tales'', and ''Infinity'' in 1958. In October 1957, the successful launch of the Soviet satellite [[Sputnik 1]] narrowed the gap between the real world and the world of science fiction, sending the west into a space race with the east. Asimov shifted to writing nonfiction he hoped would attract young minds to science, while Robert A. Heinlein became more dogmatic in expressing political and social views in his fiction. Emerging British writers like [[Brian W. Aldiss]] and [[J. G. Ballard]] cultivated a more literary style, indicating the direction other writers would soon pursue. Women writers, such as [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Judith Merril]], emerged. When the leading Golden Age magazine, ''Astounding Stories'', changed its title to [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]] in 1960, it was clear the Golden Age of Science Fiction was over.

'''Haiphong Sign Language''' is the [[deaf-community sign language]] of the city of [[Haiphong]] in Vietnam. It is about 50% cognate with the other sign languages of Vietnam, and has been less influence than them by the [[French Sign Language]] once taught in Vietnamese schools for the deaf. It is each cognate with the languages of the [[Old Chiangmai–Bangkok Sign Language family]] of Thailand; the deaf-community sign langes of Vietnam, Thailand and Laos may be genealogically related, or there may be a history of population movement that has cause them to have words in common.

An '''indigenous language''' or '''autochthonous language''' is a [[language]] that is native to a region and spoken by [[indigenous people]]. This language would be from a linguistically distinct [[community]] that has been settled in the area for many generations. Indigenous languages are not necessarily [[national language]]s, and the reverse is also true.

Many indigenous peoples worldwide have [[endangered language|stopped passing on]] their ancestral languages to the next generation, and have instead [[language shift|adopted]] the [[majority language]] as part of their [[acculturation]] into the [[majority culture]]. Furthermore, many indigenous languages have been subject to [[language death|linguicide]] (language killing).&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 55-56 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil‘ad]], Shakuto-Neoh, Shiori &amp; Quer, Giovanni Matteo (2014), [http://www.professorzuckermann.com/#!native-tongue-title/cufd Native Tongue Title: Proposed Compensation for the Loss of Aboriginal Languages], ''Australian Aboriginal Studies'' 2014/1: 55-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing their vulnerability, the [[United Nations]] proclaimed 2019 the International Year of Indigenous Languages, "to draw attention to the critical loss of indigenous languages and the urgent need to preserve, revitalize and promote indigenous languages."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, 71st session, Third Committee, 16 November 2016 [https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/C.3/71/L.17/Rev.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
Many indigenous languages are disappearing as there are no longer any young people left to speak those languages, so their remaining speakers are dying out.&lt;ref&gt;Glavin, Maywa and Montenegro, Terry. "''In Defense of Difference''." 7 October 2008. Seed Magazine. 29 January 2009 [http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2008/10/in_defense_of_difference_1.php].&lt;/ref&gt;
In North America, since 1600 at least 52 [[Native American languages]] have disappeared. Globally, there may be more than 7,000 languages that exist in the world today, though many of them have not been recorded because they belong to tribes in rural areas of the world or are not easily accessible. It is estimated that 6,809 "living" languages exist in the world today, with 90% having fewer than 100,000 speakers. This means that roughly 6,100 languages are facing a risk of eventual extinction. Some languages are very close to disappearing. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Forty six languages are known to have just one native speaker while 357 languages have fewer than 50 speakers. Rare languages are more likely to show evidence of decline than more common ones.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Steve. "Alarm Raised on World's Disappearing Languages." 15 May 2003. Common Dreams. Org. 21 February 2009 [https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/alarm-raised-on-worlds-disappearing-languages-104768.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Oklahoma]] provides the backdrop for an example of language loss in the developed world. It boasts the highest density of indigenous languages in the United States. This includes languages originally spoken in the region, as well as those of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes from other areas that were [[Indian removal|forcibly relocated onto reservations]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages. "''Disappearing Languages - Enduring Voices-Documenting the Planet's Endangered Languages''." 2009. National Geographic. 19 February 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708132439/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |archivedate=2010-07-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government drove the [[Yuchi]] from [[Tennessee]] to Oklahoma in the early 19th century. Until the early 20th century, most Yuchi tribe members spoke the language fluently. Then, government boarding schools severely punished American Indian students who were overheard speaking their own language. To avoid beatings and other punishments, Yuchi, and other Indian children abandoned their native languages in favor of English.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2005, only five elderly members of the Yuchi tribe were fluent in the language. These remaining speakers spoke Yuchi fluently before they went to school and have maintained the language despite strong pressure to abandon it.&lt;ref&gt;Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages. "Disappearing Languages - Enduring Voices-Documenting the Planet's Endangered Languages." 2009. ''National Geographic''. 19 February 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708132439/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |archivedate=2010-07-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This situation was not limited to Oklahoma.  In the Northwest Pacific plateau there are no speakers left of the indigenous tribal languages from that area, all the way to [[British Columbia]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Oregon's [[Siletz Reservation|Siletz reservation]], established in 1855, was home to the endangered language [[Tolowa language|Siletz Dee-ni]]. The reservation held members of 27 different Indian bands speaking many languages. In order to communicate, people adopted [[Chinook Jargon]], a [[pidgin]] or hybrid language. Between the use of [[Chinook Jargon]] and the increased presence of English, the number of speakers of indigenous languages dwindled.&lt;ref&gt;Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages. "Disappearing Languages - Enduring Voices-Documenting the Planet's Endangered Languages." 2009. ''National Geographic''. 19 February 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708132439/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |archivedate=2010-07-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other tribes of Native Americans were also forced into government schools and reservations. They were also treated badly if they did not become "civilized". This meant they were to go to Christian churches and speak English. They were forced to give up their tribal religious beliefs and languages. Now, these Native Americans are trying to regain some of their lost heritage. They gather at "[[Pow-wow]]" to share culture, stories, remedies, dances, music, rhythms, recipes and heritage with anyone who wants to learn them.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In January 2008, in Anchorage, Alaska, friends and relatives gathered to bid their last farewell to 89 year old Marie Smith Jones, a beloved matriarch of her community. "As they bid her farewell to her, they also bid farewell to the [[Eyak language]] as Marie was the last fluent speaker of the language."&lt;ref&gt;Glavin, Maywa and Montenegro, Terry. "In Defense of Difference." 7 October 2008. ''Seed Magazine''. 29 January 2009 2009[http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2008/10/in_defense_of_difference_1.php].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Isle of Man]], following the decline in the use of [[Manx language|Manx]] during the 19th century, {{lang|gv|Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh}} (The Manx Language Society) was founded in 1899. By the middle of the 20th century only a few elderly [[native speaker]]s remained (the last of them, [[Ned Maddrell]], died on 27 December 1974), but by then a scholarly [[Language revitalization|revival]] had begun to spread and many people had learned Manx as a second language. The revival of Manx has been aided by the recording work done in the 20th century by researchers.

==Learning==
Hundreds of indigenous languages around the world are taught by traditional means, including vocabulary, grammar, readings and recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Courses|url=http://lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=11 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 6,000 others can be learned to some extent by listening to recordings made for other purposes, such as religious texts, where translations are available in more widely known languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Countries of the World|url=http://globalrecordings.net/en/countries|publisher=Global Recordings Network|accessdate=11 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GEOGRAPHIC LANGUAGE MUSEUM|url=http://foreignlanguageexpertise.com/museum2.html|publisher=ForeignLanguageExpertise.com|accessdate=11 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Treasure language"==
The term "treasure language" was proposed by the [[Rama people]] of Nicaragua as an alternative to [[Heritage language]], Indigenous language and "ethnic language", names that are considered pejorative in the local context.&lt;ref name="Grinevald"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grinevald |first1=Colette |last2=Pivot |first2= Bénédicte |editor-last1=Jones |editor-first1=Mari |editor-last2=Ogilvie |editor-first2=Sarah |title=Keeping Languages Alive: Documentation, Pedagogy and Revitalization |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2013 |chapter=On the revitalization of a ‘treasure language’: The Rama Language Project of Nicaragua |chapterurl=https://www.academia.edu/5387106/The_Revitalization_of_a_Treasure_Language_the_Rama_Language_Project_of_Nicaragua |doi=10.1017/CBO9781139245890.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is now also used in the context of public storytelling events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Languages Treasured but Not Lost  |url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/languages-treasured-but-not-lost/Content?oid=4679610 |work=East Bay Express |location=Oakland |date=2016-02-17 |access-date=2017-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "treasure language" references the desire of speakers to sustain the use of their mother tongue into the future:
{{Quote|text=[The] notion of treasure fit the idea of something that had been buried and almost lost, but was being rediscovered and now shown and shared. And the word treasure also evoked the notion of something belonging exclusively to the Rama people, who now attributed it real value and had become eager and proud of being able to show it to others.&lt;ref name="Grinevald"/&gt;}}

Accordingly, the term may be considered to be distinct from [[Endangered language]] for which objective criteria are available, or [[Heritage language]] which describes an end-state for a language where individuals are more fluent in a dominant language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Hale |editor-first1=Kenneth |editor-last2=Hinton |editor-first2=Leanne |title=The Green Book of Language Revitalization in Practice |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |date=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Jewish Virtual Library relies on history books, scientific studies, various encyclopedias, archives, polls, maps, and material from museums for its bibliography, as well as Wikipedia articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bookstore|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biblio.html|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the JVL, it received permission to use materials from the Library of Congress, from the American Jewish Historical Society, the Anti-Defamation League, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel), The Prime Minister’s Office, Rabbi Joseph Telushkin and other resources&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitchell G. Bard]] is the encyclopedia's Executive Director.&lt;ref name="AVI CHAI 2013"&gt;{{cite web | title=Jewish Virtual Library Website » AVI CHAI | website=AVI CHAI | date=June 3, 2013 | url=http://avichai.org/program-listings/jewish-virtual-library-website/ | access-date=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library has 13 wings: Anti-Semitism, History, Myths and Facts, Women, The Holocaust, Travel, Maps, Politics, Biography, Israel, Israel Education, Religion, Judaic Treasures of the Library of Congress, and Vital Statistics and Reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Virtual Library Website|url=http://avichai.org/program-listings/jewish-virtual-library-website/|work=[[AVI CHAI Foundation]]|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The JVL hosts more than 60,000 articles and nearly 10,000 photographs and maps related to Jewish history, Israel, Israel–United States relations, the Holocaust, antisemitism and Judaism, as well as various statistics, information about politics, biographies, travel guides, and a section [[Jewish women]] throughout history.

John Jaeger, in an article published by the [[Association of College and Research Libraries]], said of the JVL: "This library, once it is entered, is more like a living encyclopedia than it is anything else.

'''Hungaria''' is a [[national symbol]] of [[Hungary]], an [[personification|allegory]] and a portrayal of the [[Hungary|nation]].

The Lady of Hungaria is displayed in many places in Hungary and across its borders. She symbolizes the liberty of Hungary.

==History==
After the decades of the lost [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|revolution and independence war of 1848/49]] the [[Habsburg Empire|Habsburg monarchy]] went into absolutism. In the 1860s, monuments were raised to commemorate the lost liberty. One of these depictions was the Lady of Hungaria. She is often symbolised as a woman with a helmet or the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] on her head, and a sword and shield in her hands. At [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] where the 13 martyrs of independence war were executed, a huge monument was raised in 1889. The central figurine is Hungaria.

After the [[Treaty of Trianon]] and the loss of lives after [[World War I]], the goddess became the symbol for hope and the resurrection of Hungary.

{{About|the musical work|the former French commune|Le Désert|other uses|Désert (disambiguation){{!}}Désert}}
'''''Le désert''''' is an "ode-symphonie" in three parts by the French composer [[Félicien David]] with words by fellow [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonien]] Auguste Colin, written after the composer’s stay in Egypt and the Holy Land.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Macdonald H. Félicien David. In : ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was first performed to great acclaim at the [[Paris Conservatoire]] on 8 December 1844, conducted by [[Théophile Tilmant]], and taken up at the [[Théâtre-Italien]] and by [[Berlioz]].&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald H, ed. ''Selected letters of Berlioz'' (translated by Roger Nichols). Faber &amp; Faber, London and Boston, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; At its premiere the work was played alongside two other  Saint-Simonien works also by David; ''Chant du Soir'' and ''Le Sommeil de Paris''.&lt;ref name="Locke"&gt;Locke, Ralph P. ''Music, Musicians and Saint-Simonians.'' The University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1986, p209-210.&lt;/ref&gt; David had needed to borrow 1,200 francs to pay for the orchestra and hall.&lt;ref&gt;Barzun J. ''Berlioz and his century – an introduction to the age of romanticism.'' Meridian Books, New York, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; David's friends and colleagues [[Charles Duveyrier]] (half brother of [[Mélesville]]) and [[Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin]] took it upon themselves to challenge a contract David had innocently signed with Escudier which had given the publisher the rights to all David's works for ever, for only 1,200 francs.&lt;ref name="Locke"/&gt; ''Le désert'' was successful from its premiere and influenced the conception of works based around the orient by many other French composers. David later wrote other works in similar vein, such as his operas ''La perle du Brésil'' and ''[[Lalla-Roukh]]''.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

The work is scored for speaker, tenor solo, male chorus and orchestra. It consists of several vocal and orchestral movements, each introduced by a recitation. The different sections of the ode move from the song of the desert, arrival of a caravan, [[Simoom|storm in the desert]], calm after the storm and the caravan continuing its journey, the [[star of Venus]], a hymn to the night, dances, sunrise, the song of the [[muezzin]], departure of the caravan and song to Allah.

''Le désert'' was planned to be staged as an opera at the [[Théâtre Lyrique]] to accompany ''[[La sonnambula]]'' in 1867, but these plans did not come to fruition. However, [[Jules Pasdeloup|Pasdeloup]] in his short-lived tenure at the Théâtre Lyrique presented seven well-received concert performances in 1869-70, as well as concerts of David's symphonic ode ''Christophe Colomb''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Joseph Walsh (Wexford)|Walsh T J.]] ''Second Empire Opera: The Théâtre Lyrique Paris 1851–1870.'' John Calder (Publishers Ltd), London, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] used the melody of the ‘chant du muezzin’ in his ballet music for the Paris premiere of ''[[Otello]]'' in 1894. Budden also finds the influence of ''Le désert'' in the dawn movement of the prologue of ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'' (1846) which Verdi had heard in Milan in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian Budden|Budden J]]. ''Verdi (the Master Musicians).'' JM Dent and Sons Ltd, London &amp; Melbourne, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of Bizet's ''[[Les pecheurs de perles]]'', also show the influence of ''Le désert'', for instance in the Act 1 finale (« O dieu Brahma ») and Act 2 « De mon amie ».&lt;ref&gt;Lacombe H. ''The Keys to French Opera in the Nineteenth Century.'' University of California Press, Berkeley, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] wrote music for a 'parodie' of the work entitled ''Citrouillard au désert'', first performed at the house of the Countess Bertin de Vaux at the end of February 1846. A simple bourgeois is bored in the desert, and diverted by several choruses and dances. At the break of dawn a long crescendo leads to the tune '[[Au clair de la lune]]'. The work was also performed at the [[Opéra-Comique]] on 27 March 1846.&lt;ref name="Yon"&gt;Yon, Jean-Claude. ''Jacques Offenbach.'' Éditions Gallimard, Paris, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

David's work is mentioned in chapter XV of [[Jules Verne]]'s 1886 novel ''[[Robur the Conqueror]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Robur the Conqueror/Chapter XV|Wikisource text of Robur the Conqueror]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Gide]] was fond of this "likeable" piece as a teenager, as reported in his memoir ''[[Si le grain ne meurt]]'', chapter 6. [[Henri Vieuxtemps]] made a transcription of the tenor aria ''"Hymne à la nuit"'' as ''La Nuit'' for viola and piano.

In modern houses, a linen press is often a built-in cabinet near bedroom or bathroom, for easy access to fresh bed sheets and towels.

Analogous terms are ''laundry cupboard'' or ''linen cupboard''.

In Ireland the term ''hot press'' describes an [[Airing_cupboard#Airing_cupboard|airing cupboard]] used for storing linen.

'''The Nehru Centre, London''' is a cultural centre located at the [[South Audley Street]], London. Its goal is to promote cultural exchange between India and the United Kingdom.

There are twelve observed '''[[New York State]] [[Public holidays in the United States|holiday]]s''' for state employees.  Under the Attendance Rules, a holiday that falls on a Sunday is observed on the following Monday.  Lincoln's Birthday and Election Day are deemed floating holidays and can optionally be observed on a later date.  A holiday is observed by employees scheduled to work that day; it is not available as a regular or floating holiday for other employees.

==Additional New York City holidays==
In addition to the official New York state holidays, New York City schools also receive the following holidays:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/nyc-public-school-kids-new-holidays-article-1.1601237|title=NYC Public Schools Kids New Holidays}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Lunar New Year]] ([[Chinese New Year]])
* [[Rosh Hashanah]]
* [[Yom Kippur]]
* [[Eid al-Fitr]]
* [[Eid al-Adha]]
* [[Diwali]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yonkerstribune.com/2017/04/six-new-york-state-school-districts-declare-holiday-on-hindu-festival-diwali|title=Six New York State School Districts Declare Holiday on Hindu Festival Diwali - Yonkers Tribune.|date=April 12, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasoning behind the additional holidays is said to be to recognize the [[cultural diversity]] of the city where "... homes where over 185 languages are spoken and more than 42 percent of the students come from homes where English is not the primary language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/nyc-schools-get-islamic-lunar-holidays-n23071|title=NYC Schools to Get Islamic, Lunar Holidays Off}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Obsessive–compulsive disorder''' ('''OCD''') is a [[mental disorder]] where people feel the need to check things repeatedly, perform [[compulsive behavior|certain routines repeatedly]] (called "rituals"), or have [[intrusive thoughts|certain thoughts repeatedly]] (called "obsessions").&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; People are unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Common activities include [[hand washing]], counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Some may have difficulty throwing things out.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; These activities occur to such a degree that the person's daily life is negatively affected.&lt;ref name=NIH2015&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/index.shtml|website=U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)|author=The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)|date=January 2016|accessdate=24 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723194024/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/index.shtml|archivedate=23 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often takes up more than an hour a day.&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|pages=237–242|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; The condition is associated with [[tic disorders|tics]], [[anxiety disorder]], and an increased risk of [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ang2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angelakis|first1=I|last2=Gooding|first2=P|last3=Tarrier|first3=N|last4=Panagioti|first4=M|title=Suicidality in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): A systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|publisher=[[Pergamon Press]]|location=Oxford, England|date=25 March 2015|volume=39|pages=1–15|pmid=25875222|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2015.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause is unknown.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; There appear to be some [[genetics|genetic]] components with both [[identical twins]] more often affected than both non-identical twins.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Risk factors include a history of [[child abuse]] or other [[stress (psychological)|stress]]-inducing event.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Some cases have been documented to occur following [[infection]]s.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and requires ruling out other drug related or medical causes.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Rating scales such as the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS) can be used to assess the severity.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenske JN, Schwenk TL | title = Obsessive compulsive disorder: diagnosis and management | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–45 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19621834 | doi =  | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0801/p239.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140512222223/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0801/p239.html | archivedate = 12 May 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other disorders with similar symptoms include anxiety disorder, [[major depressive disorder]], [[eating disorders]], [[tic disorders]], and [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and prognosis --&gt;
Treatment involves [[psychotherapy|counseling]], such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), and sometimes [[antidepressants]] such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) or [[clomipramine]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ve2014 /&gt; CBT for OCD involves increasing exposure to what causes the problems while not allowing the repetitive behavior to occur.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014&gt;{{cite journal | author = Grant JE | title = Clinical practice: Obsessive-compulsive disorder. | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 371 | issue = 7 | pages = 646–53 | date = 14 August 2014 | pmid = 25119610 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMcp1402176}}&lt;/ref&gt; While clomipramine appears to work as well as SSRIs, it has greater side effects so is typically reserved as a second line treatment.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt; [[Atypical antipsychotic]]s may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in treatment-resistant cases but are also associated with an increased risk of side effects.&lt;ref name=Ve2014&gt;{{cite journal |last=Veale |first= D|last2= Miles|first2=S |last3=Smallcombe |first3= N|last4=Ghezai |first4=H |last5=Goldacre |first5=B|last6=Hodsoll |first6=J |date=29 November 2014 |title=Atypical antipsychotic augmentation in SSRI treatment refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis. |journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume= 14|issue= |pages=317 |doi=10.1186/s12888-014-0317-5 |pmid=25432131 |pmc=4262998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dec2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Decloedt EH, Stein DJ | title = Current trends in drug treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | volume = 6 | issue = |pages = 233–42 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20520787 | pmc = 2877605 | doi = 10.2147/NDT.S3149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without treatment, the condition often lasts decades.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, Society and Culture --&gt;
Obsessive–compulsive disorder affects about 2.3% of people at some point in their life.&lt;ref name=Good2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodman|first1=WK|last2=Grice|first2=DE|last3=Lapidus|first3=KA|last4=Coffey|first4=BJ|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=The Psychiatric Clinics of North America|date=September 2014|volume=37|issue=3|pages=257–67|pmid=25150561|doi=10.1016/j.psc.2014.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates during a given year are about 1.2%, and it occurs worldwide.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; It is unusual for symptoms to begin after the age of 35, and half of people develop problems before 20.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Males and females are affected about equally.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; In English, the phrase ''obsessive–compulsive'' is often used in an informal manner unrelated to OCD to describe someone who is excessively meticulous, [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionistic]], absorbed, or otherwise fixated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bynum|first1=W.F.|last2=Porter|first2=Roy|last3=Shepherd|first3=Michael|title=The anatomy of madness : essays in the history of psychiatry|date=1985|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-32382-6|pages=166–187|chapter=Obsessional Disorders: A Conceptual History.

== Signs and symptoms ==
OCD can present with a wide variety of symptoms. Certain groups of symptoms usually occur together. These groups are sometimes viewed as dimensions or clusters that may reflect an underlying process. The standard assessment tool for OCD, the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS), has 13 predefined categories of symptoms. These symptoms fit into three to five groupings.&lt;ref name="Leckman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leckman|first1=JF|last2=Bloch|first2=MH|last3=King|first3=RA|title=Symptom dimensions and subtypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a developmental perspective.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2009|volume=11|issue=1|pages=21–33|pmid=19432385|pmc=3181902}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta analysis|meta analytic]] review of symptom structures found a four factor structure (grouping) to be most reliable.  The observed groups included a "symmetry factor", a "forbidden thoughts factor", a "cleaning factor", and a "hoarding factor".  The "symmetry factor" correlated highly with obsessions related to ordering, counting, and symmetry, as well as repeating compulsions.  The "forbidden thoughts factor" correlated highly with intrusive and distressing thoughts of a violent, religious, or sexual nature. The "cleaning factor" correlated highly with obsessions about contamination and compulsions related to cleaning. The "hoarding factor" only involved hoarding related obsessions and compulsions, and was identified as being distinct from other symptom groupings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloch|first1=MH|last2=Landeros-Weisenberger|first2=A|last3=Rosario|first3=MC|last4=Pittenger|first4=C|last5=Leckman|first5=JF|title=Meta-analysis of the symptom structure of obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=December 2008|volume=165|issue=12|pages=1532–42|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08020320|pmid=18923068|pmc=3972003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While OCD has been considered a homogenous disorder from a neuropsychological perspective, many of the putative neuropsychological deficits may be due to comorbid disorders.  Furthermore, some subtypes have been associated with improvement in performance on certain tasks such as pattern recognition (washing subtype) and spatial working memory (obsessive thought subtype). Subgroups have also been distinguished by neuroimaging findings and treatment response.  Neuroimaging studies on this have been too few, and the subtypes examined have differed too much to draw any conclusions.  On the other hand, subtype dependent treatment response has been studied, and the hoarding subtype has consistently responded least to treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=D|last2=Abramowitz|first2=JS|last3=Calamari|first3=JE|last4=Kyrios|first4=M|last5=Radomsky|first5=A|last6=Sookman|first6=D|last7=Taylor|first7=S|last8=Wilhelm|first8=S|title=A critical evaluation of obsessive-compulsive disorder subtypes: symptoms versus mechanisms.|journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|date=July 2004|volume=24|issue=3|pages=283–313|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2004.04.003|pmid=15245833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obsessions are thoughts that recur and persist, despite efforts to ignore or confront them.&lt;ref name=Review10&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Y|last1=Markarian|first2=MJ|last2=Larson|first3=MA|last3=Aldea|first4=SA|last4=Baldwin|first5=D|last5=Good|first6=A|last6=Berkeljon|first7=TK|last7=Murphy|first8=EA|last8=Storch|first9=D|last9=McKay| title = Multiple pathways to functional impairment in obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = [[Clinical Psychology Review]] |volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 78–88 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19853982 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with OCD frequently perform tasks, or [[Compulsive behavior|compulsions]], to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. Within and among individuals, the initial obsessions, or intrusive thoughts, vary in their clarity and vividness. A relatively vague obsession could involve a general sense of disarray or tension accompanied by a belief that life cannot proceed as normal while the imbalance remains. A more intense obsession could be a preoccupation with the thought or image of someone close to them dying{{sfn|Baer|2001|pp=33, 78}}{{sfn|Baer|2001|p=xiv}} or intrusions related to "[[Relationship obsessive–compulsive disorder|relationship rightness]]".&lt;ref name = Doron2013&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G|last1=Doron|first2=O|last2=Szepsenwol|first3=E|last3=Karp|first4=N|last4=Gal| title = Obsessing About Intimate-Relationships: Testing the Double Relationship-Vulnerability Hypothesis | journal = [[Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry]] |volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 433–440 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23792752 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbtep.2013.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other obsessions concern the possibility that someone or something other than oneself—such as God, the Devil, or disease—will harm either the person with OCD or the people or things that the person cares about. Other individuals with OCD may experience the sensation of invisible protrusions emanating from their bodies, or have the feeling that inanimate objects are ensouled.&lt;ref name=Mash&gt;{{cite book|first1=Eric J.|last1=Mash|first2=David A.|last2=Wolfe|title=Abnormal child psychology|edition=3|date=2005|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation|Thomson Wadsworth]]|location=[[Belmont, California]]|page=197|isbn= 978-1305105423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people with OCD experience [[sexual obsessions]] that may involve intrusive thoughts or images of "kissing, touching, fondling, [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]], intercourse, [[incest]], and [[rape]]" with "strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals, and religious figures", and can include "[[heterosexual]] or [[homosexual]] content" with persons of any age.&lt;ref name="Osgood"&gt;{{cite web|first=Deborah|last=Osgood-Hynes|url=http://www.raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf|title=Thinking Bad Thoughts|publisher=MGH/McLean OCD Institute|location=Belmont, Massachusetts|accessdate=December 30, 2006|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115230001/http://raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf |archive-date=November 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, some disquieting sexual thoughts at times are normal, but people with OCD may attach extraordinary significance to the thoughts. For example, obsessive fears about [[sexual orientation]] can appear to the person with OCD, and even to those around them, as a crisis of [[sexual identity]].&lt;ref name="ItMoved"&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven|last=Phillipson|url=http://www.ocdonline.com/articlephillipson7.php|title=I Think It Moved|website=OCDOnline.com|publisher=Center for Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy|location=New York City|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218215734/http://www.ocdonline.com/articlephillipson7.php |archive-date=December 18, 2008|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sexfears"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark-Ameen|last=Johnson|url=http://www.brainphysics.com/yourenotgay.php|title=I'm Gay and You're Not : Understanding Homosexuality Fears|website=brainphysics.com|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505042912/http://www.brainphysics.com/yourenotgay.php |archive-date=5 May 2009|accessdate=14 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the troubling thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or self-loathing.&lt;ref name="Osgood" /&gt;

Most people with OCD understand that their notions do not correspond with reality; however, they feel that they must act as though their notions are correct. For example, an individual who engages in [[compulsive hoarding]] might be inclined to treat inorganic matter as if it had the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level. There is a debate as to whether or not hoarding should be considered with other OCD symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=DL|last2=Timpano|first2=KR|last3=Wheaton|first3=MG|last4=Greenberg|first4=BD|last5=Miguel|first5=EC|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder and its related disorders: a reappraisal of obsessive-compulsive spectrum concepts.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=12|issue=2|pages=131–48|pmid=20623919|pmc=3181955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCD sometimes manifests without overt compulsions, referred to as Primarily Obsessional OCD. OCD without overt compulsions could, by one estimate, characterize as many as 50 percent to 60 percent of OCD cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Myrna M.|last1=Weisman|title = The cross national epidemiology of obsessive–compulsive disorder | journal = New Developments in Obsessive-Compulsive and Spectrum Disorders|  volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 6–9 |date = May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compulsions ===
{{Main|Compulsive behavior}}

[[File:Derma me.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Dermatillomania|Skin-picking disorder]]]]

Some people with OCD perform compulsive rituals because they inexplicably feel they have to, while others act compulsively so as to mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so [[idiosyncratic]] or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive [[excoriation disorder|skin picking]], [[trichotillomania|hair-pulling]], [[nail biting]], and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Some individuals with OCD are aware that their behaviors are not rational, but feel compelled to follow through with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5|url=http://www.dsm5.org/documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|page=7|year=2013|accessdate=12 Apr 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204551/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common compulsions include hand washing, cleaning, checking things (e.g., locks on doors), repeating actions (e.g., turning on and off switches), ordering items in a certain way, and requesting reassurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Boyd MA |title=Psychiatric Nursing |journal=Issues in Mental Health Nursing |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=13–26 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3UUuXw7ISM0C&amp;pg=PA418|isbn=978-0-397-55178-1|pmid=8119793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsions are different from [[tics]] (such as touching, tapping, rubbing, or blinking)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Storch|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder in youth with and without a chronic tic disorder|url=http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/17345600|journal=Depression and Anxiety|year=2008|volume=25|issue=9|pages=761–767|doi=10.1002/da.20304|pmid=17345600|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[stereotypic movement disorder|stereotyped movements]] (such as head banging, body rocking, or self-biting), which usually aren't as complex and aren't precipitated by obsessions.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between compulsions and complex tics.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; About 10% to 40% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Conelea|year=2014|title=Tic-related obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): phenomenology and treatment outcome in the Pediatric OCD Treatment Study II|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=53|issue=12|pages=1308–16|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2014.09.014|pmid=25457929|display-authors=etal|pmc=4254546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People rely on compulsions as an escape from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the intrusive thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill, and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on the context in which the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/obsessive-compulsive-disorder.|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, (2005) |accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it can be hard for the person to fulfil their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with [[antibacterial soap]] and hot water can make their skin red and raw with [[dermatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |title=Hygiene of the Skin: When Is Clean Too Clean? Subtopic: "Skin Barrier Properties and Effect of Hand Hygiene Practices", Paragraph 5. |accessdate=26 March 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421205614/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |archivedate=21 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with OCD can use rationalizations to explain their behavior; however, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior but to each instance individually. For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is ''still'' not sure and deems it is ''still'' better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.

=== Insight ===
The DSM-V contains three specifiers for the level of insight in OCD.  Good or fair insight is characterized by the acknowledgment that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are or may not be true.  Poor insight is characterized by the belief that obsessive-complsive beliefs are probably true.  Absence of insight make obsessive-compulsive beliefs [[delusion]]al thoughts, and occurs in about 4% of people with OCD.&lt;ref name="Sadock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=P|last2=Sadock|first2=B|last3=Sadock|first3=V|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|publisher=LWW|location=95218|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|edition=10th|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overvalued ideas ===
Some people with OCD exhibit what is known as ''overvalued ideas''. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do [[Exposure and response prevention|ERP therapy]] on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially. There are severe cases in which the person has an unshakeable belief in the context of OCD that is difficult to differentiate from [[psychosis|psychotic disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Dwyer, Anne-Marie Carter, Obsessive–compulsive disorder and delusions revisited, The British Journal of Psychiatry (2000) 176: 281–284&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive performance ===
A 2013 meta-analysis reported that people with OCD to have mild but wide-ranging cognitive deficits; significantly regarding [[spatial memory]], to a lesser extent with [[verbal memory]], [[Verbal fluency test|fluency]], executive function, and processing speed, while auditory attention was not significantly affected.&lt;ref name=shin&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shin NY, Lee TY, Kim E, Kwon JS | title = Cognitive functioning in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Medicine | pages = 1–10 | date = 19 July 2013 | pmid = 23866289 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291713001803 | volume=44| issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People with OCD show impairment in formulating an organizational strategy for coding information, set-shifting, and motor and cognitive inhibition.&lt;ref name="Aydin"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Çetinay Aydın P, Güleç Öyekçin D | title = Cognitive functions in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder | journal = Turk Psikiyatri Dergisi (Turkish Journal of Psychiatry) | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 266–74 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24310094 | doi=10.5080/u7172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
{{Main|Cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder}}
The cause is unknown.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Both environmental and genetic factors are believed to play a role. Risk factors include a history of [[child abuse]] or other [[stress (psychological)|stress]]-inducing event.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

=== Genetics ===
There appear to be some [[genetics|genetic]] components with [[identical twins]] more often affected than non-identical twins.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Further, individuals with OCD are more likely to have first-degree family members exhibiting the same disorders than do matched controls. In cases where OCD develops during childhood, there is a much stronger familial link in the disorder than cases in which OCD develops later in adulthood. In general, genetic factors account for 45–65% of the variability in OCD symptoms in children diagnosed with the disorder.&lt;ref name="pmid19665647"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abramowitz JS, Taylor S, McKay D | title = Obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Lancet | volume = 374 | issue = 9688 | pages = 491–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19665647 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60240-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study found evidence supporting the possibility of a heritable risk for OCD.&lt;ref name="Menzies et al, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Menzies L, Achard S, Chamberlain SR, Fineberg N, Chen CH, del Campo N, Sahakian BJ, Robbins TW, Bullmore E | title = Neurocognitive endophenotypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Brain | volume = 130 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 3223–36 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17855376 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awm205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuroimaging ===
[[File:OCD - Obsessive–compulsive disorder.jpg|thumb|Some parts of the brain showing abnormal activity in OCD.]]
Functional neuroimaging during symptom provocation has observed abnormal activity in the [[orbitofrontal cortex]], left [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], right [[premotor cortex]], left superior [[Superior temporal gyrus|temporal gyrus]], [[globus pallidus externus]], [[hippocampus]] and right [[uncus]]. Weaker foci of abnormal activity were found in the left [[caudate nucleus|caudate]], [[posterior cingulate cortex]] and [[superior parietal lobule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rotge|first1=Jean-Yves|last2=Guehl|first2=Dominique|last3=Dilharreguy|first3=Bixente|last4=Cuny|first4=Emmanuel|last5=Tignol|first5=Jean|last6=Bioulac|first6=Bernard|last7=Allard|first7=Michele|last8=Burbaud|first8=Pierre|last9=Aouizerate|first9=Bruno|title=Provocation of obsessive–compulsive symptoms: a quantitative voxel-based meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies|journal=Journal of Psychiatry &amp; Neuroscience : JPN|date=3 March 2017|volume=33|issue=5|pages=405–412|pmc=2527721|issn=1180-4882|pmid=18787662}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an older meta analysis of functional neuroimaging in OCD reported the only consistent functional neuroimaging findings have been increased activity in the orbital gyrus and head of the caudate nucleus, while ACC activation abnormalities were too inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whiteside|first1=Stephen P.|last2=Port|first2=John D.|last3=Abramowitz|first3=Jonathan S.|title=A meta–analysis of functional neuroimaging in obsessive–compulsive disorder|journal=Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging|volume=132|issue=1|pages=69–79|doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2004.07.001|pmid=15546704|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta analysis comparing affective and non affective tasks observed differences with controls in regions implicated in salience, habit, goal ditected behavior, self-referential thinking and cognitive control.

=== Cognitive models ===

Generally two categories of models for OCD have been postulated, the first involving deficits in executive function, and the second involving deficits in modulatory control.  The first category of executive dysfunction is based on the observed structural and functional abnormalities in the dlPFC, striatum, and thalamus.  The second category involving dysfunctional modulatory control primarily relies on observed functional and structural differences in the ACC, mPFC and OFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedlander|first1=L|last2=Desrocher|first2=M|title=Neuroimaging studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults and children.|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=January 2006|volume=26|issue=1|pages=32–49|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2005.06.010|pmid=16242823}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=ER|last2=Taylor|first2=SF|title=Cognitive neuroscience of obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=The Psychiatric Clinics of North America|date=September 2014|volume=37|issue=3|pages=337–52|doi=10.1016/j.psc.2014.05.004|pmid=25150566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One proposed model suggests that dysfunction in the [[orbitofrontal cortex|OFC]] leads to improper valuation of behaviors and decreased behavioral control, while the observed alterations in amygdala activations leads to exaggerated fears and representations of negative stimuli.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=J|last2=Ahmari|first2=SE|title=A Framework for Understanding the Emerging Role of Corticolimbic-Ventral Striatal Networks in OCD-Associated Repetitive Behaviors.|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|date=2015|volume=9|pages=171|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00171|pmid=26733823|pmc=4681810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the heterogeneity of OCD symptoms, studies differentiating between symptoms have been performed. Symptom specific neuroimaging abnormalities include the hyperactivity of caudate and ACC in checking rituals, while finding increased activity of cortical and cerebellar regions in contamination related symptoms. Neuroimaging differentiating between content of intrusive thoughts have found differences between aggressive as opposed to taboo thoughts, finding increased connectivity of the amygdala, ventral striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in aggressive symptoms, while observing increased connectivity between the ventral striatum and insula in sexual/religious intrusive thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakao|first1=Tomohiro|last2=Okada|first2=Kayo|last3=Kanba|first3=Shigenobu|title=Neurobiological model of obsessive-compulsive disorder: Evidence from recent neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|date=August 2014|volume=68|issue=8|pages=587–605|doi=10.1111/pcn.12195|pmid=24762196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model proposes that affective dysregulation links excessive reliance on habit based action selection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barahona-Corrêa|first1=JB|last2=Camacho|first2=M|last3=Castro-Rodrigues|first3=P|last4=Costa|first4=R|last5=Oliveira-Maia|first5=AJ|title=From Thought to Action: How the Interplay Between Neuroscience and Phenomenology Changed Our Understanding of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2015|volume=6|pages=1798|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01798|pmid=26635696|pmc=4655583}}&lt;/ref&gt; with compulsions.  This is supported by the observation that those with OCD demonstrate decreased activation of the [[ventral striatum]] when anticipating monetary  reward, as well as increase functional connectivity between the VS and the OFC.  Furthermore, those with OCD demonstrate reduced performance in pavlovian fear extinction tasks, hyper responsiveness in the amygdala to fearful stimuli, and hypo-resonsiveness in the amygdala when exposed to positively valanced stimuli.  Stimulation of the [[nucleus accumbens]] has also been observed to effectively alleviate both obsessions and compulsions, supporting the role of affective dysregulation in generating both.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

=== Neurobiological ===

From the observation of the efficacy of antidepressants in OCD, a serotonin hypothesis of OCD has been formulated. Studies of peripheral markers of serotonin, as well as challenges with proserotonergic compounds have yielded inconsistent results, including evidence pointing towards basal hyperactivity of serotonergic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Kenneth L|title=Neuropsychopharmacology : the fifth generation of progress : an official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology|date=2002|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-0-7817-2837-9|pages=1609–1610|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serotonin receptor and transporter binding studies have yielded conflicting results, including higher and lower serotonin receptor [[5-HT2A]] and [[serotonin transporter]] binding potentials that were normalized by treatment with SSRIs. Despite inconsistencies in the types of abnormalities found, evidence points towards dysfunction of serotonergic systems in OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Muller |first1=Christian P |last2=Jacobs |first2=Barry L |author3=A Dijk|author4=A Klompmakers|author5=D Denys|title=Handbook of the behavioral neurobiology of serotonin|date=2009|publisher=Academic|location=London|isbn=978-0-12-374634-4|pages=547–558|edition=1st|chapter=4.4 The Serotonergic System in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orbitofrontal cortex]] overactivity is attenuated in people who have successfully responded to [[SSRI]] medication, a result believed to be caused by increased stimulation of [[serotonin]] receptors [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT2A]] and [[serotonin receptor|5-HT2C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim KW, Lee DY | title = Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Associated With a Left Orbitofrontal Infarct | journal = Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 88–89 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11884667 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.14.1.88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex relationship between dopamine and OCD has been observed. Although antipsychotics, which act by antagonizing dopamine receptors may improve some cases of OCD, they frequently exacerbate others.  Antipsychotics, in the low doses used to treat OCD, may actually increased the release of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, through inhibiting autoreceptors. Further complicating things is the efficacy of amphetamines, decreased [[dopamine transporter]] activity observed in OCD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=Jesse|last2=Ahmari|first2=Susanne E.|title=A Framework for Understanding the Emerging Role of Corticolimbic-Ventral Striatal Networks in OCD-Associated Repetitive Behaviors|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|date=17 December 2015|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00171|pmc=4681810|issn=1662-5137|pmid=26733823}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low levels of D2 binding in the striatum.&lt;ref name="glutamate" /&gt;  Furthermore, increased dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens after deep brain stimulation correlates with improvement in symptoms, pointing to reduced dopamine release in the striatum playing a role in generating symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graat|first1=I|last2=Figee|first2=M|last3=Denys|first3=D|editor1-last=Pittinger|editor1-first=C|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Phenomenology, Pathophysiology and Treatment|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter=Neurotransmitter Dysregulation in OCD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abnormalities in glutaminergic neurotransmission have implicated in OCD.

Formal diagnosis may be performed by a psychologist, psychiatrist, clinical social worker, or other licensed mental health professional. To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have obsessions, compulsions, or both, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize [[Clinical significance|clinically significant]] obsessions and compulsions. Such obsessions, the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the [[Normality (behavior)|normal]] range of worries about conventional problems.&lt;ref name="Quick"&gt;''Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR''. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A person may attempt to ignore or [[Thought suppression|suppress]] such obsessions, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the obsessions as idiosyncratic or irrational.

Compulsions become clinically significant when a person feels driven to perform them in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, and when the person consequently feels or causes significant distress. Therefore, while many people who do not suffer from OCD may perform actions often associated with OCD (such as ordering items in a pantry by height), the distinction with clinically significant OCD lies in the fact that the person who suffers from OCD ''must'' perform these actions, otherwise they will experience significant psychological distress. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these activities are not logically or practically connected to the issue, or they are excessive. In addition, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive.

Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day) or cause impairment in social, occupational or scholastic functioning.&lt;ref name="Quick" /&gt; It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment for OCD. In addition to the peron's estimate of the time spent each day harboring obsessive-compulsive thoughts or behaviors, concrete tools can be used to gauge the people’s condition. This may be done with rating scales, such as the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS). With measurements like these, psychiatric consultation can be more appropriately determined because it has been standardized.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009" /&gt;

OCD is sometimes placed in a group of disorders called the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Starcevic|first1=V|last2=Janca|first2=A|title=Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders: still in search of the concept-affirming boundaries.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=January 2011|volume=24|issue=1|pages=55–60|pmid=20827198|doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e32833f3b58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differential diagnosis ===
OCD is often confused with the separate condition [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD). OCD is [[egodystonic]], meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's [[self-concept]].&lt;ref name="Aardema, F. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Aardema&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aardema F., O'Connor |year = 2003 | title = Seeing white bears that are not there: Inference processes in obsessions | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 23–37 | doi=10.1891/jcop.17.1.23.58270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because ego dystonic disorders go against a person's self-concept, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is [[egosyntonic]]—marked by the person's acceptance that the characteristics and behaviours displayed as a result are compatible with their [[self-image]], or are otherwise appropriate, correct or reasonable.

As a result, people with OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational, are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them.&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;Carter, K. "Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder." PSYC 210 lecture: Oxford College of Emory University. Oxford, GA. 11 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast people with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise, and they tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

== Management ==
A form of psychotherapy called "[[cognitive behavioral therapy]]" (CBT) and [[psychotropic medication]]s are first-line treatments for OCD.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NICE2005 /&gt; Other forms of psychotherapy, such as [[psychodynamic]] and [[psychoanalysis]] may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but in 2007 the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) noted a lack of [[Scientific control|controlled studies]] showing their effectiveness "in dealing with the core symptoms of OCD".&lt;ref name="APAguidelines"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koran LM, Hanna GL, Hollander E, Nestadt G, Simpson HB | title = Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 164 | issue = 7 Suppl | pages = 5–53 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17849776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to [[social stigma|stigma]] associated with OCD.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Therapy ===

[[File:Pennsylvania Capitol front door keyhole.jpg|thumb|One exposure and ritual prevention activity would be to check the lock only once, and then leave]]

The specific technique used in CBT is called [[exposure and response prevention]] (ERP) which involves teaching the person to deliberately come into contact with the situations that trigger the obsessive thoughts and fears ("exposure"), without carrying out the usual compulsive acts associated with the obsession ("response prevention"), thus gradually learning to tolerate the discomfort and anxiety associated with not performing the ritualistic behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly "contaminated" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a "contaminated" location, such as a school.) That is the "exposure". The "ritual prevention" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly [[habituation|habituates]] to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level drops considerably; they can then progress to touching something more "contaminated" or not checking the lock at all—again, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"&gt;Huppert &amp; Roth: (2003) Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Exposure and Response Prevention. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 4 (1),'' 66 – 70 [http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323025324/http://baojournal.com/ |date=23 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERP has a strong evidence base, and it is considered the most effective treatment for OCD.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com" /&gt; However, this claim was doubted by some researchers in 2000 who criticized the quality of many studies.&lt;ref name="pmid10910778"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Klein DF | title = Flawed meta-analyses comparing psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 157 | issue = 8 | pages = 1204–11 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10910778 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.8.1204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has generally been accepted that psychotherapy, in combination with psychiatric medication, is more effective than either option alone.

=== Medication ===

[[File:Anafranil Japan.jpg|thumb|A blister pack of [[clomipramine]] under the brand name ''Anafranil'']]

The medications most frequently used are the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs).&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt; [[Clomipramine]], a medication belonging to the class of [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, appears to work as well as SSRIs but has a higher rate of side effects.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt;

SSRIs are a second line treatment of adult obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) with mild functional impairment and as first line treatment for those with moderate or severe impairment. In children, SSRIs can be considered as a second line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects.&lt;ref name=NICE2005&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg31/resources/treating-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-ocd-and-body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd-in-adults-children-and-young-people-194882077|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder: Core interventions in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder|author=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)|series=Information about NICE Clinical Guideline 31|publisher=UK National Health Service (NHS)|date=November 2005|accessdate=24 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112001813/https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg31/resources/treating-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-ocd-and-body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd-in-adults-children-and-young-people-194882077|archivedate=12 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSRIs are efficacious in the treatment of OCD; people treated with SSRIs are about twice as likely to respond to treatment as those treated with placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Arroll B, Elley CR, Fishman T, Goodyear-Smith FA, Kenealy T, Blashki G, Kerse N, Macgillivray S | title = Antidepressants versus placebo for depression in primary care | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = |issue = 3 | pages = CD007954 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19588448 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007954 | url = https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/publications/85b92403-d474-4e5a-b606-65f7e0f86575|editor1-last = Arroll | editor1-first = Bruce }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825+ |title=Review Finds SSRIs Modestly Effective in Short-Term Treatment of OCD|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413110435/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825 |archivedate=13 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficacy has been demonstrated both in short-term (6–24&amp;nbsp;weeks) treatment trials and in discontinuation trials with durations of 28–52&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fineberg NA, Brown A, Reghunandanan S, Pampaloni I | title = Evidence-based pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 1173–91 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22226028 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145711001829 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019839s070,020990s032lbl.pdf |title=Sertraline prescribing information |accessdate=30 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616011817/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019839s070%2C020990s032lbl.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apotex.com/us/en/products/downloads/pil/paxil_irtb_ins.pdf |title=Paroxetine prescribing information |accessdate=30 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219055046/https://www.apotex.com/us/en/products/downloads/pil/paxil_irtb_ins.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the National Institute of Clinical and Health Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommended [[antipsychotic]]s for OCD that does not improve with SSRI treatment.&lt;ref name="Ve2014" /&gt; For OCD there is tentative evidence for [[risperidone]] and insufficient evidence for [[olanzapine]].  [[Quetiapine]] is no better than placebo with regard to primary outcomes, but small effects were found in terms of YBOCS score.  The efficacy of quetiapine and olanzapine are limited by the insufficient number of studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Komossa|first=K|author2=Depping, AM|author3= Meyer, M|author4= Kissling, W|author5= Leucht, S|title=Second-generation antipsychotics for obsessive compulsive disorder.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 Dec 2010|issue=12|pages=CD008141|pmid=21154394|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008141.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review article found two studies that indicated that [[aripiprazole]] was "effective in the short-term" and found that "[t]here was a small effect-size for risperidone or anti-psychotics in general in the short-term"; however, the study authors found "no evidence for the effectiveness of quetiapine or olanzapine in comparison to placebo."&lt;ref name="Ve2014" /&gt; While quetiapine may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in treatment-resistant OCD, these drugs are often poorly tolerated, and have metabolic side effects that limit their use. None of the atypical antipsychotics appear to be useful when used alone.&lt;ref name=Dec2010 /&gt; Another review reported that no evidence supports the use of first generation antipsychotics in OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pignon|first1=B|last2=Tezenas du Montcel|first2=C|last3=Carton|first3=L|last4=Pelissolo|first4=A|title=The Place of Antipsychotics in the Therapy of Anxiety Disorders and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders.|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|date=7 November 2017|volume=19|issue=12|pages=103|doi=10.1007/s11920-017-0847-x|pmid=29110139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A guideline by the APA suggested that [[dextroamphetamine]] may be considered by itself after more well supported treatments have been tried.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koran|first1=Lorrin|last2=Hanna|first2=Gregory|last3=Hollander|first3=Eric|last4=Nestadt|first4=Gerald|last5=Helen|first5=Simpson|title=Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|url=http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/ocd.pdf|website=American Psychiatric Association|publisher=American Psychiatric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Procedures ===
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) has been found to have effectiveness in some severe and refractory cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cybulska Eva M | year = 2006 | title = Obsessive Compulsive disorder, the brain and electroconvulsive therapy | url = | journal = British Journal of Hospital Medicine | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 77–82 | doi=10.12968/hmed.2006.67.2.20466| pmid = 16498907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[psychosurgery|Surgery]] may be used as a last resort in people who do not improve with other treatments. In this procedure, a surgical [[lesion]] is made in an area of the brain (the [[cingulate cortex]]). In one study, 30% of participants benefitted significantly from this procedure.&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;Barlow, D. H. and V. M. Durand. ''Essentials of Abnormal Psychology''. California: Thomson Wadsworth, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deep-brain stimulation]] and [[vagus nerve stimulation]] are possible surgical options that do not require destruction of [[brain tissue]]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration approved deep-brain stimulation for the treatment of OCD under a humanitarian device exemption requiring that the procedure be performed only in a hospital with specialist qualifications to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barlas S |title=FDA Approves Pioneering Treatment for Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=26 |issue=4 |date=8 April 2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ocd/article/10168/1399208 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710101738/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ocd/article/10168/1399208 |archivedate=10 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the person has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive [[cognitive–behavioral therapy]] with exposure and ritual/response prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainphysics.com/surgery.php Surgical Procedures for Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725094926/http://brainphysics.com/surgery.php |date=25 July 2008 }}, by M. Jahn and M. Williams, Ph.D,. BrainPhysics OCD Resource, Accessed 6 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in the United Kingdom, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive–behavioral therapist has been carried out.

=== Children ===
Therapeutic treatment may be effective in reducing ritual behaviors of OCD for children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Donohue William |author2=Ferguson Kyle E | year = 2006 | title = Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology and Behavior Analysis | url = | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 335–347 | doi=10.1037/h0100155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the treatment of adults with OCD, CBT stands as an effective and validated first line of treatment of OCD in children.&lt;ref name=Freeman2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=J|last2=Garcia|first2=A|last3=Frank|first3=H|last4=Benito|first4=K|last5=Conelea|first5=C|last6=Walther|first6=M|last7=Edmunds|first7=J|title=Evidence base update for psychosocial treatments for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder|journal=Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology|date=2014|volume=43|issue=1|pages=7–26|pmid=23746138|doi=10.1080/15374416.2013.804386|pmc=3815743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family involvement, in the form of behavioral observations and reports, is a key component to the success of such treatments.&lt;ref name="Rapoport, J. E. 1989"&gt;Rapoport, J. E. (1989). Obsessive-compulsive Disorder In Children &amp; Adolescents. Washington: American Psychiatric Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Parental interventions also provide positive reinforcement for a child who exhibits appropriate behaviors as alternatives to compulsive responses. In a recent meta-analysis of evidenced-based treatment of OCD in children, family-focused individual CBT was labeled as "probably efficacious", establishing it as one of the leading psychosocial treatments for youth with OCD.&lt;ref name=Freeman2014 /&gt; After one or two years of therapy, in which a child learns the nature of his or her obsession and acquires strategies for coping, that child may acquire a larger circle of friends, exhibit less shyness, and become less self-critical.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, P. L. (1973). Obsessive Children: A Sociopsychiatric Study. Philadelphia: Brunner / Mazel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the causes of OCD in younger age groups range from brain abnormalities to psychological preoccupations, life stress such as bullying and traumatic familial deaths may also contribute to childhood cases of OCD, and acknowledging these stressors can play a role in treating the disorder.&lt;ref name="pmid19378573"&gt;{{cite journal | author = D'Alessandro TM | title = Factors influencing the onset of childhood obsessive compulsive disorder | journal = Pediatr Nurs | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19378573 | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obsessive–compulsive disorder affects about 2.3% of people at some point in their life.&lt;ref name=Good2014 /&gt; Rates during a given year are about 1.2% and it occurs worldwide.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; It is unusual for symptoms to begin after the age of thirty five and half of people develop problems before twenty.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Males and females are affected about equally.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;

=== Associated conditions ===
People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, as well as or instead of OCD, such as the aforementioned obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen YW, Dilsaver SC | title = Comorbidity for obsessive-compulsive disorder in bipolar and unipolar disorders | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 59 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 57–64 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8771221 | doi = 10.1016/0165-1781(95)02752-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[bulimia nervosa]], [[Tourette syndrome]], [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[dermatillomania]] (compulsive skin picking), [[body dysmorphic disorder]] and [[trichotillomania]] (hair pulling). More than 50 percent of people experience suicidal tendencies, and 15 percent have attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009" /&gt; Depression, anxiety and prior suicide attempts increase the risk of future suicide attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angelakis|first1=I|last2=Gooding|first2=P|last3=Tarrier|first3=N|last4=Panagioti|first4=M|title=Suicidality in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=July 2015|volume=39|pages=1–15|pmid=25875222|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2015.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with OCD have also been found to be affected by [[delayed sleep phase syndrome]] at a substantially higher rate than the general public.&lt;ref name='Turner 2007'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turner J, Drummond LM, Mukhopadhyay S, Ghodse H, White S, Pillay A, Fineberg NA | title = A prospective study of delayed sleep phase syndrome in patients with severe resistant obsessive–compulsive disorder | journal = World Psychiatry | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 108–111 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 18235868 | pmc = 2219909 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, severe OCD symptoms are consistently associated with greater sleep disturbance. Reduced total sleep time and sleep efficiency have been observed in people with OCD, with delayed sleep onset and offset and an increased prevalence of delayed sleep phase disorder.&lt;ref name="Paterson2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paterson JL, Reynolds AC, Ferguson SA, Dawson D | title = Sleep and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) | journal = Sleep Medicine Reviews | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 465–74 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23499210 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2012.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorally, there is some research demonstrating a link between [[drug addiction]] and the disorder as well. For example, there is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with the heightened levels of [[anxiety]]), but drug addiction among people with OCD may serve as a type of [[compulsive behavior]] and not just as a coping mechanism. [[Clinical depression|Depression]] is also extremely prevalent among people with OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other [[anxiety disorder]]) may feel depressed because of an "out of control" type of feeling.&lt;ref name="comorbidity"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mineka S, Watson D, Clark LA | title = Comorbidity of anxiety and unipolar mood disorders | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = |pages = 377–412 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9496627 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone exhibiting OCD signs does not necessarily have OCD. Behaviors that present as (or seem to be) obsessive or compulsive can also be found in a number of other conditions as well, including [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder|obsessive–compulsive ''personality'' disorder]] (OCPD), [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders#Obsessive-compulsive disorder|autism spectrum disorder]], disorders where [[perseveration]] is a possible feature ([[ADHD]], [[PTSD]], bodily disorders or habit problems)&lt;ref name="differential"&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Differential Diagnoses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917123925/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential |date=17 September 2012 }} – 2012&lt;/ref&gt; or sub-clinically.

Some with OCD present with features typically associated with Tourette's syndrome, such as compulsions that may appear to resemble motor tics; this has been termed "tic-related OCD" or "Tourettic OCD".&lt;ref name="10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21.1.59"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mansueto CS, Keuler DJ | title = Tic or compulsion?: it's Tourettic OCD. | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 784–99 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16046664 | doi = 10.1177/0145445505279261 | journal=Behavior Modification}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD and T"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocfoundation.org/eo_ts.aspx |title=OCD and Tourette Syndrome: Re-examining the Relationship |publisher=International OCD Foundation |accessdate=30 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101085624/http://www.ocfoundation.org/eo_ts.aspx |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A myth propagated by Sigmund Freud regarding above-average intelligence in OCD was recently refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11065-017-9358-0 | pmid=28864868 | title=Meta-Analysis of Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder | year=2017 | journal=Neuropsychology Review | volume=28 | issue=1 | pages=111–120 | author=Abramovitch Amitai, Anholt Gideon, Raveh-Gottfried Sagi, Hamo Naama, Abramowitz Jonathan S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCD frequently co-occurs with both [[bipolar disorder]] and [[major depressive disorder]].  Between 60–80% of those with OCD experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime. Comorbidity rates have been reported at between 19–90% due to methodological differences.  Between 9–35% of those with bipolar disorder also have OCD, compared to the 1–2% in the general population. Around 50% of those with OCD experience cyclothymic traits or hypomanic episodes.  OCD is also associated with anxiety disorders.  Lifetime comorbidity for OCD has been reported at 22% for [[specific phobia]], 18% for [[social anxiety disorder]], 12% for panic disorder, and 30% for [[generalized anxiety disorder]].  The comorbidity rate for OCD and ADHD has been reported as high as 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pallanti|first1=S|last2=Grassi|first2=G|last3=Sarrecchia|first3=ED|last4=Cantisani|first4=A|last5=Pellegrini|first5=M|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder comorbidity: clinical assessment and therapeutic implications.|journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry|date=2011|volume=2|pages=70|doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2011.00070|pmid=22203806|pmc=3243905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
Quality of life is reduced across all domains in OCD. While psychological or pharmacological treatment can lead to a reduction of OCD symptoms and an increase in QoL, symptoms may persist at moderate levels even following adequate treatment courses, and completely symptom-free periods are uncommon.&lt;ref name="pmid15533282"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eddy KT, Dutra L, Bradley R, Westen D | title = A multidimensional meta-analysis of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1011–30 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15533282 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2004.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Subramaniam|first1=M|last2=Soh|first2=P|last3=Vaingankar|first3=JA|last4=Picco|first4=L|last5=Chong|first5=SA|title=Quality of life in obsessive-compulsive disorder: impact of the disorder and of treatment.|journal=CNS Drugs|date=May 2013|volume=27|issue=5|pages=367–83|doi=10.1007/s40263-013-0056-z|pmid=23580175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In pediatric OCD, around 40% still have the disorder in adulthood, and around 40% qualify for remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boileau|first1=B|title=A review of obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2011|volume=13|issue=4|pages=401–11|pmid=22275846|pmc=3263388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the seventh century AD, [[John Climacus]] records an instance of a young monk plagued by constant and overwhelming "temptations to blasphemy" consulting an older monk,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Osborn|first=Ian|date=1998|title=Tormenting Thoughts and Secret Rituals: The Hidden Epidemic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WVgTAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=Obsessive+Compulsive+Disorder+in+antiquity#v=onepage&amp;q=Obsessive%20Compulsive%20Disorder%20in%20antiquity&amp;f=false|location=New York City, New York|publisher=Dell Publishing|isbn=978-0-440-50847-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|212}} who told him, "My son, I take upon myself all the sins which these temptations have led you, or may lead you, to commit. All I require of you is that for the future you pay no attention to them whatosever."&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|212}} ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'', a Christian mystical text from the late fourteenth century, recommends dealing with recurring obsessions by first attempting to ignore them,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} and, if that fails, "cower under them like a poor wretch and a coward overcome in battle, and reckon it to be a waste of your time for you to strive any longer against them",&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} a technique now known as "[[emotional flooding]]".&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}}

From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual or other obsessive thoughts were [[spiritual possession|possessed]] by the [[Satan|Devil]].&lt;ref name="Aardema, F. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aardema F., O'Connor |year = 2007 | title = The menace within: obsessions and the self | url = | journal = International Journal of Cognitive Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 182–197 | doi=10.1891/088983907781494573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the "evil" from the "possessed" person through [[exorcism]].&lt;ref name="Jenike"&gt;M.

The English term obsessive-compulsive comes from the translated term used to describe the first conceptions of OCD by [[Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal|Carl Westphal]], "zwangsvorstellung".  Westphal's description went on to influence [[Pierre Janet]] who further documented features of OCD.&lt;ref name="Sadock" /&gt;  In the early 1910s, [[Sigmund Freud]] attributed obsessive–compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts that manifest as symptoms.&lt;ref name="Jenike" /&gt; Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of "touching phobia" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an "external prohibition" against this type of touching. However, this "prohibition does not succeed in abolishing" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and "force it into the unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Freud S |authorlink=Sigmund Freud |others=trans.

=== Notable cases ===
[[John Bunyan]] (1628–1688), the author of ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', displayed symptoms of OCD (which had not yet been named).&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} During the most severe period of his condition, he would mutter the same phrase over and over again to himself while rocking back and forth.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} He later described his obsessions in his autobiography ''[[Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners]]'',&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} stating, "These things may seem ridiculous to others, even as ridiculous as they were in themselves, but to me they were the most tormenting cogitations."&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|54}} He wrote two pamphlets advising those suffering from similar anxieties.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|217–218}} In one of them, he warns against indulging in compulsions:&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|217–218}} "Have care of putting off your trouble of spirit in the wrong way: by promising to reform yourself and lead a new life, by your performances or duties".&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|218}}

British poet, essayist and lexicographer [[Samuel Johnson]] (1709–1784) also suffered from OCD.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|54–55}} He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, and repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westsuffolkpsych.homestead.com/Johnson.html |title=SAMUEL JOHNSON (1709–1784): A Patron Saint of OCD? by Fred Penzel, Ph.D. from the Scientific Advisory Board of the International OCD Foundation |website=Westsuffolkpsych.homestead.com |accessdate=29 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615085035/http://westsuffolkpsych.homestead.com/Johnson.html |archivedate=15 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} He would touch every post on the street as he walked past,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} only step in the middles of paving stones,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} and repeatedly perform tasks as though they had not been done properly the first time.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} The American aviator and filmmaker [[Howard Hughes]] is known to have had OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes.aspx |title=Hughes's germ phobia revealed in psychological autopsy |last1=Dittmann |first1=M |date=July–August 2005 |website=American Psychological Association |accessdate=9 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105071029/http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes.aspx |archivedate=5 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends of Hughes have also mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes.html | journal=APA Online: Monitor on Psychology | volume=36 | issue=7 | date=July–August 2005 | author1=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1916">A national epic is an epic poem or a literary work of epic scope which seeks or is believed to capture and express the essence or spirit of a particular nation; not necessarily a nation state, but at least an ethnic or linguistic group with aspirations to independence or autonomy. National epics frequently recount the origin of a nation, a part of its history, or a crucial event in the development of national identity such as other national symbols.

==Supranational Epics==
*[[The Americas]] - ''[[The True History of the Conquest of New Spain]]'' by [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]
*[[Indic Civilization]] – the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]''
*[[Mesoamerican Civilization]] – the ''[[Popol Vuh]]''
*[[Sinic world]] – the [[Four Great Classical Novels]]: ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]],'' ''[[Water Margin]],'' ''[[Journey to the West]],'' and ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]
*[[Western Civilization]] – the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' of Homer and the ''[[Aeneid]]'' of Vergil

==Language Epics==
{{see|National epic}}
For languages spread across various nations, earlier [[national epic]]s of the older nation work as language epics. For example, national epics of England, such as ''[[The Canterbury Tales]],'' or the works of ''[[Shakespeare]]'' are used as language epics across the English-speaking world, and the ''[[Shahnameh]],'' the national epic of Iran (Persia) is used as a language epic by other [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking communities, in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. See [[national epic]]s for more examples.

Religious texts such as ''[[The King James Bible]]'' (English), ''[[Luther Bible]]'' (German), ''[[Quran]]'' (Arabic), and ''[[Tanakh]]'' (Hebrew) have similar impact within a specific language, while the Bible itself (in all translations) is instead a supranational epic of Western civilization.

A '''pen''' is a [[writing tool|writing instrument]] used to apply [[ink]] to a surface, usually paper, for writing or [[drawing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pen Pen]. Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, [[reed pen]]s, [[quill]] pens, and [[dip pen]]s were used, with a [[Nib (pen)|nib]] dipped in ink. [[Ruling pen]]s allow precise adjustment of line width, and still find a few specialized uses, but [[technical pen]]s such as the [[Rotring#Products|Rapidograph]] are more commonly used. Modern types include [[ballpoint pen|ballpoint]], [[rollerball pen|rollerball]], [[fountain pen|fountain]] and [[Marker pen|felt]] or [[porous point pen|ceramic tip]] pens.&lt;ref&gt;"pen."    Word Histories and Mysteries. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2004. Credo Reference. Web. 13 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Modern===
The main modern types of pens can be categorized by the kind of writing tip or point on the pen:
[[File:03-BICcristal2008-03-26.jpg|thumb|An inexpensive  [[Bic Cristal]] ballpoint pen]]
* A '''[[ballpoint pen]]''' dispenses an oil-based ink by rolling a [[Ball bearing|small hard sphere]], usually 0.5–1.2&amp;nbsp;mm and made of brass, steel, or [[tungsten carbide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How does a ballpoint pen work? |work=Engineering |publisher=HowStuffWorks |date=1998–2007 |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question683.htm |accessdate=2007-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ink dries almost immediately on contact with paper. The ballpoint pen is usually reliable and comes in both inexpensive and expensive types. It has replaced the fountain pen as the most common tool for everyday writing.  (There are certain ballpoint pens combining multiple colours in a single barrel; the writer or artist may depress the tip with the desired colour.)
[[File:A golden silver ball point pen.jpg|thumb|A luxury ballpoint pen]]
* A '''[[rollerball pen]]''' dispenses a water-based liquid or [[gel pen|gel]] ink through a ball tip similar to that of a ballpoint pen. The less-viscous ink is more easily absorbed by paper than oil-based ink, and the pen moves more easily across a writing surface. The rollerball pen was initially designed to combine the convenience of a ballpoint pen with the smooth "wet ink" effect of a fountain pen. Gel inks are available in a range of colors, including [[metallic paint]] colors, glitter effects, neon, blurred effects, saturated colors, [[pastel]] tones, vibrant shades, shady colors, [[invisible ink]], [[see-through]] effect, shiny colors, and glow-in-the-dark effects. Refillable rollerball pens have recently become available using cartridges of fountain pen ink.
* A '''[[fountain pen]]''' uses water-based liquid ink delivered through a ''[[Nib (pen)|nib]]''. The ink flows from a reservoir through a "feed" to the nib, then through the nib, due to [[capillary action]] and gravity. The nib has no moving parts and delivers ink through a thin slit to the writing surface. A fountain pen reservoir can be refillable or disposable; the disposable type is called an ''ink cartridge''. A pen with a refillable reservoir may have a mechanism, such as a piston, to draw ink from a bottle through the nib, or it may require refilling with an [[Pipette|eyedropper]]. Refill reservoirs, also known as ''cartridge converters'', are available for some pens which use disposable cartridges. A fountain pen can be used with permanent or non-permanent inks.
* A '''[[felt tip|felt-tip pen]]''', or [[Marker pen|marker]], has a porous tip of fibrous material. The smallest, finest-tipped felt-tip pens are used for writing on paper. Medium-tipped felt-tips are often used by children for coloring and drawing. Larger types, often called "markers", are used for writing in larger sizes, often on other surfaces such as corrugated boxes, [[whiteboard]]s and for [[chalkboard]]s, often called "liquid chalk" or "chalkboard markers". Markers with wide tips and bright but [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] ink, called ''[[highlighter]]s'', are used to highlight text that has already been written or printed. Pens designed for children or for temporary writing (as with a whiteboard or overhead projector) typically use [[non-permanent marker|non-permanent inks]]. Large markers used to label shipping cases or other packages are usually [[permanent marker]]s.
* A '''[[gel pen]]''' uses ink in which [[pigment]] is [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in a [[water]]-based [[gel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/archive/ci/31/i09/html/09lw.html |title=The Last Word: Just for the gel of it|date=September 2001|volume= 31|issue= 9|page= IBC|first=Debra A. |last=Schwartz|journal=Chemical Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ink is thick and [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], it shows up more clearly on dark or slick surfaces than the typical inks used in [[ballpoint pen|ballpoint]] or [[marker pen|felt tip]] pens. Gel pens can be used for many types of writing and illustration. Gel pens often come in bright or neon colors.
* A '''[[stylus pen]]''', plural styli or styluses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stylus|title=Stylus - Define Stylus at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[writing utensil]] or a small tool for some other form of marking or shaping, for example, in [[pottery]]. It can also be a computer accessory that is used to assist in navigating or providing more [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] when using [[touchscreens]]. It usually refers to a narrow elongated staff, similar to a modern [[ballpoint pen]]. Pens exist which contain a ballpoint tip on one end and this sort of touchscreen stylus on the other.

=== Historic ===
These historic types of pens are no longer in common use as writing instruments, but may be used by calligraphers and other artists:
[[File:Dip Pen.jpg|thumb|A dip pen]]
* A '''[[dip pen]]''' (or ''nib pen'') consists of a metal nib with [[capillary action|capillary channels]], like that of a fountain pen, mounted on a handle or holder, often made of wood. A dip pen usually has no ink reservoir and must be repeatedly recharged with ink while drawing or writing. The dip pen has certain advantages over a fountain pen. It can use waterproof pigmented (particle-and-binder-based) inks, such as [[India ink]], drawing ink, or acrylic inks, which would destroy a fountain pen by clogging, as well as the traditional [[iron gall ink]], which can cause corrosion in a fountain pen. Dip pens are now mainly used in illustration, [[calligraphy]], and comics. A particularly fine-pointed type of dip pen known as a ''crowquill'' is a favorite instrument of artists, such as [[David Stone Martin]] and [[Jay Lynch]], because its flexible metal point can create a variety of delicate lines, textures and tones with slight pressures while drawing.
* The '''[[ink brush]]''' is the traditional writing implement in [[Calligraphy|East Asian calligraphy.]] The body of the brush can be made from either bamboo, or rarer materials such as red sandalwood, glass, ivory, silver, and gold. The head of the brush can be made from the hair (or feathers) of a wide variety of animals, including the weasel, rabbit, deer, chicken, duck, goat, pig, tiger, etc. There is also a tradition in both China and Japan of making a brush using the hair of a newborn, as a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir for the child. This practice is associated with the legend of an ancient Chinese scholar who scored first in the Imperial examinations by using such a personalized brush. Calligraphy brushes are widely considered an extension of the calligrapher's arm. Today, calligraphy may also be done using a pen, but pen calligraphy does not enjoy the same prestige as traditional brush calligraphy.
* A '''[[quill]]''' is a pen made from a [[flight feather]] of a large bird, most often a [[goose]]. Quills were used as instruments for writing with ink before the metal dip pen, the fountain pen, and eventually the ballpoint pen came into use. Quill pens were used in medieval times to write on [[parchment]] or paper. The quill eventually replaced the reed pen.
* A '''[[reed pen]]''' is cut from a reed or bamboo, with a slit in a narrow tip. Its mechanism is essentially similar to that of a quill. The reed pen has almost disappeared but it is still used by young school students in some parts of India and Pakistan, who learn to write with them on small timber boards known as "Takhti".

==History==

[[File:US68445.png|thumb|left|M. Klein and Henry W. Wynne received US patent#68445 in 1867 for an ink chamber and delivery system in the handle of the fountain pen.]]

[[Ancient Egypt]]ians had developed writing on [[papyrus]] scrolls when scribes used thin reed brushes or [[reed pen]]s from the ''[[Juncus maritimus]]'' or sea rush.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.umich.edu/pap/exhibits/writing/reed_pen.html Egyptian reed pen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221023715/http://www.lib.umich.edu/pap/exhibits/writing/reed_pen.html |date=2007-02-21 }} Retrieved March 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''A History of Writing'', Steven Roger Fischer suggests that on the basis of finds at [[Saqqara]], the reed pen might well have been used for writing on parchment as long ago as the First Dynasty or about 3000 BC. Reed pens continued to be used until the [[Middle Ages]], but were slowly replaced by quills from about the 7th century. The reed pen, generally made from bamboo, is still used in some parts of Pakistan by young students and is used to write on small wooden boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spinfold.com/evolution-of-pen/|title=Evolution of pen - From Reed Pen to 3Doodler - Spinfold|website=www.spinfold.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Three-pens-six-nibs.jpg|150px|thumb|Historic pens]]

The reed pen survived until papyrus was replaced as a writing surface by animal skins, vellum and parchment. The smoother surface of skin allowed finer, smaller writing with a [[quill]] pen, derived from the flight feather.&lt;ref&gt;"pen." The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather guide. Abington: Helicon, 2010. Credo Reference. Web. 17 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The quill pen was used in Qumran, Judea to write some of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], which date back to around 100 BC. The scrolls were written in [[Hebrew]] dialects with bird feathers or quills. There is a specific reference to quills in the writings of [[St. Isidore of Seville]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511217593&amp;ss=ind The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville], Cambridge Catalogue Retrieved March 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Quill pens were still widely used in the eighteenth century, and were used to write and sign the [[Constitution of the United States]] in 1787.

A copper [[nib (pen)|nib]] was found in the ruins of [[Pompeii]], showing that metal nibs were used in the year 79.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arnoldwagner.com/dippens/dip_pens1.htm Arnold Wagner – Dip Pens]. Retrieved March 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a reference to 'a silver pen to carry ink in', in [[Samuel Pepys]]' diary for August 1663.&lt;ref&gt;'This evening came a letter about business from Mr Coventry, and with it a silver pen to carry inke in, which is very necessary.' Diary of Samuel Pepys, 5 August 1663:http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1663/08/&lt;/ref&gt; 'New invented' metal pens are advertised in ''The Times'' in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;The advertisement implies metal nibs had been in use for some years, but had not been generally accepted due to lack of flexibility and tendency to rust. It refers to 'Ivory Handles' with 'Gold Silver or Steel Pens to each', and says that 'new pens may be fitted in at pleasure', indicating that only the nibs were metal. It also claims the pens have 'well-tempered Elasticity' and that the 'Steel Points' are treated to be rustproof, rust being 'a circumstance that has been long and universally complained of in this article'.{{cite journal|title=The Times|date=8 June 1792|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A metal pen point was patented in 1803, but the patent was not commercially exploited. A patent for the manufacture of metal pens was advertised for sale by [[Bryan Donkin]] in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;He offered the patent, which had an unexpired term of 11 years, for sale together with the 'utensils peculiarly adapted to the manufacturing' of the metal pens:{{cite journal|title=The Times|date=15 August 1811|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Mitchell of [[Birmingham]] started to mass-produce pens with metal nibs in 1822, and after that, the quality of steel nibs improved enough so that dip pens with metal nibs came into general use.&lt;ref&gt;In 1832 a woman accused of stealing a silver pen from a London shop said in her defence that she had 'one of the common metal pens' with her:{{cite journal|title=The Times|date=15 September 1832|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schwenter - Deliciae physico-mathematicae oder Mathemat. und philosophische Erquickstunden, 1636 - 4696404.tif|thumb|''Deliciae physico-mathematicae'', 1636]]
The earliest historical record of a pen with a reservoir dates back to the 10th century AD. In 953, [[Al Muizz|Ma'ād al-Mu'izz]], the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid Caliph]] of [[Egypt]], demanded a pen which would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen which held ink in a reservoir and delivered it to the nib.&lt;ref name="bosworth1981"&gt;{{citation|journal=[[Journal of Semitic Studies]]|volume=XXVI|issue=i|date=Autumn 1981|title=A Mediaeval Islamic Prototype of the Fountain Pen?|first=C. E.|last=Bosworth}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pen may have been a fountain pen, but its mechanism remains unknown, and only one record mentioning it has been found. A later reservoir pen was developed in 1636. In his ''Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae'' (1636), [[Germans|German]] inventor [[Daniel Schwenter]] described a pen made from two quills. One quill served as a reservoir for ink inside the other quill. The ink was sealed inside the quill with [[cork (material)|cork]]. Ink was squeezed through a small hole to the writing point. In 1809, Bartholomew Folsch received a patent in England for a pen with an ink reservoir.&lt;ref name="bosworth1981"/&gt;

While a student in [[Paris]], [[Romania]]n [[Petrache Poenaru]] invented the fountain pen, which the [[French Government]] patented in May 1827. Fountain pen patents and production then increased in the 1850s.

The first patent on a ballpoint pen was issued on October 30, 1888, to John J Loud.&lt;ref&gt;GB Patent No. 15630, October 30, 1888&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, [[László Bíró]], a Hungarian newspaper editor, with the help of his brother George, a chemist, began to design new types of pens, including one with a tiny [[ball]] in its tip that was free to turn in a socket. As the pen moved along the paper, the ball rotated, picking up ink from the ink cartridge and leaving it on the paper. Bíró filed a British patent on June 15, 1938. In 1940 the Bíró brothers and a friend, Juan Jorge Meyne, moved to [[Argentina]] fleeing Nazi Germany. On June 10 they filed another patent, and formed "Bíró Pens of [[Argentina]]". By the summer of 1943 the first commercial models were available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quido.cz/objevy/propis.a.htm The Ballpoint Pen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417165418/http://www.quido.cz/objevy/propis.a.htm |date=2007-04-17 }}, Quido Magazin. Retrieved March 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Erasable ballpoint pens were introduced by [[Papermate]] in 1979 when the [[Erasermate]] was put on the market.

[[File:Vulcan Ink Pencil advertisement, 1915.jpg|thumb|1915 advertisement for "Vulcan" Ink Pencils]]
[[Slavoljub Eduard Penkala]], a naturalized [[Croats|Croatian]] engineer and inventor of [[Poles|Polish]]-[[Dutch people|Dutch]] origin from the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] in [[Austria-Hungary]], became renowned for further development of the mechanical pencil (1906) – then called an "automatic pencil" – and the first solid-ink fountain pen (1907). Collaborating with an entrepreneur by the name of [[Edmund Moster]], he started the Penkala-Moster Company and built a pen-and-pencil factory that was one of the biggest in the world at the time. This company, now called ''TOZ-Penkala'', still exists today. "TOZ" stands for "''Tvornica olovaka Zagreb''", meaning "[[Zagreb]] Pencil Factory".

[[File:Marker1.jpg|thumb|Modern marker pens]]
In the 1960s, the fiber or [[felt-tipped pen]] was invented by Yukio Horie of the [[Pentel|Tokyo Stationery Company, Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blpen.htm History of Pens &amp; Writing Instruments], About Inventors site. Retrieved March 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paper Mate]]'s Flair was among the first felt-tip pens to hit the U.S. market in the 1960s, and it has been the leader ever since. [[Marker pen]]s and [[highlighter]]s, both similar to felt pens, have become popular in recent times.

[[Rollerball pen]]s were introduced in the early 1970s. They use a mobile ball and liquid ink to produce a smoother line. Technological advances during the late 1980s and early 1990s have improved the roller ball's overall performance. A [[porous point pen]] contains a point made of some porous material such as felt or ceramic. A high quality drafting pen will usually have a ceramic tip, since this wears well and does not broaden when pressure is applied while writing.
Although the invention of the typewriter and [[personal computer]] with the [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] input method has offered another way to write, the pen is still the main means of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/netguide/2003/may/05genx.htm |title=Losing touch with paper and pen |publisher=Rediff.com |date=2003-05-05 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people like to use expensive types and brands of pens, including fountain pens, and these are sometimes regarded as a [[status symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;Guilfoil, John M.

Another manufacturer emerged from the depths of marketing with "Bic pens" in 1953, named Michael Bich. He introduced new ballpoint pens to the American marketplace in the 1950s, and became successful in selling his Bic pens in the 1960s when he published his campaign slogan,"Writes The First Time, Every Time!". The era of the 1940s-1960s was a competitive era for every manufacture manufacturing [pens] at this period of time.

'''''Perry Rhodan''''' is the eponymous hero of a German science fiction novel series which has been published each week since  8 September 1961 in the 'Romanhefte' format (digest-sized booklets, usually containing 66 pages, the German equivalent of the now-defunct American [[pulp magazine]]) by [http://www.vpm.de/ Pabel-Moewig Verlag], a subsidiary of Bauer Media Group. As of March 2018, almost 2950 booklet novels of the original series plus 850 spinoff novels of the sister series ''[[:de:Atlan|Atlan]]'' plus over 400 paperbacks and 200 hardcovers have been published, totalling over 300,000 pages. Having sold approximately two billion copies (in [[novella]] format) worldwide alone, (including over one billion in Germany), it is the most successful science fiction book series ever written. The first billion of worldwide sales was celebrated in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perry-rhodan-usa.com/web1998/rdnpres.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430072534/http://www.perry-rhodan-usa.com/web1998/rdnpres.htm |date=30 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 126 novels (plus five novels of the spinoff series ''Atlan'') were translated into English and published by [[Ace Books]] between 1969 and 1978, with the same translations used for the British edition published by Futura Publications which issued only 39 novels. When Ace cancelled its translation of the series, translator Wendayne Ackerman self-published the following 19 novels (under the business name 'Master Publications') and made them available by subscription only. Financial disputes with the German publishers led to the cancellation of the American translation in 1979.

An attempt to revive the series in English was made in 1997–1998 by Vector Publications of the US which published translations of four issues (1800–1803) from the current storyline being published in Germany at the time.

The series and its spin-offs have captured a substantial fraction of the original German science fiction output and exert influence on many German writers in the field.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The series is told in an [[Story arc|arc storyline]] structure. An arc—called a "cycle"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perry-rhodan.net/information/faq/faq2.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828140319/http://www.perry-rhodan.net/information/faq/faq2.html |date=28 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—would have anywhere from 25 to 100 issues devoted to it, similar subsequent cycles are referred to as a "grand-cycle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perry-rhodan.net/information/nathan/geschichte/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209093629/http://www.perry-rhodan.net/information/nathan/geschichte/index.html |date=9 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthias Rust]], the then-19 year old aviator who landed his [[Cessna 172]] aircraft on the [[Red Square]] in [[Moscow]] in 1987, has cited Perry Rhodan's adventures as his main inspiration to penetrate Soviet airspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Deutsche Welle|title = Kremlin Caper: Mathias Rust's Landing on Red Square|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wue02Y0lS38|accessdate = 2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
‘Perry Rhodan, der Erbe des Universums’ (Eng: ‘The Heir to the Universe’, though the American/British editions instead used the subtitle 'Peacelord of the Universe') was created by German science fiction authors [[K. H. Scheer]] and [[Walter Ernsting]] and launched in 1961 by German publishing house Arthur Moewig Verlag (now Pabel-Moewig Verlag). Originally planned as a 30 to 50 volume series, it has been published continuously every week since, reaching more than 2,950 issues as of March 2018.  Written by an ever-changing team of authors, many of whom, however, remained with the series for decades or life, ''Perry Rhodan'' is issued in weekly [[novella]]-size installments in the traditional German ''Heftroman'' ([[Pulp magazine|pulp booklet]]) format.  Unlike most German Heftromane Perry Rhodan consists not of unconnected novels but is a series with a continuous, increasingly complex plotline, with frequent back references to events. In addition to its original Heftroman form, the series now also appears in hardcovers, paperbacks, e-books, comics and audiobooks.

Over the decades there have also been [[comic strip]]s, numerous collectibles, several encyclopedias, audio plays, inspired music, etc.  The series has seen partial translations into several languages.  It also spawned the 1967 movie ''[[Mission Stardust]]'' (aka ''…4 …3 …2 …1 …morte''),&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb title|0063859|...4 ...3 ...2 ...1 ...morte|(aka ''Mission Stardust'')}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is widely considered so terrible that many fans of the series pretend it never existed.&lt;ref name="SpinningImage_2009"&gt;

The story line starts in 1971 with the first manned [[moon landing]] by U.S. Space Force Major Perry Rhodan and his crew, who discover a marooned extraterrestrial space ship from the (fictional) planet Arkon in the (real) [[Messier 13|M13 cluster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unternehmen Stardust – Perrypedia|url = http://www.perrypedia.proc.org/wiki/Quelle:PR1|website = www.perrypedia.proc.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriating the Arkonide technology, they proceed to unify [[Earth|Terra]] and carve out a place for humanity in the galaxy and the cosmos. (The concepts for two of the technical accomplishments that enable them to do so—[[positronic brains]] and starship drives for near-instantaneous [[Hyperspace (science fiction)#Asimovian Hyperspace|hyperspatial translation]]—are direct adoptions from [[Isaac Asimov]]'s science fiction universe.)

As the series progresses, major characters, including the title character, are granted relative [[immortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Der Unsterbliche – Perrypedia|url = http://www.perrypedia.proc.org/wiki/Quelle:PR19|website = www.perrypedia.proc.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is ''relative'' in the sense that they are immune to age and disease, but could suffer a violent death. The story continues over the course of millennia, including flashbacks thousands and even millions of years into the past, and the scope widens to encompass other galaxies, extremely remote parts of space, [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]s and weirder cosmic structures, time travel, paranormal powers, weird/cute/aggressive aliens and bodyless entities (some with sheer god-like powers).

===Universe and multiverse===
The universe in which the plot regularly takes place is called the Einstein Universe (and occasionally "Meekorah"). Its laws are mostly identical to those of our real universe. Newer theories about [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] are currently not used in the series, and sometimes the laws of nature follow old theories that have been disproven—to protect the plot.

This Einstein Universe is only one in a large ensemble of universes, each to a greater or lesser extent different from it (for example a universe in which time runs slower, an anti-matter universe, a shrinking universe). Additionally, each universe possesses a large ensemble of parallel timelines, which are usually unreachable from each other but may be accessed by special means—thereby itself creating many more parallel timelines.

The Einstein Universe is embedded in a high-dimensional manifold, called [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|Hyperspace]]. This hyperspace consists of several subspaces, that are used by different technologies for faster-than-light travel. The exact traits of those higher dimensions are not thoroughly explained. The border of the universe is a dimension called ''the deep'' (once used for construction of the gigantic discworld "Deepland").

===Psionic Web and Moralic Code===

The ''Psionic Web'' crosses invisibly through the whole universe, constantly emitting "vital energy" and "psionic energy", guaranteeing normal (organic among others) life and the well-being of higher entities.

The ''Moralic Code'' crosses through all universes, and is linked to the Psionic Web. It is subdivided into the Cosmogenes, which are again subdivided into the Cosmonucleotids. (These names and associations to DNA were given by the cosmocrats, and should not be misunderstood as having an absolute ethical meaning.) The Cosmonucleotids determine reality and fate themselves for their respective parts of a given universe, via ''messengers''.

Higher beings are trying to gain control of this possibility to rule reality itself. The Moralic Code itself was not installed by the higher beings, the higher powers by themselves have no clue why or by whom the Code was made.

Once the cosmocrats ordered Perry Rhodan to find the answers to the three ultimate questions; apparently they have known the answer to the first and second question but not to the third, which reads "Who initiated the LAW and what does it cause?". Perry Rhodan had the chance to receive the answer at the mountain of creation, but he refused, knowing that the answer would destroy his mind.
It is known that the negative Superintelligence Koltoroc had received the answer to the last ultimate question, 69 million years BC at Negane Mountain, but it is not known if it made any use of that knowledge.

===Onion-shell model===

To all life, an evolutionary theory called the "onion-shell model" is employed. It states that there is a continuous evolution from lower life-forms (bacteria) to higher life-forms like intelligent life and finally bodyless entities. Upon invention, the onion-shell-model was used by the authors as if there were definite and discrete stages in cosmological evolution. However, later in the series, further life-forms, representing stages between the known shells, were introduced.

The main shells are:
# Life-less matter
# Bacteria
# Higher animals
# Intelligent species
# Intelligent species that have contacted other species
# Superintelligences (SI)
# Matter-fountains / Matter-sinks
# Cosmocrats / Chaotarchs (High Powers)
# Powers close to the "Horizon of the LAW", the essence of the Multiverse ([http://www.perrypedia.proc.org/wiki/Quelle:PR2874 "Thez", Volume 2874])

The superintelligences are the next step above normal minds. They are born, for example, when a species collectively gives up its bodies and unites their spirits. Those superintelligences claim a domain as theirs, consisting of up to several galaxies (the entity known as "ES ('IT')" has the [[Local Group]] as personal domain). The superintelligence nourishes mentally on the species in its domain, sometimes symbiotically (positive SI), sometimes parasitically (negative SI). Again, these attributes should not be treated as ethical description, although negative superintelligences are in general described as being more sinister.

The matter-fountains/matter-sinks are born, when a superintelligence fuses with all life and matter in its domain while shrinking. Little more is known, except that the process is gradual and that the resulting object doesn't have the intense gravitational pull it would have if the contraction produced a black hole.

The "high powers" were long known to be the highest known life-forms. They live in an unimaginable, distant dimension and have great powers in ruling over lower beings. However they are not omniscient and they are unable to directly interact with lower beings. To enter a regular universe, they have to put on a mortal shape, reducing their powers and sometimes their knowledge/memory. This is known as the transform-syndrome. Due to this, they interact with lower beings rarely and instead enlist individuals, organisations or entire species.

===Conflict between the high powers===

Among the high powers are two factions known as the cosmocrats and the chaotarchs. The cosmocrats want to transform all universes into a state of absolute order (a state of utmost entropy, usual symbol S), while the chaotarchs want to transform all universes into a state of absolute chaos (negative entropy). Accordingly, they are engulfed in a cataclysmic neverending war, stretching among almost all known universes. They are ruthlessly using, manipulating and dooming whole species for their actions. However, open warfare is just one tool among many in their epic conflict. In the previous cycle (2300–2499) the [[Milky Way]] galaxy was victim of a full-fledged military assault by the forces of chaos trying to establish a bastion of chaos, a negasphere, in the nearby galaxy Hangay.

Recently it was revealed to the protagonists that life itself has become a rival to the higher powers. It has spread uncontrollably among the universe and can be found in virtually every niche. The cosmocrats and chaotarchs both use life for its tendencies to create order and chaos alike. Its unplanned and unregulated cosmological actions and manipulations are a constant disturbance for the plans of the cosmocrats and the chaotarchs alike. The ''[http://www.perrypedia.proc.org/wiki/Pangalaktische_Statistiker Pangalactic Statisticians]'' (a neutral organization of observers) have stated that 21% of all cosmological manipulations are executed by cosmocrat-servants, 16% are executed by chaos-servants and 63% are executed by the vast uncontrollable life itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pangalaktische Statistiker – Perrypedia|url = http://www.perrypedia.proc.org/wiki/Pangalaktische_Statistiker|website = www.perrypedia.proc.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce the influence of life, the cosmocrats have stopped their programs that encourage the development of life and intelligence. Additionally, they have increased the ''hyper-impedance'', drastically reducing the effectivity and durability of most forms of hyper-technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hyperimpedanz – Perrypedia|url = http://www.perrypedia.proc.org/wiki/Hyperimpedanz|website = www.perrypedia.proc.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, at least one power developed higher than the cosmocrats and chaotarchs has been identified: [http://www.perrypedia.proc.org/wiki/Quelle:PR2874 Thez]. It is said that it lives so close to the "Horizon of the LAW" that both cosmocrats and chaotarchs have problems to understand it.

==Critical reaction==
In the introduction to the first English-language edition of Perry Rhodan in 1969, [[Forrest J Ackerman]] said that "In Germany, all serious SF buffs claim to hate Perry Rhodan, but ''somebody'' (in unprecedented numbers) is certainly reading him."&lt;ref name="PR001_intro"&gt;

Many American SF fans agreed with the first part of that statement, feeling the series was an embarrassment and too "juvenile". [[Tom Doherty]], new head of Ace Books in the mid-to-late '70s, concurred and ended the series in the US, even though it was profitable.&lt;ref name="AshleyAshley2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mike Ashley|author2=Michael Ashley|title=Gateways to Forever: The Story of the Science-Fiction Magazines from 1970-1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qkmF8HvP_gC&amp;pg=PA218|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=14 May 2007|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-1-84631-003-4|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision meant that by 1980, when the original German versions of Perry Rhodan were becoming "more sophisticated and less aimed at younger readers", the series was no longer available in English.&lt;ref name="Painter2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah Painter|title=Forry: The Life of Forrest J Ackerman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sL2oreiBQ6wC&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=17 February 2013|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5798-4|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic Robert Reginald described the series as the "ultimate soap opera of science fiction"&lt;ref name="Reginald1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Reginald|title=Xenograffiti: Essays on Fantastic Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32BTOjrnmhgC&amp;pg=PA256|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=1 November 1996|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=978-0-8095-1900-2|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; and standard "pulp science fiction, action stories with minimal characterization, awful dialog, but relatively complex plot development. The emphasis is always on man's expanding horizons, the wonder of science and space, the great destiny of the human race."&lt;ref name="BarronReginald2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Neil Barron|author2=Robert Reginald|title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Book Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NEpIG3YcjDwC&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=November 2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=978-0-89370-609-8|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series' beginnings were often criticized for their description of an expansive mankind and frequent space battles; after [[:de:William Voltz|William Voltz]] took over the position of storyline planner for the series in 1975 (a post he held until his death in 1984), the series developed a broader ethical scope and also evolved in terms of storytelling style.

But while many critics dismiss the series, many others praise it. There appears to be the conundrum that, especially in the US, the newer, more complex parts of the series have never been published, so critical review tends to be concentrated on the rather simple origins of the series. [[John O'Neill (editor)|John O'Neill]] has called Perry Rhodan "one of the richest—if not the richest—Space Operas ever written."&lt;ref name="O'Neill_1998"&gt;"

==Publication==
===English translation===
In the 1960s, [[Forrest J Ackerman]] organized the publication in the U.S. of an English translation of the series, with his wife Wendayne in charge of translation. Other translators on the series included Sig Wahrmann, Stuart J. Byrne, and Dwight Decker. Number&amp;nbsp;1, containing German issues&amp;nbsp;1 and&amp;nbsp;2, was published by [[Ace Books]] starting in 1969. Acting as Managing Editor, Ackerman soon incorporated elements reminiscent of the SF pulp magazines of his youth, such as short stories, serialized novels and a film review section. The series was a commercial success, eventually being published three times per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Forrest J Ackerman|title=Editorial announcement in Perry Rhodan #69: The Bonds of Eternity |year=1975|publisher=Ace Books, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ace ended its regular run of Perry Rhodan in August 1977 with double issue #117/118. However this was followed by the publication of three "missing" stories (i.e. novellas from earlier in the series which had not been translated and left out of the series by editorial decision),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Forrest J Ackerman|title=Editorial announcement in Perry Rhodan #117/118: Savior of the Empire/The Shadows Attack |year=1977|publisher=Ace Books, Inc.|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; accompanied by three novellas from the Perry Rhodan spinoff series ''Atlan''.

Ace concluded its run of translations with two further Atlan novels and a novel-length story, 'In the Center of the Galaxy [German: In Zentrum der Galaxis] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.perrypedia.proc.org/wiki/Im_Zentrum_der_Galaxis&lt;/ref&gt;' by [[Clark Darlton]], which had appeared in German as issue 11 of the "Perry Rhodan Planet Novels [Planetenromane]" spin-off series.

When Ace cancelled its publication of the series in 1978, translator Wendayne Ackerman self-published the following 19 novels  (numbered #119 – 137) under the business name  Master Publications before this subscription-only edition was also cancelled in 1979. That was the end of an English version until the 1990s, when Vector Enterprises restarted an American version. This version lasted for four printed issues and one electronic issue—#1800 to #1804.

In 2006 Pabel-Moewig Verlag licensed [[FanPro]] to publish an English translation of the "Perry Rhodan: Lemuria" miniseries. Some material present in the German version, such as a history of generation spaceships in science fiction, was dropped from the American version.  Only the first volume was released.

In 2015—16, Perry Rhodan Digital published English translations of the full six-volume ''Perry Rhodan: Lemuria'' story arc in [[ebook]] format, making these available via [[iTunes]] and other digital platforms.

===In other countries===
Translations of Perry Rhodan are currently available in Brazil (#1 to #536 and #650 to #847 as of August 2011), and also from 537 to 649; 1400 in before (at present, in December 2014), including the series Atlan, Planetary Novels and Perry Rhodan NEO (at present in the n. 28), all launched by the "Project Translation", Russia, China, Japan(#1 to #800 as of May 2011), France, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands (#1 to #2000 as of September 2009). Apart from the US version, there were also editions in Canada, Great Britain (#1 to #39), Italy and Finland. However, the latter have been discontinued.

The first language into which Perry Rhodan was translated was [[Hebrew]]. In 1965, the first four episodes appeared in [[Tel Aviv]] in a pirated translation, and which for unknown reasons ceased before publication of the fifth (it was not because it was detected by the German publishers, who only heard about it many years later). The few surviving copies of this 1965 translation are highly valued by Israeli collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notes.co.il/eshed/9520.asp |title=פרי רודאן -איש החלל הניצחי &amp;#124; המולטי יקום של אלי אשד |publisher=Notes.co.il |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
===In space===
[[File:Cover-perry rhodan-10.jpeg|thumb|The '''Perry Rhodan''' issue that went into space. Credit: ESA/André Kuipers]]
Dutch [[ESA]] astronaut [[André Kuipers]] was inspired to become an astronaut from an early age by the Perry Rhodan albums his grandmother bought for him (and that he eventually started buying himself from his allowance).  When he finally went into space, on 18 April 2004, he brought his very first booklet along with him. It was number ten in the red series, ''Ruimteoorlog in de Wegasector'' ("''Space War in the Vega Sector''" or ''"Raumschlacht im Wega-Sektor"'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Delta_Mission/SEM0W81PGQD_0.html |title=André Kuipers' diary – Part 2: Medical examination; six crowns / Delta Mission / Human Spaceflight / Our Activities / ESA |publisher=Esa.int |date=2004-02-16 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
[[Christopher Franke]], former member of German [[electronica]] group [[Tangerine Dream]] and soundtrack composer for U.S. science-fiction TV series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', released ''Perry Rhodan Pax Terra'' in 1996, composed of music inspired by the ''Perry Rhodan'' epic.

The German group [[The Psychedelic Avengers]] claim to be inspired by ''Perry Rhodan'' on their 2004 release ''[[And the Curse of the Universe]]''. The group [[Sensus]] released a song "Perry Rhodan ... More Than A Million Lightyears From Home" in 1986 (and presented it at the Worldcon in [[Saarbrücken]]).

===In science fiction fandom===
[[Bubonicon]], an annual science fiction convention in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], New Mexico, US, adopted as its mascot Perry Rhodent, a rat wearing only one shoe (or boot). Perry's image is reinvented each year for the convention's program and T-shirts, often by the convention's Artist Guest of Honor.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

[[George Lucas]], the creator of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, mentioned that he read the American translation of ''Perry Rhodan'' in the late 1960s and early 1970s and considers the series to be an "inspiration, less strong than Flash Gordon, but it influenced the design of many starships of Star Wars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cKLlUnyG4IQC&amp;pg=PA342 |title=Der deutsche Zukunftsroman 1918-1945: Gattungstypologie und ... - Dina Brandt - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/panorama/aus-aller-welt/science-fiction-serie-aus-rastatt-soll-verfilmt-werden-perry-rhodan-fordert-darth-vader-zum-duell-seite-2/2504942-2.html |title=Science-Fiction-Serie aus Rastatt soll verfilmt werden: Perry Rhodan fordert Darth Vader zum Duell - Seite 2 - Aus aller Welt - Panorama |language=de |publisher=Handelsblatt |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically made of lead alloy, they were sold as souvenirs at sites of [[Christian pilgrimage]] and bear imagery relating to the saint venerated there. The production of pilgrim badges flourished in the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, particularly in the 14th and 15th centuries, but declined after the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the mid-16th century. Tens of thousands have been found since the mid-19th century, predominantly in rivers. Together they form the largest corpus of medieval art objects to survive to us today.

Pilgrimage sites housed a saint's [[relic]]s: sometimes the whole body, sometimes a body part or significant object owned or touched by the saint. For example, St [[Thomas Becket]] was martyred at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in England in 1170 and his body remained there, becoming the epicentre of an enormously popular cult. In 1220 it was translated into a costly shrine. The pilgrim souvenirs associated with his cult have a particularly diverse array of imagery, including that of his shrine, his head [[reliquary]] and scenes from his life. Other major sites that produced badges were [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|Santiago de Compostela]], [[Cologne Cathedral|Cologne]], Our Lady of Rocamadour and Jerusalem. Their badges bore images that were iconic and easily recognisable, such as the [http://www.spainisculture.com/en/obras_de_excelencia/museo_de_las_peregrinaciones/insignia_de_peregrino.html scallop shell], the [http://blog.museumoflondon.org.uk/journey-magi-three-kings-cologne-london/ Adoration of the Magi], the [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=49954&amp;partId=1&amp;place=39435&amp;plaA=39435-2-11&amp;page=8&amp;sortBy=&amp;view=list St Peter] or the [[Jerusalem cross|Jerusalem Cross]]. Shrines to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin]] were common all over Christendom, as are badges associable with her.[http://collections.museumoflondon.org.uk/online/object/29149.html] They often show her holding the Infant Christ, or represent the first letter of her name.

== Origins ==
[[File:Ampulla Menas Louvre AF7035.jpg|thumb|4th-7th century clay pilgrim flask or ampulla. Pilgrims used ampullae like this to carry water or oil from the pilgrimage site for Saint Menas: a late-third-century Egyptian Roman soldier who was martyred for his Christian faith. He is shown between the two camels who returned his body to Egypt for burial]]
Various cultural practices converged to bring about the pilgrim badge. Pilgrims had long sought natural souvenirs from their destination to commemorate their trip and bring home some of the site's sanctity. The earliest and still iconic pilgrim 'badge' was the scallop shell worn by pilgrims to the shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela]]. Along with badges, vendors at holy sites sold [[ampulla]]e, small, tin vessels designed to carry holy water or oil from the site. The later metal examples derive from clay ampullae sold from the [[Early Middle Ages]] to pilgrims to the Holy Land and other sites in North Africa and the Middle East. These often bore images from the saint's life. The main vessel of the early ampullae from the shrine of St Thomas Becket is often textured to appear like a scallop shell, showing how flat, wearable signs and ampullae came to be conflated in the medieval imagination. Badges and ampullae were worn while travelling and allowed others to identify the wearer as a pilgrim and the saint they were visiting. They showed the wearer's special relationship with the saint and could be called upon in times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Push me, pull you.

==Manufacture and use==
[[File:Medieval pilgrim badge (FindID 482380).jpg|thumb|A medieval cast lead alloy monogram of Maria pilgrim badge. The badge is in the shape of a Lombardic 'm' with crown above. The crown is formed of three projections; the two outer projections are trefoil and the central is a single collared knop. The outline of the 'm' has a beaded border and in the gaps between the columns of the 'm' the casting seam can be seen. The reverse of the badge is plain; the catchplate has survived intact but only the stump of the pin remains]]
Pilgrim badges were cheaply mass-produced in bronze, cuttle-bone or limestone [[Molding (process)|moulds]] or, less frequently, by [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]-stamping.[https://sketchfab.com/models/c5eb876310be498c9a0a609cc309dfc0]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/models/c5eb876310be498c9a0a609cc309dfc0|title=Digital Pilgrim 3D model of a Thomas Becket badge mould|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their easy reproducibility and modest media meant that everyone could afford them. British pilgrim badges often have an integral pin and clasp on the reverse whereas continental European badges more usually have sewing loops, but this is not a hard and fast rule. Pilgrims wore badges on their outer clothing and hats or around the neck to show where they had been on pilgrimage.  Some were designed to be fixed to the top of pilgrim staffs.[https://sketchfab.com/models/b7e217b5a8eb45f9b4c0ed64e2bff47e] Freshly cast, lead alloy is shiny and bright but it tarnishes rapidly.

To make thin, lead alloy badges, makers would have to create a eutectic alloy. Only at a specific ratio would lead and tin cast thin enough to make the most of the cheapest metal. The quality of pilgrim badges varied considerably, with some being naive and crudely made and others displaying great craftsmanship and skill. Ampullae, vessels for holy water or oil, were harder to make than badges, necessitating a process called [[Permanent mold casting|slush casting]]. Much rarer examples were made in precious metals for the wealthy; these have mostly been recycled for their valuable materials over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-RdiayZt0QEC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=pilgrim+badge+silver&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mkLkS-eGC5LWmQPB-JVN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pilgrim%20badge%20silver&amp;f=false Viewing Renaissance art]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the later Middle Ages, thin, precious metal badges were being produced that were perfectly designed for being sewn into books. Manuscripts survive with badges still in them, or imprints on the pages where they once were.[https://www.kb.nl/en/themes/middle-ages/more-from-the-middle-ages/book-of-hours-with-pilgrim-badges] It is often possible to identify the shrine from the imprint. As artists became increasingly fascinated by illusionism or the [[Trompe-l'œil|trompe l'oeil]] technique, representations of pilgrim badges painted into the margins of prayer books appear.[http://ica.themorgan.org/manuscript/page/49/77004]

The most popular shrines sold over 100,000 badges a year, making pilgrim badges the first mass-produced tourist souvenir. In 1520, the church at Regensbury sold over 120,000 badges to medieval pilgrims, after a drastic shortage the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Medieval Pilgrimage|last=Taylor, Craig, Friedman, Izbicki, Tekippe (eds.)|first=|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|page=522|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==
Today, most pilgrim badges are recovered in or near rivers. Lynn Museum in Norfolk has a large collection of medieval badges that were collected in the 19th century by children, whom the local antiquarian would pay for their finds.[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/view/NCC095925][https://www.thecollectionmuseum.com/assets/downloads/IS_arch_6_pilgrims_in_medieval_lincolnshire.pdf] It has been suggested that this is because medieval pilgrims believed that the badges would bring good luck if they were thrown into water, however that theory is now contested.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe/p/pilgrim_badge_depicting_st_geo.aspx Pilgrim badge depicting St George and the dragon in the] [[British Museum]]; J. Lee, Medieval pilgrims’ badges in rivers: the curious history of a non-theory, ''Journal of Art Historiography Number 11'' (2014) [https://arthistoriography.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/lee.pdf https://arthistoriography.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/lee.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the pilgrim badges in the collection of [[The Salisbury Museum|Salisbury Museum]] were found when the town's medieval sewers were excavated. This, among other evidence, suggests they were eventually just thrown away.

== Imagery ==
[[File:Becket-pilgrim-badge.jpg|thumb|This badge represents the ornate head reliquary of St Thomas Becket and was probably sold near his shrine in Canterbury]]
Studying the imagery of pilgrim badges quickly leads to an ability to identify the shrine or saint associated with them. For example, [[Thomas Becket|St Thomas of Canterbury]] is often shown being martyred by one of a group of four knights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/models/7dd81a87e34644f3a0e50aaaf61cad44|title=3D model of a Canterbury pilgrim ampulla:|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of the [[Scallop#Shell of Saint James|scallop shell associated with pilgrimages]] along the [[Way of St James]] to the shrine of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] at [[Santiago de Compostela]] in modern Spain derived from shells collected by pilgrims on the beach. The relic of [[John the Baptist|St John the Baptist]]'s head, which was famously venerated at Amiens, is shown as a face on a plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/models/e761b7bbfac94c1d9c49b55e46586fb1|title=3D model of an Amiens pilgrim souvenir:|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images are frequentlty related to iconographic types found on monumental artwork, showing how mobile iconographies were across media and social spheres.

Badges were made in the Middle Ages for purposes beyond pilgrim souvenirs; [[livery badge]]s were presented to employees and allies by great figures, and became highly controversial in the decades leading to the [[Wars of the Roses]].  Some political badges have survived, including a fine one for the [[Black Prince]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/f/funerary_badge_black_prince.aspx British Museum badge of the Black Prince]

&lt;/ref&gt;  Other badges, with motifs such as lovers' tokens and mini brooches, were perhaps a form of cheap jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/models/e8644b481aa7494d92c9ce9c9998b9c9|title=3D model of a medieval lover's token inscribed 'Herte be Trewe'|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Erotic badges showing winged phalluses or vulvas dressed as pilgrims are prolific, although their cultural significance is still debated.[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=49050&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=phallus+medieval+badge+&amp;page=1] Gazing at a collection of pilgrim souvenirs and medieval badges is to gain an insight into the visual world of medieval Christendom.

In England the tradition of making and wearing pilgrim badges died out in the early 16th century as pilgrimage initially declined in popularity and was then banned completely as the country became [[Protestantism|Protestant]] during the [[English Reformation]], when pilgrimage became regarded as a [[superstition]] and [[Idolatry|idolatrous]]. However, the tradition continued in Catholic Europe, in some cases to the present day.

{{Politics of the Republic of Macedonia}}

The existence and distinctiveness of the '''[[Macedonian language]]''' is disputed among linguists and common people from [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and its neighboring countries. The Eastern [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] indigenous to the current Republic of Macedonia are part of [[dialectal continuum]] which stretches from Croatian, Bosnian and [[Serbia]]n [[Shtokavian dialect]] through [[Torlakian dialect|Torlakian]] on the northwest, to western and eastern [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] dialects on the East, and the Macedonian language, like Bulgarian, [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], is a standardized form of (some of) these dialects.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

[[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Bulgarian ethnos]] in Macedonia existed long before the earliest articulations of the idea that [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian Slavs]] might form a separate ethnic group from the [[Bulgarians]] in Danubian Bulgaria and [[Thracian Bulgarians|Thrace]]. Throughout the period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, the Slav-speaking people of the geographic regions of [[Moesia]], [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] referred to their language as Bulgarian and called themselves Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;Verković, St. ''Narodne pesme makedonski bugara (Folk Songs of the Macedonian Bulgarians)''. Beograd, 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miladinov, D. and Miladinov, K. ''Bulgarian Folk Songs (Български народни песни)''. Zagreb, 1861.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Serbian researcher St. Verković who was a long term teacher in Macedonia, sent by the Serbian government with special assimilatory mission wrote in the preface of his collection of Bulgarian folk songs: "I named these songs Bulgarian, and not Slavic because today when you ask any Macedonian Slav: Who are you? he immediately answers: I am Bulgarian and call my language Bulgarian...."&lt;ref&gt;"Но ја сам ове песме назвао бугарскима, а не словенскима, због тога, јер данас кад би когод македонског Славенина запитао: што си ти? с места би му отговорно: я сам болгарин, а свој језик зову болгарским...", p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Bulgarian" for various Macedonian dialects can be seen from early vernacular texts such as the four-language dictionary of Daniil of Moschopole, the early works of Kiril Pejchinovich and Ioakim Kurchovski and some vernacular gospels written in the Greek alphabet. These written works influenced by or completely written in the Bulgarian vernacular were registered in Macedonia in the 18th and beginning of the 19th century and their authors referred to their language as Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Dr. Gustav Weigand, ETHNOGRAPHIE VON MAKEDONIEN, Geschichtlich-nationaler, spraechlich-statistischer Teil, Leipzig, Friedrich Brandstetter, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; The first samples of Bulgarian speech and the first grammar of modern Bulgarian language were written by the leading Serbian literator Vuk Karadjić on the basis of the Macedonian Razlog dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Vuk Karadjić. ''Dodatak k sanktpeterburgskim sravniteljnim rječnicima sviju jezika i narječja sa osobitim ogledom Bugarskog језика''. Vienna, 1822.&lt;/ref&gt; In those early years the re-emerging Bulgarian written language was still heavily influenced by Church Slavonic forms so dialectical differences were not very prominent between the Eastern and Western regions. Indeed, in those early years many Bulgarian activists sometimes even communicated in Greek in their writing.

When the Bulgarian national movement got under way in the second quarter of the 19th century some cities in Macedonia were among the first to demand education in Bulgarian and Bulgarian-speaking clerics for their churches.&lt;ref&gt;F. A. K. Yasamee "NATIONALITY IN THE BALKANS: THE CASE OF THE MACEDONIANS" in ''Balkans: A Mirror of the New World Order'', Istanbul: EREN, 1995; pp. 121-132.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s however, it was clear that the Central Balkan regions of Bulgaria were assuming leadership in linguistic and literary affairs. This was to a large extent due to the fact that the affluent towns on both sides of the Central Balkan range were able to produce more intellectuals educated in Europe than the relatively more backward other Bulgarian regions. Consequently, when the idea that the vernacular rather than Church Slavonic should be represented in the written language gained preponderance, it was the dialects of the Central Balkan region between [[Veliko Tarnovo]] and [[Plovdiv]] that were most represented.&lt;ref name="Strukova1"&gt;Струкова, К. П. ''Общественно-политическое развитие Македонии в 50-70-е гг XIX века'', Российская Академия наук, Москва 2004, стр. 85-136. {{ISBN|5-7576-0163-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent Bulgarian educators from Macedonia like [[Parteniy Zografski]] and [[Kuzman Shapkarev]] called for a stronger representation of Macedonian dialects in the Bulgarian literary language but their advice was not heeded at the time and sometimes met with hostility.&lt;ref name="Strukova1"/&gt; In the article ''[[s:The Macedonian question|The Macedonian Question]]'' by [[Petko Slaveykov|Petko Rachev Slaveykov]], published on 18 January 1871 in the [[Makedoniya (newspaper)|''Makedoniya'']] newspaper in Constantinople, [[Macedonism]] was criticized, his adherents were named Macedonists, and this is the earliest surviving indirect reference to it, although Slaveykov never used the word ''Macedonism''.The term's first recorded use is from 1887 by [[Stojan Novaković]] to describe Macedonism as a potential ally for the Serbian strategy to expand its territory toward Macedonia, whose population was regarded by almost all neutral sources as Bulgarian at the time.
The consternation of certain Macedonians with what they saw as the domineering attitude of Northern Bulgarians towards their vernacular was later deftly exploited by the Serbian state, which had begun to fear the rise of Bulgarian nationalism in Macedonia.

Up until 1912/18 it was the standard Bulgarian language that most Macedonians learned (and taught) in the Exarchate schools. All activists and leaders of the Macedonian movement, including those of the left, used standard Bulgarian in documents, press publications, correspondence and memoirs and nothing indicates they viewed it as a foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;''Как пишеха народните будители и герои'', Иван Михайлов&lt;/ref&gt; This is characteristic even of the members of [[IMRO (United)]] well into the 1920s and 1930s, when the idea of a distinct Macedonian nation was taking shape.&lt;ref&gt;Димитър Влахов ''Борбите на македонския народ за освобождение'', Библиотека Балканска Федерация, № 1, Виена; [[Dimitar Vlahov]], "The liberation struggle of the Macedonian people"&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1930s onwards the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Comintern sought to foster a separate Macedonian nationality as a means of achieving autonomy for Macedonia within a Balkan federation. Consequently, it was Bulgarian-educated Macedonians who were the first to develop a distinct Macedonian language, culture and literature.&lt;ref&gt;Доц. д-р Петър Галчин "МАКЕДОНСКИ ЛИТЕРАТУРЕН КРЪЖОК (1938–1941 г.)" ,''Македонски Преглед'', София, бр. 1 &amp; 2, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Юлия Митева, [http://liternet.bg/publish8/iumiteva/ezika.htm "Идеята за езика в Македонския литературен кръжок - естетически и идеологически аспекти"]&lt;/ref&gt; When Socialist Macedonia was formed as part of Federal Yugoslavia, these Bulgarian-trained cadres got into a conflict over the language with the more Serbian-leaning activists, who had been working within the Yugoslav Communist Party. Since the latter held most of the political power, they managed to impose their views on the direction the new language was to follow, much to the dismay of the former group.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S. and R. King, ''Yugoslav Communism and the Macedonian Question'', Archon Books, 1971, p. 137. {{ISBN|0-208-00821-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis P. Hupchick]], American professor of history, states that "the obviously plagiarized historical argument of the Macedonian nationalists for a separate Macedonian ethnicity could be supported only by linguistic reality, and that worked against them until the 1940s. Until a modern Macedonian literary language was mandated by the socialist-led partisan movement from Macedonia in 1944, most outside observers and linguists agreed with the Bulgarians in considering the vernacular spoken by the Macedonian Slavs as a western dialect of Bulgarian".&lt;ref&gt;Dennis P. Hupchick, ''Conflict and Chaos in Eastern Europe'', Palgrave Macmillan, 1995, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1944 the communist-dominated government sought to create a Bulgarian-Yugoslav federation (see [[Balkan Communist Federation]]) and part of this entailed giving "cultural autonomy" to the Pirin region. Consequently, Bulgarian communists recognised the Macedonian language as distinct from Bulgarian.&lt;ref name="Mahon_389_407"&gt;Mahon, M. (1998) "The Macedonian question in Bulgaria" in ''[[Nations and Nationalism (journal)|Nations and Nationalism]]''. Vol. 4, No. 3, pp. 389-407&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Tito-Stalin split]] in 1948, those plans were abandoned. This date also coincided with the first claims of Bulgarian linguists as to the [[Serbianisation]] of the Macedonian language.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, V. (1998) "The implementation of standard Macedonian: problems and results" in ''International Journal of the Sociology of Language''. Issue 131. pp. 31-57&lt;/ref&gt; Officially Bulgaria continued to support the idea of a [[United Macedonia|Macedonian unification]] and a Macedonian nation but within the framework of a Balkan Federation and not within Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer and King, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; However, a reversal in the [[Macedonisation]] policy was already announced in the secret April plenum of the BCP in 1956 and openly proclaimed in the plenum of 1963. 1958 was the first time that a "serious challenge" to the Macedonian position was launched by Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer and King, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; These developments led to violent polemics between Yugoslav and Bulgarian scholars and sometimes reflected on the bilateral relations of the two countries.&lt;ref name="Mahon_389_407"/&gt;

== Macedonian view ==
According to the Macedonian view, now prevalent and official in the books in Republic of Macedonia,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Macedonian was the first official language of the Slavs{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}, thanks to the [[St. Cyril and St. Methodius]]'s introduction of [[Church Slavonic|Slavic literacy language]] through the [[Glagolitic]] script, that was based on Southern Macedonian dialect from the neighbourhood{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} of [[Thessaloniki]], the home of the two saints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056967?query=church%20slavonic%20macedonian&amp;ct= Encyclopædia Britannica - Old Church Slavonic language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221104920/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056967?query=church%20slavonic%20macedonian&amp;ct= |date=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Macedonia fell under the rule of Bulgarians, and the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantines]] regarded all Slavic Macedonians as Bulgarians. According to a minority view, supported in the Republic of Macedonia, [[Tsar Samuil of Bulgaria|Tsar Samuil]]'s realm in the early [[Middle Ages]] was allegedly the first Macedonian Slavic state.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, [[Krste Misirkov]], who allegedly set the principles of the Macedonian literary language in the late 19th century, stated: "We speak a Bulgarian language and we believed with Bulgaria is our strong power."&lt;ref&gt;Misirkov, K. "On the Macedonian Matters", Sofia 1903&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of the Ottoman Empire, Serbia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Greece were all under Ottoman reign. During the nineteenth century, the primary source of identity was religion.&lt;ref name="home.uchicago.edu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friedman|first1=Victor|title=Linguistic Emblems and Emblematic Languages: On Language as Flag in the Balkans|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~vfriedm/Articles/Book003Friedman99.pdf|publisher=Department of Slavic and East European Languages, The Ohio State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Slavs in the geographical regions of Macedonia and Bulgaria were both Orthodox Christian and the Greek Orthodox Church was attempting to Hellenize the population, Macedonian and Bulgarian intellectuals banded together to establish a Slavic literary language in opposition to Greek.&lt;ref name="home.uchicago.edu"/&gt; Two competing centers of literacy rose at the beginning of the nineteenth century: southwestern Macedonia and northeastern Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="home.uchicago.edu"/&gt; These centers were different enough at every linguistic level to be competing to become the literary language. When the Bulgarian Exarchate was recognized as a millet on par with the Greek millet (on religious grounds), the designation Bulgarian was still a religious term, in opposition to Greek, and the language began to be standardized on the basis of the Bulgarian center of literacy.&lt;ref name="home.uchicago.edu"/&gt; Intellectuals from the Macedonian center of literacy felt that their dialects were being excluded from the literary Bulgarian language.&lt;ref name="home.uchicago.edu"/&gt; By the time the Bulgarian state gained independence in 1878, the population of Macedonia and Bulgaria was subjected to conflicting claims from the Serbian, Bulgarian, and Greek states and churches, which provided education, and a distinct Macedonian national identity was written about in print.&lt;ref name="home.uchicago.edu"/&gt; By 1903, a separate Macedonian identity and language is solidified in the works of Krste Petkov Misirkov, who advocates for a distinct Macedonian literary language.&lt;ref name="home.uchicago.edu"/&gt;

== Bulgarian view ==
[[File:Istoria-slavianobolgarskaia.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A page from [[Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya|Slavonic-Bulgarian History]], written in 1762 by Macedonia-born [[Saint Paisius of Hilendar]].]]

Although Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia, most of its academics, as well as the general public, regard the language spoken there as a form of Bulgarian.&lt;ref name="Mahon_389_407"/&gt; However, after years of diplomatic impasse caused by an academic dispute, in 1999 the government in Sofia solved the problem with the Macedonian Language under the formula: "the official language of the country (Republic of Macedonia) in accordance with its constitution".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/199902/90222-005-trae-sof.htm 1999/02/22 23:50 Bulgaria Recognises Macedonian Language]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Bulgarian linguists consider the Slavic dialects spoken in the [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] as a part of the [[Bulgarian dialects|Bulgarian dialect area]].&lt;ref name="unity"&gt;{{cite book |author=Institute of Bulgarian Language |title=Единството на българския език в миналото и днес |publisher=[[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] |year=1978 |page=4 |language=Bulgarian |location=[[Sofia]] |oclc=6430481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoykov"&gt;{{cite book |title=Българска диалектология (Bulgarian dialectology)|last=Стойков (Stoykov)|first=Стойко |authorlink=Stoyko Stoykov |origyear=1962 |year=2002 |location=София |publisher=Акад. изд.

Russian scholars cite the early references to the language in Slavic literature from the middle of 10th century to the end of 19th century as "bulgarski" or "bolgarski" as proof of that claim.&lt;ref name="Strukova1"/&gt; From that, the conclusion is drawn that modern standard Macedonian is not a language separate from Bulgarian either but just another written "norm" based on a set of Bulgarian dialects. See [[dialect]] and [[dialect continuum]] to assess the validity of these arguments.

Moreover, Bulgarian linguists assert that the Macedonian and Yugoslav linguists who were involved in codifying the new language artificially introduced differences from literary Bulgarian to bring it closer to Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/ik/ik_2.html Ив. Кочев и Ив. Александров, ''ДОКУМЕНТИ ЗА СЪЧИНЯВАНЕТО НА МАКЕДОНСКИЯ КНИЖОВЕН ЕЗИК''] {{bg icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also said to have resorted to falsifications and deliberate misinterpretations of history and documents in order to further the claim that there was a consciousness of a separate Macedonian ethnicity before 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Коста Църнушанов, ''Македонизмът и съпротивата на Македония срещу него'', Унив. изд. "Св. Климент Охридски", София, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original aim of the codifiers of Macedonian was to distance it from both Bulgarian and Serbian{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}, Bulgarians today view the standard Macedonian language as heavily Serbianised, especially with regards to its vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=53oBuYEjF9EC&amp;pg=PA187 ''Europe since 1945: an encyclopedia''], Author Bernard A. Cook, Publisher Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8153-4058-3}}, p 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarian scholars such as Kosta Tsrnushanov claim there are several ways in which standard Macedonian was influenced by Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/statii/mp_1991_1_tsyrnushanov.html Сърбизиране на македонския казионен литературен език, сп.

This formulation was detailed in 1978 in a document of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] entitled "The Unity of the Bulgarian Language Today and in the Past".&lt;ref name="Mahon_389_407"/&gt; Although Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of the [[Republic of Macedonia]], it has refused to recognise the existence of a separate Macedonian ethnicity and a separate Macedonian language. This was a major obstacle to the development of diplomatic relations between the two countries until a compromise solution was worked out in 1999.

== Serbian view ==
[[Serbia]] officially recognises the Macedonian Language as separate language to [[Bulgarian Language|Bulgarian]]. In the 2002 census c.26,000 people declared themselves as [[Ethnic Macedonians|Macedonians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/zip/esn31.pdf SN31]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek view ==
From the [[Greece|Greek]] point of view, there can be only one meaning for the term ''Macedonia'', and that is in reference to ancient [[Macedon]] and the modern Greek region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Danforth, L. (1997) The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World (Princeton : Princeton University Press) {{ISBN|0-691-04356-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that the term cannot properly be used for a Slavic language.

Demetrius Andreas Floudas, Senior Associate of [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge]], explains that it was only in 1944 that [[Josip Broz Tito]], in order to increase his regional influence, gave to the southernmost province of [[Yugoslavia]] (hitherto officially known as [[Vardarska banovina]]) the new name of [[People's Republic of Macedonia]]. At the same time, in a "political master-stroke",&lt;ref&gt;Floudas, Demetrius Andreas; {{cite web |publisher= in: Kourvetaris et al. (eds.), ''The New Balkans'', East European Monographs: Columbia University Press, 2002, p. 85 |url=http://www.intersticeconsulting.com/documents/FYROM.pdf | title= Pardon? A Name for a Conflict? FYROM's Dispute with Greece Revisited|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the local language - which was until
then held to be a [[Bulgarian dialects|western Bulgarian]] dialect - was unilaterally christened "Macedonian" and became one of Yugoslavia's official
languages. {{ref|Floudas}} Greece similarly [[Macedonia naming dispute|rejects]] the name "[[Republic of Macedonia]]", seeing it as an implicit territorial claim on the whole of the region.

Books have been published in Greece which purport to expose the artificial character of the Macedonian language.&lt;ref&gt;Roudometof, V. (1996) "Nationalism and Identity Politics in the Balkans: Greece and the Macedonian Question" in ''Journal of Modern Greek Studies'' Vol. 14, pp.&amp;nbsp;253–302.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Greeks believe that the [[Slavic dialects of Greece|Slavic dialects]] spoken in Greek Macedonia are actually a mixture of Slavic and Greek [http://www.uoc.es/euromosaic/web/document/macedoni/fr/i1/i1.html] (''see [[Slavic language (Greece)]]'').

== Other views ==
Linguists outside of Macedonia and Bulgaria subscribe either to a pro-Macedonian or a pro-Bulgarian view.

Illustrating the pro-Macedonian view is [[Horace Lunt]], a [[Harvard]] professor, who wrote the first English language [[grammar]] of the Macedonian language in the early 1950s: "Bulgarian scholars, who argue that the concept of a Macedonian language was unknown before World War II, or who continue to claim that a Macedonian language does not exist look not only dishonest, but silly, while Greek scholars who make similar claims are displaying arrogant ignorance of their Slavic neighbours"; (Lunt 1984:110, 120). Similarly, [[Loring Danforth]], professor of Anthropology at [[Bates College]] in Lewiston, Maine, addresses the stance of linguists, who attribute the origin of the Macedonian language to their will, stressing that all languages in the standardisation process have a certain political and historical context to them and the fact that Macedonian language had a political context in which it was standardised doesn't mean it's not a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/linguafranca/stories/2008/2214064.htm | title = Macedonia and the language of nationalism | accessdate = Nov 8, 2008 | last = Danforth | first = Loring | date = April 12, 2008 | format = radio debate | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illustrating the pro-Bulgarian view, Italian linguist Vittore Pisani stated "the Macedonian language is actually an artifact produced for primarily political reasons".&lt;ref&gt;Pisani, V. "Il Macedonico, Paideia, Rivista Letteraria di informazione bibliografica", vol. 12, p.&amp;nbsp;250, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; German linguist Friedrich Scholz, argues that the Macedonian national consciousness and from that conscientious promotion of Macedonian as a written language, first appears just in the beginning of our century and is strengthened particularly during in the years between the two world wars.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Scholz, ''Slavische Etymologie'', Harrassowitz, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian linguist Otto Kronsteiner, states that the Macedonian linguists artificially introduced differences from the literary Bulgarian language to bring Macedonian closer to Serbian, jesting that the Macedonian language is a Bulgarian one, but written on a Serbian typewriter.&lt;ref&gt;Der Zerfall Jugoslawiens und die Zukunft der makedonischen Literatursprache: Der späte Fall von Glottotomie? Autor Kronsteiner, Otto, Herausgeber Schriftenreihe Die slawischen Sprachen, Erscheinungsjahr 1992, Seiten 142-171.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Power Rangers Samurai'' is the first ''Power Rangers'' season to be shot and broadcast in [[High-definition television|HD]] (''Boukenger'' being the first Super Sentai series to be in HD in Japan, with ''Operation Overdrive'', ''Jungle Fury'' and ''RPM'' using HD footage of the Sentai) and to be airing on Nickelodeon.

Saban announced they would be enacting an "aggressive" multimedia focus, with planned apps, games, streaming content, and social media content in addition to live shows and a feature film.&lt;ref name="licensingbiz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news|title=MarVista to sell 'Rangers' TV library|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118022158.html?categoryid=18&amp;cs=1|accessdate=July 26, 2010|newspaper=Variety|date=July 26, 2010 | first=Cynthia | last=Littleton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The run-up to the new series was promoted by 145 Days of Power Rangers, a daily airing of every ''Mighty Morphin'' episode in order. An official Power Rangers [[Facebook]] page was also created.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/powerrangers Power Rangers Facebook]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 24, 2010, the Power Rangers website placed a trailer for the show online, hosted on [[Yahoo! Kids]]. The new Samurai Rangers also appeared at the 2010 [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-84th-annual-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-is-set-to-feature-new-balloons-amazing-floats-and-a-star-studded-line-up-of-celebrity-performers-106439318.html|title=The 84th Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is Set to Feature New... -- NEW YORK, Nov. 1, 2010 /PRNewswire/ --|accessdate=2010-11-28|date=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the second batch of episodes airing in 2012, Saban began promoting the season with the title of "Super Samurai" to reflect the upgrades to the Rangers powers (glimpsed already in "Clash of the Red Rangers The Movie").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8884">The '''Project of Translation from Arabic''' (or '''PROTA''') is an academic project initiated by Dr [[Salma Khadra Jayyusi]] in 1980 in order to translate, and publish, works of [[Arabic literature]] into the [[English language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/Bulletin/allen.htm "PROTA: The Project for the Translation of Arabic", an essay by Roger Allen (University of Pennsylvania) in the ''Middle East Studies Association Bulletin'', December 1994] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203112248/http://fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/Bulletin/allen.htm |date=2010-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1000peacewomen.org/eng/friedensfrauen_biographien_gefunden.php?WomenID=2093 Salma Jayyusi]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at [[1000 PeaceWomen]]'s official site. Accessed March 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arab Human Development Report]] 2005: Towards the Rise of Women in the Arab World, pg. 104. [[United Nations Development Programme]], [[Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development]] and the Arab Gulf Programme for United Nations Development Organizations.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Eldrige Miller, ''Who's Who in Contemporary Women's Writing'', pg. 156. [[London]]: [[Routledge]], 2001. {{ISBN|0415159806}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated goal of PROTA is ''"the dissemination of Arabic culture and literature abroad."'' The project had its genesis in the late 1970s when [[Columbia University Press]] invited Jayyusi to prepare a large anthology of modern Arabic literature. Funding came from the [[Iraq]]i Ministry of Information and Culture. Two major anthologies came out of this early endeavour: ''Modern Arabic Poetry'' (1987) and ''The Literature of Modern Arabia'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;Jayyusi, "The Arab Laureate," pg. 18. Taken from ''Naguib Mahfouz: From Regional Fame to Global Recognition'', eds. Michael Beard and ʻAdnān Ḥaydar. [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]: [[Syracuse University Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|0815625677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PROTA has published more than 30 titles since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;''Qasida Poetry in Islamic Asia and Africa, Volume 1: Classical Traditions &amp; Modern Meanings'', Introduction, pg. xxxi. Eds. Stefan Sperl and [[Christopher Shackle]]. [[Leiden]]: [[Brill Publishers]], 1996. {{ISBN|9004104526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are anthologies of fiction, poetry and drama, as well as single-author books of poetry, short stories, novellas, and novels. In its first decade, PROTA published works by leading Arab authors such as [[Nizar Qabbani]], [[Ghassan Kanafani]], [[Emile Habîby]], [[Sahar Khalîfah]], [[Ibrâhîm Nasrallâh]], [[Hannâ Mînah]] and [[Zayd Dammâj]]. In 1992, PROTA was joined by another Jayyusi initiative, the East-West Nexus. The Project has since grown from the effort of several academics to a loose network of numerous translators and advisers.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Werner, ''A Bridge of Books''. [[Saudi Aramco World]], January/February 1991 ed., pgs. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two PROTA academics, Salma Jayyusi and Roger Allen, were involved in the proceedings that preceded the awarding of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] to the Egyptian writer [[Naguib Mahfouz]]. A number of other prominent academics have played key roles in translating for the project, including [[Naomi Shihab Nye]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard E. Hishmeh, "The Burden of the Prophet," pg. 107.

}}

In [[broadcasting]], '''public affairs''' [[Radio broadcasting|radio]] or [[television program]]s focus on matters of [[politics]] and [[public policy]].  Among [[commercial broadcaster]]s, such programs are often only to satisfy [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulatory expectations and are not [[Broadcast programming|scheduled]] in [[prime time]].  Public affairs television programs are usually broadcast at times when few listeners or viewers are tuned in (or even awake) in the [[United States|U.S.]], in time slots known as [[graveyard slot]]s; such programs can be frequently encountered at times such as 5-6 a.m. on a Sunday.

Public affairs coverage is carried as [[digital subchannel]]s of existing [[state network]] [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) member [[public television]] stations.

[[Government-access television]] (GATV) is cable [[channel capacity]] for local government bodies and other legislative entities to access the cable television systems to televise public affairs meetings.

At some (particularly national) broadcasters, "Public Affairs" may be a special unit, separate from the news department, dedicated to producing long-form public-affairs programming, as at the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] prior to 1992. As of 2012, [[C-SPAN]]'s three networks are the most widely known and widely available public affairs channels in the United States.

{{For|the Canadian holiday|Civic Holiday}}
A '''public holiday''', '''national holiday''' or '''legal holiday''' is a [[holiday]] generally established by law and is usually a non-working day during the year.

Sovereign nations and territories observe holidays based on events of significance to their history, such as the [[National Day]]. For example, [[Australians]] celebrate [[Australia Day]].

They vary by country and may vary by year. With [[Public holidays in Nepal|36 days a year]], Nepal is the country with the highest number of public holidays but it observes six working days a week. [[India]] ranks second with 21 national holidays, followed by [[Colombia]] and the [[Philippines]] at 18 each. Likewise, [[China]] and [[Hong Kong]] enjoy 17 public breaks a year.&lt;ref name="nepalitimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jha|first1=Manish|title=Regular breaks|url=http://nepalitimes.com/regular-columns/Economic-Class/regular-breaks,788|website=[[Nepali Times]]|accessdate=14 October 2016|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some countries (e.g. Cambodia) with a longer, six-day workweek, have more holidays (28) to compensate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Byrne|first1=Brendan|last2=Hor|first2=Kimsay|title=Can Cambodia stay competitive with so many public holidays?|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/business/can-cambodia-stay-competitive-so-many-public-holidays|accessdate=23 February 2018|work=[[The Phnom Penh Post]]|date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public holidays are generally days of celebration, like the anniversary of a significant historical event, or can be a [[religious holiday|religious celebration]] like [[Diwali]]. Holidays can land on a specific day of the year, be tied to a certain day of the week in a certain month or follow other calendar systems like the [[Lunar Calendar]].

French ''[[Journée de solidarité envers les personnes âgées]]'' (''Day of solidarity with the elderly'') is a notable exception. This holiday became a mandatory working day although the French [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] confirmed it remains a holiday.

==Civic holiday==
A '''civic holiday''', '''civil holiday''' or '''work holiday''' is a day that is [[legal]]ly recognized and celebrated as a [[holiday]] in a particular [[sovereign state]] or [[jurisdiction]]al subdivision of such, e.g., a [[State (administrative division)|state]] or a [[province]].  It is usually a day that the [[legislature]], [[parliament]], [[congress]] or [[Monarch|sovereign]] has declared by [[statute]], [[edict]] or [[decree]] as a non-working day when the official arms of [[government]] such as the [[court|court system]] are closed.   In [[federation|federal states]] there may also be different holidays for the constituent states or provinces, as in the United States where holidays that were established by the federal government are called [[federal holiday|federal holidays]].  Such days may or may not be counted in calculating the [[statute of limitation]]s in legal actions and are usually days when [[child custody|non-custodial]] [[parents]] are given alternating visitation or [[Contact (law)|access]] to their children from a prior [[marriage]] or relationship according to a parenting schedule.

The term may also be used to distinguish between days that may be celebrated as secular holidays rather than religious holidays such as the celebration of New Year's Day on January 1 ([[Gregorian calendar]]) and January 14 ([[Julian Calendar]]) in certain [[eastern Orthodox]] Christian countries such as [[Russia]].

A '''''pyeong'''''&lt;!--foreign text in infobox; see WP:MOS-ZH--&gt; (abbreviation{{nbsp}}'''py''') is a [[Korean unit]] of [[area (mathematics)|area]] and [[floorspace]], equal to a square ''[[kan (unit)|kan]]'' or 36{{nbsp}}square [[Korean feet]]. The '''''ping''''' and '''''tsubo''''' are its equivalent [[Chinese units|Chinese]] and [[Japanese unit]]s, similarly based on a square ''[[bu (unit)|bu]]'' ([[:ja:歩 (尺貫法)|ja:步]]) or ''[[ken (unit)|ken]]'', equivalent to 36{{nbsp}}square [[Chinese feet|Chinese]] or [[Japanese feet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://samo15.netian.com/unit.html|title=Unit conversion chart|date=28 December 2005|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228140325/http://samo15.netian.com/unit.html|archivedate=28 December 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krdic.naver.com/detail.nhn?docid=40441500|title=ko:'평' : 네이버 국어사전|website=Krdic.naver.com|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Pyeong''==
In Korea, the period of [[Japanese occupation of Korea|Japanese occupation]] produced a ''pyeong'' of {{sfrac|400|121}} or 3.3058{{nbsp}}m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is the standard traditional measure for [[real estate]] [[floorspace]], with an average [[house]] reckoned as about 25{{nbsp}}''pyeong'', a [[studio apartment]] as 8–12{{nbsp}}py, and a [[garret]] as 1½{{nbsp}}py. In [[South Korea]], the unit has been officially banned since 1961 but with little effect prior to the criminalization of its commercial use effective 1 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=Gov't to Crack Down on Those Referring to Land as 'Pyeong' |contribution-url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_business/217817.html |date=23 June 2007 |title=The Hankyoreh |location=Seoul |publisher=Hankyoreh Media }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Informal use continues, however, including in the form of real estate use of unusual fractions of meters equivalent to unit amounts of ''pyeong''.

==''Ping''==
In Taiwan, the [[Taiwanese units of measurement|Taiwanese]] ''ping'' remains in fairly common use and is about 3.306{{nbsp}}m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In [[mainland China]], the metrification of traditional units would produce a ''ping'' of 4{{nbsp}}m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but it is almost unknown with most [[real estate]] [[floorspace]] simply reckoned in square meters. The longer length of the [[Hong Kong]] [[Chek (unit)|foot]] produces a larger ''ping'' of almost 5{{nbsp}}m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but it is similarly uncommon.

==''Tsubo''==
In Japan, the usual measure of real estate floorspace is the ''[[tatami (unit)|tatami]]'' and the ''tsubo'' is reckoned as two ''tatami''. The ''tatami'' varies by region but the modern standard is usually taken to be the [[Nagoya]] ''tatami'' of about 1.653{{nbsp}}m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, producing a ''tsubo'' of 3.306{{nbsp}}m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is sometimes reckoned as comprising 10{{nbsp}}[[gō (unit)|gō]].

Lessig founded the [[Creative Commons]] in 2001 which released [[Creative Commons License|License]]s as tools to enable remix culture again, as remixing is legally prevented by the default [[Exclusive right|exclusive]] [[copyright]] regime applied currently on [[intellectual property]]. The remix culture for cultural works is related to and inspired by the earlier [[Free and open-source software]] for software movement, which encourages the reuse and remixing of software works.

The book itself is open for remix&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2009/05/download-lessigs-remix-then-remix-it/ Download Lessig’s Remix, Then Remix It] on [[wired.com]] (May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; due to its availability under a [[CC BY-NC]] license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://remix.lessig.org/remix.php Remix] on lessig.org&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Lawrence Lessig]] described the Remix culture in his 2008 book [[Remix (book)|''Remix'']].  Lawrence compared the default media culture of the 20th century to the usage of [[computer technology]] terminology as '''[[File system permissions|Read/Write]] culture''' ('''RW''') vs. '''[[File system permissions|Read Only]] culture''' ('''RO''').&lt;ref name="lessig2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/larry_lessig_says_the_law_is_strangling_creativity |title=Larry Lessig says the law is strangling creativity |publisher=ted.com |date=2007-03-01 |accessdate=2016-02-26 |author=[[Larry Lessig]] |work=[[TEDx]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the usual ''[[File system permissions|Read Only]]'' media culture, the culture is consumed more or less passively.&lt;ref name="lessig2007" /&gt; The information or product is provided by a 'professional' source, the content industry, that possesses an authority on that particular product/information. There is a one-way flow only of creative content and ideas due to a clear role separation between content producer and content consumer. The emergence of [[Analog signal|Analog]] mass production and duplication technologies (pre-[[Digital revolution]] and [[internet]] like radio broad-casting) inherently enabled the RO culture's business model of production and distribution and limited the role of the consumer to consumption of media.

Digital technology does not have the 'natural' constraints of the analog that preceded it. RO culture had to be recoded in order to compete with the "free" distribution made possible by the Internet. This is primarily done in the form of [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM), which imposes largely arbitrary restrictions on usage. Regardless, DRM has proven largely ineffective in enforcing the constraints of analog media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2015/01/cory-doctorow-a-new-deal-for-copyright/ A New Deal for Copyright] on [[Locus Magazine]] by [[Cory Doctorow]] (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221850/ The Role of Scientific and Technical Data and Information in the Public Domain: Proceedings of a Symposium.] on National Academies Press (US); 15. The Challenge of Digital Rights Management Technologies by Julie Cohen (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Read/Write culture'' has a reciprocal relationship between the producer and the consumer. Taking works, such as songs, and appropriating them in private circles is exemplary of RW culture, which was considered to be the 'popular' culture before the advent of reproduction technologies.&lt;ref name="lessig2007"/&gt; The technologies and copyright laws that soon followed, however, changed the dynamics of popular culture. As it became professionalized, people were taught to defer production to the professionals.

Digital technologies provide the tools for reviving RW culture and democratizing production, sometimes referred to as [[Web 2.0]]. Blogs explain the three layers of this democratization. Blogs have redefined our relationship to the content industry as they allowed access to non-professional, [[user-generated content]]. The 'comments' feature that soon followed provided a space for readers to have a dialogue with the amateur contributors. 'Tagging' of the blogs by users based on the content provided the necessary layer for users to filter the sea of content according to their interest. The third layer added bots that analyzed the relationship between various websites by counting the clicks between them and, thus, organizing a database of preferences. The three layers working together established an ecosystem of reputation that served to guide users through the [[blogosphere]]. While there is no doubt many amateur online publications cannot compete with the validity of professional sources, the democratization of digital RW culture and the ecosystem of reputation provides a space for many talented voices to be heard that was not available in the pre-digital RO model.

== Intertwining of media cultures ==
For remix culture to survive, it must be shared and created by others. This is where [[Participatory culture]] comes into play, because consumers start participating by becoming contributors, especially the many teens growing up with these media cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2005/11/02/57-of-teen-internet-users-create-remix-or-share-content-online/|title=57% of Teen Internet Users Create, Remix or Share Content Online |date=2005-11-02|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book was published in 2013 by [[Henry Jenkins]] called "Reading in a Participatory Culture" which focuses on his technique of remixing the original story [[Moby Dick]] to make it a new and fresh experience for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://henryjenkins.org/2013/02/there-she-blows-reading-in-a-participatory-culture-and-flows-of-reading-launch-today.html |title=There She Blows!

Since media culture consumers start to look at art and content as something that can be repurposed or recreated therefore making them the producer.

== Effects on artists ==
Remix culture has created an environment that is nearly impossible for artists to have or own "[[original work]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fordhamcyberculture.wordpress.com/2014/04/07/remix-culture-its-own-art-form-or-the-death-of-creativity/ |title=Remix Culture: Its Own Art Form or the Death of Creativity? |last=maddysulla |date=2014-04-07|website=Digital Media &amp; Cyberculture|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media and the internet have made art so public that it leaves the work up for other interpretation and, in return, remixing. A major example of this in the 21st century is the idea of [[meme]]s. Once one is put into [[cyberspace]] it is automatically assumed that someone else can come along and remix the picture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/memes-digital-culture Memes in Digital Culture] by Limor Shifman published by [[MIT Press]] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 1974 self-portrait created by artist [[Rene Magritte]], "Le Fils De L'Homme", was remixed and recreated by street artist [[Ron English (artist)|Ron English]] in his piece "Stereo Magritte".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/192640/homages-in-art |title=Remixed Masterpieces: When Artists Pay Homage to Other Artists |date=2011-07-07 |newspaper=Flavorwire |language=en-US |access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyright and Remixing for Disability Services ==
An exemption exists for disability service technology to change copyrighted media to make it accessible to them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapdelaine|first=Pascale|date=2017-11-23|title=The Nature and Function of Exceptions to Copyright Infringement|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198754794.003.0003|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|doi=10.1093/oso/9780198754794.003.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Foundation of the Blind (AFB), American Council of the Blind (ACB) and Samuelson-Glushko Technology Law &amp; Policy Clinic (TLPC) work with U.S. Copyright Office, Library of Congress to renew the exemptions that allow the visually impaired to convert visual texts in copyrighted work into e-readers and other forms of technology that make it possible for them to access. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Crombie|first=David|title=Designing Accessible Music Software for Print Impaired People|date=2008|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-84628-867-8_16|work=Assistive Technology for Visually Impaired and Blind People|pages=581–613|publisher=Springer London|isbn=9781846288661|access-date=2018-11-25|last2=Lenoir|first2=Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; So long as the copyrighted material is obtained in the legal way, the exemption allows for it to be remixed to help to be accessible to anyone disabled. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This exemption extends broadly, including transcribing public broadcasts such as television or radio to be transcribed to braille or visual text if need be. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#121|title=Chapter 1 - Circular 92 {{!}} U.S. Copyright Office|last=Office|first=U.S. Copyright|website=www.copyright.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the proper license, obtained by anyone with a disability that can limit perception, copyrighted material that is obtained legally can be remixed for their understanding. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#112|title=Chapter 1 - Circular 92 {{!}} U.S. Copyright Office|last=Office|first=U.S. Copyright|website=www.copyright.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It has last been renewed in 2012 and continues to stand. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Domains of remixing ==

=== Folklore and vocal traditions ===
[[File:Syrischer Maler von 1354 001.jpg|thumb|An illustration from a 1354 Syrian edition of the [[Panchatantra]], an ancient [[India]]n collection of [[animal fable]]s. The original work is believed to be composed around the 3rd century BCE,&lt;ref name="Jacobs 1888"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jacobs|1888}}, Introduction, page xv; {{Harvnb|Ryder|1925}}, Translator's introduction, quoting Hertel: "the original work was composed in Kashmir, about 200 B.C. At this date, however, many of the individual stories were already ancient."&lt;/ref&gt; based on older oral traditions, including "animal fables that are as old as we are able to imagine".&lt;ref name="i-c-r.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.i-c-r.org.uk/publications/monographarchive/Monograph36.pdf Doris Lessing, ''Problems, Myths and Stories],'' London: Institute for Cultural Research Monograph Series No. 36, 1999, p 13&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Free beer bottles.jpg|thumb|Various "remixed" [[Free Beer]] variants in [[Cooking recipe|recipe]] and label artwork, created since the first release in 2005 under a [[Creative Commons license]].]]
* [[Folklore]] existed long before any copyright law. All [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[folk songs]], [[folk art]], [[folk poetry]], etc. was revised constantly through the [[folk process]]. According to [[Ramsay Wood]],&lt;ref&gt;See page 262 of ''Kalila and Dimna, Selected fables of Bidpai'' [Vol 1], retold by Ramsay Wood, Knopf, New York, 1980; and the Afterword of Medina's 2011 ''Fables of Conflict and Intrigue'' (Vol 2)&lt;/ref&gt; the oldest known example of remix culture is the [[Panchatantra]], an ancient [[India]]n collection of interrelated [[animal fable]]s in verse and prose, arranged within a [[frame story]]. The original [[Sanskrit]] work is believed to be composed around the 3rd century BCE,&lt;ref name="Jacobs 1888"/&gt; based on older [[oral tradition]]s, including "animal fables that are as old as we are able to imagine".&lt;ref name="i-c-r.org.uk"/&gt; The Panchatantra was reinterpreted in the following 2300 years at least 200 times in 50 different languages all around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LHS-rHrE6PEC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22most+frequently+translated%22 Introduction], {{Harvnb|Olivelle|2006}}, quoting {{Harvnb|Edgerton|1924}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryder|1925}}, Translator's introduction: "The Panchatantra contains the most widely known stories in the world. If it were further declared that the Panchatantra is the best collection of stories in the world, the assertion could hardly be disproved, and would probably command the assent of those possessing the knowledge for a judgment."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edgerton|1924|p=3}}. "reacht" and "workt" have been changed to conventional spelling: '"...there are recorded over two hundred different versions known to exist in more than fifty languages, and three-quarters of these languages are extra-Indian. As early as the eleventh century this work reached Europe, and before 1600 it existed in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], German, English, Old Slavonic, [[Czech language|Czech]], and perhaps other [[Slavonic language]]s. Its range has extended from Java to Iceland... [In India,] it has been worked over and over again, expanded, abstracted, turned into verse, retold in prose, translated into medieval and modern vernaculars, and retranslated into Sanskrit. And most of the stories contained in it have "gone down" into the folklore of the story-loving Hindus, whence they reappear in the collections of oral tales gathered by modern students of folk-stories."''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cooking recipe]]s might be among the oldest knowledge of the mankind which was inherited further and shared unrestricted for adaption and improvement. A recent example is the [[Free Beer]] project of [[Superflex]] which has recipe and label artwork under a [[creative commons license]], actively encouraging free adaption and reuse.
* [[Parody|Parodies]] are a form of [[satire]] that adapt another work of [[art]] in order to ridicule it. Parodies date back at least to [[ancient Greek]] times. Parody exists in all art media, including [[literature]], [[music]] and [[film|cinema]].

=== Graphic arts ===
* Remixing in the graphical arts is long known as [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]]. An example for appropriation in [[graphic]]s is the never-ending remix of [[Leonardo Da Vinci]]'s piece [[Mona Lisa]] (see [[Mona Lisa replicas and reinterpretations]] and [[:c:Category:Derivative works of Mona Lisa|Derivative works of Mona Lisa]]). This painting has been reproduced innumerable times with different faces and [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] effects, such as [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s [[L.H.O.O.Q.]]. Some remixed images include [[Photoshopped]] images of the Mona Lisa mixed with [[Mr. Bean]] and an alien-like version.
[[File:Tehranurbanartalone.jpg|thumb|[[Graffiti in Tehran]] by [[a1one]]]]
* [[Graffiti]] is an example of read/write culture where the participants interact with their surroundings and environment. In much the same way that advertisements decorate walls, graffiti allows the public to choose the images to have displayed on their buildings. By using [[Aerosol paint|spray paint]], or other mediums, the artists essentially remix and change the wall or other surface to display their twist or critique. As example, [[Banksy]] is a notable contemporary English graffiti artist.

=== Books and other information ===
[[File:WikimediaMosaicCapture.png|thumb|Wikimedia logo [[mosaic]] to commemorate the one millionth file at Wikimedia Commons. Remixed from the contributed images on the Wikimedia commons.]]
* [[Wikipedia]] is an example of a written remix, where the public is encouraged to add their knowledge in an [[encyclopedia]]. The [[wiki]]-based website essentially allows a user to remix the information presented. [[Amazon.com]] called Wikipedia "the world's most exhaustive and up-to-date encyclopedia" because it is edited and produced by such a large pool of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kindle 3G Wireless Reading Device |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/ref=pe_70020_19681580_pe_00_head/?ASIN=B002FQJT3Q |publisher=Amazon.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804103121/http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reader-3G-Wifi-Graphite/dp/B002FQJT3Q |date=2010-08-04|archivedate=2010-08-04|quote=Wireless Access to Wikipedia Kindle also includes free built-in access to the world's most exhaustive and up-to-date encyclopedia, Wikipedia.org. With Kindle in hand, looking up people, places, events, and more has never been easier. It gives whole new meaning to the phrase walking encyclopedia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scanlation]]s are [[fan-made]] [[translation]]s of [[comics]] from a language into another language.
* [[Mashup (book)|Book mashups]], combining multiple books, received attention in 2009 with [[Seth Grahame-Smith]]'s [[Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]].
* The [[OpenStreetMap]] project creates a [[free content|free]] editable [[map]] of the world,&lt;ref name="tc10"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/09/for-the-love-of-open-mapping-data/ |title=For the Love of Mapping Data |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |last=Lardinois |first=Frederic |date=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over two million registered users who collect data using manual surveys, [[GPS]] devices, [[aerial photography]], and other free sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Neis | first1 = Pascal, | last2 = Zipf | first2 = Alexander,  | title = Analyzing the Contributor Activity of a Volunteered Geographic Information Project&amp;nbsp;— The Case of OpenStreetMap | journal = ISPRS Int.

* The [[Wikimedia Commons]] is digital data repository open for [[free content]] contribution from the public. The content, mostly images and sound files, is licensed under [[Creative Commons license]]s enabling free reuse and remixing by anyone. Another examples are the collaborative image hosting sites [[Flickr]] and [[Deviantart]] who offer Creative commons license options.

=== Software and other digital goods ===


[[Software]] as [[digital good]] is well suited for adaption and remixing.
* Pre-internet [[Public domain software]] of the 1960s and 1970s was software which was shared, edited and improved constantly as [[type-in program]]s. The [[Free and open-source software]] movement can be seen as a kind of successor to those programs.
* In the [[Free and open-source software]] culture, established in the 1990s as opposition to the "Read-only" [[proprietary software]], sharing, [[Fork (software)|forking]] and reusing are natural parts of the development model. For instance, the [[Linux]] [[operating system]], with its commercial offspring [[Android (OS)|Android]] and [[ChromeOS]], is a highly successful result of a software "remix culture".
* The arrival of Internet facing [[Software repository|software repositories]] helped the remix software development model enormously in the 2000s. [[GitHub]] helped since 2008 further the collaborative software development in remix style, especially [[web development]].
* [[Fangames]] are [[video game]]s [[fan labor|made by fans]] based on one or more established [[video game]]s, often acting as a sequel when no official sequel exists.&lt;ref name="derstandard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/2000011074333/Lieblingsspiele-neugemacht-Die-bewundernswerte-Kunst-der-Fan-Remakes|title=Lieblingsspiele 2.0: Die bewundernswerte Kunst der Fan-Remakes|author=Rainer Sigl|publisher=[[Der Standard]]|date=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dōjin soft]] is the Japanese-specific variant, and [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] typically for proprietary hardware consoles.
* [[OverClocked ReMix]] is a community dedicated to [[Digital preservation|preserving]] and paying tribute to [[video game music]] through [[non-commercial]] re-arranging and re-interpreting the songs.
* [[Mod (video gaming)|Video game modding]] is the creative adaption of a released [[video game]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstmonday.org/article/view/2965/2526 Computer game mods, modders, modding, and the mod scene] by Walt Scacchi on [[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]] Volume 15, Number 5 (3 May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s the video game industry noticed the potential and supports often mod makers actively with modding kits. Special cases are [[fan patch]]es, [[server emulator]]s and [[Fan translation of video games]] who made by fans to alleviate [[Bug (software)|bugs]] or shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-11-02-youre-in-charge You're in charge! - From vital patches to game cancellations, players are often intimately involved.] by Christian Donlan on [[Eurogamer]] ''"Supreme Commander fans released Forged Alliance Forever and gave the game the online client it could otherwise only dream of. I haven't played it much, but I still got a tear in my eye when I read about the extents these coders had gone to. There's nothing quite so wonderful to witness as love, and this is surely love of the very purest order. [...] SupCom guys resurrect a series whose publisher had just gone under."'' (2013-11-02)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Machinima]]s are [[fan-made]] videos "remixed" from and with video games, going far beyond the original scope and intend.
* [[Retrocomputing]] and computer and [[digital preservation]] activities as [[Emulator|emulation]] and [[reverse engineering]] were described as aspects of the remixing culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/38392/230.pdf?sequence=4|title=Retrocomputing as Preservation and Remix|authors=Yuri Takhteyev, Quinn DuPont|publisher=[[University of Toronto]]|quote=''This paper looks at the world of retrocomputing, a constellation of largely non-professional practices involving old computing technology. Retrocomputing includes many activities that can be seen as constituting “preservation.” At the same time, it is often transformative, producing assemblages that “remix” fragments from the past with newer elements or joining together historic components that were never combined before. While such “remix” may seem to undermine preservation, it allows for fragments of computing history to be reintegrated into a living, ongoing practice, contributing to preservation in a broader sense. The seemingly unorganized nature of retrocomputing assemblages also provides space for alternative “situated knowledges” and histories of computing, which can sometimes be quite sophisticated. Recognizing such alternative epistemologies paves the way for alternative approaches to preservation.''|date=2013 |format=PDF |accessdate=2016-03-26|work=iConference 2013 Proceedings (pp. 422-432). doi:10.9776/13230}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Household [[3D printing]] heavily relies on remixing as this allows users to repurpose existing designs. Several academic studies have highlighted the importance of remixing for the 3D printing community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flath|first1=C.M.|last2=Friesike|first2=S.|last3=Wirth|first3=M.|last4=Thiesse|first4=F.|title=Copy, transform, combine: exploring the remix as a form of innovation|journal=Journal of Information Technology|date=2017|doi=10.1057/s41265-017-0043-9|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41265-017-0043-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyriakou|first1=H.|last2=Nickerson|first2=J.V.|last3=Sabnis|first3=G.|title=Knowledge Reuse for Customization: Metamodels in an Open Design Community for 3D Printing|journal=MIS Quarterly|date=2017|volume=41|issue=1|pages=315-332|url=http://misq.org/knowledge-reuse-for-customization-metamodels-in-an-open-design-community-for-3d-printing.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanko|first1=M.A.|title=Toward a theory of remixing in online innovation communities|journal=Information Systems Research|date=2016|doi=10.1287/isre.2016.0650}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thingiverse]] is a 3D printing community that allows its users to create, share, and access a broad range of printable digital models. The possibility to remix existing models is the core of this platform. In 2016 [[Microsoft]] started Remix3D.com, a community that is also dedicated to 3D printing models.

=== Music ===

* [[DJing]] is the act of live rearranging and remixing of pre-recorded music material to new compositions. From this music, the term remix spread to other domains.
* [[Arrangement]]s involve taking an already existing melody and reconceptualizing them into a new song. The term "remix" is often used within internet continuities as synonymous with this practice, independent from the original definition of the term "remix" as applied to music. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}
* [[Sampling (music)|Sampling]] in music making is an example of reuse and remix to produce a new work. Sampling is widely popular within [[Hip hop culture|hip-hop]] culture. [[Grandmaster Flash]] and [[Afrika Bambaataa]] were some of the earliest hip-hop artists to employ the practice of sampling. This practice can also be traced to artists such as [[Led Zeppelin]], who interpolated substantial portions of music by many acts including [[Willie Dixon]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Jake Holmes]], and [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ferguson |first=Kirby |title=Everything's A Remix|url=http://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; By taking a small clip of an existing song, changing different parameters such as pitch, and incorporating it into a new piece, the artist can make it their own.
* [[Mashup (music)|Music mashups]] are blends of existing music tracks. The 2004 album ''dj BC presents [[The Beastles]]'' received acclaim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djbc.net/mashes/BCbestof.jpg|title=The sound of surprise: Looking for Boston's best|publisher=[[Boston Phoenix]]|accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=7175|title=Best (and worst) music of 2004|accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured in ''[[Newsweek]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.djbc.net/beastles/newsweekbeastles.jpg |title=Time for your mash-up? |author=N'Gai Croal |publisher=''Newsweek'' |date=March 6, 2006 |accessdate=2008-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927164215/http://www.djbc.net/beastles/newsweekbeastles.jpg |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djbc.net/mashes/beastlesrollingstone.jpg|title=Mash-up corner |author=Brian Hiatt |publisher=''Rolling Stone''|accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second album named ''Let It Beast'' with cover art by cartoonist [[Josh Neufeld]] was produced in 2006.

=== Movies ===
In [[film]], remixing is often done and happens in many forms. 
* Most new movies are adaptations of [[Comic book|comics]], [[graphic novel]]s, [[book]]s, or other forms of media. The majority of other Hollywood cinema works are typically [[Film genre|genre films]] that follow strict generic plots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferguson |first=Kirby |title=Everything's A Remix Part 2 |url=http://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/ |work=Everything's A Remix}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forms of movies hardly appear original and creative, but rather rely on adapting material from previous works or genre formulas, which is a form of remix. A prime example is the film [[Kill Bill]] which takes many techniques and scene templates from other films (predating all this were [[The Magnificent Seven]], an official remake of [[The Seven Samurai]], and Sergio Leone's [[A Fistful Of Dollars]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferguson |first=Kirby |title=Kill Bill Extended Look|url=http://www.everythingisaremix.info/coming-soon/|work=Everything's A Remix}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Video mashup]]s combine multiple pre-existing [[video]] sources with no discernible relation with each other into a unified video. Examples of mashup videos include [[movie trailer]] [[remixes]], [[Vidding|vids]], [[YouTube Poop]], and [[supercut]]s.&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |title=In the matter of exemption to prohibition on circumvention of copyright protection systems for access control technologies |url=https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/2012_dmca_exemption_requests_Final_1.pdf |format=PDF |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/08/04/tech-diary-video-mashups-a-new-kind-of-art/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vidding]] is the [[fan labor]] practice in [[media fandom]] of creating music videos from the footage of one or more visual media sources, thereby exploring the source itself in a new way. The specialized form for animation shows is called [[Anime music video]]s, also made by fans.

* [[Fandub]]s and [[Fansub]]s are reworks of fans on released film material.
* [[Walt Disney]] works are important company remixing examples, for instance [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]], [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]], [[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]. These remixes are based on earlier [[public domain]] works (although Disney films altered from their original sources).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/derekkhanna/2014/02/03/50-disney-movies-based-on-the-public-domain/#429b79e11645 50 Disney Movies Based On The Public Domain] on [[forbes.com]] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://priceonomics.com/how-mickey-mouse-evades-the-public-domain/ How Mickey Mouse Evades the Public Domain] on priceonomics.com (Jan 7, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence Lessig called therefore [[Walt Disney]] a ''"remixer extraordinaire"'' and praised him as ideal of the remix culture in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/lessig_nyed#t-573398 |title=Re-examining the remix |date=2010-04-01 |work=[[TEDx]]NYED |author=[[Lawrence Lessig]] |publisher=ted.com |accessdate=2016-02-27 |quote=Time 9:30: "This man ([[Walt Disney]]) is a Remixer extraordinaire, he is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity." |format=video}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some journalists report that Disney tolerates fan remixes ([[Fan art]]) more than in earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2014/05/23/how_disney_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_copyright_infringement/ How Disney learned to stop worrying and love copyright infringement] on [[salon.com]] by [[Andrew Leonard]] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GIFs ===
[[GIF]]s are another example of remix culture. They are illustrations and small clips from films used for personal expressions in online conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huber|first=Linda|year=2015|title=Culture &amp; the reaction GIF|url=http://www.gnovisjournal.org/2015/02/25/remix-culture-the-reaction-gif/|journal=Gnovis|volume=|pages=|via=Georgetown University}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIFs are commonly taken from an online video form such as film, T.V. or [[YouTube]] videos.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kanai|first=Akane|year=2015|title=Jennifer Lawrence, Remixed: Approaching Celebrity Through DIY Digital Culture|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19392397.2015.1062644?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Celebrity Studies|volume=6|pages=322–340|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each clip usually lasts for about 3 seconds&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and is "looped, extended and repeated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKay|first=Sally|year=2005|title=Affect of Animated GIFs|url=http://www.artandeducation.net/paper/the-affect-of-animated-gifs-tom-moody-petra-cortright-lorna-mills/|journal=Art &amp; Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIFs take a mass media sample and reimagines, or remixes, its meaning from the original context to use it as a form of personal expression in a different context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Angelan|first=|year=|title=Digital Gesture: Rediscovering Cinematic Movement Through GIF|url=http://refractory.unimelb.edu.au/2012/12/29/hagman/#_edn9|journal=Refractory|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used throughout various media platforms but are most popular in [[Tumblr]] where they are used to articulate a punch line.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Remixing in religion ===
Throughout history remix culture has been truthful not only in exchange of oral stories but also through the [[bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://danielmiessler.com/blog/the-bible-is-fiction-a-collection-of-evidence/#gs.Dye1F74|title=The Bible is Fiction: A Collection Of Evidence |date=2007-05-13| newspaper=danielmiessler.com |language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugene H.

== History ==
Remixing was always a part of the human culture.&lt;ref name="WIPO2015"/&gt; US media scholar Professor [[Henry Jenkins]] argued that ''“the story of American arts in the 19th century might be told in terms of the mixing, matching and merging of folk traditions taken from various indigenous and immigrant populations.”'' Another historical example of remixing is [[Cento (poetry)|Cento]], a literary genre popular in [[Medieval Europe]] consisting mainly of verses or extracts directly borrowed from the works of other authors and arranged in a new form or order.&lt;ref name="WIPO2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2015/03/article_0006.html|title=Remix Culture and Amateur Creativity: A Copyright Dilemma |date=June 1, 2015 |accessdate=2016-03-14 |first=Guilda |last=Rostama |publisher=[[WIPO]]|quote=''Most cultures around the world have evolved through the mixing and merging of different cultural expressions.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The balance between creation and consumption shifted with the technological progress on media recording and reproduction. Notable events are the invention of book [[printing press]] and the analog [[Sound recording and reproduction]] leading to severe cultural and legal changes.

=== Analog era ===
In the beginning of the 20th century, on the dawn of the analog [[Sound recording and reproduction]] revolution, [[John Philip Sousa]], an American composer and conductor of the late [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], warned in 1906 in a [[United States Congress|congressional]] hearing on a negative change of the musical culture by the now available "canned music".&lt;ref name="INCREDIBLEBAND"&gt;Bierley, Paul Edmund, "The Incredible Band of John Philip Sousa". [[University of Illinois Press]], 2006. Page 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Lessig, 2008, ''Remix: making art and commerce thrive in the hybrid economy'', London: Bloomsbury Academic. Chapter 1. "These [[phonograph|talking machines]] are going to ruin the artistic development of music in this country. When I was a boy...in front of every house in the summer evenings, you would find young people together singing the songs of the day or old songs. Today you hear these infernal machines going night and day. We will not have a [[vocal folds|vocal cord]] left. The vocal cord will be eliminated by a process of evolution, as was the tail of man when he came from the ape."&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|"These [[phonograph|talking machines]] are going to ruin the artistic development of music in this country. When I was a boy...in front of every house in the summer evenings, you would find young people together singing the songs of the day or old songs. Today you hear these infernal machines going night and day. We will not have a [[vocal folds|vocal cord]] left. The vocal cord will be eliminated by a process of evolution, as was the tail of man when he came from the ape."}}

Specialized, expensive creation devices ("read-write") and specialized cheap consumption ("read-only") devices allowed a centralized production by few and decentralized consumption by many. Analog devices for consumers for low prices, lacking the capability of writing and creating, spread out fast: [[Newspapers]], [[Jukebox]], [[radio]], [[television]]. This new business model, an [[Industrial information economy]], demanded and resulted in the strengthening of the [[exclusive right|exclusive]] [[copyright]] and a weakening of the remix culture and the [[Public domain]] in throughout the 19th and 20th century.

Analog creation devices were expensive and also limited in their editing and rearranging capability. An analog copy of a work (e.g. an [[audio tape]]) cannot be edited, copied and worked on infinite often as the quality continuously worsens. Despite that, a creative remixing culture survived to some limited degree. For instance composer [[John Oswald (composer)|John Oswald]] [[Neologism|coined]] in 1985 the [[Plunderphonics]] term in his [[essay]] ''Plunderphonics, or Audio Piracy as a Compositional Prerogative'' for [[sound collage]]s based on existing [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio recordings]] and altering them in some way to make a new [[musical composition|composition]].

=== Remixing as digital age phenomena ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F077948-0006, Jugend-Computerschule mit IBM-PC.jpg|thumb|[[IBM Personal Computer XT]] in 1988, a digital remixing enabling [[prosumer]] device, affordable for the masses.]]
Technology changed fundamentally with the [[digital revolution]].&lt;ref name="WIPO2015_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2015/03/article_0006.html|title=Remix Culture and Amateur Creativity: A Copyright Dilemma |date=June 1, 2015 |accessdate=2016-03-14 |first=Guilda|last=Rostama |publisher=[[WIPO]] |quote=''In a further twist, widespread access to ever more sophisticated computers and other digital media over the past two decades has fostered the re-emergence of a “read-write” culture.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital information could be reproduced and edited infinitely, often without quality loss. Still, in the 1960s the first digital general computing devices with such capabilities were meant only for specialists and professionals and were extremely expensive; the first consumer oriented devices like [[video game console]]s inherently lacked RW capability. But in the 1980s, the arrival of the [[home computer]] and especially the [[IBM personal computer]] brought a digital [[prosumer]] device, a device usable for production and consumption at the same time, to the masses for an affordable price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joshuawise.com/28c3-transcript The Coming War on General Computation] at 28C3 by [[Cory Doctorow]] (2011-12-30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Prosumption#cite_note-20 Prosumption] by pineight.com&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly for software, in the 1990s the [[free and open-source software]] movement implemented a software ecosystem based on the idea of edit-ability by anyone.

=== Internet and web 2.0 === 
The arrival of the Internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s created a highly effective way to re-implement a "remix culture" in all domains of art, technology and society. Unlike TV and radio, with a [[Unidirectional network|unidirectional]] information transport (producer to consumer), the Internet is inherently [[Duplex (telecommunications)|bidirectional]], enabling a [[peer-to-peer]] dynamic. This accelerated with [[Web 2.0]] and more [[user-generated content]] due to [[Commons-based peer production]] possibilities. Remixes of songs, videos, and photos are easily distributed and created. There is a constant revision to what is being created, which is done on both a professional and amateur scale. The availability of various end-user oriented software such as [[GarageBand]] and [[Adobe Photoshop]] makes it easy to remix. The Internet allows distribution of remixes to the masses. [[Internet meme]]s are Internet-specific creative content which are created, filtered and transformed by the viral spreading process made possible by the web and its users.

=== Foundation of the Creative Commons ===
[[File:Creative commons license spectrum.svg|thumb|300px|[[Creative Commons license]] spectrum between [[public domain]] (top) and [[all rights reserved]] (bottom). On the left side the permitted use cases, on the right side the license components. Remixing is permitted in the two green license groups.]]
As a response to a more restrictive copyright system ([[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension]], [[DMCA]]), which started to limit the blooming sharing and remixing activities of the web, [[Lawrence Lessig]] founded the [[Creative Commons]] in 2001. In 2002 the Creative Commons released a set of [[Creative Commons License|license]]s as tools to enable remix culture, by allowing a balanced, [[fair use|fair]] enabling release of creative works, "some rights reserved" instead of the usual "[[all rights reserved]]". Several companies and governmental organizations adapted this approach and licenses in the following years, for instance [[flickr]], [[DeviantART]]&lt;ref name="da-cc"&gt;{{cite web|title=deviantArt - Creative Commons|url=https://creativecommons.org/2008/06/23/deviantart/|accessdate=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Europeana]] using or offering CC license options which allow remixing. There are several webpages addressing this remix culture, for instance [[ccMixter]] founded 2004.

The 2008 [[open-source film|open-source]] film by [[Brett Gaylor]] [[RiP!: A Remix Manifesto]] documents "the changing concept of [[copyright]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kirsner, Scott. [http://cinematech.blogspot.com/2007/10/cinematech-filmmaker-q-brett-gaylor-of.html "CinemaTech Filmmaker Q&amp;A: Brett Gaylor of Open Source Cinema".] on [[CinemaTech]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinnott, Shane.

Accessed 2008-06-30&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012 [[Canada]]'s [[Copyright Modernization Act]] explicitly added a new exemption which allows non-commercial remixing.&lt;ref name="WIPO2015_4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2015/03/article_0006.html|title=Remix Culture and Amateur Creativity: A Copyright Dilemma |date=June 1, 2015 |accessdate=2016-03-14 |first=Guilda |last=Rostama |publisher=[[WIPO]]|quote=''Canada is one of a few countries, if not the only one, to have introduced into its copyright law a new exception for non-commercial user-generated content. Article 29 of Canada’s Copyright Modernization Act (2012) states that there is no infringement if: (i) the use is done solely for non-commercial purpose; (ii) the original source is mentioned; (iii) the individual has reasonable ground to believe that he or she is not infringing copyright; and (iv) the remix does not have a “substantial adverse effect” on the exploitation of the existing work.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013 the US court ruling [[Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.]] acknowledged that amateur remixing might fall under fair use and copyright holders are requested to check and respect [[fair use]] before doing [[DMCA take down notice]]s.&lt;ref name="WIPO2015_3"/&gt;

== Copyright ==
{{main article|Copyright reform movement}}
Under [[Copyright|copyright laws]] of many countries, anyone with the intent to remix an existing work is liable for lawsuit because the laws protect the [[intellectual property]] of the work. However, current copyright laws are proving to be ineffective at preventing sampling of content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnsen |first=Andres |title=Good Copy, Bad Copy |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4323661317653995812# |accessdate=2011-04-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417142307/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4323661317653995812 |archivedate=2011-04-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2009/06/article_0007.html Is Sampling Always Copyright Infringement?] by Tomasz Rychlicki and Adam Zieliński (November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[fair-use]] does not address a wide enough range of use-cases and its borders are not well established and defined, making usage under "fair use" legally risky. Lessig argues that there needs to be a change in the current state of copyright laws to legalize remix culture, especially for fair-use cases. He states that "outdated copyright laws have turned our children into criminals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Colbert |first=Steven |title=The Colbert Report- Lawrence Lessig |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/215454/january-08-2009/lawrence-lessig |work=The Colbert Report |accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposition is to adopt the system of [[citation]] used with book references. The artist would cite the intellectual property she sampled which would give the original creator the credit, as is common with literature references. As tools for doing so Lawrence Lessig proposed the [[Creative Commons license]]s which demand for instance [[Attribution (copyright)|Attribution]] without restricting the general use of a creative work. One step further is the [[Free content]] movement, which proposes that creative content should be released under [[free license]]s. The [[Copyright reform movement]] tries to tackle the problem by cutting for instance the excessive long [[copyright terms]], as it was debated by scholar [[Rufus Pollock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate=21 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221124708/http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_over_time.pdf |url=http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |format=PDF |title=Optimal copyright over time: Technological change and the stock of works |author=Rufus Pollock |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |date=1 October 2007 |accessdate=11 January 2015 |quote=The optimal level for copyright has been a matter for extensive debate over the last decade. Using a parsimonious theoretical model this paper contributes several new results of relevance to this debate. In particular we demonstrate that (a) optimal copyright is likely to fall as the production costs of 'originals' decline (for example as a result of digitization) (b) technological change which reduces costs of production may imply a decrease or a decrease in optimal levels of protection (this contrasts with a large number of commentators, particularly in the copyright industries, who have argued that such change necessitates increases in protection) (c) the optimal level of copyright will, in general, fall over time as the stock of work increases. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate=12 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112152530/http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |url=http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |format=PDF |title=Forever minus a day?

Based on a novel approach we derive an explicit formula which characterises the optimal term as a function of a few key and, most importantly, empirically-estimable parameters. Using existing data on recordings and books we obtain a point estimate of around 15 years for optimal copyright term with a 99% confidence interval extending up to 38 years. This is substantially shorter than any current copyright term and implies that existing terms are too long.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other (copyright) scholars, such as [[Yochai Benkler]] and Erez Reuveni,&lt;ref&gt;Erez Reuveni, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1113491 "Authorship in the Age of the Conducer"], [[Social Science Research Network]], January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; promulgate ideas that are closely related to remix culture in 2007. Some scholars argue that the academic and legal institutions must change with the culture towards one that is remix based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selber |first=Stuart |title=Plagiarism, Originality, Assemblage |journal=Computers &amp; Composition |date=December 2007 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=375–403 |doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2007.08.003 |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;hid=9&amp;sid=3a6cebb4-a52a-405e-b7de-988e33e905c0%40sessionmgr10&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=27755744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 [[Cato Institute]]'s [[Julian Sanchez (writer)|Julian Sanchez]] praised the remix activities for its social value, ''"for performing social realities"'' and remarked that copyright should be evaluated regarding the ''"level of control permitted to be exercised over our social realities"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/lessig_nyed#t-573398 |title=Lawrence Lessig: Re-examining the remix |date=2010-04-01 |work=[[TEDx]]NYED |author=[[Julian Sanchez (writer)|Julian Sanchez]] |publisher=ted.com |accessdate=2016-02-27 |quote=Time 7:14: ''"social remixes [...] for performing social realities"''; 8:00 ''"copyright policies about [...] level of control permitted to be exercised over our social realities"'' |format=video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZ06Kwbi5s The Evolution of Remix Culture] by [[Julian Sanchez (writer)|Julian Sanchez]] (2010-02-05)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Copy-transform-combine-scheme.svg|thumb|300px|Ferguson's description of the creative process for all original ideas — copy, transform, and combine&lt;ref name="copytransformcombine"/&gt; — presented in a 2011 TED talk.&lt;ref name="FergusonTED"/&gt;]]
According to [[Kirby Ferguson]] in 2011 and his popular [[TED talk]] series,&lt;ref name="FergusonTED"&gt;[http://story2023.nextrends.swissnexsanfrancisco.org/thoughts-on-remix-culture-copyright-and-creativity/ THOUGHTS ON REMIX CULTURE, COPYRIGHT, AND CREATIVITY] by Melanie Picard (August 6, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; everything is a remix, and that all original material builds off of and remixes previously existing material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ferguson |first=Kirby |title=Everything's A Remix|url=http://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/ |work=Everything Is A Remix Part 1 |accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues if all intellectual property is influenced by other pieces of work, copyright laws would be unnecessary. Ferguson described that, the three key elements of creativity — copy, transform, and combine — are the building blocks of all original ideas; building on [[Pablo Picasso]]'s famous quote "Good artists copy, great artists steal.".&lt;ref name="copytransformcombine"&gt;[https://lifehacker.com/the-three-key-steps-to-creativity-copy-transform-and-1561711228 The Three Key Steps to Creativity: Copy, Transform, and Combine] by Eric Ravenscraft on [[lifehacker.com]] (2014-10-04)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 [[UC Davis]] professor Thomas W.

In June 2015 a [[WIPO]] article named ''"Remix Culture and Amateur Creativity: A Copyright Dilemma"''&lt;ref name="WIPO2015_3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2015/03/article_0006.html|title=Remix Culture and Amateur Creativity: A Copyright Dilemma |date=June 1, 2015 |accessdate=2016-03-14 |first=Guilda |last=Rostama |publisher=[[WIPO]]|quote=''in 2013 a district court ruled that copyright owners do not have the right to simply take down content before undertaking a legal analysis to determine whether the remixed work could fall under fair use, a concept in US copyright law which permits limited use of copyrighted material without the need to obtain the right holder’s permission (US District Court, Stephanie Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., Universal Music Publishing Inc., and Universal Music Publishing Group, Case No. 5:07-cv-03783-JF, January 24, 2013).[...] Given the emergence of today’s “remix” culture, and the legal uncertainty surrounding remixes and mash-ups, the time would appear to be ripe for policy makers to take a new look at copyright law.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledged the "age of remixing" and the need for a [[Copyright reform movement|copyright reform]].

'''''Resident Evil 7: Biohazard'''''{{efn|Stylized as RESIDENT E'''VII'''. biohazard, known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Biohazard 7: Resident Evil'''''|バイオハザード7 レジデント イービル|Baiohazādo 7 Rejidento Ībiru|lead=yes|extra=stylized as ''BIOHA'''7'''.ARD resident evil''}}}} is a [[survival horror|survival horror game]] developed and published by [[Capcom]], released in January 2017 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]], and in May 2018 for the [[Nintendo Switch]] in Japan. Diverging from the more action-oriented ''[[Resident Evil 5]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 6]]'', ''Resident Evil 7'' returns to the franchise's survival horror roots, emphasizing exploration. The player controls [[Ethan Winters]] as he searches for his wife in a derelict plantation occupied by a cannibal family, solving puzzles and fighting enemies. It is the first main series game to use a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] view.

''Resident Evil 7'' is the first full-length game to use Capcom's in-house RE Engine. The development was led by Koshi Nakanishi, director of the 2012 [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations]]''. It was presented as a [[virtual reality]] demo, ''Kitchen,'' a year prior to its announcement at [[E3 2016]], and supports the [[PlayStation VR]] headset. ''Resident Evil 7'' was considered a return to form for the series; critics praised the gameplay, graphics, and design, but criticized the [[boss battles]] and the final chapter. The PlayStation VR version received positive reviews, with some criticism including decreased resolution and physical discomfort. By March 2018, the game had sold over five million copies worldwide. Its initial release was followed by two [[downloadable content|downloadable]] scenarios, ''Not a Hero'' and ''End of Zoe''.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Resident Evil 7 gameplay.png|thumb|left|Using a handgun in combat]]

The player controls [[Ethan Winters]] from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] perspective as he searches the Baker house for his missing wife.&lt;ref name="ethan" /&gt; Although Ethan is a civilian with few combat skills,&lt;ref name="eurogamer" /&gt; he is able to arm himself with a variety of different weapons including [[handgun]]s, [[shotgun]]s, [[flamethrower]]s, [[Explosive material|explosives]] and [[chainsaw]]s&lt;ref name="chainthrowers" /&gt; against the Baker family and a humanoid form of [[fungus]] known as the "Molded". He can also block attacks to reduce damage. Various sections of the game are spent being pursued by members of the Baker family, who if engaged in combat, can only be temporarily incapacitated. However, these encounters are avoidable by means of stealth, or running away.&lt;ref name="umbrella" /&gt;&lt;ref name="immortal" /&gt;

Unlike ''[[Resident Evil 5]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 6]]'', the gameplay emphasizes horror and exploration over action.&lt;ref name="eurogamer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="healing play" /&gt; The inventory uses a grid-based system with an initial capacity of 12 slots, but may be expanded several times over the course of the game. An item can occupy up to two spaces, and four items may be assigned to the [[D-pad]]. Item boxes found in [[Saved game|save]] rooms may also be used to manage and store items, and can be retrieved from different item boxes for later use.&lt;ref name="umbrella" /&gt;&lt;ref name="item boxes" /&gt; Items in the inventory can be used, examined, or combined with other items to increase their usefulness.&lt;ref name="survival" /&gt; Many of the game's puzzles require that items be examined under certain conditions in order to reveal secrets.&lt;ref name="imagination" /&gt; [[Tape recorder]]s can be used to manually save the game's progress, which, depending on the given difficulty level, may require the use of a [[cassette tape]].&lt;ref name="umbrella" /&gt;&lt;ref name="recorder" /&gt; [[VHS|Videotape]]s are scattered for Ethan to find, which place the player in the perspective of a different character, often revealing plot information or clues needed to solve a puzzle.&lt;ref name="umbrella" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGUS" /&gt; The PlayStation 4 version is playable in [[virtual reality]] using the [[PlayStation VR]] headset.&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt;

== Plot ==
In 2017, Ethan Winters is drawn to a derelict [[plantation]] in Dulvey, [[Louisiana]], by a message from his wife, Mia, who has been presumed dead for three years. He finds Mia imprisoned in the basement of a seemingly abandoned house, but she becomes violent and attacks him, forcing him to kill her. After receiving a call from a woman named Zoe offering assistance, Ethan is attacked by a revived Mia, who cuts his hand off. Jack, the patriarch of the Baker family, captures Ethan. After Zoe reattaches his hand, Ethan is held captive by Jack, his wife Marguerite, their son Lucas, and an elderly woman who  is using a wheelchair and is in a catatonic state. Ethan escapes but is pursued around the house by Jack, who has powerful regenerative abilities. In the basement, Ethan discovers reanimated monsters known as Molded. Zoe reveals that she is Jack's daughter, and that the family and Mia are infected, but can be cured with a special serum. Ethan makes his way to an old house to retrieve the serum ingredients, kills Marguerite, and has visions of a young girl. Lucas captures Zoe and Mia and forces Ethan to navigate a booby-trapped barn to find them. Ethan chases away Lucas and frees Zoe and Mia. Zoe develops two serum doses, but they are attacked by Jack, now heavily mutated; Ethan kills him using one of the serums.&lt;ref name="umbrella" /&gt;

Ethan must choose to cure either Mia or Zoe. Choosing Zoe leaves Mia heartbroken, despite Ethan's promise to send help. As he and Zoe flee on a boat, Zoe reveals that the Bakers were infected after Mia arrived with a young girl named Eveline when the wreck of a tanker ship washed ashore. Eveline stops their escape by psychically killing Zoe, and Ethan is knocked from the boat by a creature. If Ethan chooses Mia, Zoe gives a bitter farewell to him and Mia. As he and Mia flee on a boat, they come across the crashed tanker, where they are attacked by the creature and knocked from the boat. Mia searches the wrecked ship for Ethan while experiencing visions of Eveline, who refers to Mia as her mother. Eventually, Mia's memory is restored, revealing that she was a covert operative for a corporation that developed Eveline as a [[Biological agent|bioweapon]].&lt;ref name="umbrella" /&gt;

Mia and another agent were to escort Eveline as she was transported aboard the tanker; Eveline escaped containment, killed Mia's colleague, and sank the ship. She infected Mia in an effort to force her to be her mother. Mia finds Ethan and gives him a vial of Eveline's genetic material. If Ethan cured Mia, she resists Eveline's control long enough to seal Ethan out of the ship; if he cured Zoe, Mia succumbs to Eveline's control and attacks Ethan, forcing him to kill her. Ethan discovers a hidden laboratory inside an abandoned salt mine. He learns that Eveline is a bio-organic weapon capable of infecting people with a psychotropic mold that gives her control over her victims' minds, resulting in insanity, mutation, and superhuman regenerative abilities. Eveline grew up obsessed with having a family, driving her to infect Mia and the Bakers and lure Ethan. Lucas was immunized against Eveline's control by her creators, The Connections, in exchange for providing observations on her. Using the lab equipment and Eveline's genetic material, Ethan synthesizes a toxin to kill her, and proceeds through tunnels that lead back to the Baker house. He overcomes Eveline's hallucinations, and injects Eveline with the toxin. She reverts to her other form, the elderly woman in a wheelchair; Eveline has been rapidly aging since escaping. Eveline mutates into a large monster and, aided by the arrival of a military squad led by [[Chris Redfield]], Ethan kills her. The squad extracts Ethan (and Mia if she was cured) by helicopter branded with the [[Umbrella Corporation]] logo.&lt;ref name="umbrella" /&gt;

===''Not a Hero''===
[[Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance|BSAA]] agent Chris Redfield teams up with the now reformed Umbrella Corporation in order to apprehend Lucas Baker and uncover evidence on the mysterious group that created Eveline, called "The Connections". After rescuing Ethan Winters and sending him away on a helicopter, Chris proceeds into Lucas' lab in the salt mine, where he accidentally runs into one of Lucas' traps and has a bomb attached to his left wrist. Undeterred, Chris continues his pursuit. He tries to rescue several captured Umbrella soldiers, but they are killed by Lucas' traps. Eventually, Lucas decides to activate a timer on Chris' bomb. Chris is forced to freeze the bomb in [[liquid nitrogen]], disabling it long enough for him to remove it. 

With the bomb removed, Chris battles his way through more of Lucas' Molded and traps. He then finds his way into a secret Connections research lab, where Lucas had killed all of the Connections researchers and plans to betray the organization. Chris manages to corner and shoot Lucas, which triggers a mutation in his body. Chris battles and eventually kills the mutated Lucas, and also stops him from transferring all of his data on Eveline to the Connections. With his mission done and Eveline's infection contained, Chris returns to the Umbrella base camp for an urgent call.

===''End of Zoe''===
Following the path in the main game in which Ethan cures Mia instead of Zoe, Zoe wanders into the swamp and is apparently killed by Eveline; however, a pair of Umbrella soldiers find her body and discover she is still alive. They are soon ambushed by Joe Baker, Zoe's uncle. Joe initially believes Umbrella is responsible for Zoe's condition, but a surviving Umbrella soldier claims they have a cure for Zoe stored in a nearby shack. Joe goes to the shack, finding a partial cure, and returns to find the Umbrella soldier killed by a Molded.

Joe initially flees with Zoe on a boat to find the Umbrella base but is soon forced to search for the base on foot. A powerful and seemingly unkillable Molded called the "Swamp Man" pursues them along the way. Joe and Zoe find the Umbrella base abandoned. They learn that the cure has been moved to a nearby paddle boat. Joe boards the boat and, after encountering the Swamp Man once again, uncovers a full dose of the cure. The Swamp Man captures Zoe before Joe can administer the cure. Joe gives chase into a heavily infected portion of the swamp and finds Zoe in an abandoned church. Inside, Joe is ambushed by the Swamp Man, who reveals himself to be Jack Baker, Joe's brother. Jack knocks Joe unconscious and throws him into the swamp water to die.

Joe eventually washes up near the Baker mansion and finds himself in the midst of a battle between the Molded and Umbrella forces. He recovers an Umbrella power [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]] and enters the mansion, where he successfully kills Jack and administers the cure to Zoe just as Umbrella reinforcements arrive, including Chris Redfield. Chris assures Joe and Zoe that they are there to help, and Zoe is fully cured of her infection. She then receives a phone call from Ethan, and thanks him for keeping his promise to send help for her.

== Development ==
[[File:RE Engine logo.jpg|thumb|160px|''Resident Evil 7'' debuted the use of the RE Engine in a full-length video game.]]

Following the release of ''Resident Evil 6'', Capcom conducted internal discussions regarding the direction of the next installment. A preliminary version of the game, developed in 2013, featured a more action-oriented gameplay, similar to that of ''Resident Evil 6''. Taking inspiration from the 1981 film ''[[The Evil Dead]]'', the developers decided to scale back the game to one location and use a first-person perspective to immerse players and return the series to its roots of [[survival horror]].&lt;ref name="polygon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=re7-2013/&gt; Development began around February 2014.&lt;ref name="famitsu" /&gt; The game is built on a new [[Game engine|engine]], named RE Engine, which includes [[Virtual reality#Video games|virtual reality (VR)]] development tools.&lt;ref name="PR" /&gt; The decision to make the game first-person was made well before VR was considered;&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; VR development started in October 2015, for which a separate team was created.&lt;ref name="g4m45utr4" /&gt; The introduction of VR demanded that textures be more detailed, discarding [[Texture (visual arts)|flat textures]] and inaccurate object sizes that had previously been used.&lt;ref name="flat" /&gt; 

A year before the game's announcement, Capcom presented to attendants of [[E3 2015]] a first-person horror-themed VR demo, ''KITCHEN'', which ran on the same engine.&lt;ref name="PR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalspy" /&gt; While ''Resident Evil 7'' had been in development long before, ''KITCHEN'' was seen as an opportunity to evaluate how the RE Engine and its VR capabilities would be received.&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; As a hint to the demo's relation to ''Resident Evil 7'', the logo of ''KITCHEN'' had the letter "T" designed so that it resembled a "7", but it went largely unnoticed.&lt;ref name="famitsu" /&gt; In the company's Integrated Report of 2015, the ''Resident Evil'' development division of Capcom was stated to focus on creating experiences for the VR market, which included the new VR engine and games for the [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|eighth generation of consoles]].&lt;ref name="dd1" /&gt;

The game was directed by Koshi Nakanishi, who previously helmed ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations]]'', leading a development team numbering at about 120 staff.&lt;ref name="polygon" /&gt; For the first time in the series, the narrative designer was a westerner—Richard Pearsey, writer of the two expansion packs of ''[[F.E.A.R.]]'' and one of the narrative designers of ''[[Spec Ops: The Line]]''.&lt;ref name="pearsey" /&gt; At the time of the game's reveal, development was around 65% complete.&lt;ref name="famitsu" /&gt; Some of the creature models in ''Resident Evil 7'' were first created in physical form – a number of them from actual meat – by [[make-up artist]]s, to then be scanned through the employment of [[photogrammetry]]. This technology developed over half of the general assets of the game, but posed a problem in researching the setting of Louisiana because its considerable demand for equipment made it unviable for transport, which required Capcom to model by hand.&lt;ref name="photogrammetry" /&gt; The game's score was composed by Capcom's lead composer Akiyuki Morimoto, Miwako Chinone, and Satoshi Hori, with additional contributions from [[Cris Velasco]] and Brian D'Oliveira.&lt;ref name="vgmo" /&gt; Its theme song, an arranged version of the traditional American folk song "Go Tell Aunt Rhody", was written by [[Michael A. Levine]] and performed by [[Jordan Reyne]]. Levine's step-daughter Mariana Barreto was the original choice, but ended up doing the background vocals. The song went through about 20 versions until completion.&lt;ref name="background" /&gt; A soundtrack was released digitally by [[Sumthing Else Music Works]] alongside the game on January 24.&lt;ref name="vgmo" /&gt;

== Release and marketing ==
In October 2016, [[Capcom]] launched a 10 part video series called ''The World of Resident Evil 7'', teasing pieces of the game's contents.&lt;ref name="NAEUJP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gameplay" /&gt; A cross-save feature between Microsoft Windows and the Xbox One was confirmed in November 2016.&lt;ref name="crossbox one" /&gt; If bought on either PC through the Windows Store or on the Xbox One digitally, it is playable on both platforms through the Xbox Play Anywhere program,&lt;ref name="anywhere" /&gt; making it the first game published by a third-party to be a part of the program.&lt;ref name="third-party" /&gt; A cloud version for the [[Nintendo Switch]], titled ''Biohazard 7: Resident Evil Cloud Version'', was released in Japan on May 24, 2018. Players may access the first 15 minutes of the game for free, and continue playing it afterwards by purchasing a pass allowing unlimited play for 180 days.&lt;ref name="Cloud" /&gt;

The internal marketing team at Capcom collaborated with creative agency iam8bit to produce an [[escape room]] called ''Resident Evil Escape Room Experience'', in which groups of six are guided through a series of rooms by [[Umbrella Corporation]] employees. It was held at a gallery space in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="evil umbrella" /&gt; In [[London]], a similar event was hosted in concurrence with the release.&lt;ref name="concurrence" /&gt;

Purchase of a [[GameStop]]-exclusive Collector's Edition included an eight-inch model of the Baker mansion, which when opened functions as a [[music box]] playing the main theme rendition of "Go Tell Aunt Rhody", a [[mannequin]] finger-shaped 4&amp;nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] [[USB flash drive]] contained within a [[VHS]] tape box, a [[Steelbook|SteelBook Case]] containing the game, a [[lithograph]] of the Baker family, and a note.&lt;ref name="eight-inch mannequin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vhs finger" /&gt; The UK version added the Survival Pack: Action Set DLC, a 20th anniversary artbook and a seven-inch replica of the mansion, but did not feature the music box.&lt;ref name="20th survival" /&gt; U.S. pre-orders on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One came with a code for a free digital download of ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution]]''.&lt;ref name="restitution" /&gt; A [[digital scent technology|4D candle]] with the scent of the Baker House Mansion was made to enhance the virtual reality experience.&lt;ref name="digital scent technology" /&gt; The Gold Edition, released on December 12, 2017, includes previously released [[downloadable content]] (DLC) as well as the upcoming ''End of Zoe'' DLC.&lt;ref name="Hood-2017" /&gt;

''Resident Evil 7: Biohazard'' was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand on January 24, 2017, and in Japan on January 26.&lt;ref name="NAEUJP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="turnleft"/&gt; For the first 12 months of its release, the [[virtual reality]] format is exclusive to [[PlayStation VR]].&lt;ref name="psvr" /&gt; Over 3,500,000 players have accumulated worldwide, with over 400,000 of them being VR users.&lt;ref name="worldVR" /&gt; The PC version was [[Tamper resistance|tamper-protected]] by anti-piracy software [[Denuvo]], which was hacked within five days of release.&lt;ref name="denuvo" /&gt;

=== Playable demonstrations ===
Shortly after the game's reveal, a playable teaser named ''Resident Evil 7 Teaser: Beginning Hour'' was released on the [[PlayStation Store]].&lt;ref name="PR" /&gt; The demo takes place in a dilapidated house, which the unnamed male player character needs to escape.&lt;ref name="2 times" /&gt; Depending on the actions taken by the player, the teaser may have three different outcomes.&lt;ref name="dilapidated" /&gt; Capcom later revealed that the teaser was a standalone experience and not a segment of the game, which has more variety in its environments, and additional mechanics, such as combat.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="such final" /&gt; By July 2016, the demo had been downloaded over 2 million times.&lt;ref name="downloaded" /&gt; An update called the "Twilight Version" was released on September 15, 2016, and gave access to new rooms and items to find.&lt;ref name="twilight" /&gt; Along with the new version, Capcom also released a trailer for the game. Another update called the "Midnight Version" was released on December 3, which unlocked additional areas of the house, along with several new items to find and a puzzle concerning a riddle in the Twilight Version.&lt;ref name="capcum" /&gt; The demo was released for Xbox One on December 9 and for PC on December 19.&lt;ref name="xbox hour" /&gt;

A playable demo called ''Lantern'' was made available for attendees at [[Gamescom#2016|Gamescom 2016]], as part of revealing the first ''Resident Evil 7'' [[Trailer (promotion)#Video game trailers|story trailer]]. It makes use of [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] and [[first-person narrative]] as it tells the story of a young woman by the name of Mia hiding from an agitated old lady holding a lantern. The old lady is Marguerite Baker, who was first mentioned in ''Beginning Hour''.&lt;ref name="agitated" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mia" /&gt;

=== Downloadable content ===
The first downloadable content package for the game, ''Banned Footage Vol. 1'', was released for the PlayStation 4 on January 31, 2017. ''Banned Footage Vol. 1'' includes two scenarios, called "Nightmare" and "Bedroom", and a new game mode, "Ethan Must Die".&lt;ref name="DLC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="banned" /&gt; On February 14, ''Banned Footage Vol. 2'' was released for the PlayStation 4, which includes two additional scenarios, called "21" and "Daughters", and a new game mode, "Jack's 55th Birthday". ''Banned Footage Vol. 1'' and ''Banned Footage Vol. 2'' were released for the Xbox One and PC on February 21.&lt;ref name="jack's daughters" /&gt; ''Not a Hero'' – a story chapter where players control [[Chris Redfield]],&lt;ref name="chris" /&gt; which was delayed from its Q2 2017 release date,&lt;ref name="not a hero" /&gt;&lt;ref name="delayed" /&gt; was released for free, on December 12, 2017, along with a new DLC called ''End of Zoe'', that came out the same day.&lt;ref name="Hood-2017" /&gt; While ''End of Zoe'' was developed by Capcom, development duties for ''Not a Hero'' were outsourced to [[HexaDrive]].&lt;ref name="HexaDrive" /&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Pre-release ===
Due to its first-person presentation, the game has drawn comparisons to [[Konami]]'s cancelled ''[[Silent Hills]]'' game and its ''[[P.T. (video game)|P.T.]]'' demo. Capcom responded to this by pointing out that ''Resident Evil 7'' was in development long before the reveal of ''P.T.'',&lt;ref name="P.T.S.D." /&gt; and dispelled any rumors about staff of ''P.T.'' having been hired to work on the game.&lt;ref name="dispelled" /&gt; ''[[Shacknews]]'' noted that ''Beginning Hour'' had several similarities with ''[[Sweet Home (video game)|Sweet Home]]'' (1989), the Capcom horror game that inspired the original ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' (1996). These similarities to ''Sweet Home'' include the plot of a film crew going to an abandoned house, a paranormal female presence in the house, and a tragic tale involving a family that once lived there.&lt;ref name="sweet home" /&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]'' found the element of survival horror in ''Lantern'' reminiscent of ''[[Alien: Isolation]]''.&lt;ref name="agitated" /&gt; ''Resident Evil 7'' was well received for the dissimilarity to its polarizing predecessor, in particular the change from [[Action-adventure game|action-oriented]] combat and effects to an approach more grounded in horror.&lt;ref name="dissimilarity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="maligned" /&gt;

The game received generally favorable reviews according to [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCXONE"/&gt; ''Resident Evil 7'' was included in numbered lists of the best video games in 2017: 5th place for "Best Horror Game" and 6th place in the 25 Best Games list at ''[[GamesRadar+]]''&lt;ref name="gamesradar5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GRadar-Top25" /&gt; and 5th place at ''[[Business Insider]]''.&lt;ref name="business insider" /&gt; ''[[Vulture.com]]'' also listed the game among the best video games of the year.&lt;ref name="Vulture-2017" /&gt; ''[[PlayStation Official Magazine – UK]]'' listed it as the fourth best PlayStation VR game.&lt;ref name="PTOMUK" /&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked the game third on their list of the "Best Games of 2017",&lt;ref name="EW-2017" /&gt; ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' ranked it fifth on their list of the 50 best games of 2017,&lt;ref name="Poly-2017" /&gt; and ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGMNow]]'' ranked it seventh on their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017,&lt;ref name="EGMNow-Top25" /&gt; while ''[[Eurogamer]]'' ranked it 14th on their list of the "Top 50 Games of 2017".&lt;ref name="EuroG-Top50" /&gt; Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw of ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' listed it as his favorite game of 2017,&lt;ref name="Escapist-Top5" /&gt; and ''[[The Verge]]'' named it as one of their 15 Best Games of 2017.&lt;ref name="TheVerge-Top15" /&gt; In ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Reader's Choice Best of 2017 Awards, the game came in the lead for "Best VR Game",&lt;ref name="GIReadersChoice" /&gt; also giving it the award for "Best VR Action" in their 2017 Action Game of the Year Awards.&lt;ref name="GI-Action" /&gt;

''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Zack Furniss felt that the primary accomplishment of ''Resident Evil 7'' concerned its pacing, which was praised as "masterful". Furniss' apprehensive expectations of how the story would unfold were subverted to his liking, deeming the result a blend similar to the horror and comedy found in ''The Evil Dead'' films. He found a sense of finality in the combat and lauded it for having produced lasting tension. What held more sway, however, was the priority of survival horror, with the management of limited resources meeting a positive response. Furniss considered the [[boss fight]]s to be "harrowing" and welcomed the consistent surreality of the game. His playthrough with the PlayStation VR inspired unease, unpredictable [[jump scare]]s and ultimately an "intuitive" experience.&lt;ref name="Destruct" /&gt; Ray Carsillo of ''EGMNow'' favored the atmosphere's constant mood of anxiety, which was partly impacted by the interiors of the main setting. The [[sound design]] was also thought to complement this sense of dread, increasing the level of player involvement. He noted the slow narrative build as the game's most substantial achievement, and likened its efficacy to that of earlier games in the series. Like Furniss, Carsillo expressed appreciation for the pacing, and opined that it brought considerable intrigue, accommodating lengthy play sessions. Playing with the virtual reality headset was "even more frightening than doing it normally", according to Carsillo, echoing Furniss' view that it made the game more immersive.&lt;ref name="EGM" /&gt; Writing for ''Game Informer'', Andrew Reiner commended the "tense, unsettling, overly gory" atmosphere for providing a competent introduction to ''Resident Evil 7''. The Baker house and the nature of exploring it posed significant interest to him, for together, they would present new aspects regarding the occupants and be enhanced by the first-person perspective.&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt; Scott Butterworth at ''[[GameSpot]]'' enjoyed the narrative overall, valuing its memorable moments and the thematic consistency of the writing. He was impressed with the reliance of atmosphere as opposed to jump scares to heighten the feeling of danger. Using the Baker family to multifarious ends of gameplay was complimented as a logical extension of the established world; the interactive VHS tapes were approved of for the same reason, said to serve "beautifully as both a narrative device and a way to break up Ethan's exhausting mission". On PlayStation VR, Butterworth mentioned that, in its employment, the element of horror appeared more realistic.&lt;ref name="GSpot" /&gt;

Leon Hurley, writing for ''GamesRadar+'', was of the opinion that, while the "gore and guts" were sparingly effective, a number of his most favorite moments had to do with investigating the "beautifully designed" Baker house. As for the VR, it was dubbed as a terrifying experience "where the mildewy atmosphere gets into your soul".&lt;ref name="GRadar" /&gt; ''[[Giant Bomb]]''{{'}}s Dan Ryckert referred to ''Resident Evil 7'' as the reinvigoration of earlier components in the series while at the same time yielding a fresh outlook with a yet-unrivaled story. The main antagonists bore substantial weight to Ryckert's cause for worry, and gave way to thrills when prompted to flee them. He viewed the first-person perspective as "bold", and attributed to the PlayStation VR, an earnest addition to the "scare factor".&lt;ref name="GB" /&gt; Chloi Rad of ''[[IGN]]'' endorsed the pervading tone of eeriness in the game, owed entirely to the plantation, which she thought was "one of the creepiest single settings since the [[Spencer Mansion]]". Also, she observed that the game world gave off a robust [[sense of place]] with unwavering exploration. To her, the Baker family were the most compelling of the characters because of the consequent emotional strain felt in their presence.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; Andy Kelly at ''[[PC Gamer]]'' began his review, writing, "It's a return to the atmospheric, slow-burning horror of the original". He disagreed with Ryckert's assessment that the first-person was a bold reinvention, instead praising it for being "classic ''Resident Evil'' through and through". Kelly saw the regular state of vulnerability he was faced within the game as one of its greatest strengths, giving credit to the visuals and audio for adding to the "rumbling sense of dread". He considered flashbacks via VHS tapes to be one of his favorite features.&lt;ref name="PCGUS" /&gt; ''Polygon''{{'}}s Philip Kollar applauded ''Resident Evil 7''{{'}}s return to form, declaring that "no ''Resident Evil'' game since the first has done as good a job as ''RE7'' at making me feel scared and helpless".&lt;ref name="Poly" /&gt;

Conversely, Furniss observed the boss fight and ending as disappointing. He also cited issues with the PlayStation VR, including the prospect of sacrificing graphics for improved aim and immersion, as the resolution would decrease while in virtual reality.&lt;ref name="Destruct" /&gt; Carsillo disliked the inventory system because its restricted capacity left weaponry and ammunition with the same amount of space as other items critical to story progression.&lt;ref name="EGM" /&gt; The lack of character development for the protagonist Ethan Winters was disparaged as well, with Reiner stating that the plot suffered flaws of inconsistency from this approach. Also subject to criticism was the required body movements while in seated VR mode, which were described as stomach-churning.&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt; Butterworth felt a loss of excitement by the end, blaming the repetition of certain assignments to be carried out. He faulted enemies for exerting less of a threat than was preferred in the given difficulty level. Unlike with other platforms, Butterworth detected inferior visual performance on the Xbox One with degraded colors and textures.&lt;ref name="GSpot" /&gt; Hurley expressed disapproval of the decision one comes across near the end of the game, calling into question its relevance by arguing that it could be quickly resolved in the event of regret.&lt;ref name="GRadar" /&gt; Rad criticized ''Resident Evil 7'' for its dependence on "overplayed tropes about rural America" which would eventually resemble a cartoon, and the puzzles were appraised as the sole shortcoming of the setting.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; Kollar accused boss battles of interrupting the inherent suspense.&lt;ref name="Poly" /&gt;

The game won the Gold Prize, User's Choice Prizes, and the PlayStation VR Special Award at the PlayStation Awards.&lt;ref name="PlayStationAwards" /&gt;  It was also nominated for "Best Setting" in ''PC Gamer''{{'}}s 2017 Game of the Year Awards,&lt;ref name="PCGamerNom" /&gt; and won the award for "Best VR Game" in ''Destructoid''{{'}}s Game of the Year Awards 2017.&lt;ref name="Destructoid-GOTY" /&gt; It also won the People's Choice Award for "Best VR Experience" for which it was a runner-up in ''IGN''{{'}}s Best of 2017 Awards;&lt;ref name="IGNAwards2017D" /&gt; its other nominations were for "Best Xbox One Game", "Best PlayStation 4 Game", "Best Action/Adventure Game", and "Best Graphics".&lt;ref name="IGNAwards2017A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNAwards2017B" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNAwards2017C" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNAwards2017E" /&gt;

=== Sales ===
Capcom's pre-release sales projection for the game's launch window, through the end of March 2017, was 4 million copies.&lt;ref name="sales cap" /&gt; The game had shipped over 2.5 million units worldwide days after the release, while the demo exceeded 7.15 million downloads.&lt;ref name="worldwide days" /&gt; The modest shipment figure had an effect on Capcom's [[stock price]], which fell more than three percent following the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name="stock price" /&gt; It was the best-selling video game in the UK during its week of release according to [[Chart-Track]], amounting to the third-best debut in ''Resident Evil'' history behind ''[[Resident Evil 5|5]]'' (7.1 mill) and ''[[Resident Evil 6|6]]'' (6.6 mill). 200,000 copies had also been sold through [[Steam (software)|Steam]] during that time.&lt;ref name="stock price" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chart-track" /&gt;&lt;ref name="third-best" /&gt; It ranked first in the Japanese charts for the week ending January 29; the PS4 sales totalled 187,306 copies,&lt;ref name="japanese charts" /&gt; 58.9 percent of its initial shipment.&lt;ref name="fifty eight" /&gt; In the month of January in the United States, ''Resident Evil 7'' sold the most out of any video game.&lt;ref name="moj" /&gt; On February 1, Capcom communicated to its investors that the game had recouped its budget.&lt;ref name="budget" /&gt; It remained at the top of the UK sales chart in its second week.&lt;ref name="second week" /&gt;   February saw ''Resident Evil 7'' ranked the second best-selling video game in the United States, behind ''[[For Honor]]''.&lt;ref name="february" /&gt; By April 2017, ''Resident Evil 7'' had sold 3.5 million copies worldwide, short of Capcom's expectation of 4 million.&lt;ref name="eurogamer2" /&gt; In May 2017, Capcom gave the game a lifetime sales forecast of ten million units, citing favorable reviews, marketing and downloadable content as contributing factors.&lt;ref name="lifetime" /&gt; By September 2018, total sales reached 5.7 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/finance/million.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Mapplethorpe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|p|əl|ˌ|θ|ɔr|p}}; November 4, 1946 – March 9, 1989) was an American [[photographer]], known for his sensitive yet blunt treatment of controversial subject-matter in the large-scale, highly stylized black and white medium of photography. His work featured an array of subjects, including celebrity portraits, male and female [[Nude (art)|nudes]], self-portraits and still-life images of flowers. His most controversial work is that of the [[BDSM]] subculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s of [[New York City]].  The [[homoeroticism]] of this work fuelled a national debate over the public funding of controversial artwork.

==Biography==
Mapplethorpe was born in [[Floral Park, Queens]], New York City, the son of Joan Dorothy (Maxey) and Harry Irving Mapplethorpe, an electrical engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1701327|title=Mapplethorpe, Robert|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was of [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Germans|German]] descent, and grew up as a [[Roman Catholic]] in Our Lady of the Snows Parish. He had three brothers and two sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/04/robert-mapplethorpe-bad-boy-with-a-camera/|title=Robert Mapplethorpe: bad boy with a camera|work=The Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied for a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] from the [[Pratt Institute]] in [[Brooklyn]], where he majored in Graphic Arts,&lt;ref&gt;Glueck, Grace. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DE1E3EF936A15755C0A963958260 "Fallen Angel"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 25, 1995. Accessed October 14, 2007. "Growing up in a blue-collar precinct of Floral Park and steeped in Catholicism, Mapplethorpe developed&amp;nbsp;— to his alarm&amp;nbsp;— an adolescent interest in [[gay]] [[pornographic]] magazines&amp;nbsp;... So, at Pratt Institute, where his father had studied Engineering and Robert majored in Graphic Arts (but stopped short of getting a degree)&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; though he dropped out in 1969 before finishing his degree.&lt;ref&gt;Haggerty, George. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L9Mj7oHEwVoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Gay%20histories%20and%20cultures%3A%20an%20encyclopedia%20%20By%20George%20E.%20Haggerty&amp;pg=PA561#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Gay histories and cultures"]&lt;/ref&gt; Mapplethorpe lived with his close friend [[Patti Smith]] from 1967 to 1972, and she supported him by working in bookstores. They created art together, and maintained a close relationship.

[[File:Gene Frankel Theater 24 Bond Street.jpg|thumb|right|Mapplethorpe's studio at 24 [[Bond Street (Manhattan)|Bond Street]] in [[Manhattan]], later kept by him for use as a darkroom]]

Mapplethorpe took his first photographs in the late 1960s or early 1970s using a [[Polaroid camera]]. In 1972 he met art curator [[Sam Wagstaff]] who would become his mentor and lifetime companion.  In the mid-1970s Wagstaff acquired a [[Hasselblad]] medium-format camera and Mapplethorpe began taking photographs of a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, including artists, composers, and socialites.  During this time, he became friends with [[New Orleans]] artist [[George Dureau]], whose work had such a profound impact on Mapplethorpe that he restaged many of Dureau's early photographs.  From 1977 until 1980, Mapplethorpe was the lover of writer and [[Drummer Magazine (leather)|''Drummer'' magazine]] editor [[Jack Fritscher]],&lt;ref&gt;Jack Fritscher, ''Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer'', San Francisco, Palm Drive Publishing, 2008, {{ISBN|1890834386}}, p. 473, [http://www.jackfritscher.com/PDF/Drummer/Vol%201/33_Mineshaft_Mar2008_PWeb.pdf Jackfritscher.com], retrieved September 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; who introduced him to [[Mineshaft (gay club)|Mineshaft]].

By the 1980s Mapplethorpe's subject matter focused on statuesque male and female nudes, delicate flower still lifes, and highly formal portraits of artists and celebrities.  Mapplethorpe's first studio was at 24 [[Bond Street (Manhattan)|Bond Street]] in Manhattan.  In the 1980s, Wagstaff bought a top-floor loft at 35 West 23rd Street for Robert, where he resided, also using it as a photo-shoot studio.&lt;ref name=Morrisroe&gt;Morrisroe, Patricia. Robert Mapplethorpe: a biography. New York: Random House, 1995. pgs. 297, 126 {{ISBN|0-394-57650-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He kept the Bond Street loft as his darkroom.  In 1988, Mapplethorpe selected Patricia Morrisroe to write his biography, which was based on more than 300 interviews with celebrities, critics, lovers, and Mapplethorpe himself.&lt;ref name=Morrisroe/&gt;

===Death===
Mapplethorpe died on the morning of March 9, 1989 at the age of 42 due to complications from [[HIV/AIDS]], in a [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] hospital.  His body was cremated.  His ashes are interred at [[St. John Cemetery (Queens)|St. John's Cemetery, Queens]] in [[New York City|New York]], at his mother's grave-site, etched "Maxey".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

=== Foundation ===
Nearly a year before his death, the ailing Mapplethorpe helped found the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation, Inc.  His vision for the Foundation was that it would be "the appropriate vehicle to protect his work, to advance his creative vision, and to promote the causes he cared about".&lt;ref name="mfoundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapplethorpe.org/foundation.html|title=The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation - Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since his death, the Foundation has not only functioned as his official estate and helped promote his work throughout the world, but has also raised and donated millions of dollars to fund medical research in the fight against AIDS and HIV infection and to promote fine art photography at the institutional level.&lt;ref name="mfoundation" /&gt; The Foundation also determines which galleries represent Mapplethorpe's art.&lt;ref name="Duray2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Duray|first=Dan|title=Mapplethorpe Estate to OHWOW in Los Angeles|url=http://galleristny.com/2013/11/mapplethorpe-estate-to-ohwow/|work=Observer.com|publisher=The New York Observer|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation - FAQ|url=http://www.mapplethorpe.org/faq/|work=mapplethorpe.org|publisher=The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation donated the Robert Mapplethorpe Archive, spanning from 1970 to 1989, to the [[Getty Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Mapplethorpe Archive|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/special_collections/notable/mapplethorpe.html|publisher=Getty Research Institute|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==

Mapplethorpe worked primarily in a studio, and almost exclusively in black and white, with the exception of some of his later work and his final exhibit "New Colors". His body of work features a wide range of subjects, but his main focus and the greater part of his work is erotic imagery. He would refer to some of his own work as [[pornographic]],&lt;ref name=Morrisroe /&gt; with the aim of arousing the viewer, but which could also be regarded as [[high art]].&lt;ref name=Whitney&gt;Arthur Coleman Danto and Mapplethorpe, Robert. Mapplethorpe. New York: Random House, 1992.

Mapplethorpe was a participant observer for much of his erotic photography, participating in the sexual acts which he was photographing and engaging his models sexually.&lt;ref name=Whitney/&gt;

Other subjects included flowers, especially orchids and [[Zantedeschia aethiopica|calla lilies]], children, statues, and celebrities and other artists, including [[Andy Warhol]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]], [[Kathy Acker]], [[Richard Gere]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Amanda Lear]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Philip Glass]], [[David Hockney]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Joan Armatrading]] and [[Patti Smith]]. Smith was a longtime roommate of Mapplethorpe and a frequent subject in his photography, including a stark, iconic photograph that appears on the cover of Smith's first album, ''[[Horses (album)|Horses]]''.&lt;ref name=bestcovers&gt;{{cite book |title=100 Best Album Covers: The Stories Behind the Sleeves |last=Thorgerson |first= Storm |author2=Aubrey Powell  |edition=1st American |date=November 1999 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=0-7894-4951-X |pages=74 |ref=https://books.google.com/books?id=71kBAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work often made reference to religious or classical imagery, such as a portrait of Patti Smith &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/visualarts/Image-Library/Mapplethorpe/tate_photo-patti-smith-1975.jpg Georgetown.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; from 1986 which  recalls [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s 1500 self-portrait.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/visualarts/Image-Library/Exempla/durer-self-portrait-1500-lg.jpg Georgetown.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1980 and 1983, Mapplethorpe created over 150 photographs of bodybuilder [[Lisa Lyon]], culminating in the 1983 photobook ''Lady, Lisa Lyon'', published by [[Viking Press]] and with text by Bruce Chatwin.

{{quote|text=Robert took areas of dark human consent and made them into art. He worked without apology, investing the homosexual with grandeur, masculinity, and enviable nobility. Without affectation, he created a presence that was wholly male without sacrificing feminine grace. He was not looking to make a political statement or an announcement of his evolving sexual persuasion. He was presenting something new, something not seen or explored as he saw and explored it. Robert sought to elevate aspects of male experience, to imbue homosexuality with mysticism.

==Controversy==

===''The Perfect Moment'' (1989 solo exhibit tour)===
In the summer of 1989, Mapplethorpe's traveling solo exhibit brought national attention to the issues of public funding for the arts, as well as questions of censorship and the obscene. The [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., had agreed to be one of the host museums for the tour. Mapplethorpe decided to show his latest series that he explored shortly before his death. Titled ''Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment'', the show included photographs from his X Portfolio, which featured images of [[urophagia]], [[BDSM]] and a self-portrait with a [[bullwhip]] inserted in his anus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V110/N31/mapple.31a.html|title=Robert Mapplethorpe's extraordinary vision - The Tech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was curated by Janet Kardon of the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia|Institute of Contemporary Art]] (ICA).&lt;ref name=ICA&gt;[http://www.icaphila.org/news/pdf/mapplethorpe_pr.pdf ''Imperfect Moments: Mapplethorpe and Censorship Twenty Years Later'', Institute of Contemporary Art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icaphila.org/exhibitions/mapplethorpe.php|title=ICA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICA was awarded a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to support Mapplethorpe's exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. The cancellation of the show, which terminated the Corcoran's contract with the ICA, was due to the fact that the museum did not want to get involved in the politics. Instead, the Corcoran was pulled into the controversy, which "intensified the debate waged both in the media and in Congress surrounding the NEA's funding of projects perceived by some individuals... to be inappropriate..."&lt;ref&gt;Tannenbaum, Judith. "Robert Mapplethorpe: The Philadelphia Story." Art Journal 50.4 (1991): 71-76. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy of the Corcoran and several members of [[United States Congress|the U.S. Congress]] were upset when the works were revealed to them, due to the [[homoerotic]] and [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] themes of some of the work. Though much of his work throughout his career had been regularly displayed in publicly funded exhibitions, conservative and religious organizations, such as the [[American Family Association]], seized on this exhibition to vocally oppose government support for what they called "nothing more than the sensational presentation of potentially obscene material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DC153FF934A2575BC0A966958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Mapplethorpe's Photos Now an F.C.C. Issue | date=August 17, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1989, [[pop art]]ist [[Lowell Blair Nesbitt]] became involved in the censorship issue. Nesbitt, a long-time friend of Mapplethorpe, revealed that he had a $1.5-million bequest to the museum in his will, but publicly promised that if the museum refused to host the exhibition, he would revoke the bequest. The Corcoran refused and Nesbitt bequeathed the money to the [[Phillips Collection]] instead. After the Corcoran refused the Mapplethorpe exhibition, the underwriters of the exhibition went to the nonprofit [[Washington Project for the Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v47/no2/fitzpat.html ''The Sensitive Society'', James F. Fitzpatrick, FCLJ Vol 47 No 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613072721/http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v47/no2/fitzpat.html |date=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which showed all the images in its space from July 21 to August 13, 1989, to large crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73897099.html?dids=73897099:73897099&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Sep+6%2C+1989&amp;author=Judd+Tully&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=b.01&amp;desc=Corcoran+Cut+From+Painter%27s+Will%3BLowell+Nesbitt%27s+Mapplethorpe+Protest|title=Corcoran Cut From Painter's Will|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpadc.org/catalyst/?p=2845|title=Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1990, the [[Contemporary Arts Center]] in Cincinnati, and [[Dennis Barrie]], were charged with obscenity. They were found not guilty by a jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackfritscher.com/OtherAnthology/CensorshipEncyclopedia.html|title=Censorship: A World Enclyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ICA, "The Corcoran's decision sparked a controversial national debate: Should tax dollars support the arts? Who decides what is "obscene" or "offensive" in public exhibitions? And if art can be considered a form of [[free speech]], is it a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to revoke federal funding on grounds of obscenity? To this day, these questions remain very much at issue."&lt;ref name=ICA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The federal government and the states have long been permitted to limit obscenity or pornography. However, the exact definition of obscenity and pornography has changed over time. (See also [[I know it when I see it]].)&lt;/ref&gt;  Mapplethorpe became something of a [[wikt:cause célèbre|cause célèbre]] for both sides of the American [[culture war]]. However, prices for many of the Mapplethorpe photographs doubled and even tripled as a consequence of all the attention. The artist's notoriety supposedly also helped the posthumous sale at [[Christie's]] auction house of Mapplethorpe's own collection of furniture, pottery, silver and works by other artists, which brought about $8 million.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck (April 16, 1990), [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/16/arts/publicity-is-enriching-mapplethorpe-estate.html Publicity Is Enriching Mapplethorpe Estate] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Central England incident===
In 1998, the [[Birmingham City University|University of Central England]] was involved in a controversy when a book by Mapplethorpe was confiscated. A final-year undergraduate student was writing a paper on the work of Robert Mapplethorpe and intended to illustrate the paper with a few photographs from ''Mapplethorpe'', a book of the photographer's work. She took the photographs to the local chemist to be developed and the chemist informed West Midlands Police because of the unusual nature of the images. The police confiscated the library book from the student and informed the university that the book would have to be destroyed. If the university agreed to the destruction, no further action would be taken.

The university Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Peter Knight, supported by the Senate, took the view that the book was a legitimate book for the university library to hold and that the action of the police was a serious infringement of academic freedom. The Vice-Chancellor was interviewed by the police, under caution, with a view to prosecution under the terms of the [[Obscene Publications Acts]].

After the interview with the Vice-Chancellor, a file was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service for a determination by the Director of Public Prosecutions whether to proceed with a trial. After a delay of about six months, the affair came to an end when Dr. Knight was informed by the DPP that no action would be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ |title=UCE pages on the Mapplethorpe controversy |accessdate=2002-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990209055420/http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ |archivedate=February 9, 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Black Book''===
The 1986 solo exhibition "Black Males" and the subsequent book ''The Black Book'' sparked controversy for their depiction of black men. The images, erotic depictions of black men, were widely criticized for being exploitative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queerculturalcenter.org/Pages/Mappleth/MappPg1.html|title=Mapplethorpe - Richard Meyer Essay|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/arts/mapplethorpe_r.html Mapplethorpe, Robert (1946-1989)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321074911/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/mapplethorpe_r.html |date=2006-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kobena Mercer "Looking for Trouble" Transition, No. 51 (1991), pp. 184-197&lt;/ref&gt; The work was largely [[Phallus|phallocentric]] and sculptural, focusing on segments of the subject's bodies. His purported intention with these photographs and the use of black men as models was the pursuit of the [[Platonic ideal]].&lt;ref name=Morrisroe /&gt; Mapplethorpe's initial interest in the black male form was inspired by films like ''[[Mandingo (film)|Mandingo]]'' and the interrogation scene in ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]],'' in which an unknown black character enters the interrogation room and slaps the protagonist across the face.&lt;ref&gt;Fritscher, Jack. Mapplethorpe: assault with a deadly camera : a pop culture memoir, an outlaw reminiscence. Mamaroneck, NY: Hastings House, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism was the subject of a work by American conceptual artist [[Glenn Ligon]],'' Notes on the Margins of the Black Book'' (1991–1993). Ligon juxtaposes Mapplethorpe's 91 images of black men in the 1988 publication ''Black Book'' with critical texts and personal reactions about the work to complicate the racial undertones of the imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Audio Guide Stop For Glenn Ligon, Notes on the Margins of the Black Book, 1991-1993, [http://whitney.org/WatchAndListen/Artists?context=&amp;context_id=&amp;play_id=376 Whitney Museum of American Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

American poet and activist [[Essex Hemphill]] also expressed criticism in his anthology ''Brother to Brother'' (1991). Although he believed that Mapplethorpe's work reflected exceptional talent, Hemphill also believed that it displayed a lack of concern for black individuals in the gay community, "except as sexual subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin (2014). ''Hold Tight Gently: Michael Callen, Essex Hemphill and the Battlefield of AIDS''. New York: [[The New Press]]. pp. 169-170. {{ISBN|978-1-59558-945-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumously==
In 1992, author [[Paul Russell (novelist)|Paul Russell]] dedicated his novel ''Boys of Life'' to Mapplethorpe, as well as to Karl Keller and [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Paul|title=Boys of Life|year=1991|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0525933274|page=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''Mapplethorpe: A Biography'' by Patricia Morrisroe was published by Random House in 1995,&lt;ref name=Morrisroe/&gt; the ''Washington Post Book World'' described it as "Mesmerizing... Morrisroe has succeeded in re-creating the photographer's world of light and dark."&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post Book World, May 28, 1995, ''In the Darkroom of the Soul''.&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic [[Arthur Danto|Arthur C. Danto]], writing in ''The Nation'', praised it as "utterly admirable... The clarity and honesty of Morrisroe's portrait are worthy of its subject."&lt;ref&gt;''The Unretouched Life'', The Nation, June 12, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Patti Smith]] wrote a book ''[[The Coral Sea (book)|The Coral Sea]]'' dedicated to Mapplethorpe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Patti|title=The Coral Sea|year=1996|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York, NY|isbn=0393039080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philips]] released a photo disc for their [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] video game system in the late 1990s called ''The Flowers of Robert Mapplethorpe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Flowers of Robert Mapplethorpe (CD-i) James &amp; Mike Mondays|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECVdnmjrfyc|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1999, Arena Editions published ''Pictures,'' a monograph that reintroduced Mapplethorpe's sex pictures. In 2000, ''Pictures'' was seized by two [[South Australian]] plain-clothes detectives from an [[Adelaide]] bookshop in the belief that the book breached indecency and [[obscenity|obscenity laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extract from: HANSARD, S.A. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Wednesday 14 March 2001|url=https://www.efa.org.au/Publish/samapplethorpe.html|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Police sent the book to the [[Canberra]]-based [[Australian Classification Board|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] after the state Attorney-General's Department deftly decided not to get involved in the mounting publicity storm. Eventually, the OFLC board agreed unanimously that the book, imported from the United States, should remain freely available and unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pictures (book), Australian Classification,|url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Pages/View.aspx?sid=F%252f37FixyCCJcNEJG4I%2b02g%253d%253d&amp;ncdctx=JDFqlp0uaVsihc3foKMDfEhVT6%2b2q3UflUkULkMQKD8SlYvwJ2n1ovo%252fFwAGtion|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, American writer, director, and producer [[James Crump]] directed the documentary film [[Black White + Gray (2007 film)|''Black White + Gray'']], which premiered at the 2007 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].

She may or may not play a major role in the story, but typically is “everything female.” Some examples that Pollitt cites include the mother figure, a “glamour queen,” or a female sidekick of sorts.&lt;ref name="hers" /&gt; As a consequence, works employing this [[Trope (literature)|trope]] often fail the [[Bechdel test]], an indicator of gender bias in fiction.{{quote|Contemporary shows are either essentially all-male, like "[[Garfield]]", or are organized on what I call the Smurfette principle: a group of male buddies will be accented by a lone female, stereotypically defined... The message is clear. Boys are the norm, girls the variation; boys are central, girls peripheral; boys are individuals, girls types. Boys define the group, its story and its code of values. Girls exist only in relation to boys.}}This term continues to be used in discourse to describe not only "preschool culture," but also popular media from the last 40 years.

== Origin ==
Pollitt observed this as what she thought of in terms of a common media practice while shopping for her daughter’s Christmas toys. The initial use of the term was in relation to “preschool culture,” that to Pollitt, would hinder a child’s understanding of gender. She goes further to say, “The sexism in preschool culture deforms both boys and girls. Little girls learn to split their consciousness, filtering their dreams and ambitions through boy characters while admiring the clothes of the princess.”&lt;ref name="hers" /&gt;

== Recent developments ==
In 2011 Pollitt discussed her term again in ''[[The Atlantic]]''. She said that the issue is still highly prevalent in the current media. She specifically cited the then major blockbuster, ''[[Super 8 (2011 film)|Super 8]]'', which had only one female main character (played by [[Elle Fanning]]). Also at this time, she extended the principle to include television networks. The only major anchor in the MSNBC lineup in 2011, according to Pollitt was [[Rachel Maddow]]. She said, "there's one Rachel Maddow, and then there's that whole male lineup. There's Ed [Schultz], there used to be Keith [Olbermann], and Lawrence O'Donnell, and now there's going to be Al Sharpton. It's quite remarkable that there's only this one woman, and it's never equal."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This term has not disappeared by any means, making many appearances in popular literature and discourse. Journalists complain that major blockbusters that will turn out millions of dollars, include only one female, and this trend is not fading anytime soon.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/movies/the-smurfette-principle-why-can%E2%80%99t-hollywood-accept-gender-equality/ar-BBGz820?li=AA5a2k|title=The Smurfette Principle: why can’t Hollywood accept gender equality?|website=www.msn.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is visible in ensemble movie posters, like with [[Ocean's Eleven|''Ocean's Eleven'']], [[The Matrix|''The Matrix'']] and [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4616798/movie-posters-single-woman/|title=This Is the Disturbing Movie Poster 'Smurfette Principle'|last=TIME|website=Time|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Rose looks at Eleven’s situation in the TV show ''[[Stranger Things]]'', where she is essentially replaced (while on her own adventures) by Max, another young girl, who is also teased, then “lusted after,” another common reaction to a lone female character.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The “Smurfette,” or sole female cast member, has been understood to typically have a stereotypical role of a romantic partner, a “brooding badass,” or exists to deflate the tension of an all-male cast.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

As a result of the discontent about the lack of women, a new pattern has emerged, of “gender-inversion,” casts of exclusively female actresses, like ''[[Ocean's 8|Ocean’s 8]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]''.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tn2magazine.ie/smurfette-principle/|title=The Smurfette Principle|date=2017-08-25|work=TN2 Magazine|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media|Geena Davis Institute]] found that only “10% of all films have a gender balanced cast,” thus reinforcing the existence of the lack of fair female representation, i.e. the Smurfette Principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seejane.org/symposiums-on-gender-in-media/gender-bias-without-borders/|title=Gender Bias Without Borders - See Jane|work=See Jane|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In an article and video for ''Bitch Magazine'', [[Anita Sarkeesian]] asserts that the reoccurrence of this issue is that media from the 1980s and 1990s is continuously being remade, which still typically adhere to this principle, creating an ongoing cycle. She also called on the film industry to include more female characters, or even a female dominated cast, ''and'' pass the [[Bechdel test]]. After these are kept in mind and actually accomplished, meaningful diversity will be possible.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://feministfrequency.com/video/tropes-vs-women-3-the-smurfette-principle/|title=Tropes vs. Women: #3 The Smurfette Principle|date=2011-04-21|work=Feminist Frequency|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses in scholarship ==
Rickie Solinger, in a review of some of Pollitt’s major works up to 1993, stated that the “Smurfette Principle” is applicable to preschoolers and adults alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solinger|first=Rickie|date=1995|editor-last=Pollitt|editor-first=Katha|title=First-Class Citizen|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4022132|journal=The Women's Review of Books|volume=12|issue=7|pages=1–3|doi=10.2307/4022132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Susina, a scholar and researcher of child and adolescent literature, used the term in a 1995 edition of the journal, ''The Lion and the Unicorn'', to back up his assertion that children’s literature is being “dumbed down” as a larger symptom of cultural problems, particularly that entertainment is like “junk food,” or unrewarding to the audience. He uses Pollitt’s term as evidence that a lack of women contributes to low quality media for children and also that the popular media has picked up on this issue in major publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Susina|first=Jan|date=1993|title=Editor's Note: Kiddie Lit(e): The Dumbing Down of Children's Literature|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/244499|journal=The Lion and the Unicorn|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=v–ix|doi=10.1353/uni.0.0256|issn=1080-6563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Khovansky Foundation''' ({{lang-ru|Фонд Хованского}}) is a [[non-profit organization]], founded in [[Voronezh]] in 1899. It is financed by funds ownership and donations from the citizens and associations.

== Мotto ==
The motto of the foundation are the words of [[Alexey Andreyevich Khovansky|A. A. Khovansky]]: ''“The treasure of knowledge is invaluable, it also has the distinction, that the one who donate it doesn't lose it, moreover, a donating hier is also an acquisition — with the growing level of public education grow those who donate it.”''.&lt;ref&gt;''Хованский А.А.'' [http://vrn-id.ru/filzaps98.htm  «Живое слово и живые факты»] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111104815/http://vrn-id.ru/filzaps98.htm |date=2013-11-11 }} // Филологические записки, Воронеж, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
After the death of the publisher A. Khovansky (January 29, 1899)&lt;ref&gt;Voronezh encyclopedia, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; there was organized the Foundation and the Prize for the best teachers of filology and history.&lt;ref&gt;''Прядкин С.'' «Памяти А. А. Хованского» // «Филологические записки», Воронеж, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;''

In 1917, the Foundation and the magazine [[Filologicheskie Zapiski]] ceased its activities  almost for a century.

The Khovansky-fund was reconstituted on the occasion of the 110th anniversary (November 4, 2009), again with the aim to support teachers and publishers.
[[File:Xovansky bust1.jpg|thumb|80px|&lt;center&gt;Khovansky statuette]]
[[File:Xovansky medal0.jpg|80px|thumb|Khovansky medal]]

== Activities ==
The objective of the fund is to determine  in special  contest "The Living Word" the best teachers of languages and history  in order to provide material support to winners.

Another purpose of the Fund is to recognize a special annual premium for publishers.

The Foundation carries out research in the areas of: [[comparative linguistics]], [[comparative mythology]], [[local history]], [[ethnic]] and [[social psychology]], [[psycholinguistics]] and [[semiotics]].

== Merit Awards ==
The Foundation has established new merit awards in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Alexei Khovansky: medal "The Living Word" — for personal rewarding teachers of English and other languages and the statuette “Alexy” — for teaching and creative teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rg.ru/2013/03/06/reg-cfo/medal-anons.html В Воронеже учителей наградили медалями Хованского // Российская газета]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Living Word" medal has been awarded to several leading Russian academicians. In 2014, British translators Kit Bicket and Pascal Cissé became the first anglophone winners of the medal, for their work on a collection of essays on Russian and British heraldry and symbols ''[http://ru.calameo.com/read/00352398832835522121b The Semiotic Cycle: Signs of a Woman in Love]''. The collection was specially translated by the Khovansky Foundation as part of the 2014 UK/Russia Year of Culture.

'''Udhauli''' (उधौली) is festival of the [[Kirati people|Kirat]] communities of [[Sunuwar]], [[Rai people|Rai]], [[Limbu]] and [[Yakkha]] of [[Nepal]] celebrated every year marking the migration phase downwards towards the low-altitude regions when the winter season arrives. The migration from the low-altitude areas upwards to hilly areas is called [[Ubhauli]] (upwards), which is also an annual festival of these communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nepaltravelnews.com/portal/events.php?event=15&lt;/ref&gt; On the Udhauli festival day, the Kirat people offer thanks to mother nature for providing a good harvest.

[[Image:2013 Udhauli Festival 11.JPG|thumb|Udhauli celebration by [[Kirati people|Kirat]] people]]

Udhauli festival is celebrated by all Kirat people. It is believed that from this day the winter season starts. So people, birds and animal migrate from cold regions to warmer regions. The Kirat people perform a special kind of dance called [[Sakela]] in this festival playing various musical instruments like Dhol, Jhyamta, etc. The Kirat women wear ''chhit ko guneu'' (a dress made from a specially patterned cloth) on this festival. This event of the Kirat people has also been stated in the Mundhum (holy book of the Kirat people).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1079500.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/udhauli-and-ubhauli-festivals/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''We Gotta Get out of This Place: Popular Conservatism and Postmodern Culture''''' by [[Lawrence Grossberg]] was published in 1992 and deals with several aspects of (then) contemporary American culture: Lawrence Grossberg states that it is a book about “the political, economic and cultural forces which are producing a new atmosphere, a new kind of dissatisfaction and a new conservatism in American life”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Grossberg, Lawrence|Grossberg (1992) 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he discusses how commercialization, a lack of passion, and depoliticization causes a new conservatism in [[rock music|rock]]. A critical review of the book calls it "a highly ambitious and intriguing work, if an ultimately flawed one."&lt;ref name=Gardiner&gt;Gardiner, Michael [https://www.ualberta.ca/~di/csh/csh09/Grossberg.html ''Rockin' at the White House'']  Memorial University of Newfoundland&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction, “Rock under siege”==

Lawrence Grossberg explains that the rising number of attacks on rock music only show the [[right wing politics|Right’s]] ambiguous relationship to [[popular culture]].

Attacks on rock music are usually produced by [[Christian fundamentalist]] movements and an “elitist fraction of a new conservative alliance”, who see rock as the main cause for “a certain fall from grace”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Grossberg, Lawrence|Grossberg (1992) 5]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Increasing Commodification of Rock Music===
Grossberg distinguishes between more organic forms of rock music, which sometimes characterize the 1960s, for example, and those of the 1980s, whose texts were highly choreographed by the culture industry (record labels, MTV, music magazines, etc.).

===Conservative Appropriation of Rock Music===
For Grossberg, the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] revival of conservatism can be understood in terms outlined by [[Antonio Gramsci]].  A popular [[hegemony]] sought to defang the critiques of the [[counterculture]] and reinscribe youth culture in the service of [[corporate capitalism]].

On the surface, this form does not resemble an attack but it uses rock music and reconstructs its meanings and significance. Thus, conservative Christian groups can use rock in order to spread their “fundamentalist and conservative messages”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Grossberg, Lawrence|Grossberg (1992) 8]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grossberg further states that these attacks on rock are actually quite paradoxical, as rock has become “part of a dominant mainstream culture”&lt;ref name=Bk9&gt;[[#Reference= Grossberg, Lawrence|Grossberg (1992) 9]]&lt;/ref&gt; and thus, “rock is losing power to encapsulate and articulate resistance and opposition””.&lt;ref name=Bk9/&gt; According to Grossberg, however, the new conservatives try to regulate the “possibilities of pleasure and identity as the basis opposition and to dismantle the cultural and political field constructed in the 1960s".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Grossberg, Lawrence|Grossberg (1992) 10]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Michael Gardiner writes, "According to Grossberg, the major consequence of this is that politics in present-day America has become curiously depoliticized. Strictly economic or ideological arguments in favour of the conservative agenda have been replaced by appeals to mood, passion, sentimentality, and so on."  Gardiner's review continues: "Yet, at the same time, daily life is repoliticized: the new [[conservatism]] seeks to take over the spaces and places within everyday life formerly occupied by youth culture (the body, pleasure/fun, youth) and invest them with new values and meanings. The overarching goal is to submit the practices of daily life to an apparatus of power that is more congenial to the requirements of the emerging [[post-Fordist]] economic order. One result is that politics has become largely personalized, just another "lifestyle choice," rather than a site of collective struggle in which popular culture used to play a crucial role:"&lt;ref name=Gardiner/&gt;

Gardiner then quotes Grossberg, "The collapse of all political space, civil society and everyday life and the transformation of everyday life in disciplined mobilization not only depoliticizes large segments of the population, it also eviscerates the recognition of popular culture as a terrain and weapon of struggle." &lt;ref&gt;'[[#Reference-Grossberg, Lawrence|Grossberg (1992) 308]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product history==
Based on [[Bois des Îles]], Égoïste is the first male perfume with [[sandalwood oil]] as its main note. Another of its components is [[ambrette seed]]. The fragrance's name when it was introduced domestically in the 1980s was Bois Noir, French for "Black Wood", a name that was originally used in the working stage. Prior to its 1990 international launch, the product was [[rebranding|rebranded]] because Chanel's marketing department did not like the Bois Noir name. The company had to purchase the rights to use the Égoïste name from photography magazine publisher Nicole Wisniak.&lt;ref name="jpolgehint"&gt;[http://hintmag.com/post/qampa-with-the-legendary-chanel-perfumer-jacques-polge--september-02-2010 Gaboué, Stéphane.

==Advertising==
The centerpiece of Chanel's advertising campaign to launch Égoïste first in Europe in April 1990 and in the United States one year later was a 30-second commercial, in French without subtitles, directed by [[Jean-Paul Goude]] and costing more than $1 million US to make.&lt;ref name="Kanner"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kanner |first=Bernice |title=Scents of Accomplishment: Society and Égoïste |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/New_York_Magazine.html?id=DukCAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=%22le+cid%22+egoiste |work=New York Magazine |date=18 March 1991 |pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foltz"&gt;{{cite news |last=Foltz |first=Kim |title=New Chanel Men's Scent Gets Provocative Campaign |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/05/business/the-media-business-advertising-new-chanel-men-s-scent-gets-provocative-campaign.html |work=The New York Times |date=5 March 1991 |page=D22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed in a desert outside of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. A stucco facade inspired by that of the [[InterContinental Carlton Cannes Hotel]] was constructed by 300 workers in less than four weeks.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Its primary feature was 36 [[balcony|balconies]] situated four high and nine wide, each with shuttered doors. With "[[Dance of the Knights]]" from Sergei Prokofiev's ballet ''Romeo and Juliet'' as its background music, the film opens in [[black and white]] with a sequence of women dressed in [[ball gown]]s shouting lines adapted from Pierre Corneille's tragicomic play ''[[Le Cid]]'':{{refn|name=Kanner}}
