{{Wiktionary|twenty}}

'''20''' ('''twenty''') is the [[natural number]] following [[19 (number)|19]] and preceding [[21 (number)|21]]. A group of twenty units may also be referred to as a '''score'''.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Conway and Richard K. Guy, ''The Book of Numbers''. New York: Copernicus (1996): 11. ""Score" is related to "share"  and comes from the Old Norse "skor" meaning a "notch" or "tally" on a stick used for counting. ... Often people counted in 20s; every 20th notch was larger, and so "score" also came to mean 20."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=score ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alexander horned sphere''' is a [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] object in [[topology]] discovered by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=James Waddell Alexander II|first=J. W. |last=Alexander|year=1924}}.

==Construction==
The Alexander horned sphere is the particular [[embedding (topology)|embedding]] of a [[sphere]] in 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] obtained by the following construction, starting with a [[standard torus]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hocking|Young|1988|pages=175–176}}. {{harvnb|Spivak|1999|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Remove a radial slice of the torus.
#Connect a standard punctured torus to each side of the cut, interlinked with the torus on the other side.
#Repeat steps 1–2 on the two tori just added ''ad infinitum''.
By considering only the points of the tori that are not removed at some stage, an embedding results of the sphere with a [[Cantor set]] removed. This embedding extends to the whole sphere, since points approaching two different points of the Cantor set will be at least a fixed distance apart in the construction.

==Impact on theory==
The horned sphere, together with its inside, is a topological [[ball (mathematics)|3-ball]], the '''Alexander horned ball''', and so is [[simply connected]]; i.e., every loop can be shrunk to a point while staying inside. The exterior is ''not'' simply connected, unlike the exterior of the usual round sphere; a loop linking a torus in the above construction cannot be shrunk to a point without touching the horned sphere. This shows that the [[Jordan–Schönflies theorem]] does not hold in three dimensions, as Alexander had originally thought. Alexander also proved that the theorem ''does'' hold in three dimensions for [[piecewise linear manifold|piecewise linear]]/[[differentiable manifold|smooth]] embeddings. This is one of the earliest examples where the need for distinction between the [[topological]] [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[manifold]]s, and the categories of [[differentiable manifold]]s, and [[piecewise linear manifold]]s  was noticed.

Now consider Alexander's horned sphere as an [[embedding]] into the [[3-sphere]], considered as the [[one-point compactification]] of the 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[closure (topology)|closure]] of the non-simply connected domain is called the '''solid Alexander horned sphere'''. Although the solid horned sphere is not a [[manifold]], [[R. H. Bing]] showed that its [[double (manifold)|double]] (which is the 3-manifold obtained by gluing two copies of the horned sphere together along the corresponding points of their boundaries) is in fact the 3-sphere.&lt;ref name="Bing1952"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Bing | first1=R. H. | title=A homeomorphism between the 3-sphere and the sum of two solid horned spheres | jstor=1969804 | mr=0049549 | year=1952 | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=Second Series | issn=0003-486X | volume=56 | pages=354–362 | doi=10.2307/1969804}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can consider other gluings of the solid horned sphere to a copy of itself, arising from different homeomorphisms of the boundary sphere to itself. This has also been shown to be the 3-sphere. The solid Alexander horned sphere is an example of a [[crumpled cube]]; i.e., a closed complementary domain of the embedding of a 2-sphere into the 3-sphere.

==Generalizations==
One can generalize Alexander's construction to generate other horned spheres by increasing the number of horns at each stage of Alexander's construction or considering the analogous construction in higher dimensions.

Other substantially different constructions exist for constructing such "wild" spheres. Another  example, also found by Alexander, is [[Antoine's horned sphere]], which is based on [[Antoine's necklace]], a pathological embedding of the [[Cantor set]] into the 3-sphere.

The '''angular diameter''', '''angular size''', '''apparent diameter''', or '''apparent size''' is an angular measurement describing how large a [[sphere]] or [[circle]] appears from a given point of view. In the [[vision sciences]], it is called the [[visual angle]], and in [[optics]], it is the [[angular aperture]] (of a [[lens (optics)|lens]]). The angular diameter can alternatively be thought of as the angle through which an eye or camera must rotate to look from one side of an apparent circle to the opposite side. '''Angular radius''' equals half the angular diameter.

==Formula==
[[File:Angular dia formula.JPG|thumb|400px|right|Diagram for the formula of the angular diameter]]

The angular diameter of a [[circle]] whose plane is perpendicular to the displacement vector between the point of view and the centre of said circle can be calculated using the formula&lt;ref&gt;This can be derived using the formula for the length of a cord found at {{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularSegment.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221042937/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularSegment.html |archivedate=2014-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta =  2\arctan \left(\frac{d}{2D}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
in which &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the angular diameter, and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are the actual diameter of and the distance to the object. When &lt;math&gt;D \gg d&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\delta \approx d / D&lt;/math&gt;, and the result obtained is in [[radians]].

For a spherical object whose ''actual'' diameter equals &lt;math&gt;d_\mathrm{act},&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the ''centre'' of the sphere, the angular diameter can be found by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\delta =  2\arcsin \left(\frac{d_\mathrm{act}}{2D}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The difference is due to the fact that the apparent edges of a sphere are its tangent points, which are closer to the observer than the centre of the sphere. For practical use, the distinction is only significant for spherical objects that are relatively close, since the [[small-angle approximation]] holds for &lt;math&gt; x \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathstat.concordia.ca/faculty/rhall/mc/arctan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218190328/http://www.mathstat.concordia.ca/faculty/rhall/mc/arctan.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\arcsin x \approx \arctan x \approx x&lt;/math&gt; .

[[File:Angular diameter.jpg|thumb|300px|Angular diameter: the angle subtended by an object]]

In [[astronomy]], the sizes of [[celestial object]]s are often given in terms of their angular diameter as seen from [[Earth]], rather than their actual sizes. Since these angular diameters are typically small, it is common to present them in [[arcsecond]]s (″). An arcsecond is 1/3600th of one [[degree (angle)|degree]] (1°), and a radian is 180/&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; degrees, so one radian equals 3,600*180/&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; arcseconds, which is about 206,265 arcseconds. Therefore, the angular diameter of an object with physical diameter ''d'' at a distance ''D'', expressed in arcseconds, is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stars and Galaxies |author=Michael A. Seeds |author2=Dana E. Backman |publisher=Brooks Cole |date=2010 |edition=7 |page=39 |isbn=978-0-538-73317-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; = (206,265) ''d'' / ''D'' arcseconds.

These objects have an angular diameter of 1″:
*an object of diameter 1 cm at a distance of 2.06 km
*an object of diameter 725.27&amp;nbsp;km at a distance of 1 [[astronomical unit]] (AU)
*an object of diameter 45&amp;nbsp;866&amp;nbsp;916&amp;nbsp;km at 1 [[light-year]]
*an object of diameter 1 AU (149&amp;nbsp;597&amp;nbsp;871&amp;nbsp;km) at a distance of 1 [[parsec]] (pc)

Thus, the angular diameter of [[Earth's orbit]] around the [[Sun]] as viewed from a distance of 1 pc is 2″, as 1 AU is the mean radius of Earth's orbit.

The angular diameter of the Sun, from a distance of one [[light-year]], is 0.03″, and that of [[Earth]] 0.0003″. The angular diameter 0.03″ of the Sun given above is approximately the same as that of a person at a distance of the diameter of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;hs=3cj&amp;q=arctan%286ft+%2F+12756.3+Km%29+in+arcseconds&amp;btnG=Search&lt;/ref&gt;

To get a true representation of the sizes, view the image at a distance of 103 times the width of the "Moon: max." circle. For example, if this circle is 5 cm wide on your monitor, view it from 5.15 m away.]]
[[File:Jupiter.mit.Io.Ganymed.Europa.Calisto.Vollmond.10.4.2017.jpg|thumb|250px|This photo compares the apparent sizes of [[Jupiter]] and its four [[Galilean moons]] ([[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] at maximum [[elongation (astronomy)|elongation]]) with the apparent diameter of the [[full moon|full Moon]] during their [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] on 10 April 2017.]]

The table shows that the angular diameter of Sun, when seen from Earth is approximately 32′ (1920″ or 0.53°), as illustrated above.

Thus the angular diameter of the Sun is about 250,000 times that of [[Sirius]]. (Sirius has twice the diameter and its distance is 500,000 times as much; the Sun is 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; times as bright, corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, so Sirius is roughly 6 times as bright per unit [[solid angle]].)

The angular diameter of the Sun is also about 250,000 times that of [[Alpha Centauri A]] (it has about the same diameter and the distance is 250,000 times as much; the Sun is 4×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; times as bright, corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 200,000, so Alpha Centauri A is a little brighter per unit solid angle).

The angular diameter of the Sun is about the same as that of the [[Moon]]. (The Sun's diameter is 400 times as large and its distance also; the Sun is 200,000 to 500,000 times as bright as the full Moon (figures vary), corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 450 to 700, so a celestial body with a diameter of 2.5–4″ and the same brightness per unit solid angle would have the same brightness as the full Moon.)

Even though Pluto is physically larger than Ceres, when viewed from Earth (e.g., through the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]) Ceres has a much larger apparent size.

Angular sizes measured in degrees are useful for larger patches of sky. (For example, the three stars of [[Orion's Belt|the Belt]] cover about 4.5° of angular size.) However, much finer units are needed to measure the angular sizes of galaxies, nebulae, or other objects of the [[night sky]].

Degrees, therefore, are subdivided as follows:
* 360 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s (°) in a full circle
* 60 [[arc-minute]]s (′) in one degree
* 60 [[arc-second]]s (″) in one arc-minute

To put this in perspective, the [[full moon|full Moon]] as viewed from Earth is about {{frac|1|2}°, or 30′ (or 1800″). The Moon's motion across the sky can be measured in angular size: approximately 15° every hour, or 15″ per second. A one-mile-long line painted on the face of the Moon would appear from Earth to be about 1″ in length.

In astronomy, it is typically difficult to directly measure the distance to an object, yet the object may have a known physical size (perhaps it is similar to a closer object with known distance) and a measurable angular diameter. In that case, the angular diameter formula can be inverted to yield the [[angular diameter distance]] to distant objects as 
:&lt;math&gt;d \equiv 2 D \tan \left( \frac{\delta}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

In non-Euclidean space, such as our expanding universe, the angular diameter distance is only one of several definitions of distance, so that there can be different "distances" to the same object.  See [[Distance measures (cosmology)]].

===Non-circular objects===
Many [[deep-sky object]]s such as [[galaxies]] and [[nebula]]e appear non-circular and are thus typically given two measures of diameter: major axis and minor axis. For example, the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] has a visual apparent diameter of {{DEC|5|20}} × {{DEC|3|5}}.

===Defect of illumination===
Defect of illumination is the maximum angular width of the unilluminated part of a celestial body seen by a given observer. For example, if an object is 40″ of arc across and is 75% illuminated, the defect of illumination is 10″.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2186">'''Applied probability''' is the application of [[probability theory]] to [[statistics|statistical]] problems and other scientific and [[engineering]] domains.

==Scope==
Much research involving [[probability]] is done under the auspices of '''applied probability'''. However, while such research is motivated (to some degree) by applied problems, it is usually the [[mathematics|mathematical]] aspects of the problems that are of most interest to researchers (as is typical of [[applied mathematics]] in general).

Applied probabilists are particularly concerned with the application of [[stochastic process]]es, and probability more generally, to the natural, applied and social sciences, including [[biology]], [[physics]] (including [[astronomy]]), [[chemistry]], [[medicine]], [[computer science]] and [[information technology]], and [[economics]].

Another area of interest is in [[engineering]]: particularly in areas of [[uncertainty]], [[risk management]], [[probabilistic design]], and [[Quality assurance]].

In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[algebraic number theory]], a '''Bauerian extension''' is a [[field extension]] of an [[algebraic number field]] which is characterized by the [[prime ideal]]s with [[inertial degree]] one in the extension.

For a finite [[Degree of a field extension|degree]] extension ''L''/''K'' of an algebraic number field ''K'' we define ''P''(''L''/''K'') to be the set of primes '''p''' of ''K'' which have a factor '''P''' with inertial degree one (that is, the [[residue field]] of '''P''' has the same order as the residue field of '''p''').

'''Bauer's theorem''' states that if ''M''/''K'' is a finite degree [[Galois extension]], then ''P''(''M''/''K'') ⊇ ''P''(''L''/''K'') if and only if ''M'' ⊆ ''L''.  In particular, finite degree Galois extensions ''N'' of ''K'' are characterised by set of prime ideals which split completely in ''N''.

An extension ''F''/''K'' is ''Bauerian'' if it obeys Bauer's theorem: that is, for every finite extension ''L'' of ''K'', we have ''P''(''F''/''K'') ⊇ ''P''(''L''/''K'') if and only if ''L'' contains a subfield ''K''-isomorphic to ''F''.

All field extensions of degree at most 4 over '''Q''' are Bauerian.&lt;ref name=Nark416&gt;Narkiewicz (1990) p.416&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of a non-Bauerian extension is the Galois extension of '''Q''' by the roots of 2''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; − 32''x'' + 1, which has Galois group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Nark394&gt;Narkiewicz (1990) p.394&lt;/ref&gt;

In physics, '''Born reciprocity''', also called '''reciprocal relativity''' or '''Born–Green reciprocity''', is a [[principle]] set up by theoretical physicist [[Max Born]] that calls for a [[duality (mathematics)|duality]]-[[symmetry]] among [[space]] and [[momentum]]. Born and his co-workers expanded his principle to a framework that is also known as '''reciprocity theory'''.&lt;ref name="born-1938"&gt;M. Born, A suggestion for unifying quantum theory and relativity, Proceedings of the Royal Society London A (1938), vol.&amp;nbsp;165, pp.&amp;nbsp;291–303, {{DOI|10.1098/rspa.1938.0060}} [http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/165/921/291.full.pdf full text]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="born-1949"&gt;M. Born (1949), Reciprocity Theory of Elementary Particles, Review of Modern Physics vol.&amp;nbsp;21, no.&amp;nbsp;3, pp.&amp;nbsp;463–473 {{DOI|10.1103/RevModPhys.21.463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born noticed a symmetry among [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] and [[momentum space]] representations of a [[free particle]], in that its wave function description is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] to a change of variables ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''p'' and ''p''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''x''. (It can also be worded such as to include [[scale factor]]s, e.g. invariance to ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''ap'' and ''p''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''bx'' where ''a'', ''b'' are constants.) Born hypothesized that such symmetry should apply to the [[four-vector]]s of [[special relativity]], that is, to the four-vector space coordinates
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} = X^{\mu} := \left(X^0, X^1, X^2, X^3 \right) = \left(ct, x, y, z \right) &lt;/math&gt;

and the four-vector momentum ([[four-momentum]]) coordinates
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P} = P^{\nu} := \left(P^0, P^1, P^2, P^3 \right) = \left(\frac{E}{c}, p_x, p_y, p_z \right) &lt;/math&gt;
Both in classical and in quantum mechanics, the Born reciprocity conjecture postulates that the transformation ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''p'' and ''p''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''x'' leaves invariant the [[Hamilton equations]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_i = \partial H / \partial p_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{p}_i = - \partial H / \partial x_i&lt;/math&gt;

From his reciprocity approach, Max Born conjectured the invariance of a space-time-momentum-energy [[line element]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Born, Reciprocity theory of elementary particles, Reviews of Modern Physics, vol.&amp;nbsp;21, no.&amp;nbsp;3 (1949), pp.&amp;nbsp;463–473 ([https://archive.is/20120711213744/http://rmp.aps.org/abstract/RMP/v21/i3/p463_1 abstract], [https://archive.is/20130223114859/http://rmp.aps.org/pdf/RMP/v21/i3/p463_1 full text])&lt;/ref&gt; Born and H.S. Green similarly introduced the notion an invariant (quantum) metric operator &lt;math&gt;x_k x^k + p_k p^k&lt;/math&gt; as extension of the [[Minkowski metric]] of special relativity to an invariant metric on [[phase space]] coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the introductory sections of: Jan Govaerts et al: World-line Quantisation of a Reciprocally Invariant System, [https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3736v1 arXiv:0706.3736v1] (submitted 26 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The metric is invariant under the group of [[quaplectic transformation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Morgan: [http://eprints.utas.edu.au/10689/ A Modern Approach to Born Reciprocity], PhD Thesis, University of Tasmania, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Govaerts, [[Peter D. Jarvis]], Stuart O. Morgan, Stephen G. Low, World-line quantization of a reciprocally invariant system, Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical, vol.&amp;nbsp;40 (2007), pp.&amp;nbsp;12095–12111, {{DOI|10.1088/1751-8113/40/40/006}} ([http://eprints.utas.edu.au/4450/1/4450.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a reciprocity as called for by Born can be observed in much, but not all, of the formalism of classical and quantum physics. Born's reciprocity theory was not developed much further for reason of difficulties in the mathematical foundations of the theory.

However Born's idea of a quantum metric operator was later taken up by [[Hideki Yukawa]] when developing his nonlocal quantum theory in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eduard Prugovečki]]: Stochastic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Spacetime, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1984, {{ISBN|978-9027716170}}, ''Section 4.5 Reciprocity Theory and Born's Quantum Metric Operator'', pp.&amp;nbsp;199 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y.

Caianiello]] proposed a "maximal acceleration", similarly as there is a [[Planck Length|minimal length at Planck scale]], and this concept of maximal acceleration has been expanded upon by others.&lt;ref&gt;Is there a maximal acceleration?

Not to be mistaken with the '''[[demarcation problem]]''' or boundary problem in the philosophy of science, '''boundary problem in [[spatial analysis]]''' is a geographical phenomenon and one of the four major issues that interfere with an accurate estimation of the [[statistical parameter]]. The four issues include the boundary problem as well as the scale problem, pattern problem (or spatial autocorrelation), and [[modifiable areal unit problem]] (Barber 1988).

The boundary problem occurs because of the loss of neighbors in analyses that depend on the values of the neighbors. While geographic phenomena are measured and analyzed within a specific unit, identical spatial data can appear either dispersed or clustered depending on the boundary placed around the data. In analysis with point data, dispersion is evaluated as dependent of the boundary. In analysis with areal data, statistics should be interpreted based upon the boundary.

In geographical research, two types of areas are taken into consideration in relation to the boundary: an area surrounded by fixed natural boundaries (e.g., coastlines or streams), outside of which neighbors do not exist (Henley 1981), or an area included in a larger region defined by arbitrary artificial boundaries (e.g., an air pollution boundary in modeling studies or an urban boundary in population migration) (Haining 1990). In an area isolated by the natural boundaries, the spatial process discontinues at the boundaries. In contrast, if a study area is delineated by the artificial boundaries, the process continues beyond the area.

If a spatial process in an area occurs beyond a study area or has an interaction with neighbors outside artificial boundaries, the most common approach is to neglect the influence of the boundaries and assume that the process occurs at the internal area. However, such an approach leads to a significant model misspecification problem (Upton and Fingleton 1985).

That is, for measurement or administrative purposes, geographic boundaries are drawn, but the boundaries can bring about different spatial patterns in geographic phenomena (BESR 2002). It has been reported that the difference in the way of drawing the boundary significantly affects identification of the spatial distribution and estimation of the statistical parameters of the spatial process (Cressie 1992; Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993; Griffith 1983; Martin 1987). The difference is largely based on the fact that spatial processes are generally unbounded or fuzzy-bounded (Leung 1987) but the processes are expressed in data imposed within boundaries for analysis purposes (Miller 1999). Although the boundary problem was discussed in relation to artificial and arbitrary boundaries, the effect of the boundaries also occurs according to natural boundaries as long as it is ignored that properties at sites on the natural boundary such as streams are likely to differ from those at sites within the boundary (Martin 1989).

The boundary problem occurs with regard not only to horizontal boundaries but also to vertically drawn boundaries according to delineations of heights or depths (Pineda 1993). For example, biodiversity such as the density of species of plants and animals is high near the surface, so if the identically divided height or depth is used as a spatial unit, it is more likely to find fewer number of the plant and animal species as the height or depth increases.

== Types and examples of the boundary problem ==

By drawing a boundary around a study area, two types of problems in measurement and analysis takes place (Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993). The first is an '''edge effect'''. This effect originates from the ignorance of interdependences that occur outside the bounded region. Griffith (1980; 1983) and Griffith and Amrhein (1983) highlighted problems according to the edge effect. A typical example is a cross-boundary influence such as cross-border jobs, services and other resources located in a neighboring municipality (Macquire 1995).

The second is a '''shape effect''' that results from the artificial shape delineated by the boundary. As an illustration of the effect of the artificial shape, point pattern analysis tends to provide higher levels of clustering for the identical point pattern within a unit that is more elongated (Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993). Similarly, the shape can influence interaction and flow among spatial entities (Arlinghaus and Nystuen 1990; Ferguson and Kanaroglou 1998; Griffith 1982). For example, the shape can affect the measurement of origin-destination flows since these are often recorded when they cross an artificial boundary. Because of the effect set by the boundary, the shape and area information is used to estimate travel distances from surveys (Rogerson 1990) or to locate traffic counters, travel survey stations, or traffic monitoring systems (Kirby 1997). From the same perspective, Theobald (2001; retrieved from BESR 2002) argued that measures of [[urban sprawl]] should consider interdependences and interactions with nearby rural areas.

In spatial analysis, the boundary problem has been discussed along with the [[modifiable areal unit problem]] (MAUP) inasmuch as MAUP is associated with the arbitrary geographic unit and the unit is defined by the boundary (Rogerson 2006). For administrative purposes, data for policy indicators are usually aggregated within larger units (or enumeration units) such as census tracts, school districts, municipalities and counties. The artificial units serve the purposes of taxation and service provision. For example, municipalities can effectively respond to the need of the public in their jurisdictions. However, in such spatially aggregated units, spatial variations of detailed social variables cannot be identified. The problem is noted when the average degree of a variable and its unequal distribution over space are measured (BESR 2002).

== Suggested solutions and evaluations on the solutions ==

Several strategies for resolving geographic boundary problems in measurement and analysis have been proposed (Martin 1987; Wong and Fotheringham 1990). To identify the effectiveness of the strategies, Griffith (1983) reviewed traditional techniques that were developed to mitigate the edge effects: ignoring the effects, undertaking a torus mapping, construction of an empirical butter zone, construction of an artificial butter zone, extrapolation into a buffer zone, utilizing a correction factor, etc. The first method (i.e., the ignorance of the edge effects), assumes and infinite surface in which the edge effects do not occur. In fact, this approach has been used by traditional geographical theories (e.g., [[central place theory]]). Its main shortcoming is that empirical phenomena occur within a finite area, so an infinite and homogeneous surface is unrealistic (Griffith and Amrhein 1983). The remaining five approaches are similar in that they attempted to produce unbiased parameter estimation, that is, to provide a medium by which the edge effects are removed (Griffith 1983). (He called these '''operational solutions''' as opposed to '''statistical solutions''' to be discussed below.) Specifically, the techniques aim at a collection of data beyond the boundary of the study area and fit a larger model, that is, mapping over the area or over-bounding the study area (Ripley 1979; Wong and Fotheringham 1990). Through simulation analysis, however, Griffith and Amrhein (1983) identified the inadequacy of such an overbounding technique. Moreover, this technique can bring about issues related to large-area statistics, that is, ecological fallacy. By expanding the boundary of the study area, micro-scale variations within the boundary can be ignored.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20111004153452/http://lh3.ggpht.com/_fHD7C68ZqPM/S-VBehIvDkI/AAAAAAAAARo/QQNdGka6s0E/s512/F4.jpg '''Figure 4.''' A solution to the boundary problem: overbounding]

As alternatives to operational solutions, Griffith (1983) examined three correction techniques (i.e., '''statistical solutions''') in removing boundary-induced bias from inference. They are (1) based on [[generalized least squares]] theory, (2) using dummy variables and a regression structure (as a way of creating a buffer zone), and (3) regarding the boundary problem as a missing values problem. However, these techniques require rather strict assumptions about the process of interest (Yoo and Kyriakidis 2008). For example, the solution according to the generalized least squares theory utilizes time-series modeling that needs an arbitrary transformation matrix to fit the multidirectional dependencies and multiple boundary units found in geographical data (Griffith 1980). Martin (1987) also argued that some of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques are unrealistic or unreasonably strict. Moreover, Griffith (1985) himself also identified the inferiority of the techniques through simulation analysis.

As particularly applicable using GIS technologies (Haslett et al. 1990; Openshaw et al. 1987), a possible solution for addressing both edge and shape effects is to an re-estimation of the spatial or process under repeated random realizations of the boundary. This solution provides an experimental distribution that can be subjected to statistical tests (Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993). As such, this strategy examines the sensitivity in the estimation result according to changes in the boundary assumptions. With GIS tools, boundaries can be systematically manipulated. The tools then conduct the measurement and analysis of the spatial process in such differentiated boundaries. Accordingly, such a [[sensitivity analysis]] allows the evaluation of the reliability and robustness of place-based measures that defined within artificial boundaries (BESR 2002). In the meantime, the changes in the boundary assumptions refer not only to altering or tilting the angles of the boundary, but also differentiating between the boundary and interior areas in examination and considering a possibility that isolated data collection points close to the boundary may show large variances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3381">The '''CRM-Fields-PIMS Prize''' is the premier [[Canada|Canadian]] research prize in the [[mathematical sciences]]. It is awarded in recognition of exceptional research achievement in the mathematical sciences and is given annually by three Canadian mathematics institutes: the [[Centre de Recherches Mathématiques]] (CRM), the [[Fields Institute]], and the [[Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences]] (PIMS).

The prize was established in 1994 by the CRM and the Fields Institute as the '''CRM-Fields Prize'''. The prize took its current name when PIMS became a partner in 2005.

The prize carries a monetary award of $10,000, funded jointly by the three institutes. The inaugural prize winner was [[H.S.M. Coxeter]].

In mathematics, '''''Canon arithmeticus''''' is a table of indices and powers with respect to [[Primitive root modulo n|primitive root]]s for prime powers less than 1000, originally published by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi | first=Carl Gustav Jacob|last= Jacobi|year=1839}}. The tables were at one time used for arithmetical calculations modulo prime powers, though like many mathematical tables they have now been replaced by digital computers. Jacobi also reproduced Burkhardt's table of the periods of decimal fractions of 1/''p'', and Ostrogradsky's tables of primitive roots of primes less than 200, and gave tables of indices of some odd numbers modulo powers of 2 with respect to the base 3 {{harv|Dickson|2005|loc=p.185–186}}.

Although the second edition of 1956 has Jacobi's name on the title, it has little in common with the first edition apart from the topic: the tables were completely recalculated, usually with a different choice of primitive root, by Wilhelm Patz. Jacobi's original tables use 10 or –10 or a number with a small power of this form as the primitive root whenever possible, while the second edition uses the smallest possible positive primitive root {{harv|Fletcher|1958}}.

The term "canon arithmeticus" is occasionally used to mean any table of indices and powers of primitive roots.

'''''Consequentia mirabilis''''' ([[Latin]] for "admirable consequence"), also known as '''[[Christopher Clavius|Clavius]]'s Law''', is used in [[traditional logic|traditional]] and [[classical logic]] to establish the truth of a proposition from the [[Consistency proof|inconsistency]] of its negation.&lt;ref&gt;Sainsbury, Richard. ''Paradoxes''. Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus similar to ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', but it can prove a proposition true using just its negation. It states that if a proposition is a consequence of its negation, then it is true, for consistency. It can thus be demonstrated without using any other principle, but that of consistency. (Barnes&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Jonathan. ''The Pre-Socratic Philosophers: The Arguments of the Philosophers''. Routledge, 1982, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; claims in passing that the term 'consequentia mirabilis' refers only to the inference of the proposition from the inconsistency of its negation, and that the term 'Lex Clavia' (or Clavius' Law) refers to the inference of the proposition's negation from the inconsistency of the proposition.) 

In formal notation:
&lt;math&gt; (\neg A \rightarrow A) \rightarrow A &lt;/math&gt;
which is equivalent to &lt;math&gt; (\neg \neg A \lor A) \rightarrow A &lt;/math&gt;.

''Consequentia mirabilis'' was a pattern of argument popular in 17th century Europe that first appeared in a fragment of Aristotle's ''[[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|Protrepticus]]:'' "If we ought to philosophise, then we ought to philosophise; and if we ought not to philosophise, then we ought to philosophise (i.e. in order to justify this view); in any case, therefore, we ought to philosophise."&lt;ref name="Kneale1957"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kneale |first=William |journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies |title=Aristotle and the Consequentia Mirabilis |volume=77 |number=1 |year=1957 |pages=62-66 |jstor=628635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous example is perhaps the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'': Even if one can question the validity of the thinking, no one can deny that they are thinking.

{{Computer architecture bit widths}}
'''Decimal floating-point''' ('''DFP''') arithmetic refers to both a representation and operations on [[decimal]] [[floating-point]] numbers. Working directly with decimal (base-10) fractions can avoid the rounding errors that otherwise typically occur when converting between decimal fractions (common in human-entered data, such as measurements or financial information) and binary (base-2) fractions.

The advantage of decimal floating-point representation over decimal [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] representation is that it supports a much wider range of values. For example, while a fixed-point representation that allocates 8 decimal digits and 2 decimal places can represent the numbers 123456.78, 8765.43, 123.00, and so on, a floating-point representation with 8 decimal digits could also represent 1.2345678, 1234567.8, 0.000012345678, 12345678000000000, and so on.  This wider range can dramatically slow the accumulation of rounding errors during successive calculations; for example, the [[Kahan summation algorithm]] can be used in floating point to add many numbers with no asymptotic accumulation of rounding error.

== {{anchor|64-bit|96-bit}}Implementations ==
Early mechanical uses of decimal floating point are evident in the [[abacus]], [[slide rule]], the [[Smallwood calculator]], and some other [[calculator]]s that support entries in [[scientific notation]]. In the case of the mechanical calculators, the exponent is often treated as side information that is accounted for separately.

The otherwise binary [[Wang VS]] machine supported a 64-bit decimal floating-point format.&lt;ref name="Savard_2018"/&gt; The floating-point support library for the [[Motorola 68040]] processor provided a 96-bit decimal floating-point storage format.&lt;ref name="Savard_2018"/&gt;

Some [[computer language]]s have implementations of decimal floating-point arithmetic, including [[PL/I]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[java (programming language)|Java]] with big decimal, [[emacs]] with calc, and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]'s decimal module.
In 1987, the [[IEEE]] released [[IEEE 854]], a standard for computing with decimal floating point, which lacked a specification for how floating-point data should be encoded for interchange with other systems. This was subsequently addressed in [[IEEE 754-2008]], which standardized the encoding of decimal floating-point data, albeit with two different alternative methods.

IBM [[POWER6]] and newer POWER processors include DFP in hardware, as does the [[IBM System z9]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-306.ibm.com/common/ssi/rep_ca/0/897/ENUS107-190/ENUS107190.PDF |format=PDF |title=IBM z9 EC and z9 BC — Delivering greater value for everyone |website=306.ibm.com |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and z10). SilMinds offers SilAx, a configurable vector DFP [[coprocessor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silminds.com/decimal-products/accelerator-cards/76 |title=Arithmetic IPs for Financial Applications - SilMinds |website=Silminds.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IEEE 754-2008]] defines this in more detail. [[Fujitsu]] also has 64-bit [[Sparc]] processors with DFP in hardware.&lt;ref name="Savard_2018"/&gt;

Microsoft C#, or [[.NET]], uses System.Decimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/decimal.html|title=Decimal floating point in .NET|website=Yoda.arachsys.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IEEE 754-2008 encoding ==
The [[IEEE 754-2008]] standard defines 32-, 64- and 128-bit decimal floating-point representations.  Like the binary floating-point formats, the number is divided into a sign, an exponent, and a [[significand]].  Unlike binary floating-point, numbers are not necessarily normalized; values with few [[significant digits]] have multiple possible representations: 1×10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.1×10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=0.01×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, etc.  When the significand is zero, the exponent can be any value at all.

|}

The exponent ranges were chosen so that the range available to normalized values is approximately symmetrical.  Since this cannot be done exactly with an even number of possible exponent values, the extra value was given to Emax.

Two different representations are defined:
* One with a '''binary integer significand field''' encodes the significand as a large binary integer between 0 and 10&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;−1.  This is expected to be more convenient for software implementations using a binary [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]].
* Another with a '''densely packed decimal significand field''' encodes decimal digits more directly.  This makes conversion to and from binary floating-point form faster, but requires specialized hardware to manipulate efficiently.  This is expected to be more convenient for hardware implementations.

Both alternatives provide exactly the same range of representable values.

The most significant two bits of the exponent are limited to the range of 0−2, and the most significant 4 bits of the significand are limited to the range of 0−9.  The 30 possible combinations are encoded in a 5-bit field, along with special forms for infinity and [[NaN]].

If the most significant 4 bits of the significand are between 0 and 7, the encoded value begins as follows:

 s 00mmm xxx   Exponent begins with 00, significand with 0mmm
 s 01mmm xxx   Exponent begins with 01, significand with 0mmm
 s 10mmm xxx   Exponent begins with 10, significand with 0mmm

If the leading 4 bits of the significand are binary 1000 or 1001 (decimal 8 or 9), the number begins as follows:

 s 1100m xxx   Exponent begins with 00, significand with 100m
 s 1101m xxx   Exponent begins with 01, significand with 100m
 s 1110m xxx   Exponent begins with 10, significand with 100m

The leading bit (s in the above) is a sign bit, and the following bits (xxx in the above) encode the additional exponent bits and the remainder of the most significant digit, but the details vary depending on the encoding alternative used.

The final combinations are used for infinities and NaNs, and are the same for both alternative encodings:

 s 11110 x   ±Infinity (see [[Extended real number line]])
 s 11111 0   quiet NaN (sign bit ignored)
 s 11111 1   signaling NaN (sign bit ignored)

In the latter cases, all other bits of the encoding are ignored.  Thus, it is possible to initialize an array to NaNs by filling it with a single byte value.

=== Binary integer significand field ===
This format uses a binary significand from 0 to 10&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;−1.  For example, the Decimal32 significand can be up to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;−1 = {{gaps|9|999|999}} = 98967F&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; = {{gaps|1001|1000100101|1001111111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. While the encoding can represent larger significands, they are illegal and the standard requires implementations to treat them as 0, if encountered on input.

As described above, the encoding varies depending on whether the most significant 4 bits of the significand are in the range 0 to 7 (0000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to 0111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or higher (1000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or 1001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

If the 2 bits after the sign bit are "00", "01", or "10", then the exponent field consists of the 8 bits following the sign bit (the 2 bits mentioned plus 6 bits of "exponent continuation field"), and the significand is the remaining 23 bits, with an implicit leading 0 bit, shown here in parentheses:

 s 00eeeeee   (0)ttt tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 01eeeeee   (0)ttt tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 10eeeeee   (0)ttt tttttttttt tttttttttt

This includes [[subnormal numbers]] where the leading significand digit is 0.

If the 2 bits after the sign bit are "11", then the 8-bit exponent field is shifted 2 bits to the right (after both the sign bit and the "11" bits thereafter), and the represented significand is in the remaining 21 bits. In this case there is an implicit (that is, not stored) leading 3-bit sequence "100" in the true significand:

 s 1100eeeeee (100)t tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 1101eeeeee (100)t tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 1110eeeeee (100)t tttttttttt tttttttttt

The "11" 2-bit sequence after the sign bit indicates that there is an ''implicit'' "100" 3-bit prefix to the significand.

Note that the leading bits of the significand field do ''not'' encode the most significant decimal digit; they are simply part of a larger pure-binary number.  For example, a significand of {{gaps|8|000|000}} is encoded as binary {{gaps|0111|1010000100|1000000000}}, with the leading 4 bits encoding 7; the first significand which requires a 24th bit (and thus the second encoding form) is 2&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; = {{gaps|8|388|608}}.

In the above cases, the value represented is:

: (−1)&lt;sup&gt;sign&lt;/sup&gt; × 10&lt;sup&gt;exponent−101&lt;/sup&gt; × significand &lt;!-- Remember, significand is defined as an integer: 0 &lt;= significand &lt; 10^8 --&gt;

Decimal64 and Decimal128 operate analogously, but with larger exponent continuation and significand fields.  For Decimal128, the second encoding form is actually never used; the largest valid significand of 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;−1 = 1ED09BEAD87C0378D8E63FFFFFFFF&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; can be represented in 113 bits.

=== Densely packed decimal significand field ===
In this version, the significand is stored as a series of decimal digits.  The leading digit is between 0 and 9 (3 or 4 binary bits), and the rest of the significand uses the [[densely packed decimal]] (DPD) encoding.

Unlike the binary integer significand version, where the exponent changed position and came before the significand, this encoding combines the leading 2 bits of the exponent and the leading digit (3 or 4 bits) of the significand into the five bits that follow the sign bit.  This is followed by a fixed-offset exponent continuation field.

Finally, the significand continuation field made of 2, 5, or 11 10-bit ''[[declet (computing)|declet]]s'', each encoding 3 decimal digits.&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Muller |author-first1=Jean-Michel |author-last2=Brisebarre |author-first2=Nicolas |author-last3=de Dinechin |author-first3=Florent |author-last4=Jeannerod |author-first4=Claude-Pierre |author-last5=Lefèvre |author-first5=Vincent |author-last6=Melquiond |author-first6=Guillaume |author-last7=Revol |author-first7=Nathalie |author-last8=Stehlé |author-first8=Damien |author-last9=Torres |author-first9=Serge |title=Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetic |year=2010 |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |edition=1 |isbn=978-0-8176-4704-9&lt;!-- print --&gt; |doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4705-6 |lccn=2009939668&lt;!-- |id=ISBN 978-0-8176-4705-6 (online), ISBN-10 0-8176-4704-X (print) --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the first two bits after the sign bit are "00", "01", or "10", then those are the leading bits of the exponent, and the three bits after that are interpreted as the leading decimal digit (0 to 7):&lt;ref&gt;[http://speleotrove.com/decimal/dbspec.html Decimal Encoding Specification, version 1.00], from IBM&lt;/ref&gt;

If the first two bits after the sign bit are "11", then the second two bits are the leading bits of the exponent, and the last bit is prefixed with "100" to form the leading decimal digit (8 or 9):

    Comb.  Exponent          Significand
 s 1100 T (00)eeeeee (100T)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt]
 s 1101 T (01)eeeeee (100T)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt]
 s 1110 T (10)eeeeee (100T)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt]

The remaining two combinations (11110 and 11111) of the 5-bit field are used to represent ±infinity and NaNs, respectively.

== Floating-point arithmetic operations ==
The usual rule for performing floating-point arithmetic is that the exact mathematical value is calculated,&lt;ref&gt;Computer hardware doesn't necessarily compute the exact value; it simply has to produce the equivalent rounded result as though it had computed the infinitely precise result.&lt;/ref&gt; and the result is then rounded to the nearest representable value in the specified precision. This is in fact the behavior mandated for IEEE-compliant computer hardware, under normal rounding behavior and in the absence of exceptional conditions.

For ease of presentation and understanding, 7-digit precision will be used in the examples. The fundamental principles are the same in any precision.

=== Addition ===
A simple method to add floating-point numbers is to first represent them with the same exponent. In the example below, the second number is shifted right by 3 digits. We proceed with the usual addition method:

The following example is decimal, which simply means the base is 10.

   123456.7 = 1.234567 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;
   101.7654 = 1.017654 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.001017654 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

   Hence:
   123456.7 + 101.7654 = (1.234567 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) + (1.017654 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) =
   = (1.234567 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) + (0.001017654 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) =
                       = 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; × (1.234567 + 0.001017654) = 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; × 1.235584654.

This is nothing other than converting to [[scientific notation]].
In detail:

   e=5;  s=1.234567     (123456.7)
 + e=2;  s=1.017654     (101.7654)

   e=5;  s=1.234567
 + e=5;  s=0.001017654  (after shifting)
 --------------------
   e=5;  s=1.235584654  (true sum: 123558.4654)

This is the true result, the exact sum of the operands. It will be rounded to 7 digits and then normalized if necessary. The final result is:
   e=5;  s=1.235585    (final sum: 123558.5)

Note that the low 3 digits of the second operand (654) are essentially lost. This is [[round-off error]]. In extreme cases, the sum of two non-zero numbers may be equal to one of them:

   e=5;  s=1.234567
 + e=−3; s=9.876543

   e=5;  s=1.234567
 + e=5;  s=0.00000009876543 (after shifting)
 ----------------------
   e=5;  s=1.23456709876543 (true sum)
   e=5;  s=1.234567         (after rounding/normalization)

Another problem of loss of significance occurs when two close numbers are subtracted.
e=5; s=1.234571 and e=5; s=1.234567 are representations of the rationals 123457.1467 and 123456.659.

   e=5;  s=1.234571
 − e=5;  s=1.234567
 ----------------
   e=5;  s=0.000004
   e=−1; s=4.000000 (after rounding/normalization)

The best representation of this difference is e=−1; s=4.877000, which differs more than 20% from e=−1; s=4.000000. In extreme cases, the final result may be zero even though an exact calculation may be several million. This ''[[loss of significance|cancellation]]'' illustrates the danger in assuming that all of the digits of a computed result are meaningful.

Dealing with the consequences of these errors are topics in [[numerical analysis]].

=== Multiplication ===
To multiply, the significands are multiplied, while the exponents are added, and the result is rounded and normalized.

   e=3;  s=4.734612
 × e=5;  s=5.417242
 -----------------------
   e=8;  s=25.648538980104 (true product)
   e=8;  s=25.64854        (after rounding)
   e=9;  s=2.564854        (after normalization)

Division is done similarly, but that is more complicated.

There are no cancellation or absorption problems with multiplication or division, though small errors may accumulate as operations are performed repeatedly. In practice, the way these operations are carried out in digital logic can be quite complex.

== History ==
'''Enterprise Dynamics''' is based on the Taylor II simulation software, which was developed by F&amp;H Simulations.&lt;ref&gt;William B. Nordgren. "Taylor II manufacturing simulation software". ''In Proceedings of the 27th Conference on Winter Simulation, IEEE Computer Society'', Washington, DC, 401–404, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the newly developed simulation platform Taylor Enterprise Dynamics was introduced and in 2000, F&amp;H Simulations was acquired by the consulting company and simulation software distributor Incontrol Business Engineers. The new company name became [[INCONTROL Simulation Solutions]] and Taylor ED was renamed to '''Enterprise Dynamics'''. At this time F&amp;H Simulations, now called Flexsim Software Products, became independent and developed a new simulation software called [[Flexsim]].&lt;ref name="ED Brochures"&gt;{{cite web|title=ED Brochures|url=http://support.incontrolsim.com/en/ed-brochures.html|accessdate=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flexsim company history|url=http://www.flexsim.com/company/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
'''Enterprise Dynamics''' is an object-oriented simulation platform combined with an event-oriented approach. The user can select standard simulation objects (the so-called 'Atoms'), in which the behavior of their real life equivalents is captured, from a library and create a model by clicking and dragging the objects into the model space. For each simulation object, parameters can be altered to change its behavior.&lt;ref name="DW Dillen Book"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y.H. Lian, H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1584">In [[differential geometry]], the '''equivariant index theorem''', of which there are several variants, computes the (graded) trace of an element of a compact Lie group acting in given setting in terms of the integral over the [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of the element. If the element is neutral, then the theorem reduces to the usual [[index theorem]].

The classical formula such as the [[Atiyah–Bott formula]] is a special case of the theorem.

== Statement ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\pi: E \to M&lt;/math&gt; be a [[clifford module bundle]]. Assume a compact Lie group ''G'' acts on both ''E'' and ''M'' so that &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is [[equivariant bundle|equivariant]]. Let ''E'' be given a connection that is compatible with the action of ''G''. Finally, let ''D'' be a [[Dirac operator]] on ''E'' associated to the given data. In particular, ''D'' commutes with ''G'' and thus the kernel of ''D'' is a finite-dimensional representation of ''G''.

The '''equivariant index''' of ''E'' is a [[Brauer's theorem on induced characters|virtual character]] given by taking the [[supertrace]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{str}(g\mid\ker D) = \operatorname{tr}(g\mid\ker D^+) -  \operatorname{tr}(g\mid\ker D^-).&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- This gives the one side of the formula. For the other side, (to be finished.) --&gt;

'''Ernst Gabor Straus''' (February 25, 1922 – July 12, 1983) was a [[Germans|German]]-[[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] of [[Jewish]] origin who helped found the theories of Euclidean [[Ramsey theory]] and of the arithmetic properties of [[analytic function]]s. His extensive list of co-authors includes [[Albert Einstein]], [[Paul Erdős]], [[Richard Bellman]], [[Béla Bollobás]], [[Sarvadaman Chowla]], [[Ronald Graham]], [[Mathukumalli V. Subbarao|Mathukumalli V Subbarao]], [[László Lovász]], [[Carl Pomerance]], and [[George Szekeres]].

==Biography==
Straus was born in [[Munich]], February 25, 1922, the youngest of five children (Isa, Hana, Peter, Gabriella) of a prominent [[Zionism|Zionist]] attorney, Elias (Eli) Straus, and his wife [[:de:Rahel Straus|Rahel Straus née Goitein]], a medical doctor and feminist. Ernst Gabor Straus came to be known as a mathematical prodigy from a very young age. Following the death of his father, the family fled the [[Nazi]] regime for [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1933, and Straus was educated at the [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Although he never received an undergraduate degree, Straus began graduate studies at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York (city)|New York]], earning a PhD in 1948 under [[F. J. Murray]]. Two years later, he became the assistant of [[Albert Einstein]]. After a three-year stint at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], Straus took a position at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], which he kept for the rest of his life. Straus died July 12, 1983 of heart failure.

Straus's interests ranged widely over his career, beginning with his early work on relativity with Einstein and continuing with deep work in [[analytic number theory]], [[extremal graph theory]], and [[combinatorics]]. One of his best known contributions in popular mathematics is the [[Erdős–Straus conjecture]] that every number of the form 4/''n'' has a three-term [[Egyptian fraction]].

In [[mathematics]], the [[L-function]]s of [[number theory]] are expected to have several characteristic properties, one of which is that they satisfy certain '''[[functional equation]]s'''. There is an elaborate theory of what these equations should be, much of which is still conjectural.

== Introduction ==

A prototypical example, the [[Riemann zeta function]] has a functional equation relating its value at the [[complex number]] ''s'' with its value at 1 &amp;minus; ''s''. In every case this relates to some value ζ(''s'') that is only defined by [[analytic continuation]] from the [[infinite series]] definition. That is, writing{{spaced ndash}}as is conventional{{spaced ndash}}σ for the real part of ''s'', the functional equation relates the cases

:σ &gt; 1 and σ &lt; 0,

and also changes a case with

:0 &lt; σ &lt; 1

in the ''critical strip'' to another such case, reflected in the line σ = ½. Therefore, use of the functional equation is basic, in order to study the zeta-function in the whole [[complex plane]].

The functional equation in question for the Riemann zeta function takes the simple form

:&lt;math&gt;Z(s) = Z(1-s) \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z''(''s'') is ζ(''s'') multiplied by a ''gamma-factor'', involving the [[gamma function]]. This is now read as an 'extra' factor in the [[Euler product]] for the zeta-function, corresponding to the [[infinite prime]]. Just the same shape of functional equation holds for the [[Dedekind zeta function]] of a [[number field]] ''K'', with an appropriate gamma-factor that depends only on the embeddings of ''K'' (in algebraic terms, on the [[tensor product of fields|tensor product]] of ''K'' with the [[real number|real field]]).

There is a similar equation for the [[Dirichlet L-function]]s, but this time relating them in pairs:

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(s,\chi)=\varepsilon\Lambda(1-s,\chi^*)&lt;/math&gt;

with χ a [[primitive Dirichlet character]], χ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; its complex conjugate, Λ the L-function multiplied by a gamma-factor, and ε a complex number of [[absolute value]] 1, of shape

:&lt;math&gt;G(\chi) \over {\left |G(\chi)\right \vert}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G''(χ) is a [[Gauss sum]] formed from χ. This equation has the same function on both sides if and only if χ is a ''real character'', taking values in {0,1,&amp;minus;1}. Then ε must be 1 or &amp;minus;1, and the case of the value &amp;minus;1 would imply a zero of ''Λ''(''s'') at ''s'' = ½. According to the theory (of Gauss, in effect) of Gauss sums, the value is always 1, so no such ''simple'' zero can exist (the function is ''even'' about the point).

== Theory of functional equations ==

A unified theory of such functional equations was given by [[Erich Hecke]], and the theory was taken up again in ''[[Tate's thesis]]'' by [[John Tate]]. Hecke found generalised characters of number fields, now called [[Hecke character]]s, for which his proof (based on [[theta function]]s) also worked. These characters and their associated L-functions are now understood to be strictly related to [[complex multiplication]], as the Dirichlet characters are to [[cyclotomic field]]s.

There are also functional equations for the [[local zeta-function]]s, arising at a fundamental level for the (analogue of) [[Poincaré duality]] in [[étale cohomology]]. The Euler products of the [[Hasse–Weil zeta-function]] for an [[algebraic variety]] ''V'' over a number field ''K'', formed by reducing ''modulo'' [[prime ideal]]s to get local zeta-functions, are conjectured to have a ''global'' functional equation; but this is currently considered out of reach except in special cases. The definition can be read directly out of étale cohomology theory, again; but in general some assumption coming from [[automorphic representation]] theory seems required to get the functional equation. The [[Taniyama–Shimura conjecture]] was a particular case of this as general theory. By relating the gamma-factor aspect to [[Hodge theory]], and detailed studies of the expected ε factor, the theory as empirical has been brought to quite a refined state, even if proofs are missing.

'''Gauss's diary''' was a record of the mathematical discoveries of [[C. F. Gauss]] from 1796 to 1814. It was rediscovered in 1897 and published by {{harvtxt|Klein|1903}}, and reprinted in volume X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of his collected works and in {{harv|Gauss|2005}}. There is an English translation with commentary given by {{harvtxt|Gray|1984}}, reprinted in the second edition of {{harv|Dunnington|2004}}.

==Sample entries==

Most of the entries consist of a brief and sometimes cryptic statement of a result in Latin.

Entry 1, dated 1796, March 30, states "Principia quibus innititur sectio circuli, ac divisibilitus eiusdem geometrica in septemdecim partes etc.", which records Gauss's discovery of the construction of a [[heptadecagon]] by ruler and compass.

Entry 18, dated 1796, July 10, states  "[[Eureka (word)|ΕΥΡΗΚΑ]]!  num&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;Delta;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&amp;Delta;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&amp;Delta;" and records his discovery of a proof that any number is the sum of 3 triangular numbers, a special case of the [[Fermat polygonal number theorem]].
 
Entry 43, dated 1796, October 21, states "Vicimus GEGAN" (We have conquered GEGAN). The meaning of this was a mystery for many years. {{harvtxt|Biermann|1997}} found a manuscript by Gauss suggesting that GEGAN is a reversal of the acronym NAGEG standing for Nexum medii Arithmetico-Geometricum Expectationibus Generalibus and refers to the connection between the arithmetic geometric mean and elliptic functions. 

Entry 146, dated 1814 July 9, is the last entry, and records an observation relating biquadratic residues and the [[Lemniscatic elliptic function|lemniscate functions]], later proved by Gauss and by {{harvtxt|Chowla|1940}}. More precisely, Gauss observed that if ''a''+''bi'' is a (Gaussian) prime and ''a''–1+''bi'' is divisible by 2+2''i'', then the number of solutions to the congruence 1=''xx''+''yy''+''xxyy''  (mod ''a''+''bi''), including ''x''=∞, ''y''=±''i'' and ''x''=±''i'', ''y''=∞, is (''a''–1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

However, unlike a set, an object of a general category need not be determined by its global elements (not even [[up to]] [[isomorphism]]).  For example, the terminal object of the category '''Grph''' of [[graph homomorphism]]s has one vertex and one edge, a self-loop,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In an [[elementary topos]] the global elements of the [[subobject classifier]] Ω form a Heyting algebra when ordered by inclusion of the corresponding subobjects of the terminal object.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The internal logic of '''Grph''' is therefore based on the three-element [[Heyting algebra]] as its [[truth value]]s.

A [[well-pointed category]] is a category that has enough global elements to distinguish every two arrows. That is, for each two different arrows {{nowrap|''A'' → ''B''}} in the category, there should exist a global element whose compositions with them are different from each other.&lt;ref name="mm"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63552">'''Heart rate''' is the speed of the [[cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] measured by the number of contractions (beats) of the [[heart]] per minute (bpm). The heart rate can vary according to the body's [[Human body|physical]] needs, including the need to absorb [[oxygen]] and excrete [[carbon dioxide]]. It is usually equal or close to the [[pulse]] measured at any peripheral point. Activities that can provoke change include [[physical exercise]], [[sleep]], [[anxiety]], [[stress (psychological)|stress]], [[disease|illness]], and ingestion of [[drug]]s.

The [[American Heart Association]] states the normal resting adult human heart rate is 60–100 bpm.&lt;ref name='aha_rest'&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/GettheFactsAboutHighBloodPressure/All-About-Heart-Rate-Pulse_UCM_438850_Article.jsp|title = All About Heart Rate (Pulse) |date = 22 Aug 2017|accessdate = 25 Jan 2018|website = All About Heart Rate (Pulse)|publisher = American Heart Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tachycardia]] is a fast heart rate, defined as above 100 bpm at rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Arrhythmia/AboutArrhythmia/Tachycardia_UCM_302018_Article.jsp|title = &lt;nowiki&gt;Tachycardia| Fast Heart Rate&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date = 2 May 2013|accessdate = 21 May 2014|website = Tachycardia|publisher = American Heart Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bradycardia]] is a slow heart rate, defined as below 60 bpm at rest. During sleep a slow heartbeat with rates around 40–50 bpm is common and is considered normal.  When the heart is not beating in a regular pattern, this is referred to as an [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]. Abnormalities of heart rate sometimes indicate disease.{{sfn|Fuster|Wayne|O'Rouke|2001|pp=78–79}}

While heart rhythm is regulated entirely by the [[sinoatrial node]] under normal conditions, heart rate is regulated by [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] input to the sinoatrial node. The [[accelerans nerve]] provides sympathetic input to the heart by releasing [[norepinephrine]] onto the cells of the sinoatrial node (SA node), and the [[vagus nerve]] provides parasympathetic input to the heart by releasing [[acetylcholine]] onto sinoatrial node cells. Therefore, stimulation of the accelerans nerve increases heart rate, while stimulation of the vagus nerve decreases it.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Nielsen 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmidt-Nielsen|first=Knut|title=Animal physiology: adaptation and environment|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Due to individuals having a constant blood volume, one of the physiological ways to deliver more oxygen to an organ is to increase heart rate to permit blood to pass by the organ more often.{{sfn|Fuster|Wayne|O'Rouke|2001|pp=78–79}} Normal resting heart rates range from 60-100 bpm.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aladin|first=Amer I.|last2=Whelton|first2=Seamus P.|last3=Al-Mallah|first3=Mouaz H.|last4=Blaha|first4=Michael J.|last5=Keteyian|first5=Steven J.|last6=Juraschek|first6=Stephen P.|last7=Rubin|first7=Jonathan|last8=Brawner|first8=Clinton A.|last9=Michos|first9=Erin D.|date=2014-12-01|title=Relation of resting heart rate to risk for all-cause mortality by gender after considering exercise capacity (the Henry Ford exercise testing project)|journal=The American Journal of Cardiology|volume=114|issue=11|pages=1701–06|doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.08.042|issn=1879-1913|pmid=25439450}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hjalmarson|first=A.|last2=Gilpin|first2=E.

* [[Central nervous system]] [[stimulant]]s such as [[substituted amphetamine]]s increase heart rate.
* Central nervous system [[depressant]]s or [[sedative]]s decrease the heart rate (apart from some particularly strange ones with equally strange effects, such as [[ketamine]] which can cause – amongst many other things – stimulant-like effects such as [[tachycardia]]).
There are many ways in which the heart rate speeds up or slows down. Most involve stimulant-like [[endorphin]]s and [[hormone]]s being released in the brain, many of which are those that are 'forced'/'enticed' out by the ingestion and processing of drugs.

This section discusses target heart rates for healthy persons and are inappropriately high for most persons with coronary artery disease.&lt;ref name="pmid1866953"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anderson JM | title = Rehabilitating elderly cardiac patients | journal = West.

It is also influenced by [[central nervous system|central]] factors through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves.&lt;ref name=GUYTONHALL2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Arthur C. Guyton, John E.|title=Textbook of medical physiology|date=2005|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7216-0240-0|pages=116–22|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nervous influence over the heartrate is centralized within the two paired [[cardiovascular centre]]s of the [[medulla oblongata]]. The cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves, and the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via parasympathetic stimulation as one component of the [[vagus nerve]]. During rest, both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart, contributing to autonomic tone. This is a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles. Normally, vagal stimulation predominates as, left unregulated, the SA node would initiate a [[sinus rhythm]] of approximately 100 bpm.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Betts|first1=J. Gordon|title=Anatomy &amp; physiology|date=2013|isbn=1938168135|url=http://cnx.org/content/m46676/latest/?collection=col11496/latest|accessdate=11 August 2014|pages=787–846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli flow through the paired [[cardiac plexus]] near the base of the heart. The cardioaccelerator center also sends additional fibers, forming the cardiac nerves via sympathetic ganglia (the cervical ganglia plus superior thoracic ganglia T1–T4) to both the SA and AV nodes, plus additional fibers to the atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter [[norepinephrine]] (also known as [[noradrenaline]]) at the [[neuromuscular junction]] of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heartrate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor. [[High blood pressure]] medications are used to block these receptors and so reduce the heart rate.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

[[File:2032 Automatic Innervation.jpg|thumb|left|Autonomic Innervation of the Heart - Cardioaccelerator and cardioinhibitory areas are components of the paired cardiac centers located in the medulla oblongata of the brain. They innervate the heart via sympathetic cardiac nerves that increase cardiac activity and vagus (parasympathetic) nerves that slow cardiac activity.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;]]

Parasympathetic stimulation originates from the cardioinhibitory region with impulses traveling via the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). The vagus nerve sends branches to both the SA and AV nodes, and to portions of both the atria and ventricles. Parasympathetic stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. ACh slows HR by opening chemical- or ligand-gated potassium ion channels to slow the rate of spontaneous depolarization, which extends repolarization and increases the time before the next spontaneous depolarization occurs. Without any nervous stimulation, the SA node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm. Since resting rates are considerably less than this, it becomes evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows HR. This is similar to an individual driving a car with one foot on the brake pedal. To speed up, one need merely remove one’s foot from the brake and let the engine increase speed. In the case of the heart, decreasing parasympathetic stimulation decreases the release of ACh, which allows HR to increase up to approximately 100 bpm. Any increases beyond this rate would require sympathetic stimulation.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;
[[File:2033 Depolarization in Sinus Rhythm.jpg|thumb|Effects of Parasympathetic and Sympathetic Stimulation on Normal Sinus Rhythm - The wave of depolarization in a normal sinus rhythm shows a stable resting HR. Following parasympathetic stimulation, HR slows. Following sympathetic stimulation, HR increases.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;]]

====Input to the cardiovascular centres====
The cardiovascular centres receive input from a series of visceral receptors with impulses traveling through visceral sensory fibers within the vagus and sympathetic nerves via the cardiac plexus. Among these receptors are various [[proprioreceptor]]s, [[baroreceptor]]s, and [[chemoreceptor]]s, plus stimuli from the [[limbic system]] which normally enable the precise regulation of heart function, via cardiac reflexes. Increased physical activity results in increased rates of firing by various proprioreceptors located in muscles, joint capsules, and tendons. The cardiovascular centres monitor these increased rates of firing, suppressing parasympathetic stimulation or increasing sympathetic stimulation as needed in order to increase blood flow.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

Similarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself. Rates of firing from the baroreceptors represent blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. The cardiac centers monitor baroreceptor firing to maintain cardiac homeostasis, a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation. As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

There is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex or [[Bainbridge reflex]], associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria. Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located. However, as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure, the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase HR. The opposite is also true.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

Increased metabolic byproducts associated with increased activity, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions, and lactic acid, plus falling oxygen levels, are detected by a suite of chemoreceptors innervated by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. These chemoreceptors provide feedback to the cardiovascular centers about the need for increased or decreased blood flow, based on the relative levels of these substances.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

The limbic system can also significantly impact HR related to emotional state. During periods of stress, it is not unusual to identify higher than normal HRs, often accompanied by a surge in the stress hormone cortisol. Individuals experiencing extreme anxiety may manifest [[panic attack]]s with symptoms that resemble those of heart attacks. These events are typically transient and treatable. Meditation techniques have been developed to ease anxiety and have been shown to lower HR effectively. Doing simple deep and slow breathing exercises with one’s eyes closed can also significantly reduce this anxiety and HR.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

===Factors influencing heart rate===
{{Factors influencing heart rate}}
{{Clear}}
Using a combination of autorhythmicity and innervation, the cardiovascular center is able to provide relatively precise control over the heart rate, but other factors can impact on this. These include hormones, notably epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones; levels of various ions including calcium, potassium, and sodium; body temperature; hypoxia; and pH balance.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

====Epinephrine and norepinephrine====
The [[catecholamine]]s, epinephrine and norepinephrine, secreted by the [[adrenal medulla]] form one component of the extended fight-or-flight mechanism. The other component is sympathetic stimulation. Epinephrine and norepinephrine have similar effects: binding to the beta-1 [[adrenergic receptor]]s, and opening sodium and calcium ion chemical- or ligand-gated channels. The rate of depolarization is increased by this additional influx of positively charged ions, so the threshold is reached more quickly and the period of repolarization is shortened. However, massive releases of these hormones coupled with sympathetic stimulation may actually lead to arrhythmias. There is no parasympathetic stimulation to the adrenal medulla.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

====Thyroid hormones====
In general, increased levels of the [[thyroid hormones]] ([[thyroxine]](T4) and [[triiodothyronine]] (T3)), increase the heart rate; excessive levels can trigger [[tachycardia]]. The impact of thyroid hormones is typically of a much longer duration than that of the catecholamines. The physiologically active form of triiodothyronine, has been shown to directly enter cardiomyocytes and alter activity at the level of the genome.{{clarify|date=September 2014}} It also impacts the beta adrenergic response similar to epinephrine and norepinephrine.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

====Calcium====
Calcium ion levels have a great impact on heart rate and contractility: increased calcium levels cause an increase in both. High levels of calcium ions result in [[hypercalcemia]] and excessive levels can induce cardiac arrest. Drugs known as calcium channel blockers slow HR by binding to these channels and blocking or slowing the inward movement of calcium ions.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

====Caffeine and nicotine====
{{Expand section|date=February 2015}}
[[Caffeine]] and [[nicotine]] are both stimulants of the nervous system and of the cardiac centres causing an increased heart rate.  Caffeine works by increasing the rates of depolarization at the SA node, whereas nicotine stimulates the activity of the sympathetic neurons that deliver impulses to the heart.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt; Both stimulants are legal and unregulated, and are known to be very addictive.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

==== Effects of stress ==== 
Both surprise and stress induce physiological response: elevate heart rate substantially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mustonen|first1=Veera|last2=Pantzar|first2=Mika|title=Tracking social rhythms of the heart|journal=Approaching Religion|date=2013|volume=3|issue=2|pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted on 8 female and male student actors ages 18 to 25, their reaction to an unforeseen occurrence (the cause of stress) during a performance was observed in terms of heart rate. In the data collected, there was a noticeable trend between the location of actors (onstage and offstage) and their elevation in heart rate in response to stress; the actors present offstage reacted to the stressor immediately, demonstrated by their immediate elevation in heart the minute the unexpected event occurred, but the actors present onstage at the time of the stressor reacted in the following 5 minute period (demonstrated by their increasingly elevated heart rate). This trend regarding stress and heart rate is supported by previous studies; negative emotion/stimulus has a prolonged effect on heart rate in individuals who are directly impacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brosschot|first1=J.F.|last2=Thayer|first2=J.F.|title=Heart rate response is longer after negative emotions than after positive emotions|journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology|date=2003|volume=50|issue=3|pages=181–87|doi=10.1016/s0167-8760(03)00146-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In regard to the characters present onstage, a reduced startle response has been associated with a passive defense, and the diminished initial heart rate response has been predicted to have a greater tendency to dissociation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chou|first1=C.Y.|last2=Marca|first2=R.L.|last3=Steptoe|first3=A.|last4=Brewin|first4=C.R.|title=Heart rate, startle response, and intrusive trauma memories|journal=Psychophysiology|date=2014|volume=51|issue=3|pages=236–46|doi=10.1111/psyp.12176}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Further, note that heart rate is an accurate measure of stress and the startle response which can be easily observed to determine the effects of certain stressors.

====Factors decreasing heart rate====
The heart rate can be slowed by altered sodium and potassium levels, [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[acidosis]], [[alkalosis]], and [[hypothermia]]. The relationship between electrolytes and HR is complex, but maintaining electrolyte balance is critical to the normal wave of depolarization. Of the two ions, potassium has the greater clinical significance. Initially, both [[hyponatremia]] (low sodium levels) and [[hypernatremia]] (high sodium levels) may lead to tachycardia. Severely high hypernatremia may lead to fibrillation, which may cause CO to cease. Severe hyponatremia leads to both bradycardia and other arrhythmias. [[Hypokalemia]] (low potassium levels) also leads to arrhythmias, whereas [[hyperkalemia]] (high potassium levels) causes the heart to become weak and flaccid, and ultimately to fail.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

Heart muscle relies exclusively on aerobic metabolism for energy. Hypoxia (an insufficient supply of oxygen) leads to decreasing HRs, since metabolic reactions fueling heart contraction are restricted.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

Acidosis is a condition in which excess hydrogen ions are present, and the patient’s blood expresses a low pH value. Alkalosis is a condition in which there are too few hydrogen ions, and the patient’s blood has an elevated pH. Normal blood pH falls in the range of 7.35–7.45, so a number lower than this range represents acidosis and a higher number represents alkalosis. Enzymes, being the regulators or catalysts of virtually all biochemical reactions - are sensitive to pH and will change shape slightly with values outside their normal range. These variations in pH and accompanying slight physical changes to the active site on the enzyme decrease the rate of formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, subsequently decreasing the rate of many enzymatic reactions, which can have complex effects on HR. Severe changes in pH will lead to denaturation of the enzyme.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

The last variable is body temperature. Elevated body temperature is called [[hyperthermia]], and suppressed body temperature is called [[hypothermia]]. Slight hyperthermia results in increasing HR and strength of contraction. Hypothermia slows the rate and strength of heart contractions. This distinct slowing of the heart is one component of the larger diving reflex that diverts blood to essential organs while submerged. If sufficiently chilled, the heart will stop beating, a technique that may be employed during open heart surgery. In this case, the patient’s blood is normally diverted to an artificial heart-lung machine to maintain the body’s blood supply and gas exchange until the surgery is complete, and sinus rhythm can be restored. Excessive hyperthermia and hypothermia will both result in death, as enzymes drive the body systems to cease normal function, beginning with the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="CNX2014"/&gt;

==In different circumstances==
[[File:VivoSenseHR vs Vt.jpg|thumb|left|Heart rate (HR) (top trace) and tidal volume (Vt) (lung volume, second trace) plotted on the same chart, showing how heart rate increases with inspiration and decreases with expiration.]]
Heart rate is not a stable value and it increases or decreases in response to the body's need in a way to maintain an equilibrium ([[basal metabolic rate]]) between requirement and delivery of oxygen and nutrients. The normal SA node firing rate is affected by [[autonomic nervous system]] activity: [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic stimulation]] increases and [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic stimulation]] decreases the firing rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gOmpysGBC90C&amp;pg=PT277&amp;lpg=PT277&amp;dq=When+skeletal+muscle+is+stimulated+by+somatic+motor+axons,+influx+of+Na%2B+quickly+depolarizes+the+skeletal+myocyte|title=Human Physiology, From Cells to Systems|year=2008|last=Sherwood |first=L.|accessdate=2013-03-10 |isbn=9780495391845 |page=327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of different metrics are used to describe heart rate.

{{anchor|Resting heart rate}}

===Resting heart rate===
The basal or resting heart rate (HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined as the heart rate when a person is awake, in a neutrally [[temperate]] environment, and has not been subject to any recent exertion or stimulation, such as stress or surprise. A large body of evidence indicates that the normal range is 60-100 beats per minute.&lt;ref name=':0' /&gt;&lt;ref name=':1' /&gt;&lt;ref name=':2' /&gt;&lt;ref name=':3' /&gt; This resting heart rate is often correlated with mortality. For example, all-cause mortality is increased by 1.22 (hazard ratio) when heart rate exceeds 90 beats per minute.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The mortality rate of patients with myocardial infarction increased from 15% to 41% if their admission heart rate was greater than 90 beats per minute.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ECG of 46,129 individuals with low risk for cardiovascular disease revealed that 96% had resting heart rates ranging from 48-98 beats per minute.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Finally, expert consensus reveals that 98% of cardiologists believe that the "60 to 100" range is too high, with a vast majority of them agreeing that 50 to 90 beats per minute is more appropriate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The normal resting heart rate is based on the at-rest firing rate of the heart's [[sinoatrial node]], where the faster [[cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker cells]] driving the self-generated rhythmic firing and responsible for the heart's [[cardiac muscle#Autorhythmicity|autorhythmicity]] are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Berne| first = Robert |first2=Matthew |last2=Levy |first3=Bruce |last3=Koeppen |first4=Bruce |last4=Stanton | title = Physiology| publisher = Elsevier Mosby| year = 2004| page = 276| isbn = 0-8243-0348-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For endurance athletes at the elite level, it is not unusual to have a resting heart rate between 33 and 50 bpm.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

=== Maximum heart rate ===&lt;!-- Numerous redirects, do not change title --&gt;
The ''maximum heart rate'' (HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) is the highest heart rate an individual can achieve without severe problems through exercise stress,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HRmax (Fitness) |website=MiMi |url=http://en.mimi.hu/m/fitness/hrmax.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref name="Canadian Hockey Heart Study"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Atwal S, Porter J, MacDonald P | title = Cardiovascular effects of strenuous exercise in adult recreational hockey: the Hockey Heart Study | journal = CMAJ | volume = 166 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–07 |date=February 2002  | pmid = 11868637 | pmc = 99308 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally decreases with age. Since HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; varies by individual, the most accurate way of measuring any single person's HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is via a [[cardiac stress test]]. In this test, a person is subjected to controlled physiologic stress (generally by [[treadmill]]) while being monitored by an ECG. The intensity of exercise is periodically increased until certain changes in heart function are detected on the ECG monitor, at which point the subject is directed to stop. Typical duration of the test ranges ten to twenty minutes.

Adults who are beginning a new exercise regimen are often advised to perform this test only in the presence of medical staff due to risks associated with high heart rates. For general purposes, a formula is often employed to estimate a person's maximum heart rate. However, these predictive formulas have been criticized as inaccurate because they generalized population-averages and usually focus on a person's age.  It is well-established that there is a "poor relationship between maximal heart rate and age" and large [[standard deviations]] relative to predicted heart rates.&lt;ref name="froelicher pp.ix,108-12"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:MaximumHeartRateByAgeVariousFormulae.png|thumb|300px|The various formulae provide slightly different numbers for the maximum heart rates by age.]]

A number of formulas are used to estimate HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;

==== Nes, ''et al.'' ====
Based on measurements of 3320 healthy men and women aged between 19 and 89, and including the potential modifying effect of gender, body composition, and physical activity, Nes ''et al'' found

*HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 211 &amp;minus; (0.64 × age)

This relationship was found to hold substantially regardless of gender, physical activity status, maximal oxygen uptake, smoking, or body mass index. However, a standard error
of the estimate of 10.8 beats/min must be accounted for when applying the formula to clinical settings, and the researchers concluded that actual measurement via a maximal test may be preferable whenever possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nes |first1=B.M. |last2=Janszky |first2=I. |last3=Wisloff |first3=U. |last4=Stoylen |first4=A. |last5=Karlsen |first5=T. |title=Age‐predicted maximal heart rate in healthy subjects: The HUNT Fitness Study |journal=Scandinavian journal of medicine &amp; science in sports |volume=23 |issue=6 |date=December 2013 |pages=697–704 |pmid=22376273 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0838.2012.01445.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tanaka, Monahan, &amp; Seals ====
From Tanaka, Monahan, &amp; Seals (2001):

*HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 208 &amp;minus; (0.7 × age)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="pmid11153730"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tanaka H, Monahan KD, Seals DR | title = Age-predicted maximal heart rate revisited | journal = J.

Their meta-analysis (of 351&amp;nbsp;prior studies involving 492&amp;nbsp;groups and 18,712&amp;nbsp;subjects) and laboratory study (of 514&amp;nbsp;healthy subjects) concluded that, using this equation, HRmax was very strongly correlated to age (r = &amp;minus;0.90). The regression equation that was obtained in the laboratory-based study (209 &amp;minus; 0.7 x age), was virtually identical to that of the meta-study. The results showed HRmax to be independent of gender and independent of wide variations in habitual physical activity levels. This study found a standard deviation of ~10 beats per minute for individuals of any age, meaning the HRmax formula given has an accuracy of ±20 beats per minute.&lt;ref name=pmid11153730/&gt;

In 2007, researchers at the Oakland University analyzed maximum heart rates of 132&amp;nbsp;individuals recorded yearly over 25 years, and produced a linear equation very similar to the Tanaka formula, HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 206.9 &amp;minus; (0.67 × age), and a nonlinear equation, HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 191.5 &amp;minus; (0.007 × age&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The linear equation had a confidence interval of ±5–8&amp;nbsp;bpm and the nonlinear equation had a tighter range of ±2–5&amp;nbsp;bpm. Also a third nonlinear equation was produced: HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 163 + (1.16 × age) &amp;minus; (0.018 × age&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="pmid17468581"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gellish RL, Goslin BR, Olson RE, McDonald A, Russi GD, Moudgil VK | title = Longitudinal modeling of the relationship between age and maximal heart rate | journal = Med Sci Sports Exerc | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 822–29 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17468581 | doi = 10.1097/mss.0b013e31803349c6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|Talk page section Formulae given are NOT those in the research cited|for=formulae conflict with source cited|date=November 2016}}

==== Haskell &amp; Fox ====
[[Image:Exercise zones Fox and Haskell.svg|thumb|300px|Fox and Haskell formula; widely used.]]
Notwithstanding the research of Tanaka, Monahan, &amp; Seals, the most widely cited formula for HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;  (which contains no reference to any standard deviation) is still:

:HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 220 &amp;minus; age

Although attributed to various sources, it is widely thought to have been devised in 1970 by Dr. William Haskell and Dr. Samuel Fox.&lt;ref name="mhrt" /&gt; Inquiry into the history of this formula reveals that it was not developed from original research, but resulted from observation based on data from approximately 11 references consisting of published research or unpublished scientific compilations.&lt;ref name="mhrt2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robergs R, Landwehr R|title=The Surprising History of the 'HRmax=220-age' Equation |journal=Journal of Exercise Physiology |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=1–10 |year=2002 | url = http://www.asep.org/asep/asep/Robergs2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained widespread use through being used by [[Polar Electro]] in its heart rate monitors,&lt;ref name="mhrt" /&gt; which Dr. Haskell has "laughed about",&lt;ref name="mhrt" /&gt; as the formula "was never supposed to be an absolute guide to rule people's training."&lt;ref name="mhrt" /&gt;

While it is the most common (and easy to remember and calculate), this particular formula is not considered by reputable health and fitness professionals to be a good predictor of HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;. Despite the widespread publication of this formula, research spanning two decades reveals its large inherent error, S&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; = 7–11&amp;nbsp;bpm. Consequently, the estimation calculated by &amp;nbsp; HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 220 &amp;minus; age &amp;nbsp; has neither the accuracy nor the scientific merit for use in exercise physiology and related fields.&lt;ref name="mhrt2"/&gt;

==== Robergs &amp; Landwehr ====

A 2002 study&lt;ref name="mhrt2"/&gt; of 43&amp;nbsp;different formulas for HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (including that of Haskell and Fox &amp;ndash; see above) published in the Journal of Exercise Psychology concluded that:

# no "acceptable" formula currently existed (they used the term "acceptable" to mean acceptable for both prediction of [[VO2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and prescription of exercise training HR ranges)
# the least objectionable formula was:
::HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 205.8 &amp;minus; (0.685 × age)

:This had a [[standard deviation]] that, although large (6.4&amp;nbsp;bpm), was considered acceptable for prescribing exercise training HR ranges.

==== Gulati (for women) ====
Research conducted at Northwestern University by Martha Gulati, et al., in 2010&lt;ref name="pmid20585008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gulati M, Shaw LJ, Thisted RA, Black HR, Bairey Merz CN, Arnsdorf MF | title = Heart rate response to exercise stress testing in asymptomatic women: the st.

|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/24/health/maximum-heart-rate-theory-is-challenged.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even within a single elite sports team, such as Olympic rowers in their 20s, maximum heart rates have been reported as varying from 160 to 220.&lt;ref name="mhrt" /&gt;  Such a variation would equate to a 60 or 90&amp;nbsp;year age gap in the linear equations above, and would seem to indicate the extreme variation about these average figures.

Figures are generally considered averages, and depend greatly on individual physiology and fitness. For example, an endurance runner's rates will typically be lower due to the increased size of the heart required to support the exercise, while a sprinter's rates will be higher due to the improved response time and short duration. While each may have predicted heart rates of 180 (= 220 &amp;minus; age), these two people could have actual HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; 20&amp;nbsp;beats apart (e.g., 170–190).

Further, note that individuals of the same age, the same training, in the same sport, on the same team, can have actual HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; 60&amp;nbsp;bpm apart (160–220):&lt;ref name="mhrt" /&gt; the range is extremely broad, and some say "The heart rate is probably the least important variable in comparing athletes."&lt;ref name="mhrt" /&gt;

=== Heart rate reserve ===
''Heart rate reserve'' (HR&lt;sub&gt;reserve&lt;/sub&gt;) is the difference between a person's measured or predicted maximum heart rate and resting heart rate. Some methods of measurement of exercise intensity measure percentage of heart rate reserve. Additionally, as a person increases their cardiovascular fitness, their HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt; will drop, and the heart rate reserve will increase. Percentage of HR&lt;sub&gt;reserve&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to percentage of [[VO2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] reserve.&lt;ref name="pmid17277600"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lounana J, Campion F, Noakes TD, Medelli J | title = Relationship between %HRmax, %HR reserve, %VO2max, and %VO2 reserve in elite cyclists | journal = Med Sci Sports Exerc | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 350–57 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17277600 | doi = 10.1249/01.mss.0000246996.63976.5f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:HR&lt;sub&gt;reserve&lt;/sub&gt; = HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; − HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;

This is often used to gauge exercise intensity (first used in 1957 by Karvonen).&lt;ref name="pmid13470504"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karvonen MJ, Kentala E, Mustala O | title = The effects of training on heart rate; a longitudinal study | journal = Ann Med Exp Biol Fenn | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 307–15 | year = 1957 | pmid = 13470504 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karvonen's study findings have been questioned, due to the following:
*The study did not use VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; data to develop the equation.
*Only six subjects were used, and the correlation between the percentages of HR&lt;sub&gt;reserve&lt;/sub&gt; and VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max was not statistically significant.&lt;ref name="pmid9502363"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Swain DP, Leutholtz BC, King ME, Haas LA, Branch JD | title = Relationship between % heart rate reserve and % VO2 reserve in treadmill exercise | journal = Med Sci Sports Exerc | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 318–21 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9502363 | doi = 10.1097/00005768-199802000-00022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Target heart rate===
For healthy people, the ''Target Heart Rate'' or ''Training Heart Rate'' (THR) is a desired range of heart rate reached during [[aerobic exercise]] which enables one's [[heart]] and [[lung]]s to receive the most benefit from a workout. This theoretical range varies based mostly on age; however, a person's physical condition, sex, and previous training also are used in the calculation. Below are two ways to calculate one's THR. In each of these methods, there is an element called "intensity" which is expressed as a percentage. The THR can be calculated as a range of 65–85% intensity. However, it is crucial to derive an accurate HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; to ensure these calculations are meaningful.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

''Example for someone with a HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 180 (age 40, estimating HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; As 220 − age): ''

: 65% Intensity: (220 − (age = 40)) × 0.65 → 117 bpm
: 85% Intensity: (220 − (age = 40)) × 0.85 → 154bpm

==== Karvonen method ====

The ''Karvonen method'' factors in resting heart rate (HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;) to calculate target heart rate (THR), using a range of 50–85% intensity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karvonen J, Vuorimaa T |title=Heart rate and exercise intensity during sports activities. Practical application |journal=Sports Medicine |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=303–11 | date=May 1988 |pmid=3387734 |doi=10.2165/00007256-198805050-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: THR = ((HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; − HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;) × % intensity) + HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;
Equivalently, 
: THR = (HR&lt;sub&gt;reserve&lt;/sub&gt; × % intensity) + HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;

''Example for someone with a HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 180 and a HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt; of 70 (and therefore a HR&lt;sub&gt;reserve&lt;/sub&gt; of 110):''

: 50% Intensity: ((180 − 70) × 0.50) + 70 = 125 bpm
: 85% Intensity: ((180 − 70) × 0.85) + 70 = 163 bpm

==== Zoladz method ====

An alternative to the Karvonen method is the ''Zoladz method'', which derives exercise zones by subtracting values from HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;:

: THR = HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; − Adjuster ± 5&amp;nbsp;bpm
:: Zone 1 Adjuster = 50&amp;nbsp;bpm
:: Zone 2 Adjuster = 40&amp;nbsp;bpm
:: Zone 3 Adjuster = 30&amp;nbsp;bpm
:: Zone 4 Adjuster = 20&amp;nbsp;bpm
:: Zone 5 Adjuster = 10&amp;nbsp;bpm

''Example for someone with a HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 180:''

: Zone 1(easy exercise): 180 − 50 ± 5 → 125 − 135 bpm
: Zone 4(tough exercise): 180 − 20 ± 5 → 155 − 165 bpm

=== Heart rate recovery ===
''Heart rate recovery'' (HR&lt;sub&gt;recovery&lt;/sub&gt;) is the reduction in heart rate at peak exercise and the rate as measured after a cool-down period of fixed duration.&lt;ref name="mort" /&gt; A greater reduction in heart rate after exercise during the reference period is associated with a higher level of cardiac fitness.&lt;ref name="froelicher p114"&gt;{{cite book

Heart rates that do not drop by more than 12 bpm one minute after stopping exercise are associated with an increased risk of death.&lt;ref name="mort"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cole CR, Blackstone EH, Pashkow FJ, Snader CE, Lauer MS | title = Heart-rate recovery immediately after exercise as a predictor of mortality | journal = N.

===Development===
{{See also|Heart development}}
[[Image:EHR-BBII.jpg|thumb|left|300px|At 21 days after [[Fertilization|conception]], the human heart begins beating at 70 to 80 beats per minute and accelerates linearly for the first month of beating.]]The human heart beats more than 3.5 billion times in an average lifetime.

The [[fetal heartbeat|heartbeat]] of a human [[embryo]] begins at approximately 21 days after conception, or five weeks after the last normal [[menstrual period]] (LMP), which is the date normally used to date pregnancy in the medical community.  The electrical depolarizations that trigger cardiac [[myocyte]]s to contract arise spontaneously within the [[myocyte]] itself. The heartbeat is initiated in the pacemaker regions and spreads to the rest of the heart through a conduction pathway. Pacemaker cells develop in the primitive atrium and the sinus venosus to form the [[sinoatrial node]] and the [[atrioventricular node]] respectively. Conductive cells develop the [[bundle of His]] and carry the [[depolarization]] into the lower heart.

The human heart begins beating at a rate near the mother’s, about 75–80 beats per minute (bpm). The embryonic heart rate then accelerates linearly for the first month of beating, peaking at 165–185 bpm during the early 7th week, (early 9th week after the LMP). This acceleration is approximately 3.3 bpm per day, or about 10 bpm every three days, an increase of 100 bpm in the first month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obgyn.net/us/us.asp?page=/us/cotm/0001/ehr2000 OBGYN.net "Embryonic Heart Rates Compared in Assisted and Non-Assisted Pregnancies"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630015812/http://www.obgyn.net/us/us.asp?page=%2Fus%2Fcotm%2F0001%2Fehr2000 |date=2006-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After peaking at about 9.2 weeks after the LMP, it decelerates to about 150 bpm (+/-25 bpm) during the 15th week after the LMP. After the 15th week the deceleration slows reaching an average rate of about 145 (+/-25 bpm) bpm at term. The regression formula which describes this acceleration before the embryo reaches 25&amp;nbsp;mm in crown-rump length or 9.2 LMP weeks is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Age\ in\ days} =\ \mathrm{EHR} (0.3)+6 &lt;/math&gt;

There is no difference in male and female heart rates before birth.&lt;ref&gt;Terry J. DuBose [http://www.obgyn.net/english/pubs/features/dubose/ehr-age.htm Sex, Heart Rate and Age] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615162023/http://www.obgyn.net/english/pubs/features/dubose/ehr-age.htm |date=2012-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==

===Measurement===
[[File:Suunto t6c rannetietokone.JPG|thumb|250px|Wrist heart rate monitor]]

==== Manual measurement ====
[[File:Polar Heart Rate Monitor.jpg|thumb|250px|Heart rate monitor with a wrist receiver]]
Heart rate is measured by finding the [[pulse]] of the heart. This pulse rate can be found at any point on the body where the [[artery|artery's]] pulsation is transmitted to the surface by pressuring it with the index and middle fingers; often it is compressed against an underlying structure like bone. (A good area is on the neck, under the corner of the jaw.) The thumb should not be used for measuring another person's heart rate, as its strong pulse may interfere with the correct perception of the target pulse.

The [[radial artery]] is the easiest to use to check the heart rate. However, in emergency situations the most reliable arteries to measure heart rate are [[carotid artery|carotid arteries]]. This is important mainly in patients with [[atrial fibrillation]], in whom heart beats are irregular and [[stroke volume]] is largely different from one beat to another. In those beats following a shorter diastolic interval left ventricle doesn't fill properly, stroke volume is lower and pulse wave is not strong enough to be detected by palpation on a distal artery like the radial artery. It can be detected, however, by doppler.{{sfn|Fuster|Wayne|O'Rouke|2001|pp=824–29}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/sci_edu/waldron/heartrate.html Regulation of Human Heart Rate]. Serendip. Retrieved on June 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible points for measuring the heart rate are:
# The ventral aspect of the [[wrist]] on the side of the thumb ([[radial artery]]).
# The [[ulnar artery]].
# The [[neck]] ([[carotid artery]]).
# The inside of the [[elbow]], or under the biceps muscle ([[brachial artery]]).
# The [[groin]] ([[femoral artery]]).
# Behind the medial [[malleolus]] on the feet ([[posterior tibial artery]]).
# Middle of [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsum]] of the foot ([[dorsalis pedis]]).
# Behind the knee ([[popliteal artery]]).
# Over the [[abdomen]] ([[abdominal aorta]]).
# The chest ([[apex of the heart]]), which can be felt with one's hand or fingers. It is also possible to [[auscultate]] the heart using a [[stethoscope]].
# The [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]] ([[superficial temporal artery]]).
# The lateral edge of the mandible ([[facial artery]]).
# The side of the head near the ear ([[posterior auricular artery]]).
[[File:ECG-RRinterval.svg|thumb|250px|ECG-RRinterval]]

==== Electronic measurement ====
[[File:Embryo at 5 weeks 5 days with heartbeat.gif|thumb|150px|In [[obstetrics]], heart rate can be measured by [[obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasonography]], such as in this embryo (at bottom left in the [[gestational sac|sac]]) of 6 weeks with a heart rate of approximately 90 per minute.]]
A more precise method of determining heart rate involves the use of an [[electrocardiograph]], or ECG (also abbreviated [[EKG]]). An ECG generates a pattern based on electrical activity of the heart, which closely follows heart function. Continuous ECG monitoring is routinely done in many clinical settings, especially in [[critical care medicine]]. On the ECG, instantaneous heart rate is calculated using the R wave-to-R wave (RR) interval and multiplying/dividing in order to derive heart rate in heartbeats/min. Multiple methods exist:
* HR = 1,500/(RR interval in millimeters)
* HR = 60/(RR interval in seconds)
* HR = 300/number of "large" squares between successive R waves.
*HR=  1,500 number of large blocks 
Heart rate monitors allow measurements to be taken continuously and can be used during exercise when manual measurement would be difficult or impossible (such as when the hands are being used). Various commercial [[heart rate monitor]]s are also available. Some monitors, used during sport, consist of a chest strap with [[electrode]]s. The signal is transmitted to a wrist receiver for display.

Alternative methods of measurement include [[pulse oximetry]] and [[wiktionary:seismocardiography|seismocardiography]].&lt;ref name="pmid1914618"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salerno DM, Zanetti J | title = Seismocardiography for monitoring changes in left ventricular function during ischemia | journal = Chest | volume = 100 | issue = 4 | pages = 991–93 | year = 1991 | doi = 10.1378/chest.100.4.991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tachycardia===
{{Main|Tachycardia}}
Tachycardia is a resting heart rate more than 100 beats per minute. This number can vary as smaller people and children have faster heart rates than average adults.

Physiological conditions where tachycardia occurs:
# Pregnancy
# Emotional conditions such as anxiety or stress.

Pathological conditions where tachycardia occurs:
# Sepsis
# Fever
# Anemia 
# Hypoxia
# Hyperthyroidism
# Hypersecretion of catecholamines
# Cardiomyopathy
# Valvular heart diseases
# Acute Radiation Syndrome

===Bradycardia===
{{Main|Bradycardia|Athletic heart syndrome}}
Bradycardia was defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute when textbooks asserted that the normal range for heart rates was 60–100 bpm. The normal range has since been revised in textbooks to 50–90 bpm for a human at total rest. Setting a lower threshold for bradycardia prevents misclassification of fit individuals as having a pathologic heart rate. The normal heart rate number can vary as children and adolescents tend to have faster heart rates than average adults. Bradycardia may be associated with medical conditions such as [[hypothyroidism]].

Trained [[sportsperson|athlete]]s tend to have slow resting heart rates, and resting bradycardia in athletes should not be considered abnormal if the individual has no symptoms associated with it. For example, [[Miguel Indurain]], a Spanish cyclist and five time [[Tour de France]] winner, had a resting heart rate of 28 beats per minute,&lt;ref name=GuinessWR2004&gt;{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2004 |date=2004|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-553-58712-8|edition=Bantam|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the lowest ever recorded in a healthy human. Daniel Green achieved the world record for the slowest heartbeat in a healthy human with a heart rate of just 26 bpm in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Slowest heart rate: Daniel Green breaks Guinness World Records record |date=29 November 2014 |website=World Record Academy |url=http://www.worldrecordacademy.com/medical/slowest_heart_rate_Daniel_Green_breaks_Guinness_World_Records_record_214157.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrhythmia===
{{Main|Cardiac dysrhythmia}}
Arrhythmias are abnormalities of the heart rate and rhythm (sometimes felt as [[palpitation]]s). They can be divided into two broad categories: fast and slow heart rates.  Some cause few or minimal symptoms. Others produce more serious symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness and fainting.

===Correlation with cardiovascular mortality risk===

{{Medical citations needed|section|date=July 2015}}

A number of investigations indicate that faster resting heart rate has emerged as a new risk factor for mortality in [[homeothermic]] mammals, particularly cardiovascular mortality in human beings. Faster heart rate may accompany increased production of inflammation molecules and increased production of reactive oxygen species in cardiovascular system, in addition to increased mechanical stress to the heart. There is a correlation between increased resting rate and cardiovascular risk. This is not seen to be "using an allotment of heart beats" but rather an increased risk to the system from the increased rate.&lt;ref name="pmid19022405"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang GQ, Zhang W | title = Heart rate, lifespan, and mortality risk | journal = Ageing Res. Rev. | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 52–60 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19022405 | doi = 10.1016/j.arr.2008.10.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Australian-led international study of patients with cardiovascular disease has shown that heart beat rate is a key indicator for the risk of heart attack. The study, published in ''The Lancet'' (September 2008) studied 11,000 people, across 33 countries, who were being treated for heart problems. Those patients whose heart rate was above 70 beats per minute had significantly higher incidence of heart attacks, hospital admissions and the need for surgery. Higher heart rate is thought to be correlated with an increase in heart attack and about a 46 percent increase in hospitalizations for non-fatal or fatal heart attack.&lt;ref name="pmid18757091"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fox K, Ford I | title = Heart rate as a prognostic risk factor in patients with coronary artery disease and left-ventricular systolic dysfunction (BEAUTIFUL): a subgroup analysis of a randomised controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 372 | issue = 6 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18757091 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61171-X | pages=817–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard textbooks of physiology and medicine mention that heart rate (HR) is readily calculated from the ECG as follows:

:HR = 1,500/RR interval in millimeters, HR = 60/RR interval in seconds, or HR = 300/number of large squares between successive R waves. In each case, the authors are actually referring to instantaneous HR, which is the number of times the heart would beat if successive RR intervals were constant. However, because the above formula is almost always mentioned, students determine HR this way without looking at the ECG any further.

Lifestyle and pharmacological regimens may be beneficial to those with high resting heart rates.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Exercise is one possible measure to take when an individual's heart rate is higher than 80 beats per minute.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sloan|first=Richard P.|last2=Shapiro|first2=Peter A.|last3=DeMeersman|first3=Ronald E.|last4=Bagiella|first4=Emilia|last5=Brondolo|first5=Elizabeth N.|last6=McKinley|first6=Paula S.|last7=Slavov|first7=Iordan|last8=Fang|first8=Yixin|last9=Myers|first9=Michael M.|date=2009-05-01|title=The effect of aerobic training and cardiac autonomic regulation in young adults|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=99|issue=5|pages=921–28|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.133165|issn=1541-0048|pmc=2667843|pmid=19299682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diet has also been found to be beneficial in lowering resting heart rate: In studies of resting heart rate and risk of death and cardiac complications on patients with type 2 diabetes, legumes were found to lower resting heart rate.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=David J.

'''Niels Fabian Helge von Koch''' (25 January 1870 – 11 March 1924) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[mathematician]] who gave his name to the famous [[fractal]] known as the [[Koch snowflake]], one of the earliest fractal curves to be described.

He was born into a family of [[Swedish nobility]]. His grandfather, [[Nils Samuel von Koch]] (1801–1881), was the [[Attorney-General]] of [[Sweden]]. His father, [[Richert Vogt von Koch]] (1838–1913) was a [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] in the [[Royal Horse Guards (Sweden)|Royal Horse Guards]] of Sweden. He was enrolled at the newly created [[Stockholm University College]] in 1887 (studying under [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler]]), and at [[Uppsala University]] in 1888, where he also received his bachelor's degree (''filosofie kandidat'') since non-governmental college in Stockholm had not yet received the rights to issue degrees. He received his Ph.D. in Uppsala in 1892. He was appointed professor of mathematics at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm in 1905, succeeding [[Ivar Bendixson]], and became professor of pure mathematics at Stockholm University College in 1911.

Von Koch wrote several papers on [[number theory]]. One of his results was a 1901 theorem proving that the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is equivalent to a stronger form of the [[prime number theorem]].

He described the [[Koch snowflake|Koch curve]] in a 1904 paper entitled "On a continuous curve without tangents constructible from elementary geometry" (''original French title: "Sur une courbe continue sans tangente, obtenue par une construction géométrique élémentaire"'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=inu.30000100114564;view=1up;seq=673|author=Von Koch, Helge|title=Sur une courbe continue sans tangente, obtenue par une construction géométrique élémentaire|journal=[[Arkiv för Matematik]]|volume=1|year=1904|pages=681–704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1900 in [[Paris]] with talk ''Sur la distribution des nombres premiers''&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=miun.aag4063.0000.001;view=1up;seq=203 ''Sur la distribution des nombres premiers''], Proceedings of the ICM, 1900 v. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1912 in [[Cambridge]], England with talk ''On regular and irregular solutions of some infinite systems of linear equations''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=miun.aag4063.0001.001;view=1up;seq=354 ''On regular and irregular solutions of some infinite systems of linear equations''], Proceedings of the ICM, 1912 v. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Warn that some authors restrict isothermal coordinates to be positively oriented.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12759">In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[differential geometry]],  '''isothermal coordinates''' on a [[Riemannian manifold]] 
are local coordinates where the [[metric tensor|metric]] is
[[Conformal geometry|conformal]] to the [[Euclidean metric]]. This means that in isothermal
coordinates, the [[Riemannian metric]] locally has the form
:&lt;math&gt; g = \varphi (dx_1^2 + \cdots + dx_n^2),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a [[smooth function]].  (If the Riemannian manifold is oriented, some authors insist that a coordinate system must agree with that orientation to be isothermal.)

Isothermal coordinates on surfaces were first introduced by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]. Korn and Lichtenstein proved that isothermal coordinates exist around any point on a two dimensional Riemannian manifold. On higher-dimensional Riemannian manifolds a necessary and sufficient condition for their local existence is the vanishing of the [[Weyl tensor]] and of the [[Cotton tensor]].

==Isothermal coordinates on surfaces==
{{harvtxt|Gauss|1822}} proved the existence of isothermal coordinates on an arbitrary surface with a real analytic metric, following results of
{{harvtxt|Lagrange|1779}} on surfaces of revolution.  Results for Hölder continuous metrics were obtained by {{harvtxt|Korn|1916}} and {{harvtxt|Lichtenstein|1916}}. Later accounts were given by {{harvtxt|Morrey|1938}}, {{harvtxt|Ahlfors|1955}}, {{harvtxt|Bers|1952}} and {{harvtxt|Chern|1955}}. A particularly simple account using the [[Hodge star operator]] is given in {{harvtxt|DeTurck|Kazdan|1981}}.

===Beltrami equation===
The existence of isothermal coordinates can be proved&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Imayoshi|Taniguchi|1992|pp=20&amp;ndash;21}}&lt;/ref&gt; by applying known existence theorems for the [[Beltrami equation]], which rely on L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; estimates for [[singular integral operator]]s of [[Alberto Calderón|Calderón]] and [[Antoni Zygmund|Zygmund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahlfors|1966|pp=85&amp;ndash;115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Imayoshi|Taniguchi|1992|pp=92&amp;ndash;104}}&lt;/ref&gt; A  simpler approach to the Beltrami equation has been given more recently by the late [[Adrien Douady]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Douady|Buff|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Riemannian metric is given locally as

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = E \, dx^2 + 2F \, dx \, dy + G \, dy^2,&lt;/math&gt;

then in the complex coordinate ''z'' = ''x'' + i''y'', it takes the form

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = \lambda| \, dz +\mu \, d\overline{z}|^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where λ and μ are smooth with λ &gt; 0 and |μ| &lt; 1. In fact

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda={1\over 4} ( E + G +2\sqrt{EG -F^2}),\,\,\, \mu=(E - G + 2iF)/4\lambda.&lt;/math&gt;

In isothermal coordinates (''u'', ''v'') the metric should take the form

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = \rho (du^2 + dv^2)&lt;/math&gt;

with ρ &gt; 0 smooth. The complex coordinate ''w'' = ''u'' + i ''v'' satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \, |dw|^2 = \rho |w_{z}|^2 | \, dz + {w_{\overline {z}}\over w_z} \, d\overline{z}|^2,&lt;/math&gt;

so that the coordinates (''u'', ''v'') will be isothermal if the '''Beltrami equation'''

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial w\over \partial \overline{z}} = \mu {\partial w\over \partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

has a diffeomorphic solution. Such a solution has been proved to exist in any neighbourhood where ||μ||&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;&amp;nbsp;1.

===Hodge star operator===
New coordinates ''u'' and ''v'' are isothermal provided that

:&lt;math&gt; \star du =dv,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hodge star operator]] defined by the metric.&lt;ref name="Hodgestar"&gt;{{harvnb|DeTurck|Kazdan|1981}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1996|pp=377&amp;ndash;378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt; \Delta=d^*d&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Laplace&amp;ndash;Beltrami operator]] on functions.

Then by standard elliptic theory, ''u'' can be chosen to be [[harmonic]] near a given point, i.e. Δ ''u'' = 0,  with ''du'' non-vanishing.&lt;ref name="Hodgestar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an alternative proof using [[potential theory]] and [[singular integral operator]]s, see {{harvnb|Bers|John|Schechter|1979|pages=228−230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Indeed, since the problem is local, it is sufficient to describe a solution on the torus '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; endowed with a Riemannian metric. In this case Δ ''f'' = ''g'' can be solved near 0 with given initial values ''f''(0), ''df''(0).

:This can be proved using the L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[Sobolev space]]s ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for ''s'' ≥ 0.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Bers|John|Schechter|1979}}
*{{harvnb|Warner|1983}}
*{{harvnb|Taylor|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Hilbert spaces can be defined in terms of Δ and the Riemannian structure, but are independent of these structures. It follows that ''I'' + Δ gives a linear isomorphism from ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''s''+2&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) onto ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and that Δ ''f'' = ''g'' is solvable if and only if ''g'' is orthogonal to the constants. On the other hand standard techniques imply an approximation theorem:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hörmander|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  smooth functions which vanish in a neighbourhood of a point are dense in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for ''s'' ≤ 1 (for the method of proof, see below).

:In particular density implies that for any ''s'' &gt; 0 small there are smooth functions ''g'' equal to 0 near 1, orthogonal to the constants in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) such that the functions ''f'' = ∆&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''g'' are dense in the subspace of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''s''+2&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) orthogonal to constants. By elliptic regularity, these ''f'' are smooth. By the [[Sobolev embedding theorem]] ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''s''+2&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) lies in ''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;); density in the Sobolev space implies that ''f''(0), ''df''(0) take all possible values, as claimed.

:The approximation theorem above can be proved using the same methods as the corresponding 1-dimensional result: smooth functions which vanish in a neighbourhood of a point are dense in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T''') for ''s'' ≤ 1/2. For simplicity only this case will be described. It suffices to prove this for the point 1 on the unit circle '''T'''. By Cayley transform between the circle and the real line, functions vanishing to infinite order at 1 in ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') can be identified with ''S''('''R'''), the space of [[Schwartz function]]s on '''R'''. Smooth functions of compact support are dense in ''S''('''R'''); and hence ''A'' the space of smooth functions vanishing in a neighbourhood of 1 in ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') is dense in the space of smooth functions vanishing with all their derivatives at 1. By the [[Stone-Weierstrass theorem]], ''A'' is uniformly dense in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''\{1}). Thus if ''h'' lies in ''B'', the ideal in ''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') of functions vanishing with their derivative at 1, ''h'' and ''h' '' can be uniformly approximated by a function in ''A''. Hence ''A'' is dense in ''B''. On the other hand ''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') is in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T''') if ''s'' ≤ 1/2. To prove that ''A'' is dense in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''), it therefore suffices to show it contains functions ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;theta;}}) and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;theta;) tending to zero in Sobolev norm with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(0) = 0  vanishing at 1 and ∂&lt;sub&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(0) = 1; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(0) = 1 ad ∂&lt;sub&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(0) = 0. Suitable functions are {{math|1=''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;theta;) = sin ''n''&amp;theta;&lt;/sup&gt; / ''n''}} and {{math|1=''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;theta;) = ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;theta;) / ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(0)}} where {{math|1=''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;theta;) = ∑ (1 − ''n''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; cos ''k''&amp;theta;}} / ''k'' log ''k''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zygmund|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Poincaré lemma]] &lt;math&gt;\star du=dv&lt;/math&gt; has a local solution ''v'' exactly when &lt;math&gt;d\star d u =0&lt;/math&gt;.

Since

:&lt;math&gt;\star d \star = d^*,&lt;/math&gt;

this is equivalent to Δ&amp;nbsp;''u'' =&amp;nbsp;0, and hence a local solution exists.

Since ''du'' is non-zero and the square of the Hodge star operator is &amp;minus;1 on 1-forms, ''du'' and ''dv'' are necessarily linearly independent, and therefore ''u'' and ''v'' give local isothermal coordinates.

===Gaussian curvature===
In the isothermal coordinates (''u'', ''v''), the [[Gaussian curvature]] takes the simpler form

: &lt;math&gt; K = -\frac{1}{2} e^{-\rho} \left(\frac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial u^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial v^2}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \varphi = e^\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Jean Louis Maxime van Heijenoort''' ({{IPAc-en|v|æ|n|_|ˈ|h|aɪ|.|ə|n|ɔː|r|t}}; {{IPA-fr|van ɛjɛnɔʁt|lang}}; July 23, 1912 – March 29, 1986) was a pioneer historian of [[mathematical logic]]. He was also a personal secretary to [[Leon Trotsky]] from 1932 to 1939, and from then until 1947, an American [[Trotskyist]] activist.

==Life==
Van Heijenoort was born in [[Creil]], France. His family's financial circumstances were difficult as his Dutch immigrant father died when van Heijenoort was two. He nevertheless acquired a powerful traditional French formal education, to which his French writings attest. (He also published in Spanish.) Although he eventually became a [[naturalization|naturalized]] American citizen, he visited France twice a year from 1958 until his death, and remained very attached to his French extended family and friends.

===Political views===
In 1932, he joined the [[Trotskyist]] movement (recruited by [[Yvan Craipeau]]) and the [[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|Communist League]]. Very soon thereafter, the recently exiled [[Trotsky]] hired van Heijenoort as a [[secretary]] and bodyguard, primarily because of his fluency in French, [[Russian language|Russian]], German, and English. Thus began seven years in Trotsky's household, during which he served as an all-purpose translator, helping Trotsky write several books and keep up an extensive intellectual and political correspondence in several languages.

In 1939, van Heijenoort moved to [[New York City]] to be with his second wife, Beatrice "Bunny" Guyer, where he worked for the [[Socialist Workers Party (US)]] (SWP) and wrote a number of articles for the American Trotskyist press and other [[Radicalization|radical]] outlets. He was elected to the secretariat of the [[Fourth International]] in 1940 but resigned when [[Felix Morrow]] and [[Albert Goldman (politician)|Albert Goldman]], with whom he had sided, were expelled from the SWP. Goldman subsequently went on to join the [[Workers Party (US)|US Workers Party]] but Morrow joined no other party/grouping. In 1947, he too was expelled from the SWP. In 1948, he published an article, called [https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/heijen/1948/03/balancesheet.html "A Century's Balance Sheet"] in which he criticized that part of  [[Marxism]] which saw the "proletariat" as the revolutionary class. He continued to hold other parts of Marxism as true.

Van Heijenoort was spared the ordeal of [[McCarthyism]] because everything he published in Trotskyist organs appeared under one or other of more than a dozen pen names.[http://www.trotskyana.net/Trotsky_Collection/Trotskyists/Miscellanies/bio-bibl_vanheijenoort.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Moreover, Feferman (1993) states that van Heijenoort the logician was quite reticent about his Trotskyist youth, and did not discuss politics. Nevertheless, in the last decade of his life he contributed to the history of the Trotskyist movement by writing the monograph ''With Trotsky in Exile'' (1978), editing a volume of Trotsky's correspondence (1980), and advising and working with the archivists at the [[Houghton Library]] in [[Harvard University]], which holds many of Trotsky's papers from his years in exile.

===Academic work===
After completing a Ph.D. in [[mathematics]] at [[New York University]] in 1949 under the supervision of [[James J. Stoker|J. J. Stoker]], he taught mathematics there but evolved into a logician and philosopher of mathematics, in good part because of the influence of [[Georg Kreisel]]. He began teaching philosophy, first part-time at [[Columbia University]], then full-time at [[Brandeis University]], 1965-77.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/11/obituaries/jean-van-heijenoort-former-trotsky-aide.html|title=Jean Van Heijenoort, Former Trotsky Aide|date=1986-04-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-01|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of his last decade at [[Stanford University]], writing and editing eight books, including parts of the ''Collected Works'' of [[Kurt Gödel]].

The ''Source Book'' (van Heijenoort 1967), perhaps the most important book ever published on the [[history of logic]] and of the [[foundations of mathematics]], is an anthology of translations. It begins with the first complete translation of [[Frege]]'s 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', which is followed by 45 historically important short pieces on [[mathematical logic]] and [[axiomatic set theory]], originally published between 1889 and 1931. The anthology ends with [[Gödel]]'s landmark paper on the [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompletability of Peano arithmetic]]. For more information on the period covered by this anthology, see Grattan-Guinness (2000).

Nearly all the content of the ''Source Book'' was difficult to access in all but the best North American university libraries (e.g., even the [[Library of Congress]] did not acquire a copy of the ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' until 1964), and all but four pieces had to be translated from one of six continental European languages. When possible, the author of the original text was asked to review the translation of his work, and suggest corrections and amendments. Each piece included editorial footnotes, all references were combined into one list, and many misprints, inconsistencies, and errors in the originals were corrected. Especially important are the remarkable introductions to each translation, most written by van Heijenoort himself. A few were written by [[Willard Quine]] and [[Burton Dreben]].

The ''Source Book'' did much to advance the view that modern logic begins with, and builds on, the ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''.  Grattan-Guinness (2000) argues that this perspective on the history of logic is mistaken, because Frege employed an idiosyncratic notation and was far less read than, say, [[Peano]]. Ironically, van Heijenoort (1967a) is often cited by those who prefer the alternative [[model theory|model theoretic]] stance on logic and mathematics. Much of the history of that stance, whose leading lights include [[George Boole]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Ernst Schröder]], [[Leopold Löwenheim]], [[Thoralf Skolem]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and [[Jaakko Hintikka]], is covered in Brady (2000). The ''Source Book'' underrated the algebraic logic of De Morgan, Boole, Peirce, and Schröder, but devoted more pages to Skolem than to anyone other than Frege, and included Löwenheim (1915), the founding paper on model theory.

===Personal life===
Van Heijenoort had children with two of his four wives. While living with Trotsky in [[Coyoacán]], now a neighborhood of [[Mexico City]], van Heijenoort's first wife left him after clashing with Trotsky's spouse. Van Heijenoort was also one of [[Frida Kahlo]]'s lovers; in the film ''[[Frida]]'', he is played by [[Felipe Fulop]]. Having parted company with Trotsky in 1939 for personal reasons, van Heijenoort was innocent of all circumstances leading to Trotsky's 1940 murder. Van Heijenoort himself was also murdered, in [[Mexico City]] 46 years later, by his estranged fourth spouse whom he was visiting at the time. She then took her own life.

      <comment>/* Jets of functions between two manifolds */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25018">In [[mathematics]], the '''jet''' is an operation that takes a [[differentiable function]] ''f'' and produces a [[polynomial]], the truncated [[Taylor polynomial]] of ''f'', at each point of its domain. Although this is the definition of a jet, the theory of jets regards these polynomials as being [[Polynomials#Abstract algebra|abstract polynomials]] rather than polynomial functions.

This article first explores the notion of a jet of a real valued function in one real variable, followed by a discussion of generalizations to several real variables. It then gives a rigorous construction of jets and jet spaces between [[Euclidean space]]s. It concludes with a description of jets between [[manifold]]s, and how these jets can be constructed intrinsically. In this more general context, it summarizes some of the applications of jets to [[differential geometry]] and the theory of [[differential equations]].

==Jets of functions between Euclidean spaces==

Before giving a rigorous definition of a jet, it is useful to examine some special cases.

===One-dimensional case===

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f: {\mathbb R}\rightarrow{\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued function having at least ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 [[derivative]]s in a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] ''U'' of the point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;. Then by Taylor's theorem,

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0)+\cdots+\frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}(x-x_0)^{k}+\frac{R_{k+1}(x)}{(k+1)!}(x-x_0)^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;|R_{k+1}(x)|\le\sup_{x\in U} |f^{(k+1)}(x)|.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the '''''k''-jet''' of ''f'' at the point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;(J^k_{x_0}f)(z)=f(x_0)+f'(x_0)z+\cdots+\frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}z^k.&lt;/math&gt;

Jets are normally regarded as [[Polynomial#Abstract algebra|abstract polynomials]] in the variable ''z'', not as actual polynomial functions in that variable. In other words, ''z'' is an [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate variable]] allowing one to perform various [[abstract algebra|algebraic operations]] among the jets. It is in fact the base-point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; from which jets derive their functional dependency. Thus, by varying the base-point, a jet yields a polynomial of order at most ''k'' at every point. This marks an important conceptual distinction between jets and truncated Taylor series: ordinarily a Taylor series is regarded as depending functionally on its variable, rather than its base-point. Jets, on the other hand, separate the algebraic properties of Taylor series from their functional properties. We shall deal with the reasons and applications of this separation later in the article.

===Mappings from one Euclidean space to another===
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f:{\mathbb R}^n\rightarrow{\mathbb R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is a function from one Euclidean space to another having at least (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) derivatives. In this case, [[Taylor's theorem]] asserts that

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f(x)=f(x_0)+ (Df(x_0))\cdot(x-x_0)+ {} &amp; \frac{1}{2}(D^2f(x_0))\cdot (x-x_0)^{\otimes 2} + \cdots \\[4pt]
&amp; \cdots +\frac{D^kf(x_0)}{k!}\cdot(x-x_0)^{\otimes k}+\frac{R_{k+1}(x)}{(k+1)!}\cdot(x-x_0)^{\otimes (k+1)}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The ''k''-jet of ''f'' is then defined to be the polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;(J^k_{x_0}f)(z)=f(x_0)+(Df(x_0))\cdot z+\frac{1}{2}(D^2f(x_0))\cdot z^{\otimes 2} + \cdots + \frac{D^kf(x_0)}{k!}\cdot z^{\otimes k}&lt;/math&gt;

in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}[z]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;z=(z_1,\ldots,z_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Algebraic properties of jets===

There are two basic algebraic structures jets can carry. The first is a product structure, although this ultimately turns out to be the least important. The second is the structure of the composition of jets.

If &lt;math&gt;f,g:{\mathbb R}^n\rightarrow {\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; are a pair of real-valued functions, then we can define the product of their jets via

:&lt;math&gt;J^k_{x_0}f\cdot J^k_{x_0}g=J^k_{x_0}(f\cdot g).&lt;/math&gt;

Here we have suppressed the indeterminate ''z'', since it is understood that jets are formal polynomials. This product is just the product of ordinary polynomials in ''z'', [[modulo (jargon)|modulo]] &lt;math&gt;z^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, it is multiplication in the ring &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}[z]/(z^{k+1})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(z^{k+1})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by polynomials homogeneous of order&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

We now move to the composition of jets. To avoid unnecessary technicalities, we consider jets of functions that map the origin to the origin. If &lt;math&gt;f:{\mathbb R}^m\rightarrow{\mathbb R}^\ell&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:{\mathbb R}^n\rightarrow{\mathbb R}^m&lt;/math&gt; with ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''g''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, then &lt;math&gt;f\circ g:{\mathbb R}^n \rightarrow{\mathbb R}^\ell&lt;/math&gt;. The ''composition of jets'' is defined by
&lt;math&gt;J^k_0 f\circ J^k_0 g=J^k_0 (f\circ g).&lt;/math&gt;
It is readily verified, using the [[chain rule]], that this constitutes an associative noncommutative operation on the space of jets at the origin.

In fact, the composition of ''k''-jets is nothing more than the composition of polynomials modulo the ideal of polynomials homogeneous of order &lt;math&gt;&gt; k&lt;/math&gt;.

''Examples:''
*In one dimension, let &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\log(1-x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x)=\sin\,x&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt;(J^3_0f)(x)=-x-\frac{x^2}{2}-\frac{x^3}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(J^3_0g)(x)=x-\frac{x^3}{6}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; (J^3_0f)\circ (J^3_0g)=-\left(x-\frac{x^3}{6}\right)-\frac{1}{2}\left(x-\frac{x^3}{6}\right)^2-\frac{1}{3} \left(x-\frac{x^3}{6}\right)^3 \pmod{x^4} \\[4pt]
= {} &amp; -x-\frac{x^2}{2}-\frac{x^3}{6}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Jets at a point in Euclidean space: rigorous definitions==
This subsection focuses on two different rigorous definitions of the jet of a function at a point, followed by a discussion of Taylor's theorem. These definitions shall prove to be useful later on during the intrinsic definition of the jet of a function between two manifolds.

===Analytic definition===
The following definition uses ideas from [[mathematical analysis]] to define jets and jet spaces. It can be generalized to [[smooth functions]] between [[Banach spaces]], [[analytic functions]] between real or [[complex analysis|complex domains]], to [[p-adic analysis]], and to other areas of analysis.

Let &lt;math&gt;C^\infty({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^m)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[vector space]] of [[smooth function]]s &lt;math&gt;f:{\mathbb R}^n\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^m&lt;/math&gt;. Let ''k'' be a non-negative integer, and let ''p'' be a point of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. We define an [[equivalence relation]] &lt;math&gt;E_p^k&lt;/math&gt; on this space by declaring that two functions ''f'' and ''g'' are equivalent to order ''k'' if ''f'' and ''g'' have the same value at ''p'', and all of their [[partial derivative]]s agree at ''p'' up to (and including) their ''k''-th-order derivatives. In short,&lt;math&gt;f \sim g \,\!&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt; f-g = 0 &lt;/math&gt; to ''k''-th order.

The '''''k''-th-order jet space''' of &lt;math&gt;C^\infty({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^m)&lt;/math&gt; at ''p'' is defined to be the set of equivalence classes of &lt;math&gt;E^k_p&lt;/math&gt;, and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;J^k_p({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^m)&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''''k''-th-order jet''' at ''p'' of a smooth function &lt;math&gt;f\in C^\infty({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^m)&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the equivalence class of ''f'' in &lt;math&gt;J^k_p({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^m)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Algebraic-geometric definition===
The following definition uses ideas from [[algebraic geometry]] and [[commutative algebra]] to establish the notion of a jet and a jet space. Although this definition is not particularly suited for use in algebraic geometry per se, since it is cast in the smooth category, it can easily be tailored to such uses.

Let &lt;math&gt;C_p^\infty({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^m)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[vector space]] of [[germ (mathematics)|germs]] of [[smooth function]]s &lt;math&gt;f:{\mathbb R}^n\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^m&lt;/math&gt; at a point ''p'' in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak m}_p&lt;/math&gt; be the ideal of functions that vanish at ''p''. (This is the [[maximal ideal]] for the [[local ring]] &lt;math&gt;C_p^\infty({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^m)&lt;/math&gt;.) Then the ideal &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak m}_p^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; consists of all function germs that vanish to order ''k'' at ''p''. We may now define the '''jet space''' at ''p'' by

:&lt;math&gt;J^k_p({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^m)=C_p^\infty({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^m)/{\mathfrak m}_p^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f:{\mathbb R}^n\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth function, we may define the ''k''-jet of ''f'' at ''p'' as the element of &lt;math&gt;J^k_p({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^m)&lt;/math&gt; by setting

:&lt;math&gt;J^k_pf=f \pmod {{\mathfrak m}_p^{k+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
This is a more general construction. For an [[Locally ringed space|&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}&lt;/math&gt;-space]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_p&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Stalk (sheaf)|stalk]] of the [[structure sheaf]] at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak m}_p&lt;/math&gt; be the [[maximal ideal]] of the [[local ring]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_p&lt;/math&gt;. The kth jet space at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the ring &lt;math&gt;J^k_p(M)=\mathcal{F}_p/{\mathfrak m}_p^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak m}_p^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ideal (ring theory)#Ideal operations|product of ideals]]).

===Taylor's theorem===
Regardless of the definition, Taylor's theorem establishes a canonical isomorphism of vector spaces between &lt;math&gt;J^k_p({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^m[z_1, \dotsc, z_n]/(z_1, \dotsc, z_n)^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;. So in the Euclidean context, jets are typically identified with their polynomial representatives under this isomorphism.

===Jet spaces from a point to a point===
We have defined the space &lt;math&gt;J^k_p({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^m)&lt;/math&gt; of jets at a point &lt;math&gt;p\in {\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. The subspace of this consisting of jets of functions ''f'' such that ''f''(''p'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''q'' is denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;J^k_p({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^m)_q=\left\{J^kf\in J^k_p({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^m) \mid f(p) = q \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

== Jets of functions between two manifolds ==

If ''M'' and ''N'' are two [[differentiable manifold|smooth manifolds]], how do we define the jet of a function &lt;math&gt;f:M\rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt;? We could perhaps attempt to define such a jet by using [[manifold|local coordinates]] on ''M'' and ''N''. The disadvantage of this is that jets cannot thus be defined in an [[equivariant]] fashion. Jets do not transform as [[tensors]]. Instead, jets of functions between two manifolds belong to a [[jet bundle]].

This section begins by introducing the notion of jets of functions from the real line to a manifold. It proves that such jets form a [[fibre bundle]], analogous to the [[tangent bundle]], which is an associated bundle of a [[jet group]]. It proceeds to address the problem of defining the jet of a function between two smooth manifolds. Throughout this section, we adopt an analytic approach to jets. Although an algebro-geometric approach is also suitable for many more applications, it is too subtle to be dealt with systematically here. See [[Jet (mathematics)#Algebraic-geometric definition|jet (algebraic geometry)]] for more details.

===Jets of functions from the real line to a manifold===
Suppose that ''M'' is a smooth manifold containing a point ''p''. We shall define the jets of [[curve]]s through ''p'', by which we henceforth mean smooth functions &lt;math&gt;f:{\mathbb R}\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; such that ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''. Define an equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;E_p^k&lt;/math&gt; as follows. Let ''f'' and ''g'' be a pair of curves through ''p''. We will then say that ''f'' and ''g'' are equivalent to order ''k'' at ''p'' if there is some [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] ''U'' of ''p'', such that, for every smooth function &lt;math&gt;\varphi : U \rightarrow {\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J^k_0 (\varphi\circ f)=J^k_0 (\varphi\circ g)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that these jets are well-defined since the composite functions &lt;math&gt;\varphi\circ f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi\circ g&lt;/math&gt; are just mappings from the real line to itself. This equivalence relation is sometimes called that of ''k''-th-order [[contact (mathematics)|contact]] between curves at ''p''.

We now define the '''''k''-jet''' of a curve ''f'' through ''p'' to be the equivalence class of ''f'' under &lt;math&gt;E^k_p&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;J^k\! f\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;J^k_0f&lt;/math&gt;. The '''''k''-th-order jet space''' &lt;math&gt;J^k_0({\mathbb R},M)_p&lt;/math&gt; is then the set of ''k''-jets at ''p''.
 
As ''p'' varies over ''M'', &lt;math&gt;J^k_0({\mathbb R},M)_p&lt;/math&gt; forms a [[fibre bundle]] over ''M'': the ''k''-th-order [[tangent bundle]], often denoted in the literature by ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' (although this notation occasionally can lead to confusion). In the case ''k''=1, then the first-order tangent bundle is the usual tangent bundle: ''T''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''TM''.

To prove that ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' is in fact a fibre bundle, it is instructive to examine the properties of &lt;math&gt;J^k_0({\mathbb R},M)_p&lt;/math&gt; in local coordinates. Let (''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;)= (''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) be a local coordinate system for ''M'' in a neighborhood ''U'' of ''p''. [[abuse of notation|Abusing notation]] slightly, we may regard (''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;) as a local [[diffeomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;(x^i):M\rightarrow\R^n&lt;/math&gt;.

''Claim.'' Two curves ''f'' and ''g'' through ''p'' are equivalent modulo &lt;math&gt;E_p^k&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;J^k_0\left((x^i)\circ f\right)=J^k_0\left((x^i)\circ g\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

:Indeed, the ''only if'' part is clear, since each of the ''n'' functions ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a smooth function from ''M'' to &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt;. So by the definition of the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;E_p^k&lt;/math&gt;, two equivalent curves must have &lt;math&gt;J^k_0(x^i\circ f)=J^k_0(x^i\circ g)&lt;/math&gt;.

:Conversely, suppose that &amp;phi; is a smooth real-valued function on ''M'' in a neighborhood of ''p''. Since every smooth function has a local coordinate expression, we may express &amp;phi; as a function in the coordinates. Specifically, if ''Q'' is a point of ''M'' near ''p'', then

::&lt;math&gt;\varphi(Q)=\psi(x^1(Q),\dots,x^n(Q))&lt;/math&gt;

:for some smooth real-valued function &amp;psi; of ''n'' real variables. Hence, for two curves ''f'' and ''g'' through ''p'', we have

::&lt;math&gt;\varphi\circ f=\psi(x^1\circ f,\dots,x^n\circ f)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\varphi\circ g=\psi(x^1\circ g,\dots,x^n\circ g)&lt;/math&gt;

:The chain rule now establishes the ''if'' part of the claim. For instance, if ''f'' and ''g'' are functions of the real variable ''t'' , then

::&lt;math&gt;\left. \frac{d}{dt} \left( \varphi\circ f \right) (t) \right|_{t=0}= \sum_{i=1}^n\left.\frac{d}{dt}(x^i\circ f)(t)\right|_{t=0}\ (D_i\psi)\circ f(0)&lt;/math&gt;

:which is equal to the same expression when evaluated against ''g'' instead of ''f'', recalling that ''f''(0)=''g''(0)=p and ''f'' and ''g'' are in ''k''-th-order contact in the coordinate system (''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;).

Hence the ostensible fibre bundle ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' admits a local trivialization in each coordinate neighborhood. At this point, in order to prove that this ostensible fibre bundle is in fact a fibre bundle, it suffices to establish that it has non-singular transition functions under a change of coordinates. Let &lt;math&gt;(y^i):M\rightarrow{\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be a different coordinate system and let &lt;math&gt;\rho=(x^i)\circ (y^i)^{-1}:{\mathbb R}^n\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be the associated [[change of coordinates]] diffeomorphism of Euclidean space to itself. By means of an [[affine transformation]] of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, we may assume [[without loss of generality]] that ρ(0)=0. With this assumption, it suffices to prove that &lt;math&gt;J^k_0\rho:J^k_0({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^n)\rightarrow J^k_0({\mathbb R}^n,{\mathbb R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; is an invertible transformation under jet composition. (See also [[jet group]]s.) But since ρ is a diffeomorphism, &lt;math&gt;\rho^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth mapping as well. Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;I=J^k_0I=J^k_0(\rho\circ\rho^{-1})=J^k_0(\rho)\circ J^k_0(\rho^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;

which proves that &lt;math&gt;J^k_0\rho&lt;/math&gt; is non-singular. Furthermore, it is smooth, although we do not prove that fact here.

Intuitively, this means that we can express the jet of a curve through ''p'' in terms of its Taylor series in local coordinates on ''M''.

''Examples in local coordinates:''

* As indicated previously, the 1-jet of a curve through ''p'' is a tangent vector. A tangent vector at ''p'' is a first-order [[differential operator]] acting on smooth real-valued functions at ''p''. In local coordinates, every tangent vector has the form

::&lt;math&gt;v=\sum_iv^i\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}&lt;/math&gt;

:Given such a tangent vector ''v'', let ''f'' be the curve given in the ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; coordinate system by &lt;math&gt;x^i\circ f(t)=tv^i&lt;/math&gt;. If ''&amp;phi;'' is a smooth function in a neighborhood of ''p'' with ''&amp;phi;''(''p'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, then

::&lt;math&gt;\varphi\circ f:{\mathbb R}\rightarrow {\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt;

:is a smooth real-valued function of one variable whose 1-jet is given by

::&lt;math&gt;J^1_0(\varphi\circ f)(t)=tv^i \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x^i}(p).&lt;/math&gt;

:which proves that one can naturally identify tangent vectors at a point with the 1-jets of curves through that point.

* The space of 2-jets of curves through a point.
: In a local coordinate system ''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' centered at a point ''p'', we can express the second-order Taylor polynomial of a curve ''f''(''t'') by

::&lt;math&gt;x^i(t)=t\frac{dx^i}{dt}(0)+\frac{t^2}{2}\frac{d^2x^i}{dt^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

:So in the ''x'' coordinate system, the 2-jet of a curve through ''p'' is identified with a list of real numbers &lt;math&gt;(\dot{x}^i,\ddot{x}^i)&lt;/math&gt;. As with the tangent vectors (1-jets of curves) at a point, 2-jets of curves obey a transformation law upon application of the coordinate transition functions.

:Let (''y''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;) be another coordinate system. By the chain rule,

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}y^i(x(t)) &amp; = \frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^j}(x(t))\frac{dx^j}{dt}(t) \\[5pt]
\frac{d^2}{dt^2}y^i(x(t)) &amp; = \frac{\partial^2 y^i}{\partial x^j \, \partial x^k}(x(t))\frac{dx^j}{dt}(t) \frac{dx^k}{dt}(t)+\frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^j}(x(t))\frac{d^2x^j}{dt^2}(t)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:Hence, the transformation law is given by evaluating these two expressions at ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \dot{y}^i=\frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^j}(0)\dot{x}^j \\[5pt]
&amp; \ddot{y}^i=\frac{\partial^2 y^i}{\partial x^j \, \partial x^k}(0)\dot{x}^j\dot{x}^k+\frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^k}(0)\ddot{x}^k.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:Note that the transformation law for 2-jets is second-order in the coordinate transition functions.

===Jets of functions from a manifold to a manifold===
We are now prepared to define the jet of a function from a manifold to a manifold.

Suppose that ''M'' and ''N'' are two smooth manifolds. Let ''p'' be a point of ''M''. Consider the space &lt;math&gt;C^\infty_p(M,N)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of smooth maps &lt;math&gt;f:M\rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; defined in some neighborhood of ''p''. We define an equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;E^k_p&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;C^\infty_p(M,N)&lt;/math&gt; as follows. Two maps ''f'' and ''g'' are said to be ''equivalent'' if, for every curve γ through ''p'' (recall that by our conventions this is a mapping &lt;math&gt;\gamma:{\mathbb R}\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\gamma(0)=p&lt;/math&gt;), we have &lt;math&gt;J^k_0(f\circ \gamma)=J^k_0(g\circ \gamma)&lt;/math&gt; on some neighborhood of ''0''.

The jet space &lt;math&gt;J^k_p(M,N)&lt;/math&gt; is then defined to be the set of equivalence classes of &lt;math&gt;C^\infty_p(M,N)&lt;/math&gt; modulo the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;E^k_p&lt;/math&gt;. Note that because the target space ''N'' need not possess any algebraic structure, &lt;math&gt;J^k_p(M,N)&lt;/math&gt; also need not have such a structure. This is, in fact, a sharp contrast with the case of Euclidean spaces.

If &lt;math&gt;f:M\rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth function defined near ''p'', then we define the ''k''-jet of ''f'' at ''p'', &lt;math&gt;J^k_pf&lt;/math&gt;, to be the equivalence class of ''f'' modulo &lt;math&gt;E^k_p&lt;/math&gt;.

===Multijets===
[[John Mather (mathematician)|John Mather]] introduced the notion of ''multijet''. Loosely speaking, a multijet is a finite list of jets over different base-points. Mather proved the multijet [[transversality theorem]], which he used in his study of [[stable mapping]]s.

==Jets of sections==
This subsection deals with the notion of jets of local sections of a [[vector bundle]]. Almost everything in this section generalizes [[mutatis mutandis]] to the case of local sections of a [[fibre bundle]], a [[Banach bundle]] over a [[Banach manifold]], a [[fibered manifold]], or [[quasi-coherent|quasi-coherent sheaves]] over [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. Furthermore, these examples of possible generalizations are certainly not exhaustive.

Suppose that ''E'' is a finite-dimensional smooth vector bundle over a manifold ''M'', with projection &lt;math&gt;\pi:E\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt;. Then sections of ''E'' are smooth functions &lt;math&gt;s:M\rightarrow E&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\pi\circ s&lt;/math&gt; is the identity [[automorphism]] of ''M''. The jet of a section ''s'' over a neighborhood of a point ''p'' is just the jet of this smooth function from ''M'' to ''E'' at ''p''.

The space of jets of sections at ''p'' is denoted by &lt;math&gt;J^k_p(M,E)&lt;/math&gt;. Although this notation can lead to confusion with the more general jet spaces of functions between two manifolds, the context typically eliminates any such ambiguity.

Unlike jets of functions from a manifold to another manifold, the space of jets of sections at ''p'' carries the structure of a vector space inherited from the vector space structure on the sections themselves. As ''p'' varies over ''M'', the jet spaces &lt;math&gt;J^k_p(M,E)&lt;/math&gt; form a vector bundle over ''M'', the ''k''-th-order [[jet bundle]] of ''E'', denoted by ''J''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'').

* ''Example: The first-order jet bundle of the tangent bundle.''
:We work in local coordinates at a point. Consider a vector field

::&lt;math&gt;v=v^i(x)\partial/\partial x^i&lt;/math&gt;

:in a neighborhood of ''p'' in ''M''. The 1-jet of ''v'' is obtained by taking the first-order Taylor polynomial of the coefficients of the vector field:

::&lt;math&gt;v^i(x)=v^i(0)+x^j\frac{\partial v^i}{\partial x^j}(0)=v^i+v^i_jx^j.&lt;/math&gt;

:In the ''x'' coordinates, the 1-jet at a point can be identified with a list of real numbers &lt;math&gt;(v^i,v^i_j)&lt;/math&gt;. In the same way that a tangent vector at a point can be identified with the list (''v&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''), subject to a certain transformation law under coordinate transitions, we have to know how the list &lt;math&gt;(v^i,v^i_j)&lt;/math&gt; is affected by a transition.

:So let us consider the transformation law in passing to another coordinate system ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;. Let ''w&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' be the coefficients of the vector field ''v'' in the ''y'' coordinates. Then in the ''y'' coordinates, the 1-jet of ''v'' is a new list of real numbers &lt;math&gt;(w^i,w^i_j)&lt;/math&gt;. Since

::&lt;math&gt;v=w^k(y)\partial/\partial y^k=v^i(x)\partial/\partial x^i,&lt;/math&gt;

:it follows that

::&lt;math&gt;w^k(y)=v^i(x)\frac{\partial y^k}{\partial x^i}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

:So

::&lt;math&gt;w^k(0)+y^j\frac{\partial w^k}{\partial y^j}(0)=\left(v^i(0)+x^j\frac{\partial v^i}{\partial x^j}\right)\frac{\partial y^k}{\partial x^i}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:Expanding by a Taylor series, we have

::&lt;math&gt;w^k=\frac{\partial y^k}{\partial x^i}(0) v^i&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;w^k_j=v^i\frac{\partial^2 y^k}{\partial x^i \, \partial x^j}+v_j^i\frac{\partial y^k}{\partial x^i}. &lt;/math&gt;

:Note that the transformation law is second-order in the coordinate transition functions.

In [[graph theory]], a '''''k''-tree''' is an [[undirected graph]] formed by starting with a (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-vertex [[complete graph]] and then repeatedly adding vertices in such a way that each added vertex ''v'' has exactly ''k'' neighbors ''U'' such that, together, the ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 vertices formed by ''v'' and ''U'' form a [[clique (graph theory)|clique]].&lt;ref name="patil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bridges"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3183">'''Laura Guggenbühl''' (November 18, 1901 – March 8, 1985) was an American mathematician, one of the earliest women in the U.S. to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics, known for her work in [[triangle geometry]] and the [[history of mathematics]].{{r|pw}}

Guggenbühl was born in [[New York City]], to a family of Swiss immigrants; her father, a butcher and baker, died by 1920. She graduated from [[Hunter College]] in 1922 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics, after also taking some classes at [[Columbia University]] and [[New York University]]. She became an instructor at Hunter College while earning a master's degree and Ph.D. from [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1924 and 1926 respectively.{{r|pw}} Her dissertation, supervised by [[Anna Johnson Pell Wheeler]], was ''An Integral Equation with an Associated Integral Condition''.{{r|mgp}} She became a regular-rank faculty member at Hunter College in 1932 and retired from there as an associate professor in 1972.{{r|pw}}

Although not active in research mathematics after her doctorate, Guggenbühl represented Hunter College at many offerings of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]]. She
also published several works on the history of mathematics, including biographies of [[Henri Brocard]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach]], on elementary geometry including [[triangle geometry]], and on the [[Rhind mathematical papyrus]].{{r|pw}}

She died on a round-the-world cruise, shortly after leaving [[Hong Kong]], after being overcome with grief at the recent death of her brother.{{r|pw}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4026">In [[mathematics]], ideas are supposedly not accepted as fact until they have been rigorously proved. However, there have been some ideas that were fairly accepted in the past but which were subsequently shown to be false. This article is meant to serve as a repository for compiling a list of such ideas.

*The idea of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] that all numbers can be expressed as a ratio of two [[integer|whole number]]s. This was disproved by one of [[Pythagoras]]' own disciples, [[Hippasus]], who showed that the square root of two is what we today call an [[irrational number]]. One story claims that he was thrown off the ship in which he and some other Pythagoreans were sailing because his discovery was too heretical.
*[[Fermat]] conjectured that all numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;2^{2^m}+1&lt;/math&gt; (what we call [[Fermat number]]s) were prime. This, however, was disproved by [[Euler]].
*The idea that [[transcendental number]]s were unusual. Disproved by [[Georg Cantor]] who [[Cantor's first uncountability proof|showed]] that there are so many transcendental numbers that it is impossible to make a one-to-one mapping between them and the [[algebraic number]]s. In other words, the [[cardinality]] of the set of transcendentals (denoted &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt;) is greater than that of the set of algebraic numbers (&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;).
*[[Bernhard Riemann]], at the end of his famous 1859 paper "[[On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude]]", stated (based on his results) that the [[logarithmic integral function|logarithmic integral]] gives a somewhat too high estimate of the [[prime-counting function]]. The evidence also seemed to indicate this. However, in 1914 [[J. E. Littlewood]] proved that this was not always the case, and in fact it is now known that the first ''x'' for which &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\pi(x)\,&gt;\,\mathrm{li}(x)&lt;/math&gt; occurs somewhere before 10&lt;sup&gt;317&lt;/sup&gt;. See [[Skewes' number]] for more detail.
*Naïvely it might be expected that a continuous function must have a derivative or else that the set of points where it is not differentiable should be "small" in some sense. This was disproved in 1872 by [[Karl Weierstrass]], using earlier found examples of functions that were continuous but nowhere differentiable (see [[Weierstrass function]]). According to Weierstrass in his paper, earlier mathematicians including [[Gauss]] had often assumed that such functions did not exist.
*It was conjectured in 1919 by [[George Pólya]], based on the evidence, that most numbers less than any particular limit have an odd number of [[prime factor]]s. However, this [[Pólya conjecture]] was disproved in 1958. It turns out that for some values of the limit (such as values a bit more than 906 million), most numbers less than the limit have an even number of prime factors.
*[[Erik Christopher Zeeman]] tried for 7 years to prove that one cannot untie a [[knot theory|knot]] on a [[n-sphere|4-sphere]]. Then one day he decided to try to prove the opposite, and he succeeded in a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/mg19526131.900-interview-why-mathematics-is-beautiful.html Why mathematics is beautiful] in [[New Scientist]], 21 July 2007, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
*A "theorem" of [[Jan-Erik Roos]] in 1961 stated that in an [AB4&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;] [[abelian category]], lim&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; vanishes on [[Mittag-Leffler]] sequences. This "theorem" was used by many people since then, but it was disproved by counterexample in 2002 by [[Amnon Neeman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/aeem2yx884nnufxn/ "A counterexample to a 1961 'theorem' in homological algebra"] by Amnon Neeman, ''Inventiones mathematicae'', 148, 2, pp. 397-420, May, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6560">A '''mask generation function''' ('''MGF''') is a cryptographic primitive similar to a [[cryptographic hash function]] except that while a hash function's output is a fixed size, a MGF supports output of a variable length. In this respect, a MGF can be viewed as a single-use [[sponge function]]: it can absorb any length of input and process it to produce any length of output. Mask generation functions are completely deterministic: for any given input and desired output length the output is always the same.

== Definition ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A mask generation function takes an octet string of variable length and a desired output length as input, and outputs an octet string of the desired length. There may be restrictions on the length of the input and output octet strings, but such bounds are generally very large. Mask generation functions are deterministic; the octet string output is completely determined by the input octet string. The output of a mask generation function should be pseudorandom, that is, if the seed to the function is unknown, it should be infeasible to distinguish the output from a truly random string.&lt;ref name="rsa"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2437.txt |title=RFC 2437 PKCS #1 |author=RSA Laboratories}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Applications ==

Mask generation functions, as generalizations of hash functions, are useful wherever hash functions are. However, use of a MGF is desirable in cases where a fixed-size hash would be inadequate.  Examples include generating [[Padding (cryptography)|padding]], producing [[One-time pad|one time pads]] or [[keystream|keystreams]] in [[Symmetric-key_algorithm|symmetric key encryption]], and yielding outputs for [[pseudorandom number generator|pseudorandom number generators]].

=== Padding schemes ===

Mask generation functions were first proposed as part of the specification for padding in the [[Optimal_asymmetric_encryption_padding|RSA-OAEP]] algorithm. The OAEP algorithm required a cryptographic hash function that could generate an output equal in size to a "data block" whose length was proportional to arbitrarily sized input message.&lt;ref name="rsa"/&gt;

=== Keyed encryption ===

The [[Salsa20]] stream cipher may be viewed as a mask generation function as its [[keystream]] is produced by hashing the key and nonce with a counter, to yield an arbitrarily long output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cr.yp.to/snuffle/salsafamily-20071225.pdf | title=The Salsa20 family of stream ciphers |author=Daniel J. Bernstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Salsa20 generates the stream in 64-byte (512-bit) blocks. Each block is an independent hash of the key, the nonce, and a 64-bit block number; there is no chaining from one block to the next. The Salsa20 output stream can therefore be accessed randomly, and any number of blocks can be computed in parallel.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Random number generators ===

NIST Special Publication 800-90A&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf | title=Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators |author=National Institute of Standards and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines a class of cryptographically secure random number generators, one of which is the "Hash DRBG", which uses a hash function with a counter to produce a requested sequence of random bits equal in size to the requested number of random bits.

== Examples ==

Perhaps the most common and straightforward mechanism to build a MGF is to iteratively apply a hash function together with an incrementing counter value. The counter may be incremented indefinitely to yield new output blocks until a sufficient amount of output is collected. This is the approach used in MGF1.

=== MGF1 ===

MGF1 is a mask generation function defined in the Public Key Cryptography Standard #1 published by RSA Laboratories&lt;ref name="rsa"/&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
====Options====
&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Hash}&lt;/math&gt;
:   hash function (&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{hLen}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the length in octets of the hash function output)

====Input====
&lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;
:seed from which mask is generated, an octet string
&lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;
:intended length in octets of the mask, at most &lt;math&gt;2^{32}(\mathsf{hLen})&lt;/math&gt;

====Output====
&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{mask}&lt;/math&gt;
:mask, an octet string of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;; or "mask too long"

====Steps====
{{Ordered list | list_style_type=decimal
|   If &lt;math&gt;l &gt; 2^{32}(\mathsf{hLen})&lt;/math&gt;, output "mask too long" and stop.
|   Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;  be the empty octet string.
|   For &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{counter}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\left\lceil{\tfrac{l}{\mathsf{hLen}}}\right\rceil-1&lt;/math&gt;, do the following:
    {{Ordered list | list_style_type=lower-alpha
    |   Convert &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{counter}&lt;/math&gt; to an octet string &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; with the primitive &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{I2OSP}&lt;/math&gt;:
:   &lt;math&gt;C = \mathsf{I2OSP} (\mathsf{counter}, 4)&lt;/math&gt;
    |   Concatenate the hash of the seed &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; to the octet string &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;:
:   &lt;math&gt;T =   T \shortparallel \mathsf{Hash} (Z \shortparallel C)&lt;/math&gt;
}}
|  Output the leading &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; octets of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; as the octet string mask.
}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Example Code ===

Below is python code implementing MGF1:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
import hashlib

def i2osp(integer, size=4):
  return ''.join([chr((integer &gt;&gt; (8 * i)) &amp; 0xFF) for i in reversed(range(size))])

def mgf1(input, length, hash=hashlib.sha1):
  counter = 0
  output = ''
  while (len(output) &lt; length):
    C = i2osp(counter, 4)
    output += hash(input + C).digest()
    counter += 1
  return output[:length]
&lt;/source&gt;

Example outputs of MGF1:

[[File:Conformalsphere.pdf|thumb|A null cone where ''n'' = 3]]
In [[mathematics]], given a [[vector space]] ''X'' with an associated quadratic form ''q'', written {{nowrap|(''X'', ''q'')}}, a '''null vector''' or '''isotropic vector''' is a non-zero element ''x'' of ''X'' for which {{nowrap|1=''q''(''x'') = 0}}.

In the theory of [[real number|real]] [[bilinear form]]s, [[definite quadratic form]]s and [[isotropic quadratic form]]s are distinct. They are distinguished in that only for the latter there exists a nonzero null vector. Where such a vector exists, {{nowrap|(''X'', ''q'')}} is called a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]].

A pseudo-Euclidean vector space may be decomposed (non-uniquely) into [[orthogonal subspaces]] ''A'' and ''B'', {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''A'' + ''B''}}, where ''q'' is positive-definite on ''A'' and negative-definite on ''B''. The '''null cone''', or '''isotropic cone''', of ''X'' consists of the union of balanced spheres:
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{r\ge0} \{x = a + b : q(a) = -q(b) = r, a \in A, b \in B \}.&lt;/math&gt;
The null cone is also the union of the [[isotropic line]]s through the origin.

==Examples==
The [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|light-like]] vectors of [[Minkowski space]] are null vectors.

The four [[linearly independent]] [[biquaternion]]s {{nowrap|1=''l'' = 1 + ''hi''}}, {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1 + ''hj''}}, {{nowrap|1=''m'' = 1 + ''hk''}}, and {{nowrap|1=''m''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 – ''hk''}} are null vectors and {{nowrap|{ ''l'', ''n'', ''m'', ''m''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; }{{void}}}} can serve as a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the subspace used to represent [[spacetime]]. Null vectors are also used in the [[Newman–Penrose formalism]] approach to spacetime manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Dolan (1968) [http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1103840725 A Singularity-free solution of the Maxwell-Einstein Equations], [[Communications in Mathematical Physics]] 9(2):161–8, especially 166, link from [[Project Euclid]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[composition algebra]] ''splits'' when it has a null vector; otherwise it is a [[division algebra]].

In the [[Verma module]] of a [[Lie algebra]] there are null vectors.

'''''Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics''''' ({{lang-de|Bemerkungen über die Grundlagen der Mathematik}}) is a  book of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s notes on the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. It has been translated from German to English by [[G.E.M. Anscombe]], edited by [[G.H. von Wright]] and [[Rush Rhees]],&lt;ref name="Ludwig Wittgenstein"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ludwig |last1=Wittgenstein |editor1-first=Georg Henrik |editor1-last=von Wright |editor2-first=Rush |editor2-last=Rhees |editor3-first=Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret |editor3-last=Anscombe |year=1983 |title=Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics |edition=2nd |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-73067-9}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published first in 1956. The text has been 
produced from passages in various sources by selection and editing. The notes have been written during the years 1937-1944 and a few passages are  incorporated in the [[Philosophical Investigations]] which were composed later. When the book appeared it received many negative reviews&lt;ref name="Mathieu Marion"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marion |first=Mathieu |title=Wittgenstein, Finitism, and the Foundations of Mathematics |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-955047-0}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly from working logicians and mathematicians, among them  [[Michael Dummett]], [[Paul Bernays]], and [[Georg Kreisel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bjps/IX.34.135 |title=Wittgenstein's Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics |year=1958 |last1=Kreisel |first1=G. |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |issue=34 |pages=135–58 |volume=IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today ''Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics'' is read mostly by philosophers sympathetic to Wittgenstein and they tend to adopt a more positive stance.&lt;ref&gt;Rodych V, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein-mathematics/ ''Wittgenstein's Philosophy of Mathematics''], [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics|Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics]] is exposed chiefly by simple examples on which further skeptical comments are made. The text offers an extended analysis of the concept of [[mathematical proof]] and an exploration of Wittgenstein's contention that philosophical considerations introduce false problems  in mathematics. Wittgenstein in the Remarks adopts an attitude of doubt in opposition to much orthodoxy in the philosophy of mathematics.

Particularly controversial in the Remarks was Wittgenstein's "notorious paragraph", which contained an unusual commentary on [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]. Multiple commentators  read Wittgenstein as misunderstanding Gödel. In 2000  [[Juliet Floyd]] and [[Hilary Putnam]] suggested that the majority of commentary misunderstands 
Wittgenstein but their interpretation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Juliet |last1=Floyd |first2=Hilary |last2=Putnam |date=November 2000 |title=A Note on Wittgenstein's 'Notorious Paragraph' about the Gödel Theorem |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=97 |issue=11 |pages=624–32 |jstor=2678455 |doi=10.2307/2678455}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has not been met with approval.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Bays' disagreement ({{cite journal |first1=Timothy |last1=Bays |date=April 2004 |title=On Floyd and Putnam on Wittgenstein on Godel |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=197–210 |jstor=3655690 |doi=10.5840/jphil2004101422}}) was further commented by Putnam and Floyd and he wrote some more as [http://epistemology.xmu.edu.cn/picture/article/16/b0/b0/f21958bf418a952cbf570a793b27/a59422cd-1e84-47ad-be52-94cc76daba30.pdf Floyd, Putnam, Bays, Steiner, Wittgenstein, Gödel, Etc.]; see also M. Plebani, [http://wab.uib.no/ojs/agora-alws/article/view/1525/1501 The Key Problems of KC], ''Papers of the 31st IWS'' (eds. A. Hieke, H. Leitgeb), 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.2003.tb00272.x |title=Misunderstanding Gödel: New Arguments about Wittgenstein and New Remarks by Wittgenstein |year=2005 |last1=Rodych |first1=Victor |journal=Dialectica |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=279–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein wrote {{quote|I imagine someone asking my advice; he says: “I have constructed a proposition (I will use ‘P’ to designate it) in Russell’s symbolism, and by means of certain definitions and transformations it can be so interpreted that it says: ‘P is not provable in Russell’s system’. Must I not say that this proposition on the one hand is true, and on the other hand unprovable? For suppose it were false; then it is true that it is provable. And that surely cannot be! And if it is proved, then it is proved that it is not provable. Thus it can only be true, but unprovable.”

Just as we can ask, “ ‘Provable’ in what system?,” so we must also ask, “ ‘True’ in what system?”  “True in Russell’s system” means, as was said, proved in Russell’s system, and “false” in Russell’s system means the opposite has been proved in Russell’s system.—Now, what does your “suppose it is false” mean? In the Russell sense it means, “suppose the opposite is been proved in Russell’s system”; if that is your assumption you will now presumably give up the interpretation that it is unprovable. And by “this interpretation” I understand the translation into this English sentence.—If you assume that the proposition is provable in Russell’s system, that means it is true in the Russell sense, and the interpretation “P is not provable” again has to be given up.  If you assume that the proposition is true in the Russell sense, the same thing follows. Further: if the proposition is supposed to be false in some other than the Russell sense, then it does not contradict this for it to be proved in Russell’s system. (What is called “losing” in chess may constitute winning in another game.)&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Wittgenstein, ''Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics,'' (Cambridge: MIT, 1956): Part I, Appendix I, $8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The debate has been running  around the so-called ''Key Claim'': If one assumes that P is provable in PM, then one should give up the “translation” of P by the English sentence “P is not provable”.

Wittgenstein does not mention the name of [[Kurt Gödel]] who was a member of the [[Vienna Circle]] during the period in which Wittgenstein's early [[ideal language philosophy]] and ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' dominated the circle's thinking; multiple writings of Gödel in his [[Nachlass]] contain his own antipathy for Wittgenstein, and belief that Wittgenstein wilfully misread the theorems.&lt;ref name="edge"&gt;{{cite web |first=Rebecca Newberger |last=Goldstein |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/goldstein05/goldstein05_index.html |title=Gödel And The Nature Of Mathematical Truth |work=Edge |date=June 8, 2005 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators, such as [[Rebecca Goldstein]], have hypothesized that Gödel developed his logical theorems in opposition to Wittgenstein.&lt;ref name="edge" /&gt;

'''Rutherford "Gus" Aris''' (September 15, 1929&amp;nbsp;– November 2, 2005) was a [[chemical engineer]], [[Control theory|control theorist]], [[Applied mathematics|applied mathematician]], and a [[Regents Professor|Regents Professor Emeritus]] of [[Chemical engineering|Chemical Engineering]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] (1958–2005).

== Early life ==
Aris was born in Bournemouth, England, to Algernon Aris and Janet (Elford). From a young age, Aris was interested in chemistry.  Aris's father owned a photo-finishing works, where he would experiment with chemicals and reactions. He attended St Martin's, a small local kindergarten and moved to St Wulfran's, a local preparatory school, now [[Queen Elizabeth's School, Wimborne Minster|Queen Elizabeth's School]]. Here, he studied Latin, a skill much used later by him and he was encouraged to continue pursuit of his interest in chemistry.  Because of his achievements, he was referred to the Reverend C.B.Canning, Headmaster of [[Canford School]], a well-known public school, close to Wimborne. On the strength of this interview, he was given a place in the newly created house that the school had provided for day-boarders.  This was in 1943, when he was 14.  His mathematics teacher, H. E. Piggott, had a particular influence on Aris due to "the liveliness, enthusiasm, and care that he brought to his teaching", which "were unparalleled in my experience".&lt;ref name="MathematicalModeling"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mathematical Modeling: A Chemical Engineer's Perspective|author=Aris, Rutherford|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piggot spent substantial time on pure and applied mathematical papers, an experience that Aris described as "extraordinary". Aris dedicated his book ''Discrete Dynamic Programming'' to Piggot 15 years later.&lt;ref name="DiscreteDynamicProgramming"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discrete dynamic programming: an introduction to the optimization of staged processes.|author=Aris, Rutherford|publisher=Blaisdell|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry experience ==

=== Imperial Chemical Industries ===

Piggot helped Aris to get a job working for [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) as a laboratory technician in the Mechanical Engineering Department of the Research Labs, at the age of 17.  While working at ICI, Aris attended the University of London part-time to work toward his [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]]. Aris described this as "an excellent way to get a degree, although perhaps not so good a way of getting an education."&lt;ref name="MathematicalModeling" /&gt;  After 2 years Aris made an attempt to earn the B.Sc. Honours Degree. He sat 12 papers (exams) covering a wide range of mathematical topics, and got a degree with [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|first-class honours]].

=== University of Edinburgh ===

In 1948, ICI sent him to [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] for two years of study at the Mathematical Institute at the [[University of Edinburgh]], which was presided over by [[Alexander Aitken]]. Aris, who was accepted for post-graduate studies but not for a Ph.D., did post-graduate work at the University under the supervision of John Cossar. During this break from ICI, Aris also registered for a University of London M.Sc. in the area of mathematical analysis.  When he sat the papers, however, he failed to get the degree.

=== ICI Billingham ===

In 1950, Aris returned to ICI and began working for C. H. Bosanquet in [[Billingham]], [[England]]. Working with Bosanquet provided Aris the opportunity to work on a large variety of problems, including catalysis, heat transfer, gas scrubbing, and centrifuge design.

Aris was then promoted to Technical Officer, where he began working on chromatography. He utilized results from a paper on dispersion written by [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|Geoffrey Taylor]],&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Dispersion of soluble matter in solvent flowing slowly through a tube|author=Taylor, G.|date=August 1953|volume=219|pages=186–203|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences|jstor=99386|doi=10.1098/rspa.1953.0139}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extended its results, ultimately writing a paper in 1955 that applied the method of moments to Taylor's approach.  He submitted the paper to the ''Proceedings of the Royal Society'', with help from Taylor (who was a Fellow of the Royal Society). Aris communicated with Taylor regarding dispersion and diffusion. In the meantime, however, he was transferred to a different division, where he began working on chemical reactor design.  Frustrated with the transfer and with the proprietary nature of his commercial work, which made publishing work very difficult, he decided to move to a university, applying for several lectureship positions during 1954 and 1955 without success.  Aris continued to work at ICI, focusing much of his efforts on mathematical modeling of adiabatic multi-bed reactors, a topic that was the central focus of an [[M.S.]] student at the [[University of Minnesota]]. In 1955, [[Neal Amundson]] of the University of Minnesota, who was on sabbatical at Cambridge, visited the ICI Research Department, where Aris was working. Amundson suggested to ICI, during his visit, that Aris be sent to the University of Minnesota in [[Minneapolis]] for a year of study.  Several months later, Aris later met Amundson at Cambridge and told Amundson of his plans to leave ICI for academia, plans that he had not revealed to his superiors at ICI. Amundson offered Aris a research fellowship at the University of Minnesota, which Aris accepted.  After notifying ICI of his intent to leave, he moved to Minneapolis, [[Minnesota]] at the end of 1955.

== Academic career ==

=== University of Minnesota research fellowship ===

Aris began working on chemically reacting laminar flow, applying [[Confluent hypergeometric function|Kummer's hypergeometric function]] to the problem, and control of a stirred tank reactor with some unusual properties.  Both problems required the use of a computer to perform calculations, and Amundson provided Aris with a computer science graduate student with whom to work. Aris's research fellowship was extended for a second year, but shortly afterward, in October 1956, Aris was informed of a lectureship opening at the University of Edinburgh. He took advantage of the opportunity, and left immediately for Edinburgh.

=== University of Edinburgh lectureship ===

Aris was on the faculty of the [[University of Edinburgh]] for two years, 1956–1958. While at Edinburgh, Aris wrote papers on his work at the University of Minnesota and at ICI. Having the lectureship position allowed Aris to gain experience lecturing to students. He also attended the lectures of, and interacted with, the chair of chemical technology at the University of Edinburgh, [[Kenneth Denbigh]], who was a well-known thermodynamicist and an editor of the journal ''[[Chemical Engineering Science]]''.

=== University of Minnesota faculty ===

Aris returned to Minneapolis in the summer of 1957 to continue his work on the stirred tank reactor problem. In August he became engaged to Claire Holman, and when he informed Amundson, Amundson offered him a faculty position at the University. Aris accepted the job, and began working as an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota in 1958.

Aris had not formally received a Ph.D., but had registered three years earlier with the University of London, where he had earned his B.Sc., and which offered Ph.D. degrees by correspondence. A Ph.D. degree could be earned without following a strict preparation process; the individual needed to propose a research program after 3 years, select a committee of examiners, and submit a dissertation, and after an oral examination by and approval from the committee, the degree would be granted.  Amundson had suggested Aris look into [[Richard Bellman]]'s method of dynamic programming&lt;ref name="Bellman"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dynamic Programming|author=Bellman, R.|year=1957|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his dissertation. Amundson informally served as Aris's advisor, and Aris completed his dissertation on the topic in 1960.

His dissertation was published by the Academic Press in a series of which Bellman was the editor, and Bellman took note of the dissertation. Aris and Amundson visited Bellman at the [[Rand Corporation]], where Bellman was working on economic models. The dynamic programming method had originally been developed for economics, but Bellman was attracted by applications in engineering, and the meeting led to a joint collaboration and a publication.

Aris's research at the University of Minnesota focused on optimization, dynamic programming, control theory, Taylor diffusion, and computing engines. Aris also taught a graduate fluid mechanics course, and eventually wrote the book ''Vectors, tensors, and the basic equations of fluid mechanics''&lt;ref name="Vectors"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vectors, tensors, and the basic equations of fluid mechanics|author=Aris, Rutherford|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to make the rational mechanics approach of Truesdell, Coleman, and others more accessible to students.

=== First Cambridge sabbatical ===

After he had been with the department for six years, Aris took a sabbatical at the Shell Department of Chemical Engineering at the [[University of Cambridge]] during the 1964–1965 academic year, where he was able to interact with many well-known engineers and mathematicians such as Geoffrey Taylor and [[John Edensor Littlewood|John Littlewood]]. He also lectured in many places in Europe, including [[Brussels]], [[Copenhagen]], and [[Trondheim]].

=== Second Cambridge sabbatical ===

Aris took a second sabbatical after 6 years, again going to the [[University of Cambridge]], during the 1971–1972 academic year. He spent his time writing a monograph on mathematical models for porous catalysts, which he did not finish until 1973. During his sabbatical, he received financial support in the form of a Guggenheim grant. This also provided Aris an opportunity to participate in the board overseeing the formation and development of [[Los Alamos National Lab]]'s [[Center for Nonlinear Studies]], which allowed Aris the opportunity to travel to Los Alamos during the 1970s and 1980s.

=== Department chairmanship ===

In 1974, Neal Amundson, who had been the department chairman of the University of Minnesota's Chemical Engineering department for nearly 25 years, resigned from this position. Aris was appointed acting head of the department, while Amundson left Minnesota for the University of Houston. Aris acted as department chair for 4 years, and was relieved of the position in 1978. Coinciding with this was an offer from [[Princeton University]] to join the faculty there, as well as the offer to stay at the University of Minnesota and work half-time in the chemical engineering department and half-time in the [[paleography]] department. Aris decided to stay at the University of Minnesota.

=== Paleography ===

In addition to his interest in chemical engineering, Aris was also interested in the [[humanities]]. At the University of Minnesota, Aris was able to pursue his interest in [[paleography]] when he was granted a professorship in the [[Classics]] Department, where he taught classes and published books and research articles. Aris published his book ''Explicatio Formarum Literarum'', or ''The Unfolding of Letterforms'', which covered the history of written letters from the 1st century to the [[15th century in literature|15th century]].

=== Further sabbaticals ===

Aris had several other sabbaticals over his 40-year career.  Through the Fairchild Distinguished Scholar program at the [[California Institute of Technology]], Aris was able to spend a portion of 1977 and a year in 1980–1981 on sabbatical in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]]. He dedicated a portion of his time to paleography, utilizing the nearby [[Huntington Library]]. Additionally, through a personal connection at the [[University of Leeds]], Aris was able to spend several weeks there as Brotherton Professor in 1985. Aris spent his last sabbatical, from 1993–1994, at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] at Princeton.

== Death ==

Aris penned many [[poetry|poems]] and [[anecdote]]s, many relating his difficulties with [[Parkinson's disease]], from which Aris eventually died. Aris died on November 2, 2005, in [[Edina, Minnesota|Edina]], [[Minnesota]].

== Legacy ==

Over the course of his long academic career, Aris was a visiting professor at many institutions, including [[Cambridge University]], the [[California Institute of Technology]], and [[Princeton University]]; he authored 13 books and more than 300 chemical engineering research articles, and mentored 48 Ph.D. and 20 M.S. graduate students. Aris was well known for his research on mathematical modeling, [[chemical reactor]] and [[chemical process]] design, and [[distillation]] techniques, as well as his paleographic research.

After he had been department head for four years, in 1978 he was named [[Professors in the United States#Distinguished .28teaching .2F research.29 professor|Regents Professor]]. Some of the awards and honors earned by Aris include a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], election to the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 1975 and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aris was also a member of the [[American Chemical Society]], the [[Society for Mathematical Biology]], and the [[Society of Scribes and Illuminators]], among others. Aris was awarded the [[Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award]] in 1992 for his contributions to the field of [[control theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a2c2.org/awards/richard-e-bellman-control-heritage-award |title=Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award |publisher=[[American Automatic Control Council]] |accessdate=2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the Neal R. Amundson Award for Excellence in Chemical Reaction Engineering by the International Symposia on Chemical Reaction Engineering in 1998.&lt;ref name="ISCRE"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iscre.org/amundsonaward.html|title=Amundson Award|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the board of the ISCRE (International Symposia on Chemical Reaction Engineering) established the '''Rutherford Aris Young Investigator Award for Excellence in Chemical Reaction Engineering'''.  This award honors young researchers under the age of 40 to recognize outstanding contributions in experimental and/or theoretical reaction engineering research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iscre.org/ISCRE24/aris.shtml|title=ISCRE 24 Aris Award|website=iscre.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''setoid''' (''X'', ~) is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] (or [[type (mathematics)|type]]) ''X'' equipped with an [[equivalence relation]] ~.  A Setoid may also be called '''E-set''', '''[[Errett Bishop|Bishop]] set''', or '''extensional set'''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Buisse, Peter Dybjer, [http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1571066108003976/1-s2.0-S1571066108003976-main.pdf?_tid=2f6e8f24-5e62-11e7-8bda-00000aacb35e&amp;acdnat=1498916325_9ee52b78dcb800a72e25dac0be00d6ac "The Interpretation of Intuitionistic Type Theory in Locally Cartesian Closed Categories - an Intuitionistic Perspective"], ''Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science'' 218 (2008) 21–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Setoids are studied especially in [[proof theory]] and in [[type-theoretic]] [[foundations of mathematics]]. Often in mathematics, when one defines an equivalence relation on a set, one immediately forms the [[quotient set]] (turning equivalence into [[equality (mathematics)|equality]]). In contrast, setoids may be used when a difference between identity and equivalence must be maintained, often with an interpretation of [[intension]]al equality (the equality on the original set) and [[Extension (semantics)|extensional]] equality (the equivalence relation, or the equality on the quotient set).

==Proof theory==
In proof theory, particularly the proof theory of [[constructive mathematics]] based on the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]], one often identifies a mathematical [[Proposition (mathematics)|proposition]] with its set of [[proof (mathematics)|proof]]s (if any). A given proposition may have many proofs, of course; according to the principle of [[proof irrelevance]], normally only the truth of the proposition matters, not which proof was used. However, the Curry–Howard correspondence can turn proofs into [[algorithm]]s, and differences between algorithms are often important. So proof theorists may prefer to identify a proposition with a ''setoid'' of proofs, considering proofs equivalent if they can be converted into one another through [[beta conversion]] or the like.

==Type theory==
In type-theoretic foundations of mathematics, setoids may be used in a type theory that lacks [[quotient type]]s to model general mathematical sets. For example, in [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s [[intuitionistic type theory]], there is no type of [[real number]]s, only a type of [[regular Cauchy sequence]]s of [[rational number]]s. To do [[real analysis]] in Martin-Löf's framework, therefore, one must work with a ''setoid'' of real numbers, the type of regular Cauchy sequences equipped with the usual notion of equivalence.  Predicates and functions of real numbers need to be defined for regular Cauchy sequences and proven to be compatible with the equivalence relation.  Typically (although it depends on the type theory used), the [[axiom of choice]] will hold for functions between types (intensional functions), but not for functions between setoids (extensional functions).{{clarify|date=October 2010}} The term "set" is variously used either as a synonym of "type" or as a synonym of "setoid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=9|url=http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/Logic/TypesSS05/Extra/palmgren.pdf|title=Bishop's set theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructive mathematics==
In [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]], one often takes a setoid with an [[apartness relation]] instead of an equivalence relation, called a '''constructive''' setoid. One sometimes also considers a '''partial''' setoid using a [[partial equivalence relation]] or partial apartness. (see e.g. Barthe ''et al.'', section 1)

In [[digital communications]] '''shaping codes''' are a method of [[encoding]] that changes the distribution of signals to improve efficiency.

==Description==
Typical   digital [[communication systems]] uses M-[[Quadrature Amplitude Modulation]]([[QAM]]) to communicate through an analog channel (specifically a [[Channel (communications)|channel]] with [[Gaussian noise]]). For Higher bit rates(M) the minimum [[Signal to Noise ratio]] (SNR) required by a QAM system with [[Error detection and correction#Error-correcting code|Error Correcting Codes]] is about 1.53 [[Decibel|dB]]  higher  than minimum SNR required by a Gaussian source(&gt;30% more transmitter power) as given in   [[Shannon–Hartley theorem]]
:&lt;math&gt; C =  B \log_2 \left( 1+\frac{S}{N} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where
:''C'' is the [[channel capacity]] in [[bits per second]];
:''B'' is the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the channel in [[hertz]];
: ''S'' is the total signal power over the bandwidth and
: ''N'' is the total noise power over the bandwidth.
:''S/N'' is the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] of the communication signal to the Gaussian noise interference expressed as a straight power ratio (not as [[decibels]]).

This 1.53 dB  difference is called the ''shaping gap''.  Typically digital system will encode bits with uniform probability to maximize the [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].   Shaping code act as buffer between digital sources and modulator communication system. They will receive uniformly distributed data and convert it to Gaussian like distribution before presenting to the modulator. Shaping codes are helpful in reducing transmit power and thus reduce the cost of Power amplifier and the interference caused to other users in the vicinity.

==Application==

Some of the methods used for shaping are described in the trellis shaping paper by Dr. [[Dave Forney|G. D. Forney Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=119687&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shell mapping]]&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=jtputBwrGvcC&amp;pg=PA258&amp;lpg=PA258&amp;dq=shell+mapping&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8tO8iNxr4i&amp;sig=xaOuhKAMMweHYPPHnZuzKZmHYjc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oVugTIbZIoe0cMjjpeEJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=shell%20mapping&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; is  used  in [[V.34 (recommendation)|V.34]] modems  to get a shaping gain of .8 [[Decibel|dB]].
All the shaping schemes in the literature try to reduce the transmitted signal power. In future this may have find application in [[wireless network]]s where the interference from other nodes are becoming the major issue.

The '''Sloan Research Fellowships''' are awarded annually by the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] since 1955 to "provide support and recognition to early-career scientists and scholars".

Fellowships were initially awarded in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[mathematics]]. Awards were later added in [[neuroscience]] (1972), [[economics]] (1980), [[computer science]] (1993), and computational and evolutionary [[molecular biology]] (2002).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = History|url = http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/history/|website = www.sloan.org|access-date = 2016-01-22|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120908235159/http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/history/|archivedate = 2012-09-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These two-year fellowships are awarded to 126 researchers yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sloan Research Fellowships|url = http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/|website = www.sloan.org|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Eligibility requirements ==

The foundation has been supportive of scientists who are parents by allowing them extra time after their doctorate during which they remain eligible for the award:&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Candidates for Sloan Research Fellowships are required to hold the Ph.D. (or equivalent) in chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science, economics, neuroscience or computational and evolutionary molecular biology, or in a related interdisciplinary field, and must be members of the regular faculty (i.e., tenure track) of a college or university in the United States or Canada. They may be no more than six years from completion of the most recent Ph.D. or equivalent as of the year of their nomination, unless special circumstances such as military service, a change of field, or child rearing are involved or unless they have held a faculty appointment for less than two years. If any of the above circumstances apply, the letter of nomination (see below) should provide a clear explanation. While Fellows are expected to be at an early stage of their research careers, there should be strong evidence of independent research accomplishments. Candidates in all fields are normally below the rank of associate professor and do not hold tenure, but these are not strict requirements. The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation welcomes nominations of all candidates who meet the traditional high standards of the program, and strongly encourages the participation of women and members of underrepresented minority groups."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Award recipients ==
Since the beginning of the program in 1955, 43 fellows have won a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] Prize,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nobel Laureates|url = http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/nobel-laureates/|website = www.sloan.org|access-date = 2016-01-22|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160127182945/http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/nobel-laureates/|archivedate = 2016-01-27|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 16 have won the [[Fields Medal]] in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fields Medalists|url = http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/fields-medalists/|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120908235152/http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/fields-medalists/|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2012-09-08|website = www.sloan.org|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5308">In [[functional analysis]], a '''state''' of an [[operator system]] is a [[positive linear functional]] of [[operator norm|norm]] 1. States in functional analysis [[generalization|generalize]] the notion of [[density matrix|density matrices]] in quantum mechanics, which represent [[quantum state]]s, both {{section link|quantum state|Mixed states|Pure states|nopage=y}}. Density matrices in turn generalize [[quantum state|state vectors]], which only represent pure states.  For ''M'' an operator system in a [[C*-algebra]] ''A'' with identity, the set of all states of'' ''M, sometimes denoted by S(''M''),  is convex, weak-* closed in the Banach dual space ''M''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus the set of all states of ''M'' with the weak-* topology forms a compact Hausdorff space, known as the '''state space of ''M'' '''.

In the C*-algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics, states in this previous sense correspond to physical states, i.e. mappings from physical observables (self-adjoint elements of the C*-algebra) to their expected measurement outcome (real number).

== Jordan decomposition ==

States can be viewed as noncommutative generalizations of [[probability measure]]s. By [[Gelfand representation]], every commutative C*-algebra ''A'' is of the form ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') for some locally compact Hausdorff ''X''. In this case, ''S''(''A'') consists of positive [[Radon measure]]s on ''X'', and the {{section link||pure states}} are the evaluation functionals on ''X''.

More generally, the [[GNS construction]] shows that every state is, after choosing a suitable representation, a [[State (functional analysis)#Vector states|vector state]].

A bounded linear functional on a C*-algebra ''A'' is said to be '''self-adjoint''' if it is real-valued on the self-adjoint elements of ''A''. Self-adjoint functionals are noncommutative analogues of [[signed measure]]s.

The [[Hahn decomposition theorem|Jordan decomposition]] in measure theory says that every signed measure can be expressed as the difference of two positive measures supported on disjoint sets. This can be extended to the noncommutative setting.

:'''Theorem''' Every self-adjoint ''f'' in ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; can be written as ''f'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt; where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt; are positive functionals and ||''f''|| = ||''f''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;|| + ||''f''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;||.

A proof can be sketched as follows: Let Ω be the weak*-compact set of positive linear functionals on ''A'' with norm ≤ 1, and ''C''(Ω) be the continuous functions on Ω. ''A'' can be viewed as a closed linear subspace of ''C''(Ω) (this is ''[[Richard V. Kadison|Kadison]]'s function representation''). By Hahn–Banach, ''f'' extends to a ''g'' in ''C''(Ω)* with ||g|| = ||f||.

Using results from measure theory quoted above, one has

:&lt;math&gt;g(\cdot) = \int \cdot \; d \mu&lt;/math&gt;

where, by the self-adjointness of ''f'', ''μ'' can be taken to be a signed measure. Write

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \mu_+ - \mu_-, \;&lt;/math&gt;

a difference of positive measures. The restrictions of the functionals ∫ · d''μ''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;  and ∫ · d''μ''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt; to ''A'' has the required properties of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;. This proves the theorem.

It follows from the above decomposition that ''A*'' is the linear span of states.

==Some important classes of states==

===Pure states===
By the [[Krein-Milman theorem]], the state space of ''M'' has extreme points{{clarify|date=September 2018}}. The extreme points of the state space are termed '''pure states''' and other states are known as '''mixed states'''.

===Vector states===
For a Hilbert space ''H'' and a vector ''x'' in ''H'', the equation &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') := ⟨''Ax'',''x''⟩ (for ''A'' in ''B(H)'' ), defines a positive linear functional on ''B(H)''. Since &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''1'')=||''x''||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is a state if ||''x''||=1. If ''A'' is a C*-subalgebra of ''B(H)'' and ''M'' an operator system in ''A'', then the restriction of &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''M'' defines a positive linear functional on ''M''. The states of ''M'' that arise in this manner, from unit vectors in ''H'', are termed '''vector states''' of ''M''.

===Normal states===
A state &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is called '''normal''', iff for every monotone, increasing [[net (mathematics)|net]] &lt;math&gt;H_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of operators with upper bound &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\tau(H_\alpha)\;&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;\tau(H)\;&lt;/math&gt;.

===Tracial states===
A '''tracial state''' is a state &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\tau(AB)=\tau (BA)\;.&lt;/math&gt;

For any separable C*-algebra, the set of tracial states is a [[Choquet theory|Choquet simplex]].

===Factorial states===
A '''factorial state''' of a C*-algebra ''A'' is a state such that the commutant of the corresponding GNS representation of ''A'' is a [[Von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]].

{{General geometry |expanded=3d}}
'''Three-dimensional space''' (also: '''3-space''' or, rarely, '''tri-dimensional space''') is a geometric setting in which three values (called [[parameter]]s) are required to determine the position of an element (i.e., [[Point (mathematics)|point]]). This is the informal meaning of the term [[dimension]].

In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], a [[Euclidean vector|sequence]] of {{math|''n''}} [[Real number|numbers]] can be understood as a location in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional space. When {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}, the set of all such locations is called {{anchor|3D EUCLIDEAN SPACE}}'''three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]'''. It is commonly represented by the symbol {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This serves as a three-parameter model of the physical [[universe]] (that is, the spatial part, without considering time) in which all known [[matter]] exists. However, this space is only one example of a large variety of spaces in three dimensions called [[3-manifold]]s. In this classical example, when the three values refer to measurements in different directions ([[Coordinate system|coordinates]]), any three directions can be chosen, provided that [[Vector space|vectors]] in these directions do not all lie in the same [[Two-dimensional space|2-space]] ([[plane (geometry)|plane]]). Furthermore, in this case, these three values can be labeled by any combination of three chosen from the terms ''[[width]]'', ''[[height]]'', ''[[Elevation|depth]]'', and [[length|''length'']].

==In euclidean geometry==

===Coordinate systems===
{{main|Coordinate system}}
In mathematics, [[analytic geometry]] (also called Cartesian geometry) describes every point in three-dimensional space by means of three coordinates. Three [[coordinate axis|coordinate axes]] are given, each perpendicular to the other two at the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]], the point at which they cross.  They are usually labeled {{math|''x'', ''y''}}, and {{math|''z''}}. Relative to these axes, the position of any point in three-dimensional space is given by an ordered triple of [[real number]]s, each number giving the distance of that point from the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] measured along the given axis, which is equal to the distance of that point from the plane determined by the other two axes.&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes-Hallett|first1=Deborah|last2=McCallum|first2=William G.|last3=Gleason|first3=Andrew M.|title=Calculus : Single and Multivariable|date=2013|publisher=John wiley|isbn=978-0470-88861-2|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other popular methods of describing the location of a point in three-dimensional space include [[cylindrical coordinates]] and [[spherical coordinates]], though there are an infinite number of possible methods. See [[Euclidean space]].

Below are images of the above-mentioned systems.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Lines and planes===

Two distinct points always determine a (straight) [[Line (geometry)|line]]. Three distinct points are either [[collinear]] or determine a unique plane. Four distinct points can either be collinear, [[coplanar]] or determine the entire space.

Two distinct lines can either intersect, be [[Parallel line|parallel]] or be [[Skew lines|skew]]. Two parallel lines, or [[two intersecting lines]], lie in a unique plane, so skew lines are lines that do not meet and do not lie in a common plane.

Two distinct planes can either meet in a common line or are parallel (do not meet). Three distinct planes, no pair of which are parallel, can either meet in a common line, meet in a unique common point or have no point in common. In the last case, the three lines of intersection of each pair of planes are mutually parallel.

A line can lie in a given plane, intersect that plane in a unique point or be parallel to the plane. In the last case, there will be lines in the plane that are parallel to the given line.

A [[hyperplane]] is a subspace of one dimension less than the dimension of the full space. The hyperplanes of a three-dimensional space are the two-dimensional subspaces, that is, the planes. In terms of cartesian coordinates, the points of a hyperplane satisfy a single [[linear equation]], so planes in this 3-space are described by linear equations. A line can be described by a pair of independent linear equations, each representing a plane having this line as a common intersection.

[[Varignon's theorem]] states that the midpoints of any quadrilateral in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; form a [[parallelogram]], and so, are coplanar.

===Spheres and balls===
{{main|Sphere}}
[[File:Sphere wireframe 10deg 6r.svg|right|thumb|A [[3D projection#Perspective projection|perspective projection]] of a sphere onto two dimensions]]
A [[sphere]] in 3-space (also called a '''2-sphere''' because it is a 2-dimensional object) consists of the set of all points in 3-space at a fixed distance {{math|''r''}} from a central point {{mvar|P}}. The solid enclosed by the sphere is called a [[Ball (mathematics)|'''ball''']] (or, more precisely a '''3-ball'''). The volume of the ball is given by

:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another type of sphere arises from a 4-ball, whose three-dimensional surface is the '''3-sphere''': points equidistant to the origin of the euclidean space {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}. If a point has coordinates, {{math|''P''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''w'')}}, then {{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''w''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}} characterizes those points on the unit 3-sphere centered at the origin.

===Polytopes===
{{main|Polyhedron}}
In three dimensions, there are nine regular polytopes: the five convex [[Platonic solid]]s and the four nonconvex [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]].

===Surfaces of revolution===
{{main|Surface of revolution}}
A [[Surface (topology)|surface]] generated by revolving a plane [[curve]] about a fixed line in its plane as an axis is called a [[surface of revolution]]. The plane curve is called the ''generatrix'' of the surface. A section of the surface, made by intersecting the surface with a plane that is perpendicular (orthogonal) to the axis, is a circle.

Simple examples occur when the generatrix is a line. If the generatrix line intersects the axis line, the surface of revolution is a right circular [[Cone (mathematics)|cone]] with vertex (apex) the point of intersection. However, if the generatrix and axis are parallel, the surface of revolution is a circular [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]].

===Quadric surfaces===
{{main|Quadric surface}}
In analogy with the [[conic section]]s, the set of points whose cartesian coordinates satisfy the general equation of the second degree, namely,
:&lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + Fxy + Gyz + Hxz + Jx + Ky + Lz + M = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''F'', ''G'', ''H'', ''J'', ''K'', ''L''}} and {{math|''M''}} are real numbers and not all of {{math|''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''F'', ''G''}} and {{math|''H''}} are zero is called a '''quadric surface'''.&lt;ref name=Brannan&gt;{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|pages=34–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six types of [[degeneracy (mathematics)|non-degenerate]] quadric surfaces:
# [[Ellipsoid]]
# [[Hyperboloid of one sheet]]
# [[Hyperboloid of two sheets]]
# [[Elliptic cone]]
# [[Elliptic paraboloid]]
# [[Hyperbolic paraboloid]]

The degenerate quadric surfaces are the empty set, a single point, a single line, a single plane, a pair of planes or a quadratic cylinder (a surface consisting of a non-degenerate conic section in a plane {{pi}} and all the lines of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} through that conic that are normal to {{pi}}).&lt;ref name=Brannan /&gt; Elliptic cones are sometimes considered to be degenerate quadric surfaces as well.

Both the hyperboloid of one sheet and the hyperbolic paraboloid are [[ruled surface]]s, meaning that they can be made up from a family of straight lines. In fact, each has two families of generating lines, the members of each family are disjoint and each member one family intersects, with just one exception, every member of the other family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|pages=41–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each family is called a [[regulus (geometry)|regulus]].

==In linear algebra==
Another way of viewing three-dimensional space is found in [[linear algebra]], where the idea of independence is crucial. Space has three dimensions because the length of a [[cuboid|box]] is independent of its width or breadth. In the technical language of linear algebra, space is three-dimensional because every point in space can be described by a linear combination of three independent [[coordinate vector|vector]]s.

===Dot product, angle, and length===
{{main|Dot product}}
A vector can be pictured as an arrow. The vector's magnitude is its length, and its direction is the direction the arrow points. A vector in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be represented by an ordered triple of real numbers. These numbers are called the '''components''' of the vector.

The dot product of two vectors {{math|1='''A''' = [''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} and {{math|1='''B''' = [''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anton|1994|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{B} = A_1B_1 + A_2B_2 + A_3B_3.&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude of a vector {{math|'''A'''}} is denoted by {{math|{{!}}{{!}}'''A'''{{!}}{{!}}}}. The dot product of a vector {{math|1='''A''' = [''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} with itself is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A\cdot\mathbf A = \|\mathbf A\|^2 = A_1^2 + A_2^2 + A_3^2,&lt;/math&gt;
which gives
: &lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf A\| = \sqrt{\mathbf A\cdot\mathbf A} = \sqrt{A_1^2 + A_2^2 + A_3^2},&lt;/math&gt;
the formula for the [[Euclidean length]] of the vector.

Without reference to the components of the vectors, the dot product of two non-zero Euclidean vectors {{math|'''A'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anton|1994|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A\cdot\mathbf B = \|\mathbf A\|\,\|\mathbf B\|\cos\theta,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''θ''}} is the [[angle]] between {{math|'''A'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}.

===Cross product===
{{main|Cross product}}
The [[cross product]] or '''vector product''' is a [[binary operation]] on two [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space|space]] and is denoted by the symbol  ×. The cross product '''a''' × '''b''' of the vectors '''a''' and '''b''' is a vector that is [[perpendicular]] to both and therefore [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the plane containing them. It has many applications in mathematics, [[physics]], and [[engineering]].

The space and product form an [[algebra over a field]], which is neither [[commutative]] nor [[associative]], but is a [[Lie algebra]] with the cross product being the Lie bracket.

One can in ''n'' dimensions take the product of {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}} vectors to produce a vector perpendicular to all of them. But if the product is limited to non-trivial binary products with vector results, it exists only in three and [[Seven-dimensional cross product|seven dimensions]].&lt;ref name=Massey2&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cross products of vectors in higher dimensional Euclidean spaces |author=WS Massey |year=1983 |jstor=2323537|quote=If one requires only three basic properties of the cross product ... it turns out that a cross product of vectors exists only in 3-dimensional and 7-dimensional Euclidean space. |pages=697–701 |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=90 |issue=10 |ref=harv |doi=10.2307/2323537}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cross product vector.svg|thumb|right|The cross-product in respect to a right-handed coordinate system]]

==In calculus==
{{main|vector calculus}}

===Gradient, divergence and curl===
In a rectangular coordinate system, the gradient is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \mathbf{i} +
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}  \mathbf{j} +
\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;

The divergence of a [[continuously differentiable]] [[vector field]] '''F''' = ''U'' '''i''' + ''V'' '''j''' + ''W'' '''k''' is equal to the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]-valued function:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div}\,\mathbf{F} = \nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}
=\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}
+\frac{\partial V}{\partial y}
+\frac{\partial W}{\partial z
}. &lt;/math&gt;

Expanded in [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] (see [[Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates]] for [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical]] and [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical]] coordinate representations), the curl ∇ × '''F''' is, for '''F''' composed of [''F''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} &amp; \mathbf{j} &amp; \mathbf{k} \\  \\
{\frac{\partial}{\partial x}} &amp; {\frac{\partial}{\partial y}} &amp; {\frac{\partial}{\partial z}} \\
 \\  F_x &amp; F_y &amp; F_z \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''i''', '''j''', and '''k''' are the [[unit vector]]s for the ''x''-, ''y''-, and ''z''-axes, respectively. This expands as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Arfken, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y}  - \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z}\right) \mathbf{i} + \left(\frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x}\right) \mathbf{j} + \left(\frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y}\right) \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;

===Line integrals, surface integrals, and volume integrals===
For some [[scalar field]] ''f'' : ''U'' ⊆ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R''', the line integral along a [[piecewise smooth]] [[curve]] ''C'' ⊂  ''U'' is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_C f\, ds = \int_a^b f(\mathbf{r}(t)) |\mathbf{r}'(t)|\, dt.&lt;/math&gt;
where '''r''': [a, b] → ''C'' is an arbitrary [[bijective]] [[parametric equation|parametrization]] of the curve ''C'' such that '''r'''(''a'') and '''r'''(''b'') give the endpoints of ''C'' and &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;.

For a [[vector field]] '''F''' : ''U'' ⊆ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the line integral along a [[piecewise smooth]] [[curve]] ''C'' ⊂ ''U'', in the direction of '''r''', is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_C \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})\cdot\,d\mathbf{r} = \int_a^b \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t))\cdot\mathbf{r}'(t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

where · is the [[dot product]] and '''r''': [a, b] → ''C'' is a [[bijective]] [[parametric equation|parametrization]] of the curve ''C'' such that '''r'''(''a'') and '''r'''(''b'') give the endpoints of ''C''.

A [[surface integral]]  is a generalization of [[multiple integral]]s to integration over [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s. It can be thought of as the [[double integral]] analog of the [[line integral]]. To find an explicit formula for the surface integral, we need to [[Coordinate system|parameterize]] the surface of interest, ''S'', by considering a system of [[curvilinear coordinates]] on ''S'', like the [[Geographic coordinate system|latitude and longitude]] on a [[sphere]]. Let such a parameterization be '''x'''(''s'', ''t''), where (''s'', ''t'') varies in some region ''T'' in the [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in two dimensions|plane]]. Then, the surface integral is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\iint_{S} f \,\mathrm dS
= \iint_{T} f(\mathbf{x}(s, t)) \left\|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial s}\times {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right\| \mathrm ds\, \mathrm dt
&lt;/math&gt;
where the expression between bars on the right-hand side is the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the [[cross product]] of the [[partial derivative]]s of '''x'''(''s'', ''t''), and is known as the surface [[volume element|element]]. Given a vector field '''v''' on ''S'', that is a function that assigns to each '''x''' in ''S'' a vector '''v'''('''x'''), the surface integral can be defined component-wise according to the definition of the surface integral of a scalar field; the result is a vector.

A [[volume integral]] refers to an [[integral]] over a  3-[[dimension]]al domain.

It can also mean a [[multiple integral|triple integral]] within a region ''D'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z),&lt;/math&gt; and is usually written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint\limits_D f(x,y,z)\,dx\,dy\,dz.&lt;/math&gt;

===Fundamental theorem of line integrals===
{{main|Fundamental theorem of line integrals}}
The [[fundamental theorem of line integrals]], says that a [[line integral]] through a [[gradient]] field can be evaluated by evaluating the original scalar field at the endpoints of the curve.

Let &lt;math&gt; \varphi : U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt; \varphi\left(\mathbf{q}\right)-\varphi\left(\mathbf{p}\right) = \int_{\gamma[\mathbf{p},\,\mathbf{q}]} \nabla\varphi(\mathbf{r})\cdot d\mathbf{r}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Stokes' theorem===
{{main|Stokes' theorem}}
[[Stokes' theorem]] relates the [[surface integral]] of the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a [[vector field]] F over a surface Σ in Euclidean three-space to the [[line integral]] of the vector field over its boundary ∂Σ:

:&lt;math&gt; \iint_{\Sigma} \nabla \times \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma} = \oint_{\partial\Sigma} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Divergence theorem===
{{main|Divergence theorem}}
Suppose {{mvar|V}} is a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (in the case of {{math|''n'' {{=}} 3, ''V''}} represents a volume in 3D space) which is [[compact space|compact]] and has a [[piecewise]] [[smooth surface|smooth boundary]] {{mvar|S}} (also indicated with {{math|∂''V'' {{=}} ''S''&amp;thinsp;}}). If {{math|'''F'''}} is a continuously differentiable vector field defined on a neighborhood of {{mvar|V}}, then the [[divergence theorem]] says:&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite book |author1=M. R. Spiegel |author2=S. Lipschutz |author3=D. Spellman | title = Vector Analysis | edition = 2nd | series = Schaum’s Outlines | publisher = McGraw Hill | location = USA | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-07-161545-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\iiint_V\left(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{F}\right)\,dV=&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{n})\,dS .&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The left side is a [[volume integral]] over the volume {{mvar|V}}, the right side is the [[surface integral]] over the boundary of the volume {{mvar|V}}. The closed manifold {{math|∂''V''}} is quite generally the boundary of {{mvar|V}} oriented by outward-pointing [[Surface normal|normals]], and {{math|'''n'''}} is the outward pointing unit normal field of the boundary {{math|∂''V''}}. ({{math|''d'''''S'''}} may be used as a shorthand for {{math|'''n'''''dS''}}.)

==In topology==
Three-dimensional space has a number of topological properties that distinguish it from spaces of other dimension numbers. For example, at least three dimensions are required to tie a [[knot theory|knot]] in a piece of string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Dale |last1=Rolfsen |title=Knots and Links |publisher=Publish or Perish |location=Berkeley, California |year=1976 |isbn=0-914098-16-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathbb{R}}^3&lt;/math&gt;, the topologists locally model all other [[3-manifold]]s.

[[File:Tree decomposition.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|A graph with eight vertices, and a tree decomposition of it onto a tree with six nodes. Each graph edge connects two vertices that are listed together at some tree node, and each graph vertex is listed at the nodes of a contiguous subtree of the tree. Each tree node lists at most three vertices, so the width of this decomposition is two.]]
In [[graph theory]], a '''tree decomposition''' is a mapping of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] into a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] that can be used to define the [[treewidth]] of the graph and speed up solving certain computational problems on the graph.

In [[machine learning]], tree decompositions are also called '''junction trees''', '''clique trees''', or '''join trees'''; they play an important role in problems like [[belief propagation|probabilistic inference]], [[constraint satisfaction]], [[query optimization]],{{citation needed|reason=It is not apparent from the linked Wikipedia article how tree decompositions are used there. Further neither this nor the linked Wikipedia article references any scientific paper on the subject. It is impossible for someone not knowledgeable in that domain to verify this. |date=June 2016}} and [[matrix decomposition]].

The concept of tree decompositions was originally introduced by {{harvs|last=Halin|first=Rudolf|authorlink=Rudolf Halin|year=1976|txt}}. Later it was rediscovered by {{harvs|first1=Neil|last1=Robertson|author1-link=Neil Robertson (mathematician)|first2=Paul|last2=Seymour|author2-link=Paul Seymour (mathematician)|year=1984|txt}} and has since been studied by many other authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Diestel|2005}} pp.354–355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Intuitively, a tree decomposition represents the vertices of a given graph ''G'' as subtrees of a tree, in such a way that vertices in the given graph are adjacent only when the corresponding subtrees intersect. Thus, ''G'' forms a [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] of the [[intersection graph]] of the subtrees. The full intersection graph is a [[chordal graph]].

Each subtree associates a graph vertex with a set of tree nodes. To define this formally, we represent each tree node as the set of vertices associated with it.
Thus, given a graph ''G'' = (''V'', ''E''), a tree decomposition is a pair (''X'', ''T''), where ''X'' = {''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a family of subsets of ''V'', and ''T'' is a tree whose nodes are the subsets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, satisfying the following properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Diestel|2005}} section 12.3&lt;/ref&gt;

# The union of all sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; equals ''V''. That is, each graph vertex is associated with at least one tree node.
# For every edge (''v'', ''w'') in the graph, there is a subset ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; that contains both ''v'' and ''w''. That is, vertices are adjacent in the graph only when the corresponding subtrees have a node in common.
# If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; both contain a vertex ''v'', then all nodes ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of the tree in the (unique) path between ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; contain ''v'' as well. That is, the nodes associated with vertex ''v'' form a connected subset of ''T''. This is also known as coherence, or the ''running intersection property''. It can be stated equivalently that if &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_k&lt;/math&gt; are nodes, and &lt;math&gt;X_k&lt;/math&gt; is on the path from &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X_j&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;X_i \cap X_j \subseteq X_k&lt;/math&gt;.

The tree decomposition of a graph is far from unique; for example, a trivial tree decomposition contains all vertices of the graph in its single root node.

A tree decomposition in which the underlying tree is a [[path graph]] is called a path decomposition, and the width parameter derived from these special types of tree decompositions is known as [[pathwidth]].

A tree decomposition (''X'', ''T'' = (''I'', ''F'')) of treewidth ''k'' is ''smooth'', if for all &lt;math&gt;i \in I : |X_i| = k + 1&lt;/math&gt;, and for all &lt;math&gt;(i, j) \in F : |X_i \cap X_j| = k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="b96"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum number of trees in a tree decomposition is the '''tree number''' of ''G.''

==Treewidth==
{{main|Treewidth}}
[[File:Treedecompsnocolour.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Two different tree-decompositions of the same graph]]
The ''width'' of a tree decomposition is the size of its largest set ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; minus one.   The [[treewidth]] tw(''G'') of a graph ''G'' is the minimum width among all possible tree decompositions of ''G''. In this definition, the size of the largest set is diminished by one in order to make the treewidth of a tree equal to one. Treewidth may also be defined from other structures than tree decompositions, including [[chordal graph]]s, [[bramble (graph theory)|brambles]], and [[haven (graph theory)|havens]].

It is NP-complete to determine whether a given graph ''G'' has treewidth at most a given variable ''k''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Arnborg|Corneil|Proskurowski|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, when ''k'' is any fixed constant, the graphs with treewidth ''k'' can be recognized, and a width ''k'' tree decomposition constructed for them, in linear time.&lt;ref name="b96"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The time dependence of this algorithm on ''k'' is exponential.

==Dynamic programming==
At the beginning of the 1970s, it was observed that a large class of combinatorial optimization problems defined on graphs could be efficiently solved by non-serial [[dynamic programming]] as long as the graph had a bounded ''dimension'',{{sfnp|Bertelé|Brioschi|1972}} a parameter related to treewidth. Later, several authors independently observed, at the end of the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Arnborg|Proskurowski|1989}}; {{harvtxt|Bern|Lawler|Wong|1987}}; {{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that many algorithmic problems that are [[NP-completeness|NP-complete]] for arbitrary graphs may be solved efficiently by [[dynamic programming]] for graphs of bounded treewidth, using the tree-decompositions of these graphs.

As an example, consider the problem of finding the [[maximum independent set]] in a graph of treewidth ''k''. To solve this problem, first choose one of the nodes of the tree decomposition to be the root, arbitrarily. For a node ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the tree decomposition, let ''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the union of the sets ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' descending from ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. For an independent set ''S''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', let ''A''(''S'',''i'') denote the size of the largest independent subset ''I'' of ''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that ''I''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''S''. Similarly, for an adjacent pair of nodes ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', with ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' farther from the root of the tree than ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', and an independent set ''S''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', let ''B''(''S'',''i'',''j'') denote the size of the largest independent subset ''I'' of ''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that ''I''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''S''. We may calculate these ''A'' and ''B'' values by a bottom-up traversal of the tree:
:&lt;math&gt;A(S,i)=|S| + \sum_{j} \left(B(S\cap X_j, j,i) - |S\cap X_j|\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B(S,i,j)=\max_{S'\subset X_i\atop S=S'\cap X_j} A(S',i)&lt;/math&gt;
where the sum in the calculation of &lt;math&gt;A(S,i)&lt;/math&gt; is over the children of node &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;.

At each node or edge, there are at most 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; sets ''S'' for which we need to calculate these values, so if ''k'' is a constant then the whole calculation takes constant time per edge or node. The size of the maximum independent set is the largest value stored at the root node, and the maximum independent set itself can be found (as is standard in dynamic programming algorithms) by backtracking through these stored values starting from this largest value. Thus, in graphs of bounded treewidth, the maximum independent set problem may be solved in linear time. Similar algorithms apply to many other graph problems.

This dynamic programming approach is used in [[machine learning]] via the [[junction tree algorithm]] for [[belief propagation]] in graphs of bounded treewidth. It also plays a key role in algorithms for computing the treewidth and constructing tree decompositions: typically, such algorithms have a first step that [[approximation algorithm|approximates]] the treewidth, constructing a tree decomposition with this approximate width, and then a second step that performs dynamic programming in the approximate tree decomposition to compute the exact value of the treewidth.&lt;ref name="b96"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''Vámos matroid''' or '''Vámos cube''' is a [[matroid]] over a set of eight elements that cannot be [[Matroid representation|represented as a matrix]] over any [[field (mathematics)|field]]. It is named after English mathematician [[Peter Vámos]], who first described it in an unpublished manuscript in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last = Vámos | first = P.
 | title = On the representation of independence structures
 | year = 1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The Vámos matroid has eight elements, which may be thought of as the eight vertices of a [[cube]] or [[cuboid]]. The matroid has rank 4: all sets of three or fewer elements are independent, and 65 of the 70 possible sets of four elements are also independent. The five exceptions are four-element circuits in the matroid. Four of these five circuits are formed by faces of the cuboid (omitting two opposite faces). The fifth circuit connects two opposite edges of the cuboid, each of which is shared by two of the chosen four faces.

Another way of describing the same structure is that it has two elements for each vertex of the [[diamond graph]], and a four-element circuit for each edge of the diamond graph.

==Properties==
*The Vámos matroid is a [[paving matroid]], meaning that all of its circuits have size at least equal to its [[matroid rank|rank]].&lt;ref name="oxley"&gt;{{citation

*The Vámos matroid is isomorphic to its [[dual matroid]], but it is not identically self-dual (the isomorphism requires a nontrivial permutation of the matroid elements).&lt;ref name="oxley"/&gt;
*The Vámos matroid cannot be represented over any field. That is, it is not possible to find a [[vector space]], and a system of eight vectors within that space, such that the matroid of [[linear independence]] of these vectors is isomorphic to the Vámos matroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, pp. 170–172.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it is one of the smallest non-representable matroids,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, Prop. 6.4.10, p. 196.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4360">In [[computer science]], '''GSAT''' and '''WalkSAT''' are [[Local_search (optimization)|local search]] [[algorithm]]s to solve [[Boolean_satisfiability_problem|Boolean satisfiability problems]].

Both algorithms work on [[Well-formed formula|formulae]] in [[Boolean logic]] that are in, or have been converted into, [[conjunctive normal form]]. They start by assigning a random value to each variable in the formula. If the assignment satisfies all [[Clause (logic)|clauses]], the algorithm terminates, returning the assignment. Otherwise, a variable is flipped and the above is then repeated until all the clauses are satisfied. WalkSAT and GSAT differ in the methods used to select which variable to flip.

GSAT makes the change which minimizes the number of unsatisfied clauses in the new assignment, or with some probability picks a variable at random.

WalkSAT first picks a clause which is unsatisfied by the current assignment, then flips a variable within that clause. The clause is picked at random among unsatisfied clauses. The variable is picked that will result in the fewest previously satisfied clauses becoming unsatisfied, with some probability of picking one of the variables at random. When picking at random, WalkSAT is guaranteed at least a chance of one out of the number of variables in the clause of fixing a currently incorrect assignment. When picking a guessed-to-be-optimal variable, WalkSAT has to do less calculation than GSAT because it is considering fewer possibilities.

The algorithm may restart with a new random assignment if no solution has been found for too long, as a way of getting out of [[Local minimum|local minima]] of numbers of unsatisfied clauses.

Many versions of GSAT and WalkSAT exist. WalkSAT has been proven particularly useful in solving satisfiability problems produced by conversion from [[automated planning]] problems. The approach to planning that converts planning problems into Boolean satisfiability problems is called [[satplan]].

'''MaxWalkSAT''' is a variant of WalkSAT designed to solve the [[MAX-SAT|weighted satisfiability problem]], in which each clause has associated with a weight, and the goal is to find an assignment—one which may or may not satisfy the entire formula—that maximizes the total weight of the clauses satisfied by that assignment.

A '''weighted network''' is a network where the ties among nodes have weights assigned to them. A [[Network (mathematics)|network]] is a system whose elements are somehow connected (Wasserman and Faust, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, S., Faust, K., 1994. Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications. Cambridge University Press, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of a system are represented as nodes (also known as actors or vertices) and the connections among interacting elements are known as ties, edges, arcs, or links. The nodes might be neurons, individuals, groups, organisations, airports, or even countries, whereas ties can take the form of friendship, communication, collaboration, alliance, flow, or trade, to name a few.

In a number of real-world networks, not all ties in a network have the same capacity. In fact, ties are often associated with weights that differentiate them in terms of their strength, intensity, or capacity (Barrat et al., 2004) &lt;ref name="barrat04"&gt;{{Cite journal

By recording the strength of ties,&lt;ref&gt;http://toreopsahl.com/2009/02/06/operationalisation-of-tie-strength/&lt;/ref&gt; a weighted network can be created (also known as a valued network). Below is an example of such a network (weights can also be visualized by giving edges different widths):

Weighted networks are also widely used in genomic and [[systems biology|systems biologic]] applications. 
(Horvath, 2011).&lt;ref name="Horvath2011"&gt;Horvath, S., 2011. Weighted Network Analysis. Applications in Genomics and Systems Biology. Springer Book. {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8818-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) is often used for constructing a weighted network among genes (or gene products) based on gene expression (e.g. [[microarray]]) data (Zhang and Horvath 2005).&lt;ref name="ZhangHorvath2005"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16646834 | doi=10.2202/1544-6115.1128 | volume=4 | title=A general framework for weighted gene co-expression network analysis | year=2005 | pages=Article17 | last1 = Zhang | first1 = Bin | last2 = Horvath | first2 = Steve | journal = Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, [[Weighted correlation network analysis|weighted correlation networks]] can be defined by soft-thresholding the pairwise correlations among variables (e.g. gene measurements).&lt;ref name="Langfelder2008"/&gt;

==Measures for weighted networks==
Although weighted networks are more difficult to analyse than if ties were simply present or absent, a number of network measures has been proposed for weighted networks:
* Node strength: The sum of weights attached to ties belonging to a node (Barrat et al., 2004)&lt;ref name="barrat04" /&gt;
* [[Closeness centrality|Closeness]]: Redefined by using [[Dijkstra's distance algorithm]] (Newman, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Betweenness]]: Redefined by using Dijkstra's distance algorithm (Brandes, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([http://toreopsahl.com/2009/02/20/betweenness-in-weighted-networks/ details])
* The [[clustering coefficient]] (global): Redefined by using a triplet value (Opsahl and Panzarasa, 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 | pages = 155&amp;ndash;163
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The clustering coefficient (local): Redefined by using a triplet value (Barrat et al., 2004)&lt;ref name="barrat04" /&gt; or using an algebraic formula (Zhang and Horvath 2005) &lt;ref name="ZhangHorvath2005"/&gt;

A '''theoretical advantage of weighted networks''' is that they allow one to derive relationships among different network measures (also known as network concepts, statistics or indices.&lt;ref name="Horvath2011" /&gt; 
For example, Dong and Horvath (2007) &lt;ref name="DongHorvath2007"&gt;Dong J, Horvath S (2007) Understanding Network Concepts in Modules. BMC Systems Biology 2007, June 1:24 {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that simple relationships among network measures can be derived in clusters of nodes (modules) in weighted networks. For weighted correlation networks, one can use the angular interpretation of correlations to provide a geometric interpretation of network theoretic concepts and to derive unexpected relationships among them Horvath and Dong (2008) &lt;ref name="HorvathDong2008"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18704157 | doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000117 | volume=4 | issue=8 | title=Geometric interpretation of gene coexpression network analysis | pmc=2446438 | year=2008 | pages=e1000117 | editor1-last = Miyano | editor1-first = Satoru | last1 = Dong | first1 = Jun | last2 = Horvath | first2 = Steve | journal = PLoS Computational Biology| bibcode=2008PLSCB...4E0117H }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software for analysing weighted networks==
There are a number of software packages that can analyse weighted networks, see [[Social network analysis software]]. Among these are the proprietary software UCINET and the open-source package [http://opsahl.co.uk/tnet tnet].

The WGCNA R package implements functions for constructing and analyzing weighted networks in particular weighted correlation networks.&lt;ref name="Langfelder2008"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19114008 | doi=10.1186/1471-2105-9-559 | volume=9 | title=WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis | pmc=2631488 | year=2008 | pages=559 | last1 = Langfelder | first1 = Peter | last2 = Horvath | first2 = Steve | journal = BMC Bioinformatics}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
